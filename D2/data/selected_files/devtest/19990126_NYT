 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
MIAMI _ Atlanta coach Dan Reeves can issue a public apology every
day this week. He can jump on a stage and do the Dirty Bird to try
to change the subject.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But as long as the Falcons are playing Denver in Super Bowl
XXXIII, his feud with Broncos coach Mike Shanahan and quarterback
John Elway will be the most highly publicized angle leading up to
Sunday's game at Pro Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   When Reeves apologized Sunday night for his comments last week
that reignited a controversy that had been dormant for six years,
he wanted to put an end to the story that just won't go away _
certainly not this week, when his opponents are Shanahan and Elway.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, that's water under the bridge,''
Elway said this week. ``We've all gone our different directions. I
didn't think it deserved an apology.''
</P>
<P>
   When Reeves was in Denver with Shanahan and Elway, they were at
first one big, happy family. Slowly, Reeves' relationships with the
other two deteriorated, ultimately becoming a well-documented
family feud.
</P>
<P>
   When Reeves was fired, he blamed Shanahan and Elway, even though
Shanahan was coaching in San Francisco at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's never been a question in my mind that Mike Shanahan's
a great coach,'' Reeves said last week. ``I couldn't have been
closer to someone than I was with Mike. It (their falling-out) was
a tough thing, but it happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that I'll ever get over the full situation. I
don't know that Mike will ever get over that, what it caused his
wife and his children. Same thing with me. It caused a lot of pain
for my wife and my children. It's something that won't ever go
away.''
</P>
<P>
   When Reeves opened the old wounds at a news conference last week
in Atlanta, Shanahan was stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really surprised that this has been brought up,'' Shanahan
said. ``I can't believe he's going into past scenarios. If he wants
to bring up dirty laundry, there's nothing I can do about it. I
thought we both were going to take the high road going into this
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Their relationship dates to 1984, Reeves' fourth season as
Denver's coach. Pat Bowlen bought the Broncos that season, and
Shanahan got his first NFL job when Reeves hired him to coach
receivers. That was Elway's second season.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan did such a good job in his rookie season that Reeves
promoted him to offensive coordinator for the next three years. As
the coordinator, Shanahan coached Elway. They became close friends,
so much so that their families took vacations together.
</P>
<P>
   Elway's relationship with Reeves was strained, but at that point
the damage was not irreparable. Reeves was old school. He was tough
on his quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, he screamed at me a bunch,'' Elway said last week. ``I
didn't scream at him nearly as much as he screamed at me. Most of
the time, he had a right to scream at me. It never got any better
than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Many who played with Elway said the crux of his problem with
Reeves was a conservative system. Elway thought the system kept him
from compiling Dan Marino-type statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Elway was envious of Marino. Miami coach Don Shula tailored his
system to take advantage of Marino's incredible right arm. Reeves
made Elway fit his system.
</P>
<P>
   Marino threw 48 touchdown passes in 1984, his second season, and
the Dolphins reached the Super Bowl. Elway didn't play in his first
Super Bowl until after the 1986 season.
</P>
<P>
   After the Broncos lost a second consecutive Super Bowl to end
the 1987 season, the Los Angeles Raiders hired Shanahan as head
coach. Without Shanahan in 1988, the Broncos finished 8-8.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan never saw eye-to-eye with LA owner Al Davis. The
Raiders were 7-9 in 1988, and when they began the 1989 season 1-3,
Shanahan was fired. He didn't stay out of work for long, because
Reeves brought him back immediately as quarterbacks coach.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves' relationship with Elway had deteriorated badly, and
Reeves needed a buffer. Shanahan was perfect. Elway was so unhappy
that he was prepared to retire and enter his automobile-dealership
business full-time rather than play for a coach who made him
miserable.
</P>
<P>
   With Shanahan back, Reeves kept a firm hand on the controls, and
the Broncos finished 11-5. They beat Cleveland in the AFC
Championship Game for the third time. Then, they lost a third Super
Bowl in four years, and they bottomed out in 1990 with a 5-11
record.
</P>
<P>
   It was after the 1990 season that Elway first went public about
how much he detested playing for Reeves. Reeves became angry at
Shanahan. He accused Shanahan of hiding exactly how Elway felt
about the head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think he had my best interests in mind at the time,''
Reeves said last week. ``If John had a problem with me, and you're
coaching that position, why did I not know that prior to reading it
in the paper?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were the position coach, and you're that close to the
quarterback, why didn't I know that? Hey, this is something you
ought to sit down and talk about, that this is a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   When Shanahan heard last week what Reeves said, he became angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``How am I supposed to know how John felt about Dan?'' he said.
``I thought I did a great job of keeping that relationship intact
for seven years. He came to me and was very upset about it. I said,
`What are you talking to me for? John said it. Go talk to John.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I went down to the weight room and got John and brought him up
to Dan's office. I said, `John, you tell Dan why you don't like
him. Dan, you tell John why you don't like him. I'm tired of being
in the middle of this stuff.' So they both did.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Reeves promoted Shanahan to offensive coordinator
again, and the Broncos rebounded with a 12-4 record. But they were
not happy campers. After they lost the AFC Championship Game at
Buffalo, everything came to a head.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves thought Shanahan was telling Elway things that were said
about the quarterback in coaches meetings. Reeves also accused
Shanahan of scripting plays behind his back.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, looking back last week, said, ``You say things in a
coaches meeting as far as critiquing the play of someone that you
would never say to the player. If John ever got any bad feelings
about something I said, it never was done publicly. It had to be
something from a staff meeting that you said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does that mean Mike did it? You've got a lot of people on your
staff. (But) these are things that, in your mind _ I have no proof
of them _ I did what I thought was best for our football team.''
</P>
<P>
   Meaning he fired Shanahan and accused him of
``insubordination.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan said Reeves told him he was fired because Reeves wanted
to call the plays again. And besides, Shanahan said last week, if
Reeves admits now that he had no proof, why did he continue to
level the accusations?
</P>
<P>
   ``For a guy who doesn't have proof of something, he sure didn't
help my reputation,'' Shanahan said. ``To not have any proof but to
say somebody is insubordinate, that's one of the reasons I've had
such a tough time with this. That's a strong word not to have any
proof.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan believes the real reason he was fired is because ``Dan
wanted to run the offense, and he wanted complete control. He
really didn't want somebody with my type of personality around.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when Elway heard about the charges Reeves was
leveling against Shanahan, he said, ``I just know thinking back
that everybody had their own opinion, and the way Dan was looking
at it was totally different from the view that I'm sure Mike was
looking at.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it was different from the way I was looking at it. So
it's hard for me to understand why this situation got to where this
situation did.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan was hired by San Francisco as offensive coordinator in
1992. That season, the Broncos finished 8-8, and Reeves was fired.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Two reasons. First, like many owners, Bowlen wanted to be
Jerry Jones, a hands-on owner who ran everything and won a Super
Bowl. One problem: Bowlen wasn't Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The second reason involved Elway. He was miserable without
Shanahan and never forgave Reeves for firing him. And he hated
playing for Reeves. Elway gave Bowlen a him-or-me ultimatum.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves was fired. He was confused. He was crushed. He didn't
understand.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bowlen interviewed three candidates _ Shanahan,
Broncos defensive coordinator Wade Phillips and New Orleans
defensive coordinator Steve Sidwell.
</P>
<P>
   Elway wanted Shanahan. Bowlen thought Shanahan would jump at the
opportunity, but Shanahan learned his lesson with the Raiders _ he
wanted control.
</P>
<P>
   When Phillips was announced as the new head coach, the news
conference had been called to introduce Shanahan. According to
sources on the team at the time, Bowlen tried to low-ball Shanahan,
thinking he would accept, but Shanahan refused unless he got
control.
</P>
<P>
   Bowlen went to Phillips and, in essence, said, ``Wade, how would
you like to be head coach?'' Phillips didn't have to get full
control, so he was hired.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said last week he thinks Shanahan would have taken the
job if the public relations wouldn't have been so bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, Mike would have been hired when I was fired, but
there was too much public opinion that would have made it almost
impossible for him to do it,'' Reeves said. ``I think two years
later was a much better situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Two seasons later _ after the Broncos missed the playoffs and
the 49ers won the Super bowl _ Bowlen fired Phillips and gave
Shanahan a seven-year contract and total control.
</P>
<P>
   Until last week when Reeves blasted Shanahan and Elway, all
three said the problems were behind them. They talked during the
offseason at Augusta Country Club. When Reeves underwent heart
surgery late this season, Shanahan sent him a get-well card, and
Elway made a donation to his foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it (the firing) hurt his family,'' Elway said.
``But there were a lot of people hurt in the whole situation. It
wasn't just us three.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that it was a business relationship, and
Mr. Bowlen decided to make a move. The thing I regret is that it
got to that point. It's too bad.''

</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
MIAMI _ Each was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Reeves was too dictatorial and too much of a control freak.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Shanahan was a tad too cerebral for his own good, which
rendered him unable to show total deference to the authority of the
boss.
</P>
<P>
   And John Elway had an undisciplined streak, never mind a bratty
side and a penchant for misreading defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Each was also right, though.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, as the head coach, clearly had a right to have his
orders followed.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan possessed the more innovative offensive mind and
sharper instincts regarding Elway's needs.
</P>
<P>
   Elway, a non-traditional talent, needed a certain amount of
wiggle room to set free the genius within.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, Shanahan and Elway forged a good-enough partnership with
the Broncos to win three AFC championships and the corresponding
Super Bowl berths. They were never good enough together, however,
to go the next step and win the big game, which eventually set the
pot to boiling. Shanahan took the fall first at Reeves' hands, and
Reeves himself went down a year later in what came close to being a
me-or-him ultimatum from Elway, then as now Shanahan's staunchest
ally.
</P>
<P>
   We've been assured by all parties the hatchet has been buried.
It hasn't been, of course, but presumably only nice, politically
correct utterances will follow for the rest of this Super Bowl
week, no matter how relentlessly we prod and poke the three of them
with our pencils and microphones.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves already has apologized for going public with ``the
truth'' about what happened among the head coach, offensive
coordinator and superstar quarterback many years ago in Denver,
where to be of the Broncos family is to reside in a fishbowl inside
a glass house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I apologize for ever having brought it up, or having it affect
anyone,'' Reeves said. ``All I was doing was answering a question.
I'm not smart enough to have a strategy for anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan, for his part, has backed off on his implications that
Reeves, once his ``best friend,'' was a revisionist historian of
the first rank, if not an out-and-out fibber.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad it's over,'' Shanahan said.
</P>
<P>
   Over? Whoa, Mike, this thing is hardly over. It will remain the
underlying issue of Super Bowl XXXIII right on through the final
gun, no matter which side laughs last on the turf at Pro Player
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 33 jillion stories the 33 Super Bowls have generated
across a third of a century, this no-love-lost triangle stands out
for being unique, exceeding even the hype. Never before has The
Ultimate Game produced such a spicy, tantalizing entanglement,
where one team's coach once fired the other team's coach, only to
be brought down by the quarterback he must now try to beat.
</P>
<P>
   And we're supposed to believe each side wishes only the very
best for the other? Please.
</P>
<P>
   After his near misses in Denver, Reeves wants that ring any way
he can get it, particularly since Shanahan and Elway already have
theirs. But for him to secure same at the Broncos' expense, leading
a once-destitute Atlanta franchise that had done nothing of note
before his arrival, would be the ultimate of vindications, one
almost too rich to digest for a recovering heart patient.
</P>
<P>
   Although Reeves may never say, ``Take that,'' he wants to be
able to enjoy thinking it throughout the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   For Elway, in turn, to put a wrap on his career as a repeat
champion at the expense of a coach who had come to, he said, make
his life ``hell,'' would provide an ideal segue into a fully
satisfying retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides sincerely want to beat the other's brains out Sunday.
The more lopsided and embarrassing the outcome, the better. A
lingering score remains to be settled. That's just a fact, never
mind the polite platitudes and hollow homages we can count on
hearing repeatedly over the next several days.
</P>
<P>
   Bypass surgery gave Reeves a more mellow and appreciative life
view. He will now occasionally stop to smell the flowers and
dutifully count his blessings. It did not, however, make him any
less human, which is why he couldn't bite his tongue or stuff a
sock in his mouth last week.
</P>
<P>
   Despite fully realizing how radioactive the fallout from his
remarks would be, Reeves had to unburden himself because he still
feels wronged and because, deep down, he still sees Elway as an
ungrateful prima donna and Shanahan, the erstwhile prodigal son he
had kindly welcomed back from the evil Al Davis' clutches, as a
mutinous turncoat.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Shanahan and Elway see Reeves as hardheaded and
heavy-handed.
</P>
<P>
   This may no longer be a war of words, but it definitely remains
a real war.
</P>
<P>
   Which seems good for the Super Bowl. Too much of the game's
drama is of the manufactured variety. Reeves-Shanahan-Elway is the
real deal, darn near Jerry Springer material.

 By ALISON MITCHELL and ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As a weary Senate entered the third week of
impeachment proceedings, Republicans in a party meeting Monday
rejected a Democratic-backed proposal that would have ended the
trial against President Clinton without calling any witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, hoping to defuse a growing opposition to witnesses,
Senate Republicans worked behind the scenes in hallways and
hideaway offices throughout the day to persuade House Republican
prosecutors to draw up a modest witness list. The maneuvering came
hours before the Senate went into closed session Monday night and
debated for four hours a Democratic motion to flatly dismiss the
charges against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   With that motion given little chance of succeeding, the Senate
also will consider on Tuesday whether to allow witnesses to be
deposed. The outcome of that vote is uncertain. Trying to help
House prosecutors win the right to continue their case, Republican
senators advised them to put together a list small enough to keep
wavering Republicans from joining Democrats to form a majority
against witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday morning, spurred by the partisan strife set off by the
House prosecutors' questioning of Monica Lewinsky, Sens. Slade
Gorton, R-Wash., and Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., offered both
parties a proposal. They suggested that the votes on dismissal and
witnesses be skipped and that the trial move to closing debate,
with a vote on articles of impeachment on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman described the plan as a ``mutual withdrawal of
forces'' under which Democrats would drop the effort to dismiss the
case outright and Republicans would not push for witnesses. It was
presented to the Democrats and Republicans at separate caucuses
Monday morning, and Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority
leader, announced that Democrats could support the plan.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the Republican caucus was still under way, John
Czwartacki, the spokesman for Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the
majority leader, said the idea had been ``summarily rejected.''
Republicans said that their caucus was divided, with some people
exhausted and leery of witnesses but others still wanting to give
the House prosecutors the right to move forward with their case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard for me to envision as a trier of fact who has taken
an oath, judging this case, without seeing the most important
witness or witnesses,'' said Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio. Sen. Tim
Hutchinson, R-Ark., said there was a ``difference of opinion''
among Republicans over the need for witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody would like this thing to end, and they hate to think
of a couple of more weeks of depositions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After rejecting the offer, Senate Republicans summoned some of
the House managers to the Capitol to winnow the prosecutors' list
of half a dozen witnesses down to two or three, in hopes that such
a list could win a majority vote later this week, perhaps even
winning some Democratic support.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans were also examining a plan for the end of the
trial under which the Senate could vote to find that Clinton had
committed the offenses charged in the two articles of impeachment,
but not actually remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Senate is thought to have no chance of assembling the
67 votes to convict Clinton, some Republicans believe this would
amount to a stringent form of censure. It would take only 51 votes
for the finding of facts _ meaning that it could be muscled through
by the Republican majority. The Democrats say the plan is
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   To keep pressure on the White House, Lott and nine other
senators submitted 10 written questions to President Clinton,
taking advantage of an opening that the White House had given them
and then retracted on Saturday. They asked that he respond ``in
writing and under oath'' to the questions, which began by asking if
everything the president had testified to in the case brought by
Paula Jones was true.
</P>
<P>
   ``If not,'' the question continued, ``what did you testify to
that you now believe is not truthful? Please begin your answer with
a yes or no.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary, said neither
Clinton nor his lawyers would respond to the questions, which he
said violated the bipartisan deal on trial procedures. ``I'd
suggest this has more to do with playing politics than with trying
to bring this to a fair and expeditious conclusion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the two parties once again parted ways, efforts
persisted to search for a bipartisan solution. Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas, called Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., seeking support
for a two-person witness list and a date certain to end the trial.
After consulting Daschle, Kennedy relayed the message that the
Democrats were standing firm against witnesses, according to one
Democratic official.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One attempt at negotiation took place openly in front of a
cluster of reporters when Max Baucus, D-Mont., stopped abruptly in
the Senate's subway to ask Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, if the
Republicans had embraced the plan to move to the end of the trial.
``Could you think of an element that might help?'' Baucus asked.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley wondered in return whether Democratic opposition to
witnesses would extend to ``even a very circumscribed form for
witnesses, depositions, just a short period of time?'' Baucus said
it probably would, and the two men went their separate ways.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Facing a deadline of Tuesday to submit their witness list to the
Senate, the House managers _ a day after interviewing Ms. Lewinsky
_ began the day badly divided over how to proceed. Bowing to the
Senate's reluctance to call a large number of witnesses, some of
the prosecutors were willing to cull their list down to two or
three people, including Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But others continued to insist they needed to go beyond Ms.
Lewinsky and call a core group of five witnesses, to make their
case, including the White House aides and advisers Betty Currie,
Vernon Jordan, John Podesta, Sidney Blumenthal. There was also
interest in Clinton's former political consultant, Dick Morris.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debate is over who should be added and whether they'd be
accepted by the Senate,'' Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., one of the
13 House prosecutors said after they held a midday meeting. ``We
believe in our case and we want a way to present it, and we're
going to keep arguing that point to the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   But just as the meeting was ending, some of the prosecutors,
including Hutchinson and Rep. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina,
were summoned to a Capitol office by a small group of Senate
Republicans, including Sen. Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania
Republican, to discuss the witness issue.

 &UR; WASHINGTON: witness issue. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Monday night, the four prosecutors who will make the case for
witnesses on Tuesday _ Hutchinson, James Rogan of California, Ed
Bryant of Tennessee and Bill McCollum of Florida _ were paring down
the list, and one Republican aide said there would probably be no
more than three names submitted to the Senate. Even earlier in the
day Rogan had signaled that they would move in this direction.
``We've got to prioritize and get down to a bare minimum and not
run the risk of getting zero witnesses because we put on one too
many,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other than Ms. Lewinsky, it was not certain which witnesses the
prosecutors would settle on. Monday night, the managers were
leaning toward Jordan and away from Ms. Currie. They were also
looking at one of the two White House aides, either Podesta or
Blumenthal. They were to meet again on Tuesday before the trial
begins.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors did win one victory on Monday. Ruling a day
after the prosecutors interviewed Ms. Lewinsky, Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist rejected an effort by Sen. Tom Harkin, an Iowa
Democrat, to halt such interviews until after the Senate votes on
witnesses. In a letter to Harkin, the justice said, ``It is quite
debatable whether merely interviewing a witness'' violated the
bipartisan agreement establishing the vote on witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate went into closed session Monday night to debate the
motion by Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., to dismiss the trial. But the
pair of votes on that motion and on witnesses are not expected
until late Tuesday night or Wednesday. Lott said confidently that
the Republicans who control the chamber 55-45 ``have the votes'' to
block dismissal of the case.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And suggesting that even some Democrats might oppose dismissal,
Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., tried unsuccessfully to have the
vote on stopping the case, separated into two votes, one for each
article of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It was less certain how the Senate will vote on witnesses, a
motion that requires a simple majority of 51 votes to pass or fail.
Several Republicans have expressed unease at extending the trial by
calling the principals in the case. But it was not clear how many
of them would vote with Democrats against witnesses. If all 45
Democrats hold together to oppose witnesses, then six Republicans
are needed to prevent testimony. And some of the wavering lawmakers
are likely to be swayed by the scope of the House witness list.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody can show me that this will change the dynamics of
the trial,'' said Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., ``that's a different
story. I don't believe that's going to happen. But I haven't closed
my mind totally yet.'' He said a number of Republicans shared his
concern.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were also exploring whether they could end the trial
by voting on a statement of facts on each of the articles of
impeachment and then separately on the articles themselves. That
would allow senators to make a statement that Clinton had committed
perjury and obstructed justice as the House charged, but not to
remove him from office. Democrats said they would oppose such a
plan as unconstitutional.

EWING CHANGE? KNICKS WON'T HEAR OF IT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ The sermon topic Monday was the maligned
Patrick Ewing, as a passionate Jeff Van Gundy all but cited
Scripture and verse in an effort to save those who have wondered if
it is time to phase out the Knicks' aging superstar.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy was stomping out what he called Ewing
``misperceptions.'' When the Knicks' coach was asked if Ewing would
be a misfit for the sleeker Latrell Sprewell Knicks, or if his role
would be diminished, Van Gundy's face turned as sour as curdled
milk.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if Ewing's impact would be downgraded on a team that
will rely less on the relic post-up offense and more on the
drive-and-kick abilities of Sprewell and Allan Houston, Van Gundy's
eyes rolled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most often discussed and misperceived issue that surrounds
our team is that Patrick has to totally change the way he plays,''
Van Gundy said after his team's morning practice session at
SUNY-Purchase. ``We need Patrick to play well for us to be
successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is he going to take a back seat? There's no way he's going to
take a lesser role. Now, are we going to get the ball to him in
different spots? Maybe. When the ball is driven to the basket, he's
pulling out to get a 15-footer if it comes. It's unbelievable how
who shoots consumes everyone's mind. I don't understand the
obsession.''
</P>
<P>
   There are reasons for the fixation on Ewing. For 13 seasons he
has stood as a titleless fixture with hands raised in the paint. In
that time, he has neither opened himself up to the public nor
handed out multiple excuses.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing has rarely exhibited the verbal leadership his teammates
have privately craved and has not created himself as a sympathetic
figure. Mostly, Ewing has just smiled at his detractors and moved
on.
</P>
<P>
   But is there substance to the argument that Ewing will have to
change? Can Ewing adjust and tweak his game in order to blend in
with the Knicks' new approach?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going to play my role,'' Ewing said. ``Whatever they
ask me to do, that's what I'm going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   It sounds selfless and promising. It sounds as if Ewing, at age
36, is willing to disperse the weight of the offense as his career
inches toward the two-minute mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, he's not going to be the same guy he was at 27 or 26,
but he still brings a lot to the table,'' Herb Williams said.
``He's one of the 50 greatest player ever, and he's still going to
be Patrick. He can't change that after 13 years.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not Ewing's nature to fade into the background. And if
healthy, he won't. Van Gundy still expects Ewing to be a force, but
in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy is leaning on Ewing to rebound more on the offensive
boards, limit his turnovers and become the trailer in transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 13 years, I've been letting someone else do that,'' Ewing
said. ``I've been the one running down the court first.''
</P>
<P>
   In reality, it may not matter if Ewing can adjust. He has played
in only four games since he came tumbling down on his shooting
wrist in December 1997. About a week before training camp began,
Ewing talked about his wrist, a subject he has since shrugged off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, I'll get the strength and everything back,'' Ewing
said. ``It feels fine, or as fine as it can be. It's going to take
a year and a half before it feels the way it was before it was
injured.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the speculation about Ewing's ability to adapt to the
talent around him, no one knows when or if he will return to his
familiar form.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see,'' said Van Gundy, expressing some concern. ``One
thing, don't underestimate the heart of a great player. He knows he
has a lot to do to be able to come back from a serious injury like
that. I would never underestimate that. But to say definitively
that I know he's healthy and he's got what he had before he left, I
don't think we'll know that before we see him play for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing does remain: Ewing's stubborn streak. Although Van
Gundy would prefer to rest Ewing for a game here and there during a
packed stretch of four games in five nights, Ewing said: ``Games
off? I don't know about that.''
</P>
<P>
   From the sideline, Van Gundy has observed Ewing for almost 10
years. He wonders why so much is made of his shot attempts when
they have decreased over the last two seasons. He can't fathom
questions about Ewing's defensive rebounding when he averages more
than 10 a game.
</P>
<P>
   The coach's exasperation was noted as he passed a man in the
stairwell and shouted: ``Patrick rebounds! Patrick Ewing
rebounds!''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Van Gundy's cathartic defense of Ewing grows out
of the irrationally loyal side of a head coach who knows his star
is partly responsible for his rise. In other ways, he was just
trying to make an emphatic point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patrick won't say this, and I know it's going to be, `There
goes Van Gundy protecting Patrick,''' Van Gundy said. ``But just
please, someone watch the game.''
</P>
<P>
   People did watch last season. And many saw a Ewingless Knicks
team that seemed liberated. They watched Houston develop his
aggressive side, and glimpsed the old all-star l/iving within Larry
Johnson. Suddenly, the Knicks were less plodding and more poetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Esthetically, I would agree,'' Van Gundy said. ``It was more
free-flowing. It was pretty, but we shot a lesser percentage and
scored less points.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Van Gundy did discover a Knicks team that could
drive-and-kick and be effective with that style. Now, with Ewing,
that something new will be incorporated with something old.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look over the last eight or nine years, primarily we
were a post-up team,'' Van Gundy said. ``Now, we want to have five
equal parts: transition, drive-and-kick, pick-and-roll, post-up and
second shots.''
</P>
<P>
   The diverse Knicks. Now that's different. So far, Ewing has not
resisted the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still an adjustment process, but we're still having
fun,'' Ewing said. ``I think we have great talent. On paper, we
have a lot of talent. We just have to put it together and start
playing.''

   SIERRA-LEONE-TERROR (Freetown, Sierra Leone) _ ``I asked them to
kill me now,'' Mohammed Sesay remembered pleading after he was
caught by rebels gripping machetes. But they ignored him. They held
his arms flat on a tree stump. And he felt the machete fall on a
wrist, then on the other. ``This is an example to show the
president,'' the rebels told him. Hacking off hands and feet of
ordinary people has been a key weapon of a widespread campaign of
terror and butchery waged by rebels trying to overthrow this
ravaged country's president. In recent days, the fighting has
reached the capital, marking another brutish turn in a civil war
that has pushed Sierra Leone to the brink of disintegration. By

the advancement of elections in China, or lack thereof: In
December, the leader of a township was directly elected by the

lower-level village elections. But this month, Beijing clearly
signaled that this must not be emulated. People are speculating
about whether there is high-level disagreement, or the leaders just

BENNETT'S ADVICE: EAT FOOTBALL, BUT MOSTLY SLEEP FOOTBALL
</HEADLINE>

 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The warning bells inside the head of Atlanta Falcons
linebacker Cornelius Bennett were ringing loudly Monday, as the
chaotic seven days known as Super Bowl week began. He heard
teammates talking about their plans _ their party plans. He heard
them discuss which clubs they were going to, the beautiful women
they were going to see, the sights and sounds they were going to
enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   When some of the Falcons players were talking about game plans,
it had nothing to do with studying the X's and O's for Super Bowl
XXXIII against the Denver Broncos on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett has heard it all before, and it scares him. He spent
most of his 12-year career with the Buffalo Bills before signing
with the Falcons before the 1996 season. He knows the craziness
that is the Super Bowl experience better than anyone else on the
team _ Bennett has played in four of them _ and he has a warning
for the Falcons: This week will be one of the most intense of your
lives and there can indeed be such a thing as having too much fun.
</P>
<P>
   He blamed much of the Bills' loss in Super Bowl XXV in Tampa,
Fla., in 1991 on his team's excessive partying. Bills players were
often seen closing local clubs, not leaving until the sun came up
and even staying out late the night before the game.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo was heavily favored to beat the Giants, but lost in the
final seconds after a Scott Norwood field goal sailed wide right.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, meanwhile, mainly stuck to their curfew set by Coach
Bill Parcells. It became clear as the week went on which team was
more focused _ it was the Giants. In the end, that focus paid off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We partied too much, plain and simple,'' Bennett said. ``I
think a lot of guys lost focus on why we were there. It hurt us in
the game, too. We were tired late in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett is one of the frankest players in the National Football
League, and he admitted that he stayed out late along with his
teammates leading up to Super Bowl XXV. Bennett said he would not
make that mistake again.
</P>
<P>
   With the week now getting busy, potential distractions are
beginning to swirl around the Falcons and Broncos. The team that
handles those distractions better will most likely win on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Denver Coach Mike Shanahan said that he learned a lot about
getting his team to focus on the Super Bowl last season in San
Diego. Concerned about how distractions could affect the players,
he put in the game plan days before the team arrived in San Diego.
Once there, the Broncos simply polished what they had already
practiced.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan liked that idea so much _ Denver beat a Green Bay team
that was heavily favored _ he did the same thing this year. And he
instilled in his players a phrase they are already using: ``This is
a business trip.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this city might hold some special distractions, so I
really emphasized to them to focus on the job at hand,'' Shanahan
said. ``It's a beautiful city, there is a lot to do, you can get
caught up in a bunch of things instead of focusing on football.
That's why I told them this is a business trip, nothing else. Have
your fun, but get to bed and be ready to practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan has given the Broncos a 1 a.m. curfew.
</P>
<P>
   For players, distractions have always been a part of a Super
Bowl. There are tickets to get for family members and friends, not
to mention hotel arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   But focusing on the game may have become harder than ever. The
crush of the news media is unlike it was even 10 years ago as
players are asked to spend more time talking to reporters. Unlike
the regular season, when players usually meet with the news media
in the late morning or the afternoon, during Super Bowl week the
players meet with reporters beginning at about 7 a.m. on Tuesday,
Wednesday and Thursday. Miss the session, and there is a
five-figure fine.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with the news media can be annoying, but it is the least
of a player's potential problems. Players are extremely visible,
rich and physically fit. In a city like Miami, with some of the
best dance clubs and bars, the temptation is strong to stay out
late and have fun.
</P>
<P>
   That is what Atlanta safety Eugene Robinson asserts happened to
the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XXXI in New Orleans in 1997.
Robinson played with Green Bay, which won the game, 35-21. He said
that the Packers players had a 1 a.m. curfew and most of them, if
not all, abided by it. Robinson said he believed that Patriots
players stayed out too late for much of the week and that it showed
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were fresh all game,'' Robinson said, ``and the Patriots
were tired, I think starting in the second quarter.'' In the second
quarter, the Packers went on a 17-0 run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake about it,'' Robinson said, ``this team will
get its sleep. I'm going to make sure of it. We are going to stay
focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Denver tight end Shannon Sharpe said the Packers team that the
Broncos beat last year was not as focused on the game as the
Broncos were. ``You could tell by the comments they were making and
the way they carried themselves,'' he said of the Packers. ``We
didn't go out and hang out as much as they did, while I know some
of my friends on the Packers said after the game they had partied a
lot during the week because they didn't think we could beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Packers have denied that they were overconfident or that
they stayed out excessively late the week leading up to that game.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons had no curfew Monday night, but beginning Tuesday,
players said, they have a 1 a.m. curfew. Bennett and Robinson plan
to make sure their teammates stick to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell them how to lose the game,'' Bennett said, ``and
Eugene can tell them how to win it. If we focus and practice hard,
we can win. If we don't, we can lose. It's that simple.'' &QL;

   NEW YORK _ ``You know why it was so hard to find a chairman?''
Tim Zagat, the restaurant-guide publisher, asked. ``Fran insisted
she find somebody with the same birth date as she had.''
</P>
<P>
   Fran is Fran Reiter, the former deputy mayor-turned-president of
the New York City Convention and Visitors Bureau. And the new
chairman will be Zagat himself, who, like Ms. Reiter, was born on
May 13.
</P>
<P>
   That was not his main qualification, of course. He had become
closely identified with a program that coordinated the low-price
lunches many restaurants offered during the 1992 Democratic
National Convention ($19.92 in 1992, $19.93 in 1993 and so on).
That program merged with the Convention and Visitors Bureau last
year.
</P>
<P>
   His first move as chairman will be to change the name of the
organization to NY &AMP; Co. and to broaden its reach beyond tourism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same message you give to tourists about being safer,
cleaner and more fun are messages you can give to businesses
contemplating coming here,'' Zagat said. Sounding as if he was
reciting a four-star review of Ms. Reiter's former boss, he added,
``The mayor has given us an easier job of selling the city. Safety
and cleanliness go a long way to assuaging criticisms people had.''
</P>
<P>
   Heading East
</P>
<P>
   Rolland Smith, who was an anchor on WCBS-TV and WWOR-TV before
he left for similar on-camera duty in San Diego, is switching
coasts again. Smith has joined the Regional News Network, which
provides newscasts seen on cable systems in the New York region.
The studios are 87 miles from Manhattan, in Kingston, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   No problem, said Smith, who will anchor three nightly newscasts
from Kingston. ``Where you are based, it really doesn't matter
these days. You can get and disseminate information from almost
anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Musical Lawyers
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Duff has new lawyers in her custody fight against her
former husband, the Revlon titan Ronald Perelman.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, lawyers for another former Perelman wife, the gossip
reporter Claudia Cohen, complained of conflict of interest. The
issue: that Ms. Duff's lawyers _ Ken Warner and Rita Warner _ had
represented Ms. Cohen briefly in 1995 and '96.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Warner called the complaint ``a tactical ploy'' that
benefited Perelman.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Franklin Weisberg said the Warners could not
continue on Ms. Duff's team. (Ms. Cohen did not return a call for
comment.)
</P>
<P>
   Then Ms. Duff discharged her other lawyer, William Beslow. Her
spokesman issued a statement saying that Beslow had had only ``a
limited role'' in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Duff's next move was to hire three other lawyers _ Harriet
Cohen, Patricia Hennessey and Bonnie Rabin. On Monday, Weisberg
adjourned the proceedings until Feb. 8 so they could familiarize
themselves with the case.
</P>
<P>
   Ivana at Home
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Welcome to my home,'' a line on Ivana Trump's new
magazine said, and that was exactly what she did Monday. More than
20 photographers stood on the thick red carpet and took picture
after picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``How to look great in photos,'' another line on the cover
promised. She kept smiling as flash after blinding flash lit the
room for a fraction of a second in her town house on the Upper East
Side .
</P>
<P>
   It did not seem to matter that her name is not on the masthead
of Ivana's Living in Style magazine, which she said will be
distributed by the company that publishes the supermarket tabloid
The Globe. Between facing the photographers and sipping champagne,
Ms. Trump said that being involved with a magazine was easier than
appearing on cable-television shopping channels. ``I can be on the
air nine hours a day, and have to talk all that time,'' she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Someday, perhaps, the Kings and Mighty Ducks will meet in a
postseason series that will ignite their neighborhood rivalry and
generate hockey interest in an area that usually yawns at the
sport.
</P>
<P>
   Someday, perhaps, but not this season.
</P>
<P>
   As the two locals prepare to resume play following the All-Star
break, the Ducks are lodged in one of the Western Conference's
nether playoff berths, and the Kings are in danger of falling out
of the race altogether.
</P>
<P>
   One of the two locals probably will make the playoffs but not
both, and neither team's postseason prospects create much reason
for excitement.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they have been virtually free of major injuries,
even though Paul Kariya leads the NHL in scoring, and even though
Teemu Selanne is poised for a strong second half, the Mighty Ducks
are two games below .500.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Kings, they've suffered one major injury after
another, are weeks from regaining key winger Glen Murray, and begin
a trip Wednesday in Dallas that could deepen the hole they've dug
for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers tell a gloomy tale: The Kings are 0-12 when trailing
after one period, 8-13-3 at home, have no one other than Luc
Robitaille and Murray with more than eight goals, and are 3-7-4
this year when they are tied after the second period. This dismal
legacy seems far too great for them to overcome in a 37-game sprint
to the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks, at least, appear to have an immediate upside in the
double-threat of Kariya and Selanne, but who can predict? The only
thing predictable about the two Southern California teams in recent
years has been their unpredictability.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the Ducks had 85 points and made the playoffs,
the Kings had 67 and missed. Last year, the Kings had 87 points and
made the playoffs, the Ducks had 65 and missed. This year, the
teams have flip-flopped once again.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is clear, though: Another half-season of hockey has
passed and both teams remain several notches below where they need
to be to raise any hopes of contention for a Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   __ Eye for an eye: Florida's Dino Ciccarelli was irate last week
after receiving a two-game suspension from the NHL for slashing
Buffalo's Jason Woolley, who was uninjured on the play.
</P>
<P>
   What angered Ciccarelli was that the Sabres' Alexei Zhitnik did
not receive discipline for a cross check that left his left eye
almost entirely shut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand the logic here,'' Ciccarelli said. ``My eye
is three-quarters closed because some guy cross checks me in the
head, and they don't do anything. They're acting like this was
premeditated and I did it intentionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said I was trying to (retaliate) for my eye, but Jason
Woolley would be the last guy I'd try to hurt. If I wanted to get
anybody back, I would have got the guy that almost cut my eyeball
open.''
</P>
<P>
   Ciccarelli also was angry because he says referee Don Van
Massenhoven asked him for a hockey stick after the game, and upon
receiving it, Ciccarelli says Van Massenhoven promised he would not
report the slash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The referee wants hockey sticks,'' Ciccarelli said. ``He said,
`Don't worry, they won't review this. I know you didn't mean to
hurt him. It was an accident and we know he's not hurt. We're not
going to report this, but can I have one of your hockey sticks?' So
I signed a hockey stick for him. Is that unbelievable?''
</P>
<P>
   __ Chelios for sale?: The New York Post reported that Chicago is
preparing to shop veteran defenseman Chris Chelios to the highest
bidder, a report Blackhawks management denied. Chelios, 37,
insisted he wants to remain with the lowly Blackhawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I swear on the heads of my four kids that I have no interest
in being traded,'' Chelios said. ``As bad as things are going here,
I don't want to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the kind of player who asks to be traded. When things
turn around here, I want to be leading the charge. I want to stay
in Chicago. I don't know how to put it any simpler. Things aren't
going good now, but I'm not a quitter. I'm going to fight through
this with these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia, Detroit and Phoenix are among the teams believed
to have interest if the Blackhawks decide to trade Chelios.
</P>
<P>
   __ Demanding coach: Though the Dallas Stars have the NHL's best
record, the players aren't exactly wild about coach Ken Hitchcock's
tactics. Last week, after a loss to Vancouver, Hitchcock skated his
players through 20 punishing minutes of starts and stops, saying he
did so because he felt the team was ``gliding'' into the All-Star
break.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what kind of message he wants,'' veteran Guy
Carbonneau said. ``If it's because he's mad at us, I don't know if
the timing was good. The last I looked, we're still in first place,
and there's not much that we don't do right.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Mike Modano: ``I'd hate to see it if we were 7-27.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Loose pucks: Vancouver GM Brian Burke got rid of Pavel Bure
one week and coach Mike Keenan the next. You can almost see a giant
headache vacating Burke's cranium. . . . New Jersey's Scott Stevens
apologized to San Jose's Brantt Myhres for recent comments about
the latter's bout with alcoholism. Nonetheless, Stevens was booed
every time he touched the puck during a recent visit to San Jose,
and during a celebrity look-alikes segment on the scoreboard,
Stevens' photo was displayed next to a picture of the rear end of a
horse. . . . Former Detroit defenseman Vladimir Konstantinov, whose
career was ruined when he suffered massive head injuries in a
limousine accident after the Red Wings won the Stanley Cup in 1997,
is not expected to accompany his former teammates Thursday when
they visit the White House. ``I think his understanding of the
event is very limited,'' said Konstantinov's wife, Irina. ``He
can't put together why he is in the White House. It's not like when
he was on the ice in Washington after they won the Cup last spring,
he understood what was going on then because he recognized the
experience.'' &QL; 
BLUE LINES
</P>
<P>
   __ Any takers?: How badly does Philadelphia GM Bob Clarke want
to unload disappointing center Alexandre Daigle and his $1.9
million salary?
</P>
<P>
   ``We sent a fax out to all the teams to see if there was any
interest in him and a few teams called,'' Clarke said. ``I wouldn't
say there's anything imminent right now. But if we can get somebody
back that can help us, we'll trade him.''
</P>
<P>
   Kings GM Dave Taylor denied reports of a deal that would send
struggling defenseman Steve Duchesne to Philadelphia for Daigle, a
one-time first overall draft choice and a one-time boyfriend of
``Baywatch'' 's Pamela Lee.!dlim!You gotta have heart!dlim!
</P>
<P>
   Red Wings legend Ted Lindsay was quoted as saying that if Sergei
Fedorov had half the heart of teammate Steve Yzerman, he'd be the
best player in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   Fedorov replied: ``Steve Yzerman should keep his heart. I've got
my own. And I've got one that's as big as anyone in this room.'' &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Upstairs, the impeachment trial was going through
serial delays as the Senate once more struggled to hold off
partisan meltdown. But downstairs, at least, at the head of an
escalator, the senior senator from Iowa politely yielded basement
debating time to the senior senator from Montana.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did your caucus conclude?'' asked Max Baucus, D-Mont., of
Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, when his colleague recognized him for an
impromptu two-lawmaker debate on a free fall of a day in President
Clinton's impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my understanding,'' replied Grassley over the escalator
hum, ``that there's something going on between some very senior
respected senators on both sides that could bring something
about.''
</P>
<P>
   It was as if Webster's timeless question of ``Neighbor, how
stands the Union?'' were being put once more in the very bowels of
the Senate as the president's fate was being settled. The jury was
not yet out, but rather out and about, trying to figure out what
was going on as they met in hallway encounters.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of tourists, staffers and reporters gathered around the
two, as they discussed witnesses and other issues in the day's
private leadership attempt at striking a deal to speed the trial to
conclusion. If nothing else the exchange demonstrated the senators'
civility had hardly eroded to the levels of the House impeachment
debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't your concern that you want to make sure this doesn't go
on for a long time?'' Grassley politely asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right,'' responded Baucus as other pedestrians brushed past to
the Capitol's underground tunnels and lunchrooms. ``And, basically,
I'm trying to find a way to let people on your side who feel they
have to cast at least one vote to satisfy certain political
needs.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange was a microcosm of the caucus struggles through
much of the day centering on the question of ending the trial
fairly without yielding the House Republican managers a
time-consuming license to search for fresh witness evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't forget we're supposed to be running the show, not the
lawyers,'' Grassley stressed, yielding back the basement corridor
floor to his colleague.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our hope,'' replied Baucus with evident doubt, and the
two parted in search of the latest word on their leaders'
differences.
</P>
<P>
   In the corridors outside the caucuses, senators hurriedly passed
to and fro. The high hope in the Democrats' morning sound bites
fell flat by midday. But fresh attempts at reviving a deal were
quickly under way, driven by constitutional duty but also more
mundane factors as time consumption and the impatience of
constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the chamber, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist was being
treated to the Senate's ultimate fallback tactic _ a slow quorum
roll call of the members to mark time while assorted negotiations
were under way off the floor. Rehnquist obviously came prepared. He
calmly became engrossed in some private reading matter as the clerk
slowly, ever so slowly, intoned each senator's name in a dirge-like
ritual of time killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to the operations of the United States Senate, Mr.
Chief Justice,'' majority leader Trent Lott of Mississippi
smilingly apologized as the Senate went through start-and-stop
motions and trial debate finally arrived, nearly two hours late.
</P>
<P>
   The senators settled in. A considerate John McCain of Arizona
got a backslap of gratitude when he jerry-built a footrest to ease
the infirmity of his fellow Republican, Jesse Helms of North
Carolina. The Senate mood seemed to be relaxed, for all the
off-the-floor contention. Lott genially worked the Democratic side
of the floor, then nonchalantly hand-edited a word in a procedural
resolution to end a complaint and get the trial back on track.
</P>
<P>
   For two hours the Senate court sat silent, still far from their
showdown impeachment votes, but listening to debate by the
prosecution and defense on a proposed preliminary dismissal of the
charges against the  &QR; 
president.
</P>
<P>
   This seemed certain to fail in a vote expected in a day or two,
after the conclusion of the Senate's own private deliberations. But
after the long day of political caucussing and confusion, this
debate, even if facing a foregone conclusion, suddenly brought the
Senate back to the gravity of the case to banish the president.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors flatly termed Clinton a ``criminal'' and pleaded
with the Senate not to seek an easy way out by dismissal. ``You'll
guarantee contention,'' warned Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, the
chief prosecutor. ``You'll never get it behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   At nightfall, there came a simple, stark reminder of the
enormous stakes for the nation. The 100-member court was sealed in
the Senate to begin its own closed debate on the merits of the
proposal to end the trial now rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a little while for all of us to adjust our ears to a
forum without amplification,'' Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, D-Conn.,,
said afterward of a four-hour session in which the galleries were
empty and the floor microphones turned off as the senators
experienced jury-like isolation. He said Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va.,
had told the closed gathering, ``This is the way it was 30 years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ```I was there!''' responded Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., the South
Carolina Republican with the longevity record, Lieberman said,
adding, ``Once again in this ordeal, we've been through something
together.''

IOC OFFICIALS TO SCRUTINIZE SYDNEY BID
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ The International Olympic Committee will
send one of its vice presidents, Jacques Rogge, and its director
general, Francois Carrard, here next month to investigate the offer
of $70,000 in sports aid that was made to committee members from
Africa by a key figure of the Sydney bidding team on the eve of the
vote for the 2000 Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, Australian Olympic officials denied that Sydney
was now under the same level of scrutiny as Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   ``My overall impression is that the IOC is interested in tying
up any loose ends,'' said Sandy Hollway, the chief executive
officer of the Sydney Organizing Committee, which still needs to
raise $139 million to balance its $442 million sponsorship goal.
``There is no suggestion I'm aware of that Sydney did anything in
the same league as Salt Lake City.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollway said he had been reassured by Kevan Gosper, an IOC vice
president from Australia, that the visit of the Olympic envoys did
not represent a full-blown inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The international committee has said that all cities that had
bid for the 1996 through 2006 Olympics will be asked to provide
information about irregularities in the process. But Sydney has
already provided some information and, according to IOC President
Juan Antonio Samaranch, Carrard and Rogge are visiting ``to know
what exactly is going on and what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch expressed surprise at the promised payments and their
timing and said that if Rogge and Carrard found wrongdoing, a wider
investigation would be started. Rogge, as chairman of the
coordination commission for the 2000 Games, has visited Sydney
frequently.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, John Coates, president of the Australian Olympic
Committee, released documents that showed he had offered $35,000
each to IOC members Charles Mukora of Kenya and Maj. Gen. Francis
Nyangweso of Uganda for sports programs in their countries. The
offer was made on Sept. 22, 1993, at a Monaco hotel. The next day
Sydney defeated Beijing, 45-43, on the final ballot. The voting was
by secret ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Coates has acknowledged that he made the final-hour offers,
which included payments staggered over seven years, because he felt
Sydney's support was faltering in Africa. But he said the
inducements, which were made in the name of the Australian Olympic
Committee, did not constitute bribery or break IOC rules because
they were between national Olympic committees and not individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Australian officials have argued that the payments were an
extension of an audited program that had already committed about
$1.2 million to 11 African nations for their athletes to train in
the Australian capital of Canberra.
</P>
<P>
   IOC regulations do not prohibit sports exchanges between
national Olympic committees, but the question is whether Mukora or
Nyangweso benefited personally from the payments. Mukora, president
of the Kenyan Olympic Committee, is one of the six IOC members who
were expelled on Sunday. In its report on the Salt Lake City
inquiry, the IOC commission concluded that Mukora accepted direct
payments totaling $34,650 ``for his personal benefit.'' Mukora
maintained that the payments were for sports activities in Kenya
and that the money was put into a trust, but the committee
concluded that the trust benefited Mukora.

COLUMN: NEW VANDALS SCRATCHING UP THE SUBWAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You have to admire New York City Transit for the
speed it generally shows in covering up graffiti whenever it pops
up on buses and subway trains. It almost makes one wish that he had
the agency's paint concession.
</P>
<P>
   Around New Year's Day, for example, some mindless vandal who no
doubt refers to himself as an urban artiste spray-painted an
indecipherable scrawl on every column of the 86th Street station on
the No. 1 line. It was hideous. But within a few days, just as the
transit agency's rules require, the mess was wiped away with a
fresh coat of blue paint.
</P>
<P>
   What this suggests, of course, is that this subway defiler and
his many colleagues never disappeared. But they have been kept in
check, and some may have been permanently discouraged, by the
official policy of erasing their gibberish almost as soon as it
appears.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 10 years have passed since the last graffiti-covered
train was taken out of service. To give you an idea of the
importance of that final journey, the agency's Web site
(http://www.mta.nyc.ny.us) lists the moment _ May 12, 1989, on the
C line _ as a ``key event'' in New York subway history, along with
the debut of the token in 1953 and the demise of the Third Avenue
el in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, the same upbeat words cannot be written about the form of
vandalism that replaced graffiti as the bane of the subway system.
Transit officials have not only been unable to stop it, but many
riders are also convinced that the problem is worse than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Some call it scratchiti, a word that lends it an air of
near-dignity it hardly deserves. It is the etching of nicknames
into subway-car windows and walls, usually by teen-agers armed with
keys, coins, razor blades and, if you can believe this, super-sharp
rocks formed from lava, to be found in many hardware stores.
</P>
<P>
   The window scratchings are about as brainless as you can get.
Nobody pretends that they qualify as art, not even the likes of
Norman Mailer, who used to celebrate graffiti (and who was rarely
to be found on the IRT).
</P>
<P>
   True, subway riders are not as menaced by the etched graffiti as
they were by heavy sprays of black paint. Many say in interviews
that they have come to ignore it. But just as many say that it
sometimes makes them feel as if no one is in control.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the system's 5,800-plus cars are scratched up. Many
have not a single unscarred window. To this daily rider, it came as
a jolt while watching ``You've Got Mail,'' a cinematic love poem to
New York, to see Meg Ryan in a car free of blemishes.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Rappaport, coordinator for the riders advocacy group
known as the Straphangers Campaign, noticed some months ago that
the transit agency had stopped measuring scratched graffiti, while
continuing to rate subway litter and grime in its ``passenger
environment surveys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 100 percent every time,'' Rappaport said. ``Every car
had scratchiti. If you're not rating it, you're admitting that at
least for the short term there's not going to be any change.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, scratched subway windows have not received the intense
quality-of-life attention that City Hall has managed to give other
nuisances. Surely, with millions riding the subway each day, more
people are affected by this problem than were ever bothered by
squeegee men. Then again, the mayor is not to be found on the IRT
any more than Norman Mailer.
</P>
<P>
   But Joseph Hofmann is. Hofmann is the transit agency's subways
chief, and he says he has been meeting with police to figure out
how to crack down on scratchiti offenders, as they did with
graffiti spray painters. Beyond that, he said, he is looking to
protect the hundreds of new subway cars scheduled to join the
fleet, starting later this year.
</P>
<P>
   It would cost $65 million or more a year, a prohibitive expense,
to replace windows on a steady basis. Instead, Hofmann said, he
hopes to coat the windows of new cars with a polyester that might
not be scratchproof but would serve as a ``sacrificial barrier''
that protects the far more expensive glass.
</P>
<P>
   Solutions are not easy, Hofmann acknowledged. ``I don't think
it's something we're going to do overnight,'' he said. But he added
with determination, ``We're going to keep at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Encouraging words. Meanwhile, maybe some vandals will break
their arms and be knocked out of commission. If you think that
sounds mean-spirited, you, too, have not ridden the subways lately.

TIMES CRITIC WILL BECOME EDITOR OF GOURMET
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ruth Reichl has resigned her post as restaurant
critic of The New York Times and will join Gourmet magazine as
editor in chief starting at the end of April. Ms. Reichl will
replace Gail Zweigenthal, who will leave the magazine after 34
years.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Reichl, who in the interest of fair reviewing and
nonpreferential treatment has been known to visit restaurants
cloaked in elaborate disguises, wrote a weekly review, along with
articles and essays, since joining the Times in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved every minute of this job,'' Ms. Reichl said. ``But it
is not a job that anyone can do forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Gourmet, which is owned by Conde Nast, a unit of Advance
Publications, has faced increasing competition in recent years as
general-interest magazines devote space to cuisine _ like Martha
Stewart's Living, which is published by Martha Stewart Living
Omnimedia _ and publishers have introduced new magazines devoted to
food, like Time Inc.'s Cooking Light, which has a circulation of
1.4 million. Gourmet has a circulation of about 880,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many other magazines taking little pieces of what
should be its franchises,'' Ms. Reichl said. ``I don't want to read
the best food writing in The New Yorker, or about the best kitchens
in House &AMP; Garden. I want to bring new voices to Gourmet.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1990 to 1993, Ms. Reichl was both restaurant critic and
food editor for The Los Angeles Times. She is the author of
``Tender at the Bone: Growing Up at the Table,'' a memoir published
by Random House last year.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Lelyveld, the executive editor of the Times, said of Ms.
Reichl: ``She's a wonderful spirit and a wonderful critic and we
view this as a great loss. The search for her successor starts
today.''

LAKERS NEED ATTITUDE FIX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. _ Like besieged IOC president Juan Antonio
Samaranch, the beleaguered Lakers have at their fingertips the
answers to hard questions that first cropped up in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   All they have to do is pick up a hand mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Team magician Jerry West could produce an elite power forward
out of thin air tomorrow and it wouldn't improve the Lakers'
chances of winning an NBA title any more than the expulsion of a
few IOC members is going to purify the foul air at the top of the
Olympic hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is this: Whether you're the Lords of the Rings
or the lords-in-waiting for a championship ring, the gears of
change are yours alone to shift.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC's image is going to suffer until Samaranch takes
personal responsibility for the fact the fiefdom he runs has come
to stand for Interagents Of Corruption. The same goes for the
Lakers, who have to look inward if they're to put distance between
themselves and Utah.
</P>
<P>
   It says here the Olympic movement is worth saving as long as
Samaranch steps down. And the current Lakers roster is worth
preserving as long as everyone agrees to step it up.
</P>
<P>
   With the Lakers last spring, it wasn't the leadership at the top
that stank, it was the attitude in the trenches. You had Nick Van
Exel with his creaky knees and cranky attitude making vacation
plans, Shaquille O'Neal sneering more at his teammates than
opponents and everybody else snoozing and no one really digging in
to do the dirty work that wins games.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers grew so lackadaisical after their second-round
playoff dismantling of Seattle, it sometimes seemed as though coach
Del Harris was the only one who cared that the Utah Jazz proceeded
to thoroughly embarrass them in the Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about Harris' uncertain future (he is in the final year
of his contract). He remains the right coach to guide the Lakers to
the NBA Finals if you believe, as we unequivocally do, that there
are a lot of good coaches out there; what's really important is to
have a group of interested athletes.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers didn't have enough attentive players when they went
up against the Jazz with an NBA Finals berth at stake. Eddie Jones
and Kobe Bryant and Van Exel saw their shooting percentages swoon
and the Lakers were swept in four games on the strength of the
Jazz's tenacity and teamwork, not its superior talent.
</P>
<P>
   It's worth noting that the Lakers return almost intact the squad
that produced the NBA's highest-scoring offense in 1997-98. And
they've added two proven ancillary players in Travis Knight and
Derek Harper.
</P>
<P>
   In the shortened season that begins next week, a deep bench
driven by high-octane, low-mileage legs will be a decided
advantage. The Lakers have all that and someone to override their
cruise control, too. That someone is the 37-year-old Harper, who
brings 15 years of experience to his latest mentoring assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Count on him to be every bit as dependable as Chick Hearn. And
just as passionate.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, Harper has come a long way since dribbling out the
clock during Dallas' Game 4 conference semifinal loss to the Lakers
in 1984 (the Mavericks would bow out in five). He was the best
guard you never heard of during his first decade in Dallas, his
numbers good but never gaudy enough for him to divert the spotlight
from Magic Johnson and John Stockton and Clyde Drexler.
</P>
<P>
   He played a wonderful leading man during the 1994 NBA Finals
between his New York Knicks and the Houston Rockets but was
outshone, if not outplayed, by Houston's Hakeem Olajuwon in the
Rockets' seventh-game victory.
</P>
<P>
   Harper played in Orlando in 1997-98. It was a mediocre season
for the Magic but certainly not a mundane one for Harper. In
February he had to be removed from the court on a stretcher after
being hammered on his way to the basket during a game against
Minnesota. Less than two months later, his daughter, now 2, spent a
day in the hospital on life support and another two in intensive
care after nearly drowning in the family pool.
</P>
<P>
   After 15 seasons, Harper could have quietly retired with no
regrets. But he's got the same bug that Lakers forward Rick Fox
can't seem to shake. He wants to win an NBA title before he's
through.
</P>
<P>
   Harper and Fox have a passion that's contagious. You'd have to
have built up an immunity to greatness not to catch their fever.
The Lakers should consider themselves lucky. Unlike Samaranch, they
have a chance to nip their apathy in the bud before it has a chance
to destroy them.

DEVILS SEEM A SHOO-IN FOR PLAYOFFS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Contrary to popular perception, the National Hockey
League's playoff formula is not so inclusive. Only 16 teams qualify
for the tournament, and 11 do not make the cut. Six divisions this
season _ instead of four _ means two more automatic berths for
division winners.
</P>
<P>
   The scramble for the next 10 slots will leave a few respectable
teams idle when the regular season ends on April 18.
</P>
<P>
   Among the teams from the New York area, the Devils seem certain
to qualify. The Islanders almost certainly will not, and the
Rangers have only a poor-to-fair chance. With the All-Star Game
break over, the final 12 weeks should be intriguing, beginning
Tuesday night with the Rangers at Washington, Ottawa at the Devils
and Boston at the Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   Under their new coach, Robbie Ftorek, the Devils are more
exciting and less predictable. If they make a trade or two before
the March 23 deadline, it will be as much for fresh energy and
personality as for filling roster holes. Fourteen teams have given
up fewer goals, but that does not mean goalie Martin Brodeur is
having a bad year.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur, Scott Niedermayer, Scott Stevens and Bobby Holik
constitute a strong backbone. Should General Manager Lou Lamoriello
sprinkle a little pepper into his well-mixed stew, the Devils
should go beyond last spring's first-round ouster.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, who balked at the price for Pavel Bure, will face a
difficult decision as the trade deadline approaches. If close to a
playoff berth, the Rangers can offer spare parts or draft choices
for offensive forwards like Calgary's Theo Fleury or Montreal's
Mark Recchi. Due for unrestricted free agency in July, players such
as these could be short-term rentals for short-term goals.
</P>
<P>
   But should the Rangers fade, they might instead trade their own
players who are due to become unrestricted free agents, guys who
could help other contenders in a 90-day fling. These include Adam
Graves, Ulf Samuelsson and, yes, even Brian Leetch. In return, the
Rangers might get prospects or draft choices necessary for
rebuilding. Come summer, they could buy back their traded veterans
on the open market.
</P>
<P>
   With Bill Stewart as their new coach, the Islanders should
improve while Mike Milbury limits himself to his general manager's
role. But this franchise remains unsettled at most levels,
including ownership, arena and player personnel. As he demonstrated
with his trade of Bryan Berard for Felix Potvin, Milbury still has
much to prove as an executive.
</P>
<P>
   In the Eastern Conference, the surprise of the first half is
Toronto. The Maple Leafs are leading the Northeast Division under
the leadership of their president, Ken Dryden, the associate
general manager, Mike Smith, Coach Pat Quinn and Captain Mats
Sundin. But Toronto will leave Maple Leaf Gardens next month for
the Air Canada Center. Such changes usually disorient home teams.
The better teams in this division might be the Senators and the
Buffalo Sabres, young and hungry after a taste of playoff success
last spring.
</P>
<P>
   In the Atlantic Division, the Philadelphia Flyers seem settled
in goal with John Vanbiesbrouck. On offense, there is no duo more
dynamic than Eric Lindros and John LeClair, both among the leading
goal scorers.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the Devils, the Pittsburgh Penguins should stay
close. The Penguins' general manager, Craig Patrick, always plays
the hand he is dealt well. This season, the joker card is
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   The Carolina Hurricanes barely lead the Southeast, which might
send only one team to the post-season. Now that the Panthers have
Pavel Bure, Florida might be that team. The Capitals, who slipped
into the Stanley Cup finals last season, can be thankful that the
Tampa Bay Lightning will keep them out of the cellar.
</P>
<P>
   Defending the last two Stanley Cup championships, the Detroit
Red Wings are either complacent or wearing out in the Western
Conference. They may coast to the Central title with a record
barely above .500. Names heard in trade rumors include Brendan
Shanahan and Sergei Fedorov. With Nashville and Chicago struggling,
only mediocre St. Louis could make things even lukewarm for the
Wings.
</P>
<P>
   In the Northwest, Colorado's division lead is much like
Detroit's: unimpressive. But the Avalanche improved in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Mark Crawford has replaced Mike Keenan as the Vancouver
coach, the Canucks might give Edmonton a run for second place _ or
better. Crawford gets to coach twice against his former team, the
Avalanche. Could Mark Messier, in his second season with the
Canucks, be the next to go in Brian Burke's midseason
housecleaning?
</P>
<P>
   The city of Dallas is far from the Pacific Ocean, but its hockey
team leads the division of that name. The Stars also lead the whole
league. The eyes of hockey are upon them. The Stars have shown they
can win in Detroit this season and they gave the Wings a major
challenge in the Western finals last spring. Brett Hull is only the
newest of several shooting stars on a balanced offense.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix Coyotes, who faded slightly in the second quarter,
are still robust.
</P>
<P>
   With Paul Kariya healthy and leading the league in points, the
Mighty Ducks of Anaheim are fun to watch. And so are also-rans like
the San Jose Sharks and the Los Angeles Kings. Team for team, this
may be the NHL's most entertaining division. Thanks to late-night
telecasts on ESPN2, Eastern fans can keep up.

DEMOCRATS CLAIM FLAWS IN TAX CUT PROPOSED BY GOP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn., Del.)  (mk) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Republican proposal to cut income taxes by 10 percent across
the board means that millions of middle-class families would get
only part of the tax break and taxes would increase for large
middle-income families by as much as 14 percent, House Democrats
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is how the income tax system interacts with two other
laws, the alternative minimum tax and the child credit for
middle-class families that took effect last year. When tax rates
are cut more people become subject to the alternative tax, which
was originally adopted 30 years ago to make sure that no person
could avoid income taxes. Under the alternative tax system,
deductions for dependent children, as well as the child tax credit,
are cut or eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a family with six children making $71,000 would see
its federal income tax bill this year rise by $600, to $4,900 from
$4,300, a 14 percent increase, said John Buckley, minority chief of
staff for the House Ways and Means Committee. However, families
making more than $300,000 would get the full value of the 10
percent cut regardless of family size, Buckley said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rate cut's main sponsor, Sen. Rod Grams, R-Minn.,
said on the Republican's weekly radio address last week that ``the
across-the-board tax cut is simple.'' He continued: ``You don't
have to be a tax lawyer or an accountant to understand it. The
across-the-board tax cut is fair, because we're not pitting one
group of taxpayers against the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Grams ``will make any changes needed to insure that no one's tax
goes up and everyone gets a 10 percent cut,'' his spokesman, Steve
Behm, said Monday, adding, ``Assuming the Democrats are right, and
that's a big leap of faith, then he would solve the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. William Roth Jr., R-Del., the Senate Finance Committee
chairman, said that reforming the alternative minimum tax to exempt
middle-class families should be part of this year's tax
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican bill would lower each tax bracket by 10 percent.
The 15 percent bracket would fall to 13.5 percent; the 28 percent
bracket to 25.2 percent; the 31 percent bracket to 27.9 percent;
the 36 percent bracket to 32.4 percent, and the 39.6 percent
bracket to 35.64 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Republican plan, the bottom 60 percent of families,
those making $38,000 or less, would get an average $99 tax cut
while those in the top 1 percent income group, who make more than
$301,000, would save an average of $20,700 each, according to
Citizens for Tax Justice, a Washington nonprofit organization.

SAMARANCH ROOT OF OLYMPIC DECAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ After he pulled the rope on the trap door under a
half-dozen International Olympic Committee members that he helped
appoint, Juan Antonio Samaranch said something scary about the
IOC's growing bribery scandal, which almost daily takes a fresh
bite out of the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the beginning,'' he said, ``not the end, of our
work.''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC president probably first said similar words 40-plus
years ago while doing the work of Franco, the fascist dictator who
placed a few trap doors of his own under his Spanish subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Insofar as the scandal is in its infancy, Samaranch is right.
This thing is a lingering sore, destined to erupt regularly because
the virus is so deeply rooted.
</P>
<P>
   But for him to consider any reforms ``our work,'' meaning his
idea, is a stinging insult to anyone involved in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   It is Samaranch and his fellow IOC members who indulged the
universal atmosphere in which competing cities hoisted their civic
skirts in a fashion that would embarrass the Folies Bergere. Almost
by definition, it becomes impossible for him or any of his cronies
to pass fair judgment about who among them is clean or tainted.
</P>
<P>
   One of the dirty half-dozen, Jean-Claude Ganga of the Congo,
said he is convinced he is being singled out because of IOC
politics, not because he abused his privileges. It is no stretch to
assume that those members who see themselves as victims will be
more than happy to tattle on their fellow miscreants, creating in
the coming months a figurative food fight to rival ``Animal
House.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the scandal broke, Samaranch inadvertently acknowledged
the institutionalized nature of the graft. In an interview with
``60 Minutes'' that was broadcast on the final Sunday of the Winter
Games in Nagano, Samaranch was told of a $25 million ``donation''
that the Japanese bidders made to an Olympic museum, among many
other contributions offered for a favorable vote in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether any city had hope of securing an Olympics without
resorting to such means, Samaranch said, ``Well, it wouldn't be
easy _ it would be quite difficult _ but if they're getting the
Games, they would receive a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Samaranch didn't get it then _ or now. The ease with
which votes can be bartered on such a large matter leads to
suspicion on every decision rendered by the IOC and its staff,
including drug testing, Olympic eligibility and distribution of
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   In light of public awareness of how the Olympics are brokered,
how does an IOC official look the next Ben Johnson in his yellow
eyes and say, ``You're dirty, so get out''?
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch later tried to pull strings with CBS to get the
interview killed, claiming he was ambushed and that English was
only his fourth-best language. CBS resisted. That might seem like a
rare stand for journalistic integrity until it's realized that NBC
had bought up the telecast rights for the next half-dozen Olympics.
With nothing to lose, CBS could afford to take a stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were many questions like this,'' Samaranch said later of
the unexpectedly tough interview. ``I think it was not fair because
I was a businessman thinking it was my obligation to be kind to
CBS, that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch was disturbed because he rarely has to deal with tough
questions, especially from a network that once paid $375 million to
act as what amounts to the Olympics' propaganda organ. Like all
American networks, CBS was supposed to make nice.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there are no more Mr. Nice Guys. Newspaper editorialists
around the world Monday called for Samaranch's resignation after
his expulsion of the six despoilers, calling the measures
scapegoating. Samaranch held a press conference at Olympic
headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, to fire back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleased with myself, what I have done these 18 years,''
he said. ``I am not thinking of any kind of resignation.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch claimed no laws were broken in the Salt Lake City
scandal, which is true so far. It also is true that the IOC is a
private organization, and most of the money thrown at it by
competing cities was raised from private funds.
</P>
<P>
   But Samaranch and his cronies have created a worldwide emotional
colossus _ not to mention their own gravy train of privilege _ out
of the Olympics partly by appealing to humanity's desire for fair
play, noble conduct and dreams fulfilled. That huggable image is
part of why networks pay billions to tell its irresistible stories.
</P>
<P>
   In an era of growing cynicism toward sports, the Olympics'
opening ceremony and torch lighting remain a moment of exhilaration
and hope unsurpassed in human relations. But the people who helped
create the moment now are a threat to it because they have betrayed
the idealism that, however naively, was at its heart.
</P>
<P>
   For the Olympics, it isn't enough to say no laws were broken.
Samaranch, of all people, should know that. And as the man who
presided over the abuses, he is in no position to make credible
reforms. Nor are his cronies among the IOC membership.
</P>
<P>
   As he said, the work has only begun. Samaranch's trap door needs
to flap ceaselessly until he and his disingenuous way of doing
business no longer erode what is left of the Olympics' credibility.

FILIPINO CHAIN SET TO EXPAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A tickling taste of the Philippines is coming to
the Southland, and for Amalia Saravia and other local Filipinos
it's not a moment too soon.
</P>
<P>
   Manila-based fast-food chain Jollibee International plans to
open about a dozen restaurants in California, including eight in
Southern California, officials said Monday. Glendale, the San
Fernando Valley and downtown Los Angeles will each get their own
Jollibee.
</P>
<P>
   Saravia, who came to the United States from Manila in 1996,
still has fond memories of the seasoned burgers, succulent chicken
and other dishes that have made the Jollibee name one of the most
familiar in her homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of Filipinos here and they miss those Filipino
tastes,'' said Saravia, a bookkeeper for the Los Angeles-based
social services agency Filipino American Service Group.
</P>
<P>
   Special spices mixed directly into the burgers and other
techniques give Jollibee's offerings an ``Asian and tropical
twist'' that makes the chain so popular in the Philippines, said
Arnie Balague, general manager of the chain's California expansion.
</P>
<P>
   The chain was founded in Manila in 1978 by Tony Pan, now the
company's president. Since then, it has grown to 325 stores in
Asia, the Pacific Islands and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Jollibee made it's first United States appearance last May in
Daly City, just outside of San Francisco, Balague said. The chain
expects to add 12 California outlets over the next two years, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Southern California, Jollibee will open restaurants in areas
including Los Angeles, San Diego, Long Beach, Carson, Glendale,
Cerritos, West Covina and the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The Valley location has not yet been determined, but the chain
is focusing on sites around Panorama City, Balague said.
</P>
<P>
   In Northern California, the company will open restaurants in San
Jose, San Francisco, Union City and Vallejo.
</P>
<P>
   The 2,000- to 3,000-square-foot restaurants will each employ
about 50 full- and part-time workers.
</P>
<P>
   California offers fertile ground for the chain's growth in the
United States, said Balague.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jollibee is the No.1 fast-food chain in the Philippines. We
(carry) a certain national pride in the Philippines and we would
like to capitalize on that,'' he said. ``If you think of any state
in the United States where there's a good number of Filipinos, it
would be California.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the 1990 census, there were 219,653 Filipinos in
Los Angeles County, said Saravia. There are most likely many more
by now, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The chain's expansion is good news, Saravia said, because it
should mean more employment opportunities for area Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, she's happy Jollibee is coming for other reasons
beside national pride. ``I will be a customer,'' she said.

BULK IN A BOTTLE: YOUNGER ATHLETES TAKING RISKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Mark McGwire's record-setting home run race made 1998
a banner year for baseball and sports in general.
</P>
<P>
   But it also made it a banner year for an issue far more serious
and potentially devastating: athletes using performance-enhancing
substances to build bigger and stronger bodies.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's admission that he used two supplements, creatine and
androstenedione or ``andro,'' suddenly put new light on a
decades-old battle to stem the use of anabolic steroids and other
so-called ergogenic aids in athletic competition.
</P>
<P>
   With McGwire's admission has come a new set of concerns:
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)That more young athletes will attempt to use supplements
as a way of improving performance, fitness and recovery from
injuries, instead of building body strength naturally.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)That the supplements will be lumped together and
considered to be medically sound simply because they are available
over the counter or via mail order.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)That policies such as the University of Washington's to
administer creatine to athletes might some day create great
liability if medical complications are found in the future.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)That while creatine is considered medically safe, andro is
considered to be an anabolic steroid that can lead to several
potentially life-threatening diseases. Linking the two and using
both without proper medical supervision could prove dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   While McGwire will go down in the history books as the
unqualified home run champion for a single season, other athletes
who used similar substances last year faced far different
repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Petr Korda was forced to forfeit his rankings
points and $94,529 in prize money from Wimbledon after the
International Tennis Federation found he tested positive for an
anabolic steroid. His attempt to defend his 1998 Australian Open
title ended over the weekend, but his appearance stirred
controversy among his fellow players, who question how Korda could
have been allowed to compete.
</P>
<P>
   Despite warnings from the medical community and ethical
questions about unfair competition, athletes like McGwire and Korda
are big-name indicators that supplements have become ingrained at
all levels in the world of athletics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can easily blame ourselves and society for putting
professional and high-level collegiate athletes on such a pedestal
that it's going to influence our high school athletes,'' said Dr.
Mark S. Juhn of the University of Washington's Primary Care Center
Sports Medicine Clinic. ``I think that's a shame, but it's
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,
up to 13 percent of all high school athletes use anabolic steroids
and 40 percent of those athletes believe the illegal drug is not
harmful.
</P>
<P>
   Supplement use appears to be starting at younger ages. A study
published in May by the journal Pediatrics found that nearly 3
percent of boys and girls at four Massachusetts middle schools were
using anabolic steroids to build bigger bodies for sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ubiquitous, there's no doubt about that,'' said Charles
Yesalis, a Penn State professor of health and human development who
has written a book on the subject, ``The Steroids Game.'' McGwire's
admitted use makes him ``a very poor role model for kids, and he
can argue that it's legal to buy in society, but that's merely a
loophole in the laws. He can say anything he wants, but it's a
drug.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Olsen, president of the Washington Vocational Sports
Medicine Association and the head athletic trainer at South Kitsap
High School, has seen the problem first-hand and believes McGwire's
admission has only clouded the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who wants to be good at whatever they do has some sort
of a hero. And if their hero is using (a performance supplement),
then they will be more susceptible to it,'' Olsen said. ``They
think, `This can't hurt me because I don't have to have a
prescription for it.' They fail to realize that you can buy arsenic
too, but you wouldn't want to use it.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue becomes all the more confusing to the average young
athlete because creatine and andro are two entirely different
supplements.
</P>
<P>
   Creatine is an amino acid powder found naturally in skeletal
muscle, heart, brain, testes and other tissues. It is classified as
a dietary supplement that enhances muscle growth and weight gain,
and not a drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``Creatine is acceptable, and it does enhance performance,''
Yesalis said. ``Although, if you could get the proper dose of
creatine in the food supply, why would anybody pay for it? It will
cost you $40 to $50 a month.''
</P>
<P>
   Andro, on the other hand, is considered an anabolic steroid
because taken as a pill it raises the level of the male hormone
testosterone, and users claim it builds muscle mass and helps speed
recovery from sports-related injuries. Because it is still
available at many vitamin stores, mail-order businesses and
Internet suppliers, andro is not considered an illegal substance by
major league baseball or the NBA, which ban only illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the controversy surrounding McGwire's use of andro,
baseball commissioner Bud Selig and players union head Donald Fehr
have appointed a committee to study whether it should be banned,
but the committee has yet to reach a conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Andro, however, already has been banned by the International
Olympic Committee, the NCAA and the ATP tennis tour, and the NFL
has banned its use since 1996, primarily because it can be
classified with other steroids. While the method of taking the
steroid is far different from the injections athletes once used,
many experts believe the basic health repercussions are the same:
excessive acne, shrinkage of the testicles or uterus, and
potentially life-threatening ailments such as liver damage,
premature heart disease and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   While McGwire can set the home run record using andro, other
athletes haven't been so lucky. Gold medal shot-putter Randy
Barnes, the world-record holder, drew a lifetime ban last year for
testing positive for andro. And in September, Pittsburgh Steelers
offensive tackle Paul Wiggins was suspended for four games after
admitting he used the substance.
</P>
<P>
   Use of creatine, however, hasn't yet been banned by any sports
organization, although there is plenty of debate about its effects
and potential long-term health risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of our athletes have been using creatine for three years
or so,'' South Kitsap's Olsen said. ``It's not something we supply,
it's not something we tell our kids they have to be on. They go out
to their own people and do their own thing on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Creatine currently is the supplement of choice for body
building, primarily because it is not an anabolic steroid and
because so many athletes endorse its use.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Washington, strength and conditioning coach
Rick Huegli said creatine has been dispensed to many athletes under
his direct supervision, with little or no apparent ill effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It enhances the short-term burst energy system,'' Huegli said,
adding that most of the benefit comes during weightlifting
training, rather than in on-field performance.
</P>
<P>
   Huegli advises athletes to begin a program of better nutrition
and training without the use of supplements before trying anything
like creatine. But he says athletes will always be tempted to use
supplements because it ``helps them recover better and train longer
and harder.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Huegli said the UW would dispense a one-month
supply of creatine to any athlete who wanted to use it, but the
school has recently discontinued the practice for fear of liability
should an athlete develop a medical problem in the future. Athletes
now must buy their own supply.
</P>
<P>
   It's not hard to find young athletes who have used creatine. One
high school football player, Brian, of Mountlake Terrace, said he
began using the supplement last year in an attempt to build more
muscle mass and help him during offseason weight training. He
learned about creatine from other players who were using it on a
regular basis. But after experiencing some weight gain, he soon
decided that the expense wasn't worth the results he was seeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt that it was better to do it naturally,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another high school football player, a 17-year-old from Edmonds,
still uses creatine and says he grew from 167 pounds to 190 pounds
in about six months after using the supplement and increasing his
workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't work unless you also work harder, but it helps you
work harder,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The medical jury still is out on creatine, but it appears to be
far safer than an anabolic steroid or a product such as andro.
However, there are few studies on its effects on adolescents, and
none on long-term effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to separate fact from hype when it comes
to creatine,'' said Juhn of UW's sports medicine clinic. ``Creatine
has some potential, but people have this underlying assumption that
it works for everything, but it doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, it doesn't help sprinters or distance people in
track or swimming, said Juhn, who recently published a study on
potential side effects of creatine in the Clinical Journal of Sport
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Juhn says the weight gain associated with creatine is largely
due to water storage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big issue is, in the long-term, does creatine improve
strength? That's up for debate right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With concern being voiced by doctors such as Juhn, trainers like
Olsen are all the more wary of its potential for abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no long-term study done on creatine, so you have no
information from 10 years out,'' Olsen said.
</P>
<P>
   From the information he has seen, Olsen believes there are
several reasons to beware of the supplement: dehydration, possible
kidney problems and cost. He reports some young athletes spend
hundreds of dollars on the product with minimal results.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to andro or other steroids, creatine ``is probably the
least harmful, but in 10 years you might have some kid who took
three or four times the normal dose and find it was overworking the
kidneys or something like that,'' Olsen said. ``If you get a
symptom such as kidney failure 15 years down the road, how do you
relate that back to their creatine use?''
</P>
<P>
   There have been some benefits, Olsen said, noting some athletes
have gained 10 to 15 pounds in weight and muscle mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``But once they get off of it, they lose maybe half that
weight,'' he said. ``It takes so much water to digest that
protein.''
</P>
<P>
   Juhn notes that creatine is found not only in muscles, but in
the brain, the heart, the liver and testicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't really studied what taking oral levels of creatine
does to creatine levels elsewhere,'' he said. ``I'm saying we don't
know. ... For all we know, creatine might be the safest thing in
the world, but we haven't proven that.''
</P>
<P>
   Olsen says he doesn't know of any of his athletes who are
currently taking andro, but he's convinced that many kids are
trying it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bet if you talk to kids, most would say they're not scared
by it,'' he said. ``It's the idea, would you trade a gold medal if
you could only live five years? Yeah, give me the gold medal.''
</P>
<P>
   Yesalis believes there will always be some new product on the
market that will attract athletes. One is human growth hormone,
which is used as an ergogenic supplement by body builders and has
such a short half-life it is nearly impossible to detect by
standard drug-testing methods.
</P>
<P>
   Yesalis contends that many athletes who use creatine or andro do
so to mask their hidden use of human growth hormone to build even
bigger bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some athletes have been using creatine and andro as a
smokescreen for their use of other more potent supplements,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   With so many athletes using such products, there might be no way
to turn back the tide short of drug testing at every level of
athletics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disturbed by the emphasis put on supplements when we
should be thinking about the most proven method of enhancing
athletic performance, which is dedication, perseverance, hard work
and practice,'' Juhn said. ``It's really discouraging, what's
happening now.''

NEW INTERNET RETAIL TIE BOOSTS MATTHEW SHARES
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Stock of Matthews Studio Equipment Group received
a jolt, rising as much as 54 &UR;  &LR; percent after the rental-equipment
specialist announced an affiliation with Internet retail giant
Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   The stock jumped as high as $7.125 Monday before falling back to
$5 for a gain of 37.5 cents, or 8 percent, during the session. More
than 936,000 shares changed hands, 18 times the average volume
during the past month.
</P>
<P>
   The stock price has more than doubled since late December, when
Matthews announced strong quarterly results with revenues up 19
percent to $17.8 million. It hit $5.125 on Jan. 13 after the
company announced plans for full launch of ShowbizMart.com this
spring as a one-stop resource for suppliers, crew and equipment,
then fell back to less than $5 as Internet fever cooled.
</P>
<P>
   The chief executive officer of Burbank-based Matthews said the
affiliation will make it easy for ShowbizMart.com customers to buy
Amazon.com's books, videos, CDs and other merchandise.
ShowbizMart.com will earn referral fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This exciting new association with Amazon.com will allow
ShowbizMart.com to further its goal of becoming the entertainment
industry's true single resource for industry insiders as well as
consumers and collectors of show business-related items and
merchandise,'' said Carlos D. DeMattos, chairman and chief
executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, Matthews has been buying rivals to become the
industry's leader in rental equipment, and it has grown from three
locations with 150 employees to 14 sites with 300. It recently sold
off its manufacturing subsidiary.

POLL OF FRESHMEN SHOWS COLLEGE STUDENTS SHUN POLITICS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY SHARLINE CHIANG  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Nationwide, college freshmen are losing interest
in political issues, are less likely to choose law as a career and
less engaged in academics, according to an annual UCLA study of 469
colleges released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also shows students are volunteering more,
increasingly opposed to abortion and casual sex, and drinking less
beer.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say the lack of political interest may be fueled by
the political turmoil in the wake of the Lewinsky-Clinton scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tell us that the issues aren't relevant to their lives,''
said Linda Sax, survey director. ``The issues of 30 years ago _ the
draft, the civil rights movement _ these were things that the
students could grasp onto.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was conducted in the fall of 1998 by the Higher
Education Research Institute at the University of California, Los
Angeles' Graduate School of Education and Information Studies. Data
was gleaned from two- and four-year colleges across America.
</P>
<P>
   A record-low 25.9 percent of freshmen said ``keeping up to date
with political affairs'' was very important, compared to 26.7
percent in 1997 and a high of 57.8 percent in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles college students found results pretty much on
target.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some students say they're not getting involved in politics
because they probably feel that this is something that we don't
really have a voice in,'' said Tameika Hall, 23, a junior and deaf
studies major at California State University, Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said students opt to volunteer at the community level
because they can see the difference they're making. Also, many high
schools and junior highs now require students to get involved.
</P>
<P>
   The UCLA survey shows a record number of freshmen _ 74.2 percent
_ compared with 73.1 percent in 1997 and a low of 62 percent in
1989 _ report volunteering in their last year of high school.
Researchers lament another finding, however _ of those that have
volunteered, only 18.9 percent said they expect to continue in
college.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteerism aside, making money still matters, students said.
</P>
<P>
   Some 74 percent said being ``well off financially'' is very
important, compared to 44 percent in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would definitely agree with that. I think that's mainly
because the people who went to the college in the '60s were
idealists and these in the '90s are realists,'' said UCLA freshman
Thomas Soteros-McNamara, 18, a political science major. ``Society
reinforces that the haves and have-nots (are separated) by higher
education. Students realize their livelihood and future relies on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other findings showed:
</P>
<P>
   --An all-time high 60.3 percent of students said they ``came
late to class'' frequently or occasionally compared to a low of
49.2 percent in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   --A record-low 3 percent of students aspire to be lawyers,
compared to a high of 5.4 percent in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   --A record-low 51.6 percent said they drink beer frequently or
occasionally, compared with a high of 75.2 in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   --A record low of 50.9 percent said they support the
legalization of abortion, compared to 53.5 percent in 1997 and 64.9
percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   --A record low of 39.6 percent of freshmen said they agreed ``if
two people really like each other, it's all right for them to have
sex even if they've known each other for a very short time.'' In
1987, students responded positively at a rate of 51.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   --Responding to the survey's first questions on computer usage,
about 83 percent said they use the Internet for research or
homework.

BEST PREPS IN THE WEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With 36 players from four states, the 1999 edition of the annual
Best in the West football team, compiled by the Long Beach
Press-Telegram, is the third largest in the 23 years of the team.
</P>
<P>
   And it is the deepest.
</P>
<P>
   Not only because of the exceptional talent in this class or the
record five players from one high school but because no team in BIW
history has had such a high concentration of votes as this one.
</P>
<P>
   There were more players on the teams in 1988 (38) and 1993 (37),
but the standards for making the first team weren't as high as they
are today.
</P>
<P>
   The Best in the West team is determined by votes from 10 college
head coaches and recruiting coordinators. Until 1994, it took only
six votes to make the first team. Beginning with the '94 team, it
took seven votes to make the first team.
</P>
<P>
   Where eliminating the players with six votes from the teams in
'88 and '93 would reduce those lists to 23 players, adding those
with six votes this year would swell the '99 team to an amazing 46
players. Thus, the deepest group of prospects yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids who are good this year are very good,'' said Dick
Lascola of the Scouting Evaluation Association. ``They are as good
as any year. But once you get through the first wave, it gets
really thin.''
</P>
<P>
   To receive a vote, the panel must believe the player will make
an impact by his sophomore year in college. If the panel is correct
_ and it is more often than not _ get used to hearing these names.
</P>
<P>
   There are four unanimous choices (10 votes each): tight end Mike
Seidman of Westlake, receiver Kareem Kelly of Long Beach Poly,
defensive lineman Bernard Riley of Los Alamitos and running back
Paul Arnold of Burien (Wash.) Kennedy. Last year, there were eight
10s but only 20 players on the first team.
</P>
<P>
   A record five players _ Kelly, quarterback Chris Lewis, running
back Larry Croom, receiver Samie Parker and cornerback Darrell
Rideaux _ are from Long Beach Poly. The old standard was also held
by Poly, when Mark Carrier, Stacy Elliot, Brian Tuliau and Chris
Roscoe made the team in 1986. This year's Poly contingent, by the
way, would have grown to six if linebacker Dennis Link's six votes
were enough to earn first-team honors.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good year for teammates as, in addition to Poly, Los
Alamitos placed three on the team (Riley, Sagan Atuatasi, Keenan
Howry) and Westchester (Charles Drake, Courtney Morgan) and Hart
(Kyle Boller, Jerry Owens) two each.
</P>
<P>
   The overall 1999 first team is comprised of seven offensive
linemen, five running backs, five receivers, two tight ends, four
quarterbacks, three defensive linemen, three linebackers, three
defensive backs, a receiver-defensive back, a running
back-defensive back, a fullback-linebacker and even a player (Shaun
McDonald of Phoenix Shadow Mountain) who specializes in returning
kicks. Thirty-one players are from California, two each from Oregon
and Washington and one from Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The four prime prospects, according to the votes, are Arnold,
Kelly, Riley and Seidman.
</P>
<P>
   Seidman, a tight end already with NFL size, has yet to decide on
where he will play college, but he has the list sliced to UCLA and
USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``He literally could have gone to any school in the country,''
said Westlake coach Jim Benkert of his 6-foot-5, 245-pound star.
``Colleges love it that he's a big guy but still has the speed to

</P>
<P>
   Arnold is considered by some longtime Seattle observers as
possibly the best prep running back in Washington history. The
speedy 6-foot-1, 205-pounder, who is choosing between the hometown
Huskies, Notre Dame and UCLA, became coach Rick Neuheisel's first
priority when he took over at the University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Riley is 6-foot-2, 300 pounds but has run a 4.9 40-yard dash.
Kelly is the defending state 200-meter champion.
</P>
<P>
   But this team is much more than the four unanimous choices.
</P>
<P>
   There are four outstanding quarterbacks (Lewis, Boller, Venice's
J.P. Losman, and Orinda Miramonte's Ken Dorsey), tremendous skill
players (Charter Oak receiver Steve Stevenson, Hart's Owens,
Monrovia running back Akil Harris, St. Paul receiver/defensive back
Marcell Allmond) and plenty of depth throughout. &QL;

ATTORNEY GENERAL WON'T REVIEW POLICY ON LAWMAKERS' PER DIEM PAY. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS MOESER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The Arizona Attorney General's Office has refused to
review a House policy that gave a former state House speaker
thousands of dollars in a daily allowance even though he was no
longer eligible for the extra money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a legislative branch issue that the legislative
branch needs to look at, rather than the executive branch,'' said
Tim Delaney, Attorney General Janet Napolitano's chief deputy.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Napolitano's own ruling, requested by House Speaker
Jeff Groscost and Senate President Brenda Burns, that allowed
legislators to continue to collect thousands of dollars in daily
allowances that voters had rejected at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, voters approved Proposition 302 by a 56 percent
to 44 percent margin. It increased legislative pay to $24,000 but
reduced per diem payments.
</P>
<P>
   The question was put on the ballot by the Commission on Salaries
for Elected State Officers. In her Jan. 7 ruling, Napolitano said
the commission had no authority to tinker with the daily allowance
for expenses, only salaries. The Attorney General's Office
intervened to rule on that constitution question, a representative
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   That ruling meant lawmakers were able to keep the $9,000 raise
and still have access to the old per diem system, which paid some
lawmakers as much as an additional $20,000 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Napolitano argued in her opinion that lawmakers were eligible to
take both the pay raise and per diem because the publicity pamphlet
for Proposition 302 ``focused exclusively on the salary increase,
not the per diem limitation.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to that opinion, the pamphlet stated twice within the
first 20 lines that Proposition 302 would change per diem
reimbursement as well as increase lawmakers' salaries.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Phoenix attorney Barry Dale said he will challenge
Napolitano's ruling in a lawsuit to be filed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In a Jan. 22 letter, Dale urged Napolitano to reconsider her
decision. He said he would seek to recover the money ``illegally
paid to the legislators,'' plus 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they would find it upsetting to be named in a lawsuit
due to their acceptance of monies in reliance on your erroneous
opinion,'' Dale wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate indignity, Dale said, ``is having a ballot
proposition overruled by the attorney general. It takes away the
rights from the voters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arizona Republic'' reported Sunday that former Rep. Don
Aldridge was able to collect thousands of dollars in extra per diem
money even though he had lost his leadership post and was no longer
eligible for the money.
</P>
<P>
   Those extra days account for $5,160 of the $13,080 Aldridge
collected in per diem payments. He also received $6,438 for mileage
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   On some days, even when the Legislature was not in session,
Aldridge signed for his $60 in per diem pay, then went home,
according to House sources.
</P>
<P>
   Through a ``special dispensation'' from Groscost, Aldridge was
able to collect more money than any other member of the House.
</P>
<P>
   And there were other discrepancies in the House policy. Rep.
Debra Brimhall, R-Snowflake, was allowed to claim mileage when she
traveled her district while other members, like Rep. John Verkamp,
R-Flagstaff, were not.
</P>
<P>
   During the Legislative session, Maricopa County legislators
receive $35 a day, while legislators from other counties get a $60
allowance.
</P>
<P>
   When the Legislature is out of session, House and Senate members
are eligible for a day a week of per diem pay, plus the days they
attend committee meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative leaders qualify for additional money because they
generally have to spend more time at the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Senate leaders qualify for six days of per diem payments each
two-week period, while House leaders can get the money anytime they
work at the Capitol. &QL;

MEDIA FIRM JOINS IN AD SITE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The parent of the &UR;  &LR; Los Angeles Daily News and other Los
Angeles Newspaper Group newspapers led a consortium of media
companies Monday that bought AdOne Classified Network Inc. to
create the nation's largest locally based Web site for classified
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Denver-based MediaNews Group Inc. already owned a 25 percent
stake in AdOne and the deal, reached Wednesday, creates a privately
held company that will be called AdOne L.L.C.
</P>
<P>
   AdOne and its Web site, classifiedwarehouse.com, will be
co-owned by E.W. Scripps Co., Advance Publications Inc., Donrey
Media Group, Hearst Corp. and Garden State Newspapers, an affiliate
of MediaNews. The ownership group includes four of the 10 largest
U.S. newspaper companies. Terms were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Classifiedwarehouse.com is the Internet's most comprehensive
collection of classified advertising. The ads _ which will come
from the chain's newspapers _ will be distributed on Lycos Inc.'s
main Web site, lycos.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have long been believers in AdOne's classified network. But
with the new support of our strategic partners and the provision of
a significant amount of new content on the network, AdOne will be
clearly positioned as the premier provider of online classified
advertising content,'' said William Dean Singleton, president and
chief executive officer of MediaNews Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first and foremost responsibility is to our local
classified advertising customers and our local newspapers have
served their needs well for decades. Now, in addition to
distribution in our local newspapers, our customers will benefit
significantly from the strength of the AdOne network through the
tremendous distribution capabilities of AdOne's ... consumer
site,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Classifiedwarehouse.com's searchable advertising database
averages more than 3 million new ads per month and is expected to
grow to more than 6 million ads by the summer, said Dan Manco,
AdOne's marketing director.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers who can't find a product or service through their
local paper's Web site will be able to conduct a broader search via
classifiedwarehouse.com, he said.
</P>
<P>
   MediaNews Group is the seventh-largest newspaper company in the
United States. It manages newspaper companies with combined daily
and Sunday circulation of approximately 1.55 million and 1.68
million, respectively. In addition to the Daily News, its Los
Angeles-area holdings include the Long Beach Press Telegram, San
Gabriel Valley Tribune, Pasadena Star-News and Whittier Daily News.

ENJOY SUPER BOWL FROM COMFORTS OF HOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOMMY CUMMINGS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
FORT WORTH, Tex. _ To enjoy the atmosphere of Super Bowl XXXIII,
you don't have to be in balmy Miami, Fla., soaking up the ocean
spray in a rented sports car while speeding down Biscayne
Boulevard.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Heck, simply pull up a seat in the den, boot up the computer and
watch it unfold on the 'Net.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of big-media sites give Super Bowl XXXIII a big presence
online. These resource-rich sites all have the components of a
quality site: updated content, easy navigation and interactivity.
</P>
<P>
   And they all have unique features.
</P>
<P>
   Here is one Web surfer's guide to the best of the Super Bowl
sites:
</P>
<P>
   Best preview: CBS SportsLine
(www.sportsline.com/u/football/nfl/superbowl/xxxiii) has lots of
cool features that the other sites have, but none has EA SPORTS'
video-game simulation of this year's Super Bowl. Using Madden NFL
'99, the Denver Broncos won, but not before the Atlanta Falcons
bolted to a 22-0 lead. CBS SportsLine has a breakdown of the
simulated game, complete with still images and statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Best editorial content: CNN/SI
(cnnsi.com/football/nfl/1998/playoffs) taps the resources of Sports
Illustrated and CNN correspondents. If you like to read, this is
the place to go. And if you like the magazine's dynamic photos, the
site has a high-resolution image gallery loaded with Super
Bowl-related photos. Users can zoom into the images _ as if they
have an online magnifying glass _ for closer looks.
</P>
<P>
   Best fantasy games: ESPN.com
(espn.go.com/nfl/playoffs98/superbowl) gets fantasy football
enthusiasts back online with its Fantasy Super Bowl Tournament and
Super Bowl Over/Under features.
</P>
<P>
   For the tournament, ESPN.com editors selected an all-time roster
for each franchise from all the players who ever wore its uniform
in a Super Bowl. Eight teams were seeded based on their Super Bowl
records. The San Francisco 49ers, who are 5-0 in Super Bowls, are
the No. 1 seed and the Cowboys, 5-3, the No. 2 seed. Votes cast by
ESPN.com users will decide a champion this week. It's a good way
for Cowboys fans to make some noise during Super Bowl week.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN.com's Over/Under is a free mini-fantasy game in which users
guess the frequency with which certain activities occur during the
game. Example: What quarter will be the first Dirty Bird dance
happen? Winner gets a TV.
</P>
<P>
   Best interaction: Superbowl.com (actually, superbowl.lycos.com)
has QB1, where online players test their play-calling skills during
the Super Bowl. Players must guess the offensive play and result
before each snap. Winners earn tickets to next year's Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Best video/audio: Since most are sitting at home this season,
Cowboys fans yearning for a little nostalgia will love NFL.com's
Super Bowl section (www.nfl.com/sb33), which has video and audio of
memorable moments from past Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Best polls: ESPN.com will be polling online visitors after the
game about their favorite and least-favorite Super Bowl
commercials. For the sake of some imagination, let's get those
Budweiser lizards out of here, please.
</P>
<P>
   Best place to learn how to do the Dirty Bird: Jamal Anderson's
site on America Online (keyword: jamal) has step-by-step
instructions. The Falcons running back also relates his theory on
the Dirty Bird on his site, which hawks official Dirty Bird
merchandise at a 10-percent discount this week.
</P>
<P>
   Best chamber-of-commerce-like site: SoFla.com's Super Bowl site
(www.sofla.com/FEATURES/superbowl) has it all: where to stay, where
to eat, where to celebrate, etc. It also has tips on where to rent
a car _ in case you decide to go to Miami and not sit in the den
and call up Web sites.

TCU'S ANGER PROBLEM NOT LIMITED TO NAILON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
It was almost exactly a year ago, give or take a couple of weeks,
that talented TCU center Lee Nailon was ordered to undergo anger
counseling after a one-sided fight with his girlfriend in his
campus dorm room.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yesterday, the Western Athletic Conference decided to give him a
24-hour refresher course.
</P>
<P>
   Nailon was handed a one-game suspension, taking him out of
uniform for TCU's 72-62 loss at Tulsa last night.
</P>
<P>
   It was exactly the right thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   You probably won't get head coach Billy Tubbs to admit that. He
spent much of the afternoon trying to convince WAC supervisor of
officials Bobby Dibler that a suspension wasn't merited, which,
from Dibler's point of view, must have been like being locked in a
room with a hyperventilating used-car salesman.
</P>
<P>
   But what's a head coach supposed to do when his star player's
availability for a key conference game is on the line?
</P>
<P>
   The question, in fact, wasn't so much whether Nailon deserved a
suspension, which is the NCAA-mandated penalty automatically meted
out to players who have been ejected for fighting. The real debate
is whether Tubbs deserves one, too.
</P>
<P>
   He probably does.
</P>
<P>
   Brash Billy made a crass bully of himself again once he lost
Nailon just 34 seconds into Saturday night's home game with
Nevada-Las Vegas. Tubbs must have known what was coming.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a heroic effort from Marquise Gainous, who scored 41
points, the Frogs lost in overtime to the Runnin' Rebels, who took
advantage of TCU's many defensive lapses.
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs spent the game on his feet, spewing venom any time a
hapless official was forced into earshot. After the game, referee
Bill Gracey reported that Tubbs came to the officials' dressing
room, cursed at them and kicked the door.
</P>
<P>
   Not our Saint Billy, surely. Brother Bill was probably just
checking on the officials' postgame buffet and was perhaps mildly
upset that the roast duck was a tad cold or the caviar too salty.
He may have kicked the door as a way of calling the chef's
attention to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Billy throw a tantrum? Why, what a preposterous suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   Around here, we just call that personality and try to slip decaf
into his coffee cup whenever possible.
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs had apparently hoped to convince Dibler that Nailon's
reaction when UNLV guard Mark Dickel _ about half Nailon's size _
tried to rip the ball out of his hands while Nailon was standing
out of bounds with the clock stopped should be expected. Nailon
basically fired an open-handed hook to the side of Dickel's face.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, if I'd been Nailon, already irritated and frustrated at
being pushed out of bounds by muscular UNLV center Kasbars Kambala
(now there's the match I'd pay to see), that might have been my
instant reaction, too. Dickel had no business trying to snatch the
ball away. The referee has to handle the ball after that call.
</P>
<P>
   The only reason there wasn't a fight, however, was because
Dickel didn't swing back, which saved him from being tossed, too,
and most of the other players missed the exchange because they were
already on their way to the opposite end of the court.
</P>
<P>
   To Nailon's credit, he has spent much of this season holding his
temper in check while being double-teamed, fouled, hacked and
mangled. Opponents have done about everything but clip his toenails
for him.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, he becomes an open target for anyone trying to
bait him. If he's ejected for fighting, even in self-defense, again
this season, he'll face another NCAA-mandated suspension _ this
time for the rest of the year, including the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, without Nailon, TCU can forget about the NCAA
Tournament anyway.
</P>
<P>
   One more fight of any kind and he's gone.
</P>
<P>
   At least Nailon hasn't bitten anybody's ear off yet.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad we can't say the same _ figuratively speaking, of course
_ for Tubbs.

TOP QUARTERBACK PICKS TEXAS OVER TENNESSEE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN MILLER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
FORT WORTH, Tex. _ A week ago, Texas lost the recruiting battle for
Duncanville defensive end Kevin Young when he withdrew his
commitment from the Longhorns and committed to Tennessee.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Longhorns paid the Volunteers back in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Chris Simms from Ramapo High School in Franklin
Lakes, N.J., withdrew his commitment from Tennessee and committed
to Texas, his mother, Diana Simms, and his high school coach, Mike
Miello, confirmed yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is he had some time to think about it,''
Miello said. ``After doing so, he felt like Texas was a much better
fit for him. He liked everything about the coaches and players and
he came to a point where he wanted to change his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Simms, the son of former NFL quarterback Phil Simms, was
unavailable for comment yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-5, 210-pound Chris Simms is regarded by many as the
top quarterback prospect in the country. He is the second highly
touted recruit to commit to the Longhorns in less than a week.
Galena Park North Shore linebacker Cory Redding committed to Texas
on Thursday. Eight members of the Star-Telegram's National Top 100
recruits have committed to the Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was a possibility after getting a commitment
from Redding, Texas might end up with the No. 1 class in the
country,'' said Bobby Burton, editor-in-chief of The National
Recruiting Advisor. ``Now, with the addition of Simms, it does not
make them just a contender; it makes them the leader. They are the
team to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   During his four years at Ramapo, Simms played in every game and
broke every passing record at the high school. He completed 381 of
640 passes for 7,055 yards with 63 touchdowns and 13 interceptions.
He also ran for 324 yards and four touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Simms originally announced his decision to commit to Tennessee
on Dec. 15, then picking the Volunteers over Texas and Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   Commitments are not binding. Signing day is Feb. 3.

MAVERICKS SIGN NASH TO A SIX-YEAR DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
DALLAS _ For the fourth time in three years, the Mavericks have put
the ball in the hands of a new ``cornerstone point guard of the
future.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest candidate _ despite having only 11 NBA starts on his
resume _ could have an All-Star career. His assistant coach says
he'll have the same positive effect on games as Phoenix Suns star
and former Mavericks standout Jason Kidd. And his head coach
compares him favorably to a young John Stockton, the Utah Jazz's
future Hall-of-Famer.
</P>
<P>
   Psst, meet Steve Nash, one of the NBA's best-kept secrets, the
owner of a new six-year contract extension worth $36 million, and
the new owner of a Mavericks leadership burden that proved too
cumbersome for Kidd and Sam Cassell in 1996-97, and Robert Pack in
'97-98.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand fans have questions about me or there are some
saying `Who is this guy?' and that's okay,'' said Nash, who
yesterday was named co-captain along with Michael Finley and signed
the extension that will begin paying him $4 million next season.
``I'm not promising I'll make the All-Star team because that can be
political. But if I'm not playing at an All-Star level in three
years, come to me because there won't be anybody else to blame.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, yes there will.
</P>
<P>
   Though it was general manager Don Nelson who pulled the trigger
on the draft-day acquisition of Nash from the Suns for the
Mavericks' 1999 first-round draft pick, it's assistant Donnie
Nelson who admits to holding the gun. Donnie Nelson says that while
he was a Suns assistant he struggled to muzzle his enthusiasm about
a third-team guard as he watched Nash outplay Kidd and Kevin
Johnson daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may sound crazy to a lot of people because Steve's still
relatively unknown, but in a different way he'll be just as
effective as Jason,'' Donnie Nelson said. ``He's like Jason, though
a little more under control. My rear end's on the line with this
one, and I'm very comfortable with that. This is just finally time
for Steve. He's paid his dues, and he's ready to break out.''
</P>
<P>
   Armed with the new contract that will team him with Finley for
at least the next three seasons and the pressure of being a
co-captain, Nash's time in the spotlight has arrived. The 15th pick
by Phoenix in the '96 draft, Nash has played in relative obscurity
behind Kidd and Johnson the past two seasons. In 141 career games,
he has averaged nine points and three assists. In 76 games under
coach Danny Ainge last season, Nash was used in up-tempo,
three-guard sets and as a defensive stopper on opposing point
guards, like Avery Johnson of the San Antonio Spurs in last
spring's playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are going to learn who he is, and they're
going to like what they see,'' Nelson said. ``He can shoot, he's
hard-nosed and he's a winner. I'd compare him to a Stockton when he
was younger, but Steve is much more aggressive as a shooter and a
scorer. With a guy like him there's no risk unless there's an
injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Stockton arrived in the NBA from tiny Gonzaga to become the
NBA's all-time leader in assists and steals. Nash, 24, played at
Santa Clara and does have a reputation around the league for taking
charges and key shots late in the game, and playing bigger than his
6-foot-3, 195-pound frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a little chance here because he's so young, but it's a
good risk,'' said Finley, who signed a similar extension worth $42
million over five years in October 1997. ``We're doing the same
thing Utah did with Stockton and Cleveland did with \RKevin\S
Johnson. As far as leadership and respect, Steve's already probably
the most responsible guy on the team.''

FALCONS' 1-2 PUNCH TESTS BRONCOS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
MIAMI _ When the Atlanta Falcons upset the Minnesota Vikings in the
NFC Championship Game on Jan. 17, that didn't leave the league's
most prolific receiving duo in terms of yards per catch out of the
Super Bowl.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Minnesota's Randy Moss and Cris Carter, are in fact, second in
that category.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's T-N-T combo of Terance Mathis and Tony Martin is
first.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis and Martin combined to average a league-high 17.82 yards
per catch and to score 17 touchdowns in the regular season. Before
the playoffs, Mathis had 19 receptions of 20 yards or longer,
including five of 49 yards or longer. Martin had 16 receptions of
20 yards or longer, four receptions of 40 yards or longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are very surprised about us,'' Mathis said.
``When the magazines came out, the media makes all of their
superstars before the games are played.''
</P>
<P>
   Charged with stopping the Falcons' superstars are Broncos
cornerbacks Ray Crockett and Darrien Gordon. Crockett is better in
man-to-man coverage than Gordon and will probably be locked up on
Mathis for much of the game. However, both have shown an ability to
make plays. Each returned an interception for a touchdown during
the regular season. And Gordon had two interceptions against the
Jets in the AFC Championship Game. Nickle cornerback Darrius
Johnson also has three interceptions for the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   The key for the Broncos will be to mix up their coverages, and
disguise blitz packages against Falcons quarterback Chris Chandler
so that he won't have time to look to his second, third, and fourth
wide receivers. Chandler said the Broncos do that as well as any
team in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're real experienced on defense,'' Chandler said. ``They
do a nice mixture of playing you straight up, all-out blitz, the
zone blitz, the tricky stuff. They mix it up as well as anybody.''

FALCONS HEAR A `PROPHET'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
MIAMI _ They will crowd around Falcons safety Eugene Robinson all
week here at the Super Bowl as if he were preaching gospel.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And to his teammates he is. The Falcons have followed the word
the 35-year-old Robinson is spreading, whether it be advice on
religion, family life or defensive schemes.
</P>
<P>
   They know that listening to the 14-year-veteran, who signed with
the Falcons as a free-agent in the off-season after two years with
the Packers, has brought them to this promised land.
</P>
<P>
   ``He talks non-stop,'' safety Randy Fuller said. ``And you want
to listen carefully, because if you don't you probably will miss
something important. He is our spiritual leader and everyone
gravitates toward him.''
</P>
<P>
   Said linebacker Jessie Tuggle: ``The minute I met Gene, I knew
he was a leader. He has that glow and magic about him. He talks
constantly, has endless energy and gives guys advice on everything
from zone coverages to family life to movie reviews.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicknamed ``the Prophet'' by his teammates, Robinson simply
says, ``I'm real vocal. I'm always in their ears, always in their
ears.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Robinson is making his third consecutive trip the Super
Bowl _ he was there with the Packers the past two years _ his
teammates are bracing for an earful this week in preparation for
Sunday's battle against the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, he brought along a visual aid _ his 1996
Super Bowl ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to make it tangible for the other guys,'' Robinson
said. ``A lot of guys look at the ring and want to put it on and
look at it up close. I tell them that we can have our own rings. We
can do this. I try to make it real for them and not be mesmerized
by the Super Bowl. We can go out there and win a football game and
get our own rings.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, however, has done more than talk. He started every
game for the Falcons, recording 94 tackles and four interceptions.
He has been even better in the playoffs. He sparked the divisional
playoff victory against the 49ers with a 77-yard interception
return and helped contain the Vikings' big-play offense with a key
deflection against receiver Randy Moss in the NFC championship
game.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons coach Dan Reeves, who acquired Robinson in the
off-season to bring leadership and playmaking ability to the
secondary, said the crafty veteran has been everything he hoped for
and more.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a take-charge kind of guy who is willing to stick his
neck out,'' Reeves said. ``He loves responsibility. The more
responsibility, the better. He is a vocal leader who has been a
great addition and inspiration for this team.''

COACHES CROSS THE GOLD LINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
FORT WORTH, Tex. _ College football's Millionaire Coaches Club
doubled in membership during the past month, making ``salary
inflation'' a hot topic among smiling coaches and frowning athletic
directors.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Florida's Steve Spurrier (estimated salary: $2 million) and
Florida State's Bobby Bowden (estimated salary: $1 million) have
been joined by Tennessee's Phillip Fulmer and Washington's Rick
Neuheisel. Both have million-dollar deals; Fulmer's contract was
renegotiated, and Neuheisel made his money by leaving Colorado for
his new job.
</P>
<P>
   TCU's Dennis Franchione, meanwhile, had his contract reworked,
going from around $450,000 a year to $800,000.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a bottom line to these salary bottom lines, it's
this: If you want to win, you have to pay. The best coaches _ or
the ones perceived as the best coaches _ get paid for their
expertise. And those athletic directors who can pay, often do.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this: In 1982, Texas A&AMP;M hired Jackie Sherrill to
resurrect its football program. Sherrill's contract was a shocking
$240,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska athletic director Bill Byrne calls the upwardly mobile
salaries ``madness.'' He pointed out that most athletic departments
are operating in the red.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, an NCAA study of revenues and expenses released in
October indicated that Division I-A average expenses increased 21
percent from 1995 to 1997 while average revenues increased 15
percent over the two-year period. ``There just seems to be more
money than good sense on some of these issues,'' Byrne said.
</P>
<P>
   At least 17 I-A schools will have new coaches for the 1999
season. Last season, that number was 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think schools are understanding that coaches make a big
difference,'' Texas athletic director DeLoss Dodds said. ``As one
school pays more, it starts a domino effect that impacts everybody.
Schools that are generating revenue can pay the big salaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington, for instance, reported an athletic department profit
of approximately $6.6 million for 1998 with about $10 million more
in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Franchione turned the Horned Frogs around from a 1-10 season in
1997 to a 7-5 record in 1998 that included a Sun Bowl victory
against Southern California. To fend off schools with coaching
openings, TCU reworked his contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these salary increases, they're market driven,''
Franchione said. ``The standard gets set by what people are willing
to pay. And for coaches, contracts like these provide some
insurance. It's a short distance from the penthouse to the
outhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel was earning $635,000 a year at Colorado. Gary Barnett,
Neuheisel's successor at Colorado, saw his salary rise over 50
percent. He was earning an estimated $460,000 a year at
Northwestern and accepted Colorado's offer of $710,000.
</P>
<P>
   In recommending Barnett's deal to the Colorado board of regents,
school chancellor Richard L. Byyny said Barnett's compensation was
``necessary . . . in light of the prevailing market conditions and
competitive employment practices nationwide for head football
coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma is paying a reported $775,000 a year for the next five
years to Bob Stoops, a first-time head coach at the Division I-A
level.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a line between sensible and irrational, and I felt
comfortable that I was operating with a clear understanding of the
marketplace,'' Oklahoma athletic director Joe Castiglione said.
``But I do have concerns as the packages start to escalate. You're
constantly asking yourself, `What are the resources available to us
to fulfill our \Rcontractual\S obligations?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Salary escalation has been particularly evident in the
Pacific-10 Conference. In 1995, Stanford hired Tyrone Willingham at
a reported $500,000 a year. Last year, Southern California topped
that by paying Paul Hackett $640,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes Neuheisel's million-dollar deal shortly after Arizona
State reworked Bruce Snyder's deal to $700,000 and Arizona upped
Dick Tomey's contract to $500,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Pac-10 assistant commissioner Jim Muldoon says that the
conference doesn't keep track of coaching contracts, but his guess
is that five years ago, the average salary for Pac-10 football
coaches was $200,000. For 1999, that average is expected to be
approximately $545,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if the bar was raised, but certainly a few
eyebrows were raised,'' Oregon athletic director Bill Moos said of
Washington's big-money deal with Neuheisel. ``If you're hiring a
coach now, you have to pay attention to what's going on at places
like Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Scholarship restrictions have spread the talent and made more
programs competitive. Now there is concern that the playing field
is being tilted by coaching salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to lie and say it's easy for us to be a player
in this type of game,'' said Oregon State athletic director Mitch
Barnhart, who signed new coach Dennis Erickson to a
$300,000-a-year-deal. ``But we'll pay market value, whatever that
is.''

COWBOYS ASSISTANTS GET NO NFL RESPECT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
FORT WORTH, Tex. _ I'm still asking. Somebody tell me. Please. In
the new world order of football coaching, how did it happen that
TCU's Dennis Franchione is now better paid than the head coach of
the Cowboys?
<TEXT>
<P>
   And for anyone coming up with that answer, don't stop there. Get
right to work on this stumper:
</P>
<P>
   Why did the NFL fill a record nine head coaching vacancies over
the past month, and not one Cowboys' assistant even receive a
courtesy phone call inquiring about possible interest?
</P>
<P>
   Let's see _ figure nine teams looking for a head coach, and each
had around five candidates. Even with overlaps, there had to be 30
names on those interview lists.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Valley Ranch had the same number of head
coaching interviews as Linda Tripp does new best friends.
</P>
<P>
   What does this tell us?
</P>
<P>
   If you say it's a weak staff, I'd say wrong. It's not.
</P>
<P>
   But in trying to gauge how far the Cowboys have fallen in
league-wide prestige, this is about as good a measuring stick as
you'll find.
</P>
<P>
   The cycle comes and goes. At the moment, it's gone at Valley
Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   How is Green Bay's quarterback coach _ somebody named Andy Reid
_ hired at Philadelphia? OK, idiots are in charge at Philadelphia.
But still.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for instance, Dave Campo, who has put in 10 quality
seasons as an NFL and Cowboys assistant, the past four in total
charge of an overachieving defense.
</P>
<P>
   Everything the Cowboys have done defensively in that span, which
has always been more than expected, is a credit to Campo. The
previous head coach had nothing to offer, and when Chan Gailey took
over he made it clear he would be totally consumed with offense.
</P>
<P>
   At least on the defensive side of the ball, Campo has been an
NFL head coach for four years, and with great results. But nine
vacancies this off-season, and not even a telephone call. Don't
tell me Dave Campo hasn't been more involved with winning football
games in the NFL than an Andy Reid.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the ``offensive trend'' in the league, it doesn't make
sense. That was the defensive coordinator of the Jaguars, Dick
Jauron, who was hired last weekend by the Bears. Then again, based
on how Bears' management handled the search, Campo came out ahead
not being involved.
</P>
<P>
   Another defensive coordinator, Arizona's Dave McGinnis, was
announced as the head coach on Friday, except it was before he had
agreed to the terms. McGinnis ended up walking away, and good for
him.
</P>
<P>
   Go back a year ago, and Jerry Jones' coaching search looks
totally organized compared to the Bears.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nine new coaches, four are defensive guys. But George
Seifert went to Carolina on track record, and rightfully so. Plus,
Ray Rhodes had a Green Bay background, while Kansas City stayed at
home in promoting defensive coordinator Gunther Cunningham. But
Jauron? Well, Jacksonville is simply an organization that has
passed up the Cowboys in prestige. The Jaguars' offensive
coordinator, Chris Palmer, got the Cleveland job. ``Two very, very
good men and coaches, right there,'' Campo said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't that long ago when the Cowboys had three assistants
hired as head coaches within two years _ Dave Wannstedt in Chicago,
Norv Turner in Washington and Butch Davis at the University of
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   These days, however, the phone lines are down. And while Campo
should have been a leading candidate somewhere, it's also
surprising the snub extends to special teams' coach Joe Avezzano,
assistant head coach/defensive line coach Jim Bates, and offensive
line coach Hudson Houck. All have qualifications.
</P>
<P>
   For Campo, the long-standing inside joke, even with him, is he
doesn't ``look'' the head coaching part. But it may not be a joke
to NFL owners.
</P>
<P>
   In a crowd, Campo could be your favorite computer technician. Or
a former shortstop, which he once was in college, and a good one,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very handsome, but I'm short,'' Campo said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, what is the ``look'' of a head coach in the NFL?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say there's no disappointment in this,'' Campo added.
``Mainly because I don't know how much merit is considered in some
of these hires. What you've done, doesn't necessarily seem to
matter.

SENATORS CLOSE DOORS FOR DEBATE  
  
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC SANDALOW  
   
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Washington _ With President Clinton's acquittal viewed as a near
certainty, senators met late into Monday night in a rare
closed-door session to debate a Democratic motion to dismiss the
impeachment proceedings.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before the public and the media were ordered out of the chamber,
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said there was enough
Republican opposition to defeat the motion when it comes up for a
vote Tuesday or Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, its introduction was widely viewed as the
beginning of the end for Republican hopes that the trial might
somehow transform public opinion and result in Clinton's removal
from office. Even as House prosecutors prepared a list of witnesses
they would like to see testify, senators from both parties spent
much of the day scrambling to reach an agreement to bring a quick
end to the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only a matter of time before the American people get
their fervently held wish'' that the matter be finished, said Vice
President Al Gore during a stop in San Francisco. ``I think we're
close to the end now.''
</P>
<P>
   As the ninth day of Clinton's impeachment trial came to an end,
the road map toward its conclusion was still a matter of partisan
debate. Democrats offered a plan early in the day to forgo both the
motion to dismiss and the debate over witnesses and proceed
directly to a vote on the two articles of impeachment. The idea was
quickly rebuffed by Republicans, who insisted that even with
witnesses the trial would be over within a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations became so disjointed and frantic that the trial
began an hour late and was twice interrupted by unscheduled
recesses known as ``quorum calls.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to the operations of the United States Senate,'' Lott
said, laughing, as he called the second recess.
</P>
<P>
   Senators adjourned their closed-door meeting nearly five hours
after it began. Citing Senate rules, they refused to discuss what
had transpired inside and whether any new compromises had been
reached.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's procedure for the remainder of the trial _ still
subject to change _ grew so complicated as the day wore on that
even veteran Congress-watchers had difficulty keeping it straight.
</P>
<P>
   As of late last night, the schedule called for the Senate to
proceed Tuesday at 9 a.m. PST with a motion from House managers to
call witnesses. The managers are expected to seek approval to call
Monica Lewinsky, Clinton's secretary Betty Currie and Clinton
confidant Vernon Jordan, among others. White House attorneys are
opposed to witnesses, but may decide to call their own if the
Senate gives prosecutors permission to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Each side will be provided three hours to make its case, which
will be followed by another closed-door meeting of the senators to
discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Votes will then be held _ probably tomorrow, according to Senate
leaders _ on both the motion to dismiss and the motion to call
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Senate is expected to reject the Democratic effort
to dismiss the charges on a mostly party-line vote, the motion to
call witnesses is expected to be close. If it passes, witnesses
will be deposed in private. Then the Senate would be asked to vote
again on whether each individual witness would be called for live
testimony on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   If the motion to bring witnesses fails, the Senate will move
immediately to the two articles of impeachment, starting with
another closed-door debate and ending in a public vote.
</P>
<P>
   Senate rules require impeachment deliberations to be held in
private meetings, although two Democratic senators, Tom Harkin of
Iowa and Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, offered a motion to overturn
that rule Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The motion was defeated by a 57-to-43 count, the first vote of
the impeachment trial. Both California senators, Dianne Feinstein
and Barbara Boxer, voted in favor of the open debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on dangerous, dangerous ground,'' Harkin told reporters
at an impromptu news conference in front of the main doors of the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame the public's not invited. The microphones in the
chamber were paid for by the American people, to paraphrase Ronald
Reagan,'' said Harkin, referring to a comment Reagan made during a
1980 primary debate in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The motion to dismiss was offered by Byrd, widely regarded as
the Senate's pre-eminent guardian of protocol and tradition and a
senator who Republicans had hoped might vote in favor of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In their argument against the motion, Republicans noted that in
the history of the Senate, no impeachment charge against a
president or judge has ever been dismissed without a vote on the
articles themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me assure you that I want this to be over,'' said
Representative Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark. ``As (Clinton adviser) Bruce
Lindsey sitting over here will probably attest, this is bad for me
politically.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we do have our responsibilities,'' Hutchinson said,
echoing a view repeated by numerous House prosecutors. ``And I
happen to believe that we should follow the process which is
dictated by the Constitution and the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Those facts, Republican managers argued in what may be one of
their final chances to persuade senators, include evidence that
Clinton lied under oath and obstructed justice. It was not just to
save his family embarrassment, they asserted. Clinton chose to
break the law because he knew he was in legal jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're sued for ... sexually harassing somebody, and
they're on to the fact that you can't control yourself enough to
stop it four, five years after you're sued, and you're doing it in
the White House with somebody half your age, I think that would
matter,'' said Representative Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that's the difference between getting bamboozled in
court and having to pay $850,000,'' Graham said, referring to
Clinton's out-of-court settlement with Paula Jones, whose sexual
harassment lawsuit touched off the entire controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers also attacked the notion advanced by White
House lawyers that the alleged crimes do not amount to high crimes
and misdemeanors or pose any threat to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the standard urged by the president's lawyers, the
misdeeds of Richard Nixon would not meet the threshold for
impeachment and removal,'' said Representative Charles Canady,
R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The White House countered that nothing in the case warrants the
removal of the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moment has arrived where the best interests of the nation,
the wise prescription of the framers, and the failure of the
managers all point to dismissal,'' said Nicole Seligman, one of
Clinton's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have listened. You have heard. The case cannot be made. It
is time to end it,'' she said on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   Seligman reiterated the White House defense made over more than
a dozen hours of testimony last week _ that the facts do not prove
crimes, and even if they did, they do not constitute ``high crimes
and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   She suggested that Clinton is aware of his misdeeds and is
already paying an appropriate penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Punishment will be found elsewhere,'' she said. ``Judgment
will be found elsewhere. Legacies will be written elsewhere. None
of that will be dismissed. None of that can ever be dismissed.''
</P>
<P>
   And she appealed to the Senate to drop the matter and return to
its lawmaking responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also ask you to end this case now so that the poisonous
arrows of partisanship can be buried and the will of the people can
be done, allowing all of you to spend your full days on the most
pressing issues of the country.''

POPE SEEKS TO AVERT A `PROTESTANTIZED' CATHOLIC CHURCH

 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    During his visit to Mexico and the United States, Pope John Paul
II has expressed his hope to unite the Americas into a single
Catholic church called the ``Synod of America.''
 &HT;    American Catholic unification would solve several Catholic
problems. It could provide for more effective evangelization,
create economic solidarity between the rich and the poor, and
establish religious continuity for Catholics who immigrate to the
North.
 &HT;    Additionally, the pope may hope that the South's Catholic
traditionalism might dilute North American liberalism -- and thus
provide a stricter Catholic counterbalance to secular, post-modern
culture. A more traditional, unified church could combat the sexual
and political movements Rome finds objectionable.
 &HT;    Although the issues facing Roman Catholicism in the Americas
seem completely contemporary, they are entwined with one of Rome's
oldest problems: Protestantism.
 &HT;    In the Americas, as they had in Europe, Catholics and
Protestants handled their differences by separating one from
another. The United States and Canada were Protestant nations with
Catholic minorities left to fend for themselves with recourse to
the law. The rest of the hemisphere was Catholic with Protestant
minorities. The principle formulated in 1648 as a result of the
Thirty Years War in Europe, ``whose territory, whose religion,''
held sway in American religious politics as well.
 &HT;    In North and South America, Catholic and Protestant relations
existed as they had historically. They were bad. For the most part,
Catholics and Protestants had stopped killing one another. But
prejudice, tension and misunderstanding still existed between the
two.
 &HT;    During the 1960s, Vatican II encouraged Catholics to bridge the
gap between themselves and their neighbors. Catholics launched
ecumenical discussions on a world-wide basis. By mid-century,
Catholicism in predominately Protestant countries came to be
perceived as not hostile foreigner but full citizens.
 &HT;    A similar dynamic occurred south of the border. Historically
Catholic countries loosened strictures against proselytization.
Thousands of Protestant missionaries -- mostly fundamentalists and
Pentecostals -- poured into Latin and South America, successfully
converting millions of Catholics to their faith.
 &HT;    In the last fifty years, Americans have witnessed the greatest
religious intermixing between Protestants and Catholics in their
hemispheric history. Catholic ecumenism and immigration created a
greater Catholic presence in the North; Protestant missions
exponentially increased Protestant minorities in the South.
 &HT;    While this shift created greater freedom and inter-faith
cooperation for all Americans, it has also fanned the ancient
flames of Catholic-Protestant tension. And that shift appears to be
the impetus behind the pope's call for a unified church.
 &HT;    For Protestants, the changes have been mostly positive. As the
hemisphere's minority, ecumenism and evangelism strengthened
Protestant presence in every country. In just the last decade,
Protestantism has grown by 40 percent in Mexico alone. In addition,
innumerable Catholic immigrants to the United States have broken
with Catholicism and converted to Protestantism.
 &HT;    Thus, while Catholicism gained acceptance, Protestantism gained
adherents. The demographics worry Rome. If current conversion rates

majorities. Not since the Reformation has Rome faced such
large-scale defections to Protestantism.
 &HT;    Unifying the church directly counters the Protestant challenge
by repositioning and strengthening Catholicism. It also undercuts
ecumenical achievements and inter-faith understanding and could
intensifies regional religious competition.
 &HT;    Rome may not, however, have much choice. Losing people means
losing power, influence and money. Even if Protestantism fails to
win numerical majorities, its influence on Latin America is already
being felt through movements for democracy and social equality. For
Rome, this is more than dwindling church attendance. The future of
Catholic Christendom hangs in the balance.
 &HT;    Rome has always looked warily toward the United States. For
here, as nowhere else, one possible Catholic future exists: Roman
Catholicism is one religion among many in a culture defined by
Protestant individualism and religious pluralism. Although
Protestantism may be the region's numerical minority, its ethos
shapes all of the Americas.
 &HT;    Many U.S. Catholics have adjusted to this by elevating
individual conscience and ignoring church authorities. North
American Catholics are ``good'' Catholics by resembling ``good''
Protestants -- mostly through personal virtue and church
attendance. Obedience to Catholic dogma has little to do with it.
In the Americas, religious intermixing has created Protestantized
Catholicism. And that is what the Vatican dreads.

Protestantized form -- as they threaten to do -- Roman Catholicism

anti-hierarchicalism, ideals of personal liberties (including

vision for Christianity's next millennium.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    During his visit to Mexico and the United States, Pope John Paul
II has expressed his hope to unite the Americas into a single
Catholic church called the ``Synod of America.''
 &HT;    American Catholic unification would solve several Catholic
problems. It could provide for more effective evangelization,
create economic solidarity between the rich and the poor, and
establish religious continuity for Catholics who immigrate to the
North.
 &HT;    Additionally, the pope may hope that the South's Catholic
traditionalism might dilute North American liberalism -- and thus
provide a stricter Catholic counterbalance to secular, post-modern
culture. A more traditional, unified church could combat the sexual
and political movements Rome finds objectionable.
 &HT;    Although the issues facing Roman Catholicism in the Americas
seem completely contemporary, they are entwined with one of Rome's
oldest problems: Protestantism.
 &HT;    In the Americas, as they had in Europe, Catholics and
Protestants handled their differences by separating one from
another. The United States and Canada were Protestant nations with
Catholic minorities left to fend for themselves with recourse to
the law. The rest of the hemisphere was Catholic with Protestant
minorities. The principle formulated in 1648 as a result of the
Thirty Years War in Europe, ``whose territory, whose religion,''
held sway in American religious politics as well.
 &HT;    In North and South America, Catholic and Protestant relations
existed as they had historically. They were bad. For the most part,
Catholics and Protestants had stopped killing one another. But
prejudice, tension and misunderstanding still existed between the
two.
 &HT;    During the 1960s, Vatican II encouraged Catholics to bridge the
gap between themselves and their neighbors. Catholics launched
ecumenical discussions on a world-wide basis. By mid-century,
Catholicism in predominately Protestant countries came to be
perceived as not hostile foreigner but full citizens.
 &HT;    A similar dynamic occurred south of the border. Historically
Catholic countries loosened strictures against proselytization.
Thousands of Protestant missionaries -- mostly fundamentalists and
Pentecostals -- poured into Latin and South America, successfully
converting millions of Catholics to their faith.
 &HT;    In the last fifty years, Americans have witnessed the greatest
religious intermixing between Protestants and Catholics in their
hemispheric history. Catholic ecumenism and immigration created a
greater Catholic presence in the North; Protestant missions
exponentially increased Protestant minorities in the South.
 &HT;    While this shift created greater freedom and inter-faith
cooperation for all Americans, it has also fanned the ancient
flames of Catholic-Protestant tension. And that shift appears to be
the impetus behind the pope's call for a unified church.
 &HT;    For Protestants, the changes have been mostly positive. As the
hemisphere's minority, ecumenism and evangelism strengthened
Protestant presence in every country. In just the last decade,
Protestantism has grown by 40 percent in Mexico alone. In addition,
innumerable Catholic immigrants to the United States have broken
with Catholicism and converted to Protestantism.
 &HT;    Thus, while Catholicism gained acceptance, Protestantism gained
adherents. The demographics worry Rome. If current conversion rates
continue, some parts of Latin America may boast Protestant
majorities. Not since the Reformation has Rome faced such
large-scale defections to Protestantism.
 &HT;    Unifying the church directly counters the Protestant challenge
by repositioning and strengthening Catholicism. It also undercuts
ecumenical achievements and inter-faith understanding and could
intensifies regional religious competition.
 &HT;    Rome may not, however, have much choice. Losing people means
losing power, influence and money. Even if Protestantism fails to
win numerical majorities, its influence on Latin America is already
being felt through movements for democracy and social equality. For
Rome, this is more than dwindling church attendance. The future of

DON'T BE TOO SURE OF A `MARRED' LEGACY FOR CLINTON -- THE
UN-REAGAN 
</HEADLINE>

 &HT;    
 By JIM CASTELLI  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The conventional wisdom -- the consensus among politicians and
media personalities -- has been consistently wrong about the
scandal surrounding President Clinton's relationship with Monica
Lewinsky.
 &HT;    Those who create such ``wisdom'' have been more concerned with
what they want to happen, or what they think is supposed to happen,
rather than what is actually happening.
 &HT;    That's more than enough reason to question the confident
statements that Bill Clinton has been weakened anddisgraced and his
legacy permanently marred.
 &HT;    Put another way, there is reason to believe that Clinton has, in
fact, been strengthened by the scandal and that his legacy will be
far more positive than anyone now imagines.
 &HT;    To be sure, future historians are hardly likely to talk about
Clinton without referring to his impeachment following a full year
of headlines about a sexual scandal. But that won't be the whole
story.
 &HT;    Andrew Johnson was impeached, but historians now generally agree
that his impeachment was highly partisan and that it was Congress,
not Johnson, who was disgraced.
 &HT;    Historians also generally agree that Richard Nixon would have
been impeached and convicted over Watergate-related offenses, and
would have deserved to be, if he had not resigned.
 &HT;    But Nixon's legacy is far bigger than Watergate. His conduct of
the Vietnam War, detente with the Soviet Union, opening of
relations with Communist China, and his domestic policies -- many
of which would be regarded as dismayingly liberal by today's House
Republicans -- are also part of a very mixed legacy.
 &HT;    Bill Clinton was impeached on virtually a straight party-line
vote in the House, but no one beyond a handful of anti-Clinton true
believers think that the Senate trial will result in conviction. At
worst Clinton will receive a censure, at best (for him), nothing
more than impeachment by the House. If Clinton is still president
when all this is over, he will have won.
 &HT;    The notion that he has been weakened by the scandal ignores
public opinion, which has been consistent and resistant for a year.
The more Republicans attack Clinton, the more the public thinks
positively of Clinton and negatively of the Republicans.
 &HT;    In polls taken after the State of the Union address, anywhere
from 66 percent to 76 percent of Americans approved of Clinton's
job performance -- three times the approval rating Nixon had when
he resigned. The president is the most admired man in America and
his wife the most admired woman.
 &HT;    Clinton's party is fresh from a surprisingly strong showing in
the mid-term elections, and while the Republicans still control
Congress, Clinton is within reach of what Nixon used to callan
ideological majority. The Republicans have already lost two
speakers of the House over the Lewinsky affair, and the Republican
Party has its lowest approval rating in a generation.
 &HT;    The claims that the public won't trust Clinton on other issues
because he lied about Lewinsky don't hold up. Even amid all the
references to ``Wag the Dog,'' the public overwhelmingly believed
that Clinton ordered the bombing of Iraq for the right reasons, not
as a distraction from impeachment.
 &HT;    The public doesn't believe Clinton when he talks about things
they don't want to hear about, but they trust him when it comes to
doing his job.
 &HT;    The public also seems to trust Clinton and the Democrats more
than the Republicans on the issues likely to occupy Congress for
the next two years -- Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, HMOs and
education.
 &HT;    And that is the irony behind the likelihood that Clinton's
legacy will be positive: Because of Bill Clinton, the American
people once again want government to work for them.
 &HT;    Clinton is the un-Reagan. Ronald Reagan spent eight years in
office downgrading government. He left the sense that government
shouldn't try to do anything, and he left a gigantic deficit that
made it almost impossible to think about government doing anything
new.
 &HT;    George Bush was somewhat less opposed than Reagan to government
trying to do things for people, but he lamented in his Inaugural
Address that America had more will than wallet.He never tried to
find either will or wallet, and the result -- in the face of a
recession -- was a feeling of national despair and 62 percent of
voters throwing Bush out of office.
 &HT;    Clinton came in arguing that there was nothing wrong with
America that couldn't be fixed by what's right with America.He
believed, in effect, that America could find both will and wallet;
he balanced the federal budget while adding new social programs.
 &HT;    Clinton's push for one big program -- a massive health-care
reform -- failed, but he has made major changes in America through
dozens of smaller changes.
 &HT;    Today, people can't lose health insurance because they change
jobs or have pre-existing conditions, and millions more children
have access to health care. Clinton has succeeded in his goal of
making two years of college or technical school affordable for
virtually every American. The controversial welfare reform bill he
signed has -- so far, at least -- moved people from welfare to work
without forcing people into the streets.
 &HT;    Clinton made it intellectually and financially possible, even
desirable, for Americans to once again look to government to do
good things for people. That's why so many conservatives loathe
him. But it's a heck of a legacy.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Courtesy patrol officer Bruce Murphy, a 22-year
police veteran, offers a few tips for dealing with roadside
problems:
</P>
<P>
   _ Avoid leaving the car, if possible. It can be dangerous to
walk along the shoulder. In the age of cellular phones, someone is
likely to call the police to assist you.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you have a flat tire, don't stop on the road. Drive until
you can get your car safely onto a shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   _ Park on the shoulder, not on the grass. A hot engine can
ignite the grass, and soft surfaces make it dangerous to change a
tire.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you've replaced the tire with a ``doughnut,'' or spare,
drive immediately to a gas station and fill the replacement with
air. They can leak while sitting in the trunk.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you're in a minor accident and there are no injuries, move
your car out of traffic. State law requires motorists to move a car
if it can be moved and there are no injuries in the accident.

 &HT;    Think tank to help conservatives find work
 &HT;    By Dave Harmon
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Texas Public Policy Foundation, a
conservative think tank based in San Antonio, has set up a job bank
to help conservatives find work in state government now that
Republicans have taken over statewide offices.
</P>
<P>
   Offering advice on everything from writing cover letters to how
to dress for an interview _ men: wear black or dark blue suits and
leave the Rush Limbaugh tie at home; women: stick to simple jewelry
and skirts at or below the knee _ the foundation promises to
``recruit and help place conservative job seekers in suitable
positions'' at no charge.
</P>
<P>
   `` 'Staff is policy' as the old saying goes,'' the foundation
says in the introduction to the job bank section of its web site
(www.tppf.org). ``The challenge for our new conservative elected
leaders is to replace the liberal and patronage employees of their
predecessors with qualified, dedicated and loyal conservatives.''
</P>
<P>
   The job bank is under attack by the foundation's political
nemesis, the Texas Freedom Network, which has scheduled a press
conference today to denounce what it calls a ``far right
ideological litmus test'' for state jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The site asks applicants to circle their political ideology,
from Libertarian to Liberal, and includes a lengthy questionnaire
probing their feelings on everything from gays in the military to
labor unions to decriminalizing marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Judson, the foundation's president, said ten people have
filled out the questionnaires since the job bank went up about two
weeks ago. The foundation will send completed applications to
interested agencies, he said, but they will not recommend any
particular applicant.
</P>
<P>
   No agencies have requested the information or pledged to use the
job bank, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, he said, is to encourage conservatives to interrupt
their private sector jobs for a ``tour of duty'' in state
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been concerned about building the kind of infrastructure
in Texas that the Left has had for 100 years,'' Judson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Freedom Network, founded by Cecile Richards _ former
Gov. Ann Richards' daughter _ to counter religious conservative
influence in state government, has been keeping a close eye on the
political activities of the foundation and its founder, Dr. James
Leininger, who has emerged as one of the state's top contributors
to conservative causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's outrageous, actually,'' Kathy Miller, the group's
deputy director, said of the job bank. ``It raises some very
interesting questions about an individual's power over state
agencies, state policy, who gets hired, who gets fired.''
</P>
<P>
   Judson said Leininger, who is on the foundation's board of
directors and is one of its financial backers, doesn't delve into
the details of the foundation's work: ``Jim probably couldn't tell
you much about (the job bank) at all.''
</P>
<P>
   While Miller said she plans to get a legal opinion about whether
state agencies can hire someone based on answers to political
questions, William Hale, executive director of the Texas Commission
on Human Rights _ the agency that enforces employment
discrimination laws in the state _ said there's nothing in state or
federal law prohibiting questions about a job applicant's politics.
</P>
<P>
   Judson told a San Antonio newspaper columnist earlier this month
that he met with Comptroller Carole Keeton Rylander and her staff,
who gave the foundation strong encouragement. Judson said Monday
that a Rylander staffer expressed vague interest in the job bank
but made no commitment to use it.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Elkins, spokesman for the comptroller's office, said
Rylander has been told about the job bank in passing, but ``she has
never endorsed it or indicated in any way that she was going to use
it, and she has not used it.''
</P>
<P>
   That isn't likely to reassure Miller, who noted that Rylander
and several other Republican officeholders are listed as guest
speakers tonight when the Texas Public Policy Foundation holds its
10th Anniversary dinner in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   But from Judson's perspective, the liberals, who have dominated
state government for so long, need to start getting used to
conservatives running things.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Texas Freedom Network and all the candidates they
supported lost, and they just need to buck it up and stop being
sore losers,'' he said.

 &HT;    Spielberg's CD-ROM to instruct students on Holocaust
 &HT;    By Sonja Isger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Palm Beach County high school students
will be the first in the country to get their Holocaust lessons
courtesy of Steven Spielberg and have their teachers trained by the
former director of the research institute of the Holocaust Museum
in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg's Shoah Visual History Foundation, based in Los
Angeles, has spent three years documenting the stories of 50,000
Holocaust survivors, including 289 in Palm Beach, Martin, St. Lucie
and Indian River counties in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In March, three teachers from each high school in the county
will gather to learn how to incorporate an educational CD-ROM
produced by Spielberg into their lesson plans. Their teacher will
be Michael Berenbaum, president of Shoah and the former director of
the Holocaust Research Institute of the U.S. Holocaust Museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully we'll be doing this in other school systems, but
this is the first,'' said Janet Keller, Shoah's media relations
manager.
</P>
<P>
   The school district can thank the non-profit Boca Raton,
Fla.-based League for Educational Awareness of the Holocaust for
being at the top of Shoah's list, Keller said. The group's support
of Holocaust education and its persistence in pushing for a Palm
Beach County training session landed a commitment before the
CD-ROM's scheduled release in March, Keller said.
</P>
<P>
   The CD-ROM, which premiered in a New York high school in
October, allows students to see and hear the stories of four
survivors from New York and Los Angeles in their own words, with
photographs of the survivors and their families before, during and
after the war. With the click of a mouse, students can veer from
the testimony to check out timelines of world events and other
information.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with state law, Palm Beach County's students have
learned about the Holocaust for four years. Some have even talked
with local survivors who come to the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a speaker's bureau. And every time we impart this
information, we share it with someone new, we give them a better
understanding,'' said Eileen Shapiro, who heads the district's
Holocaust education. ``Unfortunately, the average age of a survivor
is 76.''
</P>
<P>
   That was part of the reason Spielberg, who directed the Academy
Award-winning Schindler's List, wanted to create such a massive
archive of recollections, Keller said. The $69 CD-ROM that each
Palm Beach County high school will receive is just one of the
educational materials Shoah produces that are available not just to
schools but other institutions, Keller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holocaust education is about to be revolutionized,'' Keller
said. ``We are making it possible for them to speak to future
generations forever.''
</P>
<P>
   The tab to train the head of each school's library, social
studies and English departments and supply the CD-ROMs comes to
$20,000. That will be split between the district and LEAH, Shapiro
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Steven Spielberg knows how to get his audience,'' Shapiro
said. ``The CD-ROM is narrated by Winona Ryder and Leonardo
DiCaprio. Kids will want to see it.''

 &HT;    Little known service offers big help for motorists in need
 &HT;    (EDS: Runs with TEX-PATROL-TIPS.)
 &HT;    By Debbie Hiott
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Matthew MacMorran was struggling with an
uncooperative lug nut on the right-front wheel of his Ford pickup
when Bruce Murphy pulled up behind him in the inside breakdown lane
of MoPac Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes before, MacMorran had been trying to avoid being hit by
cars that whizzed by only feet away as he tried to change a flat
tire in the middle of heavy traffic. Even after police officer
Bruce Spence closed off the nearest lane of traffic, the work was
still taking time and slowing traffic. Frustrated drivers had begun
honking their horns.
</P>
<P>
   So when Murphy offered to help, MacMorran gladly wiped his
tire-greased hands and watched as Murphy finished the job in less
than 10 minutes with an air gun.
</P>
<P>
   MacMorran didn't know who Murphy was or why he was helping, but
it turns out the help didn't come from the average good Samaritan.
Murphy's job is to roam area highways and help stranded motorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never knew they had this courtesy patrol thing,'' MacMorran
said after thanking Murphy. ``I know I would have been out here a
lot longer if he hadn't come along.''
</P>
<P>
   Spence was also grateful Murphy came along. ``It's definitely a
whole lot simpler when you've got the right tools,'' Spence said.
``A lot of times (the courtesy patrol) can get things moving a
whole lot faster.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the idea behind the state Transportation Department's
2-year-old program. The courtesy patrol, made up of four drivers
and a supervisor, scans area highways for anything that will
slowtraffic, whether it's a stranded motorist or a pile of wood in
the road. It's not just about courtesy. The goal of the $250,000 a
year program is to improve traffic flow in congested areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know, because of limited funds and different problems
building new roads, that we have to make the best of what we
have,'' said Sam Cox, the former Austin police sergeant who now
heads up the courtesy patrol. ``We're trying to keep the roadways
running more efficiently.''
</P>
<P>
   Population growth in the region has led to major traffic
increases. For example, the average daily traffic on Interstate 35
near U.S. 183 increased almost 40 percent between 1990 and 1997.
Travis County averages more than 12,500 traffic accidents a year,
and when those occur on major highways, they can tie up traffic for
hours. Smaller incidents, such as vehicles with flat tires or those
that have stalled, can also slow the flow.
</P>
<P>
   While MacMorran's truck was disabled, one lane of MoPac was
closed to traffic, and gawkers slowed things even more, creating
lines of cars, bumper to bumper, from just north of 45th Street all
the way south of the 35th Street exit. But within minutes after the
pickup was on its way, traffic flowed smoothly again.
</P>
<P>
   Unsung hero
</P>
<P>
   Cox said many people don't know about the service, although the
courtesy patrollers help thousands of motorists in a year.
</P>
<P>
   From Sept. 1 to Dec. 31, the patrol members handled 1,721 calls.
In that time, they changed 285 flat tires, refueled 103 cars,
removed debris from the roads 247 times, assisted in clearing 125
accidents, gave mechanical assistance to stranded drivers 249 times
and pushed stalled cars from the road 79 times.
</P>
<P>
   The program is modeled after similar patrols in Fort Worth and
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Cox said the department hopes to expand the patrol to put more
vehicles on the streets and has asked the Austin Police Department
to help pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every stalled car we take off the expressway is a stalled car
the police don't have to deal with,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, a 22-year veteran of the New York Police Department who
moved to the Austin area two years ago, says the reaction of the
people he helps is the best part of the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the few jobs where people are glad to see you,''
Murphy said. ``Usually when they see the state, someone's holding
them up working on a road.''
</P>
<P>
   Beating the streets
</P>
<P>
   Murphy's work day begins when the morning is still dark and the
streets are almost empty, as he checks over the patrol truck loaded
with everything from heavy tools to kitty litter for oil spills to
duct tape, which Murphy dubs ``the all-American cure-all.''
</P>
<P>
   Around 6 a.m. he pulls out of the statedistrict office near U.S.
183 and I-35 to begin scanning the roads for drivers who need help.
During rush hour, the courtesy patrol focuses on I-35, where on the
average day there are more than enough stalled cars and accidents
to keep the two courtesy trucks busy. The patrol divides the city
into two parts, north and south, with the boundary at 51st Street,
and after rush hour, they branch out onto other state roads such as
RM 620 and Loop 1.
</P>
<P>
   The calls vary from day to day. There are the mundane stops to
fix a flat or fill an empty gas tank. There are times when police
need help managing an accident scene. And then there are times when
the courtesy patrol arrives first to determine what's wrong: a man
who has had a heart attack, a woman who is crippled by a migraine.
</P>
<P>
   One day, it was a van full of Bible school students and a
teacher. They had watched car after car pass their van with a flat
tire on I-35 near U.S. 183. The teacher later told Murphy that she
turned to higher intervention when even a police car passed without
stopping. But the police officer had called for the courtesy
patrol, and moments later Murphy rolled up to relieved faces. The
teacher greeted him eagerly.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `We just finished our prayer and you pulled up,' ''
Murphy said. ``She told the children it worked.'' One of the
hardest parts of the job, Murphy said, is convincing the drivers he
helps that he can't accept a tip and there is no fee for the
program, which is supported with taxpayer money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing we're out here for is safety,'' Murphy said.
``Courtesy patrol is what I want on the road when my wife's car
breaks down.''

 &HT;    Ohio city looks to Big Apple for guidance on X-rated business
 &HT;    By Jim Bebbington
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Dayton is studying whether it can enact a New
York City-style ordinance that limits where adult-oriented
businesses can operate.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court this month upheld New York City's law
that forced many X-rated businesses out of Times Square. Mayor Mike
Turner hailed the court's decision and would like to see a similar
ordinance here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very exciting the U.S. Supreme Court has finally given
us the tools to deal with this,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   New York decided to challenge the businesses as neighborhood
blights instead of focusing on obscenity. The law required
adult-oriented theaters, bookstores and dance bars to be at least
500 feet from each other, homes, churches or certain businesses. It
gave the businesses a year to move.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton has had see-saw battles against adult businesses for
decades and has unsuccessfully charged bookstore operators for
pandering obscenity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will not totally prohibit operation of these businesses
in the city but it would require their closure and relocation away
from neighborhoods and commercial districts,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton's effort comes as Ohio's Troy, Franklin, Washington Twps.
and other communities seek to limit where adult businesses can
operate.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Sirkin, a Cincinnati attorney who represents the owners of
Total Xposure in Troy and Diamonds Cabaret in Washington Twp., said
Ohio law might prohibit Dayton from enacting a New York-style law.
</P>
<P>
   New York allowed businesses one year to pay off the debts they
incurred in opening before they had to shut down and move. Ohio law
does not allow for so-called amortization, Sirkin said, and has
allowed adult-oriented businesses to stay open on the same property
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Any attempt to alter that would be challenged in court, Sirkin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton already uses zoning laws to restrict where new adult
businesses can operate, Sirkin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have not been any increase in adult uses for a very long
time (in Dayton),'' Sirkin said. ``The stores on Third Street and
the stores on Fifth Street have been there for a very long time.''

 &HT;    Winter weather doubles farmers' workloads
 &HT;    By Scott Elliott
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Cows aren't any better at walking on a sheet of
ice than people, which is why Casstown, Ohio farmer Clyde Musser
cringed every time he checked on his cattle during the winter
storms this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The barnyard was covered with ice and the cows were sliding
around like they were wearing roller skates,'' he said. ``It hasn't
been a very healthy situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Musser's 30 cows are important to his livelihood, and caring for
them through the extremes of winter is hard work. Jeff Layman, Ohio
State extension agent for agriculture in Miami County, said winter
months present several challenges for farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ups and downs of winter cause a lot of problems _ whether
it's keeping animals healthy, making sure water supplies don't
freeze, watching for moisture in grain storage or even just
starting a diesel engine,'' Layman said.
</P>
<P>
   David Demmitt cares for 100 full-grown cows and 75 calves at his
farm near Troy, Ohio. Snow, ice and mud mean long hours, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really doubles our workload with the cows,'' Demmitt said.
``Our two main goals are keeping the cows warm and dry and keeping
them clean to protect milk quality.''
</P>
<P>
   When the animals are wet and cold they can become ill, he said,
and frozen surfaces can cause cows to slip and be injured. An extra
35 to 40 bales of straw must be brought to the barns each day so
cows don't have to feed in the field.
</P>
<P>
   The storm that hit around New Year's Day came from the east,
creating extra complications for farms with buildings that are
constructed to protect against Ohio storms that generally come from
the west or north, said Jerry Mahan, Ohio State extension agent for
agriculture in Greene County.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a different kind of storm,'' Mahan said. ``Those are
usually the worst ones. The snow drifted in ways you wouldn't
normally expect.''
</P>
<P>
   During a major storm, farmers must keep a constant watch on the
delicate systems that are vital to their operations. Demmitt heats
the farm's water pipes to them prevent freezing, but malfunctions
or ice still pose potential problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to keep water from freezing and keep everything
working,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller farms with less technology often suffer most during
winter storms, Mahan said. In Greene County, Mahan heard from
several farmers who were saddled with frozen pipes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating for those guys to have to dig them up and
repair them,'' he said. ``But the animals must have something to
drink.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who grow crops, selling their corn or grain is always
a guessing game. To get a better price, farmers may store some of
their products through the winter. For them, blowing snow can be
devastating.
</P>
<P>
   If snow blows in through vents and piles on top of stored grain,
the snow must be removed before it melts. Water dripping down into
the grain can cause mold and spoil the entire supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to keep constantly monitoring it,'' Casstown farmer
Carl Shoup said. ``I take a load out every once in a while just to
check it. If it gets out of condition, nobody wants it.''
</P>
<P>
   Shoup, who farms 1,150 acres, has about 35,000 bushels of corn
and grain stored while he waits for a good opportunity to sell.
</P>
<P>
   He also worries about floodwater that flowed around his farm
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have so much water, you have some erosion,'' he said.
``It's too early to tell if there has been any damage. We'll just
have to get out there in the spring and see.''

 &HT;    High-fee DRIPs not much of a bargain
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DRIPs _ dividend reinvestment plans _ have been unbeatable
bargains for small-time stock buyers like you and me for years.
Many of them still are.
</P>
<P>
   But some companies are doing the all-American thing: tacking on
new services and raising their fees. You may or may not want the
services, but you can't avoid the fees.
</P>
<P>
   At worst, a company may charge you $5, plus 5 cents or more per
share, to add to your DRIP account. That's unbearable if you want
to invest, say, $50 a month in the company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, it's no longer enough to be a willing buyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You also have to be a more careful shopper now,'' said Billy
Williams, president of the Atlanta area organization of private
investment clubs. ``You have to ask whether it's worth the premium.
And a lot of people are saying, `No.'''
</P>
<P>
   A DRIP is a way to buy stock directly from the issuing company,
without going through a broker and paying a sales fee. Dividends
are automatically used to buy more shares, and investors also can
make cash payments to buy yet more shares.
</P>
<P>
   DRIPs have become popular with low-dollar investors _ people who
can afford to invest perhaps $25 or $50 a month and want to watch
their investments grow steadily.
</P>
<P>
   The fees are changing things, however. They can include purchase
fees, annual account maintenance fees and even fees for selling
your shares.
</P>
<P>
   One explanation for such fees is that companies, and the
transfer agents they hire to handle the accounts, are entitled to
make a buck wherever they can. A more charitable explanation is
they are simply covering their costs.
</P>
<P>
   Charles B. Carlson, editor of the DRIP Investor newsletter in
Hammond, Ind., estimates that the cost of administering an account
runs $12 to $16 a year. ``This is a cost-conscious corporate
America we have today,'' he said. ``They're looking for ways to
defray the cost of servicing these shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all companies have high charges for the DRIPs, however. Vita
Nelson, who edits The DRP Authority, another newsletter in the
field, estimates that 200 have notable fees. Well over 1,000
companies have DRIPs.
</P>
<P>
   The fees usually are accompanied by extra services. Companies
may offer opportunities to buy shares daily or weekly. You may be
able to sell shares over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies will set up an individual retirement account, and
some allow investors to borrow against shares in their accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Two Web sites, one associated with each of the newsletters
mentioned above, will give conscientious shoppers a start. They are
http://www.netstockdirect.com and http://www.moneypaper.com.
</P>
<P>
   You will find links to many companies with DRIPs and assistance
in buying shares in some of those companies. The Moneypaper site
also pitches a new mutual fund restricted to a set of companies
that offer low-cost DRIPs. Note that the expense ratio can go as
high as 1.25 percent. That may well come down as the fund matures,
but it is high for bargain-hungry stock buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Also note that since those Web sites don't always have all the
details about DRIPs, serious shoppers may need to ask the companies
for further information.
</P>
<P>
   Among low-cost DRIPs, Carlson lists these favorites: Regions
Financial, Exxon, Johnson Controls, Finova Group and Philadelphia
Suburban.
</P>
<P>
   Among higher-fee companies, Nelson points to Aetna, Air
Products, Dayton Hudson and McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   There are some ways to lower the impact of DRIP fees:
</P>
<P>
   _ Shop carefully and switch to companies that don't charge high
fees.
</P>
<P>
   How much is too much? ``I would think that when it's more than
10 percent, that's getting pretty high,'' said Williams. A $5 fee
on a $50 purchase would be out of limits for him.
</P>
<P>
   _ Consider quarterly rather than monthly investments. Reducing
the number of purchases also reduces the cost.
</P>
<P>
   _ Go to automatic investments, which means authorizing the
company to take a given amount from your checking account each
month. The purchase fee is usually lower, typically falling from $5
to $2 per transaction.
</P>
<P>
   _ Consider dumping the whole idea and buying instead through a
discount broker.

 &HT;    Potty training vs. life training
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ My 31-year-old son called this afternoon for
a check-up and a chat - we chat while he checks up on me. He thinks
I don't know what he's up to. Hesitantly, I ask how things are
going for him. Terrific, he says. Couldn't be better, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Not true, I say. ``You just think you're all right,'' I warn,
``but the truth of it is, you're immature and will probably develop
behavior problems later in life because I didn't assert myself when
I was potty training you.'' A split-second of silence is quickly
followed by hilarity as he asks what kind of a book I've gotten
into this time. This kid knows me too well.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, I've been reading an article by a psychologist who
insists that wishy-washy mommys who are unable to give up their
role as caretaker (changing diapers) to assume that of an authority
figure (potty training) have wrecked their kids. ``Thanks to me,''
I whimper apologetically, ``you're probably constipated and suffer
from bladder-control problems. Hell, I may even be responsible for
your morning breath.''
</P>
<P>
   He tells me to relax. ``I think you did just fine, Mom. I have
none of the symptoms you mentioned and don't forget how much fun
you have telling large gatherings of people about my toilet
training.''
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, my cerebral approach to housebreaking the child was
a little odd, but I liked the nonconfrontational idea of having a
meeting of the minds as opposed to two people spending tense hours
in the bathroom while the taller of the pair tries to convince the
shorter one he has to pee.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how we did it: First we shopped for a potty chair. He
chose a streamlined model with a lid. We put it in his bathroom
next to the real thing. He was tickled pink with it. He stuck his
head in it, put the cat in it, and stored his Matchbox cars in it.
But never considered sitting on it.
</P>
<P>
   It was time, I decided, for an intellectual meeting of the minds
(bribery). ``Kristofor, how'd you like some underpants like
Papa's?'' Yep, he'd like that. ``It means you'd have to use the
toilet.'' Nope, he wouldn't like that. I told him to let me know
when it was time to shop for his ``Big boy'' pants. He agreed and
continued to use his potty chair as a garage.
</P>
<P>
   One morning, a couple of months later, he rousted me out of bed
at sun-up and gleefully announced he was pretty sure it was time to
ditch the diapers. ``But first,'' he said, ``my gots to see
sumpin', OK?''
</P>
<P>
   OK. We filed down the hall to his bathroom where he asked me to
take off his diapers so he could measure. Measure what, I asked as
I unpinned. ``Gots to see if I can reach.'' Now I understood what
he'd been waiting for. He wasn't going to do it at all until he
could do it right. The little potty was cool for trucks and Siamese
cats, but it was the big potty that was going to make him a man
like his papa.
</P>
<P>
   The good doctor says what makes such an antiquated approach to
toilet training (mine) so silly is the fact that it could be a snap
if moms would heed his ``naked and $75'' technique. That's where
you take off the kid's diaper, put a potty within reach and wait
for the inevitable accident to happen. When it does you put the kid
on the pot and use the 75 bucks to have the carpet cleaned. ``Kids
that age hate to have `it' running down their legs,'' he explains,
so they train themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Baloney! Two-year-olds will wallow in mud and wail when Mom
washes it off. And hasn't the Doc ever seen a kid who's been eating
waffles refuse to wash his hands because he likes having his
fingers stuck to his palm?
</P>
<P>
   Kristofor reassures me that he is functioning normally and
seldom has the urge to suck his thumb or rob a bank. That's good
enough for me.

 &HT;    Wonderful idea spawns event that has hooked thousands
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Vinnie's fish was loose. The little boy in the
high-backed wheelchair had, literally, a lap full of trout for a
moment.
</P>
<P>
   What sensations were going through that mind: Of droplets
spritzed from a wiggling tail to his cheeks. Of that
never-to-mistake, current-fresh smell.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteer David Dover picked the 6-incher up from off the floor
and held it thrashing to Vinnie's cupped hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to keep it? Or put it back?''
</P>
<P>
   A nod and a smile are Vinnie's chief means of expression. He
nodded more vigorously at ``put it back.'' Dover returned it to the
tank.
</P>
<P>
   At the Really Big Fishing Event for Really Special People,
bringing home a trophy, or frying-pan fodder, was way down the list
of prizes.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake. A lot of those fish were going to get eaten. A
crack team of fish cleaners from Baylor's KOT fraternity did
nothing but clean from start to finish. Talk about service above
and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   That's been the theme of this event since its inception _ of
good people stepping forward to do right by fellow human beings
they've never met, and who they wouldn't meet otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday close to 1,000 disabled people fished, while 525
volunteers helped. The fisherpersons came from as far away as Tyler
and Georgetown for the special moments this event provides. The
idea was hatched 11 years ago as a lone fishing tank in the corner
of a room. Now it's an extravaganza with karaoke, dancing, a photo
studio with a grab-bag of disguises, and food, food, food.
</P>
<P>
   Waco resident Gary Beeson and Baylor student Sarah Borum were
talking with their mouths full. Beeson is deaf. Borum is studying
sign language at Baylor. She came just to be a part of what fellow
Kappas were doing to help out. She ended up escorting Beeson
through the event as they engaged in lively conversation
unencumbered by chili dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Fabian is blind, in Waco for computer training at the VA
Medical Center. Minnesota is home. As such, he clearly was
relishing the sinking of a line in January without having to bore
through ice. He also was enjoying jawing with anyone and everyone,
in the great fisherman's tradition.
</P>
<P>
   McLennan County Constable Travis Bailey and Butch Shaw, who runs
Heart of Texas Industries for the Texas Department of Mental-Health
Mental Retardation, can claim shares of responsibility for the
runaway success of this event.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey, a fishing fanatic, was at the first such fishing event
in 1988 sponsored by the Governor's Committee for the Disabled. It
was an inspired notion, to give people who never get such chances
their first taste of a cherished sport. When the idea didn't get
picked up for a second year, Bailey stepped up. He ended up, with
the hard work of many key players like the Optimist Club of Waco,
managing the whole kettle of fish.
</P>
<P>
   But the story Saturday wasn't about fish. It was about human
contact, and mist on cheeks, and feelings that, once felt, are
forever, like the first pull on a line.

 &HT;    Pepper is golf's Mrs. October
 &HT;    By Craig Dolch
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Dottie Pepper was steamed. For weeks,
she had been looking forward to watching the Presidents Cup. She
had even planned her daily schedule around when the action in
Australia would be televised back to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But the most successful woman in international golf competition
was soon wishing she had made alternate plans. It wasn't just that
the International team trashed the favored Americans, 20.5-11.5; it
was the ease with which the Americans seemed to take the loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a lot of uninspired play,'' Pepper said. ``It just
seemed like they didn't have much flair. I don't know if you get
that from your captain or from something you read before the match
or it's just sort of in-bred. I was just real disappointed with
what I saw.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepper, who recently moved to Jupiter, Fla., is the LPGA's
version of Mr. October _ saving her A game for the Solheim Cup. She
has won 14 LPGA events (but none since 1996), was Player of the
Year in 1992 and is sixth in career earnings ($4.51 million). But
she has earned greater notoriety in recent years for her emotional
_ and sometimes controversial _ play in the Solheim.
</P>
<P>
   Pepper went 4-0 last year while leading the Americans to a 16-12
victory over the Europeans, making the 33-year-old the winningest
player in Solheim competition (12-4-1). With her qualifications
(and history of saying what's on her mind), Pepper was asked why
the American men keep getting upset in the Presidents and Ryder
cups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're a little spoiled to begin with,'' she said.
``When you can go out and not win a tournament and still make $1
million, I think that makes you pretty comfortable. It's also hard
when you walk in with 12 of the best players in the world ... there
are egos involved and there's no room for that. They (the U.S.
team) needed something to get them going.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a punching bag, perhaps? That's what Pepper was being used
as by the Europeans at the Solheim. The fiery New York native
angered the Europeans for allegedly inciting the pro-American
gallery to root against her opponents at a key moment late in the
second day. Afterward, in the European team's locker room, Laura
Davies and Annika Sorenstam took turns pummeling an inflatable
punching bag, with Sorenstam imploring her teammates to join her in
imagining it was Pepper's face on the bag.
</P>
<P>
   Four months later, Pepper still shakes her head and wonders what
she did wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I woke up Sunday morning and I glanced at the paper and said,
`Gee, do I have an evil twin or what?' '' Pepper said. ``All I know
is this: When you're getting beat, you're going to find something
to get your team turned around. They went looking. When the English
media comes up to me and apologizes to me for what was drummed up,
that tells me a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's Pepper, too _ telling a lot. With a demeanor every
bit as saucy as her name, Pepper has become one of the LPGA's most
outspoken and talented players.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who watches her this week in The Office Depot at Ibis
Golf &AMP; Country Club will see she talks the way she plays golf, with
bulldog-type tenacity, sometimes filling the air with a ``Dang it,
Dottie,'' after a mediocre shot. When she gets in contention, her
stare could rival Raymond Floyd's.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a very intense player and sometimes that rubs people the
wrong way,'' said Juli Inkster, Pepper's closest friend on tour.
``She takes her golf very seriously, and there's nothing wrong with
that. I think she's great for the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepper's husband, Ralph Scarinzi, who caddied for her for about
three years before they got married, said Dottie's competitive
exuberance isn't really out of place in sports. It's just that
she's looked at differently because of her gender.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at Tiger (Woods), and some of what he does when he
executes a good shot or makes a putt, throwing his fist up in the
air, it's no different. But Dottie not's supposed to do that
because she's a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Scarinzi said he stopped caddying for his wife last summer
because they needed separation of work and home life. Sort of the
worlds-colliding theory.
</P>
<P>
   Having seen Pepper's personality from all angles, he knows it
might help if she were to lighten up. But he knows that's not about
to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I'd like to see her have a little more fun on the golf
course and not take everything as life and death,'' he said. ``But
I don't know how successful she'll be if she changed. But how long
a career can you have this way?''
</P>
<P>
   Pepper and Scarinzi moved their residence from South Carolina to
the Loxahatchee Club last December, buying a house owned by Jackie
Nicklaus. Pepper says one of the main reasons she headed south was
to try to make sure her game didn't follow the same direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're trying to prepare in a place where the average
temperature is 50 degrees, I don't think that's real conducive to
being ready to play in January,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Not that she has anything to apologize for. Although she hasn't
won since a torrid stretch in 1996 (four victories in a 10-week
span), last year she was 10th on the money list and second in
scoring (70.46, which was a third of a stroke lower than when she
won Player of the Year honors in '92).
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't see a problem with how I've played the last two
years,'' she said. ``I may not have played well in 1997 by my
standards, but I had a lot going on.''
</P>
<P>
   In May '95 Pepper was divorced from Doug Mochrie, whom she had
known since she was 13, and married while attending Furman. By '97,
Pepper was romantically involved with Ralph Scarinzi, who had been
her caddy for three years. They married last January, and Scarinzi
stopped carrying her bag last summer. (To the delight of headline
writers, Pepper is back using her maiden name.)
</P>
<P>
   Pepper's preparations for this year were slowed, however, when
she had minor surgery on two toes on her right foot and the index
finger on her left hand. She's been practicing for only two weeks,
so it might be another slow start.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'll win again soon,'' Inkster says. ``I think she's settled
in now, getting married. I think she's more at ease with herself.''
</P>
<P>
   But this Pepper will never be bland on the golf course. She may
play her grand piano at home, spend time in her garden, walk her
pet dog named Furman and sip from her wine collection. But this is
not a sign she's changing and mellowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm comfortable with my reputation,'' she said. ``I think it
takes people to be outspoken because this tour can be a lot better,
but it takes people really caring about it to make a difference.''

 &HT;    Orr a Bure admirer
 &HT;    By Al Tays
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ There's no mistaking the emotion in
Bobby Orr's voice, even through a telephone line. Whether he's
talking about his admiration for new Florida Panther Pavel Bure,
his fond memories of playing junior hockey or his opposition to
those who say hockey has become too violent, the former NHL
superstar and Tequesta resident speaks with joyous passion about
his favorite game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our game,'' he repeatedly calls it, and you know he isn't
about to let go of it.
</P>
<P>
   Orr, 50, spoke with reporters last week as part of a promotion
for Canadian junior hockey. When he wasn't reminiscing about his
days as a teenager playing for the Oshawa Generals, he talked about
being a Palm Beach County resident watching the Florida Panthers on
TV and going to the occasional game at the National Car Rental
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, he's been very excited about what he's seen, especially
from the Panthers' new superstar, Bure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Florida made a great deal (with Vancouver to acquire
Bure),'' Orr said. ``Pavel . . . he's not even in shape yet, so you
haven't seen a thing yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are going to love this kid. He's a heck of a player and
he's a great young man. He's going to be great not only on the ice
but in the community with the kids and with the fans.''
   Orr marveled at Bure's debut last Wednesday, in which he scored
two goals against the New York Islanders after a 10-hour flight
from Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a pretty good start,'' Orr said with a laugh, ``for a
kid that just flew over from Russia right to New York and gets on
the ice and scores two. But he's a special, special player. He's up
there with all the best players in the league. I think Bill
(Panthers president Bill Torrey) and his crew made a great deal.
</P>
<P>
   Orr agrees with Panthers coach Terry Murray that Bure's mere
presence will elevate the play of his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question,'' he said. ``Wayne Gretzky makes everybody better
around him. So do Mario (Lemieux) and all the great players.
There's no question Pavel Bure will make everybody better around
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know you're going to get a goal or two a night from him _
on an average _ so it makes you feel pretty good. Florida's having
a little trouble scoring, but he's going to score plenty and you'll
see other players start to put it in also.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the NHL style of play that resulted in nearly two
dozen player suspensions the first half of the season, Orr was
quick to differentiate between rough play and dirty play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some things do happen in our game that we don't like to see,''
he said, ``the hitting from behind, the high sticking . . . but
overall, I don't look at our game as being violent. There's some
stupidity, which we must get out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot get our game to the point where nobody wants to hit.
Hitting is a very, very important part of the game _ good, clean
bodychecks. I played with Johnny Bucyk in Boston, and 'Chief' won
the Lady Byng Trophy for gentlemanly play. Yet he hit guys harder
than anybody I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Orr said the solution to eliminating dirty play is simple,
consistent enforcement of the rules. ``The high-sticking, the
hitting from behind, the kicking the skates out _ there's no place
in our game for that,'' he said. ``And that's what we've got to be
working on. We have rules in the rule book _ enforce them. If we
enforce them, players are going to know, 'Hey, I can't do that.'
But one night (the officials) might let it go and the next night
they don't, so players, they don't know what's going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think our game is violent. I don't think that at all.
Hockey is a tough game. There are big men out there. In the old
days you might get a big player or two on a team, but they weren't
very fast and they couldn't catch you. Today they're all big and
they can all catch you.''

 &HT;    Pippen opens second act
 &HT;    By Mark Rosner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The National Basketball Association's greatest sideman
might have an opportunity to command a more prominent part of the
stage, but Scottie Pippen said he is satisfied to blend in with the
Houston Rockets, just as he did for most of his 11 years in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   As Pippen moves to the next phase of his career after a trade to
the Rockets, inquiring minds want to know if will emerge from the
engulfing shadow of Michael Jordan only to run beside one cast by
Hakeem Olajuwon. Will Pippen drive the Houston Rockets to a third
NBA championship, or does he prefer to ride shotgun, the more
familiar position? Maybe the two players will take turns steering.
</P>
<P>
   The early indications are that Pippen is deferential.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team revolves around Hakeem,'' Pippen said. ``This is his
team. I'm not putting any pressure on myself to carry the team. If
it's going to happen, it will happen naturally. This is an
established team with some great players. There's no reason to go
out and disrupt the chemistry they've worked so hard for.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen, 33, has made a nice career as a complementary player,
one judged in 1996 by a panel of voters to be among the top 50 in
NBA history, a status shared by his new teammates Olajuwon and
Charles Barkley. Pippen has been more than some functional role
player, someone to be replaced when a younger part came along.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel we have the most complete player in basketball playing
for us now,'' Rockets Coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. ``There isn't
anything on a basketball court Scottie can't do.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen's career averages for 11 years of 18 points, 6.8 rebounds
and 5.3 assists do not tell his story adequately. A slender,
long-limbed athletic forward/guard, the 6-foot-7-inch Pippen has
been named to the NBA's all-defensive first team seven times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if there's a better defensive player in
understanding visualization of what the opponent's about,''
Pippen's coach with the Bulls, Phil Jackson said. ``He's a one-man
wrecking crew.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics judging Pippen have often pointed out that he failed to
win a championship when Jordan was retired during the 1993-94
season and after Jordan returned in time for the playoffs in
1994-95. But one of their former teammates, Steve Kerr, is not sure
how Jordan would have fared without Pippen, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``As great as Michael was, there's no question without Scottie,
he wouldn't have been able to win six titles,'' said Kerr, now with
the San Antonio Spurs. ``He might have been able to pull off one or
two, I don't know, but Scottie was the key to our team defensively.
He was really our point guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Scottie,'' Kerr said. ``He's one of my favorite
teammates of all time. He's so unselfish. I think a lot of players
down there will be pretty happy to have him.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when word came to the Rockets that Pippen will joint
them, veteran Eddie Johnson said, ``Scottie's definitely the best
all-around player in the league now. He hasn't gotten his just due
because he's had to play with Jordan all this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley, who helped recruit Pippen to the Rockets said,
``Scottie can take over games. He did it for the Bulls a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen was not always cast in the subordinate role. He averaged
career-highs in scoring (22 points) and rebounds (8.7) when Jordan
was off chasing curve balls in 1993-94. But the Bulls lost to New
York in the second round of the playoffs, a series that included
the most embarrassing moment of Pippen's career. In the third game
of the Eastern Conference semifinals, he refused to return to the
court with 1.8 seconds left when Coach Phil Jackson designed a play
for Toni Kukoc instead of Pippen, the kind of decision that can
scar an athlete for life. With Pippen on the bench, Kukoc made the
game-winning shot.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen later acknowledged that he made a ``stupid mistake.''
Asked last season if he fears that less than two seconds of his
career might leave a disproportionately-sized mark on his legacy,
Pippen said, ``I don't care if they forget it or not. I think I've
had a great career overall.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident is one of several calamities on Pippen's resume
along with the points, rebounds, assists and accolades. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   _In the 1990 Eastern Conference finals, he suffered a migraine
headache that caused blurred vision. He played 40 minutes during a
defeat for the Bulls, but some labeled him a quitter.
</P>
<P>
   _He criticized Bulls management for pursuing Kukoc, a star in
Europe, during the early 1990s, offering him more money that Pippen
was getting paid. Pippen was so fixated on Kukoc that he asked for
the job of guarding him during the 1992 Olympics when the U.S. team
faced Yugoslavia. Pippen wanted to ``get at him because I couldn't
get at (Bulls' general manager Jerry) Krause,'' he told the Chicago
Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   _While he was out of the lineup for the first 35 games last
season after undergoing surgery on his left foot, Pippen said he
had no intention of ever playing for the Bulls again because the
organization did not show him the proper respect. Pippen went so
far as to imply he was faking the injury because he was angry with
the Bulls' management.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen has been justifiably upset with his relatively meager
pay. He earned $2.8 million last season, only fifth-highest on his
team and 122nd in the league. But critics, while acknowledging that
slight, suggested Pippen reacted immaturely. It was perhaps
Pippen's mistake to sign a contract in 1991for less money than he
deserved and his misfortune that Bulls' owner Jerry Reinsdorf has a
policy not to renegotiate.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen finally has a large contract _ $67 million over five
years with another possible $15 million through incentive clauses.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen worked long and hard for this reward, but then he has had
to fight for everything. He might be the biggest success story in
the NBA. Pippen was 6-1 and 135 pounds when he graduated from
Hamburg (Ark.) High. No one offered him an athletic scholarship.
When his high school coach called the University of Central
Arkansas and said he had this kid with potential, the college
offered him a work-study grant under the condition that he would
become the team's manager. Pippen swept the gym floor, washed
uniforms, averaged 4 points and 3 rebounds a game.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, he had grown to 6-7 though still thin. He
averaged 24 points and 10 rebounds and impressed pro scouts at NBA
camps, where he competed against more prominent college players
from bigger schools. Seattle selected Pippen with the fifth pick of
the 1987 draft and sent him to the Bulls in exchange for the rights
to the No. 8 pick, Olden Polynice, and future draft considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Since joining the league, Pippen's highlights have far
superceded his mistakes in judgement. Case in point:

<P>
   _He contributed 32 points, 13 rebounds, seven assists and five
steals in the last game of the 1991 NBA Finals against the Los
Angeles Lakers, helping Chicago secure its first of six
championships.
</P>
<P>
   _His averages of 18.1 points and 7.7 rebounds in the playoffs
and 19 points and 8.3 rebounds in the NBA Finals are higher than
for the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   _He displayed great versatility by effectively guarding Indiana
point guard Mark Jackson during the Eastern Conference finals last
season.
</P>
<P>
   For an encore, Pippen played in the finals against Utah with
unbearable pain from a back injury that would require off-season
surgery. He could barely move during the decisive sixth game.
Pippen, whose courage was questioned early in his career, was now
considered tough and brave.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real measurement of Scottie was against Utah,'' former
Bulls center Bill Cartwright later said. ``Most players would have
just stayed in the locker room.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was the star, of course, the one who stole the ball from
Karl Malone and then made the winning shot. But Pippen was right
there, too, the game's greatest sideman.

 &HT;    Impeachment, Super Bowl, it's all the same

<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ For the first time in its 33-year
history, the Super Bowl will be played while an impeached American
president is on trial in the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   You may think this is coincidental. You may even imagine that
the two events, each of them grand spectacles on the American
stage, have no connections or similarities.
</P>
<P>
   But you probably haven't given this as much thought as I have.
</P>
<P>
   If you did, you'd see that the connection between these two
pageants might seem tenuous at first. But not when you take a
deeper look.

 &HT;    Broadway's Legend _ Namath's best call
 &HT;    By Ethan J. Skolnick
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Broadway Joe was well fortified when he addressed the
Miami Touchdown Club.
</P>
<P>
   Broadway Joe had two stewardesses waiting in another room at the
Miami Springs Villas . . . or that may have been another night. He
had four, or five, or six Johnnie Walker Reds before he took to the
dais . . . or maybe it wasn't that many. He had come to be honored
by the Miami Touchdown Club on Jan. 9, 1969, three nights before
Super Bowl III, against the wishes of his coach, Weeb Ewbank . . .
or perhaps Joe Namath had been the reluctant one.
</P>
<P>
   Can't guarantee any of it.
</P>
<P>
   It's been 30 years since the quarterback, dressed in a soft
green suit, grabbed food and a beer at the New York Jets' poolside
barbecue at the Galt Ocean Mile Hotel in Fort Lauderdale, and
entered a limousine headed for Miami Springs. Details of the next
four hours have been colored by three decades of interpretation and
exaggeration, by the several hundred who came to Dade County's
primo spot to crown Namath ``the Outstanding Professional Football
Player of 1968.''
</P>
<P>
   But this can be guaranteed:
</P>
<P>
   Namath made sport's most famous guarantee that night, predicting
the Jets, at the time 19-point underdogs, would upset the Baltimore
Colts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was typical Joe,'' said New York Times columnist Dave
Anderson, who chronicled the Jets' week in the 1969 book Countdown
to Super Bowl. ``You knew he might say anything. He had been saying
things like that all week, he just didn't use the word guarantee.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Miami Touchdown Club voted to honor Namath, it didn't
know the Jets would be preparing for a Super Bowl that January
week. The honor was significant, as Namath was an American Football
League player receiving a ``professional football award'' when
National Football League stars were far more respected.
</P>
<P>
   The site was significant too: the Miami Springs Villas, on the
Glenn Curtiss estate. The Villas were part of 21 acres owned by the
jet-setting Arthur Bruns, host or dining partner to Mickey Mantle,
Adlai Stevenson, Arnold Palmer, Nikita Khrushchev and Dwight
Eisenhower. The Villas are gone, replaced by economy hotels, and
Bruns died in 1996. But then, Bruns was a showman and, according to
Mary Ann Taylor, curator of the Miami Springs Historic Preservation
Society, the Villas were ``quite a showplace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the place to be,'' says Joe Walker, an original member
of the Miami Touchdown Club.
</P>
<P>
   The Touchdown Club was founded in 1960, primarily to support the
University of Miami. ``The Club was the thing to do, especially for
us ex-half-assed athletes,'' says Buster Ziegler, a longtime
member. ``By the time we got to the Club, we were always better
athletes than we ever were.''
</P>
<P>
   The Club was generally all-male, and often off-color, but women
were allowed to attend the banquet on Jan. 9, and many did.
</P>
<P>
   The question was: Would Namath? And would Ewbank let him?
</P>
<P>
   There is some dispute about who made sure Namath showed. Bill
Bruce, the emcee that night, says former player Tom Kelleher got
Ewbank's permission early in the week. Joe Hirsch _ Namath's New
York roommate and a longtime columnist for the Daily Racing Form _
says he called Ewbank, who asked that Namath return to the hotel by
midnight. Norris Anderson, a Club founder, says Hirsch ``lured
Namath with a couple of stewardesses; he could be had, you know,''
though Hirsch says only that he and Namath had ``two dates after
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Ramos, then and now the Jets' media relations director,
says he urged Namath to go. ``He was talking about not going to it,
because a lot of things were going on during Super Bowl week,''
Ramos says. ``It was the day off, and I said, `Joe, the only thing
about that _ if you told these people you are going to be there,
and they sold all these tickets to this event, and this is a great
honor because it was the first time they had an AFL player of the
year, you should go.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank Ramos is the one who twisted my arm and made me go,''
says Namath, who has a home in Tequesta. ``I would have rather
stayed at the hotel. It was a tremendous honor, it was an important
situation. I was probably wishing I was back in Fort Lauderdale
instead of south Miami, although I did get along well in south
Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the attraction of Namath's appearance: his flamboyance,
his unpredictability. With whom would he arrive? Flirt? Whom would
he praise? Insult? He had already perturbed many NFLers by stating
that Colts quarterback Earl Morrall wasn't as good as Daryle
Lamonica of the AFL's Oakland Raiders. On Sunday, he nearly got
into a barroom brawl with Colts kicker Lou Michaels . . . then
ended the night by dropping off Michaels at the Statler Hilton, the
Colts' hotel. On Monday, he slept through Photo Day, and was fined
$50.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, shortly after 6 p.m., the limousine arrived at Oakland
Park Boulevard and State Road A1A. The Galt Ocean Mile Hotel would
shut down in 1986, serve as a set for Revenge of the Nerds II in
1987 and as a fortress for FBI swat teams to practice raids, before
it was razed in 1993. In the 1970s, it was a hotspot, where Sid
Caesar and Guy Lombardo would perform, and the Yankees stayed
during spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Anderson accompanied Namath on the ride to the Villas, and
notes in Countdown to Super Bowl that the quarterback ``was sipping
Johnnie Walker Red out of a paper cup in the front seat of a
turquoise Cadillac sedan.''
</P>
<P>
   Namath was to share the spotlight that night with O.J. Simpson,
who had been named college football's best player. But Simpson was
on the West Coast and didn't show. Bruce says that during the next
year's banquet, he picked up the phone, pretending Simpson had
called, and said, ``No, O.J., you dumb SOB, that was last year.''
</P>
<P>
   The most famous dining room at the Villas was King Arthur's
Court, named for Bruns and decorated with a medieval theme
including eight elaborate murals. Anderson and others have reported
that the banquet was held there, but most of the Touchdown Club
members remember it being in the larger Playhouse, with cocktails
in the adjacent Florida Room.
</P>
<P>
   The dinner: prime rib. Of course. ``We would have prime ribs
that were bigger than the plate,'' Walker says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest prime rib you ever saw,'' Bruce says.
</P>
<P>
   For a big event. ``It was packed,'' Norris Anderson says.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were in the lounge, and some outside on the patio,''
says Bernie Rosen, then a cameraman for Miami's WTJV-4. ``(The
room) was set up for someone to speak.''
</P>
<P>
   Namath would receive the award from Milt Woodward, the AFL
president who had suggested he shave and cut his hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be the usual, `Thank you for this lovely
trophy,' '' Hirsch says. ``I guess everybody else did, too.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems everybody was watching him eat, and drink. ``You never
saw a more affable guy in your life,'' Bruce says. ``The woman who
was the head waiter, Nancy, asked for an autograph. He was putting
a piece of meat in his mouth, and put it back down. This guy was
such a charmer.''
</P>
<P>
   Others lived vicariously through his exploits and excesses.
Norris Anderson says he sat beside Namath, who ``had three Johnnie
Walker Reds.'' Walker says ``they were bringing him Johnnie Walker
Reds as fast as he could down them.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Anderson wrote that ``Namath leaned down every so often and
sipped Scotch out of a napkin-wrapped old-fashioned glass.'' Yet
Anderson says: ``He wasn't drunk. He was Joe. He had had a drink or
two. He wasn't drunk before or after. There were no women around
him that night. When he got back, we watched some film.''
</P>
<P>
   Namath espoused film work _ ``The one-eyed monster doesn't
lie.'' The monster convinced him he could attack the left side of
the Colts' defense, and his receivers could outrun their
cornerbacks. Especially if Baltimore was complacent. Says Colts
tight end John Mackey: ``We just believed we had to show up. We
announced a victory party Wednesday before the game, and we cut up
the playoff share at the pre-game meal.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Colts frolicked with their families and spoke of adding
extensions to their houses, Namath studied. ``He was very confident
that they were going to win that game,'' Dave Anderson says.
</P>
<P>
   And so he said so Thursday night, helping make the Miami
Touchdown Club one of the most famous clubs in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Versions differ on his words.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce says he told Namath that night his ``remarks so far have
been as welcome as a hernia at a weight-lifter's convention, but
it's about time you came up and defended yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Bruce, Namath said: ``I don't like banquets
usually, but tonight I'm having a lot of fun. You people are all
great, and I'm going to offer you this. I want you to sell your
car, cash in your insurance policies, take your money out of the
bank, and bet it on the Jets.'' Then, after an interruption, Joe
continued: ``Hey, wait, we're going to beat the Colts on Sunday. I
guarantee it.''
</P>
<P>
   Countdown to Super Bowl recalls the sequence and sentence a bit
differently: ``We're going to win Sunday, I guarantee you.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, it was exciting, especially to the media. ``Most of
the other sportswriters had already left when Namath made his
guarantee,'' says Deborah Evans, widow of Luther, whose story under
a banner Miami Herald headline appeared Friday morning, upsetting
Ewbank's breakfast. ``He came home and told me about it. He thought
he had a hold of something pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was Namath,'' Rosen says. ``The Broadway Joe fit him
perfectly. He was just a cocky, cocky, cocky individual.''
</P>
<P>
   And a prescient one.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we did was laugh,'' Mackey says. ``We thought it was a
joke. And that was the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By halftime, I can remember thinking back, `That crazy bastard
knew what he was talking about,' '' Walker says. ``I think they
might beat the Colts.''
</P>
<P>
   They did, 16-7. Guaranteed.
</P>

 &HT;    AS MONEY FLOWS TO MILITARY, REFORMERS SAY CUT WASTE FIRST
 &HT;    With MILITARY-DATA. For release Sunday, Jan. 31.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As President Clinton unveils his plans Monday for a
six-year, $110 billion budget increase to close a ``readiness gap''
in the military, some defense experts say much of the money could
be found by correcting mismanagement and waste.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been hearing clamoring in this town for more money for
defense,'' said Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, as he chaired a
hearing last fall to examine how Air Force personnel created phony
invoices and paid themselves nearly $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we put adequate controls on the money we have, there should
be no need for more defense spending,'' Grassley said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Peter DeFazio, a Democrat who monitors military spending,
said he fears the push for higher defense spending will relax the
demand for reform. ``Those of us who would like to see the Pentagon
live within its means are undercut by the president's proffer'' of
spending hikes, the California lawmaker said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   One private watchdog group warns that the influx of new dollars
into the Pentagon after a decade of cutbacks invites a new wave of
fraud, because the government has dramatically reduced its force of
auditors and investigators who monitor contracts and spending.
``Further cuts in oversight personnel must be halted,'' said Marcus
Corbin, defense specialist at the Project on Government Oversight.
</P>
<P>
   Among the money-saving reforms being urged:
</P>
<P>
   _ Close more military bases. This could cut costs by $2 billion
to $3 billion a year. The military chiefs are lobbying hard to cull
unneeded bases to fit a force that has shrunk to one-third of its
Cold War level, and the White House has said Clinton will propose
new rounds of closings for 2001 and 2005.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea of shutting down bases meets strong resistance in
Congress, where members want to preserve civilian support jobs in
their home districts. Republican members also bitterly remember the
last round of base closings in 1995, when Clinton made a campaign
promise to protect jobs at two of the bases listed for closure, in
the vote-rich states of California and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A federal study has predicted that the next major targets would
probably be maintenance depots, especially in Texas and California.
Earlier base closings shut down more than 70 installations, and the
new rounds could add 40 more to the list.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fiscal management. The Defense Department keeps such poor
track of where its money goes that last year it reported $22
billion in so-called ``problem disbursements,'' payments made
without proper documentation. The amount was only slightly less
than prior years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we pay for goods and services, we sometimes have no idea
if we got what we paid for,'' Grassley said as he described the
Defense Department's huge bill-paying operations, which sends out
checks at a rate of $1.1 billion each day.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many signs of missing safeguards, the Defense
bill-paying center at Kettering, Ohio, gave Air Force Staff Sgt.
Robert L. Miller Jr. authority over billions of dollars, even after
an investigation tied him to missing checks. Over two years, Miller
faked invoices and paid himself $435,000 before he was caught.
</P>
<P>
   The case was one of several in which military employees have set
up phony companies and siphoned off millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. General Accounting Office, the investigating arm of
Congress, last week listed the military's contracting payment
system as well as most of its fiscal oversight as ``high-risk''
areas for fraud and waste.
</P>
<P>
   _ Scale back new weaponry. ``The Pentagon has confused the need
to re-equip the force with buying the fanciest gadgets,'' said
Michael O'Hanlon, a defense budget expert and author of ``How to Be
a Cheap Hawk.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Hanlon is advising that the Pentagon develop weapons already
on the drawing boards, but buy fewer of them. He cites the F-22, an
advanced fighter plane, which was first envisioned when the Soviet
Union was still a threat. Now that no foreign-built fighter can
come close to rivaling the F-22, O'Hanlon suggests buying far fewer
than the planned 339 aircraft, to be built by Lockheed Martin at an
estimated at $110 million apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Others point to Trident submarines, which patrol the world's
oceans carrying intercontinental nuclear missiles. The United
States could save $500 million a year by decommissioning four of
the 18 submarines, as called for in the SALT II treaty with Russia,
an idea that the Navy has embraced. Unless the four oldest Tridents
are scrapped, they will be soon be due for costly refurbishing.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Russian legislature has yet to ratify the treaty,
so the full Cold War complement of Tridents continues in service,
because the Clinton administration and many in Congress have been
unwilling to move until Russia does.
</P>
<P>
   Other defense experts, led by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., focus
on weaponry that members of Congress force the Pentagon to buy. He
cites the C-130J transport plane, long a favorite of lawmakers and
their local National Guard units.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three years, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich,
R-Ga., cleared the way to buy 20 of the transports, which are built
at a cost of $50 million apiece by Lockheed Martin in his home town
of Marietta. The Pentagon made no request for the transports.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Lockheed defends the C-130J's as ``a matter of
cost-effectiveness and readiness,'' since they are replacing 30- to
35-year-old models that cost more to fly and maintain. The new
planes can be flown by two pilots instead of four and carry more
cargo at a higher speed, said Lockheed spokesman Doug Oliver.
</P>
<P>
   As for the flashy F-22 ``Raptor,'' the manufacturer argues that
the per-plane cost will rise if fewer are built. And despite the
lack of a foreign rival for the high-tech fighter, Lockheed
spokesman Jim Fetig said, ``The F-22 gives the Air Force
unparalleled advantage against a range of threats that includes
airplanes and surface-to-air missiles.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Privatizing support services. The Defense Department should
make ``revolutionary'' changes to save nearly $30 billion a year by
privatizing non-defense work such as payroll, property disposal,
housing and medical care, according to Business Executives for
National Security.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Defense Department has embraced the idea of
finding business partners to help resolve its enormous housing
problem. Two-thirds of the military's 300,000 family housing units
are in need of repair or replacement at a cost estimated at $20
billion.
</P>
<P>
   But after several attempts to forge partnerships with private
developers, only two projects have been finished, one in Corpus
Christi, Texas, and another in Everett, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been slow,'' acknowledged Glenn Flood, a Pentagon
spokesman. He said the Defense Department would continue the effort
to work with private developers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cutting inventory. As of 1997, the military had about $41
billion worth of spare parts, medical supplies, and clothing _ even
sneakers _ that were obsolete or rarely used, all stockpiled in 164
warehouses worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Although the military has gradually disposed of the excess
materiel, the effort has been a money-loser. In recent efforts, the
department got only about 2.7 cents per each dollar of the original
price, although other government surplus sales earn more than
double that amount. Reformers have called on the Pentagon to hire
private contractors to clear out the stockpiles.

   ``On the morning of Dec. 10, 1996, I awoke with a pulsing pain
behind my left eye,'' writes neuroscientist Jill Bolte Taylor. ``I
got up to begin my morning routine and jumped onto my
cardio-glider. The exercise, I thought, would banish the throbbing
inside my head.'' But when she stopped exercising, she knew
something was wrong. ``When I held my hands up in front of my face,
I felt as though my consciousness was suspended somewhere between
normal reality and some esoteric space ... Time seemed to stand
still. I was disturbingly aware that the intricate networks that
operate the different functions of my mind were shutting down. I
tried to visualize myself driving to work, and in the next instant
my right arm went totally dead. In that moment I knew I was having
a stroke.'' Bolte Taylor describes in detail the events of that day
-- and how her life had changed.

   ``On the morning of Dec. 10, 1996, I awoke with a pulsing pain
behind my left eye,'' writes neuroscientist Jill Bolte Taylor. ``I
got up to begin my morning routine and jumped onto my
cardio-glider. The exercise, I thought, would banish the throbbing
inside my head.'' But when she stopped exercising, she knew
something was wrong. ``When I held my hands up in front of my face,
I felt as though my consciousness was suspended somewhere between
normal reality and some esoteric space ... Time seemed to stand
still. I was disturbingly aware that the intricate networks that
operate the different functions of my mind were shutting down. I
tried to visualize myself driving to work, and in the next instant
my right arm went totally dead. In that moment I knew I was having
a stroke.'' Bolte Taylor describes in detail the events of that day
-- and how her life had changed.

   Twenty-six years after man last set foot on the moon, a
grassroots movement is now under way to go back. Alan Binder, a
planetary scientist turned entrepreneur, wants to start factories
on the moon, churning out hydrogen or basalt bricks: the moon as
industrial park. David Gump, the former publisher of a
space-industry newsletter who has founded LunaCorp, wants to build
a moon rover with ``telepresence,'' which would be controlled from
Earth via joystick _ preferably by an adolescent in an arcade in an
amusement park somewhere. Should we study the moon, strip-mine it
or turn it into a theme park? Fred Guterl, a senior editor of
Discover magazine, reports.

   Advances in medical technology have created a marketplace for
everything from organs and tissues to genes and sex cells. Prices
vary: $300 for a pint of plasma, $50 for a sample of sperm, $10,000
for a nine-month lease on a surrogate mother's womb. Blood was the
first commodity on the market, and it is still the most commonly
sold body product. Paid blood donors typically earn from $50 to
$500 per pint; those with rare blood types or components may get
more. Think of it as a commodities market for the 21st century,
reports free-lance writer and editor Karen Wright.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Shortly after the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
was formed in 1958, its engineers began visiting elementary schools
in the leafy suburbs of Washington, D.C., to practice inspirational
speeches in front of kids.
</P>
<P>
   The space program hadn't yet hardened into a race against the
Soviets. It was still pictured as a journey of exploration, one
that would eventually lead to colonizing first the moon, then Mars
and the rest of the solar system. At least, that's the way Gregory
Bennett remembers the message the NASA guy gave to his third-grade
class.
</P>
<P>
   From that day on, Bennett was wedded to the space program.
</P>
<P>
   Now in his late 40s, Bennett is an employee of Boeing, NASA's
primary contractor for the International Space Station. On evenings
and weekends, Bennett is one of the leaders of what you might call
a lunar underground, a group called the Artemis Society, which is
bent on circumventing the politics and bureaucracy of NASA and
striking out on its own for the moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure we can put a man on the moon for about $1.5
billion,'' he says matter-of-factly. After an awkward silence, he
adds: ``We're going to do it. We are going to the moon.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett and his cohorts are not the only ones packing their
bags. Suddenly just about everybody is trying to get to the moon,
including a motley collection of entrepreneurs and dreamers in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, that is, except NASA: They have their hands full with
the space station, and their eyes cast in the direction of Mars.
</P>
<P>
   With NASA on the sidelines, and with no Cold War in sight, those
listening to Bennett's pitch could be forgiven for wondering how a
new lunar program might be structured and who, in this day of
budget cuts and belt-tightening, would be willing to pay for it.
And why?
</P>
<P>
   Wendell Mendell attended the Twenty-Ninth Lunar and Planetary
Science Conference last March at the Johnson Space Center, as he
has attended just about every moon conference since the mid-1960s,
when he was a planetary scientist for the Apollo missions.
</P>
<P>
   Mendell still works for JSC's Planetary Science Branch, and he
is one of the leading advocates for putting people on the moon. He
also knows firsthand how difficult it is to get the lunar bandwagon
rolling.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the early 1980s, Mendell and his colleagues spurred
NASA-affiliated engineers and scientists to think about and plan a
return mission to the moon. The result was the first Lunar Base
Symposium in Washington in 1984. Momentum flagged after the
Challenger explosion in 1986 but picked up again in 1989 when
President Bush made a Kennedyesque speech challenging NASA to go to
Mars.
</P>
<P>
   NASA responded with a 30-year plan that used the space station
and the moon as starting points. Unfortunately, the price tag _
$500 billion to $600 billion _ triggered the gag reflex in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But Mendell has quietly continued to plug the moon, writing
articles such as ``Lunar Base _ Why Ask Why?'' He wants to go not
for national pride but for another equally old-fashioned reason:
knowledge. The moon has much to teach us, he says, about the
origins of the solar system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moon is a geologic time machine,'' he says. ``It underwent
some of the processes that Earth underwent, but then it just
stopped. It is a record of the early days of the solar system, just
waiting to be read.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in January, only weeks before the Lunar and Planetary
Science Conference convened, the Lunar Prospector orbiter had
arrived in lunar orbit and started making detailed maps of the
surface. The biggest jewel in a treasure trove of scientific data
was the first incontrovertible evidence of water on the moon _
about a billion tons of it.
</P>
<P>
   Water on the moon has given the lunar underground a fillip.
``Primarily, the existence of water opens people's minds to going
to the moon,'' Alan Binder says. ``It's like finding gold.
California could have been settled without the gold rush, but it
sure helped.''
</P>
<P>
   A planetary scientist turned entrepreneur, Binder was the
driving force behind the scrappy, 650-pound Prospector orbiter.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Binder wants to start factories on the moon,
churning out hydrogen or basalt bricks. He's not talking about a
moon base but a whole industrial infrastructure in space _ the moon
as industrial park.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's LunaCorp, a private firm cofounded by David Gump,
the former publisher of a space-industry newsletter, who wants to
build a moon rover with ``telepresence,'' which would be controlled
from Earth via joystick _ preferably by an adolescent in an arcade
in an amusement park somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody thinks bigger than Greg Bennett, though, when it comes to
mining the moon's entertainment resources. In his vision, tourism
is the sine qua non of the development of the moon, and the entire
solar system for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting people up there would cost, oh, maybe $100,000 per
person,'' Bennett says. ``It'd be like a luxury capital tour of
Europe. It's about what you'd spend to go to Mount Everest. If you
had a resort on the northeast corner of Mare Crisium, there's a
place called Angus Bay where you could go spelunking.'' Bennett
envisions a network of gondola chairs that would take people around
to the most interesting sights.
</P>
<P>
   Which way will prevail on the moon? Mining or tourism?
Production or consumption? Although nobody is even close to leaving
Earth, already it seems clear that the final arbiter of what we
should do with the moon will most likely be the free market. If the
coming decades are anything like this one, don't count
entertainment out.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Shortly after the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
was formed in 1958, its engineers began visiting elementary schools
in the leafy suburbs of Washington, D.C., to practice inspirational
speeches in front of kids.
</P>
<P>
   The space program hadn't yet hardened into a race against the
Soviets. It was still pictured as a journey of exploration, one
that would eventually lead to colonizing first the moon, then Mars
and the rest of the solar system. At least, that's the way Gregory
Bennett remembers the message the NASA guy gave to his third-grade
class.
</P>
<P>
   From that day on, Bennett was wedded to the space program.
</P>
<P>
   Now in his late 40s, Bennett is an employee of Boeing, NASA's
primary contractor for the International Space Station. On evenings
and weekends, Bennett is one of the leaders of what you might call
a lunar underground, a group called the Artemis Society, which is
bent on circumventing the politics and bureaucracy of NASA and
striking out on its own for the moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure we can put a man on the moon for about $1.5
billion,'' he says matter-of-factly. After an awkward silence, he
adds: ``We're going to do it. We are going to the moon.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett and his cohorts are not the only ones packing their
bags. Suddenly just about everybody is trying to get to the moon,
including a motley collection of entrepreneurs and dreamers in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, that is, except NASA: They have their hands full with
the space station, and their eyes cast in the direction of Mars.
</P>
<P>
   With NASA on the sidelines, and with no Cold War in sight, those
listening to Bennett's pitch could be forgiven for wondering how a
new lunar program might be structured and who, in this day of
budget cuts and belt-tightening, would be willing to pay for it.
And why?
</P>
<P>
   Wendell Mendell attended the Twenty-Ninth Lunar and Planetary
Science Conference last March at the Johnson Space Center, as he
has attended just about every moon conference since the mid-1960s,
when he was a planetary scientist for the Apollo missions.
</P>
<P>
   Mendell still works for JSC's Planetary Science Branch, and he
is one of the leading advocates for putting people on the moon. He

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   There's a bank in central Boston that offers its customers a
unique investment opportunity. For an initial outlay of $2,500 and
yearly fees of $95, investors can realize returns of incalculable
value _ or, more often, no returns at all.
</P>
<P>
   The institution in question is Viacord, the nation's largest
commercial banker of blood from fetal umbilical cords. In recent
years cord blood has become something of a hot commodity, as
medical research has demonstrated its potential for treating
leukemia and certain immune disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Private bankers like Viacord can guarantee expectant parents
future access to their own baby's blood, thereby increasing the
likelihood of a match should the child or a relative someday need
to restore a crippled immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Viacord's 1,400-plus samples of frozen cord blood could
represent roughly $3.5 million in revenue for the company. But no
one knows what cord blood will be worth to the families who have
paid to keep it.
</P>
<P>
   Advances in medical technology have created a marketplace for
everything from organs and tissues to genes and sex cells. Prices
vary: $300 for a pint of plasma, $50 for a sample of sperm, $10,000
for a nine-month lease on a surrogate mother's womb.
</P>
<P>
   Blood was the first commodity on the market, and it is still the
most commonly sold body product. Paid blood donors typically earn
from $50 to $500 per pint; those with rare blood types or
components may get more.
</P>
<P>
   The League of Red Cross Societies and other international
organizations have expressed concern that the financial incentives
offered by the blood trade constitute a subtle form of coercion for
impoverished or otherwise disadvantaged groups.
</P>
<P>
   But concerns about donor exploitation have not succeeded in
halting blood buying and selling. Part of the reason may be that,
in legal terms as well as popular perception, blood is more a body
``product'' than a body ``part.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. National Organ Transplant Act (NOTA), which in 1984
banned interstate commerce in organs for transplant, specifically
excluded ``replenishable tissues such as blood or sperm'' from its
prohibitions.
</P>
<P>
   NOTA was passed in response to the transplant successes of the
late 1970s. Before the transplant act, there were cases of would-be
donors advertising for potential buyers, and of organ brokers
offering to match the two in exchange for a piece of the action.
</P>
<P>
   While NOTA has shut down organ brokers here, however,
unregulated _ and poorly documented _ markets for organs are
believed to flourish elsewhere, mostly in India and Brazil. And
while the act prohibits traffic in organs for transplantation, it
allows such commerce if the body parts in question are to be used
in research or product development and testing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984 businessman John Moore sued his doctor, the University
of California and several pharmaceutical companies for using,
without his consent, tissue from his cancerous spleen to create a
commercial cell line now valued by some at $3 billion in potential
profits. Moore lost.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990 the California Supreme Court ruled that patients do not
have property rights to their tissues, since granting such rights
would ``destroy the economic incentive to conduct important medical
research.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The next of kin have a lot more authority over your dead body
than you have over your live body,'' says George Annas, professor
of health law at the Boston University School of Public Health.
There are laws protecting the inviolability of cadavers but almost
none to protect what happens to tissues and organs removed from a
patient who's still alive.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most complicated issues in body-shop policy is the
traffic in fetal parts, which are gleaned almost exclusively from
fetuses that have been electively aborted. (Miscarried or stillborn
fetuses tend to have defects and are harder to harvest).
</P>
<P>
   Fetal tissue has been a prized medical resource ever since
research demonstrated its potential for treating Parkinson's
disease, diabetes and Alzheimer's, as well as spinal-cord injuries
and hemophilia. Combined markets for cures of these diseases have
been estimated at more than $6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But when a company began in the mid-1980s to develop a treatment
involving transplanted fetal cells, right-to-life protests erupted,
and in 1988 Congress passed the only amendment to NOTA, extending
the act's restrictions to include fetal organs and tissues. Of
course, fetal body parts are still being collected for use in
research.
</P>
<P>
   Another segment of the body-parts market prices the goods and
services for assisted reproduction. At present, money can buy sperm
($50 to $100), eggs (starting at $2,000), embryos (market value
varies), and a place to put them (gestational surrogates start at
$10,000, not including brokers' fees).
</P>
<P>
   The story of cord-blood banking may present an object lesson in
commercialization, though the moral of the story is not quite
clear.
</P>
<P>
   At least one expert has predicted that the average person's
chance of ever needing to use the blood banked is 1 in 200,000.
Nevertheless, the idea of cord-blood banking seems to be taking
off. More than a dozen companies, in addition to Viacord, now offer
banking services.
</P>
<P>
   And people are buying. At first, Viacord's customers were mostly
families who had a present or foreseeable need for stem-cell
transplants. Now more than half of Viacord's families have no
apparent need for the blood at all.
</P>
<P>
   Champions of cord-blood banking maintain that they have turned a
medical waste product into a valuable resource. But critics of the
trafficking in human anatomy claim that no matter how many lives
are saved (or created), any such commerce inevitably violates the
sanctity of the human body.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, animals engineered with human genes and
tissues have already been patented. The Thirteenth Amendment to the
Constitution, which outlawed slavery, would seem to prohibit the
patenting of a human being.
</P>
<P>
   But when does a human part, or a part-human, become a
full-fledged person? The ever-expanding scope of biomedical
commerce is forcing answers to such improbable questions. As the
market races forward, issues that were once the province of the
very ill or the very thoughtful may soon become every body's
business.

families who had a present or foreseeable need for stem-cell
transplants. Now more than half of Viacord's families have no
apparent need for the blood at all.
</P>
<P>
   Champions of cord-blood banking maintain that they have turned a
medical waste product into a valuable resource. But critics of the
trafficking in human anatomy claim that no matter how many lives
are saved (or created), any such commerce inevitably violates the
sanctity of the human body.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, animals engineered with human genes and
tissues have already been patented. The Thirteenth Amendment to the
Constitution, which outlawed slavery, would seem to prohibit the
patenting of a human being.
</P>
<P>
   But when does a human part, or a part-human, become a
full-fledged person? The ever-expanding scope of biomedical
commerce is forcing answers to such improbable questions. As the
market races forward, issues that were once the province of the
very ill or the very thoughtful may soon become every body's
business.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   On the morning of Dec. 10, 1996, I awoke with a pulsing pain
behind my left eye. I got up to begin my morning routine and jumped
onto my cardio-glider. The exercise, I thought, would get my blood
flowing and banish the throbbing inside my head.
</P>
<P>
   While I exercised, however, the pain became more intense. Within
a few moments I started to feel very peculiar _ confused, yet
clearheaded and alert.
</P>
<P>
   When I got off the machine, I noticed that I was slightly off
balance and feeling strangely detached from my body. I climbed into
the shower, my movements slowed and deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   When I held my hands up in front of my face, I felt as though my
consciousness was suspended somewhere between normal reality and
some esoteric space. The running water of the shower felt like
little bullets spattering into my flesh.
</P>
<P>
   I knew something was very wrong with my brain. I dimmed the
lights, because they made the throbbing behind my left eye worse.
</P>
<P>
   Time seemed to stand still. I was disturbingly aware that the
intricate networks that operate the different functions of my mind
were shutting down.
</P>
<P>
   I tried to visualize myself driving to work, and in the next
instant my right arm went totally dead.
</P>
<P>
   In that moment I knew I was having a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   I was 37 years old and, testifying to the impact of my
scientific training, my next thought was ``Wow, this is so cool!''
I am a trained neuroanatomist, and this was an opportunity for me
to study my brain _ from the inside out.
</P>
<P>
   I witnessed the breakdown of my higher cognitive skills. I could
no longer integrate and associate my thoughts with the incoming
sensory information.
</P>
<P>
   Although I felt no sense of urgency, I understood that the
prognosis of stroke is often determined by how quickly a patient
gets to the hospital. To save my life, I had to make a plan and
then consciously hold it in my memory long enough to execute it.
But I kept forgetting what it was I was trying to do.
</P>
<P>
   After minutes of effort, I dialed the phone number of the
Harvard Brain Bank at McLean Hospital, where I worked. I tried to
ask for help, but my throat wouldn't form the words. I simply
grunted.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually I blurted something out, but it was unintelligible. I
heard my colleague speaking, and I knew that I knew what was being
said, but I couldn't grasp the meaning. Fortunately, he sensed the
danger of my condition and assured me that he would send help.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long before I found myself at the hospital and in a CT
scanner. The resulting images revealed that I was indeed having a
stroke, with severe bleeding in my left temporal lobe.
</P>
<P>
   Later I learned that 10 percent of people who experience this
kind of stroke die immediately. Another 50 percent remain in a
vegetative state.
</P>
<P>
   Most strokes are caused when a blood clot lodges in an artery
that is supplying life-giving oxygen-rich blood to the brain. The
artery that is blocked determines which cells will be starved and
die. For some people there is extensive neurological destruction,
while for others there is minimal effect.
</P>
<P>
   My stroke, however, was not caused by a clot but by an
arteriovenous malformation (AVM). Normally, capillary networks _
fine-mesh structures of tiny blood vessels _ function as a buffer
zone between sturdy arteries, in which blood flows forcefully, and
thin-walled veins, which return blood to the heart and lungs. With
an AVM, there is a shortcut between arteries and veins, and a
low-pressure vein is directly hooked up to a high-pressure artery.
</P>
<P>
   Some people have the condition and never have symptoms. But in
others the direct connection between the artery and the vein
becomes so weak that the connection bursts.
</P>
<P>
   In my case, the hemorrhage occurred over a fold in the left
hemisphere of my brain: the superior temporal gyrus.
</P>
<P>
   The bleeding in my brain placed pressure on certain nerve
fibers, blocking my ability to speak or understand spoken language.
The most lasting injury occurred in a nearby region that allows for
the performance of both simple and complex mathematical
calculations.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the afternoon I regained full consciousness and
discovered I was completely mentally disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen days after the stroke, I underwent brain surgery at
Massachusetts General Hospital. The brain swelling from the
hemorrhage had receded, but my doctors needed to open my skull and
remove the affected tissue and residual debris.
</P>
<P>
   When I awoke from surgery, I faced the challenge of rebuilding
my brain. A small amount of tissue had been permanently destroyed.
Neuronal connections that had been broken by the injury would have
to be reconnected, and in some cases I would have to build entirely
new pathways.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the marvels of the brain that neurons can be
recruited to take on new functions. The recovery would not be
swift: It would be two years before we would know how well I would
recover from both the stroke and the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Some tasks came back more easily than others. Although I could
remember what it felt like to do simple things like walking
smoothly, my body wouldn't cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   But I could visualize how I did things before. And I believed
that if I held on to the memory of what it felt like to perform
basic actions, I could more quickly reestablish the connections
that had been broken before they completely deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two years have passed since my stroke. Besides having a
beauty of a scar, I still have some cognitive impairment. I can
handle only elementary mathematical calculations, and when I'm
tired I have trouble finding the right word.
</P>
<P>
   I have also shifted away from being a superanalytical, confident
risk taker who relied on the analytical skills housed in my brain's
left hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Instead I experienced a fascinating and pleasurable shift in my
perspective. My brain's right hemisphere is now dominant. I am much
more mellow and secure in my understanding of who I am and what I
want to accomplish with the finite time I have.
</P>
<P>
   I have crossed the bridge from the academic description of
illness to personal insight, and my resolve is stronger than ever.
Now I enjoy helping people understand what it is like to experience
mental deterioration.
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, I have great compassion.

 By FRED GUTERL  
 c.1999 Discover magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Shortly after the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
was formed in 1958, its engineers began visiting elementary schools
in the leafy suburbs of Washington, D.C., to practice inspirational
speeches in front of kids.
</P>
<P>
   The space program hadn't yet hardened into a race against the
Soviets. It was still pictured as a journey of exploration, one
that would eventually lead to colonizing first the moon, then Mars
and the rest of the solar system. At least, that's the way Gregory
Bennett remembers the message the NASA guy gave to his third-grade
class.
</P>
<P>
   From that day on, Bennett was wedded to the space program.
</P>
<P>
   Now in his late 40s, Bennett is an employee of Boeing, NASA's
primary contractor for the International Space Station. On evenings
and weekends, Bennett is one of the leaders of what you might call
a lunar underground, a group called the Artemis Society, which is
bent on circumventing the politics and bureaucracy of NASA and
striking out on its own for the moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure we can put a man on the moon for about $1.5
billion,'' he says matter-of-factly. After an awkward silence, he
adds: ``We're going to do it. We are going to the moon.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett and his cohorts are not the only ones packing their
bags. Suddenly just about everybody is trying to get to the moon,
including a motley collection of entrepreneurs and dreamers in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, that is, except NASA: They have their hands full with
the space station, and their eyes cast in the direction of Mars.
</P>
<P>
   With NASA on the sidelines, and with no Cold War in sight, those
listening to Bennett's pitch could be forgiven for wondering how a
new lunar program might be structured and who, in this day of
budget cuts and belt-tightening, would be willing to pay for it.
And why?
</P>
<P>
   Wendell Mendell attended the Twenty-Ninth Lunar and Planetary
Science Conference last March at the Johnson Space Center, as he
has attended just about every moon conference since the mid-1960s,
when he was a planetary scientist for the Apollo missions.
</P>
<P>
   Mendell still works for JSC's Planetary Science Branch, and he
is one of the leading advocates for putting people on the moon. He
also knows firsthand how difficult it is to get the lunar bandwagon
rolling.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the early 1980s, Mendell and his colleagues spurred
NASA-affiliated engineers and scientists to think about and plan a
return mission to the moon. The result was the first Lunar Base
Symposium in Washington in 1984. Momentum flagged after the
Challenger explosion in 1986 but picked up again in 1989 when
President Bush made a Kennedyesque speech challenging NASA to go to
Mars.
</P>
<P>
   NASA responded with a 30-year plan that used the space station
and the moon as starting points. Unfortunately, the price tag _
$500 billion to $600 billion _ triggered the gag reflex in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But Mendell has quietly continued to plug the moon, writing
articles such as ``Lunar Base _ Why Ask Why?'' He wants to go not
for national pride but for another equally old-fashioned reason:
knowledge. The moon has much to teach us, he says, about the
origins of the solar system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moon is a geologic time machine,'' he says. ``It underwent
some of the processes that Earth underwent, but then it just
stopped. It is a record of the early days of the solar system, just
waiting to be read.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in January, only weeks before the Lunar and Planetary
Science Conference convened, the Lunar Prospector orbiter had
arrived in lunar orbit and started making detailed maps of the
surface. The biggest jewel in a treasure trove of scientific data
was the first incontrovertible evidence of water on the moon _
about a billion tons of it.
</P>
<P>
   Water on the moon has given the lunar underground a fillip.
``Primarily, the existence of water opens people's minds to going
to the moon,'' Alan Binder says. ``It's like finding gold.
California could have been settled without the gold rush, but it
sure helped.''
</P>
<P>
   A planetary scientist turned entrepreneur, Binder was the
driving force behind the scrappy, 650-pound Prospector orbiter.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Binder wants to start factories on the moon,
churning out hydrogen or basalt bricks. He's not talking about a
moon base but a whole industrial infrastructure in space _ the moon
as industrial park.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's LunaCorp, a private firm cofounded by David Gump,
the former publisher of a space-industry newsletter, who wants to
build a moon rover with ``telepresence,'' which would be controlled
from Earth via joystick _ preferably by an adolescent in an arcade
in an amusement park somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody thinks bigger than Greg Bennett, though, when it comes to
mining the moon's entertainment resources. In his vision, tourism
is the sine qua non of the development of the moon, and the entire
solar system for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting people up there would cost, oh, maybe $100,000 per
person,'' Bennett says. ``It'd be like a luxury capital tour of
Europe. It's about what you'd spend to go to Mount Everest. If you
had a resort on the northeast corner of Mare Crisium, there's a
place called Angus Bay where you could go spelunking.'' Bennett
envisions a network of gondola chairs that would take people around
to the most interesting sights.
</P>
<P>
   Which way will prevail on the moon? Mining or tourism?
Production or consumption? Although nobody is even close to leaving
Earth, already it seems clear that the final arbiter of what we
should do with the moon will most likely be the free market. If the
coming decades are anything like this one, don't count
entertainment out.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Shortly after the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
was formed in 1958, its engineers began visiting elementary schools
in the leafy suburbs of Washington, D.C., to practice inspirational
speeches in front of kids.
</P>
<P>
   The space program hadn't yet hardened into a race against the
Soviets. It was still pictured as a journey of exploration, one
that would eventually lead to colonizing first the moon, then Mars
and the rest of the solar system. At least, that's the way Gregory
Bennett remembers the message the NASA guy gave to his third-grade
class.
</P>
<P>
   From that day on, Bennett was wedded to the space program.
</P>
<P>
   Now in his late 40s, Bennett is an employee of Boeing, NASA's
primary contractor for the International Space Station. On evenings
and weekends, Bennett is one of the leaders of what you might call
a lunar underground, a group called the Artemis Society, which is
bent on circumventing the politics and bureaucracy of NASA and
striking out on its own for the moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure we can put a man on the moon for about $1.5
billion,'' he says matter-of-factly. After an awkward silence, he
adds: ``We're going to do it. We are going to the moon.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett and his cohorts are not the only ones packing their
bags. Suddenly just about everybody is trying to get to the moon,
including a motley collection of entrepreneurs and dreamers in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, that is, except NASA: They have their hands full with
the space station, and their eyes cast in the direction of Mars.
</P>
<P>
   With NASA on the sidelines, and with no Cold War in sight, those
listening to Bennett's pitch could be forgiven for wondering how a
new lunar program might be structured and who, in this day of
budget cuts and belt-tightening, would be willing to pay for it.
And why?
</P>
<P>
   Wendell Mendell attended the Twenty-Ninth Lunar and Planetary
Science Conference last March at the Johnson Space Center, as he
has attended just about every moon conference since the mid-1960s,
when he was a planetary scientist for the Apollo missions.
</P>
<P>
   Mendell still works for JSC's Planetary Science Branch, and he
is one of the leading advocates for putting people on the moon. He
also knows firsthand how difficult it is to get the lunar bandwagon
rolling.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the early 1980s, Mendell and his colleagues spurred
NASA-affiliated engineers and scientists to think about and plan a
return mission to the moon. The result was the first Lunar Base
Symposium in Washington in 1984. Momentum flagged after the
Challenger explosion in 1986 but picked up again in 1989 when
President Bush made a Kennedyesque speech challenging NASA to go to
Mars.
</P>
<P>
   NASA responded with a 30-year plan that used the space station
and the moon as starting points. Unfortunately, the price tag _
$500 billion to $600 billion _ triggered the gag reflex in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But Mendell has quietly continued to plug the moon, writing
articles such as ``Lunar Base _ Why Ask Why?'' He wants to go not
for national pride but for another equally old-fashioned reason:
knowledge. The moon has much to teach us, he says, about the
origins of the solar system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moon is a geologic time machine,'' he says. ``It underwent
some of the processes that Earth underwent, but then it just
stopped. It is a record of the early days of the solar system, just
waiting to be read.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in January, only weeks before the Lunar and Planetary
Science Conference convened, the Lunar Prospector orbiter had
arrived in lunar orbit and started making detailed maps of the
surface. The biggest jewel in a treasure trove of scientific data
was the first incontrovertible evidence of water on the moon _
about a billion tons of it.
</P>
<P>
   Water on the moon has given the lunar underground a fillip.
``Primarily, the existence of water opens people's minds to going
to the moon,'' Alan Binder says. ``It's like finding gold.
California could have been settled without the gold rush, but it
sure helped.''
</P>
<P>
   A planetary scientist turned entrepreneur, Binder was the
driving force behind the scrappy, 650-pound Prospector orbiter.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Binder wants to start factories on the moon,
churning out hydrogen or basalt bricks. He's not talking about a
moon base but a whole industrial infrastructure in space _ the moon
as industrial park.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's LunaCorp, a private firm cofounded by David Gump,
the former publisher of a space-industry newsletter, who wants to
build a moon rover with ``telepresence,'' which would be controlled
from Earth via joystick _ preferably by an adolescent in an arcade
in an amusement park somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody thinks bigger than Greg Bennett, though, when it comes to
mining the moon's entertainment resources. In his vision, tourism
is the sine qua non of the development of the moon, and the entire
solar system for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting people up there would cost, oh, maybe $100,000 per
person,'' Bennett says. ``It'd be like a luxury capital tour of
Europe. It's about what you'd spend to go to Mount Everest. If you
had a resort on the northeast corner of Mare Crisium, there's a
place called Angus Bay where you could go spelunking.'' Bennett
envisions a network of gondola chairs that would take people around
to the most interesting sights.
</P>
<P>
   Which way will prevail on the moon? Mining or tourism?
Production or consumption? Although nobody is even close to leaving
Earth, already it seems clear that the final arbiter of what we
should do with the moon will most likely be the free market. If the
coming decades are anything like this one, don't count
entertainment out.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   There's a bank in central Boston that offers its customers a
unique investment opportunity. For an initial outlay of $2,500 and
yearly fees of $95, investors can realize returns of incalculable
value _ or, more often, no returns at all.
</P>
<P>
   The institution in question is Viacord, the nation's largest
commercial banker of blood from fetal umbilical cords. In recent
years cord blood has become something of a hot commodity, as
medical research has demonstrated its potential for treating
leukemia and certain immune disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Private bankers like Viacord can guarantee expectant parents
future access to their own baby's blood, thereby increasing the
likelihood of a match should the child or a relative someday need
to restore a crippled immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Viacord's 1,400-plus samples of frozen cord blood could
represent roughly $3.5 million in revenue for the company. But no
one knows what cord blood will be worth to the families who have
paid to keep it.
</P>
<P>
   Advances in medical technology have created a marketplace for
everything from organs and tissues to genes and sex cells. Prices
vary: $300 for a pint of plasma, $50 for a sample of sperm, $10,000
for a nine-month lease on a surrogate mother's womb.
</P>
<P>
   Blood was the first commodity on the market, and it is still the
most commonly sold body product. Paid blood donors typically earn
from $50 to $500 per pint; those with rare blood types or
components may get more.
</P>
<P>
   The League of Red Cross Societies and other international
organizations have expressed concern that the financial incentives
offered by the blood trade constitute a subtle form of coercion for
impoverished or otherwise disadvantaged groups.
</P>
<P>
   But concerns about donor exploitation have not succeeded in
halting blood buying and selling. Part of the reason may be that,
in legal terms as well as popular perception, blood is more a body
``product'' than a body ``part.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. National Organ Transplant Act (NOTA), which in 1984
banned interstate commerce in organs for transplant, specifically
excluded ``replenishable tissues such as blood or sperm'' from its
prohibitions.
</P>
<P>
   NOTA was passed in response to the transplant successes of the
late 1970s. Before the transplant act, there were cases of would-be
donors advertising for potential buyers, and of organ brokers
offering to match the two in exchange for a piece of the action.
</P>
<P>
   While NOTA has shut down organ brokers here, however,
unregulated _ and poorly documented _ markets for organs are
believed to flourish elsewhere, mostly in India and Brazil. And
while the act prohibits traffic in organs for transplantation, it
allows such commerce if the body parts in question are to be used
in research or product development and testing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984 businessman John Moore sued his doctor, the University
of California and several pharmaceutical companies for using,
without his consent, tissue from his cancerous spleen to create a
commercial cell line now valued by some at $3 billion in potential
profits. Moore lost.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990 the California Supreme Court ruled that patients do not
have property rights to their tissues, since granting such rights
would ``destroy the economic incentive to conduct important medical
research.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The next of kin have a lot more authority over your dead body
than you have over your live body,'' says George Annas, professor
of health law at the Boston University School of Public Health.
There are laws protecting the inviolability of cadavers but almost
none to protect what happens to tissues and organs removed from a
patient who's still alive.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most complicated issues in body-shop policy is the
traffic in fetal parts, which are gleaned almost exclusively from
fetuses that have been electively aborted. (Miscarried or stillborn
fetuses tend to have defects and are harder to harvest).
</P>
<P>
   Fetal tissue has been a prized medical resource ever since
research demonstrated its potential for treating Parkinson's
disease, diabetes and Alzheimer's, as well as spinal-cord injuries
and hemophilia. Combined markets for cures of these diseases have
been estimated at more than $6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But when a company began in the mid-1980s to develop a treatment
involving transplanted fetal cells, right-to-life protests erupted,
and in 1988 Congress passed the only amendment to NOTA, extending
the act's restrictions to include fetal organs and tissues. Of
course, fetal body parts are still being collected for use in
research.
</P>
<P>
   Another segment of the body-parts market prices the goods and
services for assisted reproduction. At present, money can buy sperm
($50 to $100), eggs (starting at $2,000), embryos (market value
varies), and a place to put them (gestational surrogates start at
$10,000, not including brokers' fees).
</P>
<P>
   The story of cord-blood banking may present an object lesson in
commercialization, though the moral of the story is not quite
clear.
</P>
<P>
   At least one expert has predicted that the average person's
chance of ever needing to use the blood banked is 1 in 200,000.
Nevertheless, the idea of cord-blood banking seems to be taking
off. More than a dozen companies, in addition to Viacord, now offer
banking services.
</P>
<P>
   And people are buying. At first, Viacord's customers were mostly
families who had a present or foreseeable need for stem-cell
transplants. Now more than half of Viacord's families have no
apparent need for the blood at all.
</P>
<P>
   Champions of cord-blood banking maintain that they have turned a
medical waste product into a valuable resource. But critics of the
trafficking in human anatomy claim that no matter how many lives
are saved (or created), any such commerce inevitably violates the
sanctity of the human body.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, animals engineered with human genes and
tissues have already been patented. The Thirteenth Amendment to the
Constitution, which outlawed slavery, would seem to prohibit the
patenting of a human being.
</P>
<P>
   But when does a human part, or a part-human, become a
full-fledged person? The ever-expanding scope of biomedical
commerce is forcing answers to such improbable questions. As the
market races forward, issues that were once the province of the
very ill or the very thoughtful may soon become every body's
business.

 By JILL BOLTE TAYLOR  
 c.1999 Discover magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   On the morning of Dec. 10, 1996, I awoke with a pulsing pain
behind my left eye. I got up to begin my morning routine and jumped
onto my cardio-glider. The exercise, I thought, would get my blood
flowing and banish the throbbing inside my head.
</P>
<P>
   While I exercised, however, the pain became more intense. Within
a few moments I started to feel very peculiar _ confused, yet
clearheaded and alert.
</P>
<P>
   When I got off the machine, I noticed that I was slightly off
balance and feeling strangely detached from my body. I climbed into
the shower, my movements slowed and deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   When I held my hands up in front of my face, I felt as though my
consciousness was suspended somewhere between normal reality and
some esoteric space. The running water of the shower felt like
little bullets spattering into my flesh.
</P>
<P>
   I knew something was very wrong with my brain. I dimmed the
lights, because they made the throbbing behind my left eye worse.
</P>
<P>
   Time seemed to stand still. I was disturbingly aware that the
intricate networks that operate the different functions of my mind
were shutting down.
</P>
<P>
   I tried to visualize myself driving to work, and in the next
instant my right arm went totally dead.
</P>
<P>
   In that moment I knew I was having a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   I was 37 years old and, testifying to the impact of my
scientific training, my next thought was ``Wow, this is so cool!''
I am a trained neuroanatomist, and this was an opportunity for me
to study my brain _ from the inside out.
</P>
<P>
   I witnessed the breakdown of my higher cognitive skills. I could
no longer integrate and associate my thoughts with the incoming
sensory information.
</P>
<P>
   Although I felt no sense of urgency, I understood that the
prognosis of stroke is often determined by how quickly a patient
gets to the hospital. To save my life, I had to make a plan and
then consciously hold it in my memory long enough to execute it.
But I kept forgetting what it was I was trying to do.
</P>
<P>
   After minutes of effort, I dialed the phone number of the
Harvard Brain Bank at McLean Hospital, where I worked. I tried to
ask for help, but my throat wouldn't form the words. I simply
grunted.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually I blurted something out, but it was unintelligible. I
heard my colleague speaking, and I knew that I knew what was being
said, but I couldn't grasp the meaning. Fortunately, he sensed the
danger of my condition and assured me that he would send help.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long before I found myself at the hospital and in a CT
scanner. The resulting images revealed that I was indeed having a
stroke, with severe bleeding in my left temporal lobe.
</P>
<P>
   Later I learned that 10 percent of people who experience this
kind of stroke die immediately. Another 50 percent remain in a
vegetative state.
</P>
<P>
   Most strokes are caused when a blood clot lodges in an artery
that is supplying life-giving oxygen-rich blood to the brain. The
artery that is blocked determines which cells will be starved and
die. For some people there is extensive neurological destruction,
while for others there is minimal effect.
</P>
<P>
   My stroke, however, was not caused by a clot but by an
arteriovenous malformation (AVM). Normally, capillary networks _
fine-mesh structures of tiny blood vessels _ function as a buffer
zone between sturdy arteries, in which blood flows forcefully, and
thin-walled veins, which return blood to the heart and lungs. With
an AVM, there is a shortcut between arteries and veins, and a
low-pressure vein is directly hooked up to a high-pressure artery.
</P>
<P>
   Some people have the condition and never have symptoms. But in
others the direct connection between the artery and the vein
becomes so weak that the connection bursts.
</P>
<P>
   In my case, the hemorrhage occurred over a fold in the left
hemisphere of my brain: the superior temporal gyrus.
</P>
<P>
   The bleeding in my brain placed pressure on certain nerve
fibers, blocking my ability to speak or understand spoken language.
The most lasting injury occurred in a nearby region that allows for
the performance of both simple and complex mathematical
calculations.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the afternoon I regained full consciousness and
discovered I was completely mentally disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen days after the stroke, I underwent brain surgery at
Massachusetts General Hospital. The brain swelling from the
hemorrhage had receded, but my doctors needed to open my skull and
remove the affected tissue and residual debris.
</P>
<P>
   When I awoke from surgery, I faced the challenge of rebuilding
my brain. A small amount of tissue had been permanently destroyed.
Neuronal connections that had been broken by the injury would have
to be reconnected, and in some cases I would have to build entirely
new pathways.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the marvels of the brain that neurons can be
recruited to take on new functions. The recovery would not be
swift: It would be two years before we would know how well I would
recover from both the stroke and the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Some tasks came back more easily than others. Although I could
remember what it felt like to do simple things like walking
smoothly, my body wouldn't cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   But I could visualize how I did things before. And I believed
that if I held on to the memory of what it felt like to perform
basic actions, I could more quickly reestablish the connections
that had been broken before they completely deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two years have passed since my stroke. Besides having a
beauty of a scar, I still have some cognitive impairment. I can
handle only elementary mathematical calculations, and when I'm
tired I have trouble finding the right word.
</P>
<P>
   I have also shifted away from being a superanalytical, confident
risk taker who relied on the analytical skills housed in my brain's
left hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Instead I experienced a fascinating and pleasurable shift in my
perspective. My brain's right hemisphere is now dominant. I am much
more mellow and secure in my understanding of who I am and what I
want to accomplish with the finite time I have.
</P>
<P>
   I have crossed the bridge from the academic description of
illness to personal insight, and my resolve is stronger than ever.
Now I enjoy helping people understand what it is like to experience
mental deterioration.
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, I have great compassion.

<P>
   On the morning of Dec. 10, 1996, I awoke with a pulsing pain
behind my left eye. I got up to begin my morning routine and jumped
onto my cardio-glider. The exercise, I thought, would get my blood
flowing and banish the throbbing inside my head.
</P>
<P>
   While I exercised, however, the pain became more intense. Within
a few moments I started to feel very peculiar _ confused, yet
clearheaded and alert.
</P>
<P>
   When I got off the machine, I noticed that I was slightly off
balance and feeling strangely detached from my body. I climbed into
the shower, my movements slowed and deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   When I held my hands up in front of my face, I felt as though my
consciousness was suspended somewhere between normal reality and
some esoteric space. The running water of the shower felt like
little bullets spattering into my flesh.
</P>
<P>
   I knew something was very wrong with my brain. I dimmed the
lights, because they made the throbbing behind my left eye worse.
</P>
<P>
   Time seemed to stand still. I was disturbingly aware that the
intricate networks that operate the different functions of my mind
were shutting down.
</P>
<P>
   I tried to visualize myself driving to work, and in the next
instant my right arm went totally dead.
</P>
<P>
   In that moment I knew I was having a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   I was 37 years old and, testifying to the impact of my
scientific training, my next thought was ``Wow, this is so cool!''
I am a trained neuroanatomist, and this was an opportunity for me
to study my brain _ from the inside out.
</P>
<P>
   I witnessed the breakdown of my higher cognitive skills. I could
no longer integrate and associate my thoughts with the incoming
sensory information.
</P>
<P>
   Although I felt no sense of urgency, I understood that the

 &HT;    Talkin' tall
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Mark Woods
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The goal is to find out what Denver Broncos tight end Shannon
Sharpe was like before he got to the NFL, before he had the nerve
to call Dan Marino ``a loser,'' before he baited Kansas City's
Derrick Thomas into a Monday Night meltdown, before he left a trail
of angry fans on the road to Super Bowl XXXIII.
</P>
<P>
   You start with calls to Savannah State, the Division II school
where Sharpe played college football. The people there decide to
play a practical joke on you. They tell you that you should talk to
his roommate for the final three years of college. They say his
name is Mike Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right. Mike Wallace. That's a good one. And who did he
room with freshman year? Morley Safer?
</P>
<P>
   Only it turns out to be true. This Mike Wallace now is offensive
coordinator at Savannah State. Back in the late '80s, he played
free safety and lived with Sharpe.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a great roommate,'' Wallace said.
</P>
<P>
   You wonder what Wallace's reaction was last Sunday when he
turned on the TV and saw his college buddy, the guy who grew up in
a rural Georgia town, wearing the Denver version of a Cheesehead _
a Bronco-head _ and mimicking a Bronx accent as he delivered a
post-game message to the New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fuggetaboudit.''
</P>
<P>
   Was Wallace shaking his head, amazed at how fame can take a
small-town kid and turn him into The Mouth That Scored?
</P>
<P>
   Hardly.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Shannon,'' Wallace said with a laugh. ``He never was
shy for words.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it turns out that fame hasn't changed Sharpe. It has
only turned him up a notch.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch Glicken, executive sports producer at WTOC-Channel 11 in
Savannah, recalls getting a call from the Denver CBS affiliate the
day the Broncos made Sharpe a seventh-round pick _ 192nd overall _
in the 1990 draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `Do you have any video of this kid?' '' Glicken
said.
</P>
<P>
   Once he stopped laughing, Glicken said, ``Do I have video? I've
got tons of it. I'll make you a deal. I'll send you some now if you
send me some on the first day of training camp.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal was struck. Then the first day of training camp came
and, Glicken says, the Denver affiliate said there was a problem.
They had spent their time at practice making sure to get shots of
other rookies. They hadn't gotten anything of Sharpe.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `He's not even going to make the team,' '' Glicken
said. ``I told them I'd call them back when he made the Pro Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   It took three years, but he made it. And he has been making it
every year since. Next month, he will make trip No. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers back up his talk
</P>
<P>
   He might be the best tight end in the NFL, a mix of speed and
size that gives defenses fits. But he might be best known for what
comes out of his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't your Flutie-is-short variety of trash talking. It's
as if Sharpe is trying to mix in a little something from one of his
favorite TV shows: Jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Geography for 100. What did Sharpe say moments after the Broncos
eliminated Pittsburgh from the playoffs last season?
</P>
<P>
   ``Stay away from the Allegheny, the Ohio and the Monongahela. I
hope they freeze those three rivers tonight, because I'd hate to
see anybody plunging to the bottom of them.''
</P>
<P>
   History for 200. What did Sharpe say a couple of years ago when,
after the Broncos took a 34-8 lead at New England, he picked up the
red telephone sitting behind the Denver bench in Foxboro?
</P>
<P>
   ``President! We need the National Guard! We need as many men as
you can spare, because we are killing the Patriots!''
</P>
<P>
   Travel plans for 300. What did Sharpe say following a 38-3
victory that eliminated the Dolphins and moved the Broncos within
one game of the Super Bowl?
</P>
<P>
   ``How does it feel to have the Super Bowl at your house, and
you're not invited?'' he said, adding a message for Dolphins coach
Jimmy Johnson. ``Tell Jimmy to have his office ready because we're
going to need to break down film.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, Super Bowl week is here. Sharpe and his teammates arrive
today. And, guess what, they will be staying in Fort Lauderdale and
using the Dolphins' training facility in Davie.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what kind of reception he expects, Sharpe told
reporters in Denver: ``I don't really think I'll be getting many
free meals.''
</P>
<P>
   The people who know Sharpe _ friends and family from Georgia _
worry that the rest of the nation is getting the wrong impression.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe might be the Super Bowl's brashest talker since Michael
Irvin, but please don't lump the two together.
</P>
<P>
   A quiet family? Say what?
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe's life doesn't read like an episode of Cops. His mother
made sure of that. She sent him and two older siblings _ Sterling
and Sherra _ away from the streets of Chicago to live with their
grandparents in a farmhouse a half mile from the nearest neighbor
in Glennville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good family,'' said William Hall, track coach at Tattnall
County (Ga.) High School.
</P>
<P>
   Hall should know. He has been coaching football and track in the
area for 38 years. He coached Shannon's older brother, Sterling. He
coached four of his uncles. And when asked if they all were as
talkative as Shannon, Hall laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said. ``Everyone else was quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the rest of the Sharpe family seems to try to avoid
attention. Sterling didn't talk to the media during his career with
Green Bay. And although he now is part of the media as a
broadcaster for ESPN, he didn't return calls for this story. And
their grandmother, who raised them after their grandfather died,
has an unlisted telephone number.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, there even is a quiet side to Shannon.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't drink. He doesn't smoke. He doesn't even go out that
much. When he does, he often chooses to sit in a dark theater and
watch a movie. And when he really wants to go crazy, well, he
watches more than one movie. He once sat through six in a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``People see me and say, `This is the guy that everyone says is
so funny and so talkative?' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That side comes out on the football field. Or in the weight
room. Or the locker room. Or seemingly anytime a microphone is
within shouting range.
</P>
<P>
   Hall recalls Sharpe once saying to him, ``You better hope
nothing happens to me, because if it does, the show stops.'' Hall
didn't get mad. He laughed, partly because he knew there was some
truth to it, but mainly because he knew Sharpe.
</P>
<P>
   He also knew Sharpe as a hard-working student who would end up
at Savannah State only because his test scores were low. Who was at
church every Sunday. Who never was in trouble. Who thought about
becoming a lawyer if football hadn't panned out. Who after winning
Super Bowl XXXII would take his ring and give it to his idol _
Sterling _ saying: ``Seeing my brother wear a Super Bowl ring means
more to me than having it on my own finger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's typical Shannon,'' said Bill Davis, his college coach
who now is at Johnson C. Smith University in Charlotte, N.C. ``Some
people try to distance themselves from their brothers. Not Shannon.
He wanted to be like Sterling. I can't say enough about him. He was
a joy to coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is Davis who should be blamed for Sharpe's constant
chatter. He always told his players that to succeed in life, they
had to be able to talk. Of course, he also told them they had to
think before they talked _ something Sharpe admits he doesn't do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just say what comes into my head,'' he said. ``It's not
planned.''
</P>
<P>
   A vocal leader
</P>
<P>
   Although some of those things make old friends cringe _ the
Marino comment, in particular _ his old friends don't want fame to
change him. For instance, Davis says he wishes he could clone that
personality and fill his team with it. He recalls asking Sharpe to
play quarterback for the scout team _ then scrapping the idea when
the scout team got so riled up that he feared the field would be
littered with injured players.
</P>
<P>
   That's the thing about Sharpe's talking. It might infuriate
others but it inspires those around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone feeds off him,'' Wallace said.
</P>
<P>
   Now Sharpe is bringing his feeding frenzy to Miami, a place he
almost ended up at 10 years ago. After his sophomore year at
Savannah State, he was offered a chance to jump ship, to play for a
national powerhouse at the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Think about that. Was there ever a player who seems like he
should have been a 1980s Hurricane?
</P>
<P>
   He thought about it but eventually decided to listen to advice
from Davis: ``Son, if you're good, they'll find you.''
</P>
<P>
   They did.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe made sure of that.

THE CASE FOR AN ALTERNATIVE SHAKESPEARE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   People tell me I must see ``Shakespeare in Love,'' and maybe I
will; but I've resisted it, confident that if I watch a
much-praised, well-scripted, well-photographed, well-acted movie, I
still won't believe a word of it.
</P>
<P>
   That's because I'm in the growing army of disbelievers in the
beloved Bard of Avon. I'll endeavor to chart the origin and
development of my disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   First, I must protest that I am not by nature a conspiracy
theorist. I believe Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in the
assassination of President John F. Kennedy, and I tend to dismiss
most other well-exploited conspiracy notions. Having said that, I
believe a conspiracy existed between one William Shakespeare, an
actor, and Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford and the true
author of the plays attributed to Shakespeare. So here goes.
</P>
<P>
   When I was enrolled in an upper-division undergraduate course in
Shakespeare at UCLA, I was shocked and appalled when the professor
_ a solidly credentialed Paul Jorgenson _ expressed belief that
Shakespeare was not the creator of Hamlet and Portia and Falstaff,
or of some of the loveliest sonnets in our language.
</P>
<P>
   As years passed, I grew ever more fascinated by the question of
authorship, read books and articles on the subject, became familiar
with claims for Francis Bacon, Christopher Marlowe, even Queen
Elizabeth I herself, all the while remaining faithful to the man
from Stratford. It seemed like petty snobbery that some people
believed Shakespeare incapable of writing the plays because of his
limited education and knowledge of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Oxford theory was gaining momentum. Dr. Jorgenson had
mentioned him as a possibility, although the earl was a late
starter in the authorship sweepstakes. Early in this century, a
scholar with the unfortunate surname of Looney proposed Oxford as
the authentic poet-dramatist. The basis of his claim was language,
and the argument is solid.
</P>
<P>
   In Shakespeare's time, there was no stability to the English
language _ Samuel Johnson's first great dictionary was almost two
centuries in the distance _ and there were hundreds of English
dialects and contrasting vocabularies. Stratford talk was far
removed from London talk, and it was unlikely that one come to
London as recently as Shakespeare would have had mastery of the
most elevated English speech, informed by the language of court.
</P>
<P>
   So I joined the opposition camp, a doubter of Shakespeare, but
also a doubter of Bacon, because Baconian language is not
Shakespearean. Nor is Marlovian language; and the theory of Marlowe
authorship is delightfully wild, with sure appeal for conspiracy
buffs. The notion is that Kit Marlowe _ Shakespeare's great
contemporary _ wasn't really killed in a tavern brawl at age 29,
but went into hiding with a price on his head and proceeded to
write plays that he slipped to Shakespeare surreptitiously.
</P>
<P>
   Charlton Ogburn's massive ``The Mysterious William
Shakespeare,'' published in the early 1980s, may be the nearest
thing to proof that Shakespeare couldn't and didn't write those
plays or any plays, any poems. Ogburn advanced the likelihood that
Shakespeare was illiterate, and that the four extant signatures
were made with a template. There is no witness to Shakespeare
having ever had pen or quill in hand.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatist who ``never blotted a line'' delivered plays
regularly to the Lord Chamberlain's Men for performance; and in his
leisure, Shakespeare lifted a glass with Ben Jonson and others at
the Mermaid Tavern, deceiving them all while playing his greatest
role.
</P>
<P>
   Ogburn's case against Shakespeare is stronger than his case for
Oxford _ which, however, is strong enough. I'm just getting warmed
up and will have more to say on this matter; meanwhile, if you've
been made curious, seek out Charlton Ogburn's ``The Mysterious
William Shakespeare'' and have some fun.

<P>
   Statistics tell the story, but teachers have known the plot for
a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Until age 9 or so, girls and boys make about the same scores on
science tests, according to data from the National Center for
Education Statistics. By age 13, however, the boys are outscoring
the girls.
</P>
<P>
   A similar gap in math scores has closed somewhat in recent
years, but still exists.
</P>
<P>
   Until the middle-school grades, girls and boys use home
computers for roughly equal amounts of time. Then, girls' computer
use drops off, while boys' use increases.
</P>
<P>
   In seventh grade, about as many girls say they enjoy science as
boys. By 12th grade, however, the boys who enjoy science far
outnumber the girls.
</P>
<P>
   And as early as the eighth grade, according to the National
Coalition of Girls' Schools, more boys than girls are considering
careers in science and engineering.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be a challenge, being the only girl in half your
classes,'' said Tameka Smith, a freshman at North Carolina State
University, who is aiming for an engineering degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girls feel pretty good about themselves until age 10 or so,''
said Grace Mae Burton, chairman of the department of curricular
studies in the Watson School of Education at the University of
North Carolina at Wilmington. ``Then something happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The gap was documented in a 1991 survey, Shortchanging Girls,
Shortchanging America, commissioned by the American Association of
University Women. As girls reach adolescence, the survey found,
they suffer a loss of self-esteem _ and a loss of interest in
science and mathematics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has a handle on why this happens,'' Burton said, but
clues abound.
</P>
<P>
   Follow-up studies funded by the AAUW found that curricula
stereotyped girls, that teachers called on boys more often for
answers or discussions, and that school counselors often seemed to
channel girls into traditionally ``feminine'' courses. For
African-American girls, the difficulties seemed particularly acute.
</P>
<P>
   Some studies suggest that girls may be more hampered than boys
by a fear of failure. On standardized tests, for instance, girls
are far more likely to respond ``I don't know,'' rather than try to
make an educated guess.
</P>
<P>
   How can the trend be countered?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to help young women see that they can do lots of
things,'' said Burton, ``that they don't have to stifle their
intelligence. We have to teach them to say, `Yes I can.'''
</P>
<P>
   This can be done partly by steering girls toward after-school
programs that stress sports, computers, math or manual skills, such
as Girls Inc.'s national SMART (Science, Math and Relevant
Technology) program, encouraging their competition in science fairs
and trade shows, and exposing them to a variety of careers,
including those occupied largely by men.
</P>
<P>
   In the SMART program, girls join in such projects as building
batteries from cups, kitchen bleach and other simple materials to
rigging electric switches or taking a radio apart to see how it
works.
</P>
<P>
   Recreational programs, including basketball, soccer and
softball, can have values beyond fitness. Studies show that girls
in organized athletics are less likely to become pregnant as
teen-agers or to get involved in drug abuse. Sports may also build
girls' confidence in dealing with competition.
</P>
<P>
   Burton, a specialist in math education, suggested that
traditional boys' games _ for instance, kicking and throwing balls
_ can hone skills in spatial perception, a key tool in dealing with
math. Girls' games on the other hand, promote communication skills.
This might explain why many girls excel in language arts but lag in
geometry and higher mathematics.
</P>
<P>
   Parents and families can do a lot to give girls confidence,
especially the confidence to tackle difficult subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom always told us, if it's worth having, it's worth
working for,'' said Smith, the N.C. State freshman.

<P>
   SIDEBAR: EXPERT ADVICE FOR PARENTS:
</P>
<P>
   _ Introduce books that help girls find role models beyond rock
singers and movie stars. Burton remembers as a young person,
reading biographies of scientists: ``What fascinated me was that
they didn't get their right answer the first time, but they kept
trying.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Helping girls learn about astronauts Sally Ride and Mae
Jemison, about Marie Curie, Rachel Carson, Jane Goodall and Amelia
Earhart, can give them positive examples.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you have a home computer, make sure daughters have as much
access as sons.
</P>
<P>
   _ Instill a spirit of independence. Allow children to make
choices, face consequences and learn to live with their
responsibilities. Problem-solving is a skill best mastered while
young.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When I told friends I was planning to go winter camping in the
High Sierra between California and Nevada, everyone was quick to
weigh in. I would freeze. People died in the back country in
winter. They got lost, took a misstep, were buried alive.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, winter camping raised lots of questions. But it also
resonated a simple thought. If everybody was inside waiting for
spring, outside it would be empty...
</P>
<P>
   That and curiosity were the main reasons I signed up for a
two-day snow camping and winter survival course. And how I came to
be sitting in a tidy bunkhouse high in the mountains above Lake
Tahoe, a 50-mile drive from Reno, listening to our mountain guide
make a point he would repeat again and again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about being prepared,'' said Brian Biega, a
26-year-old instructor with Alpine Skills International, a local
outfitter. ``A lot of staying comfortable in the winter is always
keeping on top of things and always thinking ahead. Otherwise all
of the sudden you wake up and you have a big frozen cube in your
pod.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether that cube might be your tentmate, Biega didn't say. Like
many experienced outdoor folk, Biega addressed the obvious and let
implication speak for itself. It would be his job to shepherd us
through two days and an overnight, while tutoring us in the bare
bones basics of avalanche detection, navigation, building a snow
cave and keeping our toes and fingers from turning into senseless
blocks.
</P>
<P>
   There were five of us in the group: the oldest was 51 and the
most experienced had done some back-country skiing. Just behind the
lodge a pine-pocked spine of the Sierra swept up to blue March sky.
Halfway up the slope behind the lodge two thick thumbs of snow
jutted out, between them a gap that dropped off into space. Two
weeks earlier the cornice had been punched away by the weight of a
snowboarder, burying and killing him probably in the same instant.
</P>
<P>
   As Bela Vadasz, ASI's founder and an alpinist of twenty-plus
years would tell me later, such accidents could often be avoided.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like most winter accidents usually occur for some
basic reason,'' Vadasz said. ``It's not like a whole bunch of
little things went wrong. Often it's just some basic precautions
that were ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in the hut, Biega began his instruction by having everyone
empty his backpack and spread its contents out on the floor.
Biega's consisted of six tiny stuff sacks, each organized so that
he could put his hands on things quickly. An emergency sack
contained a space blanket, duct tape, energy bars, parachute cord
and a candle and waterproof matches. There was an alarm clock for
quick catnaps.
</P>
<P>
   Biega sorted quickly through our piles, thinning our loads
substantially. Then he turned an eye on our nattily layered selves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the biggest mistake people make is not dressing
adequately,'' he said. ``So if anyone has anything that's cotton,
you should leave it behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has worked up a sweat knows that few things absorb,
and hold, moisture better than cotton. And you don't need to be a
MIT graduate to know that wet plus cold equals miserable.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the hut, we crossed the road, scaled an eight-foot
snowbank, put on snowshoes and shouldered our packs. Biega gave a
brief directional overview, pointing to the north, south, east and
west. We would be heading northeast, said Biega. So if we got lost,
which way would we go?
</P>
<P>
   ``Right. Southwest until you hit the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Off we strode single file, the snow firm and squeaky clean
beneath our feet. Our goal for the afternoon was to find a place to
set up camp. A good winter campsite must be low and out of the
wind, but not too low because cold dense air settles.
</P>
<P>
   We hiked for about twenty minutes, until we came to a small glen
clumped with pines. On the exposed ridges just up the slope, the
wind had pinched our faces. Down here it was nearly still, the
boughs of the pines bobbing languidly. The pines showed no evidence
of branches ripped away or bent in the direction of a rushing
avalanche of snow.
</P>
<P>
   Finally Biega spoke. ``It all looks good to me.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time we started setting up camp it was mid-afternoon.
Blue sky had given way to gray clouds that scudded overhead under
full sail. As we used our snow shovels to flatten out a spot for
our tents, I noticed that the distant ranges had disappeared in a
foggy-white whorl. Looking up again a few minutes later, I watched
the whorl swallow a nearby slope, blurring the trees fuzzy gray. A
brief bout of hail pocked down on us.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless a general air of optimism prevailed. We had been out
in winter for half a day and we were all surprisingly comfortable.
And now, to ensure further comfort, we were creating our shelter
for the night, flattening out the ground, staking down our tents,
using our snow shovels to hack out square cubes of snow, then
setting them neatly on top of each other to build a wall to block
the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Biega was sculpting a winter home. Beneath the roof
formed by his cone-shaped tent, he'd dug out a standing-room deep
trench-cum-living room, complete with two snow benches and hollowed
out shelves where he could stash supplies.
</P>
<P>
   When you stepped down inside it was cozy and quiet, and
whitewashed walls of snow crystal blinked back at you. That night
as the wind roared far overhead, the six of us enjoyed freeze dried
Wild Time Turkey washed down with hot cocoa, our silences filled by
the propane hiss of Biega's stove.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't warm. I was still wearing three layers of clothing,
and tendrils of steam smoked up through my gloves like vapors off a
bog. But we were dry and comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   For me the biggest surprise came later that night, when I awoke
with a jolt and realized I would have to face what I had feared.
Hydration, Biega had repeatedly told us, is essential to staying
warm. I'd heeded his advice, and now I had to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Managing to unzip the damn tent flap, I stumbled out into a
strange and lovely world. Rather than the black of night, the world
was gray, illuminated by a landscape as smooth and taut as fresh
sheets. The snow fell steadily, and made no sound. I felt wrapped
in a serenity I'd never felt before.
</P>
<P>
   I stood in the snow enthralled, until my bare feet started to
burn.
</P>
<P>
   The next day I paid close attention as Biega showed us why any
smart back-country traveler carries at least a snow shovel and
space blanket, and how to use these items to make a cozy, and
potentially lifesaving snow cave. Find firm snowpack, put a slight
arch in the roof -- a flat roof could collapse -- and if you're in
trouble make the cave no bigger than a snug coffin; senseless to
waste energy, and the close confines, plus the space blanket wrap,
will help keep you warmer.
</P>
<P>
   And when we returned to the lodge late that afternoon, I
listened intently as Bela waxed on about the joys of winter; the
challenge, beauty and emptiness.
</P>
<P>
   When he finished, he smiled pleasantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``These experiences, they leave you with a piece of magic,'' he
said. ``Why not live as much magic in this lifetime, find as much
of it as you can?''
</P>
<P>
   Wonderful treat that we have wintertime to search it out.

WHAT NOT TO BUY FOR BABY
</HEADLINE>
  By JEFFREY GOLDBERG 
 c.1999 Slate 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A sort of shopping psychosis overtakes the mind of a father
fresh from the delivery room. It might be rooted in some sort of
primal hunter-gatherer-type urge, the kind that afflicts most men
when they enter a Price Club (``Of course we need 24 gallons of
WD-40, honey. You never know when they're going to stop making
it'').
</P>
<P>
   Conquer this urge, and you may graduate the first month of
parenthood without fielding a call from an American Express
security officer worried about ``unusual activity'' on your card.
</P>
<P>
   Here, then, a quick guide to what you need and what you don't.
This is, obviously, a subjective guide written by the kind of
flawed individual who actually considered buying an electric baby
wipe warmer.
</P>
<P>
   Diapers: Diaper bags are a good place to start, since they are
unnecessary: A $20 knapsack and a $2 dry-down--an absorbent,
washable pad--are perfectly sufficient substitutes.
</P>
<P>
   Diapers are, however, necessary, and I would suggest as a first
step the purchase of Price Club diapers, which come in huge cartons
and cost about 25 percent less than the equivalent number of
Pampers.
</P>
<P>
   Warehouse club diapers aren't as handsome or sturdy-looking as
``premium'' or ``supreme'' diapers, but even standard diapers today
can absorb the contents of a camel's hump without leaking. Avoid
``premium'' diapers that contain emollients or aloe vera, which
don't transfer to the baby's skin. The only diaper worth paying a
premium price for is one that changes itself.
</P>
<P>
   An indispensable purchase is a Diaper Genie, a brilliant little
contraption that is a vast improvement over the open diaper pail. A
Diaper Genie (which generally sells for around $25) accepts dirty
diapers through a hole on top, and with a few twists of a canister,
seals the diapers in plastic and eliminates most of the smell. It
does not provide Level 4 biohazard containment--ignore the
optimistic ``odor-free'' claim made on the box--but it will do in
most cases.
</P>
<P>
   Car safety: On issues of child safety, I take the SDI position,
which is to say, there is no such thing as too much defense
spending. A maximalist position on safety means only one car seat
will do, the Britax. It is more expensive than the run-of-the-mill
Century line of car seats (a Britax runs above $200), but it is
made of material so hard it would crack your knee if you walked
into it, and its belting system is far more encompassing and
elaborate than the average car seat's.
</P>
<P>
   Home safety: Every baby superstore features a section that could
be called the Wall of Death. At Buy Buy Baby, the suburban
Washington store with which I'm most familiar, the Wall of Death
rises 16 feet into the air and stretches 10 feet wide, and every
inch of the wall is covered with child safety products, some of
which are absolutely useless and most of which I have bought. (I
haven't got around to installing the toilet lid locks yet.)
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, outlet guards and rubber padding for low furniture
(the ``Coffee Tables of Death,'' with which most parents are
familiar) are necessary, but the Wall of Death preys on parental
fear. Hence, a product called ``fireplace gas valve safety
covers,'' whose purpose was too obscure for me to understand, and
the VCR Lock, which, according to the packaging, ``prevents child
from inserting objects into cassette opening.'' Another way to
prevent a deadly epidemic of object insertions is to move the VCR.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, the best way to keep a child from drowning in the
toilet is to keep an eye on the child or the toilet--excessive
reliance on safety products tends toward lower vigilance.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the baby monitors, arguably a necessity if you
live in a big house and can't hear the baby crying in her room--and
also a necessity if you're interested in intercepting police
transmissions--but is the Child View Monitor and Television, for
$149.99, really necessary? You can't even use it to spy on a nanny,
since it has no hidden camera capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Breast pumps: Ask someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Cribs: You can spend $500 (or $1,000) on a crib, or you can
spend $200. Spend $200. All cribs do the same thing, which is stand
there. All cribs sold in reputable stores meet current safety
standards, so no worries in that regard.
</P>
<P>
   Shoes: Payless ShoeSource, or the equivalent, is the way to go.
Actually, barefoot is the way to go, but in those places where a
small child should wear shoes--such as needle-strewn
playgrounds--it is a waste of money to spend more than $10.99 on a
pair of shoes. We bought Daughter No. 1 three pairs of $35 shoes,
which she outgrew in a month and wore so rarely in that month that,
amortized, the shoes cost $10 per wearing, money that could have
been better spent on fireplace gas valve safety covers.
</P>
<P>
   Toys: An endless subject, one that I'm hesitant to tackle, and
my children aren't old enough for me to comment on Furby with any
authority. One general observation, though: The wrapping paper is
always more interesting to a baby than whatever's inside, so my
gift suggestion would be a cardboard box wrapped in bright red
paper and filled with Tupperware and wooden spoons. That is, if you
can stand the noise produced by wooden spoons hitting Tupperware.

REDEFINING QUALITY TIME
</HEADLINE>
  By FRANCES LA BARRE 
 c.1998 Child magazine 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's Sunday night, and you're looking at a packed calendar,
wondering when and how you'll spend more time with your kids in the
upcoming week.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of ``quality time'' is meant to be reassuring to busy
parents. It suggests that even if your time with your children is
limited, when you use it wisely you can make up for a lack of
``quantity time.''
</P>
<P>
   But you have never been certain what is quality time, really?
Look at the following four scenarios. Can you figure out which ones
represent quality time?
</P>
<P>
   1. You and your spouse take Megan, 4, and Robby, 6, to the zoo.
You have a fine day, topped off with ice-cream cones. On the way
home, you tell the kids that later on Mom and Dad have to tackle
chores that were put aside to make time for the family outing. Soon
you hear fighting break out in the backseat.
</P>
<P>
   2. You've planned a treat for yourself and your 2-year-old,
Annie. She loves to go to the indoor play space nearby, so you've
rearranged your schedule to take her there. When it's time to go,
you expect to see an eager little face but find instead a balky
child who refuses to go. You can barely contain your dismay.
</P>
<P>
   3. You are watching James, 5, and Tanya, 7, play Chinese
checkers. Both kids are excited that each has jumped over four
marbles in a row. Tanya doesn't even mind when James wins. You have
to get dinner started, but they don't complain. They agree to play
another round in the kitchen while you cook and keep them company.
</P>
<P>
   4. It's a typical weekday morning. Dressing and breakfast are on
a tight schedule so that you can spend a little time over cereal
with Samantha, 3, before taking her to preschool. Samantha's been
trying to master new skills. As she pours her juice, she spills it
all over the floor, splashing some on her tights. Despite knowing
better, you become unglued and yell at her. Samantha begins to
wail.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a closer look at each situation; prepare to be surprised.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Kids Need Help to Shift Gears &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A trip to the zoo is, of course, classic quality time, an outing
the whole family can enjoy. But you might think that the trip was
spoiled by the kids' fussing at the end of the day. In fact quality
time includes dealing with difficult transitions and endings. With
your help, your children can learn how to hold onto the good
feelings despite the hard parts.
</P>
<P>
   If you plan to tackle jobs around the house later, let your
children know at the start of the trip so they won't be so startled
by the prospect of separation. The younger they are, the more they
need you to help them see the outing and the ending as a whole, to
help them think through what they will do next. Ease the transition
by encouraging them to draw pictures of the zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Notice whether great outings are too often the focus of your
time together. Perhaps you tend to think that your presence is not
enough and that you must fill the time spent with your children
with something special. Don't forget that they might love simply to
pounce on you for a Saturday-morning wrestling session.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Accept Your Toddlers' Emotions &LR;
</P>
<P>
   You had thought a special trip to the indoor play space would be
fun. Instead, you feel discouraged and wonder, ``Why bother?'' But
your plan is a good one--children do need their parents to share
their favorite activities. It's just that a 2-year-old is so young
she has barely begun to learn about planning and following through.
</P>
<P>
   Your flexibility about this is one of the most important
elements of quality time with a toddler. So relax; let go of your
ideas of quality time and work it out with her. Quality time isn't
just a fun, upbeat time. It's an opportunity to build a
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be fooled by your child's apparent rejection of you or the
outing. Sit close to her and help her find words for her feelings
without trying to control her emotions. She could be at odds with
herself _ completely normal for a 2-year-old-and want a cozier time
with you as well as the exciting outing.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Acknowledge Their Needs_ Out Loud &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If you recognized only the Chinese checkers game scenario as
quality time, you're laboring under the unnecessary burden of
thinking that quality time is something that occurs only when
everyone is happy.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you've forgotten a recent evening when both kids flew at
you as you entered the house after a stressful day at work. Your
oldest was complaining that her brother had wrecked her block
tower, and your son was howling because his sister refused to play
with him.
</P>
<P>
   To create quality time in this situation is undeniably
challenging, but it' helpful to remember that a little can go a
long way. Taking care not to add your burdens to your children's,
you might say, ``You know, right before dinner is a hard time for
everybody _ we're all hungry and tired. I bet that's part of why
you two are having trouble. Help me hang up my coat and come with
me while I make a note about a phone call I forgot to return; then
we'll see to these problems together.''
</P>
<P>
   The value of this time together lies not only in the resolution
of the problems but also in your being able to work on them
together. Even after a pressure-filled day, try to remember the
importance of connection.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Keep Your Cool &LR;
</P>
<P>
   You may think the situation with Samantha is an out-and-out
disaster, but little household accidents can be valuable
experiences. First, reassure your preschooler that this kind of
thing happens to everyone. Next, why not apologize for losing it?
Tell her it's like spilling juice: We don't mean to, but it
happens.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's a plus if you can keep your cool. Take a moment
to ease your child's frustration. You might call in the ``911
emergency paper-towel squad,'' and zoom from there to toothbrushing
and changing her tights. This gives your child a way to help right
things and supports her growing sense of mastery.
</P>
<P>
   Quality time is time you spend with your children having fun.
But it's also time you spend dealing with beginnings and endings,
downtime, squabbles and battles, disappointments, upsets, and the
stew of emotions _ yours and theirs _ that these circumstances stir
up.
</P>
<P>
   Quality time is any time you achieve an intimate connection with
your children.

<TEXT>
<P>
   I can't believe it. I lost my job.
</P>
<P>
   Well, they called it a demotion, but really I got the old boot.
After all these years of loyal dedicated service, I was dismissed
without so much as a day's notice or a Timex watch. You know, you
give your all to these people, day after day, year after year of
faithful, efficient, prompt, all-American work ethic and what do
you get for your trouble? More trouble, that's what.
</P>
<P>
   Now I'm not talking about my regular 9-to-5. No, this was one of
my little side gigs that I've had for over a decade. The pay wasn't
very good, but I enjoyed it and, actually, I was very good at it. I
hardly ever got any complaints. It wasn't a highly skilled
position. I suppose almost anyone could do it. But I still think my
seniority should have been given some consideration.
</P>
<P>
   But no, they went and replaced me with this young kid who hasn't
even graduated from school yet. Can you believe that? If you even
find a hair on his chin, I assure you that it just fell out of one
of his bushy eyebrows. Yeah, I'll admit it. He's a little faster.
Other than that, he's got nothing on me.
</P>
<P>
   I'm so upset that I don't know what to do with myself. It was my
job, darn it! I've always answered the telephone around my house!
Now, my son is the official phone man.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes I think the boy has dog ears or something. He grabs
that receiver before the ``ing'' leaves the ring. I keep telling
him that it has to ring twice before the caller ID is activated.
Not that we screen our calls or anything. Well, OK, yeah, we screen
our calls sometimes. You've just got to be in the right mood to
talk to some people you know. Anyway, he's so quick on the draw
that you'd think Shaquille O'Neal or one of those Victoria's Secret
women was going to call here at any minute.
</P>
<P>
   But if the call's not for him, heaven help the person on the
other end. He lays the receiver on the counter and yells, ``Mom!''
or ``Dad!'' and then he goes back to playing video games. If we
heard him, fine. If not, oh well.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, I walk past the receiver and it's lying on the floor
making that awful ``dun, dun'' sound like a big truck backing up.
</P>
<P>
   I stand in front of him until he notices me and say, ``Did
someone call? Who was on the phone?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah,'' he says. ``Some lady wanted to talk to you. Didn't
you hear me call you? That was a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I didn't hear you. What was the lady's name?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sue? I think. Maybe it was Sharon. Something with an `S' in
it.''
</P>
<P>
   I run to the caller ID. Nothing. And I'm not a star-69 kind of
person. There's something about calling someone's home and saying,
``Did you call me?'' that intimidates me. I did it once and the
person said, ``No, who are you?'' So I hung up and the stranger
called me back and said, ``Did you just call me?'' It was awful. We
went back and forth like that several times until I finally
recognized the voice and said, ``Mama, is that you?''
</P>
<P>
   And it gets worse. On the rare occasion that he writes a message
down, my son forgets to give it to me. Usually, I find a scrap of
paper on the floor two days later that says, ``Sue or Sharon
called. It's real important.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Sue and/or Sharon, forget leaving messages with the kid.
</P>
<P>
   Until I can figure out a way to get my position back, if it's
important, just call me at work.

SPECIALISTS DIVIDED OVER VALUE OF BLOOD TEST FOR WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Time Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Martha Borgeson was planning a trip to Italy when
she saw her gynecologist for a routine exam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was all excited about the trip and I felt great,'' she said.
``My doctor gave me the exam and then a change came over his face.
He said, `You're not going to Italy.'''
</P>
<P>
   Several tests later, Borgeson received the news: She had ovarian
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't two tumors, it was three. I was in a state of shock,
obviously,'' said Borgeson, of North Greenbush, N.Y. That was
almost 10 years ago. Since then, Borgeson, 64, has had two major
surgeries at the Albany Medical Center Hospital, including a
complete hysterectomy, and regular infusions of chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   And every three months, she has a controversial blood test,
known as CA-125, to monitor her cancer. Dawn, Borgeson's healthy
38-year-old daughter, also gets the test twice a year, but as a
screening tool to pick up on any early signs of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Healthy women, even those without a family history of the
disease, are increasingly turning to the CA-125 test as a
diagnostic tool against a cancer that has for years been dubbed
``the silent killer.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 14,500 American women will die from ovarian cancer
this year and more than 25,000 new cases will be diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   Some specialists are advocating the test become as routine as
the pap smear, an annual exam to detect cervical cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Yet health specialists are cautious about the blood test, which
determines levels of a tumor marker known as CA-125. In the past,
the test has mostly been used as a way to monitor the recurrence of
disease by detecting high levels of CA-125 in the blood.
</P>
<P>
   Though effective as a monitoring tool, physicians say the CA-125
tests falls short of being a good diagnostic test.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may have an elevated test and you may not have ovarian
cancer at all,'' said Dr. Cora Bonatsos, a medical oncologist at
the Albany Regional Cancer Center.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors fear that the inappropriate use of the test may
lead to unnecessary medical treatments and a lot of anxiety for
many women. ``The trouble with it is, you'll get a lot of false
positives,'' said Dr. Bruce Clark, an obstetrician and gynecologist
in nearby Latham.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians attribute the surge of interest in such an
unpredictable test to women's frustration with the disease. More
than half the women diagnosed with ovarian cancer die from it
within five years.
</P>
<P>
   Such grim statistics are blamed on the fact ovarian cancer is
notoriously difficult to diagnose in its earliest, most curable,
stages. By the time many doctors are able to detect the tumors
during a physical exam, many women have developed full-blown
disease.
</P>
<P>
   The standard treatment is surgery, followed by chemotherapy.
While there is no cure, ``we're keeping people alive longer,
feeling better,'' said Dr. John Malfetano, a professor of
obstetrics and gynecology at the Albany Medical College.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Kwong, who lives near Albany, had noticed only a little
spotting after a step aerobics class. Since it was unusual for her,
she called her doctor.
</P>
<P>
   At 34, five months after her wedding and after a series of
tests, Kwong was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and had a complete
hysterectomy. Now, four years later, she's challenged by weekly
chemotherapy treatments and some nagging questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I visited the gynecologist nine months before I had my
hysterectomy,'' she said. ``If they had drawn my CA-125 then, would
we have known earlier?''
</P>
<P>
   Malfetano said he understands women's fear of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``The symptoms are vague,'' he said. Sometimes, women will
notice pelvic or abdominal discomfort. Or they will experience
persistent gastrointestinal symptoms, like gas and bloating. Often,
as in the case with Borgeson, there are no complaints at all.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Malfetano still believes that the best use of the CA-125
test is for women already diagnosed with ovarian cancer as a way to
monitor tumor activity. An elevated level of CA-125 suggests that
tumors are reforming. He sees a lesser role for it in screening
only those women with a strong family history of breast or ovarian
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody else should make sure they get their annual
gynecological exam, he said. ``That's the best thing they can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Borgeson, meanwhile, has come up with her own strategy to beat
the odds.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, she finally toured Italy. And this spring, she and
three friends are celebrating their 65th birthdays with a
Mediterranean cruise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a lot of fun and a lot of laughs,'' she said.

   &UR; GRAY DAWN: THE GLOBAL AGING CRISIS &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By PETER G. PETERSON &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   (1,500 words) The world's population is getting older. Over the
next few decades, rich countries will experience an unprecedented
growth in the number of their elderly and an unprecedented decline
in the number of their youth. Yet in the poor nations, population
is growing. This may do more to change our future than deadly
superviruses, extreme climate change or the spread of nuclear,

<P>
   (1,300 words) In the past year, a handful of Washington business
lobbyists have waged a blistering campaign to persuade the world
that Congress has been engaged in a spasm of sanctions
proliferation. This is false. We have three major foreign-policy
tools: diplomacy, sanctions and war. Take away sanctions and how
can the United States deal with terrorists, proliferators and
genocidal dictators? Sanctions may not be perfect and they are not
always the answer, but they are often the only weapon.

   (1,200 words) No plausible instinct would impel a man to leave

In fact, the male appetite for battle has always been far less
voracious than army commanders might like. In traditional
societies, warriors often had to be taunted, intoxicated or
ritually ``transformed'' into animal form before battle.

<P>
   (1,100 words) The threat of war in Europe now looms as likely as

<P>
   (1,200 words) Today Russia is closer to bloody conflict than it
ever has been since the terrible civil war of 1918-20. For 70
years, the Soviet Union operated a strong state apparatus, anchored
by the KGB and the Communist Party. Now its disintegration has

</P>
<P>
   In October, Congress rushed to embrace an Iraq Liberation Act,
authorizing a whopping $97 million in military aid to democratic
Iraqi resistance groups. President Clinton's staff was
unenthusiastic, but Clinton signed rather than pick a fight. The
basic idea behind it? That the United States should refuse to

Iraqi opposition in his place. (slugged:

</P>
<P>
   Some critics of current U.S. policy argue that the United States
should help the opposition umbrella group known as the Iraqi
National Congress (INC) seize and hold large enclaves inside Iraq,
from which it would proceed to undermine Saddam's rule. But this
plan is militarily ludicrous and would almost certainly end in a
massive bloodbath. (slugged: BC-IRAQ-REBELS-INCOMPETENT -TWO-NYTSF)

</P>
<P>
   One more option for toppling Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq is
known as ``the Afghan approach.'' It stipulates that the United
States could help the Iraqi opposition mount an insurgency on the
model of the Afghan mujahideen, the Nicaraguan Contras or the Viet
Cong. Iraq's neighbors, however, aren't terribly thrilled at this
prospect. (slugged: BC-IRAQ-GUERILLA-WAR-THREE-NYTSF &LR;  &QL;

   (1,200 words) No plausible instinct would impel a man to leave
his home, cut his hair short and drill for hours under the hot sun.
In fact, the male appetite for battle has always been far less
voracious than army commanders might like. In traditional
societies, warriors often had to be taunted, intoxicated or
ritually ``transformed'' into animal form before battle.

   In October, Congress rushed to embrace an Iraq Liberation Act,
authorizing a whopping $97 million in military aid to democratic
Iraqi resistance groups. President Clinton's staff was
unenthusiastic, but Clinton signed rather than pick a fight. The
basic idea behind it? That the United States should refuse to

   &UR; GRAY DAWN: THE GLOBAL AGING CRISIS &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By PETER G. PETERSON &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   (1,500 words) The world's population is getting older. Over the
next few decades, rich countries will experience an unprecedented
growth in the number of their elderly and an unprecedented decline
in the number of their youth. Yet in the poor nations, population
is growing. This may do more to change our future than deadly
superviruses, extreme climate change or the spread of nuclear,
biological and chemical weapons.

   (1,300 words) In the past year, a handful of Washington business
lobbyists have waged a blistering campaign to persuade the world
that Congress has been engaged in a spasm of sanctions
proliferation. This is false. We have three major foreign-policy
tools: diplomacy, sanctions and war. Take away sanctions and how
can the United States deal with terrorists, proliferators and
genocidal dictators? Sanctions may not be perfect and they are not
always the answer, but they are often the only weapon.

 By DEBORAH SOLOMON  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    It's almost comical. Here we are at the end of our daring
century _ the century that took the figure out of art, the plot out
of fiction and the tune out of music _ and do you know who the
hottest artist is?
 &HT;    Norman Rockwell.
 &HT;    The same Norman Rockwell whose name was once synonymous with bad
taste.
 &HT;    When I studied art history in college, Rockwell's illustrations
of Santas and freckled Boy Scouts, of dogs and grandmothers, were
dismissed as fluff for calendars. Professors spoke of him, if at
all, with sneering disdain.
 &HT;    Now they adore him. I was recently talking to Robert Rosenblum,
the esteemed professor of fine arts at New York University, and he
mentioned the big Rockwell exhibition opening this fall at the High
Museum of Art in Atlanta. ``When I heard about the show,''
Rosenblum said, ``I got immediately sort of jealous and thought,
Why didn't they ask me to write something for the catalogue? But
I'm right in there cheering.''
 &HT;    Rosenblum, it should be noted, isn't just your average finicky
connoisseur. He has always had impressively terrible taste. In 1989
he published a controversial book, ``Paintings in the Musie
d'Orsay,'' which retold the story of art in a new and naughty way,
mingling the masterworks of Cezanne, Manet and the usual
avant-garde masters with the work of artists such as William
Adolphe Bouguereau, a leader of the official salon who was known
for his schmaltzy female nudes.
 &HT;    I asked Rosenblum why he is drawn to bad art, and he recalled
that Francois Cachin, the former director of the Musie d'Orsay, was
once asked the same question. She replied in protest, ``Oh, but I
only like the best bad art!''
 &HT;    Bad art _ nowadays, the best and the worst of it is getting
excellent exposure. The Museum of Bad Art, which opened in 1996 in
Dedham, Mass., a suburb of Boston, is devoted to the work of Sunday
painters who specialize in stuff like Day-Glo sunsets, perky daisy
scenes and pictures of wide-eyed, fuzzy puppies.
 &HT;    The idea may be amusing, but it's also an exercise in
redundancy: Museums everywhere now show bad art _ not amateur
painting, but the best bad art, the technically skillful kind once
banished to museum basements mainly because it went against the
modernist ban on sentimentality.
 &HT;    An obvious example is the exhibition ``Victorian Fairy
Painting,'' a swarm of cutie-pies with silvery wings that recently
alighted at the Frick Collection in New York. Not long ago, fairy
painting was widely disparaged as so much slick kitsch, as was the
art of Gustave Moreau, a painter of gold-hued Symbolist fantasies
whose first-ever retrospective opens at the Art Institute of
Chicago next month.
 &HT;    Moreau, according to the tough modernist critic Clement
Greenberg, ``sank painting to an all-time low.'' He's among the
many 19th-century lightweights who have lately come into fashion,
and his revival springs from the same impulse that has turned
Rockwell, a famous square, into the height of hipness.
 &HT;    I like the vogue for bad art, which represents a welcome release
from the snobbery of the past. For much of this century, the art
that was hailed as quintessentially modern belonged to a single
category _ abstraction _ and though Picasso never went completely
abstract, his Cubism was viewed as the Big Bang that made all forms
of art life possible.
 &HT;    Abstract art was not easy to understand, and it led the American
public to think of museums as intimidating places ruled by a cadre
of experts whose taste and rituals seemed as mysterious as those of
Byzantine priests.
 &HT;    The vogue for bad art seeks to prove that visual rewards are not
confined to the A-list masterpieces hanging at the Museum of Modern
Art. It's a truism that taste changes, but the rampant revisionism
of the '90s isn't just a backlash against modernist taste or one
more rotation in the cycle of coolness. Rather, it marks the end of
coolness _ a premillennial yearning for the safe past, for the kind
of reassuring experience that avant-garde art aggressively
renounced.
 &HT;    You don't need to contemplate angst or alienation standing in
front of an N.C. Wyeth (the subject of an ambitious new biography),
Disney animation cels (which are bringing insane prices at auction)
or Grandma Moses, one of the countless self-taught primitives whose
resumes are now as long as those of Yale MFAs.
 &HT;    To be sure, conservative critics would agree with none of this.
They wring their hands, decry the decline of standards and
basically argue that the vogue for Rockwell and his nonelitist ilk
represents what might be called a case of Madonna envy, an attempt
among art historians to seize some of the glamour of pop culture
for their own field.
 &HT;    Recently, I tried out this theory on Karal Ann Marling, a
professor of art history and American studies at the University of
Minnesota. ``It's all too true,'' she wryly remarked. ``The push-up
brassiere is everywhere in academia.''
 &HT;    Marling, whose books include ``Graceland: Going Home With
Elvis'' (Harvard University Press, 1996) and ``Norman Rockwell''
(Harry N. Abrams, 1997), has no rivals as a champion of bad art.
 &HT;    ``It bothers me,'' she says, ``that people such as Rosenblum go
just as far as Victorian fairy painting and that's as much bad
taste as they are willing to let into their lives. What I try to
teach my students is to look not only at Leonardo, but to look at
Coke cans or the work of paint-by-number amateurs in the same
way.''
 &HT;    A plump, easily amused redhead with a chipped front tooth and
rings on every finger, Marling looks less like a professor than
someone who faithfully reads the recipes in McCall's. She's on
sabbatical this term, writing every day from 6 in the morning until
4, when ``Oprah,'' her favorite show, comes on.
 &HT;    ``I try to spend one day a week in stores,'' she says of her
life in Minneapolis, ``and that's where I hone my visual skills. I
get the same satisfaction from the Walker Art Center that I get
from the Mall of America'' _ in her opinion, one of the wonders of
the nonancient world.
 &HT;    It is easy enough to find fault with Marling's anything-goes,
shop-'til-you-drop school of esthetics. To discern equal worth in
art and pop culture is to strip art of its seriousness (and to
strip pop culture of its fun). No thinking person could hope for
such chaos. Marling might be described as a belated Pop artist, a
campus Andy Warhol. She's doing to art history what Warhol did to
painting in the early '60s, erasing the line between Elvis culture
and elite culture.
 &HT;    And yet, for all her unsettling perverseness, Marling is
providing a needed jolt to her field. In an age when
post-structuralists are burying art beneath dust balls of theory,
and when it's nearly impossible to read an article without
stumbling across a reference to the ``the reified moment of
perception,'' there is something appealing about critics who insist
simply that we look _ at everything from Hellenistic marbles to
Hallmark cards.
 &HT;    In the galleries too, looking is becoming obsolete, perhaps
because the work of hot artists seldom gives off real creative
heat. Too often, the art world seems less like a world than a tiny
club with all of 23 brand-name artists in it. Where can we go to
find the edge, to recover our lost wildness, to escape the thronged
blockbusters and the buzz of Acoustiguides?
 &HT;    By now, avant-garde art is so accepted that even Duchamp's
urinal looks classical, which helps explain why nothing seems more
outrageous than middlebrow art and the sort of pictures your
grandmother savored _ the art, in short, of 100 percent normal
Norman Rockwell.

 By DEBORAH SOLOMON  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    It's almost comical. Here we are at the end of our daring
century _ the century that took the figure out of art, the plot out
of fiction and the tune out of music _ and do you know who the
hottest artist is?
 &HT;    Norman Rockwell.
 &HT;    The same Norman Rockwell whose name was once synonymous with bad
taste.
 &HT;    When I studied art history in college, Rockwell's illustrations
of Santas and freckled Boy Scouts, of dogs and grandmothers, were
dismissed as fluff for calendars. Professors spoke of him, if at
all, with sneering disdain.
 &HT;    Now they adore him. I was recently talking to Robert Rosenblum,
the esteemed professor of fine arts at New York University, and he
mentioned the big Rockwell exhibition opening this fall at the High
Museum of Art in Atlanta. ``When I heard about the show,''
Rosenblum said, ``I got immediately sort of jealous and thought,
Why didn't they ask me to write something for the catalogue? But
I'm right in there cheering.''
 &HT;    Rosenblum, it should be noted, isn't just your average finicky
connoisseur. He has always had impressively terrible taste. In 1989
he published a controversial book, ``Paintings in the Musie
d'Orsay,'' which retold the story of art in a new and naughty way,
mingling the masterworks of Cezanne, Manet and the usual
avant-garde masters with the work of artists such as William
Adolphe Bouguereau, a leader of the official salon who was known
for his schmaltzy female nudes.
 &HT;    I asked Rosenblum why he is drawn to bad art, and he recalled
that Francois Cachin, the former director of the Musie d'Orsay, was
once asked the same question. She replied in protest, ``Oh, but I
only like the best bad art!''
 &HT;    Bad art _ nowadays, the best and the worst of it is getting
excellent exposure. The Museum of Bad Art, which opened in 1996 in
Dedham, Mass., a suburb of Boston, is devoted to the work of Sunday
painters who specialize in stuff like Day-Glo sunsets, perky daisy
scenes and pictures of wide-eyed, fuzzy puppies.
 &HT;    The idea may be amusing, but it's also an exercise in
redundancy: Museums everywhere now show bad art _ not amateur
painting, but the best bad art, the technically skillful kind once
banished to museum basements mainly because it went against the
modernist ban on sentimentality.
 &HT;    An obvious example is the exhibition ``Victorian Fairy
Painting,'' a swarm of cutie-pies with silvery wings that recently
alighted at the Frick Collection in New York. Not long ago, fairy
painting was widely disparaged as so much slick kitsch, as was the
art of Gustave Moreau, a painter of gold-hued Symbolist fantasies
whose first-ever retrospective opens at the Art Institute of
Chicago next month.
 &HT;    Moreau, according to the tough modernist critic Clement
Greenberg, ``sank painting to an all-time low.'' He's among the
many 19th-century lightweights who have lately come into fashion,
and his revival springs from the same impulse that has turned
Rockwell, a famous square, into the height of hipness.
 &HT;    I like the vogue for bad art, which represents a welcome release
from the snobbery of the past. For much of this century, the art
that was hailed as quintessentially modern belonged to a single
category _ abstraction _ and though Picasso never went completely
abstract, his Cubism was viewed as the Big Bang that made all forms
of art life possible.
 &HT;    Abstract art was not easy to understand, and it led the American
public to think of museums as intimidating places ruled by a cadre
of experts whose taste and rituals seemed as mysterious as those of
Byzantine priests.
 &HT;    The vogue for bad art seeks to prove that visual rewards are not
confined to the A-list masterpieces hanging at the Museum of Modern
Art. It's a truism that taste changes, but the rampant revisionism
of the '90s isn't just a backlash against modernist taste or one
more rotation in the cycle of coolness. Rather, it marks the end of
coolness _ a premillennial yearning for the safe past, for the kind
of reassuring experience that avant-garde art aggressively
renounced.
 &HT;    You don't need to contemplate angst or alienation standing in
front of an N.C. Wyeth (the subject of an ambitious new biography),
Disney animation cels (which are bringing insane prices at auction)
or Grandma Moses, one of the countless self-taught primitives whose
resumes are now as long as those of Yale MFAs.
 &HT;    To be sure, conservative critics would agree with none of this.
They wring their hands, decry the decline of standards and
basically argue that the vogue for Rockwell and his nonelitist ilk
represents what might be called a case of Madonna envy, an attempt
among art historians to seize some of the glamour of pop culture
for their own field.
 &HT;    Recently, I tried out this theory on Karal Ann Marling, a
professor of art history and American studies at the University of
Minnesota. ``It's all too true,'' she wryly remarked. ``The push-up
brassiere is everywhere in academia.''
 &HT;    Marling, whose books include ``Graceland: Going Home With
Elvis'' (Harvard University Press, 1996) and ``Norman Rockwell''
(Harry N. Abrams, 1997), has no rivals as a champion of bad art.
 &HT;    ``It bothers me,'' she says, ``that people such as Rosenblum go
just as far as Victorian fairy painting and that's as much bad
taste as they are willing to let into their lives. What I try to
teach my students is to look not only at Leonardo, but to look at
Coke cans or the work of paint-by-number amateurs in the same
way.''
 &HT;    A plump, easily amused redhead with a chipped front tooth and
rings on every finger, Marling looks less like a professor than
someone who faithfully reads the recipes in McCall's. She's on
sabbatical this term, writing every day from 6 in the morning until
4, when ``Oprah,'' her favorite show, comes on.
 &HT;    ``I try to spend one day a week in stores,'' she says of her
life in Minneapolis, ``and that's where I hone my visual skills. I
get the same satisfaction from the Walker Art Center that I get
from the Mall of America'' _ in her opinion, one of the wonders of
the nonancient world.
 &HT;    It is easy enough to find fault with Marling's anything-goes,
shop-'til-you-drop school of esthetics. To discern equal worth in
art and pop culture is to strip art of its seriousness (and to
strip pop culture of its fun). No thinking person could hope for
such chaos. Marling might be described as a belated Pop artist, a
campus Andy Warhol. She's doing to art history what Warhol did to
painting in the early '60s, erasing the line between Elvis culture
and elite culture.
 &HT;    And yet, for all her unsettling perverseness, Marling is
providing a needed jolt to her field. In an age when
post-structuralists are burying art beneath dust balls of theory,
and when it's nearly impossible to read an article without
stumbling across a reference to the ``the reified moment of
perception,'' there is something appealing about critics who insist
simply that we look _ at everything from Hellenistic marbles to
Hallmark cards.
 &HT;    In the galleries too, looking is becoming obsolete, perhaps
because the work of hot artists seldom gives off real creative
heat. Too often, the art world seems less like a world than a tiny
club with all of 23 brand-name artists in it. Where can we go to
find the edge, to recover our lost wildness, to escape the thronged
blockbusters and the buzz of Acoustiguides?
 &HT;    By now, avant-garde art is so accepted that even Duchamp's
urinal looks classical, which helps explain why nothing seems more
outrageous than middlebrow art and the sort of pictures your
grandmother savored _ the art, in short, of 100 percent normal
Norman Rockwell.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    The phone yanked Steve Drescher from a deep slumber early on a
mid-November Monday. He shook the weekend's cobwebs from his head
and mumbled hello. The CIA was calling.
 &HT;    ``Hi, remember me?'' said the voice on the line. ``I'm Mike. I'm
with the CIA. We're interested in you.''
 &HT;    Drescher came slowly into consciousness, wondering what the man
was talking about, and why the CIA was calling him _ a 19-year-old
sophomore at Ohio State University.
 &HT;    Then he dimly remembered dropping off a resume several weeks
earlier with an agency recruiter on Career Day, the bustling job
fair that Ohio State holds for its 48,500 students. Drescher, a
budding computer programmer, had been much more focused that day on
a job at Microsoft or Compuserve.
 &HT;    The next night, he sat under a fluorescent light in a campus
conference room, too nervous to touch his cooling pizza, listening
to Mike try to convince him and 25 other students that it would be
neat to be a spy.
 &HT;    ``I'm clueless as to what I would actually do for the CIA,''
Drescher said to me. ``The only thing I have to go on is the
movies. To me, it's 'Mission: Impossible.'''
 &HT;    The world's most famous intelligence service has kicked off the
biggest recruiting drive in its history, digging deeply into the
American landscape for a vein, a nugget, a trace of talent.
 &HT;    Never before has it been so easy to arrange an interview with
the agency: just call (800) 562-7242 (``JOBS CIA''), or log onto
www.cia.gov. Answer the want ads in The Economist, The New York
Times and The Wall Street Journal _ then come on in for a
lie-detector test!
 &HT;    A few years from now, you too could be digging up dirt in
Khartoum, skulking through the bazaars of Peshawar or poring over
documents purloined from Pyongyang.
 &HT;    George J. Tenet, the director of Central Intelligence, says he
has to mount ``a very aggressive way to bring people in'' _ two or
three thousand bright young Americans in the next few years _ or
risk the slow death of American intelligence.
 &HT;    ``To do what I expect to do, to have the depth that I expect
that we need to have, you have to go recruit the best and the
brightest,'' he says.
 &HT;    In fact, Tenet hopes to make the clandestine service bigger than
it was at the height of the Cold War, to open more overseas
stations and bases, to mount more complex and more expensive secret
operations. And he wants the nation's sharpest talents to come to
work at CIA headquarters as intelligence analysts, information
technicians and in-house experts on everything from Afghanistan to
Zimbabwe.
 &HT;    In sum, he aims to revitalize an agency that has been mired in a
slough of despond _ terrible publicity, terrible morale, terrible
credibility.
 &HT;    ``I will not allow the CIA to become a second-rate
organization,'' Tenet told a gathering of the agency's employees
recently.
 &HT;    By most accounts, including Tenet's, the hiring blitz is the
most important internal affair on the agency's agenda for the rest
of the century. Congress will pump hundreds of millions of extra
dollars into the agency over the next few years to get new blood
flowing.
 &HT;    But success is hardly assured. With the Cold War a fading memory
and the CIA increasingly scorned as a bungling bureaucracy, who
really wants to be a spy anymore?
 &HT;    At the Ohio State job fair, the agency set up a spiffy booth
sandwiched between Chase Manhattan and a computer company. The
recruiters handed out vaguely informative pamphlets and brochures.
Fear and ignorance about the CIA were rampant, judging from
interviews with students at the fair.
 &HT;    ``People don't have a very clear idea of what they do,'' said
Tim Paradis, 22, editor of the school paper, The Lantern. ``It's a
dark government agency.'' Richelle Sherwood, 24, an Air Force
veteran who speaks Vietnamese, said, ``I don't really know a lot
about them, except they do all this secret stuff.''
 &HT;    Karl Curtis, 21, an information-systems major, was intrigued but
uninformed. ``You've heard the rumors, you've seen the movies,
you're curious about what weird things they do,'' he said. ``I
guess you'd get to know the dirty things, the cool things about the
world. And a 'top secret' clearance is a really marketable skill.''
 &HT;    Marwan Saleh, 22, wearing a brush cut and a sharp suit, stood
out. A fiercely patriotic Palestinian-American, mellifluously
fluent in Arabic, he's also a frequent visitor to the homeland, the
holder of a political-science degree _ and slated to receive an MBA
this spring in global supply and demand.
 &HT;    The CIA would fall at his feet. But he's not likely to let them.
``I'm an American Democrat,'' he said. ``I believe as an American
that it's my duty to question and help develop American policy. And
the CIA seems like it would be executing policy. And I can't blind
myself. I have my own political views.'' He moved on.
 &HT;    What's more, at the fair, even the Steak 'n' Shake recruiters
were offering salaries that pay more than most CIA entry-level
jobs. Bringing top students into the agency was no small challenge.
 &HT;    Still, the CIA's marketing push has yielded many new applicants:
the Web site and want ads draw 50,000 resumes a year. But there's a
mismatch between the people who want in and the people the agency
wants to let in. Of those who formally apply, four out of five will
never make it past an initial interview.
 &HT;    ``We are not for everybody, and everybody is not for us,'' says
Gil Medeiros, head of the CIA's newly created Recruitment Center.
``There are a fair number of resumes we have to throw away.''
 &HT;    Perhaps the biggest obstacle in recruiting young Americans, he
says, is ``the lack of awareness of history'' among them. ``It is
amazing how little they know about us.'' And most of what they know
is wrong: a jumble of ``The X-Files,'' half-remembered headlines
and good old-fashioned American paranoia. And a lot of people think
the CIA is some sort of secret police force, running around the
United States killing people with high-tech guns.
 &HT;    Once upon a time in the Cold War, the agency would never have
advertised itself. It would have been unthinkable, unnecessary,
unseemly. But when the hammer and sickle came down over the
Kremlin, the veterans of the Cold War began cleaning out their
desks.
 &HT;    Over the past six years, the CIA has lost about 4,000 of its
most experienced and skilled people: about 20 percent of its spies,
analysts, scientists and technology experts. Ten years ago, the
agency was probably 10 years ahead of the public sector when it
came to computer capability. No longer.
 &HT;    The agency desperately needs, right now, hundreds of computer
wizards comfortable with the latest technology. But competing with
the likes of Microsoft and IBM is proving increasingly difficult.
 &HT;    The decline has been most significant at the CIA's directorate
of operations _ the clandestine service, the spies who serve
abroad. At least 7 percent of the spy cadre has left the agency in
each of the past six years. That adds up to about a thousand spies,
and it leaves not many more than a thousand in place. The
departures of hundreds of officers in their 30s and 40s were
especially troubling to the CIA.
 &HT;    This same instability has permeated the agency's top brass. No
director of Central Intelligence has served for more than two years
in this decade. The whirlwind has at times left the CIA
directionless, a ship in irons. And bad publicity _ traitors
within, snafus abroad _ further angered and depressed the agency.
 &HT;    ``There were tremendous internal morale problems,'' says John M.
Deutch, Director of Central Intelligence in 1995 and 1996.
``Tremendously poor morale and tremendously poor credibility.''
 &HT;    The agency used to recruit new people through an underground
network at the best universities and officers' clubs. The
talent-spotting system it had among student bodies was unique. It
existed on every major college campus in the country _ not just
Yale (where the crew coach recruited) and Princeton (where at least
one dean did the tapping), but at the University of Texas and Holy
Cross too.
 &HT;    And mandatory military service gave the agency the ability to
sign up thousands of officers who had spent time abroad in Europe
or Asia. When the draft ended 26 years ago, the CIA lost access to
a lot of people who had experience in the military, who had
actually lived overseas.
 &HT;    In those years, the agency had an aura of mystery and power
which it may never regain. Its officers were told time and time
again that they were an elite organization and it was a badge of
honor to be recruited and selected to work in CIA.
 &HT;    But most of the people milling around at the Ohio State job fair
were born after the collapse of Saigon in 1975. The Cold War ended
when they were still kids.
 &HT;    What's more, says Milt Bearden, a retired CIA veteran: ``Their
appreciation of American history is probably from Oliver Stone
movies, or a very cursory reading of history, as Americans haven't
been forced by world events to do much with history. And so how do
they recruit today?''
 &HT;    By December, the agency had received resumes from 123 Ohio State
students, interviewed 30 and conditionally offered jobs to 18. Five
or six of those students will wind up working for the agency after
passing the lie-detector tests and the other physical and
psychological screenings that are part of life at the CIA, the
recruiters say.
 &HT;    The CIA's talent-hunters hit 50 more campuses this fall. Their
campaign generated close to 100 job applications a day. In
addition, the agency is focusing attention on the children of
ethnic Americans _ combing America's cities and the suburbs,
looking for the children of immigrants and refugees, particularly
young men and women who grew up in first-generation Asian and Arab
households, and reaching out to these potential recruits through
ads in ethnic newspapers throughout the United States.
 &HT;    The languages these people speak, and their physical appearance,
could come in handy when the CIA tries to do some of its most
important work _ penetrating nations like Iraq or North Korea _
with home-grown American spies.

each of the past six years. That adds up to about a thousand spies,
and it leaves not many more than a thousand in place. The
departures of hundreds of officers in their 30s and 40s were
especially troubling to the CIA.
 &HT;    This same instability has permeated the agency's top brass. No
director of Central Intelligence has served for more than two years
in this decade. The whirlwind has at times left the CIA
directionless, a ship in irons. And bad publicity _ traitors
within, snafus abroad _ further angered and depressed the agency.
 &HT;    ``There were tremendous internal morale problems,'' says John M.
Deutch, Director of Central Intelligence in 1995 and 1996.
``Tremendously poor morale and tremendously poor credibility.''
 &HT;    The agency used to recruit new people through an underground
network at the best universities and officers' clubs. The
talent-spotting system it had among student bodies was unique. It
existed on every major college campus in the country _ not just
Yale (where the crew coach recruited) and Princeton (where at least
one dean did the tapping), but at the University of Texas and Holy
Cross too.
 &HT;    And mandatory military service gave the agency the ability to
sign up thousands of officers who had spent time abroad in Europe
or Asia. When the draft ended 26 years ago, the CIA lost access to
a lot of people who had experience in the military, who had
actually lived overseas.
 &HT;    In those years, the agency had an aura of mystery and power
which it may never regain. Its officers were told time and time
again that they were an elite organization and it was a badge of
honor to be recruited and selected to work in CIA.
 &HT;    But most of the people milling around at the Ohio State job fair
were born after the collapse of Saigon in 1975. The Cold War ended
when they were still kids.
 &HT;    What's more, says Milt Bearden, a retired CIA veteran: ``Their
appreciation of American history is probably from Oliver Stone
movies, or a very cursory reading of history, as Americans haven't
been forced by world events to do much with history. And so how do
they recruit today?''
 &HT;    By December, the agency had received resumes from 123 Ohio State
students, interviewed 30 and conditionally offered jobs to 18. Five
or six of those students will wind up working for the agency after
passing the lie-detector tests and the other physical and
psychological screenings that are part of life at the CIA, the
recruiters say.
 &HT;    The CIA's talent-hunters hit 50 more campuses this fall. Their
campaign generated close to 100 job applications a day. In
addition, the agency is focusing attention on the children of
ethnic Americans _ combing America's cities and the suburbs,
looking for the children of immigrants and refugees, particularly
young men and women who grew up in first-generation Asian and Arab
households, and reaching out to these potential recruits through
ads in ethnic newspapers throughout the United States.
 &HT;    The languages these people speak, and their physical appearance,
could come in handy when the CIA tries to do some of its most
important work _ penetrating nations like Iraq or North Korea _
with home-grown American spies.

 By ISABEL ALLENDE  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Many years ago I was asked whether I planned someday to write a
novel about Pinochet.
 &HT;    No, I said, because as a character he was insignificant.
 &HT;    I need to retract that statement: One can say anything about him
except that he is insignificant. The general has held Chile in his
grip for 25 years and is still the most influential figure in the
country. A decade after he stepped down from the presidency, the
old dictator still holds the democratic government hostage.
 &HT;    For now, however, the general too is being held. He is under
house arrest in a London mansion, awaiting a final decision on an
extradition request by a Spanish magistrate, Baltasar Garzon, who
has accused him of crimes against humanity _ genocide, torture and
terrorism _ committed against Spanish citizens in Chile.
 &HT;    The request ignited a debate in Britain and Chile and throughout
the West on the wisdom and fairness of bringing former rulers to
trial for human-rights violations. As far as Augusto Pinochet is
concerned, however, the intellectual questions are moot.
 &HT;    By pursuing the general, assembling a strong legal case and
issuing the extradition request, Garzon has already achieved the
salutary result of Pinochet's moral ruin. Henceforth, a man who had
the gall to pose as his nation's savior will take his place
alongside Caligula and Idi Amin. Even if Pinochet never faces a
tribunal, justice has been done.
 &HT;    Pinochet has long stood as a symbol of brutality for the simple
reason that he was and always will be linked to Salvador Allende,
an icon of social justice in the early 1970s. Allende was the first
Marxist politician in the world to win the presidency of a country
in a free election. In the middle of the Cold War, he proposed
``the Chilean road toward Socialism,'' respecting the Constitution
and all the rights of the citizens. His dream was to build the kind
of Social Democratic government that every country in Europe _
except Spain and Ireland _ has today.
 &HT;    Salvador Allende was my father's cousin; in a Latin family, that
made him my uncle. I knew him well and loved him with a mixture of
admiration and anxiety. Although he was a kind man with a good
sense of humor, I always felt it was impossible to live up to his
standards and expectations.
 &HT;    Trained as a physician, he was well acquainted with the needs of
the poor. He was a founder of the Socialist Party, and was
appointed secretary of health at a young age.
 &HT;    In 1970, after three failed attempts, Allende finally won the
presidency in a sharply divided election. He was a minority
president, having received only 36 percent of the vote. And even
then, his coalition, Unidad Popular, was made up of several parties
that rarely saw eye to eye on anything. It was a political weakness
that was to stalk his presidency.
 &HT;    But that wasn't his biggest problem. Immediately after the
election results were in, the CIA and the Chilean right began a
campaign of terror to prevent him from assuming his post. They
planned the kidnapping of Ren Schneider, the commander in chief of
the armed forces, in order to provoke a military coup. But the plot
backfired, Schneider was killed and Allende became president.
 &HT;    The government nationalized the banks, many industries and the
copper mines, which represented the country's principal source of
revenue and which were in the hands of North American capitalists.
At that point the opposition, backed by the CIA, undertook a series
of actions intended to destabilize the economy. To make matters
worse, the government was paralyzed by power struggles within the
Unidad Popular.
 &HT;    The ensuing economic crisis reached staggering proportions. The
inflation rate soared to 350 percent amid shortages of every kind,
from food to spare parts for essential machines. Laborers and
farmers responded by taking over factories and farms. Armed groups
sprang up on the right and the left.
 &HT;    Remarkably, in spite of this somber picture, the Unidad Popular
actually increased its percentage of the vote in the 1973
parliamentary elections. In view of this, the opposition decided
that economic, political and social destabilization was not enough
to finish Allende. More drastic measures were needed.
 &HT;    With the country in an uproar, Salvador Allende decided to hold
a plebiscite. He planned to announce it on Sept. 10, as he notified
Pinochet (by then the head of the armed forces), but the general
asked him to postpone it until the 12th. The president did not live
to see that day.
 &HT;    On Sept. 11, the military coup took place that would leave a
profound mark on Chile's soul. Salvador Allende took his life in
the burning presidential palace.
 &HT;    That morning I left my home early. The streets were practically
empty, making me think that the bus drivers were striking again.
Then I saw military vehicles, tanks and groups of heavily armed
soldiers.
 &HT;    As I didn't have a radio in the car, I went to the house of a
friend nearby to listen to the news. She was very distressed: her
husband, a teacher, had gone to the school where he taught, and she
had not heard from him. By then all the radio stations, except one,
had been silenced by the military.
 &HT;    I went downtown to pick up her husband, which is how I ended up
witnessing the bombing of La Moneda palace. I heard my uncle's last
words on my friend's portable radio. We held hands crying as he
calmly addressed the country with a historic speech that later
would be broadcast and published all over the world.
 &HT;    Having declared that he would never resign his office, he
refused to flee the country in a plane offered by the generals. It
was the right choice, and not only because his heroic death
confirmed his place in history. Had he accepted their offer to go
into exile, we now know, Pinochet would have murdered him during
the flight. ``Kill the bitch and you eliminate the litter,'' he
said.
 &HT;    Until just before the coup, Pinochet was an obscure army
general. He had been elevated to the rank of commander in chief of
the armed forces by Allende himself only three weeks before, after
Gen. Carlos Prats resigned under pressure from the opposition.
Prats recommended Pinochet to Allende, saying he was a loyal
soldier who could be trusted to uphold the Constitution. (Prats,
who ended up in exile in Argentina, was eventually murdered on
orders from Pinochet.)
 &HT;    Pinochet was the last to join the insurrection, after the
marines, the air force and the police. The military junta that he
would soon command abolished Congress, muzzled the press, suspended
constitutional guarantees and began the systematic elimination of
the left. The right toasted with Champagne while leftists ran for
their lives and the rest of the population was dumbfounded.
 &HT;    Pinochet persecuted labor and student leaders, politicians,
intellectuals, artists and journalists, as well as all those who
were a part of the government of the Unidad Popular. The worst
repression was carried out against the lower classes, long viewed
by the military as the prime breeding ground of Marxism. The people
were punished for having dared defy those who had always held
political and economic power.
 &HT;    Thousands of Chileans were arrested, others found asylum in
embassies or escaped across the border, while many simply
disappeared. Torture centers and concentration camps were set up
throughout the country. Hundreds of prisoners were thrown from
planes into the sea _ after their bellies were slit open to make
sure that they would sink _ or blown to bits or plowed under by
bulldozers.
 &HT;    Fear became a way of life. Voices of protest were raised in most
of the world, because the socialist experiment of Salvador Allende
had aroused great sympathy, but Washington supported the
dictatorship of Pinochet.
 &HT;    The general changed the Constitution to designate himself
president. His desire for legitimacy is one of the many paradoxes
of his character. In early photographs he is wearing dark glasses,
his arms folded across his chest and his jaw thrust forward in a
caricature of the Latin American dictator. Later he modified his
image, wearing impeccable suits and shedding the sinister dark
glasses.
 &HT;    Today, at 83, Pinochet looks like a sly old grandfather. He
declares himself ``the defender of Western Christian
civilization,'' is ultraconservative in his politics,
nationalistic, like most military men, and considers himself a
practicing Catholic _ which apparently to him does not seem a
contradiction.
 &HT;    His hero is Napoleon, to whom he likes to be compared. There is
even a Pinochet Foundation, dedicated to assuring his place in
history as the Chilean Napoleon who saved the country from
communism, a task that some ``pinochetistas'' claim was assigned to
him directly by God. If this is not magical realism, it is quite
close.
 &HT;    Pinochet is characterized by his cunning. He surrounded himself
with the most intelligent ideologues of the right. He transformed
the economy of Chile, moving from social democracy to the
capitalism of Milton Friedman, but with little of the freedom
promised by the Chicago School.
 &HT;    Entrepreneurs and investors were in paradise. They enjoyed the
benefits of the free market but did not have to deal with unions;
workers were plentiful, cheap and submissive. The state still
intervened in the economy, but always in favor of the capitalists.
Greed became the new religion. Almost everything was privatized,
even hospitals and public schools.
 &HT;    Taken together, this created an economic boom and the basis for
sustained progress, which is the main argument of those who defend
Pinochet. But they can't disregard the social costs. This savage
capitalist revolution came out of the hides of the poor, who were
supposed to be satisfied with the crumbs trickling down from the
wealthy.
 &HT;    For the poorest of the poor, the trickle-down never did occur.
Today, a third of Chile's 15 million inhabitants still live in
poverty.
 &HT;    Although they may detest the general, most Chileans maintain
that he should not be judged in a foreign court for crimes
committed in Chile. They see the intervention of Spain and Britain
as colonialist. How would Americans react if Spain demanded the
extradition of Henry Kissinger or a former CIA director to stand
trial for the same atrocities that Pinochet is accused of?
 &HT;    There is an obvious double standard when it comes to European
and North American relations with less powerful nations. On the
other hand, there is no question that Pinochet could never be
judged in Chile. Despite the law of amnesty, there are 14 suits
against him pending in Chilean courts, but there is little chance
that he will ever face justice.
 &HT;    In Chile there is great caution with regard to the general, who
still has the support of 25 percent of the population. Among that
group is at least 80 percent of the wealthy and all the military. A
climate of hysteria reigns among the ultraright. The press,
controlled by the right, asserts that Pinochet's detention
humiliates all Chileans. According to a recent poll, however, 70
percent of the people don't care about his fate.
 &HT;    The general is still powerful and feared. The military is
exerting pressure, but there is no real danger of a coup.
Certainly, they are offended by Pinochet's arrest, and they don't
want an investigation of the crimes of the past.
 &HT;    But I doubt that they would lift a single rifle in his defense.
The young generals are not comfortable being identified with the
dictatorship; in a world that aspires to global justice, maybe they
feel that it's time to clean up their image.
 &HT;    In Santiago in early December, the atmosphere was tense, but
when it became clear that Pinochet was not returning anytime soon,
there was a sense of relief and the cloud of fear began to lift.
People talked openly in the streets.
 &HT;    On television shows, Pinochet was not called ``senator for
life'' anymore, but ``the former dictator.'' Leftist politicians
and victims of human-rights abuses were on TV daily expressing
their opinions.
 &HT;    But don't get me wrong; fear still reigns in Chile; 17 years of
terror left a mark. My country is traumatized, like an abused child
that is always expecting the next blow.
 &HT;    I feel no hatred for Pinochet. Hatred is a very heavy burden,
one I shook off many years ago, when I started writing. Writing has
allowed me to exorcise most of my demons and transform my pain into
strength. I would like to see him face a trial, so that the truth
about his crimes is fully exposed.
 &HT;    But I don't want the general to rot in prison, as so many of his
victims did. He has already suffered an undeniable defeat that
nothing can turn into victory.
 &HT;    Even without a trial, in the eyes of the world he is an alleged
criminal, and moral censure can be worse than prison. I merely wish
that in the winter of his life the general would ask forgiveness of
all those whose lives he destroyed, the families of the dead and
disappeared, the exiled and tortured; that he would reveal where
the bodies of his victims can be found.

want an investigation of the crimes of the past.
 &HT;    But I doubt that they would lift a single rifle in his defense.
The young generals are not comfortable being identified with the
dictatorship; in a world that aspires to global justice, maybe they
feel that it's time to clean up their image.
 &HT;    In Santiago in early December, the atmosphere was tense, but
when it became clear that Pinochet was not returning anytime soon,
there was a sense of relief and the cloud of fear began to lift.
People talked openly in the streets.
 &HT;    On television shows, Pinochet was not called ``senator for
life'' anymore, but ``the former dictator.'' Leftist politicians
and victims of human-rights abuses were on TV daily expressing
their opinions.
 &HT;    But don't get me wrong; fear still reigns in Chile; 17 years of
terror left a mark. My country is traumatized, like an abused child
that is always expecting the next blow.
 &HT;    I feel no hatred for Pinochet. Hatred is a very heavy burden,
one I shook off many years ago, when I started writing. Writing has
allowed me to exorcise most of my demons and transform my pain into
strength. I would like to see him face a trial, so that the truth
about his crimes is fully exposed.
 &HT;    But I don't want the general to rot in prison, as so many of his
victims did. He has already suffered an undeniable defeat that
nothing can turn into victory.
 &HT;    Even without a trial, in the eyes of the world he is an alleged
criminal, and moral censure can be worse than prison. I merely wish
that in the winter of his life the general would ask forgiveness of
all those whose lives he destroyed, the families of the dead and
disappeared, the exiled and tortured; that he would reveal where
the bodies of his victims can be found.

BAD AIR DAY IN THE CLINTON CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Look at what the tornado blew in, and then tell
me there isn't some kind of conspiracy to get President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton was speaking Sunday to tornado survivors in Beebe,
Ark., Paula Jones was in the crowd snapping a big piece of gum.
</P>
<P>
   She told reporters that she didn't come to her native Arkansas
from her home in Long Beach, Calif., to see Clinton, but ``to see
what they're going to do about the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones must be running for president of the Red Cross, now that
Elizabeth Dole is running for president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It sure looked like a case of political stalking. Jones once
said she was so traumatized by a proposition supposedly made by
Clinton that she suffered from an antipathy toward sex. Yet she
managed to blithely chew gum and walk into her alleged tormentor's
photo-op.
</P>
<P>
   You had to wonder who put her up to it.
</P>
<P>
   Jones can hardly afford to jet-set around to presidential
appearances like an anti-Clinton Alec Baldwin. She received
$850,000 in a settlement of her suit against Clinton, but
squabbling lawyers have claimed more than that in legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Jones has a lot of frequent-flier miles. Or maybe some
right-wingers gave this persistent plaintiff frequent-filer miles.
</P>
<P>
   Then Hurricane Monica was brought back by unpopular demand by
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and the windbag House impeachment
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the same day the paths of Jones and Clinton
intersected with that of a tornado, every newspaper in America had
a photo of an unhappy Monica Lewinsky escorted to an interrogation
by the House prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting took place in a $5,000-a-night suite donated by a
Washington hotel _ called the ``Presidential Suite.'' At least
someone in Washington has a sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know how big the right-wing conspiracy against Clinton
is. It's hard to tell, because our randy word-splitter of a
president has been his own biggest co-conspirator against himself.
</P>
<P>
   But it sure looks like there's been an effort to drag out all
the president's women, or at least two of them.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Senate voted to close its doors so we can't hear
them debating the dismissal of charges against the president.
</P>
<P>
   Let me see if I have this right. The senators are closing the
doors so taxpayers won't see them performing their highest duty,
yet the same senators will consider opening their doors so we can
see Monica Lewinsky? Is the Senate working for taxpayers or the
National Enquirer?
</P>
<P>
   As Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., said afterward: ``The vote in
the Senate said to the people, `We're cutting you out.'''
</P>
<P>
   You can be sure the Republicans wouldn't vote to cut us out if
Lewinsky testified.

SOMEONE'S HANGING ONTO ALL THOSE 50-CENT PIECES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Is the government making 50-cent coins anymore? It has been
over two years since I have seen a half-dollar coin in circulation.
</P>
<P>
   _ R.E.S., Arlington, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: More than 30.7 million Kennedy half-dollars were produced in
1998, according to figures published by the U.S. Mint.
</P>
<P>
   This makes the 50-cent piece the least-circulated piece of U.S.
coinage _ 7.2 billion coins of other denominations were produced
during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   The scarcity of the coin is attributed to two things: the lack
of vending machines that accept 50-cent coins and the large number
of people who hang onto them after receiving the coins.
</P>
<P>
   Full coinage production figures are available on the U.S. Mint's
World Wide Web site at www.usmint.gov.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I buy Kismet, a dice game that is similar to
Yahtzee?
</P>
<P>
   _ D.S., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Kismet is one of several classic games that is being
re-released by Endless Games as part of a ``retro games'' line of
products.
</P>
<P>
   Others include Concentration, Family Feud, Jotto, Password and
The Tickle Bee. Two more will be introduced in 1999: Beat the Clock
and the Price is Right.
</P>
<P>
   Password, the subject of another reader's question, has national
distribution and is being sold by Toys R Us, K-Mart, Target and
other chain stores.
</P>
<P>
   A company representative said that Kismet may be harder to find.
If you can't locate a copy, call Endless Games at (201) 386-9465 or

availability information.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I write to Dan Quayle?
</P>
<P>
   _ J.P.D., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Send letters to Vice President Quayle in care of his
political action committee, Campaign America, at 6263 N. Scottsdale
Road, Suite 292, Scottsdale, AZ 85250.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle told reporters earlier this month that he will probably
enter the 2000 presidential race. The Arizona Republic reported
that in February, Quayle is likely to file with the Federal
Election Committee to create a presidential exploratory campaign
committee.
</P>

<P>
   A little-understood global hazard _ the graying of the developed
world's population _ may actually do more to reshape our collective
future than deadly superviruses, extreme climate change or the
proliferation of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next several decades, countries in the developed world
will experience an unprecedented growth in the number of their
elderly and an unprecedented decline in the number of their youth.
</P>
<P>
   The timing and magnitude of this demographic transformation have
already been determined. Next century's elderly have already been
born and can be counted _ and their cost to retirement benefit
systems can be projected.
</P>
<P>
   It is time to take an unflinching look at the shape of things to
come.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Floridization of the developed world.
</P>
<P>
   Been to Florida lately? You may not have realized it, but the
vast concentration of seniors there _ nearly 19 percent of the
population _ represents humanity's future.
</P>
<P>
   Today's Florida is a demographic benchmark that every developed
nation will soon pass. Italy will hit the mark as early as 2003,
followed by Japan in 2005 and Germany in 2006. France and Britain
will pass present-day Florida around 2016; the United States and
Canada in 2021 and 2023.
</P>
<P>
   _ Societies much older than any we have ever known.
</P>
<P>
   Global life expectancy has grown more in the last 50 years than
over the previous five thousand. Until the Industrial Revolution,
people age 65 and over never amounted to more than 2 percent or 3
percent of the population. In today's developed world, they amount
to 14 percent. By the year 2030, they will reach 25 percent and be
closing in on 30 percent in some countries.
</P>
<P>
   _ An unprecedented economic burden on working-age people.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the next century, working-age populations in most
developed countries will shrink. Today the ratio of working
taxpayers to nonworking pensioners in the developed world is around
3:1. By 2030, absent reform, this ratio will fall to 1.5:1. In some
countries, such as Germany and Italy, it will drop to 1:1 or even
lower.
</P>
<P>
   The longevity revolution represents a miraculous triumph of
modern medicine and extra years of life will surely be treasured by
the elderly and their families. But pension plans and other
retirement-benefit programs were not designed to provide these
billions of extra years of payouts.
</P>
<P>
   _ The aging of the aged: the number of ``old old'' will grow
much faster than the number of ``young old.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations projects that by 2050, the number of people
age 65 to 84 worldwide will grow from 400 million to 1.3 billion (a
threefold increase). The number of people age 85 and over will grow
from 26 million to 175 million (a sixfold increase). The number age
100 and over will jump from 135,000 to 2.2 million (a sixteenfold
increase).
</P>
<P>
   The ``old old'' consume far more health care than the ``young
old'' _ about two to three times as much. For nursing-home care,
the ratio is roughly 20:1. Yet little of this cost is figured in
the official projections of future public expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   Falling birthrates will intensify the global aging trend. As
life spans increase, fewer babies are being born. As recently as
the late 1960s, the worldwide total fertility rate (that is, the
average number of lifetime births per woman) stood at about 5.0,
well within the historical range.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a behavioral revolution, driven by growing affluence,
urbanization, feminism, rising female participation in the
workforce, new birth-control technologies and legalized abortion.
The result: an unprecedented and unexpected decline in the global
fertility rate to about 2.7 _ a drop fast approaching the
replacement rate of 2.1 (the rate required merely to maintain a
constant population).
</P>
<P>
   _ A shrinking population in an aging developed world.
</P>
<P>
   Unless their fertility rates rebound, the total populations of
western Europe and Japan will shrink to about one-half of their
current size before the end of the next century.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, seven of the 12 most populous nations were in the
developed world: the United States, Russia, Japan, Germany, France,
Italy and the United Kingdom. The United Nations predicts that by
2050, only the United States will remain on that list. Nigeria,
Pakistan, Ethiopia, Congo, Mexico and the Philippines will replace
the others.
</P>
<P>
   _ From worker shortage to rising immigration pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most predictable consequence will be the rising
demand for immigrant workers in older and wealthier societies
facing labor shortages. Immigrants are typically young and tend to
bring with them the family practices of their native culture _
including higher fertility rates.
</P>
<P>
   In many European countries, non-European foreigners already make
up roughly 10 percent of the population. This includes 10 million
to 13 million Muslims, nearly all of whom are working-age or
younger. In Germany, foreigners will make up 30 percent of the
total population by 2030, and more than half the population of
major cities such as Munich and Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   Global aging and attendant labor shortages will therefore ensure
that immigration remains a major issue in developed countries for
decades to come. Culture wars could erupt over language and
religion. Electorates could divide along ethnic lines and emigre
leaders could sway foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Within 30 years, developed countries may have to spend at least
an extra 9 percent to 16 percent of gross domestic product simply
to meet their old-age benefit promises. The unfunded liabilities
for pensions (that is, benefits already earned by today's workers
for which nothing has been saved) are already almost $35 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Add in health care, and the total jumps to at least twice as
much. At minimum, the global aging issue thus represents, to
paraphrase the old quiz show, a $64 trillion question hanging over
the developed world's future.
</P>
<P>
   To pay for promised benefits through increased taxation is
unfeasible. Doing so would raise the total tax burden by an
unthinkable 25 percent to 40 percent of every worker's taxable
wages _ in countries where payroll tax rates sometimes already
exceed 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To finance the costs of these benefits by borrowing would be
just as disastrous. Governments would run unprecedented deficits
that would quickly consume the savings of the developed world.
</P>
<P>
   And the $64 trillion estimate is probably low. It likely
underestimates future growth in longevity and health-care costs and
ignores the negative effects on the economy of more borrowing,
higher interest rates, values, less savings and lower rates of
productivity and wage growth.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to respond to the aging challenge will destabilize the
global economy, straining financial and political institutions
around the world. As they age, some nations will do little to
change course, while others may succeed in boosting their national
savings rate, at least temporarily, through a combination of fiscal
restraint and household thrift. Yet this too could result in a
volatile disequilibrium in supply and demand for global capital.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter-century from now, will the divide between today's
``rich'' and ``poor'' nations be better described as a divide
between growth and decline, surplus and deficit, expansion and
retreat, future and past? By the mid-2020s, will the contrast
between North and South be better described as a contrast between
Young and Old?
</P>
<P>
   Countries where populations are still exploding rank high on any
list of potential trouble spots, whereas the countries most likely
to lose population are the staunchest friends of liberal democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In many parts of the developing world, the total fertility rate
remains very high (7.3 in the Gaza Strip versus 2.7 in Israel),
most people are very young (49 percent under age 15 in Uganda), and
the population is growing very rapidly (doubling every 26 years in
Iran).
</P>
<P>
   These areas also tend to be the poorest, most rapidly
urbanizing, most institutionally unstable _ and most likely to fall
under the sway of rogue leadership. They are the same societies
that spawned most of the military strongmen and terrorists who have
bedeviled the United States and Europe in recent decades.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's long-term planners predict that outbreaks of
regional anarchy will occur more frequently early in the next
century. To pinpoint when and where, they track what they call
``youth bulges'' in the world's poorest urban centers.
</P>
<P>
   Is demography destiny, after all? Is the rapidly aging developed
world fated to decline? Must it cede leadership to younger and
faster-growing societies?
</P>
<P>
   For the answer to be no, the developed world must redefine that
role around a new mission. How governments ultimately prepare for
global aging will also depend on how global aging itself reshapes
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Already some of the largest and most strident interest groups in
the United States are those that claim to speak for senior
citizens, such as the American Association of Retired Persons, with
its 33 million members, 1,700 paid employees, ten times that many
trained volunteers, and an annual budget of $5.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Senior power is rising in Europe, where it manifests itself less
through independent senior organizations than in labor unions and
(often union-affiliated) political parties that formally adopt
pro-retiree platforms. Could age-based political parties be the
wave of the future?
</P>
<P>
   Global aging could trigger a crisis that engulfs the world
economy. This crisis may even threaten democracy itself. The gray
dawn approaches. We must establish new ways of thinking and new
institutions to help us prepare for a much older world.

replacement rate of 2.1 (the rate required merely to maintain a
constant population).
</P>
<P>
   _ A shrinking population in an aging developed world.
</P>
<P>
   Unless their fertility rates rebound, the total populations of
western Europe and Japan will shrink to about one-half of their
current size before the end of the next century.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, seven of the 12 most populous nations were in the
developed world: the United States, Russia, Japan, Germany, France,
Italy and the United Kingdom. The United Nations predicts that by
2050, only the United States will remain on that list. Nigeria,
Pakistan, Ethiopia, Congo, Mexico and the Philippines will replace
the others.
</P>
<P>
   _ From worker shortage to rising immigration pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most predictable consequence will be the rising
demand for immigrant workers in older and wealthier societies
facing labor shortages. Immigrants are typically young and tend to
bring with them the family practices of their native culture _
including higher fertility rates.
</P>
<P>
   In many European countries, non-European foreigners already make
up roughly 10 percent of the population. This includes 10 million
to 13 million Muslims, nearly all of whom are working-age or
younger. In Germany, foreigners will make up 30 percent of the
total population by 2030, and more than half the population of
major cities such as Munich and Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   Global aging and attendant labor shortages will therefore ensure
that immigration remains a major issue in developed countries for
decades to come. Culture wars could erupt over language and
religion. Electorates could divide along ethnic lines and emigre
leaders could sway foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Within 30 years, developed countries may have to spend at least
an extra 9 percent to 16 percent of gross domestic product simply
to meet their old-age benefit promises. The unfunded liabilities
for pensions (that is, benefits already earned by today's workers
for which nothing has been saved) are already almost $35 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Add in health care, and the total jumps to at least twice as
much. At minimum, the global aging issue thus represents, to
paraphrase the old quiz show, a $64 trillion question hanging over
the developed world's future.
</P>
<P>
   To pay for promised benefits through increased taxation is
unfeasible. Doing so would raise the total tax burden by an
unthinkable 25 percent to 40 percent(of every worker's taxable
wages _ in countries where payroll tax rates sometimes already
exceed 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To finance the costs of these benefits by borrowing would be
just as disastrous. Governments would run unprecedented deficits
that would quickly consume the savings of the developed world.
</P>
<P>
   And the $64 trillion estimate is probably low. It likely
underestimates future growth in longevity and health-care costs and
ignores the negative effects on the economy of more borrowing,
higher interest rates, values, less savings and lower rates of
productivity and wage growth.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to respond to the aging challenge will destabilize the
global economy, straining financial and political institutions
around the world. As they age, some nations will do little to
change course, while others may succeed in boosting their national
savings rate, at least temporarily, through a combination of fiscal
restraint and household thrift. Yet this too could result in a
volatile disequilibrium in supply and demand for global capital.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter-century from now, will the divide between today's
``rich'' and ``poor'' nations be better described as a divide
between growth and decline, surplus and deficit, expansion and
retreat, future and past? By the mid-2020s, will the contrast
between North and South be better described as a contrast between
Young and Old?
</P>
<P>
   Countries where populations are still exploding rank high on any
list of potential trouble spots, whereas the countries most likely
to lose population are the staunchest friends of liberal democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In many parts of the developing world, the total fertility rate
remains very high (7.3 in the Gaza Strip versus 2.7 in Israel),
most people are very young (49 percent under age 15 in Uganda), and
the population is growing very rapidly (doubling every 26 years in
Iran).
</P>
<P>
   These areas also tend to be the poorest, most rapidly
urbanizing, most institutionally unstable _ and most likely to fall
under tie sway of rogue leadership. They are the same societies
that spawned most of the military strongmen and terrorists who have
bedeviled the United States and Europe in recent decades.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's long-term planners predict that outbreaks of
regional anarchy will occur more frequently early in the next
century. To pinpoint when and where, they track what they call
``youth bulges'' in the world's poorest urban centers.
</P>
<P>
   Is demography destiny, after all? Is the rapidly aging developed
world fated to decline? Must it cede leadership to younger and
faster-growing societies?
</P>
<P>
   For the answer to be no, the developed world must redefine that
role around a new mission. How governments ultimately prepare for
global aging will also depend on how global aging itself reshapes
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Already some of the largest and most strident interest groups in
the United States are those that claim to speak for senior
citizens, such as the American Association of Retired Persons, with
its 33 million members, 1,700 paid employees, ten times that many
trained volunteers, and an annual budget of $5.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Senior power is rising in Europe, where it manifests itself less
through independent senior organizations than in labor unions and
(often union-affiliated) political parties that formally adopt
pro-retiree platforms. Could age-based political parties be the
wave of the future?
</P>
<P>
   Global aging could trigger a crisis that engulfs the world
economy. This crisis may even threaten democracy itself. The gray
dawn approaches. We must establish new ways of thinking and new
institutions to help us prepare for a much older world.

<P>
   It has been suggested that males, in our species and others, are
more prone to violence than females.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, despite the current academic bias against genetic
explanations for behavior, this evidence does show that males are
indeed more likely to fight, murder, loot, pillage and, of course,
rape, than females.
</P>
<P>
   The question remains, however, whether this apparently innate
male predilection has much to do with war, international relations
and politics.
</P>
<P>
   In the anthropology of war, there is little basis for locating
the wellspring of war in aggressive male instincts _ or in any
instincts, for that matter. Wars are not barroom brawls writ large,
but, as social theorist Robin Fox puts it, ``complicated,
orchestrated, highly organized'' collective undertakings that
cannot be explained by any individual impulse.
</P>
<P>
   No plausible instinct would impel a man to leave his home, cut
his hair short and drill for hours under the hot sun. As
anthropologists Clifton B. Kroeber and Bernard L. Fontana have
pointed out, ``It is a large step from what may be biologically
innate leanings toward individual aggression to ritualized,
socially sanctioned, institutionalized group warfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as a 1989 conference on the anthropology of war concluded,
``The hypothesis of a killer instinct is ... not so much irrelevant
as wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the male appetite for battle has always been far less
voracious than either biologically inclined theorists of war or
army commanders might like. In traditional societies, warriors
often had to be taunted, intoxicated or ritually ``transformed''
into animal form before battle.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Western history, individual men have gone to
near-suicidal lengths to avoid participating in wars _ cutting off
fingers or limbs or risking execution by deserting. Prior to the
advent of the nationalist armies of the 19th century, desertion
rates in European armies were so high that, according to historian
Geoffrey Parker, ``at certain times, almost an entire army would
vanish into thin air.''
</P>
<P>
   So unreliable and prone to escape was the rank and file of the
famed 18th-century Prussian army that military manuals forbade
allowing the men to camp near wooded areas. Even in the supposedly
highly motivated armies of the 20th-century democracies, few men
can bring themselves to shoot directly at individual enemies _ a
fact, as Lt. Col. Dave Grossman writes in ``On Killing: The
Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society,'' that
has posed a persistent challenge to the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, we need not resort to instinctual male
aggressiveness to explain the male near-monopoly on warfare. One
reason is clearly biological, resting on men's advantage in upper
body strength _ an undeniable plus when the weapons of war are
heavy swords, spears, pikes, maces or clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Another explanation is cultural, or at least as purely cultural
as one can be: In many, if not most, human societies, male
initiation rites feature acts of violence committed by or on the
initiates, and one of the most common of these rites has been
participation in battle.
</P>
<P>
   Through ``blooding a spear'' a boy proved his manhood (or
through ordering the bombing of some smaller nation, in the case of
recent American presidents). For an activity to be a male
initiatory rite, it cannot, of course, be open to women and girls.
Hence the widespread taboos on female handling of weapons and, in
many cases, the tools of peaceable male-dominated crafts.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no reason to think that such initiatory activities
derive from instinctual male proclivities. In some cultural
settings, the young male's initiation to the adult world may be
entirely bloodless, featuring the receipt of a diploma or admission
into a guild.
</P>
<P>
   In others it may be violent in ways not related to war,
involving circumcision, homosexual rape or nose-bleeding induced
with sharp sticks _ activities that few would say are instinctually
driven.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the very purpose of male initiation rites is to
distinguish biological maleness, which undoubtedly includes a
healthy desire for self-preservation, from cultural manhood, which
requires a certain amount of self-discipline and even
self-sacrifice for the group (as does cultural womanhood).
</P>
<P>
   Nor can it be assumed that the male monopoly on warfare has been
eternal and universal.
</P>
<P>
   Gravesites recently excavated in Russia contain the remains of
women warriors from the second millennium B.C. _ female skeletons
buried with weapons and bearing wounds inflicted by similar
weapons. The victims of the famous Neolithic massacre at Jebel
Sahaba included both women and men, and there is no evidence that
the perpetrators were exclusively male.
</P>
<P>
   Moving back into the Paleolithic Age, when hunting was probably
the principal form of human violence, growing archaeological
evidence suggests that it was a communal enterprise in which women
and children joined men in driving herds over cliffs into nets or
culs-de-sac.
</P>
<P>
   The male-centered hunting strategy that figured so prominently
in the writings of sociobiologists in the 1960s and '70s _ in which
a small band of men stalks an individual animal _ may be a rather
recent innovation, necessitated by declining game populations in
the Mesolithic Age.
</P>
<P>
   In ancient civilizations, some of the earliest deities
worshipped by humans were female, but they were hardly the
nurturing earth mothers imagined by many scholars. The archaic
goddesses unearthed from Mesopotamian ruins or recalled in
Mesoamerican mythology were huntresses and avid consumers of blood
sacrifices, often accompanied or represented by predators such as
lions and leopards.
</P>
<P>
   Only later were these terrifying deities ``tamed'' through
marriage to patriarchical male gods and reassigned to agricultural
duties. Although the characteristics of the archaic goddesses tell
us nothing about the roles of actual women, they do suggest a time
when the association of manhood with violence and femininity with
gentlemen was not as self-evident as it has seemed in the modern
age.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever our genetic and prehistoric cultural legacies, women in
the past two centuries have more than adequately demonstrated a
capacity for collective violence. They have played a leading role
in nonmilitary violence such as 18th- and 19th-century bread riots
and revolutionary uprisings, in which they were often reputed to be
``foremost in violence and ferocity.''
</P>
<P>
   In World War II, the Soviet military deployed them as fighter
pilots and in ground combat. Since then, women have served as
terrorists and guerilla fighters in wars of national liberation.
More to the point, women have proved themselves no less susceptible
than men to the passions of militaristic nationalism: witness
feminist leader Sylvia Pankhurst, who set aside the struggle for
suffrage to mobilize English support for World War I by, for
example, publicly shaming men into enlisting.
</P>
<P>
   Among heads of government, Margaret Thatcher is an exception to
the gender dichotomy. Among the many exceptions on the male side of
the ledger are the anti-militaristic, social-democratic Olaf Palme
and Willy Brandt. And of course the greatest pacifist leaders of
the 20th century were male: Martin Luther King Jr. and Mohandas K.
Gandhi.
</P>
<P>
   Inherent aggressiveness of men and niceness of women? Perhaps
one thing is true: Whatever the innate psychological differences
between the sexes, a certain male propensity for chest-thumping
persists _ and it can be found among desk-dwelling American
scholars as well as alpha apes.

<P>
   Recent events have given the lie to the conventional wisdom on
civil wars: that they are private matters which great powers may
simply ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 10 years, America has again and again found itself
in the middle of foreign, internal conflicts, from Haiti to
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   And nowhere has the focus been so acute or the consequences as
immediate as in the Balkans. The United States and its Western
allies have worked hard _ though with limited success _ to end the
wars that erupted when Yugoslavia collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Western interests were directly implicated; concern over
humanitarian abuses, the risk of war spreading to neighboring
states and the future of NATO justified American and European
intervention. The Dayton accords seemed to win a fragile peace for
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   But the threat of war in Europe now looms as likely as ever, as
elections return Bosnian hard-liners to office and the uprising
tragically flares in Kosovo. The prospects of achieving a lasting
peace in the region are slim, and these problems are likely to vex
American policymakers for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   The attention paid by the West to the wars in the former
Yugoslavia should come as no surprise. Only recently have
superpowers refrained from involvement in internal conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally the case has been just the opposite. And with good
reason: revolutions in France, Russia and China sparked profound
changes in the international system that remain with us today.
</P>
<P>
   During the Cold War, internal conflicts in Korea and Vietnam
drew the United States into costly interventions, while domestic
strife in El Salvador and Nicaragua dominated American foreign
policy through the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, for the Soviet Union, internal wars provided the
source for both one of Moscow's greatest victories (Cuba) and one
of its most costly defeats (Afghanistan).
</P>
<P>
   Since the collapse of the USSR (brought on in part by the Afghan
disaster) and the end of the Cold War, new questions must be asked
about civil wars and American interests. Proxy fights between
Russia and America are no longer likely. The domino effect is no
longer a concern.
</P>
<P>
   Though wars within states continue to outnumber those fought
between them, many now argue that the United States should turn its
back on these internal squabbles. These civil wars, they argue, are
the domestic affairs of poor, weak countries, not important enough
to merit American involvement. Getting enmeshed in complicated
disputes and age-old hatreds will sap American resources _ and for
no good reason.
</P>
<P>
   There is something to this view. Most civil wars do not directly
threaten the United States or its allies. While recent internal
conflicts have raised humanitarian concerns, none has seriously
affected American security or economic interests. This, however,
was largely a matter of luck.
</P>
<P>
   The United States should recognize a vital and sobering truth:
that not only the former Yugoslavia, but also Russia, Mexico and
Saudi Arabia all now stand on the brink of civil war, conflicts
that would have devastating consequences for the United States.
These consequences are not the traditional dangers of
state-to-state aggression, such as outside attack or invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Though largely ignored by scholars and policymakers, who remain
fixated on the idea of international conflict, internal war has
emerged as a principal threat to security in the post-Cold War
world.
</P>
<P>
   Conflicts may foment within the borders of a single state, and
yet in this day and age they send shock waves far beyond their
frontiers. To begin with, internal wars risk destroying assets the
United States needs. Were the Persian Gulf oil fields destroyed in
a Saudi civil war, the American economy (and those of the rest of
the developed world) would suffer severely.
</P>
<P>
   Internal wars can also unleash threats that stable governments
formerly held in check. As central governments weaken and fall,
weapons of mass destruction may fall into the hands of rogue
leaders or anti-American factions. More directly, internal wars
endanger American citizens living and traveling abroad. Liberia
will not be the last place America sends helicopters to rescue its
stranded citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, internal wars, when they erupt on U.S. borders,
threaten to destabilize America itself. U.S. intervention in Haiti
was spurred, in large part, by fear of the flood of refugees poised
to enter the United States.
</P>
<P>
   All of these dangers are grave enough to warrant consideration;
what makes them even more serious is the fact that their impact on
America is largely unintended. Being unintended, the spill-off
effects of the world's civil wars are not easily deterred, which
creates unique challenges to American interests.
</P>
<P>
   Fundamentally, Washington must recognize that future threats
will be qualitatively different from traditional challenges. During
the Cold War, an enormous amount of military, economic and
scholarly effort went into deterring a Soviet invasion of Western
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   America did not then hesitate to protect itself. The prospect of
internal war erupting in key states is now just as likely as was
that of Soviet troops pouring through the Fulda Gap, and the
consequences would be just as catastrophic.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the U.S. government gives internal war only a tiny
fraction of the attention it once paid to the Soviet threat. With
the Cold War over and internal wars virtually the only form of
battle being fought, scholars and policymakers need to shift gears
and recognize that not all threats to security are deliberate,
purposeful acts of a coherent enemy that can be deterred with the
right policy.
</P>
<P>
   Civil wars _ whether in Kosovo or Moscow _ could inadvertently
unleash catastrophic harms. Because these risks are so hard to
prevent, they must now get the analysis and attention they so
urgently deserve.
</P>
<P>
   Though the inadvertent side effects of internal conflicts cannot
be deterred, the outbreak of civil war itself may be discouraged.
Doing so may require unambiguous and generous American support for
a regime that finds itself under assault. Or it may require
Washington to ease out unsustainable leaders once their time has
clearly passed.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the difficulties of preventing internal war pale in
comparison to the problems of coping with its effects.

<P>
   Recent events have given the lie to the conventional wisdom on
civil wars: that they are private matters which great powers may
simply ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 10 years, America has again and again found itself
in the middle of foreign, internal conflicts, from Haiti to
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   And nowhere has the focus been so acute or the consequences as
immediate as in the Balkans. The United States and its Western
allies have worked hard _ though with limited success _ to end the
wars that erupted when Yugoslavia collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Western interests were directly implicated; concern over
humanitarian abuses, the risk of war spreading to neighboring
states and the future of NATO justified American and European
intervention. The Dayton accords seemed to win a fragile peace for
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   But the threat of war in Europe now looms as likely as ever, as
elections return Bosnian hard-liners to office and the uprising
tragically flares in Kosovo. The prospects of achieving a lasting
peace in the region are slim, and these problems are likely to vex
American policymakers for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   The attention paid by the West to the wars in the former
Yugoslavia should come as no surprise. Only recently have
superpowers refrained from involvement in internal conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally the case has been just the opposite. And with good
reason: revolutions in France, Russia and China sparked profound
changes in the international system that remain with us today.
</P>
<P>
   During the Cold War, internal conflicts in Korea and Vietnam
drew the United States into costly interventions, while domestic
strife in El Salvador and Nicaragua dominated American foreign
policy through the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, for the Soviet Union, internal wars provided the
source for both one of Moscow's greatest victories (Cuba) and one

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Today Russia is closer to bloody conflict than it ever has been
since the terrible civil war of 1918-20.
</P>
<P>
   For 70 years, the Soviet Union operated a strong state
apparatus, anchored by the KGB and the Communist Party. Now its
disintegration has created a power vacuum that has yet to be
filled.
</P>
<P>
   By now, the fledgling government confronts a vast array of
problems without the power to take effective action. Unable to rely
on popular ideology or coercion to establish control, the
government must prove itself to the people and establish its
authority on the basis of its performance.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yeltsin administration has abjectly failed to do so, and
it cannot meet the most basic needs of the Russian people. Russians
know they can no longer look to the state for personal security,
law enforcement, education, sanitation, health care or even
electrical power.
</P>
<P>
   In the place of government authority, criminal groups _ the
Russian mafiya _ increasingly hold sway. Expectations raised by the
collapse of communism have been bitterly disappointed, and Moscow's
inability to govern coherently raises the specter of civil unrest.
</P>
<P>
   If internal war does strike Russia, economic deterioration will
be a prime cause. From 1989 to the present, the gross domestic
product has fallen by 50 percent. In a society where, 10 years ago,
unemployment scarcely existed, it reached 9.5 percent in 1997 with
many economists declaring the true figure to be much higher.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two percent of Russians live below the official poverty
line (earning less than $70 a month). Modern Russia can neither
collect taxes (it gathers only half the revenue it is due) nor
significantly cut spending.
</P>
<P>
   Reformers tout privatization as the country's cure-all, but in a
land without well-defined property rights or contract law and where
subsidies remain a way of life, the prospects for transition to an
American-style capitalist economy look remote at best.
</P>
<P>
   As the massive devaluation of the ruble and the current
political crisis show, Russia's condition is even worse than most
analysts feared. If conditions get worse, even the stoic Russian
people will soon run out of patience.
</P>
<P>
   A future conflict would quickly draw in Russia's military. In
the Soviet days civilian rule kept the powerful armed forces in
check. But with the Communist Party out of office, what little
civilian control remains relies on an exceedingly fragile
foundation _ personal friendships between government leaders and
military commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the morale of Russian soldiers has fallen to a
dangerous low. Drastic cuts in spending mean inadequate pay,
housing and medical care. A new emphasis on domestic missions has
created an ideological split between the old and new guard in the
military leadership, increasing the risk that disgruntled generals
may enter the political fray and feeding the resentment of soldiers
who dislike being used as a national police force.
</P>
<P>
   Newly enhanced ties between military units and local authorities
pose another danger. Soldiers grow ever more dependent on local
governments for housing, food and wages. Draftees serve closer to
home, and new laws have increased local control over the armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Were a conflict to emerge between a regional power and Moscow,
it is not at all clear which side the military would support.
Divining the military's allegiance is crucial, however, since the
structure of the Russian Federation makes it virtually certain that
regional conflicts will continue to erupt.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's 89 republics grow ever more independent in a system
that does little to keep them together. As the central government
finds itself unable to force its will beyond Moscow (if even that
far), power devolves to the periphery.
</P>
<P>
   With the economy collapsing, republics feel less and less
incentive to pay taxes to Moscow when they receive so little in
return. Three-quarters of them already have their own
constitutions, nearly all of which make some claim to sovereignty.
Strong ethnic bonds promoted by shortsighted Soviet policies may
motivate non-Russians to secede from the Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Chechnya's successful revolt against Russian control inspired
similar movements for autonomy and independence throughout the
country. If these rebellions spread and Moscow responds with force,
civil war is likely.
</P>
<P>
   Should Russia succumb to internal war, the consequences for the
United States and Europe will be severe. A major power like Russia
_ even though in decline _ does not suffer civil war quietly or
alone.
</P>
<P>
   An embattled Russian Federation might provoke opportunistic
attacks from enemies such as China. Massive flows of refugees would
pour into central and western Europe. Armed struggles in Russia
could easily spill into its neighbors. Damage from the fighting,
particularly attacks on nuclear plants, would poison the
environment of much of Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Within Russia, the consequences would be even worse. Just as the
sheer brutality of the last Russian civil war laid the basis for
the privations of Soviet communism, a second civil war might
produce another horrific regime.
</P>
<P>
   Most alarming is the real possibility that the violent
disintegration of Russia could lead to loss of control over its
nuclear arsenal. No nuclear state has ever fallen victim to civil
war, but even without a clear precedent the grim consequences can
be foreseen.
</P>
<P>
   Russia retains some 20,000 nuclear weapons and the raw material
for tens of thousands more, in scores of sites scattered throughout
the country. So far, the government has managed to prevent the loss
of any weapons or much materiel. If war erupts, however, Moscow's
already weak grip on nuclear sites will slacken, making weapons and
supplies available to a wide range of anti-American groups and
states.
</P>
<P>
   Such dispersal of nuclear weapons represents the greatest
physical threat America now faces. And it is hard to think of
anything that would increase this threat more than the chaos that
would follow a Russian civil war.
</P>
<P>
   America must reduce the chances that civil conflict in Russia
will unleash nuclear weapons against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   _ First, Washington must do more to reduce the amount of nuclear
weapons and fissionable material that could be lost, stolen, or
used in the chaos of civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The Nunn-Lugar program, under which the United States buys
Russian nuclear material to use and store in America, is a good
start, but it must be accelerated. America should not worry about
making a profit on the plutonium and enriched uranium it buys, but
just get the goods out of Russia as fast as possible.
</P>
<P>
   _ Second, arms-control initiatives that may have been
unpalatable during the Cold War should now be reconsidered, given
the risk of accidental or unauthorized launchings.
</P>
<P>
   American policymakers should contemplate agreements to reduce
the total number of Russian (and American) nuclear weapons, to
deprive the Russians of the ability to quickly launch a nuclear
strike (for example, by contracting to store warheads away from
missiles), and should intensify efforts to develop an effective
defense against missile attacks.

supplies available to a wide range of anti-American groups and
states.
</P>
<P>
   Such dispersal of nuclear weapons represents the greatest
physical threat America now faces. And it is hard to think of
anything that would increase this threat more than the chaos that
would follow a Russian civil war.
</P>
<P>
   America must reduce the chances that civil conflict in Russia
will unleash nuclear weapons against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   _ First, Washington must do more to reduce the amount of nuclear
weapons and fissionable material that could be lost, stolen, or
used in the chaos of civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The Nunn-Lugar program, under which the United States buys
Russian nuclear material to use and store in America, is a good
start, but it must be accelerated. America should not worry about
making a profit on the plutonium and enriched uranium it buys, but
just get the goods out of Russia as fast as possible.
</P>
<P>
   _ Second, arms-control initiatives that may have been
unpalatable during the Cold War should now be reconsidered, given
the risk of accidental or unauthorized launchings.
</P>
<P>
   American policymakers should contemplate agreements to reduce
the total number of Russian (and American) nuclear weapons, to
deprive the Russians of the ability to quickly launch a nuclear
strike (for example, by contracting to store warheads away from
missiles), and should intensify efforts to develop an effective
defense against missile attacks.

GORE COURTS CALIFORNIA WITH CASH AND PROMISES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 and MACKENZIE WARREN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Vice President Al Gore has become a regular
fixture in California, delivering federal largess and apparently
sending the message to fellow Democrats that when it comes to
votes, he owns the state.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who is preparing to run for the presidency in 2000, has
visited vote-rich California at least 52 times since he took office
six years ago, including two trips this month in which he again
brought promises of cash from Uncle Sam.
</P>
<P>
   In events Monday in San Francisco and Sacramento, Gore announced
the Clinton administration's intent to restore $1.3 billion in
health and welfare benefits cut off to legal immigrants in 1996.
Gore also promised $400 million to modernize a network of global
positioning satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Gore announced federal aid to help California
orange farmers harmed by freezing weather, and in a Sacramento
event Monday, the vice president announced $43 million to help
crime victims pay medical bills and other costs.
</P>
<P>
   In a September trip to the state, Gore announced $1.9 million in
grants to help the police fight domestic violence. Also last year,
he toured a San Francisco airport hanger earlier and announced $100
million for new bomb detectors at the nation's airports.
</P>
<P>
   By making showing up in California to announce the federal
largess, Gore can travel at taxpayer expense. He visited Los
Angeles on Sunday, announcing $366 million in federal funding for
information technology research, and a tax credit for research and
development.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, it boosts Gore's profile in a state that holds an
awesome 54 electoral votes in presidential elections. With the
California primary 14 months away, Gore is attempting to claim his
turf against other potential Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the state party is sending a discouraging message to
other possible Democratic presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're looking at a tight squeeze here,'' said Art Torres, the
state Democratic Party chairman. ``I think it's going to be
absolutely impossible for another candidate to get to where Gore is
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was scoring points Monday with Hispanics, who were livid at
the welfare cuts to legal immigrants and emerged as a crucial
voting bloc in the state's general election last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton and I made a solemn promise to this nation
that we would remove these harmful provisions,'' Gore said. ``We
are following through on that promise.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a center for senior citizens in San Francisco's
Chinatown, Gore said the administration would seek disability,
health and nutrition benefits in the budget the president submits
to Congress on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Among the provisions the administration is seeking is a
restoration of Supplemental Security Income and Medicaid
eligibility to more than 50,000 legal immigrants who entered the
United States after Aug. 22, 1996, the date when welfare reform
legislation became law _ and shut out hundreds of thousands of
legal immigrants from various social benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the $930 million proposal would allow people who
arrived after the deadline to be eligible once again as early as
2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``No child should be forced to suffer when their parents came
here seeking a better life,'' Gore said in a news conference at the
Chinatown center.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said she thought the proposals
would be approved by the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a fight,'' Pelosi said. ``But I'm optimistic. I
think we'll be successful.''

THE BEGINNING OF THE ENDGAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT 
c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - When three members of the House prosecution team
told the media circus gathered around Monica Lewinsky that she
would be a good witness, they undercut their credibility with the
Senate one more time.
</P>
<P>
   Had the House Republican 3 _ Bill McCollum of Florida, Ed Bryant
of Tennessee, and Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas _ had the good sense
to say something neutral, Lewinsky's lawyer, Plato Cacheris, might
have let them off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   But as Cacheris watched them go beyond the facts once more, he
had no choice but to set the record straight. Nothing different
from her 22 previous appearances and sworn statements, Cacheris
said bluntly. There's nothing substantive to add, he said, so
please tell your superiors (a lovely insult) to lay off and let her
have a chance at a life.
</P>
<P>
   It was the beginning of the endgame, and Henry Hyde's minions
had once again stuck their necks out in public with a tale that
could be contradicted simply by the facts.
</P>
<P>
   The Monica incident was not the only one in town that evening.
House managers also spent time with the least credible practitioner
in the political game, former Clinton adviser Dick Morris, as they
attempted to cobble together a list of deposition witnesses that
might have a chance of Senate approval.
</P>
<P>
   In the trial presentations, however, the managers themselves had
already poisoned that well with their most astonishing
prevarication of all.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Bryant had been the offender, and his offense over the
weekend was to twist the facts. Bryant had supplied what appeared
to be a grand jury testimony-based narrative of a phone call
between President Clinton and Morris as the sex scandal was
breaking a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, once the US attorney for western Tennessee, informed the
Senate on Friday that Morris's testimony had been that Clinton told
him he was preparing to hold a press conference trashing Lewinsky
but that Morris had urged caution before taking such a dramatic and
irrevocable step.
</P>
<P>
   And then Bryant sat down at the managers' table, and no one said
a thing.
</P>
<P>
   At the other table, the presidential attorneys could not believe
their ears _ or their luck. The next day, White House counsel
Charles Ruff seized on another version of the ``trashing'' theory
from Representative Jim Rogan of California to pounce.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Bryant's narrative, Ruff simply read from Page 127
of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's referral to the House,
describing Morris's account of his second chat with the president:
</P>
<P>
   ``When Mr. Morris was considering holding a press conference to
`blast Monica Lewinsky out of the water,' the president told Mr.
Morris to `be careful.' According to Mr. Morris, the president
warned him not to be too hard on (Miss Lewinsky).''
</P>
<P>
   ``One hundred eighty degrees off,'' deadpanned Ruff.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast this with Ruff's behavior when he got caught trying to
ignore unpleasant facts in his own presentation on the witness
tampering charge that is part of the obstruction of justice
impeachment article. The White House argument had not dealt either
with a second Clinton-Betty Currie meeting after his deposition in
the Paula Jones case or with the fact Currie had been subpoenaed as
a potential witness in the case after the scandal broke in the
press.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff immediately apologized for his effort to be too cute by
half and thus misleading. That confession, however, then gave him
standing to rebut the material _ noting that after the headlines
the Jones lawyers had in fact issued a blizzard of Lewinsky-related
motions (Currie's subpoena was No. 163) in the closing days of
discovery, and that eight days after the first story, the judge in
the case ruled all Lewinsky material immaterial to it.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the endgame melodrama is dominated by opinion
polls, fatigue, exasperation, scenarios _ in short, by politics.
But beneath the surface is the most important reason of all why
more than a few Republicans have edged toward a willingness to pull
the trial's plug.
</P>
<P>
   It was on vivid display still again last Saturday as Hutchinson
sought to paint presidential friend Vernon Jordan as a crook by
presenting ``evidence'' that Jordan had told the grand jury ``you
didn't have to be an Einstein'' to realize that once Lewinsky was
subpoenaed in the Jones case in mid-December 1997, that his job
search and her effort to avoid telling the truth were related.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton attorney David Kendall noted, this deliberately
misstated Jordan's repeated testimony that the subpoena caused him
to get (false) assurances from Clinton and Lewinsky that they had
no relationship and only then to continue with the job and other
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The problem here is called bad faith, and it has proved fatal to
the House case, as it should.

HELPING GREECE CATCH ON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS _ As host of the 2004 Olympics, Greece automatically gets
to enter its baseball team in the competition, without having to
qualify. Which is fine, but Greece doesn't have a baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   Or a baseball stadium. Or a coach. Or bats. Or baseball fans,
for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Red Sox and the Baltimore Orioles are about to change
that.
</P>
<P>
   As a gesture of good will, the teams plan to send several
coaches and players to train Greek players when the 1999 season
ends in the United States. In addition, the Major League Baseball
Commissioner's office has offered to help refurbish several rutted,
rock-strewn baseball fields on an abandoned US military base
outside Athens.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to instill a love of baseball in the cradle of
Western thought. More immediately, everyone wants to form a team
that won't embarrass Greece as it holds the Games for the first
time since it hosted the debut of the modern Olympics in 1896.
</P>
<P>
   The idea came from US Ambassador R. Nicholas Burns, who is, to
put it undiplomatically, a nut about baseball. He may be the only
ambassador anywhere who displays Carl Yastrzemski and Carlton Fisk
baseball cards right by the requisite portraits of President
Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright.
</P>
<P>
   During a conversation last year with officials from Greek's
Ministry of Sports, Burns turned the conversation to baseball, as
he often does.
</P>
<P>
   Burns inquired about the preparations for baseball in 2004. The
government officials conceded that although Greece has
extraordinary soccer and basketball teams, it lacks baseball
players, particularly catchers, pitchers, outfielders, and anyone
who knows what ``batting stance'' means.
</P>
<P>
   Burns sought the assistance of Paul Beeston, president of Major
League Baseball, and Lou Gorman, Red Sox executive consultant and
former general manager. He also called Orioles owner Peter Angelos,
a Greek American. All agreed to contribute money, materials, and
advisers to help with baseball diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   In an oversight, perhaps, the ambassador from Wellesley, Mass.,
neglected to contact George Steinbrenner, the deep-pocketed owner
of the world champion Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe George would have been glad to help,'' Beeston
said last week from New York. ``Maybe the ambassador has too many
bad memories of Red Sox-Yankees games.''
</P>
<P>
   Beeston said baseball management is excited about the chance to
help Europe catch up to the United States, Latin America, and Japan
in baseball fever. The commissioner's office may send coaches and
trainers from minor league teams, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to promote baseball as much as we can,'' said Lou
Gorman, of the Red Sox. ``When it gets spread all over the whole
world, maybe we'll have a real World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns put out the word among Hellenic organizations about the
need for a few good ballplayers with Greek passports. Or, at the
very least, the heritage that would entitle them to play for
Greece.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got people coming out of the woodwork,'' he says as he
sits in his Athens residence, which is decorated with a model of
Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   At first, apparently, Greek officials assumed they would go to
the Major Leagues and recruit Greek-American players like, well,
what's-his-name. But Greek-Americans have not reached the
prominence in professional baseball that they have in politics, the
media, and the arts. The big leagues do not yet have a Michael
Dukakis, or Olympia Snowe, or George Stephanopolous, or Yanni, the
new age musician.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Burns's preliminary scouting report has identified
several up-and-coming Greek-American players on several campuses.
And the volunteers include Charles G. Samiotes and Bill Galatis,
who take part in the Red Sox Fantasy Camp in Fort Myers every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that we are pretty good ball players and would like to
be involved in the 2004 Olympics, as well as bringing baseball to
Greece,'' Samiotes, who is from Wayland, wrote in an e-mail to
Burns.
</P>
<P>
   Costas Bakouris, managing director of Athens 2004, which is
coordinating the Olympics in Greece, has watched with pleasure
while the ambassador works his Rolodex.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a Red Sox fan, you have a special relationship with
the team. . . . I don't know whether the word is fanatic, I don't
know if you're masochistic,'' Bakouris said at Athens 2004 Olympic
headquarters, which has plenty of pictures of swimmers and runners,
but none of outfielders or pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   In the interest of full disclosure, Bakouris mentions that he
went to college in Chicago and is a White Sox fan. ``I actually
like the Cubs, too,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   At the embassy, Burns is busy monitoring violence in the Balkans
and trying to ease tensions between Greece and its enemy Turkey. He
asked an assistant, Dave Simons, who usually oversees housing for
embassy employees, to be his point man on baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Simons, of Salt Lake City, doesn't know how Burns chose him, but
he assumes it has something to do his background as a Red Sox fan.
</P>
<P>
   The Greek government is building baseball and softball stadiums
and practice fields, which should be ready shortly before the
Olympics. That leaves aspiring players _ if any appear _ with no
place to play for the next few seasons. So one of Simons' first
stops was the old Hellinikon Air Base near Athens, which the US Air
Force deserted five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A pessimist would have seen four rusting backstops and rutted
baseball and softball diamonds that have been transformed to a
makeshift soccer field. That's exactly what Simons saw, and he's an
optimist.
</P>
<P>
   The only things holding the backstops together seem to be
weathered signs proclaiming that ``non-appropriated funds''
(donations, in layman's language) were used to build the baseball
emporium on the base.
</P>
<P>
   Still, like anyone who has cheered for the Red Sox at some
point, Simons is a believer. What he saw was not quite a field of
dreams, but a field of weeds with potential. ``It was kind of a
nostalgic experience,'' he says. ``It takes you back to the summers
when you were a kid buying Sno-Kones.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially if you were a kid on a military base blessed with
non-appropriated funds.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox have not decided which players to send over, and the
Orioles say they also will volunteer to help with training in the
off-season. Simons is working with the league management to
refurbish the fields, a project that is expected to start later
this year.
</P>
<P>
   One evening earlier this month, Simons looked out of his
apartment window and saw a sign, a harbinger, a message from
Spalding or Rawlings or Nike, the ancient gods of sport:
</P>
<P>
   In the fading, golden light of dusk, there stood three boys,
about 12 years old, laughing and playing catch with a baseball and
gloves.

AN IDEAL DECADE FOR ZERO TOLERANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's probably harder than you think to come up with an original
complaint about language. You're maddened by less when it should be
fewer, it's instead of its, and sportscasters saying ``they played
aggressive''? Join the club; millions of others feel your pain.
</P>
<P>
   But Thor Kirleis has a gripe I'd call almost unique, if that
weren't a forbidden phrase: The locution that drives him nuts is
our near-universal habit of saying oh (or O) for zero in dates and
other strings of numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather was born in nineteen eight,'' he writes, not in
``nineteen, oh, eight. . . . My Zip code is not oh, eighteen,
sixty-four, but zero, eighteen, sixty-four.'' (Most people would
say oh-one-eight-six-four, in my experience, but that's another
question.)
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the history behind this terribly misused word?''
Kirleis asks.
</P>
<P>
   Well, to abbreviate the history considerably, the answer is that
the ``misuse'' has been there from the start. No doubt because the
figure 0 and the letter O look so similar, zero was called oh by
the time of their earliest recorded citations: The first example of
zero in the Oxford English Dictionary is dated 1604, and the first
example of O to mean zero, nothing, a cipher, is from ``King
Lear,'' 1605.
</P>
<P>
   Zero as a concept had come late to Europe _ around 1200 _ and
its tardiness is one reason for our current millennium-dating
confusion: The sixth-century designer of the Christian calendar
went directly from 1 BC to AD 1, with no year zero in between.
Hence the year 2000 is the last of the second millennium, not the
first of the third millennium.
</P>
<P>
   But while England was adapting to the new math, it already had
naught (or nought) as a word for nothing, and that too was used to
mean zero, the Arabic numeral. Naught is now little used, but it
survives in noughts-and-crosses, the British name for tick-tack-toe
_ evidence that the mark we think of as the letter O is perceived
as a zero by English speakers across the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   So there's not much historical support for purism on the
zero-vs.-oh question _ and the decade that's hurtling our way will
be an especially difficult time for defenders of the faith. There's
been a lot of playful speculation about what we're going to call
the zero-laden years of the next decade, but nobody's predicting
that we'll say two-zero-zero-five; it's going to be either two
thousand (and) five or twenty-oh-five, and probably both.
</P>
<P>
   I had figured that 2001, at least, was locked in as ``Two
thousand and one,'' the usual rendition of the movie title ``2001:
A Space Odyssey,'' but just days ago I heard someone call it
``Twenty-oh-one.'' So I anticipate a lot of variations during the
oh-years, and the decade will probably be past before we reach a
consensus.
</P>
<P>
   Another sore point is likely to be that and in two thousand and
one. A kindergarten teacher wrote to say that she teaches her
pupils to count one hundred one, one hundred two, but wonders
whether one hundred and one is equally acceptable. It is, though
adding and is more informal than omitting it, and more common in
speech, where the extra word can provide a pause that may help your
listener.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, earlier this month, when radio host Christopher Lydon
and wordsman Richard Lederer were batting around names for the next
decade on WBUR's ``The Connection,'' a listener phoned to suggest
``the andies'' _ on the grounds that we would all be saying ``two
thousand and one,'' and so on, through 2010 or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``The andies'' isn't likely to win this war _ too obscure, too
reminiscent of undies and the Archies. Oh for zero, on the other
hand, is solidly established. As we grope toward a name for the new
decade, we'll surely find better issues to debate than the merits
of these useful little words.

O'BRIEN TURNS OHIO STATE INTO A SOLID WINNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ So you want to be a coach, eh?
</P>
<P>
   Barely 12 hours after his team has whomped Purdue by 29, Ohio
State coach Jim O'Brien is sitting at the wheel of his sport
utility vehicle with thoughts of Minnesota running through his
mind. Celebration time is over. A coach really inhabits only two
time frames _ the present and the future. His first thought is
seeing to it that his kids do not get carried away with the Purdue
game, and he must do so without breaking down their confidence. His
second thought concerns the immediate future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried about how we're going to guard Quincy Lewis,'' he
says, alluding to the Gophers' smooth 21-points-per-game small
forward. ``That's a tough matchup for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The essentials of coaching never change. When he was at St.
Bonaventure, he'd be worried about some kid at Niagara. When he was
at Boston College, he'd be concerned about a Georgetown Hoya or
Connecticut Husky. But settings and circumstances can be very
different. O'Brien now finds himself plugged into a very different
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was hired,'' he says, ``they talked about winning the
national championship. They did it once before, and they believe
they can do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State won the NCAA championship in 1960, and made it to the
championship game in each of the next two seasons. You can look it
up. The names of Jerry Lucas, John Havlicek, Larry Siegfried, and
Joe Roberts still have resonance here.
</P>
<P>
   But something has been amiss. Eldon Miller, Gary Williams, and
Randy Ayers combined to produce a mere eight 20-win seasons since
the sainted Fred Taylor left in 1976. The last NCAA tournament
appearance was in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. People in Columbus believe there is no reason Ohio
State basketball cannot rise again, and let's make one thing very
clear: No one can come in here and bitch about the facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few professional arenas are comparable,'' says O'Brien,
and the man speaks the truth. The 18,000-seat Value Center Arena at
Schottenstein Center is drop-dead gorgeous and comfy. If it's not
the best campus arena in America, let's just say there are none
better.
</P>
<P>
   Many a school would be satisfied with Ohio State's discard. St.
John Arena seats 13,000 and it's not exactly falling down. But when
Jerome Schottenstein knocks on the door and you've got a chance for
those delectable luxury boxes and all the requisite modern
amenities, you don't turn him away.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're Jim O'Brien, you don't turn away from doing
commercials for Kroger, a mammoth grocery chain and longtime Ohio
State backer. You also have the obligatory coach's TV and radio
shows, the latter broadcast throughout the state via OSU's
56-affilate network. There is constant exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did more speaking, and was invited to more events in one
year than in 11 at BC,'' O'Brien says.
</P>
<P>
   It's pretty much a case of ``Gee, Toto, we're not in Chestnut
Hill anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Did someone mention BC?
</P>
<P>
   There are but three pieces of evidence in his office to suggest
that 48-year-old Jim O'Brien has had another coaching life before
this one.
</P>
<P>
   The first is a Big East Coach of the Year trophy.
</P>
<P>
   The second is a photo of Howard Eisley, Billy Curley, Malcolm
Huckaby, and Gerrod Abram, the four kids who went from a 1-15 Big
East record as freshmen to within two minutes of the Final Four
three years later. They are sitting in front of the bleachers and
the photo has the following inscription: ``We're Not Ones For
Words, So In A Nutshell Coach . . . Thanks For Everything. Howard,
Billy, Malcolm and Gerrod.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is a photo of O'Brien with his arm around a
disconsolate Eisley, who has lost his dribble, and, with it, the
last chance for BC to defeat Florida and advance to the 1994 Final
Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``My favorite photo,'' O'Brien says. ``We are actually standing
on the playing floor while the game is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien's official, unswerving policy with regard to the events
that led to his being here in Columbus is to let others do the
talking. What went down at his alma mater was too public and too
painful. He knows he came out looking like the bad guy, and what's
done is done. He chooses to, as they say, move on.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If anyone wonders whether or not Jim O'Brien can coach, consider
that, with the addition of just one 5-foot-9-inch guard, a team
that was 8-22 last year now stands at 15-5 and is a legitimate
candidate to become both Big 10 champion and a participant in the
NCAA tourney. Of course, that 5-9 guard is the indefatigtable James
``Scoonie'' Penn, one of 11 players who either left or declined to
come to BC when the administration detonated the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to provide leadership,'' says Penn. ``I'm not worried
about scoring.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be something of an oversimplification, but the fact is
that Ohio State's primary offensive weapon is the explosive Michael
Redd, a devastating scorer who last week reached the 1,000-point
plateau in the shortest time since Lucas did it in the early '60.
</P>
<P>
   Redd, a slasher of the first order, is a very tough player to
defend.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the foul line in,'' says O'Brien, ``he's as good as any
player in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim O'Brien and Ohio State. It is tough on the ear, isn't it? He
found out it was equally tough on the psyche of the high school and
AAU coaches of Ohio when he and his staff first began to make the
rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like, `We don't know these guys from a hole in the
wall,' '' O'Brien explains. ```Who are these guys? You're not one
of us.'''
</P>
<P>
   The flip side is that Obie &AMP; Co. were now wearing the scarlet
and gray.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot imagine the magnitude of the long arms of Ohio
State,'' O'Brien points out. ``That carries unbelievable clout in
the state of Ohio. You're from Ohio State, so they are interested
in what you have to say.''
</P>
<P>
   It also helped that O'Brien was in the company of trusted
friends and associates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The single most important thing for me was that all our guys
came with us,'' he explains. ``We were starting from scratch here,
but we all knew each other. I didn't have to worry about, `Can I
trust this guy? Can he do the job?' That was never a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   This may be the most intact staff in all of Division 1
basketball. Associate head coach Rick Boyages and assistants Paul
Biancardi and Dave Spiller have each been with O'Brien for at least
eight years. Then throw in Randy Shrout, who was at BC for 19 years
as athletic trainer and assistant athletic director and is now Ohio
State director of basketball operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I handle everything but basketball,'' says Shrout, who takes
care of scheduling, travel, and the budget (the basketball program
has its own). It sounds more like a management team than a coaching
staff, but that's life in the express lane of college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   One thing O'Brien will never forget is the summer of 1997. Here
he was, the new guy in town, eager to make a good impression. And
what was his first official act? He threw five players off the
team, three of them double-figure scorers. ``Even worse, most of
them were from Ohio,'' O'Brien points out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Academic problems, social problems, basketball problems,'' he
explains. ``There was a lot of turmoil. There were some talented
players involved, but it was all in the best interests of the
program. But you think that wasn't an issue, an outsider coming in
and throwing those Ohio kids off the team?''
</P>
<P>
   What O'Brien seeks are more players like Redd, who is not only
gifted but also happens to come from Columbus West High School.
Keeping the good Ohio kids home has been an issue at Ohio State.
O'Brien has tried to make nice with the very influential Ohio High
School Coaches Association, and he feels he's making inroads. One
of his three current commitments is Yugoslavian forward Slobodan
Ocokoljic, by way of Massillon's Washington High School.
</P>
<P>
   He laughs when he thinks of his career progression.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went from St. Bonaventure to BC, it was a no-brainer,''
he says. ``There were no contract issues. I was coming back to
coach at my school, and nothing else mattered. This time I had a
zillion questions. My first BC contract was a page and a half. This
contract is a couple of inches thick.''
</P>
<P>
   He remains fascinated with the impact Ohio State has on the
community of Columbus, and the importance of the program. He will
always be grateful to people who remained upbeat enough last year
throughout a 17-game losing streak to cheer the walk-ons when they
when they entered in garbage time.
</P>
<P>
   But he also knows that the only reason he is here is that Randy
Ayers couldn't get it done. He knows how fragile his guard-oriented
team is, and he can't help daydreaming about the help he should get
next year from 7-3 Juco student Aleksandar Radojevic. He coaches in
an unforgiving league, where every road game is a guarantee of a
packed house. The people won't be smiling through losing streaks in
a year or two. They'll be signing petitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a look at this place,'' he says. ``You know it's serious
business.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota game has come and gone, and now O'Brien has more
problems. His team ran all over the Gophers by the exact same
29-point margin (89-60). Quincy Lewis? Obie threw a
triangle-and-two at Lewis and guard Kevin Clark. Lewis had 23, but
it was all cosmetic. Ohio State led from wire to wire.
</P>
<P>
   The next game is at Michigan State Wednesday night. His kids may
be up in the ozone somewhere, but Jim O'Brien knows there's not
going to be any 29-point victory in East Lansing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to have to make something up,'' he says. ``I'm going
to have to come to the next practice with an attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   He's had back-to-back 29-point wins, and all he can think of is
what little fabrication he can spring on his team to snap it back
to reality. And you thought coaching was all about X's and O's.

SAMARANCH SHOWS HIS OLYMPIC METTLE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ ``And what do you think of Monsieur
Samaranch?,'' a taxi driver asked on the way to International
Olympic Committee headquarters Monday afternoon. ``Quelle salade,
n'est-ce pas?''
</P>
<P>
   The French have a word for the distasteful five-ringed tangle of
crudites that has evolved from the Salt Lake City payoff scandal.
The august IOC's honor has been blackened. Three members have
resigned, six more likely will be expelled and more may follow as
the investigation broadens to other cities and other years.
</P>
<P>
   And Juan Antonio Samaranch, the 78-year-old Spanish marquis who
has presided over the IOC for nearly two decades, has found himself
in the center of a global hurricane. Everyone outside the Olympic
``family,'' it seems, from Salt Lake committee officials to
newspapers, have been calling for his white-haired head, which they
charge has been buried in the sand for years while bribery and
graft swirled around him.
</P>
<P>
   Though Samaranch says he had been hearing whispers of corruption
for years, he said the IOC never had evidence to expel members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some names on the Salt Lake City list were always in the
rumors,'' he said Monday, sitting in his office at the lakeside
Chateau de Vidy here. ``But the first time in all the years that we
have proof is now.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday's front page, the Times of London called Samaranch
``monstrously self-aggrandizing,'' a ``pretend president'' who
practices ``passive corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Samaranch: How Long Can He Hang On?,'' the local weekly
L'Hebdo wondered recently amid the worst scandal in the IOC's 105
years.
</P>
<P>
   But Samaranch insisted again that he would hang on until his
term expires in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``To resign in this moment when the boat is in a storm, this is
not my style,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the family apparently wants Samaranch to stay at the
helm. The IOC's executive board gave him a unanimous vote of
confidence on Sunday, and Samaranch will ask the same from his 114
colleagues on the full committee when they meet here in special
session in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``My position is clear,'' he said. ``I am elected president by
the members of the IOC. I will ask the members if I have their
support or not. I do not depend on outsiders.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch is the only president that most of the Lords of the
Rings have ever known. He has nominated all but 23 of them and has
been a member longer than all but four. He has seen the Olympic
movement through two major boycotts, the breakup of the Eastern
bloc, and several doping scandals.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have a president who's brought you through the good
times and then get rid of him when the bad times come,'' said
executive board member Kevan Gosper of Australia. ``If ever we
needed a good president, an exeprienced president, it's now.''
</P>
<P>
   If Samaranch were to resign, the radical cleansing and reform
that members will vote on in March _ expelling six more members and
allowing a 15-member election committee to pick the site of the
2006 Winter Games _ might not happen, IOC officials warn.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you change presidents now,'' says marketing director
Michael Payne, ``we haven't got a chance of completing those
changes.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the IOC were a multinational corporation like Coca-Cola or
McDonald's, Samaranch might have stepped down already.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you can't take a corporate model and apply it to this
model,'' says Payne.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC is a nonprofit club whose members, from Algeria to
Zimbabwe, meet once a year. They are not elected, but in IOC-speak,
``co-opted.'' They serve without pay and they make their own rules.
When the executive board voted to expel six of them Sunday, it
wasn't because they were corrupt, Samaranch said. It was because
they had broken their sacred oath.
</P>
<P>
   And Samaranch, as president, is not so much a CEO as a global
ambassador whose mission is to preach the virtues of Olympism. He
has spent much of the past two decades jetting around the planet;
he hopes to visit all 200 member countries before he leaves office.
He consorts with kings and presidents. And wherever he goes,
Samaranch is treated like royalty.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1991 IOC session in England, where Nagano was named host
of the 1998 Winter Games, Samaranch reportedly stayed in a
$1,000-a-night penthouse suite with a fireplace, Jacuzzi, and baby
grand piano. Salt Lake City has set aside $60,000 for his lodgings
during the 2002 Games.
</P>
<P>
   But when questions of his lavish lifestyle come up, Samaranch
bristles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot understand about this lifestyle,'' he said. ``My
lifestyle is very simple. When I read in some newspapers that I
take a helicopter from Lausanne to Geneva (35 miles away), that's
crazy. It's much quicker to go by car.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch lives in a $200-a-day suite in the Lausanne Palace
Hotel. ``It is not a big suite, I assure you.'' He dresses in plain
gray or blue suits. ``I am a very normal man,'' he says.

OLYMPIC GLORY AT MUCH TOO HIGH A PRICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN VENNOCHI  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So now we know one way to become a world class city: shower
greedy members of the International Olympic Committee with cash and
other lavish gifts.
</P>
<P>
   It happened in Salt Lake City, in Sydney, Australia, and who
knows where else? The participants in these go-for-the-gold schemes
are trying to wriggle around the obvious and say the money and
gifts bestowed upon IOC members were ``inducements,'' not bribes.
But the truth is clear and beyond euphemism.
</P>
<P>
   These cities cheated to win, using money as dishonorably as some
Olympic athletes use performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   It is a huge scandal and embarrassment for the IOC, which is
promising to reform the bidding process. Yet so far, the reform
effort seems minimal. Six IOC delegates have been expelled, three
have resigned, and one has been scolded.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC has a long way to go before it can hope to restore its
tarnished reputation. In the meantime, this scandal should make
civic leaders across the country rethink the current definition of
``world class'' urban greatness. As we draw closer to the
millennium, the definition has less and less to do with schools,
housing, the arts and sciences _ and more and more to do with the
construction of grandiose monuments to sports, spoiled, overpaid
athletes, and corporate sponsorships.
</P>
<P>
   Think about what is happening today in Boston. Stoked by a
strong economy and prodded by powerful development forces, this
city is on the verge of changing its look and feel forever. It is
tempted regularly to accept the new turn-of-the-century definition
of greatness _ stadium packages and the like. Anyone who resists is
taunted for being shortsighted and parochial.
</P>
<P>
   Yet those most intimately involved in the modern greatness chase
already know a dark potential downside almost always exists.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, a group of local business people tried hard to
stir some high-level corporate interest in the Olympics. Their goal
was to woo a summer Olympic games to the Athens of America. When
they could not get corporate sponsorship, the effort died. The
lethal blow came from the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance
Company _ one of a dozen worldwide corporate sponsors of the
Olympic movement _ when executives there declined to jump on board
the Boston Olympic bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock chairman Stephen L. Brown offended local bigshots behind
Boston's nascent effort when he put his name to a newspaper opinion
piece headlined ``The Olympics will hurt Boston.'' Hancock, he
wrote then, knows ``enough about the Olympics to respect the
distinct advantages which accompany the Games. But those advantages
come at a very steep price and the reward will vary from one host
city to another.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, Hancock's message was even blunter. Hancock president
David D'Alessandro says he told Boston's Olympic advocates ``there
is the potential for corruption. Be prepared to entertain lavishly.
Be prepared for what we described as an endless food chain of
people arriving and wanting things. The problem is, you don't dare
say no.''
</P>
<P>
   These warnings came long before the still-unfolding Olympic
scandal. Even without knowledge of specific corruption, a major
sponsor like Hancock knew other grim truths about hosting the
games. For instance: The interlocking Olympic rings bring a host
city a short burst of glory and then something much less desirable
_ too much debt for too much of the wrong kind of infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The highest point people have is not actually hosting the
games, but winning them,'' says D'Alessandro. ``There is very
little evidence of any longterm economic value, and there appears
to be very little evidence of continuing civic pride after they're
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   As details of the current scandal pour out, Hancock is taking a
strong stand, calling for a broad and tough investigation of
bidding irregularities. Beyond that, D'Alessandro also believes the
Olympic Committee should pick a permanent host site and be done
with future bidding wars and their potential for corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should a single city overbuild itself, extend its
taxpayers beyond their means and have unbelievable political
battles for an unimproved economy, if not a deteriorating economy,
and facilities that will never be used again?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   That is an excellent question.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps we are just too tempted by the notion of a quick and
easy fix, a pain-free way to pump new life into cities. So we fight
for the glamour of an Olympic extravaganza, a glitzy new stadium or
a massive convention center. We are so dazzled by the promise of a
giant pay day, we choose to ignore the simple truth.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Thomas M. Menino spoke it in a line in his recent State of
the City address: ``Stadiums do not revive cities, '' he said.
``People do.''
</P>
<P>
   The same can be said of an Olympic contest. A fleeting glory is
associated with all elements of this competition. But, as the
people of Salt Lake City now know _ at what a price!

CRUNCH TIME FOR KERRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Time is now the enemy for Senator John Kerry, who is watching in
that typically indecisive way of his as his potential Democratic
rivals for the presidency translate their ambitions into action in
the millenial campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He is fretting, struggling, grappling, agonizing. He is
spreading calls to the farthest corners of the country while
searching the deepest crevices of his own soul. He needs an answer
he is unable to find, and he needs it soon.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs good and bad. The Democratic field has dwindled
to just a pair of contenders, Vice President Al Gore, the clear
front-runner, and former senator Bill Bradley, leaving a gaping
opportunity to increase his national stature, if not something
more. Bob Farmer, one of the party's most prodigious fund-raisers,
will sign on with Kerry, saying Monday, ``If he decides to run for
president, I'll be with him.''
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, as Kerry ponders himself into a state of
stalemate, Gore continues to shore up support for his titanic
political organization, such that California Democratic Party
President Art Torres said: ``Save your money. It's almost
insurmountable.''
</P>
<P>
   For Kerry, it is not easy being the junior senator from
Massachusetts, not now, not any time soon, not as long as Senator
Edward M. Kennedy casts his immense shadow across the political
landscape. But his obstacles to greatness come from within _ from
the less-than-subtle blemishes of his oft-discussed personality.
</P>
<P>
   He is widely derided as aloof and arrogant, but allies and even
proximate enemies regard this as a glib interpretation of a more
complex person. Kerry, by most measures, is actually a thoughtful
leader and a decent, even personable man, but plagued by a sense of
insecurity that colors too much of his public life. While Kennedy,
always confident, glides toward his goals, Kerry is attuned to
every small bump along the way.
</P>
<P>
   He is, at turns, engaging and enraging. He thinks nothing of
complaining about the relatively insignificant slights that other
politicians shrug off; or leaving a Senate aide dangling in a state
of professional limbo. His behavior can be not so much maddening,
but worse, annoying.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he banters easily over the most mundane aspects of life,
proclaims himself on a diet in the dining hall of Locke-Ober before
consuming a four-course lunch, and encourages advisers to prove him
wrong on a policy stand.
</P>
<P>
   It is his insecurity that, in part, has caused his flirtation
with a presidential bid. Fresh off his resounding and nationally
noticed defeat of William Weld in the 1996 Senate race, Kerry began
scanning the political horizon for signs of his enhanced status. He
floated his own name as a possible contender, began carving out
stands on such issues as education reform that would help define a
moderate candidacy, and began the arduous work of retiring his
campaign debt.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Kerry found long-elusive fulfillment in the form of
recognition. Newsweek carried an outsized photograph of him in a
story about Democratic candidates. Lions of the Washington press
corps trekked to Boston for an audience. The network news shows
called for his opinions on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   His longtime political strategists now paint a viable scenario
for success. Gore, a stiff campaigner with a penchant for withering
under pressure (``No controlling legal authority''), will stumble
during the campaign, and given his front-runner status, any loss of
footing will be seized upon and exaggerated by the national press.
Then, an issues-based alternative will emerge, much as Gary Hart
did against former vice president Walter Mondale in 1984. That
candidate could prevail, or at least have a claim on the vice
presidential nomination or front-runner status in 2004 or 2008.
</P>
<P>
   So Kerry wrestles with his destiny, longing for something more,
uncertain whether he can attain it. He tells people in private that
he wants to run in the very worst way, to prove himself capable, to
push his newfound issues of education and child care. But he
doesn't know if the race is over before it even begins, if his
candidacy will be regarded as the quixotic journey of another
dreamy-eyed Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in the final stage,'' he said Monday. ``The process has
been terrific, helpful, instructive.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, his most difficult question is not whether to run,
but why. If he can answer that, if it involves a purpose greater
than himself, the result might be the politician that so many of
his allies have been anticipating for so many years.

   MONTREAL _ Mahmoud El Farnawani, the Canadian middleman
identified by the International Olympic Committee Sunday as having
received $161,000 from Salt Lake City to ``influence'' North
Africans to support that city's bid for the 2002 Winter Games, also
worked over the years as a paid consultant for other cities seeking
to win the prestigious Games.
</P>
<P>
   According to acquaintances and news reports, the 65-year-old
Egyptian-born entrepreneur from Oakville, Ontario, was paid $60,000
by Sydney to help win the 2000 Summer Olympics and was hired by
Athens as a consultant in its successful bid for the 2004 games. He
has also worked for Toronto, Nagano (Japan), and Istanbul to lobby
North Africans on the Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Nagano was site of the 1998 Winter Games while Toronto, which
bid for the 1996 Summer Games, and Istanbul (2000 Summer Games)
failed in their efforts to be selected as Olympic cities.
</P>
<P>
   El Farnawani was named in this week's report by the executive
board of the IOC on the investigation that led to the recommended
expulsion of six committee members for accepting cash and other
gifts from organizers of the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City.
Four of the officials are Africans, and one is from the North
African nation of Sudan. In addition, two of three IOC members who
have resigned in the scandal are African, one from Libya, the other
from Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic officials say there is no evidence that El Farnawani did
anything wrong in his efforts to convince Olympic Committee members
from North Africa that the Utah city was the best place for the
Games. He was hired by the Salt Lake organizing committee ``on the
basis . . . he might be able to influence North African members,''
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing illegal or improper about that, said El
Farawani's lawyer, David M. Goodman of Toronto, saying the report
exonerates his longtime client.
</P>
<P>
   ``He worked as a lobbyist, as a middleman, as a protocol man,''
but not as a bagman, Goodman said. ``He has been on the periphery
of the Olympics for years and years.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, El Farnawani has worked on the edges of the Olympic
movement since the 1950s, first as a volleyball coach in his native
Egypt and later as a well-paid agent of influence for cities hoping
to snare the games.
</P>
<P>
   He emigrated to Canada in the early 1970s by way of Libya.
</P>
<P>
   ``My belief is I did nothing wrong,'' El Farnawani told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   As president of Trade &AMP; Sports Canada Inc., an Ontario firm that
specializes in sports souvenirs, El Farnawani won a merchandising
franchise for the 1988 Winter Games in Calgary, Alberta.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, El Farnawani has been able to sell his services
to Olympic organizing committees in North America, Asia, and
Australia ``because of his extensive friends and contacts in North
Africa,'' said Goodman. ``He knows a lot of people in that region.
He could be persuasive because he could say, `Hey, I'm a North
African, like you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Along with pitching for Salt Lake City and Sydney, El Farnawani
was able to advise Olympic Committee members about Islamic customs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe something as simple as telling them to be sure not to
serve pork to a Muslim, or that it would be a polite touch to make
sure there is a prayer rug in the hotel room,'' Goodman said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Toronto Star, he worked as an unpaid volunteer
for a Toronto group that tried unsucessfully to win the 1996
Olympics for that city, and more recently was briefly a paid
consultant for Toronto's effort to secure the 2008 Games.

PHOENIX AREA OFFERS A LOT MORE THAN GOLF 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN SHEPHERD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ A winter vacation in the Southwest, especially
Arizona, typically means golfing in shirtsleeves, lounging by the
pool, and soaking up the sun at a fancy, everything-in-one-place
resort.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't have to be that way. Why not break out of that
rut and get away from the artificiality of the golfer's
environment? With some planning and the spirit of new adventure and
discovery, you can stay at a dude ranch, visit a desert garden,
learn about Native American cultures and art, browse for antiques
in an historic town, go gallery hopping, or tour architect Frank
Lloyd Wright's Taliesin West. After a few days or a week, the
vacation will be unlike any you've shared with the duffer.
</P>
<P>
   These suggestions for activities are in the Phoenix area,
although most of them can be adapted to other parts of the state.
These are starter ideas; pick and choose what suits your time and
interests. Besides, you can always go back. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Calling all dudes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Western ranches have been welcoming guests or dudes (novices)
since the late 19th century when the railroad made it easy for
Easterners to travel great distances and get a taste of the Wild,
Wild West. Staying at a ranch is still a good way to experience
life on the range.
</P>
<P>
   When I scrolled through the Dude Ranchers' Association Web
site's descriptions of 10 guest ranches around Arizona, I made my
choice based on location, size, and style of operation _ I had no
desire to be part of a cattle drive, an incentive at some ranches.
I settled on Kay El Bar Ranch in Wickenburg because of its 73-year
history as a guest ranch and the maximum number of guests is 24 _ I
didn't want to hang out at a mega-ranch-resort. It also offered
stays under a week (four-night minimum in high season beginning
mid-February) and welcomed singles.
</P>
<P>
   The ranch was an easy drive from Phoenix, but as I turned off
Highway 93/89, I wondered what I would find at the end of the
two-mile dirt road. But once I arrived, owner-managers John and
Nancy Loftis quickly came out to greet me. It was obvious after a
few minutes that they do their darndest to make guests feel welcome
at their rustic, very comfortable ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the original
buildings such as the Main Lodge are made of thick adobe bricks
that were hand-built on site by five Indians. The setting _ on the
Hassayampa River with vistas of the Bradshaw Mountains (yes,
Arizona has mountains, lots of them) _ makes it seem as if
civilization were thousands of miles away, yet the town of
Wickenburg is only three miles away and Phoenix 60 miles.
</P>
<P>
   During a walking tour of the grounds, one of the owners explains
ranch and guest procedures. The home-cooked meals are served family
style, with guests and ranch hands eating together in the
light-filled dining room, a separate building that the Loftises
have turned into the history room with wonderful old photos and
artifacts from early ranch days. A social hour in the inviting
Western-style lodge room precedes the evening meal; in
mid-December, conversation around a crackling fire was a welcome
break after a day out in the wind and sun. The meals were
delicious; each was different. A lunchtime meal featured fajitas
made with sausages (meat or vegetarian) that John had smoked over a
mesquite fire. (He smokes or grills most of their meats.)
</P>
<P>
   Riding begins on the first morning at a 45-minute orientation
with head wrangler Norm, who wants each guest to learn how to
control the horse, gently, using the bit as the communicator, and
to know the rules of the ride. As a beginner, I found the
orientation invaluable, instilling confidence about handling the
horse. Then it's time to hit the trail. The maximum number on a
ride is six people, who are grouped together based on ability and
length of ride (from two hours to all day).
</P>
<P>
   The rides are through the desert landscape in the foothills of
the Bradshaw Mountains, even going through a high-walled wash they
jokingly call their Little Grand Canyon. Wranglers answer questions
about plants, animals (deer, jackrabbit, longhorn steers, and
occasionally javelina pigs are some of the critters that live out
here), and other curiosities. On a ride with Norm, he entertained
by reciting cowboy poems at two sites and demonstrated why it's
important to avoid jumping chollas _ if a branch of this cactus
jumps on you, only pliers will pull out the needles.
</P>
<P>
   As a first-time dude, I found it was easy to get into the rhythm
of the ranch. It turned out to be a wonderful travel idea, even
though at the end of my two-night, three-ride stay, my legs were
wobbly even after I got back to Phoenix. Would I do it again?
Absolutely. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Desert life &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you ever thought all cactuses are created equal, then a visit
to the Desert Botanical Garden in Papago Park in Phoenix will
change that notion. Some of the names say it best: organ pipe,
compass barrel, golden barrel, octopus, saguaro, prickly pear. Or
take the cholla (pronounced CHOY-a) family: teddy bear, jumping,
diamond, buckhorn, pencil, devil. Two unusual cactuses are
towering: boojum, a rare treelike member of the ocotillo family,
and cardon, a multi-armed cactus growing on top of a treelike base.
Names like Indian fig prickly pear and the wait-a-minute bush also
caught my attention.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a guessing game to figure out individual plants. The
garden's labels identify plants with Latin names _ that's how to
know that teddy bear and jumping chollas are different cactuses _
common names, and region of origin. Docents also are on hand to
answer questions and lead tours.
</P>
<P>
   The 145-acre garden has 45 acres of display plantings. The
garden was opened to the public in 1939 by the Arizona Cactus and
Native Flora Society to exhibit, conserve, and showcase arid plants
of the world. The founders wanted to preserve plants _ rare and
common _ knowing if they weren't saved, they would be lost forever.
Today, the founders would be even more concerned if they could
witness the LA-type urban sprawl that is devouring the Southwest's
desert lands.
</P>
<P>
   The garden's collection of 4,000 arid land flora _ cactus,
succulents, trees _ is a reminder that the desert is a diverse
ecological system supporting all types of plants, birds, reptiles,
and mammals that adapt to the harsh environment where temperatures
can plunge quickly from searing heat to freezing cold and the
average annual rainfall in Phoenix is 7.5 inches.
</P>
<P>
   A good time to visit is early in the day _ it's not as crowded,
birds are active and singing, the light accentuates the plants, and
on hot days, it's cooler. Four self-guided, themed trails _ Desert
Discovery Trail, Plants &AMP; People of the Sonoran Desert, Sonoran
Desert Nature, Center for Desert Living _ allow you to do one or
all at your own pace. A cafe on the Ullman Terrace is a peaceful
oasis for breakfast, light lunch, or snacks. There are drinking
fountains throughout the gardens, but carry your own water, a
requirement in a desert environment. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Native cultures &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A special place will become even more special beginning Feb. 28.
That's when the Heard Museum of Native Cultures and Art celebrates
the opening of an $18 million, 50,000-square-foot expansion that
adds three galleries, an auditorium, a cafe, and educational
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion is a welcome development at this private,
nonprofit museum that Dwight B. and Maie Bartlett Heard founded in
1929 to house their own collection of Native American art and
artifacts. Today, the museum continues to offer insight into the
complex and fascinating history and cultures of Native Americans.
No one would be likely to visit all the tribes in the United
States, if any (Arizona has 21 tribes within its borders), so the
museum is an efficient way to learn about many tribes in one place.
One can easily spend hours here, which is one reason the museum
included a cafe in the expansion.

 VILNIUS, Lithuania: ... of pride.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The oddest manifestation of Catholicism here _ at least from my
lapsed-Unitarian perspective _ is the ``Gates of Dawn,'' originally
part of the town's fortifications. In the 17th century, Carmelites
built a chapel in the wall over the gate, to house an image of the
Virgin that they believed had miraculous healing powers. The icon
of the Virgin is now surrounded by 15,000 offerings in silver, many
depicting body parts people wanted cured: If you had a hurt leg,
you got a silversmith to make a silver leg to give to the icon.
Pious elderly women still climb the steep stone staircase to the
chapel on their knees.
</P>
<P>
   Vilnius was once a center of Jewish culture, too, but Jewish
Vilnius was virtually obliterated by the Nazis. There were once
over 100 synagogues here; now there is one, the Choraul Synagogue,
built in 1904 and restored three years ago. Its ornate
peach-and-blue interior has an almost Moorish feel. But, sadly, it
also feels like a relic. The caretaker says that only 15-20 people
attend services here regularly, and that he, at age 75, is the
youngest of them.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the many things I loved about Vilnius is that I could
afford it. Much of Europe has become too expensive for Americans
who want to shop; Lithuania hasn't. On the street you can find an
array of well-made crafts, including baskets, amber jewelry,
handmade clothing, and bracelets and buttons made from woods with
intricate graining. For $5, you can buy quite a nice basket from
the woman who made it, who will be enthusiastic about selling her
wares without being so aggressive that you're uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the handsomely rebuilt Island Castle in Trakai,
Lithuania's former capital, a half-hour drive from Vilnius, is a
row of stalls selling dresses and sweaters crocheted from
Lithuanian flax. They're chic, they won't wrinkle, and they cost
next to nothing. I paid $20 for a dress with full-length vest. I've
actually worn the outfit back home, as opposed to the complete
wardrobes I've lugged back from places like Senegal and Indonesia,
clothes that turned out to look ludicrous outside their country of
origin.
</P>
<P>
   I'm always afraid that ``amber'' will turn out to be plastic, so
in Vilnius I bought mine at a legit-looking place in the center of
town, called the Amber Sculpture Museum. (It's the kind of museum
where the ``exhibits'' are all for sale.) There was something
irrationally comforting about the high-overhead premises, and the
shop has a far broader range of styles than the street vendors do.
In an attempt to educate their clientele, the shop's personnel
offer pamphlets with interesting translations from the Lithuanian.
One claimed that the most significant deposits of amber ``occur
only on the shoes of the Baltic Sea,'' which made me check the
owner's footwear.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My tour of the Baltic States, organized by the travel company
Abercrombie &AMP; Kent, included all three capitals _ Vilnius; Riga,
the capital of Latvia; and Tallinn, in Estonia. En route from
Vilnius to Riga was a stop at the famous Hill of Crosses, where for
centuries pilgrims have come to put up crosses that now number in
the hundreds of thousands _ crosses tiny and huge, in various
shapes, made of materials from birch twigs to steel, packed so
tightly together that columbine and ferns struggle to find space to
grow among them. The Soviets repeatedly bulldozed the crosses, only
to find the hill blooming with more of them soon after.
</P>
<P>
   In Riga, I admired both the Art Nouveau architecture _ much of
it designed by Mikhail Eisenstein, father of the filmmaker, Sergei
_ and the most beautiful suspension bridge I've ever seen. And I
was lucky enough to stumble on a choir rehearsal in the Dome
Cathedral, which has a famous organ with 6,718 pipes. The choir
would have sounded fine anywhere, but in this setting they were
celestial: I've never experienced finer acoustics than in this
cathedral that dates from the 13th century. Tallinn is intensely
competitive about organs, and my guide, while acknowledging that
the one in Riga is larger, claimed that the organ in Tallinn's
cathedral makes a sound that echoes two seconds longer.
</P>
<P>
   It was Vilnius, though, that made the biggest impression on me,
maybe partly because I stopped there first, but also because Egle
was such a great guide. (My guide in Tallinn had kept her
Soviet-era totalitarian lack of humor intact, along with a tendency
toward the literal. ``Now we are turning left'' was her idea of
fascinating information to pass along to tourists.)
</P>
<P>
   Its historic center may have been restored to movie-set
perfection, but Vilnius still bears scars left by Nazis and Soviets
alike. Egle pointed out the edge of a forest on the outskirts of
the city, where people once went to gather mushrooms and berries:
It's also where thousands of Jews and intellectuals were taken by
the Nazis to be shot and dumped into mass graves.
</P>
<P>
   It's Russia's unpredictability that Lithuanians fear now. ``We
live on a box of powder,'' Egle said, and it wasn't detergent she
was talking about. Pointing out some Stalinist sculpture that
remains in situ still, she said, ``We shouldn't get rid of all of
it. We can't erase 50 years of Soviet presence here.''
</P>
<P>
   But they've turned part of that presence into a tourist
attraction _ the KGB Museum, a converted turn-of-the-century
courthouse where thousands of Lithuanians endured interrogation
before being shipped to Siberia. A former inmate now gives tours of
this chamber of horrors that was used as a prison right up until
Lithuania gained independence in 1991. Upward of 20 prisoners
inhabited the same small cell, he said, where they slept standing
up, leaning against one another. Prisoners were allowed to wear
only underwear in the unheated isolation cells. Showers were
allowed once a month, the temperature of the water controlled by
guards who could make it scalding or freezing. One torture cell
could be flooded with cold water so prisoners couldn't lie down to
sleep. And so on.
</P>
<P>
   For all this, the guide says the KGB prison was nothing compared
to Siberia, where he spent 15 years in a climate where the
temperature bottomed out at 50 degrees below zero. This elderly
gentleman looked remarkably hale and hearty, given what he'd
endured. His secret? ``Siberia was like living in a refrigerator,''
he said. ``It preserved me.''

 PHOENIX: ... the expansion.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One gallery in particular can occupy most of your time. ``Native
Peoples of the Southwest'' opens with a continuous audiovisual
program in which members of Southwest tribes talk about their lives
and how they pass on traditions and wisdom to younger generations.
The displays focus on their lands _ covering the Sonoran Desert to
the Colorado Plateu _ grouped by individual tribes such as Zuni,
Apache, Navajo, Hopi, and Pima, detailing their history, where they
live and work. Exhibits of ancient pots, beadwork, weavings,
textiles, basketry, leather work, and silver work for each tribe
are reminders that these were functional objects, created for daily
life, and occasionally for trade. Yet these pieces are beautiful in
their simplicity, establishing clear links to what contemporary
Native American craftsmen and artists create now.
</P>
<P>
   The final room in ``Native Peoples of the Southwest'' is the
stunning Katsina Doll Gallery of some 500 carved figures that
represent the individual spirits, deities, and other ceremonial
figures for the Hopi pueblo. The katsinas (Hopi pronunciation for
the more commonly used word ``kachina'') were given to the museum
by the late Senator Barry Goldwater, who started collecting them as
a young man when he visited Hopi lands. The rest are from the Fred
Harvey Co., a trading company in the Southwest. The museum
collection is amazing in scope and details; each one is hand-carved
and painted, and identified by name and ceremonial role.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's impressive retail gallery and bookstore will double
its space in a freestanding building in the expansion. It's a
must-stop because it sells some of the finest contemporary Native
American jewelry, pottery, baskets, weavings, and contemporary
katsinas in all price ranges. The books by and about Native
Americans are far-ranging in topics.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to visit a prehistoric native site, there's one
within the city limits of Phoenix. An oasis of history between
skyscrapers and freeways, the Pueblo Grande Museum and Cultural
Park tells the story of the Hohokam peoples whose civilization
collapsed in the 15th century. Since 1929, the ruins have been
protected and overseen by the city archeologist. The site is
believed to be a major village and part of the canal system built
by Hohokam, an agricultural tribe that lived in the Salt River
Valley from AD 1 to 1450. On the south side of Phoenix, the visitor
center and museum houses artifacts from digs around the area; an
interpretative trail helps visitors understand current theories on
how the tribe lived. &QL; 
 &QL; 
A day in Glendale &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To most visitors, Glendale, a community adjacent to Phoenix, is
just another name on an Interstate 17 exit. But the Glendale Avenue
exit eastbound will lead to an old-fashioned Western town that is
preserving and promoting its early 20th-century atmosphere. Over
the last decade, downtown Glendale around City Hall, Public
Library, and Murphy Park has become a destination for people who
love antiques because almost every store is an antiques shop.
</P>
<P>
   I spent four hours going in and out of group shops and still
hadn't seen them all. On the non-antiques front, Cowpoke Western
Store, across from Murphy Park, was a good stop for cowboy duds and
funny Arizona T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Two blocks away from Murphy Park is Historic Catlin Court, an
original residential neighborhood with wonderful bungalow-style
houses, picket fences, climbing roses, and ornamental fruit trees.
Some of the homes have been converted into retail spaces with
boutiques specializing in folk art, angels, garden antiques, beads
and adornments, rubber stamps, and papers.
</P>
<P>
   On the eastern edge of downtown is the Cerreta Candy Co., a
retail store and factory all rolled into one. Founded in 1968, the
Glendale Avenue company specializes in chocolates, caramels,
creams, and nuts and sells primarily wholesale and corporate
orders. Visitors are welcome to watch the operations such as creams
moving on a conveyor belt through their chocolate bath. At preset
times each day, a guide with a microphone explains machinery and
candy decorating, and hands out a sample or two. Before or after
the tour, temptations reign at retail section. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Old Scottsdale &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Old Scottsdale is easily overlooked because new Scottsdale is
flashier and bigger, particularly the monster-sized mall known as
Fashion Square. But skip it and head to the city's downtown area
and Arts District, where you'll find more than 100 galleries
specializing in visual arts and contemporary crafts.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Feb. 14 marks the grand opening of the Scottsdale
Museum of Contemporary Art, the first museum in Arizona devoted
exclusively to contemporary art, architecture, and design. Under
the direction of Arizona architect Will Bruder, an old cinema
complex has been turned into what he calls a Museum without Walls.
The Gerald L. Cafesijian Pavilion has five galleries, an outdoor
sculpture garden, and an 80-foot-long dichroic glass installation
by New York artist James Fraser Carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   You can easily spend a day wandering in and out of the scores of
galleries along Fifth Avenue, Main Street (on both sides of
Scottsdale Road), Marshall Way, Second Street (where the new museum
and adjacent Scottsdale Center for the Arts are located). The scene
offers plenty of cafes and restaurants for lunch or dinner. The
Arts District sponsors ArtWalk, Thursdays 7-9 p.m., when galleries
stay open.
</P>
<P>
   You won't be able to see every gallery because after a while,
you begin to zone out with overload on Western images, but don't
judge a gallery by its window display; walk in and discover other
artists. I certainly didn't see every gallery, but I enjoyed Mind's
Eye, a contemporary crafts gallery; and Mind and Spirit, a dual
gallery overlooking a sculpture courtyard, with exquisite exhibits
in clay, jewelry, fiber, and wood. Leona King's Gallery has small
groupings of choice regional artists including Denise Meyers, an
amazing gourd artist. &QL;

Architecture &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The late Frank Lloyd Wright, probably best known as the
architect of the Guggenheim Museum in New York and the subject of a
Ken Burns PBS documentary last fall, came to the desert in the
1920s to collaborate on designing the Biltmore Hotel and Cottages
in Phoenix. But he returned often, and, in 1937, he, at age 70, and
his architecture students built Taliesin West as a winter home and
school in the McDowell Mountains in Scottsdale, northeast of
Phoenix. Built in _ not on _ is an important distinction because
Wright did not believe in dominating a landscape; he wanted to
become part of it, to be a grace note.
</P>
<P>
   Taliesin West, a National Historic Landmark and home of the
Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation, still operates as a school with 70
architecture fellows there from September to June. It is open to
the public for tours; taking one is a good introduction to his
philosophy and how he built this most unusual site, which he
described as ``a look over the rim of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright's first Phoenix building still stands at 24th and
Missouri, just off Camelback Road. The Biltmore Hotel, known as the
``Jewel of the Desert,'' opened in 1929. To get a sense of what it
was like then, the hotel has hung historic photographs of the
construction, including those of celebrities hanging out at the
pool; newspaper articles tout its construction and opening.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel reflects Wright's aptitude for simplicity and use of
natural materials: sandstone exteriors, sun-shielding verandas to
catch cooling breezes, glass blocks to capture light, and wood and
earth colors for the interior. The sandstone ``Biltmore Block'' was
designed by Emry Kopta, and Wright cleverly adapted its design in
many ways inside and out. The restaurants and bars offer a good way
to enjoy the public spaces. There's also a lavish Sunday brunch
($37.95 a person) in the luxurious main dining room. An artificial
environment is nearby, however, in the grassy center courtyard and
in the golf courses and private homes around the complex. Without
this private enclave and an influx of money to restore the hotel in
the late '80s, the Biltmore probably would have gone the way of
Wright's famous Imperial Hotel in Toyko that was demolished in the
name of progress.
</P>
<P>
   In nearby Tempe, Arizona State University's Grady Gramage
Auditorium was designed by Wright, but it wasn't built until after
his death, which was April 9, 1959.
</P>
<P>
   As for contemporary architecture, Phoenix has a great deal, but
the three-year-old Burton Barr Central Library is a striking
presence on busy Central Avenue. Arizona architect William Bruder's
design is a marvel of glass, steel, and copper. Like Wright, he
considers function, history, and location in his designs. Thus,
steel louvers on the south side automatically adjust to sunlight to
protect the interior. The reading room is spacious, to say the
least: 300 feet long by 170 feet wide, 30 feet high.
</P>
<P>
   It could be the perfect place to settle in and read even more
about this fascinating desert state.

INTO THE AMERICAN WOODS 
Negotiators on the Pennsylvania Frontier 
By James H. Merrell 
Norton, 463 pp., illustrated, $27.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In February 1744, a Pennsylvania fur trader named Jack Armstrong
and two companions were ambushed and killed by Mushemeelin, a
Delaware Indian whose horse Armstrong had seized in payment for a
long overdue debt. It was the kind of encounter that at other times
and places had triggered escalating acts of retaliation. In New
England, for example, such incidents had set off the Pequot War in
1637 and King Philip's War in 1676. But Pennsylvania was enjoying
``The Long Peace'' that was to last some 70 years, from the
colony's founding in 1681 to the eve of the French and Indian War.
</P>
<P>
   William Penn is historically _ and rightly _ given credit for
creating the conditions which allowed for so long a period of peace
on the Allegheny frontier. But as historian James H. Merrell shows
in this engaging account, it was a peace maintained and nourished
by a fascinating crew of Colonial and native ``go-betweens,''
skilled and knowledgeable negotiators who journeyed back and forth
between the wilderness and the settlements defusing incidents such
as the killing of Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   Such go-betweens were not unknown in the other colonies _ among
them must be counted Concord lawyer John Hoar, who negotiated the
ransoming of Mary Rowlandson after she was taken captive in the
raid on Lancaster during King Philip's War. But the difference in
Pennsylvania was that the position of negotiator had been
institutionalized.
</P>
<P>
   As Merrell reconstructs the Armstrong incident, after the
killings became known, two veteran negotiators _ Shickellamy, an
Oneida Indian, and Conrad Weiser, a Pennsylvania farmer _ were
pressed into service. ``In coping with this crisis,'' Merrell
writes, Shickellamy ``had to make inquiries and sift rumors, send
and receive messages, sit with Delaware and colonial councils, and
explain things to Iroquois ambassadors and provincial officials.''
Mushemeelin was arrested and brought to Philadelphia _ by his own
Delawares _ and eventually executed.
</P>
<P>
   Merrell, a professor of history at Northwestern University and
author of the Bancroft Prize-winning ``The Indians' New World,''
would have made a valuable contribution to Colonial history had he
gone no further than recounting so much of the Armstrong incident
as could be found in the provincial records. But he has gone far
beyond that, to uncover and reveal the lives and skills of the
negotiators _ ``an elusive lot,'' he writes, ``as obscure as they
were diverse'' _ and thus greatly enlarge our understanding of life
on the Colonial frontier.
</P>
<P>
   There was a consensus, Merrell writes, on what made a good
go-between _ ``a true good man . . . (who) spoke their words and
our words, and not his own . . . (someone) hearty and sincere''
even if, as most did, he drank too much.
</P>
<P>
   An Indian negotiator was definitely not to go native on arriving
in Philadelphia, even if he had donned a hat and riding boots to
get there, but the Colonial negotiator was expected to do so when
arriving in an Indian village.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Merrell writes, the Indian go-betweens invariably
held the upper hand in negotiations, for even if they understood
English, they insisted on having them carried out in their language
and ``their diplomatic customs held sway.'' Even Shickellamy could
be ``curt'' with Weiser when ``he was slow to pick up the finer
points of Indian protocol.''
</P>
<P>
   Much as in today's shuttle diplomacy, Colonial negotiators spent
much of their time on the road. Weiser reported once responding to
an Indian welcome by saying that ``it was enough to kill a man to
come such a long and bad road over hills, rocks, old trees, and
rivers, and to fight through a cloud of vermin and all kinds of
poisoned worms and creeping things, besides being loaded with a
disagreeable message'' _ upon hearing which, he added, ``they
laughed.''
</P>
<P>
   The fortunes of geography had provided space for peace to
flourish on the Allegheny frontier _ something that was notably
lacking in New England. But as military pressure from French Canada
increased _ the ambush and defeat of Braddock's army at the forks
of the Susquehanna occurred in July 1754 _ there were a series of
Indian attacks on Pennsylvania's frontier settlements.
</P>
<P>
   The Colonists, writes Merrell, ``lost faith in the culture of
diplomacy,'' which they had been willing enough to accept when it
``promoted trade, kept peace (and) bought land.'' But now, Indian
raids were taking place even as peace talks were under way. And
that an Indian war party ``spoke German to their German victims''
at one frontier massacre suggests to Merrell that the killings were
``at once a legacy of negotiators and a repudiation of that
legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   That legacy would be repudiated again and again over the next
century and a half, but it is important to know what was possible _
and what might have been.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Or maybe it's a function of the fact that rabbis and Jewish
educators _ deeply concerned about keeping Jewish families
religious in an assimilated world _ are becoming more vocal about
how to celebrate such events. Many, for example, are holding
workshops for bar and bat Mitzvah parents, suggesting ways to bring
more meaning and tradition into the synagogue ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   And they are not hesitating to talk about the parties.
</P>
<P>
   Says Rabbi Edgar Weinsberg of Temple Beth El in Swampscott,
Mass.: ``I feel very free in asking people to reconsider how much
they are going to lavish on this. I'll tell you that on one
occasion, about 10 years ago, we had here what is affectionately
known as a New York-style bar mitzvah. Everyone gathered in the
social hall, with wall-to-wall mirrors of reflective paper, with
strobe lights and an imported New York band. And then suddenly, the
curtains parted and a dancer leaped off the stage with a cape that
said, ``Captain Bar Mitzvah.''
</P>
<P>
   The downsizing trend is being noted even by party planners such
as Jane Haas of Hopple Popple in Newton, Mass., who has been
organizing custom bar and bat mitzvah celebrations for 21 years.
``I'm noticing that people are now taking a lot of things into
account, one of them being how to prioritize,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Of course not everyone is scaling down. And scaling down can
also be a matter of degree. As Bob Isaacs put it, ``going from
$60,000 to $40,000 is a step down. And so is going from $20,000 to
$5,000.'' And clearly party facilitators are in no danger of going
out of business. Business, in fact, has never been better for
Siagel Productions of Newton, the largest company in New England
offering bar and bat mitzvah disc jockey entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year is stronger than the last, there is no doubt about
it,'' says Cindy Siagel, who runs the business with her husband
Steven. Likewise, for Hopple Popple, business is ``the best it's
ever been,'' Haas says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What's the big deal about bar mitzvahs, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   In his popular book ``Putting God on the Guest List: How to
Reclaim the Spiritual Meaning of Your Child's Bar or Bat Mitzvah,''
(Jewish Lights Publishing, 1996), Long Island, N.Y. Rabbi Jeffrey
K. Salkin writes the rituals have been American Judaism's spiritual
mirror, reflecting changing trends in the manner of observance.
</P>
<P>
   But they are also its sociological mirror. In the 1960s and
1970s, being able to pay for a big splash was, for many
recently-emigrated, socially-insecure Jewish families, ``a way of
demonstrating they'd made it,'' says Jonathan Sarna, professor of
American Jewish History at Brandeis University.
</P>
<P>
   The splashes started to get even splashier with the financial
good times of the 1980s. And in the child-centered 1990s, with
two-working-parent families, parties escalated to the point of what
may have been the ultimate over-the-top party, held recently in
Pittsburgh. Rumored to cost half a million dollars, it had a
``Titanic'' theme complete with phosphorescent artificial icebergs
and a huge photo of the bat mitzvah girl's face superimposed over
Kate Winslet's body.
</P>
<P>
   But the countering trend is gaining on several fronts:
</P>
<P>
   _ Growing numbers of families are having their ceremonies in
Israel. ``Every year the number increases,'' according to Ilene
Wallerstein of the Illinois-based Israel Discovery Tours, one of
several companies booking such trips. ``People are looking for a
meaningful family experience, rather than a party that is over in a
few hours.'' Robin Gross and her family, of Lakeville, Mass., chose
that option for her daughter. The ceremony took place atop the
historic mountain fortress Masada, followed by a reception in a Tel
Aviv hotel for about 60 family members and friends, many of whom
lived in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   _ A push by Jewish educators to encourage families to perform
(itals)mitzvot(unitals) during the Bar/Bat Mitzvah year. At Temple
Emanuel in Newton, for example, family educator Maxine Zarchan
holds seminars for families on ``how to make a difference in the
world'' and links children with volunteer opportunities that match
their skills and interests. Many parents are choosing to donate a
percentage of what a bar mitzvah costs to the Los Angeles-based
national organization Mazon: A Jewish Response to Hunger, which
makes grants to anti-hunger agencies, mostly in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   _ Many parents who do have festive celebrations are making
charity part of the theme. For example, they are doing away with
strictly decorative centerpieces and making centerpieces with
social value _ baskets filled with toys or books or art supplies
that they will then distribute to children at a hospital, or a
homeless shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get them on a very consistent basis,'' says Suzanne Graca,
child life specialist at Boston's Children's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   As for Robin Rouse, she is busy planning her daughter Sara's bat
mitzvah, scheduled for August. Sara has decided to make her own
table centerpieces using teddy bears her mother purchased at
after-Christmas sales, and donating them afterward an agency that
works with children. Each bear will be donated in the name of a
guest she wants to honor, each of whom will be presented with a
miniature bear that she's making from clay.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Sara's party will be themeless doesn't bother her
in the least. Nor, looking back, does her older brother Ryan have
any regrets about the simplicity of his bar mitzvah. ``I've been to
lots of bar mitzvahs; some of them were pretty decadent,'' he says.
``But I don't feel like I missed out on anything important.''

DEADLINE LOOMS ON N.H. SCHOOL FUNDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALLENSTOWN, N.H. _ There are no foreign language classes for the
children of this former mill town. There is no band, no home
economics, no shop class.
</P>
<P>
   Wedged between Manchester and Concord, Allenstown may have more
trailer parks than any other spot in the state. And yet, its
residents pay one of the the highest property tax rates in New
Hampshire, trying to scrabble together enough money from their
low-value mobile homes to cover the school bills.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, the people of Allenstown, along with residents of
Claremont, Franklin, Lisbon, and Pittsfield, went to court to
demand relief.
</P>
<P>
   Their time, it appears, has finally come. After years of legal
and political wrangling, the state Supreme Court has issued an
ultimatum: The Legislature has little more than two months to raise
new funds to pay for schools, or the schools will close at the end
of the academic year.
</P>
<P>
   For a state whose identity is built in part on the absence of a
broad-based state tax, the choice could not be more difficult. It
can break with two centuries of tradition and institute an income
tax or try to raise the money, an estimated $600 million to $1.4
billion annually, other way. How best to move past this crisis, and
what the solution will mean for the future, have become the state's
all-consuming questions.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an April 1 court deadline looms. Public school
teachers have been warned to expect layoffs if no resolution is
reached.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire is not alone. Massachusetts, Vermont, and
Connecticut will all, to varying degrees, struggle with how to fund
schools in a way that is fair, constitutional, and that provides an
adequate education to students:
</P>
<P>
   --In Massachusetts, schoolchildren and their parents in a
21-year-old lawsuit against the Commonwealth are debating a return
to court. They are discouraged that the Legislature's Education
Reform Act is not providing enough money or resources and not
meeting minimal standards under the constitution.
</P>
<P>
   --In Vermont, last year's Act 60, which forces wealthier towns
to share property tax revenue with poorer communities, has sparked
an uproar. The legislation may be challenged in court by unhappy
taxpayers, and some towns have refused to turn over tax
collections.
</P>
<P>
   --In Connecticut, a new lawsuit contends that the state has not
done enough to meet its obligations in education. Based on the
settlement of a landmark case two decades ago, the state already
pumps $1.3 billion a year into its 166 school districts.
</P>
<P>
   How to fairly fund public schools also has presented a challenge
for other states across the country, whenever money for education
is raised locally through property taxes. The result: Children in
wealthy communities generally receive better resources than
children in faded mill towns.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six states have been taken to court in the past decade
over their education-funding systems. So far, the courts have
declared 13 of those states to have unconstitutional funding
mechanisms, according to the Consortium for Policy Research in
Education at the University of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   In Allenstown, Michael Viar was in kindergarten when he became a
plaintiff in the lawsuit that now threatens political careers.
Today, Michael is almost 15, taller than his attorney, and a
freshman in high school. The state system of funding education is
just as unconstitutional as it was 10 years ago. The schools are
still crumbling. The Legislature is still looking for a way to
avoid the issue. And most politicians still oppose taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pay so much money and we look at what other school
districts have and we look at what we don't have, and it's very
frustrating,'' said Ann Viar, Michael's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Dunlop, principal of the district's two schools, also is
frustrated. At the Armand R. Dupont School, 280 fifth- through
eighth-graders are crammed into every available inch of space. The
gymnasium has a new floor, thanks to $13,000 from bake sales. And
there are a few computers because of an ambitious, grant-writing
teacher.
</P>
<P>
   The computers often sit idle. Dunlop said he can't afford to pay
anyone with technical expertise to keep them going.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the least resources go to the school districts with
the greatest need,'' Dunlop said. ``Yes, I'm angry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The state Supreme Court has been pushing Governor Jeanne Shaheen
and the Legislature hard, refusing to extend the deadline. The
lawmakers must decide what constitutes an adequate education, and
how to pay for it. A commission appointed by the Legislature has
estimated that an adequate education would cost about $3,300 per
child, or about $630 million. Mississippi, by contrast, spends
$3,500 per child.
</P>
<P>
   How to pay for it all is even thornier. Most New Hampshire
politicians are elected only if they pledge not to institute a
broad-based tax, such as an income tax. Those who waver can find
themselves without a political future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do fault our governor for not having the courage to address
the problems squarely and avoid the limitations of the pledge,''
said Andru Volinsky, the lawyer representing the parents, children,
and school districts suing the state.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Shaheen proposed a solution, only to watch
Republicans tear it apart. The Democratic governor offers no
proposals of her own, other than to suggest putting the two best
ideas before the voters and letting them choose. ``I believe in
democracy,'' she said. ``The voters are very smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Clifton C. Below, the first Democrat elected to his
Lebanon Senate district, supports an income tax. ``The current
property system is unconstitutional and unenforceable as of April
1,'' he said. ``We have to do something.''

LITTLE-KNOWN FIRM HOPES SUPER BOWL WILL BRING IT FAME

<TEXT>
<P>
   HUDSON, N.H. _ Pro Player, Inc., the sports clothing company, is
stuck at the rear of a nondescript industrial park here, off the
road to Nashua.
</P>
<P>
   But, on Sunday, in a broadcast that about one-out-of-two
Americans will watch, the name Pro Player will be featured
prominently, as Fox Broadcasting televises the Super Bowl from Pro
Player Stadium in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   If the past is any guide, Pat Summerall, the venerable
play-by-play announcer, and his colleague, John Madden, are likely
to say the words ``Pro Player Stadium'' at least a few times to an
audience that advertising executives project at about 130 million
viewers. In fact, Fox and its broadcast team have already come
through big for Pro Player, featuring the company's name
prominently last Sunday when Madden announced his annual
``All-Madden Team.''
</P>
<P>
   A mere mention may not be quite the same marketing tool as a
30-second commercial. But while advertising executives say
companies are shelling out $1.6 million for 30-second spots during
the Super Bowl, Pro Player's notices during the broadcast come
entirely from its naming rights deal.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Pro Player, Inc. _ formed from the remnants of
three small, largely unknown firms in 1994 _ say that sort of name
recognition is priceless. Marketing experts say that the 10-year,
$20 million agreement with the stadium owner, H. Wayne Huizenga,
which was struck almost by coincidence in 1995, has proven to be
among the most valuable naming-rights deals in American sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of think of ourselves, this little New England company
up here in New Hampshire, as that Little Mouse That Roared,'' said
Doug Kelly, president and chief operating officer of Pro Player,
Inc. ``And the stadium deal has been a big part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the fact that a company that is not well known was
looking for some recognition, and the fact that there has already
been a World Series there, and now you have the Super Bowl coming
up with all of that marketing power, word around the business is
that it was one of the best stadium-naming deals,'' said Greg Abel,
of Advantage International, the Virginia firm which is a world
power in sports marketing and management.
</P>
<P>
   Pro Player, Inc., a small subsidiary of the apparel giant Fruit
of the Loom, has evolved in five years from a screenprinted T-shirt
and fiber-fill jacket company to the second-largest producer of
licensed sportswear in the country, with sales of about $218
million, according to Sporting Goods Business and other analysts.
It trails only the industry kingpin, Starter, Corp., of New Haven,
Conn. with $300 million in annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   In a business battered by a changing sense of fashion, Pro
Player has managed single-digit growth in sales in recent years
while many of its competitors struggle to maintain pace, according
to industry analysts and company officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people in the licensing business have kind of been
crying the blues,'' Kelly said during an interview as he sat in his
office amid an exurban design and manufacturing complex that feels
worlds away from the mega-media spotlight of the NFL's showcase
game. ``We're excited here about what we think are some great
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   In the space of 10 months beginning in late 1993, Fruit of the
Loom, acquired two small T-shirt screen printing companies, Salem
Sportswear and Artex, and the licensed outerwear company Pro
Player. It also hired Kelly away from Easton Corp., a California
manufacturer of aluminum bats and hockey sticks, where he was
president and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to develop a business plan to present to Fruit of the
Loom and their board of directors basically in a two-week time
frame,'' said the 45-year-old Kelly. ``I basically came up with a
plan that said we should put the majority of our dollars behind the
Pro Player brand, consolidating the operations in all of the
different labels they had in Salem, Artex and the old Pro Player.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advertising and the marketing dollars just don't spread,''
he said. ``We weren't going to get anywhere near the exposure we
were going to need to develop any one of the brands.''
</P>
<P>
   After Kelly's plan was in place, he and a group of Pro Player
vice presidents devised a strategy to grow the new company. Two
early thoughts were: striking a marketing deal with Jimmy Johnson,
a rising star among coaching ranks in the NFL; and another deal
with one of the more independent-minded owners in the league. With
Pro Player doing about 40 percent of its annual sales with NFL
products, the strategies appeared to make sense.
</P>
<P>
   Miami made sense, too, Kelly said, because if you cannot tap
into Manhattan or Los Angeles's influence on fashion _ in a world
looking away from the traditional sports look _ identifying with
South Beach is almost as good.
</P>
<P>
   Leveraging some of the contacts of an 800-pound gorilla, Fruit
of the Loom, Kelly soon found himself talking with Huizenga's
organization about a sponsorship deal, or maybe a deal with
Johnson, or with one of the coaches of Huizenga's other
Florida-based teams, the Marlins of Major League Baseball or the
Panthers of the National Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the dialogue went on,'' Kelly recalled, ``the title
situation came up. American Airlines had approached them about
renaming Joe Robbie Stadium, and one of Huizenga's guys asked me if
Fruit of the Loom would be interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them no,'' Kelly chuckled, face still flushed at the
unexpected good fortune. ``I told them that we would be interested,
as Pro Player.''
</P>
<P>
   Pro Player's deal with Huizenga is at the high end of the range
of naming-rights deals struck in the mid-1990s according to
marketing sources who track the accords.
</P>
<P>
   ``These naming-rights deals can be tricky,'' said Dennis P.
Wilson, a sport economist at the University of Massachusetts,
Amherst. ``It's called the Winner's Curse. Just because you win the
auction doesn't mean you won _ you might have overpaid.''
</P>
<P>
   But those who have evaluated the deal point out that Pro Player
Stadium offers the exposure of both Major League Baseball and the
NFL, as well as a top flight college bowl game _ the Federal
Express Orange Bowl _ every other year.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins played in a World Series in 1997. The Super Bowl is
there this year. In 2002, the National Championship Game in college
football will be played at Pro Player Stadium. Even considering
that the Marlins luck has changed dramatically, with Huizenga
selling off key players and then the team to a new owner, John
Henry, observers say Pro Player is well ahead of the curve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you have somebody like Pro Player, a company that
almost no one could recognize . . . it obviously makes sense to use
some of the marketing budget to buy name recognition,'' said Rick
Burton, of the Warsaw Sports Marketing Center at the University of
Oregon in Eugene. ``They're getting some exposure every time
somebody says, `Live from Pro Player Stadium.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The $2 million annual fee represents about 17 percent of Kelly's
annual advertising budget. He says he spends much of his time
leveraging the stadium exposure _ using the stadium and the Super
Bowl as a backdrop for a current series of ads in Sports
Illustrated and ESPN The Magazine, inviting major accounts down to
the stadium for games and using the Dolphins' cheerleaders to model
a new season's line of clothes at a fashion show in the Dolphin's
locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to use a lot of the rest of the advertising
budget to tell people that we're not just a stadium _ we're an
apparel company,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   The naming-rights deal has paid measureable dividends, he said.
Shortly after the name first appeared on the stadium in Miami,
company research showed that name awareness increased 7 percent, he
said. After the World Series, it was up by 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have the Super Bowl,'' Kelly said, grinning a victor's
grin. ``We are hoping that after it the improvement of our brand
awareness is going to be up by something closer to the mid 30s or
40s.''

TOBOGGANING JUST ONE ADVENTURE AT BERKSHIRES RESORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA MATCHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LENOX, Mass. _ I was wedged in tightly behind my new best
friend, Molly O'Brien , in a metal crate they call a toboggan at
the Eastover Resort and Conference Center here in the Berkshires.
</P>
<P>
   I'd known Molly for all of 90 seconds. She is 32, lives in
Ipswich, and just happened to be the person waiting ahead of me in
the line for the toboggan run. But that didn't stop me from
pleading with her to let me squish behind her and her older brother
Barry, so I wouldn't be alone as I plunged to what seemed probable
extinction on what the Eastover folks say is New England's longest
and fastest toboggan run.
</P>
<P>
   It's 1,500 feet long and all ice, and you travel the run, they
say, at 52 m.p.h. It's constructed of 300 300-three-hundred-pound
blocks of ice, laid end to end inside a narrow chute, which makes
your ride a lot like the one your groceries get at certain
supermarkets after they're bagged and pushed along metal rollers
towards your car. Except my ride was downhill all the way.
</P>
<P>
   In we scrunched, we intimate strangers, digging our fingers into
each other's Gore-Tex. ``You'll go like a hammer from hell,'' the
toboggan-run employee assured us before taking a step back and
letting us fly.
</P>
<P>
   We took off _ in much the manner he promised _ on what had to be
the most scary, bumpy, and yes, exhilarating toboggan ride I'd ever
experienced. ``It was terrifying,'' concluded Barry O'Brien once
he'd shakily extricated himself from the toboggan.
</P>
<P>
   But I'd survived it. After all, conquering fear was what this
three-day visit to Eastover was supposed to be all about.
</P>
<P>
   The Eastover Resort, to be sure, hardly seems like a scary
place. It's a pristine and manicured year-round vacation spot on
almost 1,000 acres, with indoor and outdoor pools, cross-country
ski trails, hiking, tennis, horseback riding, and numerous other
activities. But several weeks and weekends a year, the resort
sponsors so-called Family Weeks with special family rates and
activities. (At other times of the year, Eastover sponsors singles
weekends and couples weekends.)
</P>
<P>
   For many families, however, the big draw is downhill skiing,
since Eastover has its own beginner's slope, ski rentals, and
instruction. Indeed, the slope _ with its tame 84-foot vertical
drop _ is kind of a sheltered workshop for novice skiers.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that one person's bunny slope is another
person's Everest, and that person, alas, is me. Although I've
always been envious of those sturdy alpine types who cavalierly
dangle lift tickets from their zipper pulls, the truth is I've
stayed on level ground all my life. The older I get, and the more
friends and colleagues I see hobbling around with ski-induced
injuries, the more terrifying I find the prospect of taking to the
slopes.
</P>
<P>
   But with our son and daughter now 13 and 9, it seemed only fair
that we introduce them to the sport that their friends were already
mastering _ and at the same time show them there's a little life
left in the old folks yet. Eastover was a good place to begin,
since its ski package deals include meals, lodging, entertainment,
and social programs.
</P>
<P>
   So off we went the weekend after Christmas, with a minivan
stuffed with boots, gloves, hats, and sweaters; with another family
in our neighborhood; and, in my case, with a lot of dread and
anxiety. I confess that my hopes of being spared at the last minute
were raised when we arrived at the Berkshires and found: no snow.
But no, the folks at Eastover graciously offered us transportation
to the nearby Bousquet ski area in Pittsfield, which has snowmaking
equipment. Eastover even threw in a box lunch for us.
</P>
<P>
   So there we all were, on skis, on a sparkling crisp December
day. The kids took to it immediately; our son was off the bunny
slope and whizzing down the intermediate slope called Drifter in no
time. My own start was less auspicious. First, I mangled my
long-coveted lift ticket when I tried to attach it to my zipper.
Then I stumbled and fell on the rope tow, holding up a long line of
impatient bunnies. And then _ according to my son, who thereafter
called me ``Psycho Skier'' _ I flew down the bunny slope at a
ridiculously fast speed (I didn't know how to stop), dodging
children and snowboarders and screaming ``I'm out of
controllllllll'' at the top of my lungs.
</P>
<P>
   I don't remember any of this _ nor do I remember much about how,
when I foolishly decided to promote myself to ``Drifter,'' I caused
the chairlift operator to have to stop the lift twice. Once was
when I couldn't figure out how to get on it, and the other was when
I couldn't figure out how to get off.
</P>
<P>
   But did it really matter? No. Even Psycho Skier enjoyed the day.
And then it was back to Eastover to soak my weary bones in a hot
tub.
</P>
<P>
   The resort was built in 1910 by Harris Fahnstock, a stockbroker
from New York, who designed it as his summer home. It included a
brick Georgian mansion that is now used, among other functions, as
a dining hall and offices, and a stable that is now a recreation
hall called the Tally-Ho. Fahnstock sold Eastover in 1941, and in
1946 it was purchased by an Italian emigrant named George Bisacca,
who lived in Danbury, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Bisacca, the owner of a successful tire business, was the kind
of eccentric thinker who is sometimes discreetly referred to as a
``character.'' As a one-time roustabout for the Ringling Brothers
Circus, Bisacca, who died in 1983, developed a certain sense of
showmanship, according to Bob McNinch, Bisacca's son-in-law and one
of several members of the family who now operate the resort.
</P>
<P>
   Bisacca's sense of showmanship and quirkiness is still evident
at Eastover. It's in the revolving stage he ordered up for the
Tally-Ho, inspired by one he'd seen in Las Vegas. You can see it in
the resort's pet buffalo, grazing quietly on the property. (There
are 16 of them now, the descendants of the original two he
purchased in Oklahoma in 1961, just because he had a hankering for
them.) You can see it in a subtle detail in the resort's indoor
swimming pool _ two portholes installed inside the pool wall, so
that you can have an audience when you swim underwater, just like a
sea turtle at an aquarium.
</P>
<P>
   You can see it most dramatically in one of Eastover's hidden
treasures _ the American Heritage Room, an underground museum that
houses one of the largest privately held Civil War collections in
the United States. The Civil War was another of Bisacca's passions,
and he collected a vast number of artifacts, including an authentic
12-pound Dahlgren cannon and an 1861 Gatling gun.
</P>
<P>
   The Civil War theme also carries over into the rest of the
resort, says Bob McNinch's son Rob, who is general manager of
Eastover. Thus, the guest cottages have names like ``Carolinian,''
``Georgian,'' and ``Virginian.'' ``It provides a motif is what it
does,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   If the theme does seem rather un-Berkshire-like out in the
rarefied world of Tanglewood, well, so what? The resort gave us a
much-appreciated break from the daily routine of family life.
Although with the unexpected additional cost of Bousquet the price
of a visit seemed steep, we definitely enjoyed having meals without
worrying about settling the bill, having someone else vacuum up our
children's Cocoa Puffs, and having our activities planned for us.
(They include swim races, movies, dancing, and water aerobics;
there is a kids' camp for younger children and a pool table for
older ones, although the hours were restricted. It seemed that
there were more activities for younger kids than older ones; our
teenager reported he was ``bored'' a couple of times.)
</P>
<P>
   Accommodations were comfortable, if not elegant. We stayed in
the Virginian, a carpeted, pine-paneled motel-like building: The
kids had their own room next to but not adjoining ours. The staff
was friendly, and the food abundant and hearty American fare,
though by no means designed for the gourmet. (Sample entrees: roast
beef and pork loins, and for the kids, pizza bagels and chicken
nuggets.)
</P>
<P>
   Warning to parents: Eastover is a BYOB zone. Warning to
children: Eastover is a TV-free zone, except for the one television
we saw in the mansion library. Give it up and try skiing. Or wedge
yourself into that scary toboggan, and have the ride of your life.

INTEL OFFERS COMPROMISE ON ID CHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Stung by an uproar from privacy groups, Intel
Corp. is changing a feature on its latest microprocessors that
would automatically identify an individual computer on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But privacy advocates expressed reservations about the
modification, while the Federal Trade Commission plans to meet with
Intel representatives later this week to discuss the change.
</P>
<P>
   Intel said last week that every new Pentium III chips would
transmit a unique serial number internally and across the Internet
to help identify computer users.
</P>
<P>
   According to the company, that feature would help electronic
commerce, enabling companies and customers more security with
personal data.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Tom Waldrup said the Santa Clara, Calif.-based chip
maker would change the software that came with the chips and
controlled this identification process.
</P>
<P>
   After the change, he said, a Pentium III-equipped computer will
be set so that the identification signal broadcast is disabled. A
user will have to manually change a software program in the
computer to allow the computer to send its identifying information
over a network.
</P>
<P>
   Waldrup said the change had been made Monday in response to
privacy groups advocating the boycott of the new chips, due out
this quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made this change out of concern for the least
sophisticated user,'' Waldrup said. ``That seems to be the group
that privacy advocates are concerned about.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the advocacy groups calling for the boycott said the
change was cosmetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is their little software patch,'' said Dave Banisar,
policy director of the Washington, D.C.-based Electronic Privacy
Information Center. ``It's not really changing the technology. It
doesn't solve the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still Big Brother inside instead of `Intel Inside,''' he
said, referring to Intel's corporate slogan.
</P>
<P>
   EPIC had organized the boycott of Pentium III chips along with
Junkbusters Corp. of Green Brook, N.J., a lobbying concern.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Catlett, president of Junkbusters, was less critical of
Intel's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a big improvement,'' said Catlett, who plans on meeting
with Intel Thursday. ``I need to look at the technical details, but
if the default setting is off, then that is a considerable
improvement in their position.''
</P>
<P>
   Waldrup said the chip manufacturer had consulted with privacy
groups, including EPIC, about the new technology before it was
announced last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognized early on this would be sensitive,'' Waldrup
said. ``That's why we contacted these privacy groups under our own
initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   Banisar, though, said Intel hadn't been frank with his
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came at us with this `we've got a secret' stuff, and
didn't really tell us the details of this new technology,'' Banisar
said.
</P>
<P>
   Waldrup said the identifying technology was going to be included
in the Pentium III chips released in the next two months. The
Pentium III chip is Intel's high-end desktop microprocessor.
</P>
<P>
   Waldrup said Intel would not include the technology in its
next-generation Celeron chips, which are used in cheaper machines.
</P>
<P>
   EPIC said it planned to meet this week with the FTC to discuss
the Intel situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it's a very big concern,'' said Jodie Bernstein,
director of the FTC's bureau of consumer protection. ``But we'll
have to wait and see if this will really resolve the total privacy
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein said Intel representatives would brief the agency on
the new chips Thursday, and added that the FTC would take action if
there was any indication that Intel was engaging in any ``unfair or
deceptive'' business practices.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein said she was heartened by the quick response of Intel
to the privacy concerns. ``That's usually the fastest way to
resolve these controversies,'' she said.

DOLLARS AND NONSENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN LEVINGSTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; To do business overseas, especially in cudgel-wielding
dictatorships, the savvy executive adopts a three-point strategy:
1) See No Evil, 2) Hear No Evil, 3) Speak No Evil. In the spirit of
this philosophy, I present today in my capacity as chairman of the
billion-dollar multinational Make a Buck at Any Cost Corp. my
special report on American Business Sentiment Toward Burma.
</P>
<P>
   Let's begin with the government's own view of life in this
Southeast Asian paradise of more than 47 million people. In the
words of the ruling junta, Burma is one of the most pleasant places
created by Mother Nature. I couldn't agree more.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, anti-business fanatics delight in squawking about the
occasional tiffs between the people of Burma and their military
rulers. Yes, Rangoon cracked down on protests in 1988, killing
thousands to restore order. Yes, the government ignored results of
an election in 1990 clearly indicating that 90 percent of the
people rejected its rule and wanted democracy. And, yes, it placed
the elected victor, Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi,
under house arrest. Yes, many of Suu Kyi's party members have been
killed, jailed, or forced into exile. Yes, the rulers practice
torture, turn a blind eye to slavery, and traffick in drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Is this any concern of ours? As long as imprisonments, torture,
slavery, and political repression don't hinder business, let's not
get in a huff about it. These spats will work themselves out.
</P>
<P>
   I will say just one thing to those who whine about human rights:
We will battle all attempts to impose on us a social conscience.
Are we in business to save the world or make a profit? Lately, I'm
pleased to report, we've seen some progress in silencing the
wild-eyed whiners.
</P>
<P>
   Right here in Massashusetts, we finally crushed a radical law
late last year that bans state contracts with companies doing
business with Burma. We applaud the clever logic of the National
Foreign Trade Council, which took the battle into the courts on
behalf of its 580 corporate members. The judge, in his wisdom,
agreed with the council that the state law was unconstitutional. Of
course! What right does Massachusetts, or any state, have to make
its own foreign policy?
</P>
<P>
   But no sooner did we lop off the head of this human rights demon
than another beast sprung up in its place. A month after the
Massachusetts law was struck down, the Los Angeles city council
voted unanimously to enact a similar ban on the municipal level.
</P>
<P>
   If only these were the few isolated attacks on us. But more than
two dozen other states and cities are discussing or have already
passed laws that target trade with not only Burma but other
promising markets like Nigeria, Indonesia, and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Already some companies have retreated from Burma on moral
grounds. It breaks my heart. If a company must withdraw, it is far
better to do it proudly for manly businesslike reasons _ not from
any moral squeamishness.
</P>
<P>
   Let us all hail Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications giant.
It ended operations in Burma last year because of threats of a
worldwide consumer boycott. The company stated in unequivocal terms
that its decision was not based on ethics _ it was, as it should
be, purely a commercial move.

BOGLE SOUNDS OFF ON SOCIAL SECURITY REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Bogle thinks the debate over Social Security is surely
leading to the establishment of personal accounts invested at least
partly in the stock market, and he's got no problem with that.
</P>
<P>
   His one warning: Don't let the mutual fund industry get its
hands on the money.
</P>
<P>
   Bogle, the famous skinflint senior chairman of Vanguard Group,
does not think fund managers should be running Social Security
money and wouldn't choose their companies to administer the
accounts. That includes his own Valley Forge, Pa.-based mutual fund
company.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Bogle is returning to his favorite theme: expense
control. He argues that very small accounts are more likely to get
eaten alive by the management and administration expenses typically
charged by mutual fund companies today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cost is a powerful component,'' said Bogle.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over Social Security reform is far from settled,
though most people now seem to agree that some kind of stock market
investment should be part of any plan to ensure the program has
enough money to cover the retirement of the baby boom generation.
Democrats want one pool of Social Security reserve money invested
in the market, while Republicans are pressing for individual
accounts that would let taxpayers decide how to put some of their
money to work.
</P>
<P>
   One wild card: President Clinton's new idea of a Universal
Savings Account for low- to moderate-income workers, similar to an
employer-sponsored 401(k) plan. The government would use part of
the government's projected surplus to match money saved by workers,
within limits.
</P>
<P>
   Bogle sees something like Clinton's USA account being adapted to
the Social Security debate, creating individual accounts that would
be directed by worker-taxpayers. He thinks about 1 percent of
salary contributed to Social Security by employers and another 1
percent kicked in by employees would be available for the accounts
to invest.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that makes the idea intelligent is that it's
the way our pension plans are going in this country,'' said Bogle,
referring to the growth of 401(k) defined contribution plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``A typical pension plan funded with, say, 60 percent stocks and
40 percent bonds is a perfectly intelligent option for the average
employee. But it isn't intelligent for either person at the
extremes of the (age) average. There ought to be some way to
control for that in our national retirement program,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bogle's beef with mutual funds as managers or administrators of
individual Social Security accounts boils down to fees: investment
fees, transaction fees, and administration fees.
</P>
<P>
   Those costs don't raise much of a fuss among most mutual fund
customers today, despite Bogle's best efforts. But applied to very
small accounts, they could wipe out the long-term profit advantage
investors expect as a reward for taking risk in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could easily turn out with those kinds of costs that when
someone looks back 20 years from now, the individual (stock Social
Security) accounts run by this industry will underperform the bond
market,'' Bogle said.
</P>
<P>
   His solution: strip the accounts down to their bare-bones, index
stock market investing backed by no-frills service, and individual
accounts are much more likely to deliver some real benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Who should administer the accounts? The Social Security
bureaucracy can do it, Bogle thinks. Who actually handles the nuts
and bolts of investing new money into index stocks? The government
could do that, too. Running an index fund, especially one that
doesn't have to cope with unpredictable daily cash flow changes,
isn't rocket science. If that doesn't work, contract the job out to
any investment firm and demand rock-bottom pricing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not recreating the mutual fund industry,'' he said.
``We're creating a product that if the mutual fund industry had it,
it would be better.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's a model that looks a lot like a government
version of Vanguard, a giant investment management firm owned by
the people who buy its funds and managed to keep their expenses
low. Vanguard has popularized investing in index funds, which
mirror the components of benchmarks such as the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 or the Russell 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Bogle thinks the entire operation could be run for as little as
10 basis points, or 0.1 percent of assets, per year. That's even
lower than the fee charged by the Vanguard 500 Index fund, which
invests in Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index stocks and charges its
investors 0.18 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 10th of a percent ought to be plenty. If you looked at all
the money (in a Social Security stock program), you would wonder
where a 10th of a percent could even go.''
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Robin Rouse and her family have been to many bar and bat mitzvah
celebrations in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   There was the one with the South Pacific theme: The room was
decorated in island colors, and the guests received leis and
maracas. There was the Miami Heat basketball theme party, the
Broadway production party, and the formal New York black tie event
where, for the grand finale, waiters wheeled out a lavish Viennese
pastry table and ``everyone oohed and aahed,'' Rouse recalled.
</P>
<P>
   So, when the time came four years ago to plan her own son's bar
mitzvah, young Ryan had a question for Rouse. ``What's the theme of
my bar mitzvah going to be?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theme of your bar mitzvah,'' she told him, ``is bar
mitzvah.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, (itals)duhhhh(unitals), as a seventh grader might say.
</P>
<P>
   You might think the focus of the bar or bat mitzvah would be on
its intended purpose _ the religious coming of age of a 13-year-old
Jewish boy or girl. And for a great many families, it is. But over
the last 15 years, some of these celebrations have _ in the view of
many in the Jewish community _ gone soaring over the top, with
their black-tie dinners, costly entertainers, and ``room
transformations'' in which hotels and temples alike are made over
into rain forests or circuses.
</P>
<P>
   But change is afoot. There is a growing movement to shift the
emphasis back onto the spiritual and religious aspects of the bar
or bat mitzvah, during which boys and girls read or chant in Hebrew
from the Torah and interpret sacred texts.
</P>
<P>
   Like big corporations, like early retirees, American bar and bat
mitzvahs are beginning to downsize.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen three clear trends,'' writes Rabbi Joshua Hammerman
of Stamford, Conn., in New York-based Jewish Week magazine. ``1)
the service is becoming more central, 2) the parties more modest,
and 3) those who still insist on `doing it up' are more
self-conscious.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbis and others involved in synagogue life in Massachusetts
echo his observation: from Temple Shalom in Newton, where executive
director Bob Isaacs reports seeing ``fewer monster parties'' and
``more focus on what goes on in the sanctuary than what goes on in
the party;'' to Temple Aliyah in Needham, where Rabbi Carl Perkins
says more parents are using the event as an opportunity not just to
celebrate but to ``enrich their family's Jewish life;'' to the
North Shore, where parents from such communities as Marblehead,
Peabody, Everett, Revere, and Malden have formed a ``Mitzvah coop''
to plan and prepare each other's parties, bypassing the expense of
caterers, decorators, even photographers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The downsizers include families like Robin Rouse's of West
Newton, Mass., who with her husband, Brian Gallagher, hosted a
simple lunch in a restaurant for about 50 family members and
friends, following their son's ceremony at Temple Emanuel, a
conservative congregation in Newton. A family friend who is a DJ
entertained the kids. And in lieu of table centerpieces, the family
took the money that would have been spent on table decorations and
made donations to several charities. Each donation was made in the
name of a particular guest whom the family wanted to honor. The
entire cost of the party came in ``well under $3,000,'' Rouse say,
substantially less than the $10,000 and $15,000 parties she has
attended.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one,'' maintains Rouse, ``should be spending 10, 15, or 18
thousand dollars on a child's religious ceremony.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that she hasn't enjoyed such costly parties. On the
contrary, ``I have such a great time when I go to them. I know
people are doing them because they can'' afford to, says Rouse, a
former teacher in the Jewish community who now works as a technical
writer at Lotus Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   She adds, ``But at some point along the way, you say to
yourself, ``Are these the values we are supposed to be passing on
to our children? For me, there is too big a chasm between the
meaning of the celebration and the method of celebrating. It's such
a dissonant way to mark a child's beginning a path into
(itals)mitzvot(unitals),'' performing good, ethical deeds.
</P>
<P>
   Some celebrations reflect deeper concerns. Emily Newberg, a
ninth-grader at Belmont (Mass.) High School, has always been
interested in the Holocaust, which she considers ``more compelling
than any other subject I've studied so far.'' So she decided to use
her bat mitzvah as an opportunity to honor the sacrifices made by
victims and heroes of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   In the months leading up to her bat mitzvah at Belmont's Beth El
Temple Center, she became involved with the Jewish Foundation for
the Righteous, a New York-based organization that provides
assistance to surviving Christians who rescued Jews during the
Holocaust. She also participated in a program that twins a bar or
bat mitzvah child with a Jewish boy or girl who died in the
Holocaust before turning 13.
</P>
<P>
   There are families like the Borgenichts of Dover, Mass., for
whom throwing a big party last August for their daughter Sarita's
Bat Mitzvah was, for them, simply out of the question, even though
they could have afforded it. Instead, they hosted a quiet buffet
luncheon for family and a few friends in their temple's social
hall. ``I personally do not like and don't support taking anything
away from the experience,'' Fred Borgenicht says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Such simpler celebrations are increasingly common. Why now?
</P>
<P>
   Rabbis speculate it reflects a general return among Americans to
spiritualism and simplicity. And some rabbis see an increasing
self-consciousness among Jewish parents about much-publicized
displays of excess. (One that drew front-page coverage in Boston's
Jewish Advocate involved a ``fashion cafe'' party at a country
club, featuring a Cindy Crawford supermodel look-alike greeting
guests.)

CHAFEE, `NOT A WEATHERVANE,' DEFENDS HIS STANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARWICK, R.I. _ This is Chafee territory, home to descendants of
the founding Rhode Island family, where the mayor is a Chafee and
everyone knows someone with the last name. And these days, some
people have a dilemma: Senator John H. Chafee.
</P>
<P>
   The problem isn't what he's done. After 22 years in the Senate,
Chafee is as beloved as Republicans get in this overwhelmingly
Democratic state, a model moderate who supports everything from the
environment to abortion rights. The problem, instead, is what
Chafee hasn't done about impeachment _ and what some fear he might
do next.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Chafee, 76, said he would vote to hear
witnesses in President Clinton's impeachment trial and oppose a
swift up-or-down vote to dismiss the case. Democratic leaders,
mindful of Chafee's reelection looming in 2000, seized on this
stance and began plotting his demise around it. And longtime Chafee
supporters, like Phyllis Zito, are their prime target.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's done a good job,'' said Zito, 53, a former
schoolteacher, as she settled into a booth at the Newport Creamery
in Warwick over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as this thing goes on,'' added Zito, who voted for Chafee
in all four of his Senate races, ``I see he's more concerned with
party lines than what his constituents are saying. And that bothers
me. I think that I'd have to think long and hard about whether I'd
vote for him again.''
</P>
<P>
   Such opinions are a delight to Democratic leaders in Rhode
Island, who have salivated over Chafee's Senate seat since he first
won in 1976, and have long been irritated by his ability to secure
huge portions of the liberal vote. They have sprung into action.
Last week, Representative Patrick J. Kennedy took to the airwaves
with a string of blistering attacks, accusing Chafee of ``getting
rolled'' by conservatives. The People for the American Way also
launched a series of radio ads in Providence geared toward getting
voters to ask their senators to end the impeachment trial _ a
tactic clearly aimed at Chafee, since the other Rhode Island
senator, Jack Reed, is a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Bill Lynch, the state chairman of the
Democratic Party, all but announced his candidacy for Chafee's
seat, saying the senator's inaction would undoubtedly star in any
future campaign. Last Friday, the Providence branch of the NAACP
said it sent Chafee a letter pleading with him to alter his
position, and its president, Clifford R. Montiero, later said
campaign support would be contingent on what Chafee does next.
</P>
<P>
   ``I led Democrats for Governor Chafee in 1962. I would lead
Democrats against Senator Chafee in 2000 if he feels it is
important to crucify one of the greatest presidents this country
has ever had in terms of civil rights,'' Montiero said.
</P>
<P>
   Chafee defends his position tirelessly and unapologetically,
explaining to constituents that in impeachment, as in policy
making, he is an independent thinker, ``not a weathervane''
twisting in the winds of public opinion polls. If he votes for a
limited number of witnesses, as is expected, it is because he
believes witnesses are appropriate; if he votes against a motion to
dismiss the case, it is out of respect for the Constitution, not
the Republican Party's right wing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Rhode Island have always supported me in a very
generous fashion,'' Chafee said in an interview. ``They've said,
`We have confidence in you. You go down there and do what you think
is best.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Chafee has survived a number of unpopular policy moves in which
he voted against the state's Democratic grain, including supporting
Clarence Thomas's nomination to the Supreme Court. After the
upheaval over the Thomas hearings, Chafee bucked a liberal tidal
wave and cast an almost-deciding ballot: Thomas was confirmed by
just 52 to 48.
</P>
<P>
   In Clinton's impeachment trial, Chafee again is part of a
crucial bloc of swing votes, joining three other Republicans from
New England _ Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan M. Collins of Maine
and Senator James M. Jeffords of Vermont. All four are moderates,
and together they could help decide key questions, such as whether
to call witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   But Chafee shares a dilemma with a larger swath of his party:
the 12 other Republicans who are facing reelection in 2000 and must
at least wonder what effect their stand on impeachment will have on
voters in their home states.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them _ such as Senator Slade Gorton of Washington, where
65 percent of people polled oppose impeachment _ have made a
concerted effort to appear bipartisan during the trial. Others,
such as Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, whose state opposed
impeachment by 63 percent, have toned down hard-core conservative
rhetoric that once brought them recognition.
</P>
<P>
   But Chafee has not changed his tune, not even after polls last
November showed a full 74 percent of people in Rhode Island wanted
to see the impeachment process end. Nor does he plan to.
</P>
<P>
   ``You listen to what your constituents' views are, you read the
letters, you read the e-mail, but in the final analysis, you have
to do what you believe is right,'' he said. ``I'm not going to
respond to polls _ 62 percent this way, 38 percent that way.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Democrats, he said: ``I've no problem if they want to
use this as an issue. Go to it. I've been perfectly happy to defend
any position.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, there is little for Chafee to defend. He has not
announced whether he will vote to convict Clinton. For some in
Warwick, whatever Chafee does will be fine. Alice Dunne, 81, a
Democrat from Warwick, said she would vote for him again _
especially because she believed Chafee would eventually ``try to
lead the way'' to end the impeachment trial. Dale Davenport, 53, a
Democrat from East Providence, agreed, saying Chafee's role in
impeachment is ``not going to influence what he does for Rhode
Island.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at what the president did _ he's still running the
country,'' Davenport said. Chafee ``can still work for us.''
</P>
<P>
   But for others, questions remained, and some said Chafee's
actions might well influence their vote in 2000. Tania Aguiar, 20,
who works at a mortgage company in Warwick, said ``it would be a
big deal'' for her if Chafee voted to oust Clinton. Sandra Andraee,
22, a sourcing analyst at Fleet, said, ``It should not be about
what he thinks.''
</P>
<P>
   Andraee said senators should consider the public's view, not
just their own. ``If they're not going to represent the people,
they shouldn't be in office,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But, she acknowledged, Chafee ``probably would get reelected
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very well known. He's an institution,'' she said. ``I
don't think the older people would let him go.''
</P>
<P>
   Darrell West, a political science professor at Brown University,
said the poll numbers support the claim that ``Chafee has a strong
reservoir of public support.'' In June 1997, Chafee's job approval
rating was 50 percent; by September 1998, it had shot up to 63
percent, according to West, who regularly polls Rhode Island
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a lot of personal credibility with Rhode Island
voters,'' West said. ``But the $64,000 question is whether this
time is going to be different, because this vote is far more
high-profile than anything he's done in the past. History may not
be the best guide.''

   TAKE-BOS  
 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND: ... he says.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The suites and the limousines and the baby grands are not
provided for Samaranch, his lieutenants say. They are provided for
the IOC president, who has achieved nearly papal status as the
Olympics have become universal in their reach.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch may have collected more plaques, medals, honorary
degrees, and Order of the Whatevers than any other man on earth. He
receives so many ex officio gifts that the IOC puts most of them in
the Olympic museum or in storage.
</P>
<P>
   When it was revealed recently that Salt Lake City had given him
a shotgun and a rifle worth nearly 10 times the IOC's gift limit,
his staffers made a point of unveiling ``The Samaranch Collection''
_ a global rummage basement stuffed with Dutch stamps, oil
portraits, statuettes, dolls, trays, and other commemorative
bric-a-brac that they say the president doesn't want but couldn't
refuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I receive hundreds of gifts,'' Samaranch says. ``I am also
giving gifts. That is the protocol of a normal visit.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not that the president couldn't afford a Browning Gold
semiautomatic shotgun (about $475 retail) if he wanted one.
Samaranch grew up in a wealthy textile family and added to his
fortune by speculating in beachfront real estate and joining
corporate boards. (He is still a director of Spain's largest bank.)
</P>
<P>
   Though he developed a reputation as a youthful playboy,
Samaranch was both ambitious and shrewd, a political realist with
his finger always in the wind, a gifted adapter and survivor whom a
Catalan magazine once dubbed a ``clever chameleon.''
</P>
<P>
   He became a Franco loyalist, joining the Movimiento, wearing the
blue fascist shirt and saluting with upraised arm. Samaranch ended
up not only as Catalan regional councilor but Franco's sports
minister, which landed him a place on the IOC in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Though he had been a middling athlete (a featherweight boxer who
fought as ``Kid Samaranch'' and a roller hockey goalie),
Samaranch's obvious talent was for inside diplomacy. He quickly
became the IOC's head of protocol, made the powerful executive
board, and became a vice president in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   When Franco died three years later and Samaranch realized his
political and social life in Spain was finished, he asked to be
ambassador to the Soviet Union. Though Austria had been offered,
Vienna was not hosting the next Olympics, Samaranch understood.
Moscow was.
</P>
<P>
   When the Spanish government decided to join the US-led boycott
of the 1980 Games after the Afghanistan invasion, Samaranch
persuaded its Olympic committee to send a team anyway. And when
Lord Killanin decided not to stand for reelection that summer,
Samaranch ended up as president.
</P>
<P>
   He quickly set about revolutionizing the Olympic movement, which
was reeling after consecutive boycotts, bereft of host cities for
the Games and still stuck in founder Baron Pierre de Coubertin's
19th-century ideal of amateur sport as practiced by the English
upper classes.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch named women to the IOC's all-male club (there were a
dozen before Finland's Pirjo Haeggman resigned last week). He
broadened its Eurocentricity by nominating new members from Africa,
Asia, and Latin America, which now make up half of the committee.
He had the word ``amateur'' removed from the Olympic charter and
pushed to let professionals compete. And he created a marketing
machine with Horst Dassler, the Adidas sporting goods magnate that
has poured billions into the IOC coffers, more than 90 percent of
which has been passed on to international sports federations and
national Olympic committees.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1984 boycott of Los Angeles, Samaranch set about
drawing the Soviet bloc back into the fold by giving dictators such
as Romania's Nicolae Ceaucescu, East Germany's Erich Honecker, and
Bulgaria's Todor Zhivkov the IOC's highest honor: the golden
Olympic Order. The past three Olympiads have featured virtually
full attendance, with every country sending six athletes and two
officials to each Games at IOC expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``These 18 years have not been only the black days we are having
today, no?'' Samaranch mused Monday. ``We have also had very bright
days.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was the bright days, ironically, that spawned the black days.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense, with certain footnotes and asterisks, Samaranch
has fulfilled the mandate and dream of Coubertin _ to make the
Games truly universal,'' says John Lucas, a Penn State professor
emeritus and Olympic historian. ``But at a great price.''
</P>
<P>
   The bigger and richer and more popular the Olympics became, the
more cities craved them _ and the more the IOC members found
themselves being offered, and sometimes asking for, cash and gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are able to meet people who are eager to do anything to
seduce you,'' IOC director general Francois Carrard says. ``A small
gesture becomes a big gesture. That is where the temptations begin.
Some members were not able to resist as they should have.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch was profoundly embarrassed that some of his colleagues
would betray their oath for cash and cosmetic surgery, for tuition
and jobs for their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very much surprised and disappointed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he realizes that the ongoing investigation into other bid
cities from other years, six Games in all, may lead to other
expulsions in March and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will keep cleaning,'' Samaranch vows.
</P>
<P>
   The Salt Lake scandal has not soiled him personally, though if
his colleagues ask him to step down he will step down, Samaranch
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my duty now is to try to solve the problem and leave the
Olympic movement as strong as possible to the next president,'' he
said.

 &HT;    CHINESE RESUME DISSIDENT CRACKDOWN, ACCUSE POLITICAL MAVERICK OF
SEEING PROSTITUTES
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ After nearly a month's lull, Chinese security
authorities have resumed their aggressive crackdown on maverick
thinkers, this time hauling in a Beijing factory
manager-turned-intellectual for allegedly consorting with
prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   Peng Ming, the irreverent founder of a discussion group called
China Development Union, was seized Monday by 10 policemen at the
Dayun Night Club on Beijing's southern outskirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a frame-up,'' protested Nie Ying, his wife and mother
of his two children. In a telephone interview, she said Tuesday
that an officer at the Tongzhou police station near the nightclub
had informed her that Peng had been ``subpoenaed for prosecution''
on sex-related charges.
</P>
<P>
   She said that at 11 p.m. Monday, police burst into a private
dining room where Peng and a male friend had been enjoying a
multi-course Chinese dinner. Later, when her husband failed to
return home, she tried to call him on his beeper. When he failed to
answer, she realized he was no longer ``at liberty'' and began
trying to find him, she said.
</P>
<P>
   By late Tuesday, Peng's wife and friends did not know where he
was. District police officials told inquiring reporters that they
had no information on Peng.
</P>
<P>
   Peng's case followed the pattern of four other political
dissidents whose opposition activities were cut short in the last
two months by morals charges that they also claimed were trumped
up.
</P>
<P>
   China Democracy Party activist Han Lifa, who tried to organize a
demonstration in Shanghai during President Clinton's visit to China
last summer, fell into a similar predicament when he went out
drinking with friends in Shanghai last Oct. 23.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, he awoke in police custody facing charges of
patronizing a prostitute, Han said later. In December, Shanghai
authorities sentenced Han to nine months of detention on
prostitution charges.
</P>
<P>
   Sentenced with Han was fellow Democracy Party activist Cai
Guihua, who contended that he was arrested on Oct. 30 while he was
dining with a business partner in a Shanghai hotel. Suddenly, he
said, two women entered the room and disrobed. Police immediately
burst in and arrested him.
</P>
<P>
   In another episode, the Chinese Foreign ministry acknowledged in
late December that two New York-based democracy campaigners who had
slipped back into southern China illegally were sentenced to three
years forced labor. They were charged not just with evading border
police but also with hiring prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   The two men, Zhang Lin and Wei Quanbao, both veterans of the
1989 Tiananmen Square uprising, were arrested Nov. 12 in a barber
shop that authorities insisted was a brothel.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Since Peng, the latest detainee, emerged from obscurity less
than a year ago, he has always claimed he is not a ``dissident''
since he isn't trying to form an opposition political party.
Instead, he said, he has just been tossing out reform ideas for
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Peng attracted Western media attention last summer when he began
holding weekly discussion sessions in Beijing on such topics as
human rights, democracy and environmental degradation. But last
fall, he told Western reporters he was curtailing his activities
``until things loosened up again.''
</P>
<P>
   His decision last October to suspend the activities of the China
Development Union was prompted by a raid on his home, in which
police confiscated fax machines, computer equipment and some files
on his tiny organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that's interesting about the new case against Peng
is that he has not been very active at all for the last few
months,'' said Liu Si Qing, director of the Hong Kong-based
Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in
China.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Chinese security agents have adopted
divide-and-rule tactics to keep the handful of dissidents still in
China off balance.
</P>
<P>
   While targeting some lesser-ranking protesters with tawdry sex
accusations, the government crashed down much harder late last
month on the three main leaders of the incipient China Democracy
Party. Chinese courts sent Xu Wenli, Qin Yongmin and Wang Youcai to
prison for at least 11 years each for such crimes as ``attempting
to overthrow state power.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came a pause in the pace of new prosecutions lasting almost
a month.
</P>
<P>
   The round-up resumed last week when a court in Shanghai imposed
a lighter sentence on cyberspace dissident Lin Hai, a 30-year-old
web page designer who was convicted of exchanging e-mail addresses
with a dissident group based in the United States. Lin got two
years.
</P>
<P>
   The scattered episodes of sex-related charges coincide with a
renewed campaign by Chinese authorities to stamp out prostitution,
which was virtually eliminated in the 1960s during the moralistic
days of Communist Party fanaticism. Since economic liberalization
began in 1979, small-scale prostitution has crept back into urban
life, coinciding with the spread of factory layoffs and the growing
gap between wealthy and impoverished Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, according to state media, a Chinese court
sentenced a 41-year-old woman to be executed for running a
prostitution ring while using a sauna and restaurant as a front.

ZENGA HAS A ZEST FOR THE TASK AT HAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ There is a great deal of evidence supporting
the observation that Walter Zenga has a winning touch. But Zenga
denies it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a winning touch, I have a hunger to win,'' Zenga
said Monday. ``There is a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Zenga, 39, has returned to the Revolution as player-coach. He
seems rejuvenated, prepared for the challenge of elevating a team
that has the MLS' worst record after three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   There will be few roster changes and no major stars are expected
to be added, including Giuseppe Bergomi, who had been rumored to be
a Revolution candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' Zenga said of his former teammate at
Internazionale.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a different mentality within the team, though.
Zenga brings not only a desire to succeed, but also a great deal of
credibility. The trick will be for Zenga to translate his success
as a player to that of a player-coach.
</P>
<P>
   Two veteran defenders _ Brian Bliss and Dan Calichman _ should
help stabilize the Revolution defense. Ze Rodrigues, Giovanni
Savarese, and possibly Sierra Leone's Unisa Conteh could change the
offensive dynamic.
</P>
<P>
   But the Revolution also will be without the league's leading
scorer, Raul Diaz Arce, lost to San Jose in a trade. Missing from
training camp will be captain Mike Burns, who is on trial with
Hearts in Scotland; midfielder Shawn Medved, who is in a contract
dispute; Imad Baba, Jamar Beasley, and Joe-Max Moore (with national
teams); goalkeeper Ian Feuer, who is on loan to Rushden and
Diamonds in England; and Jeff Causey, Edwin Gorter, and Carlos
Rocha, who are also training in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga's task will be to tie this project together, setting the
tone from the first day of training, which will start indoors, then
move to Italy's Tirennian Coast, in preparation for the season
opener at Miami March 28.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Zenga displayed an alchemist's touch in transforming
a team that had split into cliques and had sunk to the bottom of
the league under Thomas Rongen. The Revolution surrendered two
quick goals to Miami in the first half of Zenga's first game as
coach, then quickly galvanized and set team defensive records with
three successive shutouts.
</P>
<P>
   In the 29 games Zenga has participated in as coach or player,
the Revolution have a 14-11-4 record and a 45-37 goal differential.
Without Zenga, the Revolution are 15-44-8 and have been outscored,
138-91.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures indicate that the Revolution also are hungry for
victories. But, so far, they have been unable to devise how to
acquire them.
</P>
<P>
   For Zenga, the formula for success is simple. You start by
organizing the defense, something that rarely has been emphasized
with the Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean the Revolution will be playing for 0-0 ties,
a endgame that has been legislated out of fashion even in Italy by
FIFA's 3-points-for-a-win edict. They will, however, be playing by
the philosophy that if the other team doesn't score, you can't
lose. There is a difference, and Zenga hopes to transmit this to
the Revolution in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a place where soccer is No. 1 in the thoughts of the
people,'' Zenga said. ``You will not lose by going there to train.
We will train against Italian teams and when we return we will be
ready to play in MLS.''
</P>
<P>
   Several professional teams are based near Forte dei Marmi, the
Revolution's Tuscan base. Zenga has the connections not only to
secure accommodations and facilities at cut rates, but also to set
up exhibitions against top clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Revolution supporters likely would settle for a few rays of hope
after a dismal '98, when the team was eliminated from playoff
contention with a month left in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am always optimistic, in everything I do,'' Zenga said. ``I
want to give entertainment to the people who come to the stadium.
They appreciated what we did in the last six games last year. What
we did in the last part of the season was positive.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cap flap
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The MLS' salary cap is causing players to seek better offers
elsewhere, and some are succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   Former US national team captain John Harkes will leave D.C.
United for a three-month loan to Nottingham Forest in England's
Premier League. United already lost Tony Sanneh to Hertha Berlin
and Tampa Bay lost Frankie Hejduk to Bayer Leverkusen, both on
long-term contracts. San Jose's Eric Wynalda is on loan to Leon in
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Burns and Feuer seem intent on leaving the Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The league has said take it or leave it,'' said Burns's agent,
Craig Sheron. ``For Mike Burns to walk away, (the offer) has to be
bad. Mike is not asking for a lot. He could ask for the maximum and
he is not asking for that. He is willing to play for New England
for a lot less money than he would earn overseas. He would love to
stay in New England, it's far and away his first choice. But he's
28, and this is possibly his last long-term contract, and he is not
prepared to accept what MLS is offering.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns has 76 national team appearances. He was among the first
to sign with the MLS in 1995, at a base pay of about $80,000. The
league has offered a 10 percent raise. Burns is requesting about
$150,000 in base pay, according to a source.
</P>
<P>
   Sheron believes the MLS is risking too much by allowing US
players to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``The league is dismantling its most credible asset,'' Sheron
said. ``They are being overly preoccupied with the bottom line on a
short-term basis. It's a given that they are not going to get the
big-name overseas players, and they need to invest in domestic
players and keep them. If they don't develop from within, keep the
Mike Burnses and Tony Sannehs, they are going to end up with a
bunch of no-names and people are not going to watch them.''
</P>
<P>
   The next to go could be last season's leading scorer, Stern John
of Columbus, who has an offer from Bayer Leverkusen.
</P>
<P>
   The MLS is taking steps to retain young talent by expanding its
Project 40 program to include foreigners. Candidates include South
African Stephen Armstrong of Butler University, Ukrainian Demo
Kovalenko of Indiana, Brazilian Maurizio Rocha of Connecticut, and
Ghanaian Duke Shamo of St. Francis. Armstrong, a striker, is
polished enough to bypass Project 40, which provides educational
funds and does not occupy a roster spot. One MLS team expressed
interest in selecting Armstrong as its fourth foreign player,
outside of Project 40 considerations.

IF LT GETS INTO HALL, HE WON'T BE SORRY 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (itals)``The only criteria for election to the Pro Football Hall
of Fame is a nominee's achievements and contributions as a player,
coach or contributor in professional football.''(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   _ Pro Football Hall of Fame bylaws, Section 3, Item C &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI _ To become a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame,
Lawrence Taylor needs 29 out of 36 voters to interpret Section 3,
Item C literally.
</P>
<P>
   That might not happen.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was, and, is, a rogue. He did what he did and he does
what he does and he is eternally unrepentant. His laundry list of
drug offenses, tax problems, and transgressions such as leaving the
scene of an accident are not supposed to have anything to do with
his qualifications for the Hall of Fame, but they do. If only LT
would say what some people want to hear, he probably would be a
unanimous choice when the committee convenes Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   He won't do it, and that's why he's LT. There will be no mea
culpas. ``I don't apologize for anything,'' he said via conference
call Monday. ``I live my life the way I live my life.'' He wants
people to understand that part of the reason he was such a
phenomenal player is that he had no inhibitions, on or off the
field. He is daring voters to take the whole package, rap sheet and
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the bylaws,'' he said, ``it should be a no-brainer.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on his talent, it may be the ultra no-brainer of all-time.
More than a few reputable people believe he was the greatest
defensive player ever, at any position. At the very least, he
redefined linebacking. On the basis of athletic merit, the Pro
Football Hall of Fame may never have been presented with a more
obvious candidate for enshrinement.
</P>
<P>
   But the sticky issue of the ``other'' Lawrence Taylor bothers
some people. Some people are morally troubled by the idea of his
bust being on display in Canton, Ohio, where grandmothers and kids
can see it. When they think of LT, they think of rehabs and drug
busts and ``You-have-the-right-to-remain-silents'' as much as they
do of quarterback sacks.
</P>
<P>
   And they are troubled by that, bylaws or no bylaws.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have a hard time with it,'' acknowledged voter Steve
Schoenfeld of the Arizona Republic, who says he is leaning toward a
no vote but has not made up his mind. ``This is a guy who talked
about rehabbing on the golf course. That's hard to take.''
</P>
<P>
   To which LT has a three-word (implied) reply: ``Get a life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to start going by off-the-field stuff, you
might have to kick out half the people in that Hall of Fame right
now,'' he sneered.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if everything is in the past tense with Taylor,
either. He's got a major legal situation pending. Sometimes it
seems he always does. If they put him in the Hall, who's to say he
won't do something to embarrass the place in the next couple of
years? Then again, O.J. has been in the Hall a long time, as I'm
sure LT would gladly point out.
</P>
<P>
   So what does all this mean to a guy like LT, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important, simply because it's a reward for the years you
put into the league,'' he conceded. ``It's the finest reward you
can get in football. It doesn't take much to make me happy, but I
have family and friends who would like to see me get in, and I
would like it to happen for them.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those friends is Bill Parcells. Throughout Taylor's
endless run-ins with the law and his long history of antisocial
behavior, The Tuna has remained completely loyal to his old
quarterback killer. Now here's a guy with a family who certainly
knows right from wrong. I've often wondered how Parcells could
defend such a recidivist slug. Last week I found out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will always stand by Lawrence Taylor,'' The Tuna said in a
TV interview. ``He made me what I am today.''
</P>
<P>
   That tells you all you need to know about LT the player, that a
coach not exactly known for his humility says a thing like that.
But talent is not the issue.
</P>
<P>
   No, the issue is that LT is a guy who always has bent the rules
and who, in his early 40s, really doesn't sound as if he's learned
anything. Americans are the most forgiving people on earth. All
anyone has to do is ask.
</P>
<P>
   LT won't ask us for anything, certainly not from mere
sportswriters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only one I have to answer to is God almighty,'' he
declared. ``I live my life the way I live my life. Yes, I have some
problems, but who doesn't?''
</P>
<P>
   He actually said all this in a reasonably good-natured way.
Asked, for example, if he felt a kinship with Bill Clinton, he
said, ``I can't see what the hoopla is all about. So he had a
run-in? Come on.''
</P>
<P>
   Understand that Taylor is not lobbying for the Hall. We asked
him to take time out from his acting duties (he's appearing in an
Oliver Stone movie, ``On Any Given Sunday,'' being shot in South
Florida), not the other way around. He knows he belongs in the Hall
of Fame on merit. He has no control over the process. Whatever
happens, happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't be sitting around by the phone,'' he asserted. ``And
if you're going to ask me to be remorseful for what I've done, I
can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nope. He's LT, and we can agree on one thing for sure: The man
is consistent.

FALCONS DEFENSE NO LONGER OFFENSIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ So much is new about these Atlanta Falcons. Consider
this insight from Chuck Smith, a defensive lineman and most
articulate student of football: One of the main reasons the
Falcons' defense was for so long buried in the bilge of the NFL
cellar was the team's offense.
</P>
<P>
   Hmmmmm. The defense was bad because of the offense? This
demanded some elaboration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough, just tough to go out there for practice because
we were so bad,'' said Smith, who grew in nearby Athens, Ga.
``Everybody wants to win in this league and we were losing. And it
was even tougher to understand because Georgia is a football state
_ we're down South and this is football country. I remember growing
up and before we'd get on the school bus in the morning, we'd be
playing football, everybody, even the girls.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Falcons were virtually ignored in Georgia, because they
were bad, and not bad in the good sense. They were very bad,
especially the defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd go to the stadium on game day and you knew, on the
defense, that you didn't have a chance going into the game,'' Smith
went on.
</P>
<P>
   Smith searched his mind for explanations; heck, he thought,
Deion Sanders was playing corner, and he was the best corner in
football. Jessie Tuggle was at middle linebacker ``and what's
Jessie been?,'' asked Smith. ``An All-Pro five times and an
alternate four other years? Jessie'd be in the Hall of Fame already
if he'd been playing on a good team.''
</P>
<P>
   And still the Falcons defense was putrid.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a reason why we were playing such bad defense; we
were setting records we were so bad,'' Smith elaborated. ``It all
starts at the top; guys wanted to do well but they couldn't because
of certain reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   A major reason, Smith concluded, ``was because of the
run-and-shoot offense we had, and that's all we ever practiced
against on defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The run-and-shoot was the offense of head coach June Jones, and
the offense was flashy and flamboyant and exciting and many things;
but, of course, the run-and-shoot has many receivers but no tight
ends. And, alas for the Atlanta defense, the opposing teams on
Sunday almost always lined up with a tight end or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to understand, I played all those years in the
league and I never even practiced against a tight end,'' said
Smith. ``That's why the Falcons were last in run defense. That's
why you play bad defense and you can't stop the run. No one else
puts five receivers out there. I mean, you might get it once in a
while in a game but we got it all the time in practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Smith was wound up. He is an NFL history buff and has a vast
video library of the best pass rushers of all time, from Reggie
White and Lawrence Taylor and Bruce Smith and back to Wilber
Marshall and Carl Eller and even Dick Butkus. The defense Smith was
playing was not the defense he'd seen on all those tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember one year _ I'm sure none of you guys remember any
history about Atlanta because nobody cared then _ but I remember
one year we had seven (defensive) guys pull hamstrings in camp,''
said Smith. ``I mean, they've got 15 receivers there on the offense
and we only only have six or seven defensive linemen and we're
rushing every down. Those receivers are out there running a
thousand go-routes in practice but that didn't help me. Every day,
it seemed, there'd be a thousand pass rushes in practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Smith could take no more. In the last week of the 1996
season, when the Falcons were 3-12, Smith told the Atlanta media
the team needed ``a defensive-minded man'' to lead them and the
team could not exist on ``gimmicks,'' such as the run-and-shoot.
Too much time already had been wasted, too much talent wasted, too,
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones promptly suspended Smith for Atlanta's last game of the
1996 season. Soon thereafter, Jones was fired and replaced by Dan
Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said then we needed a defensive-minded coach to come in here
and until that happened, we'd be losers,'' Smith went on. ``And I
believe that now, because you look at the two teams in this Super
Bowl and they both play defense.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Smith made pains to point out, ``I never said June Jones
should be fired. That was already in the books. That had nothing to
do with me.''
</P>
<P>
   So Smith met with team president Taylor Smith ``and we worked it
out.'' And when Reeves arrived in Atlanta, there were no whispers
or grudges or ``any reason for him to hold anything against me
since he didn't know me and I didn't know him. He just wanted
players out there who'd play.''
</P>
<P>
   And, it must be noted, the Falcons would not be in this Super
Bowl if it weren't for Chuck Smith. Minnesota was leading the
Falcons, 20-7, just before halftime in the NFC title game and the
Vikings again were moving when Smith made a move that freed him to
strip the ball from quarterback Randall Cunningham. Atlanta
recovered, Atlanta scored, and the game no longer was over.
</P>
<P>
   And the record should note that Smith made his move to the
outside of the Vikings left tackle and to the inside of _ you
guessed it _ the tight end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who knows anything about football,'' said Smith,
``knows defense wins championships.''

EL FARNAWANI HAS BEEN HIRED BEFORE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (s, f and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Mahmoud El Farnawani, the Canadian middleman
identified by the International Olympic Committee Sunday as having
received $161,000 from Salt Lake City to ``influence'' North
Africans to support that city's bid for the 2002 Winter Games, also
worked over the years as a paid consultant for other cities seeking
to win the prestigious Games.
</P>
<P>
   According to acquaintances and news reports, the 65-year-old
Egyptian-born entrepreneur from Oakville, Ontario, was paid $60,000
by Sydney to help win the 2000 Summer Olympics and was hired by
Athens as a consultant in its successful bid for the 2004 games. He
has also worked for Toronto, Nagano (Japan), and Istanbul to lobby
North Africans on the Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Nagano was site of the 1998 Winter Games while Toronto, which
bid for the 1996 Summer Games, and Istanbul (2000 Summer Games)
failed in their efforts to be selected as Olympic cities.
</P>
<P>
   El Farnawani was named in this week's report by the executive
board of the IOC on the investigation that led to the recommended
expulsion of six committee members for accepting cash and other
gifts from organizers of the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City.
Four of the officials are Africans, and one is from the North
African nation of Sudan. In addition, two of three IOC members who
have resigned in the scandal are African, one from Libya, the other
from Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic officials say there is no evidence that El Farnawani did
anything wrong in his efforts to convince Olympic Committee members
from North Africa that the Utah city was the best place for the
Games. He was hired by the Salt Lake organizing committee ``on the
basis . . . he might be able to influence North African members,''
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing illegal or improper about that, said El
Farawani's lawyer, David M. Goodman of Toronto, saying the report
exonerates his longtime client.
</P>
<P>
   ``He worked as a lobbyist, as a middleman, as a protocol man,''
but not as a bagman, Goodman said. ``He has been on the periphery
of the Olympics for years and years.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, El Farnawani has worked on the edges of the Olympic
movement since the 1950s, first as a volleyball coach in his native
Egypt and later as a well-paid agent of influence for cities hoping
to snare the games.
</P>
<P>
   He emigrated to Canada in the early 1970s by way of Libya.
</P>
<P>
   ``My belief is I did nothing wrong,'' El Farnawani told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   As president of Trade &AMP; Sports Canada Inc., an Ontario firm that
specializes in sports souvenirs, El Farnawani won a merchandising
franchise for the 1988 Winter Games in Calgary, Alberta.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, El Farnawani has been able to sell his services
to Olympic organizing committees in North America, Asia, and
Australia ``because of his extensive friends and contacts in North
Africa,'' said Goodman. ``He knows a lot of people in that region.
He could be persuasive because he could say, `Hey, I'm a North
African, like you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Along with pitching for Salt Lake City and Sydney, El Farnawani
was able to advise Olympic Committee members about Islamic customs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe something as simple as telling them to be sure not to
serve pork to a Muslim, or that it would be a polite touch to make
sure there is a prayer rug in the hotel room,'' Goodman said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Toronto Star, he worked as an unpaid volunteer
for a Toronto group that tried unsucessfully to win the 1996
Olympics for that city, and more recently was briefly a paid
consultant for Toronto's effort to secure the 2008 Games.

LITTLE-KNOWN FIRM HOPES SUPER BOWL WILL BRING IT FAME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUDSON, N.H. _ Pro Player, Inc., the sports clothing company, is
stuck at the rear of a nondescript industrial park here, off the
road to Nashua.
</P>
<P>
   But, on Sunday, in a broadcast that about one-out-of-two
Americans will watch, the name Pro Player will be featured
prominently, as Fox Broadcasting televises the Super Bowl from Pro
Player Stadium in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   If the past is any guide, Pat Summerall, the venerable
play-by-play announcer, and his colleague, John Madden, are likely
to say the words ``Pro Player Stadium'' at least a few times to an
audience that advertising executives project at about 130 million
viewers. In fact, Fox and its broadcast team have already come
through big for Pro Player, featuring the company's name
prominently last Sunday when Madden announced his annual
``All-Madden Team.''
</P>
<P>
   A mere mention may not be quite the same marketing tool as a
30-second commercial. But while advertising executives say
companies are shelling out $1.6 million for 30-second spots during
the Super Bowl, Pro Player's notices during the broadcast come
entirely from its naming rights deal.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Pro Player, Inc. _ formed from the remnants of
three small, largely unknown firms in 1994 _ say that sort of name
recognition is priceless. Marketing experts say that the 10-year,
$20 million agreement with the stadium owner, H. Wayne Huizenga,
which was struck almost by coincidence in 1995, has proven to be
among the most valuable naming-rights deals in American sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of think of ourselves, this little New England company
up here in New Hampshire, as that Little Mouse That Roared,'' said
Doug Kelly, president and chief operating officer of Pro Player,
Inc. ``And the stadium deal has been a big part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the fact that a company that is not well known was
looking for some recognition, and the fact that there has already
been a World Series there, and now you have the Super Bowl coming
up with all of that marketing power, word around the business is
that it was one of the best stadium-naming deals,'' said Greg Abel,
of Advantage International, the Virginia firm which is a world
power in sports marketing and management.
</P>
<P>
   Pro Player, Inc., a small subsidiary of the apparel giant Fruit
of the Loom, has evolved in five years from a screenprinted T-shirt
and fiber-fill jacket company to the second-largest producer of
licensed sportswear in the country, with sales of about $218
million, according to Sporting Goods Business and other analysts.
It trails only the industry kingpin, Starter, Corp., of New Haven,
Conn. with $300 million in annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   In a business battered by a changing sense of fashion, Pro
Player has managed single-digit growth in sales in recent years
while many of its competitors struggle to maintain pace, according
to industry analysts and company officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people in the licensing business have kind of been
crying the blues,'' Kelly said during an interview as he sat in his
office amid an exurban design and manufacturing complex that feels
worlds away from the mega-media spotlight of the NFL's showcase
game. ``We're excited here about what we think are some great
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   In the space of 10 months beginning in late 1993, Fruit of the
Loom, acquired two small T-shirt screen printing companies, Salem
Sportswear and Artex, and the licensed outerwear company Pro
Player. It also hired Kelly away from Easton Corp., a California
manufacturer of aluminum bats and hockey sticks, where he was
president and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to develop a business plan to present to Fruit of the
Loom and their board of directors basically in a two-week time
frame,'' said the 45-year-old Kelly. ``I basically came up with a
plan that said we should put the majority of our dollars behind the
Pro Player brand, consolidating the operations in all of the
different labels they had in Salem, Artex and the old Pro Player.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advertising and the marketing dollars just don't spread,''
he said. ``We weren't going to get anywhere near the exposure we
were going to need to develop any one of the brands.''
</P>
<P>
   After Kelly's plan was in place, he and a group of Pro Player
vice presidents devised a strategy to grow the new company. Two
early thoughts were: striking a marketing deal with Jimmy Johnson,
a rising star among coaching ranks in the NFL; and another deal
with one of the more independent-minded owners in the league. With
Pro Player doing about 40 percent of its annual sales with NFL
products, the strategies appeared to make sense.
</P>
<P>
   Miami made sense, too, Kelly said, because if you cannot tap
into Manhattan or Los Angeles's influence on fashion _ in a world
looking away from the traditional sports look _ identifying with
South Beach is almost as good.
</P>
<P>
   Leveraging some of the contacts of an 800-pound gorilla, Fruit
of the Loom, Kelly soon found himself talking with Huizenga's
organization about a sponsorship deal, or maybe a deal with
Johnson, or with one of the coaches of Huizenga's other
Florida-based teams, the Marlins of Major League Baseball or the
Panthers of the National Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the dialogue went on,'' Kelly recalled, ``the title
situation came up. American Airlines had approached them about
renaming Joe Robbie Stadium, and one of Huizenga's guys asked me if
Fruit of the Loom would be interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them no,'' Kelly chuckled, face still flushed at the
unexpected good fortune. ``I told them that we would be interested,
as Pro Player.''
</P>
<P>
   Pro Player's deal with Huizenga is at the high end of the range
of naming-rights deals struck in the mid-1990s according to
marketing sources who track the accords.
</P>
<P>
   ``These naming-rights deals can be tricky,'' said Dennis P.
Wilson, a sport economist at the University of Massachusetts,
Amherst. ``It's called the Winner's Curse. Just because you win the
auction doesn't mean you won _ you might have overpaid.''
</P>
<P>
   But those who have evaluated the deal point out that Pro Player
Stadium offers the exposure of both Major League Baseball and the
NFL, as well as a top flight college bowl game _ the Federal
Express Orange Bowl _ every other year.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins played in a World Series in 1997. The Super Bowl is
there this year. In 2002, the National Championship Game in college
football will be played at Pro Player Stadium. Even considering
that the Marlins luck has changed dramatically, with Huizenga
selling off key players and then the team to a new owner, John
Henry, observers say Pro Player is well ahead of the curve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you have somebody like Pro Player, a company that
almost no one could recognize . . . it obviously makes sense to use
some of the marketing budget to buy name recognition,'' said Rick
Burton, of the Warsaw Sports Marketing Center at the University of
Oregon in Eugene. ``They're getting some exposure every time
somebody says, `Live from Pro Player Stadium.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The $2 million annual fee represents about 17 percent of Kelly's
annual advertising budget. He says he spends much of his time
leveraging the stadium exposure _ using the stadium and the Super
Bowl as a backdrop for a current series of ads in Sports
Illustrated and ESPN The Magazine, inviting major accounts down to
the stadium for games and using the Dolphins' cheerleaders to model
a new season's line of clothes at a fashion show in the Dolphin's
locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to use a lot of the rest of the advertising
budget to tell people that we're not just a stadium _ we're an
apparel company,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   The naming-rights deal has paid measureable dividends, he said.
Shortly after the name first appeared on the stadium in Miami,
company research showed that name awareness increased 7 percent, he
said. After the World Series, it was up by 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have the Super Bowl,'' Kelly said, grinning a victor's
grin. ``We are hoping that after it the improvement of our brand
awareness is going to be up by something closer to the mid 30s or
40s.''

   &UR; FOCUS: AMERICANS RETURN TO AMERICAN UNIVERSITY OF BEIRUT:
(Available by 2 p.m., Fri., Jan. 29) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A few Americans are starting to show up again at the American
University of Beirut, once ground zero in the hostage war against
the United States. In 1984, the American president of the school
was assassinated. Professors were being plucked off the streets in
kidnappings. At one point, 60 percent of the student body was from
the United States, but they were all gone by the time the U.S.
State Department slapped a ban on U.S. travel to Lebanon. That ban
was lifted about a year ago, and now there are nine American
students and four American professors back on campus. They offer
hope that Beirut is recovering from the nightmare of civil war.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ENTERTAINMENT: ``ALLY MCBEAL'S'' LING WOO:(Available by 2 p.m.,
Thu., Jan. 28) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The thing about Ling is, nobody on ``Ally McBeal'' stands a
chance against her. This season's most-noticed breakout TV
character, Ling Woo has cold cat eyes, the charm (and kick) of an
antifreeze cocktail, a penchant for bizarre lawsuits and, when it
suits her purposes, the ability to put men in brain lock with her
sexual teasing.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: VIDEO REVIEWS: ``Rush Hour,'' ``Kurt and Courtney,''
``Cube,'' ``Whatever.''

</P>
<P>
   The Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race is an expedition in extremes.
It is a race that attracts heroic competitors and odd personalities
as it snakes across Alaska's rugged terrain.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: DESTINATIONS: As the Panamanian government prepares to
take control of the Panama Canal and surrounding properties, a
massive push has been launched to attract tourists.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   &UR; FOOD: SUPER BOWL FEAST &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to Super Bowl festivities, makeshift snacks from
the shelf just won't cut it. It's time to feast like champions.
Look for inspiration from the NFC champion Atlanta Falcons, the AFC
champs, the Denver Broncos, and the host city of this year's
contest: Miami.

   &UR; WHEELS: FORD RANGER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Its brash big brother, the F-150, may get the hype and media
attention, but the Ford Ranger pickup quietly continues to stretch
its utility with a four-door option that's definitely on the
cutting edge.
</P>
<P>

basically unchanged since its debut, it has earned the dubious
position of being the most overlooked component under the hood.

that more than 14 million African-Americans will be on-line.
Blackfamilies.com, which launched Jan. 18, Martin Luther King Day,
is the newest Web site hoping to tap into this growing user group.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TRENDS: Many alternative and mainstream cartoonists are
finding that the Web is a valuable tool for publishing and
promoting their work.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TECH BRIEFS: Surfing the Web is getting to be a little
like living in a glass house_ much of what you do goes noticed.
Those who run Web sites use things called ``cookies'' and
``referrers'' to see what we search for, but a software product
from a Cambridge, Mass., company blocks cookies for you, without
limiting your access to different Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TECH TOOLS: Computer programs and Web sites will provide
you with the correct date and time in any city, as well as the
longitude and latitude in case you are navigating.
</P>

   WITH: TECHNOBUDDY: Don't pay retail for a computer if you can
help it. First, identify the specifications for the machine you
want to buy. Then go shopping.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOOKS: ``ELEGY FOR IRIS'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The well is dry, the brain atrophied. Iris Murdoch, the last of
the great 20th-century British writers, has Alzheimer's. And yet,
in ``Elegy for Iris,'' a beautifully rendered portrait by her
husband, John Bayley, we are allowed to glimpse the private
sanctuary of the artist's once vital mind. We get to peer through
the opaque windows of a marriage that wouldn't seem nearly so
remarkable had it not spawned such a monumental body of work: 26
novels that have the Protean grandeur, the intellectual richness,
the lyrical luster of Shakespeare or Proust.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: REVIEW: In ``American Beach,'' author Russ Rymer is too
intent on academically documenting the disintegration of
African-American businesses to let his characters take charge.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: REVIEW: ``Angels Flight'' may be author Michael Connelly's
darkest novel yet.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: SKUBE ON BOOKS: The biographer, like any artist, must
possess the intuition and moral imagination to breathe life into
his subject.

   &UR; SCIENCE &AMP; HEALTH &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   In dental chairs, doctors' offices and surgical wards, more
medical professionals are harnessing the power of light and lasers
to diagnose and treat everything from cancer to cavities.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: FOLIC ACID: Women should consume at least 400 micrograms
of folic acid daily. But most women get only half of that amount,
say health specialists.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: HEALTH BRIEFS: After years of holding steady, HIV
infection rates are rising among young gay men in Atlanta, possibly

ELVIS BIOGRAPHER BRINGS FRESHNESS TO LATEST WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MARSHALL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eleven years of Peter Guralnick's life were devoted to
researching and recounting the life of Elvis Presley, someone whose
life so many people thought they already knew in intimate detail _
the unlikely rise, the agonizing fall.
</P>
<P>
   Guralnick did not care how much had been written about Elvis, or
how well people thought they knew him. His own intent as biographer
was clear, unshakable.
</P>
<P>
   ``My aim at the conclusion of the book was to have the reader
say, `Ya, that makes sense,' because I was trying to tell a
credible story and not prompt any more `Oh-my-God!' flashy
headlines,'' Guralnick said in an interview. ``My greatest
aspiration was to present a character and a world that come across
as fresh and make sense on their own terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Guralnick's two-volume account of the life of the King of Rock
'n' Roll is finally finished now, 1,139 pages in all. His acclaimed
1994 volume, ``Last Train to Memphis: The Rise of Elvis Presley,''
has just been joined by ``Careless Love: The Unmaking of Elvis
Presley'' (Little Brown, 651 pages, $27.95), already appearing on
best-seller lists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Careless Love'' tracks Elvis from his 1958 Army service in
Germany to his 1977 death when the drugged and depressed singer was
stricken by a heart attack while sitting on the leather toilet seat
in his Graceland mansion in Memphis. This is a story of pathos and
excess and self-destruction, another sorry tale of how charisma and
celebrity and money cannot purchase happiness, familiar tabloid
fodder then and even now.
</P>
<P>
   But Guralnick's account of all this sensational stuff is much
like the 55-year-old biographer himself _ serious-minded,
non-judgmental, diligent, thorough, unassuming, scrupulous.
</P>
<P>
   Elvis' decline and fall into a bloated Las Vegas parody of
himself may have subjected him to widespread derision and ridicule.
But Guralnick strives, with great success, to elevate the
discussion of this seminal figure, bringing fresh insights into
Elvis' remarkable contributions to American music and culture and
his complex and often-contradictory personality, including what
would prove to be fatal flaws, his tendency toward depression,
isolation and idolatry.
</P>
<P>
   ``He constructed a shell to hide his aloneness, and it hardened
on his back,'' Guralnick writes. ``I know of no sadder story. But
if the last part of Elvis' life had to do with the price that is
paid for dreams, neither the dreams themselves, nor the aspiration
that fueled them, should be forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   As a Boston teen, Guralnick started his long-playing record
collection with an album by Elvis and he remains a great fan of the
man's music. Guralnick readily admits that his favorite Elvis song,
``Trying to Get to You,'' got to him when it was first released in
1955 on Sun Records and still gets to him today, whether in the
original version or many subsequent versions throughout Elvis'
life, the ballad's soaring spirituality always seeming to inspire
the singer and somehow reflect his aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   Guralnick's appreciation for Elvis' music inspires some of the
most compelling writing in his massive account, especially in his
recounting of various all-night recording sessions. But it does not
prevent him from examining, often in day-by-day detail, the
downward spiral of a great, even revolutionary, talent too often
squandered on quickie movies, forgettable tunes and ill-prepared
performances.
</P>
<P>
   What Guralnick does not do much, by design, is analyze. He is
unstinting in his pursuit of what actually happened, what Elvis did
or said or what others around him did (although not much beyond
those principals). But the biographer is almost pathologically
opposed to deciding for readers why something happened or who was
responsible or what that all means. If that frustrates readers who
come to a biography expecting judgments in this rush-to-judgment
age, then so be it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such judgments only speak of the author of the judgment,''
Guralnick emphasized. ``It does not describe the person who is the
subject of the biography. What I'm trying to do is paint a portrait
of sufficient depth that different readers will take different
things from it. The portrait is mine and the framing of the
portrait is mine, but the challenge is to try to paint the portrait
in a way that it paints the person, not provide some pop psychology
one-liners.''
</P>
<P>
   Guralnick's relentless accumulation of detail can at times test
the patience and endurance of anyone who is not a fervent
card-carrying member of the Elvis fan club, especially since the
second portion of his life is almost as much of a downer as the
pills that held the singer in their grip. But there is no denying
that the Elvis who emerges in the pages of ``Careless Love'' is a
real human being, not some celebrity cardboard cutout.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a person of unassuming humility in the maelstrom of
fame, a performer who in the last days of his life was still
worrying over what will his fans think. Here is someone of
impulsive generosity who gave new cars to friends and acquaintances
as if they were boxes of chocolates. Here is someone who was
rigorous in his quest for answers to elemental questions of meaning
and faith, even when they led to unconventional sources that others
might deride, including one trip on LSD.
</P>
<P>
   And here is a person with enough quirks to fill a psychology
textbook: his refusal to have sex with women after they had had
children (including his wife, Priscilla); his infatuation with law
enforcement paraphernalia and personages; his near-mythic
connection to his mother, Gladys, even after her death in 1958; his
rationalizations that he was not a drug-user since what he took and
had administered to him was prescribed by willing doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Elvis' problems with drugs started in the Army when he was
introduced to amphetamines by fellow soldiers who used them to get
through the rigors of all-night field exercises. Then, once out of
the service, it all careened out of control in days of sleep and
nights of partying, with downers to finally knock Elvis out and
uppers to get him going and painkillers of ever-increasing strength
to combat ailments of one kind or another, until his body became a
kind of pharmaceutical lab experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Elvis did not turn blimp from an all-cheeseburger diet. Nor did
he die because he did not eat enough broccoli or oat bran. What
finally happened to Elvis is not that simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``What killed Elvis was a heart attack, but his health was
severely compromised by all the prescription drugs he took,
depressants, cancer drugs, painkillers,'' Guralnick said. ``His
health was undermined by drugs. You can see that in his appearance;
he was bloated from steroids. If you take away his medications,
Elvis might have been a normally overweight man without that
bloating.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what killed Elvis most of all was the death of his spirit.
He was on a course toward his death from late 1973 on; it is
impossible not to see what he was doing then as heading on a
one-way trip. To say that Elvis killed himself might be overstating
things. But he was so deeply self-destructive by then, having
fallen away from his ideals and aspirations and more and more using
drugs to block out reality. He was destroying himself. What Elvis
did was kill himself slowly.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why Guralnick, despite all he now knows about Elvis,
still finds himself often reflecting on ``thoughts of what might
have been.''

   &UR; FOCUS: AMERICANS RETURN TO AMERICAN UNIVERSITY OF BEIRUT:
(Available by 2 p.m., Fri., Jan. 29) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A few Americans are starting to show up again at the American
University of Beirut, once ground zero in the hostage war against
the United States. In 1984, the American president of the school
was assassinated. Professors were being plucked off the streets in
kidnappings. At one point, 60 percent of the student body was from
the United States, but they were all gone by the time the U.S.
State Department slapped a ban on U.S. travel to Lebanon. That ban
was lifted about a year ago, and now there are nine American
students and four American professors back on campus. They offer
hope that Beirut is recovering from the nightmare of civil war.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ENTERTAINMENT: ``ALLY MCBEAL'S'' LING WOO:(Available by 2 p.m.,
Thu., Jan. 28) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The thing about Ling is, nobody on ``Ally McBeal'' stands a
chance against her. This season's most-noticed breakout TV
character, Ling Woo has cold cat eyes, the charm (and kick) of an
antifreeze cocktail, a penchant for bizarre lawsuits and, when it
suits her purposes, the ability to put men in brain lock with her
sexual teasing.

``Cube,'' ``Whatever.''

   &UR; TRAVEL: THE IDITAROD TRAIL &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race is an expedition in extremes.
It is a race that attracts heroic competitors and odd personalities
as it snakes across Alaska's rugged terrain.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: DESTINATIONS: As the Panamanian government prepares to
take control of the Panama Canal and surrounding properties, a
massive push has been launched to attract tourists.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TRAVEL BRIEFS: Air Security International, a 10-year-old
Houston company that provides security services for traveling
executives, has issued a list of what it considers the most
dangerous business-travel destinations in the world last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FOOD: SUPER BOWL FEAST &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to Super Bowl festivities, makeshift snacks from
the shelf just won't cut it. It's time to feast like champions.
Look for inspiration from the NFC champion Atlanta Falcons, the AFC
champs, the Denver Broncos, and the host city of this year's
contest: Miami.

   &UR; WHEELS: FORD RANGER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Its brash big brother, the F-150, may get the hype and media
attention, but the Ford Ranger pickup quietly continues to stretch
its utility with a four-door option that's definitely on the
cutting edge.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: AT A GLANCE: A look at the Ford Ranger.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: THE MECHANIC: As automotive electrical systems become more
complex and computer-dependent, the once relatively simple role of
the battery takes on a whole new dimension. While this unobtrusive
component of the vehicle's electrical network has remained
basically unchanged since its debut, it has earned the dubious
position of being the most overlooked component under the hood.

<P>
   &UR; PERSONAL TECHNOLOGY: AFRICAN-AMERICAN WEB SURFERS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The African-American Web surfer belongs to one of the
fastest-growing user groups on the Internet. By 2003, it's expected
that more than 14 million African-Americans will be on-line.
Blackfamilies.com, which launched Jan. 18, Martin Luther King Day,
is the newest Web site hoping to tap into this growing user group.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TRENDS: Many alternative and mainstream cartoonists are
finding that the Web is a valuable tool for publishing and
promoting their work.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TECH BRIEFS: Surfing the Web is getting to be a little
like living in a glass house_ much of what you do goes noticed.
Those who run Web sites use things called ``cookies'' and
``referrers'' to see what we search for, but a software product
from a Cambridge, Mass., company blocks cookies for you, without
limiting your access to different Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TECH TOOLS: Computer programs and Web sites will provide
you with the correct date and time in any city, as well as the
longitude and latitude in case you are navigating.

<P>
   WITH: TECHNOBUDDY: Don't pay retail for a computer if you can
help it. First, identify the specifications for the machine you
want to buy. Then go shopping.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOOKS: ``ELEGY FOR IRIS'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The well is dry, the brain atrophied. Iris Murdoch, the last of
the great 20th-century British writers, has Alzheimer's. And yet,
in ``Elegy for Iris,'' a beautifully rendered portrait by her
husband, John Bayley, we are allowed to glimpse the private
sanctuary of the artist's once vital mind. We get to peer through
the opaque windows of a marriage that wouldn't seem nearly so
remarkable had it not spawned such a monumental body of work: 26
novels that have the Protean grandeur, the intellectual richness,
the lyrical luster of Shakespeare or Proust.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: REVIEW: In ``American Beach,'' author Russ Rymer is too
intent on academically documenting the disintegration of
African-American businesses to let his characters take charge.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: REVIEW: ``Angels Flight'' may be author Michael Connelly's
darkest novel yet.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: SKUBE ON BOOKS: The biographer, like any artist, must
possess the intuition and moral imagination to breathe life into
his subject.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &UR; SCIENCE &AMP; HEALTH &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In dental chairs, doctors' offices and surgical wards, more
medical professionals are harnessing the power of light and lasers
to diagnose and treat everything from cancer to cavities.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: FOLIC ACID: Women should consume at least 400 micrograms
of folic acid daily. But most women get only half of that amount,
say health specialists.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: HEALTH BRIEFS: After years of holding steady, HIV
infection rates are rising among young gay men in Atlanta, possibly
because of recreational drug abuse, an AIDS advocacy group is

HELPING GREECE CATCH ON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS _ As host of the 2004 Olympics, Greece automatically gets
to enter its baseball team in the competition, without having to
qualify. Which is fine, but Greece doesn't have a baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   Or a baseball stadium. Or a coach. Or bats. Or baseball fans,
for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Red Sox and the Baltimore Orioles are about to change
that.
</P>
<P>
   As a gesture of good will, the teams plan to send several
coaches and players to train Greek players when the 1999 season
ends in the United States. In addition, the Major League Baseball
Commissioner's office has offered to help refurbish several rutted,
rock-strewn baseball fields on an abandoned US military base
outside Athens.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to instill a love of baseball in the cradle of
Western thought. More immediately, everyone wants to form a team
that won't embarrass Greece as it holds the Games for the first
time since it hosted the debut of the modern Olympics in 1896.
</P>
<P>
   The idea came from US Ambassador R. Nicholas Burns, who is, to
put it undiplomatically, a nut about baseball. He may be the only
ambassador anywhere who displays Carl Yastrzemski and Carlton Fisk
baseball cards right by the requisite portraits of President
Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright.
</P>
<P>
   During a conversation last year with officials from Greek's
Ministry of Sports, Burns turned the conversation to baseball, as
he often does.
</P>
<P>
   Burns inquired about the preparations for baseball in 2004. The
government officials conceded that although Greece has
extraordinary soccer and basketball teams, it lacks baseball
players, particularly catchers, pitchers, outfielders, and anyone
who knows what ``batting stance'' means.
</P>
<P>
   Burns sought the assistance of Paul Beeston, president of Major
League Baseball, and Lou Gorman, Red Sox executive consultant and
former general manager. He also called Orioles owner Peter Angelos,
a Greek American. All agreed to contribute money, materials, and
advisers to help with baseball diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   In an oversight, perhaps, the ambassador from Wellesley, Mass.,
neglected to contact George Steinbrenner, the deep-pocketed owner
of the world champion Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe George would have been glad to help,'' Beeston
said last week from New York. ``Maybe the ambassador has too many
bad memories of Red Sox-Yankees games.''
</P>
<P>
   Beeston said baseball management is excited about the chance to
help Europe catch up to the United States, Latin America, and Japan
in baseball fever. The commissioner's office may send coaches and
trainers from minor league teams, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to promote baseball as much as we can,'' said Lou
Gorman, of the Red Sox. ``When it gets spread all over the whole
world, maybe we'll have a real World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns put out the word among Hellenic organizations about the
need for a few good ballplayers with Greek passports. Or, at the
very least, the heritage that would entitle them to play for
Greece.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got people coming out of the woodwork,'' he says as he
sits in his Athens residence, which is decorated with a model of
Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   At first, apparently, Greek officials assumed they would go to
the Major Leagues and recruit Greek-American players like, well,
what's-his-name. But Greek-Americans have not reached the
prominence in professional baseball that they have in politics, the
media, and the arts. The big leagues do not yet have a Michael
Dukakis, or Olympia Snowe, or George Stephanopolous, or Yanni, the
new age musician.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Burns's preliminary scouting report has identified
several up-and-coming Greek-American players on several campuses.
And the volunteers include Charles G. Samiotes and Bill Galatis,
who take part in the Red Sox Fantasy Camp in Fort Myers every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that we are pretty good ball players and would like to
be involved in the 2004 Olympics, as well as bringing baseball to
Greece,'' Samiotes, who is from Wayland, wrote in an e-mail to
Burns.
</P>
<P>
   Costas Bakouris, managing director of Athens 2004, which is
coordinating the Olympics in Greece, has watched with pleasure
while the ambassador works his Rolodex.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a Red Sox fan, you have a special relationship with
the team. . . . I don't know whether the word is fanatic, I don't
know if you're masochistic,'' Bakouris said at Athens 2004 Olympic
headquarters, which has plenty of pictures of swimmers and runners,
but none of outfielders or pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   In the interest of full disclosure, Bakouris mentions that he
went to college in Chicago and is a White Sox fan. ``I actually
like the Cubs, too,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   At the embassy, Burns is busy monitoring violence in the Balkans
and trying to ease tensions between Greece and its enemy Turkey. He
asked an assistant, Dave Simons, who usually oversees housing for
embassy employees, to be his point man on baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Simons, of Salt Lake City, doesn't know how Burns chose him, but
he assumes it has something to do his background as a Red Sox fan.
</P>
<P>
   The Greek government is building baseball and softball stadiums
and practice fields, which should be ready shortly before the
Olympics. That leaves aspiring players _ if any appear _ with no
place to play for the next few seasons. So one of Simons' first
stops was the old Hellinikon Air Base near Athens, which the US Air
Force deserted five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A pessimist would have seen four rusting backstops and rutted
baseball and softball diamonds that have been transformed to a
makeshift soccer field. That's exactly what Simons saw, and he's an
optimist.
</P>
<P>
   The only things holding the backstops together seem to be
weathered signs proclaiming that ``non-appropriated funds''
(donations, in layman's language) were used to build the baseball
emporium on the base.
</P>
<P>
   Still, like anyone who has cheered for the Red Sox at some
point, Simons is a believer. What he saw was not quite a field of
dreams, but a field of weeds with potential. ``It was kind of a
nostalgic experience,'' he says. ``It takes you back to the summers
when you were a kid buying Sno-Kones.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially if you were a kid on a military base blessed with
non-appropriated funds.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox have not decided which players to send over, and the
Orioles say they also will volunteer to help with training in the
off-season. Simons is working with the league management to
refurbish the fields, a project that is expected to start later
this year.
</P>
<P>
   One evening earlier this month, Simons looked out of his
apartment window and saw a sign, a harbinger, a message from
Spalding or Rawlings or Nike, the ancient gods of sport:
</P>
<P>
   In the fading, golden light of dusk, there stood three boys,
about 12 years old, laughing and playing catch with a baseball and
gloves.

THE BEGINNING OF THE ENDGAME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT 
c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - When three members of the House prosecution team
told the media circus gathered around Monica Lewinsky that she
would be a good witness, they undercut their credibility with the
Senate one more time.
</P>
<P>
   Had the House Republican 3 _ Bill McCollum of Florida, Ed Bryant
of Tennessee, and Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas _ had the good sense
to say something neutral, Lewinsky's lawyer, Plato Cacheris, might
have let them off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   But as Cacheris watched them go beyond the facts once more, he
had no choice but to set the record straight. Nothing different
from her 22 previous appearances and sworn statements, Cacheris
said bluntly. There's nothing substantive to add, he said, so
please tell your superiors (a lovely insult) to lay off and let her
have a chance at a life.
</P>
<P>
   It was the beginning of the endgame, and Henry Hyde's minions
had once again stuck their necks out in public with a tale that
could be contradicted simply by the facts.
</P>
<P>
   The Monica incident was not the only one in town that evening.
House managers also spent time with the least credible practitioner
in the political game, former Clinton adviser Dick Morris, as they
attempted to cobble together a list of deposition witnesses that
might have a chance of Senate approval.
</P>
<P>
   In the trial presentations, however, the managers themselves had
already poisoned that well with their most astonishing
prevarication of all.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Bryant had been the offender, and his offense over the
weekend was to twist the facts. Bryant had supplied what appeared
to be a grand jury testimony-based narrative of a phone call
between President Clinton and Morris as the sex scandal was
breaking a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, once the US attorney for western Tennessee, informed the
Senate on Friday that Morris's testimony had been that Clinton told
him he was preparing to hold a press conference trashing Lewinsky
but that Morris had urged caution before taking such a dramatic and
irrevocable step.
</P>
<P>
   And then Bryant sat down at the managers' table, and no one said
a thing.
</P>
<P>
   At the other table, the presidential attorneys could not believe
their ears _ or their luck. The next day, White House counsel
Charles Ruff seized on another version of the ``trashing'' theory
from Representative Jim Rogan of California to pounce.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Bryant's narrative, Ruff simply read from Page 127
of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's referral to the House,
describing Morris's account of his second chat with the president:
</P>
<P>
   ``When Mr. Morris was considering holding a press conference to
`blast Monica Lewinsky out of the water,' the president told Mr.
Morris to `be careful.' According to Mr. Morris, the president
warned him not to be too hard on (Miss Lewinsky).''
</P>
<P>
   ``One hundred eighty degrees off,'' deadpanned Ruff.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast this with Ruff's behavior when he got caught trying to
ignore unpleasant facts in his own presentation on the witness
tampering charge that is part of the obstruction of justice
impeachment article. The White House argument had not dealt either
with a second Clinton-Betty Currie meeting after his deposition in
the Paula Jones case or with the fact Currie had been subpoenaed as
a potential witness in the case after the scandal broke in the
press.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff immediately apologized for his effort to be too cute by
half and thus misleading. That confession, however, then gave him
standing to rebut the material _ noting that after the headlines
the Jones lawyers had in fact issued a blizzard of Lewinsky-related
motions (Currie's subpoena was No. 163) in the closing days of
discovery, and that eight days after the first story, the judge in
the case ruled all Lewinsky material immaterial to it.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the endgame melodrama is dominated by opinion
polls, fatigue, exasperation, scenarios _ in short, by politics.
But beneath the surface is the most important reason of all why
more than a few Republicans have edged toward a willingness to pull
the trial's plug.
</P>
<P>
   It was on vivid display still again last Saturday as Hutchinson
sought to paint presidential friend Vernon Jordan as a crook by
presenting ``evidence'' that Jordan had told the grand jury ``you
didn't have to be an Einstein'' to realize that once Lewinsky was
subpoenaed in the Jones case in mid-December 1997, that his job
search and her effort to avoid telling the truth were related.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton attorney David Kendall noted, this deliberately
misstated Jordan's repeated testimony that the subpoena caused him
to get (false) assurances from Clinton and Lewinsky that they had
no relationship and only then to continue with the job and other
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The problem here is called bad faith, and it has proved fatal to
the House case, as it should.

<TEXT>
<P>
   On Jan. 16, 1995, the University of Connecticut beat Tennessee,
77-66, in a game televised around the country that gave the Huskies
their first No. 1 ranking and catapulted them toward an undefeated
season and the national championship. Although UConn had been good
for years, that one victory is often cited as putting the women's
basketball program on the map.
</P>
<P>
   Time will tell whether Boston College's 78-66 upset of those
Huskies last Saturday becomes the same kind of defining moment, but
this much is certain: On Sunday morning, a lot more people were
paying attention than had been 24 hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two people sent flowers today, fans calling, people I don't
even know leaving messages on the machine,'' said Eagles coach
Cathy Inglese Monday. ``It's been overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   When you look back over the past few seasons, the shocker over
UConn shocks a little less. In 1994-95 _ the year UConn went 35-0
in Geno Auriemma's 10th season at the helm _ Inglese was in her
second year at The Heights, and her team was 6-21. Since then, the
Eagles have finished 10-17, 18-10, and 17-11. Early last season
they easily handled Texas Tech, 82-68, when it was ranked No. 25,
and beat Notre Dame, 78-76, before the Irish went on to the Sweet
Sixteen.
</P>
<P>
   This season, they again beat Notre Dame, which was No. 7 at the
time, and the next week the Eagles made their first-ever appearance
in the national polls at No. 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each year's been a steppingstone to get here,'' said Inglese,
whose team was No. 22 in the Associated Press poll that came out
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But beating No. 2 UConn, to which it had lost 16 straight games
going back to 1990, is more like a battering ram.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to open more doors for us,'' deadpanned
Inglese.
</P>
<P>
   Behind some of those doors will be media: ABC didn't even wait
for the end of the game before calling to put in dibs for an
interview with the soon-to-be victorious coach. And when's the last
time the BC women's basketball team took up two-thirds of the
Sunday Globe's sports front?
</P>
<P>
   Behind others will be fans, their interest finally piqued.
Monday, the BC ticket office got 30 orders for advance tickets,
which, said associate athletic director Jim O'Neill, was ``very
unusual for us. Outside of UConn, we'd be lucky to get a call a
week for advance tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Eagles have played most of their games at Conte
Forum in front of crowds not even a 10th the size of Saturday's
8,606.
</P>
<P>
   Behind still more will be recruits, newly impressed by all of
the above.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you a great phone call,'' said Mike Flynn, editor of
the Blue Star Report, a newsletter on recruiting. ``It helps you
with your mailing. It makes a statement to recruits. Maybe this
changes who they feel they can target. This gives BC the chance to
rise above the pack.''
</P>
<P>
   And with the game televised on Fox Sports New England and
selectively picked up around the country as the upset was brewing,
a lot of folks got their first glimpse of BC women's basketball on
a day when Conte Forum was filled to capacity and Alissa Murphy
played like Chamique Holdsclaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't ask for a better scenario,'' said Muffet McGraw,
coach of Notre Dame. ``All the recruits are watching. It sort of
legitimizes your program. As a coach, you're always saying, `We're
pretty good, come watch us.' This turns it from opinion to fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Because next year's freshman class is virtually set by now, any
long-term impact of the win won't be seen for a couple of years,
and even that isn't guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going on a losing streak and not making the NCAA tournament,
that would basically negate the effect of this game,'' warned
Flynn.
</P>
<P>
   Inglese pretty much agreed: ``If we make it to the NCAAs'' _
which BC has never done _ ``that's the step we need to get some of
those bigger players, not just one a year but maybe two or three a
year.''
</P>
<P>
   But that madness comes in March. For now, it's well-earned
hysteria at The Heights.

SUPER BOWL TEAMS IGNORE THE ODDSMAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The Denver Broncos know what it's like to be the Atlanta
Falcons this week. They know what it means to have no chance in the
biggest football game of the year.
</P>
<P>
   They know it means nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene Robinson knows what it's like to be the Denver Broncos
this week. He knows what it means to be told there is no way you
can lose the biggest football game of the year.
</P>
<P>
   He knows it means nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Broncos' team and the Falcons' safety know because just
12 months ago one was the team that had no chance to win and the
other played for the team that had no chance to lose. The Broncos
were believed to be the Denver Lambs then, a team sent to the
slaughter at Super Bowl XXXII at the hands of Robinson's mighty
Green Bay Packers. As 12-point underdogs, the Lambs were there
only, it was said, because Green Bay needed somebody to beat up on
and the Broncos had volunteered.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve months later, those same Broncos are back as defending
Super Bowl champions, conquerers of Robinson's Packers, and now
favorites themselves to do to Robinson's Falcons what Green Bay
could not do to them.
</P>
<P>
   Oddsmakers did not build Las Vegas out of desert sands by being
wrong very often about such matters, but no one is right all the
time, either, so as the madness of Super Bowl week began, that gave
hope to one team and served as cautionary note to the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one expects us to go out there and win,'' Robinson said of
his 16-2 Falcons. ``I'm pretty sure Denver is feeling pretty good
about themselves because they played marvelously throughout the
season. Some people expected them to finish 17-0, and that was
within their grasp. They're a great team.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't mind being the underdog. Being an underdog is
being in a position to surprise the other team. I like that.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't like it much last year, though, when his was the team
that was surprised. He didn't like it when the Broncos came out and
ran the ball on his defense until they had beaten it into
submission. He didn't much like learning that underdogs have teeth,
too, but a year later it is a lesson he can pass on to his
less-experienced teammates. A lesson about life and about football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wore my Super Bowl ring (from Super Bowl XXXI) leading into
the NFC Championship in Minnesota because I wanted to make it
tangible for the other guys here,'' Robinson said. ``A lot of guys
look at the ring and want to put it on and look at it up close, but
I tell them we can all have our own rings. We can do this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to make it real for them. Don't be mesmerized by the
Super Bowl. We can go out there and win a football game and get our
own rings. People said we had an advantage last year because the
Packers had been there the year before. People said the same thing
about the 49ers when we were getting ready for the divisional
playoffs a couple of weeks ago because they had more experience
than we did. Quite frankly, our guys don't care at all about that.
We've been accustomed to winning all season long. The theme all
year has been to win a game every week.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there is only one week _ and one game _ left, and though
Robinson's team is not expected to win, he knows it can. He knows
this not solely because he believes in the Falcons. He knows this
not solely because it was in this same city 30 years ago that the
New York Jets pulled off one of the biggest upsets in football
history.
</P>
<P>
   No, Robinson knows this because he has first-hand evidence that
is just 12 months old. It is the same evidence the Broncos believe
will insulate them from the arrogance they feel led to the Packers'
downfall a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta pretty much comes into the situation we came in last
year _ the underdog,'' said Broncos All-Pro tight end Shannon
Sharpe. ``I don't know how many people are giving them a chance but
I think we learned from the mistakes that Green Bay made. You have
to respect your opponent and you have to prepare. If you do that,
you at least give yourself an opportunity to win the ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get those 11 1/2-12 points (from the spread) on the
scoreboard. For us, 7 points doesn't mean anything because we know
that we have to go out there and play the ballgame. I think we
learned a valuable lesson in how Green Bay approached it.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question we respect them more than Green Bay respected us.
No one gave Atlanta a chance to go into Minnesota and beat that
team, and they did. We've got our hands full. We know that.''
</P>
<P>
   They know it now, but will they remember it Wednesday and
Thursday and Friday and Saturday and most of all Sunday? Will they
know it after a week of hearing and reading about how great they
are and how this is a bon voyage party for John Elway and a
showcase for the league's fourth 2,000-yard rusher, Terrell Davis?
</P>
<P>
   Will they still know it when they have been told over and over
about the sad history of the Falcons, who never have been even
close to a Super Bowl before?
</P>
<P>
   Will they still know it enough to think of Aretha Franklin when
they think of the Falcons and give them R-E-S-P-E-C-T and remember
to T-C-B or will they just think, as Aretha used to wail, that
they're going to ``sock it to 'em, sock it to 'em, sock it to 'em,
sock it to 'em YEAH just a little bit?''
</P>
<P>
   Until the game is played nobody can know that for sure, but
Broncos cornerback Ray Crockett believes if his team has a problem
come Sunday, it won't be because they didn't see it coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really worry about being the underdog or being picked
to win,'' Crockett said. ``That really doesn't matter to us. What
we have to do is go out and prepare the same way we did last year.
Last year we didn't feel like the underdogs. We thought we were
definitely as talented as any team out there and we feel the same
way about Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't look at them as an underdog. They have as much talent
as anyone. We're all here with an even battle. There are no
underdogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Not in this game there aren't. In this game there are only two
teams, both survivors of a long walk through minefields. They are
the champions and the future champions. If the Denver Broncos
intend to become both, they need to remember Ray Crockett's words
because you can bet on one thing this week for sure. Eugene
Robinson will.

MEET FAST EDDIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; They are the most arresting commercials on television.
Desperate barkers hawk financial products along a darkened carnival
midway in a skyscraper canyon. A frog hops among the flotsam in a
flooded hall, seeking to avoid the alligators and sharks. One
astonishing image after another fills the screen, emphasizing the
ubiquity of fragility and deception in the financial world. ``This
is a world few know well,'' intones the announcer. Finally the
camera pans up to disclose a serene glass and steel presence far
above the turmoil. ``Come to the mountain called First Union,'' the
announcer continues. ``Or, if you prefer, the mountain will come to
you.''
</P>
<P>
   First Union Corp. says it has been around for 92 years. Why
haven't we heard of it before?
</P>
<P>
   Meet Edward E. Crutchfield, 57, known as ``Fast Eddie'' in the
banking community for the alactrity of his deals. A dozen years ago
he was the newly named chief executive of the third biggest bank in
North Carolina, after North Carolina National Bank and Wachovia
Bank. Today, he runs the sixth largest bank in America _ though
still only second biggest in Charlotte. Wachovia threw in with
First Atlanta shortly after a 1985 Supreme Court decision that
permitted banks to expand regionally, but NCNB changed its name to
NationsBank and went on a buying spree. Today it is the nation's
third largest bank, after Citibank and Chase. Hugh McColl built
NationsBank by buying distressed banks at sale prices. Crutchfield
built First Union through a whirlwind series of premium-priced
deals. (He's pledged, more than once, to seek a less dilutive
``merger of equals'' next time.) NationsBank went south and west
and the middle of the country. First Union went up the Eastern
seaboard _ from Florida to Connecticut, so far. In fact, the
present-day incarnation of First Union in the television
commercials is barely four years old. That was when, in a meeting
at the Greenbriar resort in West Virginia, Crutchfield and his
fellow executives decided to take on the mutual funds and brokerage
companies head to head. They bought Boston's Keystone Investments
Inc., a large manager of stock, bond, and money market funds, in
September 1996. ``We're trying to build a business that is about 50
percent traditional bank while the other needs to look like a
combination of Merrill Lynch, Fidelity, and Charles Schwab,''
Crutchfield told an interviewer in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   One tactic in the expansion drive is a single bankwide computer
system that is supposed to give First Union insurmountable
economies of scale; another is an aggressive customer friendliness
that sends ``calling officers'' into homes earning as little as
$75,000 annually, in a search for business beyond traditional bank
ing fees. (That's how the mountain comes to you.) The surreal
television advertising campaign is the brainchild of Crutchfield
and advertising legend Hal Riney, chairman of a San Francisco
agency. The idea was to somehow ``break above the clutter'' of
ordinary ads for financial services. Riney is best remembered for a
series of commercials for Bartles and Jaymes wine coolers (and
Ronald Reagan's ``Morning in America'' ad!). He enlisted Industrial
Light and Magic, the Hollywood spe cialeffects firm (it grew out of
the ``Star Wars'' films) to make his commercials. Four have aired
so far; a fifth is scheduled to be shown for the first time during
Sunday's Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In the advertising community, a spirited debate is underway
about the efficacy of the ads; there is always disagreement when an
image campaign is not tied directly to the product. But the more
interesting question has to do with whether it is possible to
establish a brand without a secure position in the marketplace.
That's the real riddle at the heart of First Union's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   With the financial services industry poised for another great
wave of consolidation, First Union's strategy in the capital
markets, like that of other banks, must be one of keep ing its
stock price high _ all the while aggressively searching for
acquisitions among the remaining premium independent regional banks
_ Fleet Financial, for example, or BankBoston. That means behaving
more than a little like those carnival barkers and alligators in
its ads. It remains to be seen whether you can befriend the world's
frogs _ and eat them too.

   Food and dining stories from The N.Y. Times News Service for
Wednesday, Jan. 28:
</P>
<P>
   NAPA-BRANDY (Undated) _ The Napa Valley is fairly popping with
vineyards. On weekends, it turns into a playpen for yuppies. But
there is one intriguing wine-related activity that remains in its
infancy, little noticed by the thundering herds, in the Napa Valley
or elsewhere in California: distilling. Exactly five tenacious
enterprises in this state are engaged in the exacting business of
producing brandies or eaux-de-vies by traditional Continental
methods. All of them turn out products that can stand comparison
with their counterparts in Europe, where the custom of drinking a
digestif _ a small glass of dry spirits after dinner, perhaps with
a coffee and a cigar _ is far better established than in the United
States. By R.W. Apple Jr.
</P>
<P>
   With recipes.
</P>
<P>
   MANDOLINE (Undated) _ It appears to be a simple sweet potato
gratin, a tall square stack, browned on top and sagging on the
edges. As you sink your fork into it, though, it reveals layer upon
fine layer, like a piece of puff pastry. Most chefs can dazzle home
cooks with their knife skills, but even they cannot exact such
precision on sweet potatoes and apples unaided. Their secret, the
tool that no chef would live without, is the mandoline. And this
slicing tool is perfectly suited to home cooking. By Amanda Hesser.

   IMPEACHMENT TRIAL
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH _ WASHINGTON _ The Senate is to convene at noon EST
today and move to the impeachment trial of President Clinton. The
White House lawyers and House prosecutors each have two hours to
argue the case for calling witnesses to the trial. The senators are
then expected to move into a closed-door session to debate whether
the House prosecutors will be allowed to subpoena witnesses. Next
on the schedule is two votes: the vote on a motion to dismiss the
case offered by Sen. Robert Byrd, and the vote on calling
witnesses. These votes are likely to be held over until Wednesday.

<P>
   COX-AFFIRMATIVE _ WASHINGTON - The Center for Individual Rights,
which successfully fought affirmative action in education in Texas,
unveiled a new legal strategy Tuesday - a threat to seek personal
damages from trustees of public universities that use racial
preferences in admissions. ``Trustees are going to have to step up
to the plate,'' said CIR's senior counsel, Terence J. Pell.
(Shepard, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   BLUE-DOGS _ WASHINGTON _ The ``Blue Dogs'' or conservative
Democrats have increased in number and in clout in Congress. As a
result, unity in the Democratic party could depend greatly on
bringing together these younger conservatives with their
traditionally liberal collegues. Moderate Waco democrat Chet
Edwards realized this a while back. ``We were a disfunctional
family in 1994,'' he said. Now, Edwards has become a bridge between
conservatives and the Democratic leadership. He says conservative
Democrats are bringing the party back ``to the middle of the road''
and will be the key in regaining Democratic control of Congress in
2000. (Moscoso, Cox News Service).

place conservative job seekers in suitable positions'' at no
charge. (Harmon, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.

   TEXAS-PATROL _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Matthew MacMorran was struggling
with an uncooperative lug nut on the right-front wheel of his Ford
pickup when Bruce Murphy pulled up behind him in the inside
breakdown lane of MoPac Boulevard. MacMorran had been trying to
avoid being hit by cars that whizzed by only feet away as he tried
to change a flat tire in the middle of heavy traffic. Even after
police officer Bruce Spence closed off the nearest lane of traffic,
the work was still taking time and slowing traffic. Frustrated
drivers had begun honking their horns. When Murphy offered to help,
MacMorran gladly wiped his tire-greased hands and watched as Murphy
finished the job in less than 10 minutes with an air gun. MacMorran
didn't know who Murphy was or why he was helping, but it turns out
the help didn't come from the average good Samaritan. Murphy's job
is to roam area highways and help stranded motorists. ``I never
knew they had this courtesy patrol thing,'' MacMorran said after
thanking Murphy. ``I know I would have been out here a lot longer
if he hadn't come along.'' Spence was also grateful Murphy came
along. ``It's definitely a whole lot simpler when you've got the
right tools,'' Spence said. ``A lot of times (the courtesy patrol)
can get things moving a whole lot faster.'' That's the idea behind
the state Transportation Department's 2-year-old program. (Hiott,

   SPIELBERG-HOLOCAUST _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Palm Beach County
high school students will be the first in the country to get their
Holocaust lessons courtesy of Steven Spielberg and have their
teachers trained by the former director of the research institute
of the Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C. Spielberg's Shoah
Visual History Foundation, based in Los Angeles, has spent three
years documenting the stories of 50,000 Holocaust survivors,
including 289 in Palm Beach, Martin, St. Lucie and Indian River
counties in Florida. In March, three teachers from each high school
in the county will gather to learn how to incorporate an
educational CD-ROM produced by Spielberg into their lesson plans.
Their teacher will be Michael Berenbaum, president of Shoah and the
former director of the Holocaust Research Institute of the U.S.
Holocaust Museum. (Isger, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   WINTER-FARMING _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Cows aren't any better at
walking on a sheet of ice than people, which is why farmer Clyde
Musser cringed every time he checked on his cattle during the
winter storms this month. ``The barnyard was covered with ice and
the cows were sliding around like they were wearing roller
skates,'' he said. ``It hasn't been a very healthy situation.''
Musser's 30 cows are important to his livelihood, and caring for
them through the extremes of winter is hard work. Jeff Layman, Ohio
State extension agent for agriculture in Miami County, said winter
months present several challenges for farmers. ``The ups and downs
of winter cause a lot of problems _ whether it's keeping animals
healthy, making sure water supplies don't freeze, watching for
moisture in grain storage or even just starting a diesel engine,''
Layman said. (Elliott, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.

businesses out of Times Square. Mayor Mike Turner hailed the

<P>
   In rapturous waves, they stand and cheer, their ecstatic smiles
as wide and lingering as his, their eyes as joyful. What does it
matter that Bill Clinton is on trial for perjury and obstruction of
justice? Look at his supporters _ at his fans. He is a president at
the peak of his popularity.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 19 the president delivered his State-of-the-Union
message to Congress. He described a country in its best shape in
years, where almost every indicator ticks towards improvement.
</P>
<P>
   America is in its eighth year of economic boom. Both federal and
state budgets are in surplus, even awash with money. The
unemployment rate, at 4.3 percent, is the lowest for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   In the big cities, murder rates have fallen by a fifth; the
crack epidemic has faded; even abortion rates and rates of teenage
pregnancy are falling. Gasoline is as cheap as it was between the
world wars, and baseball home runs at their highest ever.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder, you might conclude, that Clinton's popularity
knows no bounds. According to the latest USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll,
81 percent of the public now judge his presidency a success, and 69
percent approve of his overall job performance.
</P>
<P>
   And yet these figures and are also surreal and bizarre. Before
they dutifully trooped over to the House of Representatives to hear
the president's speech, the senators had been engaged in quite
other business: sitting as a silent jury to consider whether
Clinton should be removed from office. And, the next day, they
returned there.
</P>
<P>
   Small forests have been felled in the effort to explain why,
despite the disgrace of impeachment, the president's party and the
public still cling to him with such devotion.
</P>
<P>
   It is as though the president's supporters and his attackers are
moving in different worlds. But they are not. Both sides are
enjoying the extraordinary good times, and both sides are well
aware that they have been comprehensively lied to by this
president.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the loyalty are complicated. And though some of
them are justified, they are mainly rooted in a mixture of
opportunism and delusion.
</P>
<P>
   Take the Democrats first. On Tuesday, they roared their
appreciation of Clinton. And, looking back some years, the party
owes a lot to him. He united its warring factions under a centrist
banner, allied the party to alien concepts of fiscal probity and
free trade, and won two elections on the strength of it.
</P>
<P>
   The modern Democrats are his party; they have no one else
approaching his political talent, and few who can match his
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, in August, the picture was very different. Then,
after the president's televised non-apology about his conduct in
the Monica Lewinsky case, party members were moving fast away from
him.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Joseph Lieberman, in a speech that summed up the mood of
the party, called Clinton's actions ``wrong and unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   So what has changed now? Not the president's offenses; Democrats
still admit that these cannot be defended. Not the sense of
betrayal; colleagues once lied to will always have been lied to.
</P>
<P>
   What has changed is the political calculation. November's
midterm elections, in which the Democrats astonishingly won seats
in the House, showed that Clinton was not, in fact, a political
liability. And the spiteful, even unethical, handling of the
impeachment proceedings by the House Republicans rallied the
Democrats behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Without the rotten behavior of the president's enemies, it is a
reasonable bet that his party would not be displaying such loyalty
towards him. And if the conduct of the trial, against expectation,
becomes more neutral rather than more partisan, some of that
wafer-thin fidelity may begin to tear.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are also aware that, by supporting the president, they
are reflecting the public mood. The American people have been
unwavering: all year, by two-thirds majorities, they have wanted to
keep this president in office. They approve of the job he is doing.
</P>
<P>
   For as long as it has existed, the job-performance poll has
always been linked to the state of the economy. Inevitably, when
people feel prosperous, they feel happy with the man who presides
over that prosperity; they do not want to rock the boat by
replacing him.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this loyalty, too, has its threadbare side. Most Americans
are shrewd enough to know that economic prosperity is not something
presidents bring. It is caused by cyclical factors, by the ups and
downs of trading partners, by careful tinkering at the Federal
Reserve; even Clinton's commitment to balanced budgets, while
useful, is small beer.
</P>
<P>
   He is, above all, a manager; and the disappearance of one
manager, and his replacement by another, need not be so traumatic.
But what the public seems to imagine it will lose if Clinton goes
is more complex, and more peculiar, than that.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's great strengths when he arrived in office were his
energy and his empathy. His energy is flagging now, but his ability
to connect with the common man remains as impressive as ever.
</P>
<P>
   He has never placed himself on a pedestal before Americans: he
is one of them. Therefore, when he cheats and lies, he is also one
of them: flawed, human, fallible. Therefore, when his critics
attack him for actual crimes, they are being moralistic and
sanctimonious.
</P>
<P>
   When those critics then display partisan animus against him,
Clinton becomes the underdog who wins the public's sympathy for the
simple reason that he keeps on fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this sympathy, like the loyalty of his own party, does not
run deep. When people were asked, in that same USA Today poll,
whether they thought him honest, 76 percent said no. His contempt
for the law has been noted.
</P>
<P>
   Of course he is only human, only a manager; in prosperous and
peaceful times, people demand little more of their president.
Perhaps his critics should leave him alone.
</P>
<P>
   But another argument seems just as pertinent: if this man is so
ordinary, so willfully untouched by the duties and dignity of his
office, there seems no reason why Americans should be so keen to
keep him. &QL;

<P>
   Another massacre, more denials and dissemblings, the usual
pitiful survivors' tales. This time it was 45 ethnic Albanians,
including old men and children, who had been shot dead, probably at
close range.
</P>
<P>
   The only new twist was the Serbian authorities' behavior after
the killings _ the expulsion of a senior international monitor, and
the spiriting away of the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   This was outrageous even by the standards of the region, and the
world is justified in holding Yugoslavia's President Slobodan
Milosevic responsible. So is it time for NATO's long-threatened air
strikes against the Serbs?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the ``verifiers'' of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe have reported strong prima facie evidence
that the killings were carried out in cold blood by Serbs, probably
in uniform. (They had blamed many previous cease-fire violations on
ethnic Albanians.)
</P>
<P>
   And certainly NATO would make a fool of itself if Milosevic
refused to abide by last October's cease-fire agreement and the
alliance then failed to carry out its threat to bomb Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   If air strikes become the only way of averting a catastrophic
loss of western moral authority, they will have to be carried out.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, however, a bombing campaign would not in itself
be enough to meet all the challenges posed by Serb brutishness _
and the killings, kidnappings and intimidation by ethnic-Albanian
fighters _ in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   For a start, one consequence could be more deaths of old people
and children. Among the risks of a bombing campaign is that it
would trigger bloody fighting in Pristina, Kosovo's capital.
</P>
<P>
   If the western world crosses that Rubicon, and conducts an air
campaign against a sovereign country of nearly 11 million people,
it will have to acknowledge, more clearly than hitherto, its
responsibility for the future of the rump Yugoslav state,
consisting of Serbia (including Kosovo) and Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   This would mean not only deploying armed peacekeepers to police
whatever cease-fire agreement were eventually reached, but setting
out an internationally agreed formula for the political future of
the federation and then putting intense pressure on the parties to
accept it.
</P>
<P>
   That should be done in any event, even if Milosevic backs down
this time and a bombing campaign is averted. Recent diplomatic
efforts have shown that there is virtually no chance of Serbs and
Albanians freely reaching agreement by themselves.
</P>
<P>
   What should that internationally agreed formula be? It will
somehow have to accommodate two principles. The first is that nasty
microbes fester whenever large numbers of people are subjected to
rule they regard as illegitimate, alien and intolerable.
</P>
<P>
   One of the worst effects is the spawning of insurgencies in
which thugs terrorize their own communities and dabble heavily in
crime, as well as harassing the hated rulers.
</P>
<P>
   The other principle is that, especially after the 1975 Helsinki
agreement, sovereign states should not be broken up by force, even
when (as in Bosnia) many citizens have voted for parties committed
to terminating the state's existence.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing to prevent states breaking up by consensus, as
Czechoslovakia did in 1993, and that may eventually happen in
Yugoslavia. But to countenance the violent, non-consensual breakup
of Serbia would be to invite a similar fate for Macedonia, Albania,
Bosnia, possibly even Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   How can those two principles be reconciled? First, by calling
immediately and unequivocally for the elevation of Kosovo to the
status of the third republic, coequal with Serbia and Montenegro,
in the Yugoslav federation.
</P>
<P>
   Then by offering international guarantees and, if necessary,
peacekeepers to protect enclaves in Kosovo that are either heavily
populated by Serbs (in the north, for example) or regarded as Serb
holy places.
</P>
<P>
   That would give the lie to the Serb nationalists' belief that
the outside world has some racist bias against them, and establish
the principle that Serbs do not need to commit massacres to protect
their people or their heritage. &QL;

<P>
   Another massacre, more denials and dissemblings, the usual
pitiful survivors' tales. This time it was 45 ethnic Albanians,
including old men and children, who had been shot dead, probably at
close range.
</P>
<P>
   The only new twist was the Serbian authorities' behavior after
the killings _ the expulsion of a senior international monitor, and
the spiriting away of the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   This was outrageous even by the standards of the region, and the
world is justified in holding Yugoslavia's President Slobodan
Milosevic responsible. So is it time for NATO's long-threatened air
strikes against the Serbs?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the ``verifiers'' of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe have reported strong prima facie evidence
that the killings were carried out in cold blood by Serbs, probably
in uniform. (They had blamed many previous cease-fire violations on
ethnic Albanians.)
</P>
<P>
   And certainly NATO would make a fool of itself if Milosevic
refused to abide by last October's cease-fire agreement and the
alliance then failed to carry out its threat to bomb Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   If air strikes become the only way of averting a catastrophic
loss of western moral authority, they will have to be carried out.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, however, a bombing campaign would not in itself
be enough to meet all the challenges posed by Serb brutishness _
and the killings, kidnappings and intimidation by ethnic-Albanian
fighters _ in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   For a start, one consequence could be more deaths of old people
and children. Among the risks of a bombing campaign is that it
would trigger bloody fighting in Pristina, Kosovo's capital.
</P>
<P>
   If the western world crosses that Rubicon, and conducts an air
campaign against a sovereign country of nearly 11 million people,
it will have to acknowledge, more clearly than hitherto, its
responsibility for the future of the rump Yugoslav state,
consisting of Serbia (including Kosovo) and Montenegro.

   ``He's just stepped away from his desk.'' The age-old
secretarial excuse for absent bosses depends for its shred of
credibility on a dying technology: the wired telephone.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt secretaries will continue to offer it. But the
mind-boggling price that the markets are putting on the new
Vodafone/AirTouch combination _ their capitalizations will create
the world's ninth-largest telecoms business _ is the clearest
signal yet of a switch of telecoms from land to air.
</P>
<P>
   The new Vodafone is worth three times as much as Yahoo!, that
darling of the Internet share bubble. Mobile telephones have
changed the lives of many more people than the much-hyped Internet
_ and equally radically.
</P>
<P>
   Stupendous as the growth of the Internet has been, it remains
mainly an American phenomenon. The United States accounts for more
than 90 percent of the most-visited Internet sites and about half
of all users.
</P>
<P>
   The boom in the mobile phone has been more of a European and
Asian phenomenon. American companies have been slow to sell digital
phones; slow to charge the caller, rather than the recipient of the
call; and slow to develop a single national network.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile in Europe, mobile phones have been an island of
deregulation amid a sea of old monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   A common digital standard (its replacement is a bone of
contention between Europe and America) allows users to call home
from Shanghai and Sydney to Reykjavik and Rimini. Little surprise
that Europe is home to two of the world's biggest mobile-phone
makers _ and now to its largest mobile-communications firm.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, analysts are still struggling to explain where
the profits will come from. No need for that with mobile
telephones.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two years, more than half of new telephone
subscriptions have been to mobile phones. In Finland, indeed, 53
percent of all telephones are mobile.
</P>
<P>
   Youngsters, off to university or to a new apartment, see no
point in paying for a fixed line when their lives are mobile _ and
the habit, once learned, will stay.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet and data transmission may prolong the life of fixed
lines. But the future of talk will be mobile.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, new mobile markets are still emerging. The latest,
flourishing in Europe more than in America, is for prepaid
mobile-telephones, which now account for 80 percent of new sales
for some firms.
</P>
<P>
   Talk has become like chocolate: you can buy it in the
supermarket or give it (in rationed quantities) to your children,
and companies can offer it free with their products.
</P>
<P>
   Governments, still fixated by the goal of universal service,
have hardly begun to consider the implications of a world in which
telephone time is bought over the counter.
</P>
<P>
   Other innovations will follow. Wireless allows many products,
from cars to tamagotchi, to incorporate communications as
inconspicuously as they already do computer chips.
</P>
<P>
   But already, the growth of wireless is changing the way people
think about the telephone. For one thing, the mobile telephone is a
personal instrument, not a communal one.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the car freed people from the inconvenience of communal
transport, so the mobile is a liberation. That appeals especially
to the young. A mobile-telephone number is a piece of data about a
person, not a household.
</P>
<P>
   Its enormous value is something that _ for all the blather about
Internet ``portals'' _ telephone companies have barely started to
consider.
</P>
<P>
   Equally, wireless will change the significance of location.
Time-zone and cost now matter more than mere distance. Indeed, in
some ways, the mobile telephone dispenses with physical geography
even more effectively than does the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   To tap into their e-mail, most folk still have to plug in
somewhere in the world (although that too will change as new mobile
gadgets develop). But to take that call, they can be anywhere the
signal reaches. Including away from their desk. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   At the start of the decade, with communism vanquished and
socialism reeling from a crushing sideways blow, it was tempting to
write off the left in Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The right was triumphantly entrenched in government in Germany
and Britain and, by 1993, in France, the other big European power,
too. Defeat for the right looked about as likely as the birth of a
single European currency.
</P>
<P>
   How times have changed. These days, European voters have almost
universally rejected parties of the right, turning instead to the
reinvigorated, reinvented left _ and not only in Germany, Britain
and France.
</P>
<P>
   Today in the EU, the right rules alone only in Spain (and, in a
special form, in Ireland).
</P>
<P>
   Across the Union, parties of the right look demoralized, divided
and lost.
</P>
<P>
   In scrambling about for a way out of the electoral wilderness,
one route has begun to catch the eye of the right: nationalism.
This direction may offer some promising ideas. It certainly
presents some grave dangers.
</P>
<P>
   The revival of a nationalist program for the right has its
temptations. Parties of the right in opposition face a basic
choice: whether to try to seize back the center ground that they
have ceded to the new left, or to look for a clear, bold message
that sets them quite apart.
</P>
<P>
   A nationalist message offers just such a distinction. It chimes
with popular insecurities about globalization. And it is all the
more compelling these days in the face of intensifying efforts at
European unification.
</P>
<P>
   Since the launch of Europe's single currency on Jan. 1, if not
before, it has become plain that EU leaders are pressing ahead with
political integration.
</P>
<P>
   Although some Europeans, notably Italians, may be quite pleased
by the prospect of being increasingly governed by foreigners, the
thought sends a shiver down the spine of others. In any event,
plans for European integration in the coming years will challenge
national sovereignty still further.
</P>
<P>
   Right or wrong, there is a respectable case against European
integration to be made, one that resonates with worries about
national identity. This is the case that William Hague, leader of
Britain's Conservative Party, drew on when he outlined on Jan. 19
his ``British Way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Transferring power from Westminster to Brussels,'' among other
pieces of ``constitutional vandalism,'' he declared, ``strikes at
the core of our national identity.''
</P>
<P>
   When, the previous day, France had ratified the Amsterdam
treaty, which pulls the European Union a bit closer together, a
less sophisticated version of the message had been thundered out by
Charles Pasqua, once a French right-wing interior minister: this
week's ratification, he recalled, symbolically took place on the
anniversary of the proclamation of the German empire in 1871.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so (reasonably) respectable. But flirting with
nationalism can be a dangerous game. It can encourage the sorts of
populist fears that give rise to a far more frightening variety:
the xenophobia of the extreme right.
</P>
<P>
   It would be absurd to suggest that all politicians who draw on
nationalist feeling to criticize European integration pander, by
definition, to racists. Most do not.
</P>
<P>
   But the danger nonetheless exists that by fanning the
nationalist fire, even with genuine concerns about, say, an influx
of job-seekers from Eastern Europe in an expanded EU, nationalists
stoke up the sort of populist xenophobia on which the far right
thrives.
</P>
<P>
   This is why it was worrying to see members of Germany's
center-right Christian Democratic Union, which held power in Bonn
for 16 years until last September, take to the streets this week.
</P>
<P>
   They, and their more right-wing Bavarian counterparts in the
Christian Social Union, were doing so to gather signatures for a
petition against proposed changes in Germany's nationality laws.
The new government wants to make it easier for foreigners, notably
Turks, born and brought up in Germany to get a German passport.
</P>
<P>
   The critics, uneasy about this, object in particular to plans to
allow dual citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   It may be that, up to a point, stern words from the moderate
right about racial issues and immigration can steal the thunder of
the far right.
</P>
<P>
   One reason, other than its first-past-the-post voting system,
that Britain has been spared the growth of an extreme-right party
is that the Conservative Party extends farther to the right than
most of its continental counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   If it panders to the fears that the far right plays upon,
however, the moderate right will lend these fears respectability.
It may encourage the xenophobes who attack black and brown
Europeans. And it will discredit itself in the eyes of decent
voters who want nothing to do with racist bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   Which way to deal with anti-immigrant prejudice is the choice
that the French right now faces, thanks to a split in the National
Front, France's nasty far-right party.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend one of the Front's two camps meets to decide its
future. Although many center-right French politicians refuse even
to dignify the Front with the term ``political party,'' there will
be others who see in its implosion a chance to mop up some of its
vote.
</P>
<P>
   The right has been battered across the European Union in recent
years, defeated and outflanked by the new left. It is desperate for
a program around which it could return to power.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is a respectable nationalist agenda, the right
would be wise to pay close attention to the difference between that
and the xenophobic brand. It plays unthinkingly with nationalism at
its peril. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, TEXAS _ The band played ``The Eyes of Texas are Upon
You,'' yet nobody who attended George W. Bush's second inauguration
as governor on Jan. 19 could pretend that only Texas was watching.
</P>
<P>
   Mixed in with a day full of speeches, parades and thousands of
pounds of roasted meat was a buzz of excitement about the future of
Bush, who currently enjoys state approval ratings eclipsing 80
percent and yet, for now, is keeping his presidential aspirations
secret.
</P>
<P>
   With the Bush clan assembled on the platform, Bush used his
inaugural address to build on the idea of ``compassionate
conservatism'' which he introduced on election night last November.
</P>
<P>
   It was a clear attempt both to distance himself from the actions
of his Republican counterparts in Washington and to broaden the
appeal of his party. Bush spoke (in both English and Spanish) of
rallying ``the armies of compassion'' to give hope to all segments
of society.
</P>
<P>
   Extolling the virtues of economic progress, free markets and
free trade, the governor also issued a warning against putting too
much faith in material comforts at the expense of sacrificing
society's moral and spiritual core.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has the next 140 days, the length of the Texas legislative
session, to prove that he can make good on these cloudy maxims and
keep some of the policy promises he made during the governor's
race.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of his agenda are plans to cut property taxes and end
``social promotion'' in public schools, whereby students move on to
higher grades without meeting basic standards.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Texas Education Agency, although over 40,000
children aged nine or ten failed the state's standardized reading
test during the 1996-97 school year, all but 4,400 of them were
promoted to the next grade.
</P>
<P>
   The governor says he is also willing to support school vouchers,
a more controversial scheme both locally and nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Happily for Bush, Republicans dominate Texas for the first time
since the Civil War. With a majority in the state senate and, in
Rick Perry, the first Republican lieutenant-governor in Texan
history, the party is well-set to push its agenda through.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats, too, have become vocal supporters of Bush,
making it more difficult for a unified Democratic opposition to
block the governor's proposals.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush successfully navigates the legislative mine fields over
the coming months, while at the same time defining his political
philosophy for a national audience, he could then activate his
already formidable network of supporters and financial backers.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire (still, despite the maneuvers of bigger states,
the starting-point for any presidential campaign) he has a large
group of loyalists simply waiting for his word to start mobilizing.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, in a letter to a supporter in that state, he
requested that the Bush faithful ``keep their powder dry.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bush keeps his party (and the rest of the country) in
suspense. He muses openly about the effect of a presidential run on
his family life, and his wife candidly admits that she is
reluctant.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, like Hamlet, Bush seems driven to assume a family
responsibility of a different sort: to pick up the standard which
fell when his father, President George Bush, lost his reelection
bid in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   There is a time factor, too. At a press conference on Jan. 20 he
was asked whether, if he decided against running this time around,
he would consider doing so in 2004.

<P>
   AUSTIN, TEXAS _ The band played ``The Eyes of Texas are Upon
You,'' yet nobody who attended George W. Bush's second inauguration
as governor on Jan. 19 could pretend that only Texas was watching.
</P>
<P>
   Mixed in with a day full of speeches, parades and thousands of
pounds of roasted meat was a buzz of excitement about the future of
Bush, who currently enjoys state approval ratings eclipsing 80
percent and yet, for now, is keeping his presidential aspirations
secret.
</P>
<P>
   With the Bush clan assembled on the platform, Bush used his
inaugural address to build on the idea of ``compassionate
conservatism'' which he introduced on election night last November.
</P>
<P>
   It was a clear attempt both to distance himself from the actions
of his Republican counterparts in Washington and to broaden the
appeal of his party. Bush spoke (in both English and Spanish) of
rallying ``the armies of compassion'' to give hope to all segments
of society.
</P>
<P>
   Extolling the virtues of economic progress, free markets and
free trade, the governor also issued a warning against putting too
much faith in material comforts at the expense of sacrificing
society's moral and spiritual core.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has the next 140 days, the length of the Texas legislative
session, to prove that he can make good on these cloudy maxims and
keep some of the policy promises he made during the governor's
race.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of his agenda are plans to cut property taxes and end
``social promotion'' in public schools, whereby students move on to
higher grades without meeting basic standards.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Texas Education Agency, although over 40,000
children aged nine or ten failed the state's standardized reading
test during the 1996-97 school year, all but 4,400 of them were
promoted to the next grade.
</P>
<P>
   The governor says he is also willing to support school vouchers,
a more controversial scheme both locally and nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Happily for Bush, Republicans dominate Texas for the first time
since the Civil War. With a majority in the state senate and, in
Rick Perry, the first Republican lieutenant-governor in Texan
history, the party is well-set to push its agenda through.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats, too, have become vocal supporters of Bush,
making it more difficult for a unified Democratic opposition to
block the governor's proposals.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush successfully navigates the legislative mine fields over
the coming months, while at the same time defining his political
philosophy for a national audience, he could then activate his
already formidable network of supporters and financial backers.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire (still, despite the maneuvers of bigger states,
the starting-point for any presidential campaign) he has a large
group of loyalists simply waiting for his word to start mobilizing.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, in a letter to a supporter in that state, he
requested that the Bush faithful ``keep their powder dry.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bush keeps his party (and the rest of the country) in
suspense. He muses openly about the effect of a presidential run on
his family life, and his wife candidly admits that she is
reluctant.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, like Hamlet, Bush seems driven to assume a family
responsibility of a different sort: to pick up the standard which
fell when his father, President George Bush, lost his reelection
bid in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   There is a time factor, too. At a press conference on Jan. 20 he
was asked whether, if he decided against running this time around,
he would consider doing so in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   He answered that he was very conscious of ``the tides of
history'' creating ``windows of opportunity.'' ``Should I wait,''
he said, ``the window would probably be closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Some questions still hover over the governor's past, especially
his reckless youth. Yet, for the time being, Bush can enjoy the
benefits of being an undeclared front-runner without answering the
nagging questions that lie ahead.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in the summer of 1995, Tom Daschle hit on an idea that now
bears remembering.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle was half a year into his job as the Democratic leader in
the Senate, and he was casting about for a way to resist the
formidable momentum of the Republican Contract with America.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of discussions with Mark Mellman, his pollster,
Daschle decided that the Republicans were most vulnerable on the
issue of Medicare, the popular government health program for the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   No matter that the Contract did not actually propose cuts in
Medicare, only cuts in its rate of growth: if Democrats screamed
``Cut!'' loudly enough, electoral comeback seemed certain.
</P>
<P>
   Over the ensuing year, all Democrats from President Clinton on
down adopted Daschle's clever ``Mediscare'' idea. It worked
brilliantly.
</P>
<P>
   Today the Contract with America has been replaced, in some ways
at least, by the grand spectacle of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Just as in 1995, the House Republicans have united behind a
radical scheme, and are clamoring for the Republican majority in
the Senate to endorse it. Just as in 1995, the Senate Republicans
may be observed wincing at the zeal of their House counterparts,
but agreeing, more or less, to go along with them.
</P>
<P>
   And, just as in 1995, it falls to Daschle to organize the
Democrats' counterattack. The question is whether Daschle's
spectacular success with Medicare will now be repeated.
</P>
<P>
   At first sight, Daschle seems unsuited to the role of
saviour-in-chief of the Democratic Party. He is a plain man from
the South Dakota prairie; his staunchest admirers concede that he
is not especially clever or charismatic.
</P>
<P>
   He became the Democrats' leader in the Senate partly thanks to
luck: one opponent lost his seat just before the leadership contest
in 1994, the other challenged him too late to beat him.
</P>
<P>
   He has never given an exciting speech, and stands for no
particular policies. One adviser, asked what motivates the man,
falls silent for a while, then says lamely that he wants to improve
the country.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, in a curious way, Daschle's plainness distinguishes
him. All senators, the saying goes, see a future president when
they look in the mirror; but Daschle, judging by his appearance as
well as by his controlled ego, uses mirrors sparingly.
</P>
<P>
   He stands out by not trying to stand out; and his modesty
endears him to the big egos that surround him.
</P>
<P>
   His colleagues appreciate the fact that Daschle does not hog the
limelight, or put his own image before that of his party; they
trust him to listen to their ideas without rushing to the nearest
microphone to take credit for them.
</P>
<P>
   And so Daschle is able to act as an honest broker, finding
common ground among fellow Democrats in the Senate. In a private
meeting last year, one senior senator declared that ``this little
sucker has done an amazing job of uniting us.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle's quiet skills are now on display in the impeachment
battle. A month ago, the betting was that the Senate Democrats
would speak with many tongues: some would be happy to see Clinton
strung up, others would be determined to obstruct the impeachment
process.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, many tongues have spoken: last Sunday, for example,
fully 19 senators popped up on the television talk shows. But,
remarkably, nearly all the Senate's famously independent souls have
conformed to party lines.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans want an extended trial with witnesses; Democrats
want a truncated trial without them.
</P>
<P>
   This is an embarrassment for the Republicans, and a victory for
Daschle. At the beginning of this month, Trent Lott, the Republican
leader in the Senate, promised a bipartisan process; and Daschle
encouraged him to believe that this was possible by striking a deal
(despite White House protests) on how the first stage of the trial
should be conducted.
</P>
<P>
   But, having staked his credibility on bipartisan comity, Lott
finds himself trapped. He can either cave in to Democratic demands
for a short trial, or he can go ahead without Democratic support _
and so lay himself open to the charge of rank partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   Having trapped Lott in this way, Daschle is now torturing him
mercilessly. Lott invited Democrats to attend a meeting with
President Clinton's prosecutors from the House; Daschle declined
the invitation.
</P>
<P>
   Lott suggested that a bipartisan group work on the prickly issue
of witnesses; Daschle called this premature and refused Democratic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterwards Daschle was subtly accusing Republicans of
railroading their schemes through the Senate. ``Given the comments
of Republicans, it appears to be inevitable that witnesses will be
deposed,'' he said meekly.
</P>
<P>
   So long as Daschle keeps his caucus together, there is no way
that the Senate's 55 Republicans can muster the 67 votes needed to
remove Clinton from office. Instead, if the Republicans choose to
extend the impeachment trial, they may remove some of themselves
from office.
</P>
<P>
   Voters will see impeachment as a partisan witch-hunt, and may
make their displeasure known at the polls; if this happened in a
big way, the Democrats might even retake control of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Next year 13 Republican senators are up for reelection in states
that voted for Clinton in 1996. If the Democrats pick up six seats,
Daschle will become the Senate majority leader. &QL;

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 900; OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   All of which leaves Republicans spitting with fury. Back in
1995, they attempted to enact a Contract with America full of
(mainly) sensible ideas; but, when the Democrats got in the way,
and the Republicans let the government close down rather than give
in, voters rounded on Republicans for their ``extremism.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, Republicans are trying a president who has shown
contempt for the law; but, when they suggest that the trial should
involve witnesses, they are seen as ``partisan harpoon-carriers out
of the black pit,'' as one Republican senator puts it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Daschle, the most effective partisan in both episodes,
is barely noticed. He is so modest, so nice, so unassuming. &QL;

<P>
   ANKARA _ Those who criticize Turkey's human-rights record can
take some comfort from the fact that Turks seem to be treating
animals better than they used to.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the story of a collie abandoned in the Aegean port of
Izmir was splashed on the front page of a mass-circulation
newspaper, Hurriyet. The dog apparently ``went on hunger strike
because of a broken heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of readers rang up, offering to adopt the unhappy
fellow. Dog-loving, it seems, is the latest fad.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of things this is odd because, despite Turkey's
government-enforced secularity, Islam has long frowned on dog
ownership. Orthodox Muslim teaching says that dogs are unhygienic:
they must not be nearby when Muslims pray.
</P>
<P>
   But that is just one reason for many Turks' recent dogginess:
actively secular Turks like to show off their dogs partly to
demonstrate how European they are.
</P>
<P>

   ANKARA _ Those who criticize Turkey's human-rights record can
take some comfort from the fact that Turks seem to be treating
animals better than they used to.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the story of a collie abandoned in the Aegean port of
Izmir was splashed on the front page of a mass-circulation
newspaper, Hurriyet. The dog apparently ``went on hunger strike
because of a broken heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of readers rang up, offering to adopt the unhappy
fellow. Dog-loving, it seems, is the latest fad.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of things this is odd because, despite Turkey's
government-enforced secularity, Islam has long frowned on dog
ownership. Orthodox Muslim teaching says that dogs are unhygienic:
they must not be nearby when Muslims pray.
</P>
<P>
   But that is just one reason for many Turks' recent dogginess:
actively secular Turks like to show off their dogs partly to
demonstrate how European they are.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, dogs were, at best, exotic. Some breeds were on
display alongside tigers and giraffes in Ankara's zoo. What changed

NEW YORK REPORTEDLY PROBES ON-LINE AUCTION HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALAN SARACEVIC  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ eBay Inc., the high-flying Internet auction
house, is being investigated by New York officials based on
consumer allegations of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New York City Department of Consumer Affairs is actively
investigating complaints regarding alleged fraudulent sales at
on-line auction houses,'' Commissioner Jules Polonetsky said
Monday. A source in New York confirmed eBay was part of the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   At question are a number of person-to-person transactions in
which dealers allegedly sold the same piece of sports memorabilia
to multiple buyers.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report published in the New York Post, the
Consumer Affairs agency was able to purchase a baseball autographed
by Hall of Fame pitcher Christy Mathewson that had allegedly been
sold to several different buyers at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   While eBay (www.ebay.com) officials would not confirm or deny
the allegations, they said their attorneys were in touch with New
York officials.
</P>
<P>
   eBay, which is based in San Jose, Calif., issued a statement
saying: ``It has always been eBay's practice to offer to fully
cooperate with any investigation involving improper items on the
site. eBay takes pride in its close working relationship with law
enforcement and regulatory agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 15, eBay announced an update of its on-line ``trust and
safety program.'' Among the security features offered to its
customers at that time were free insurance from Lloyd's of London,
a user-identification system, easy access to escrow and
``clarification of illegal items that are not permissible for
sale.''
</P>
<P>
   The company said that it receives an average of 27 complaints
about fraud for every 1 million auctions. It conducted about 9.5
million auctions in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement to customers, Meg Whitman, the president and
chief executive of eBay, said the company had ``zero tolerance for
fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have committed and will continue to commit resources to
have the most comprehensive programs in order to keep eBay a safe
harbor for on-line person-to-person trading,'' Whitman said.

HOUSTON OFFICER MISSES UNDERCOVER ROLE AFTER DEALER'S BULLET CUTS
ACT SHORT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Photos available on NYT database) 
 
By LEIGH HOPPER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Vonda Higgins could have earned an Academy Award for
her portrayal of a drug addict.
</P>
<P>
   Shuffling back and forth, almost dancing in place as she rubbed
her hands together, the undercover officer ``geeked'' _ acted like
a crackhead who needs the drug but has no money. Her hair stuck out
wild, and she wore house shoes with her ``crack clothes'' for a
convincing effect.
</P>
<P>
   Her partner, Ralph Chaison, was known to pooch out his belly and
ask a skeptical dope dealer, ``You ever seen law with a stomach
like this?'' Chaison could wisecrack his way through danger, but
Higgins tricked criminals with dead-on mimicry.
</P>
<P>
   In five years working narcotics for the Houston Police
Department, the duo fooled hundreds of crooks, leading to hundreds
of arrests. They played the roles of boyfriend/girlfriend or
prostitute/john so well, they cracked themselves up. They often
talked of putting together a curriculum for the police academy.
</P>
<P>
   But Higgins' make-believe guises put her in the path of
real-life violence. Her street-theater stardom abruptly ended last
Feb. 4 when she and Chaison encountered a dealer who didn't buy
their act. Now Higgins is in an unwanted role she'll play for the
rest of her life.
</P>
<P>
   Just before 11 a.m., the pair was starting a special effort to
stop overt drug activity at a far southwest Houston apartment
complex. Higgins waited in the truck as Chaison approached the iron
fence where the dealer waited.
</P>
<P>
   Chaison, 45, bought a $20 rock, the size of a Tic-Tac, and
turned to go. The 21-year-old dealer spoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put it in your mouth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chaison was startled. ``What?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not the law, put it in your mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaison paused.
</P>
<P>
   Crack is such a potent drug, a person's hand will go numb in the
spot where it touches the skin. Plus, dealers often hide rocks in
their mouth or anus. Real addicts don't care.
</P>
<P>
   Chaison made an excuse: ``It's for the girl in the truck, man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You the law.''
</P>
<P>
   The dealer pulled his pistol first; both started firing. Chaison
managed to get behind a tree. He glanced over and saw Higgins
calling for help on the radio &UR; . &LR;  When he turned back, the dealer
had disappeared from view. Chaison heard more gunfire, then a thud
_ a sound he instantly recognized after nearly two decades of
police work.
</P>
<P>
   It was the sound of Higgins' body hitting the street.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
PROGRESS IS SLOW &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a year later, Higgins, 37, wears a neat little scar where
the bullet entered her neck below her left jaw. The 9 mm bullet
remains lodged next to her spine. She is considered a quadriplegic,
although she has regained some use of her hands and arms.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of a preacher, Higgins lives alone in her own home
_ her parents, who live in nearby Pearland, want her to be able to
make it without them _ but she requires 24-hour nursing. Visits and
calls from friends, co-workers and members of her large family fill
her time.
</P>
<P>
   She just got a dachshund puppy, which she named ``Latin'' after
a close friend on the police force. Twice a week, the puppy's
namesake, Officer O.J. Latin, picks Higgins up from her home and
drives her to The Institute for Rehabilitation and Research in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   After spending two weeks at Ben Taub Hospital immediately after
she was shot, Higgins went to TIRR for two months of inpatient
treatment during which she quickly recovered her sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins tormented her protective mother by pretending to choke
on a pickle, just to listen to her howl for help. On another
occasion, as Higgins' mother prayed, ``Lord, will you move my
daughter's leg?'' Higgins got an aide to move it and said, ``See,
Mom? My leg is moving.''
</P>
<P>
   The former star of undercover narcotics is now an outpatient at
TIRR. During a recent therapy session, she worked with physical
therapist Melisa Bennett to strengthen her arms and shoulders _ the
muscles she must rely on now for all of life's tasks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it seem easier, or just about as hard (as last time)?''
Bennett asked as Higgins, leaning forward, struggled to push
herself into a sitting-up position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just about as hard,'' Higgins said, falling forward with a
groan.
</P>
<P>
   Progress is slow and measured in tiny increments. All this is so
she can return to the work she loves.
</P>
<P>
   She recently got a donated van that can transport her motorized
wheelchair. She's able to feed herself, brush her teeth and write
with the help of a special brace. But she also needs
catheterization every four hours. She is only now learning to keep
her balance sitting on the edge of her bed. She can't open a door
for herself.
</P>
<P>
   Her goal is ``to go back and do my job as a police officer,''
she said. ``I pray for a complete healing ... Until that time
comes, I'm going to continue with what I have.''
</P>
<P>
   In December, Higgins testified against the man who shot her,
finishing the job she started that day outside the apartment
complex. In court, Higgins politely referred to Robert Demond
Lavern as ``that gentleman.'' Lavern never looked at her, staring
at the table in front of him instead. (He was sentenced to 24 years
for aggravated assault of a public servant.)
</P>
<P>
   Chaison was the one who wept at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   He and Higgins had ``gelled'' in the field. It was like a good
marriage. They understood the nuances of each other's gestures and
tones of voice. When one sensed danger, the other caught on right
away. Chaison now rides with another officer who's not as easy to
read. He said he's getting better at interpreting his colleague's
actions, but Chaison still misses some cues.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins, he said, was ``one of the best, with the potential to
be the best.''
</P>
<P>
   The bullet stole other things, too. Chaison, a minister, had
been counseling Higgins and her boyfriend of five years, police
Officer Kenneth Wiltz, in preparation for marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Wiltz has remained at Higgins' side, learning some of the
procedures required for her care, but plans to marry have been
tabled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of some issues I need to work out,'' Higgins
explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, I don't want to be anybody's bride being rolled
down the aisle. He may argue that point.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`IT REALLY CLEANED THIS PLACE UP' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The drug activity the undercover police were fighting a year ago
in far west Houston shocked Higgins with its openness. Young men
were dealing during daylight hours near single-family homes, a
Buddhist temple and places where children played.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the problem is nowhere in sight. Flags and balloons fly
in front of the landscaped entrance of The Arbor at Dairy Ashford.
A banner reads ``Come See Our New Look.''
</P>
<P>
   Property manager Gayle Kibble, whose company bought the former
rent-subsidized complex three days before the shooting, credits the
difference to the work done by undercover narcotics officers, HPD's
gang task force and off-duty Houston police officers she hired to
patrol the grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally changed,'' said assistant manager Cindy Mata, who
was working the day Higgins was shot. ``It's sad, it was a tragedy,
but it really cleaned this place up.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only one corner in a city full of such places, but
Higgins relished even the small successes. She liked to joke,
``It's really not a bad job _ other than the fact you carry a gun
and could get shot at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   But the humor is a thin cover for the passion she felt for her
vocation. Undercover narcotics work was her calling.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't miss something until you can't do it, I guess,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss it. I really do.''
</P>

WALTER'S VIBURNUM CAN GROW TO 12 TO 15 FEET 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Would you please give me some information on Walter's
viburnum? I'm especially interested in the height and spread of
these beautiful spring bloomers.
</P>
<P>
   A: Walter's viburnum (``Viburnum obovata'') is an attractive,
dense shrub good for hedges or to use alone. The foliage is about 1
1/2 inches long, and glossy; the white flowers appear in clusters
about 2 inches across; and blue-black fruit is enjoyed by wildlife.
Mature height is 12 to 15 feet, and I understand the spread is in
the same range. Sun and a well-draining fertile soil are best.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When do I prune my climbing rose? It is an old rose.
</P>
<P>
   A: Prune repeat flowering roses while they are dormant. Prune
climbers that bloom only once a year after they have flowered.
</P>
<P>
   We plan to have more on pruning roses soon. Feb. 14 is the
traditional day to prune roses.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Recently, my corn plant bloomed. I have never seen one of
these flowers before. What do I do with the bloom?
</P>
<P>
   A: Corn plants (``Dracaena'') occasionally flower. Remove the
bloom when it has faded. Your best bet at propagation is air
layering, by removing a crown from a leggy cane and rooting, or by
rooting cane cuttings.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My succulent elephant foot plant has white flowers with
maroon centers and a gray trunk. It is huge, about 7 feet wide now,
and falling over. What is the best way to propagate?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sounds like you have a relative of the Madagascar palm,
``Pachypodium lamerei.'' Plants in this genus often have gray to
brown, spiny trunks and swollen bases. The flowers are followed by
twin-horned seedpods, and you can try propagating by sowing these
seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Q: From what I've seen through the years, one killer for fungus
is chlorine, and a prime source for chlorine is liquid bleach.
Builders and repairmen use bleach on siding and brick to kill
fungus. Bleach in the foot bath in locker rooms keeps down fungus.
So I gave it a shot on brown patch. I put a strong solution of
bleach in my hose-end sprayer and then sprayed the infected areas.
It worked like a charm.
</P>
<P>
   The bleach did not harm the grass. I can't remember, but I may
have added a few drops of liquid dish soap. But if I did, it was
just as a wetting agent. I'm wondering if the same treatment might
work for take-all patch as it, like brown patch, is a fungus.
</P>
<P>
   A: I know bleach is a common disinfectant and used to clean
garden tools to keep from spreading disease from plant to plant.
I've heard of gardeners using a 10 percent bleach solution (1 part
bleach to 9 parts water) as a dip for cuttings taken from a plant
that is showing signs of a disease. And a bleach dip, some believe,
helps prevent damping-off, a fungal disease, in seedling flats when
the soil is drenched with a 2 percent solution (2 1/2 tablespoons
bleach to a gallon of water). You can also just sterilize the flat
with a bleach solution to kill any fungi that would trigger
damping-off, and use a sterilized potting medium.
</P>
<P>
   I do use a diluted bleach solution to clean the outside of our
house, but I am careful to avoid much contact with nearby shrubs.
Bleach, a mix of sodium and calcium hypochlorite, may kill certain
fungi, but it also kills beneficials, as it is not selective.
Chlorine bleach may damage plants, especially if it hits the
foliage. In discussions on using gray water in the garden, some
caution against the use of such recycled water containing chlorine
on plants, especially edibles. I have read where a mixture of
household bleach and horticultural oil is used to combat the fungal
disease fusarium blight on cool-season grasses, but I have yet to
come across documentation _ verbal or written _ of using bleach on
St. Augustine, a warm-season grass. All this means is that while I
can't dispute your experiment, I can't confirm it yet either. Thank
you for writing, however, as your information is certainly
interesting. I would love to hear from anyone who has any knowledge
about bleach as a fungicide.

HOUSTON OFFICER MISSES UNDERCOVER ROLE AFTER DEALER'S BULLET CUTS
ACT SHORT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Photos available on NYT database) 
 
By LEIGH HOPPER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Vonda Higgins could have earned an Academy Award for
her portrayal of a drug addict.
</P>
<P>
   Shuffling back and forth, almost dancing in place as she rubbed
her hands together, the undercover officer ``geeked'' _ acted like
a crackhead who needs the drug but has no money. Her hair stuck out
wild, and she wore house shoes with her ``crack clothes'' for a
convincing effect.
</P>
<P>
   Her partner, Ralph Chaison, was known to pooch out his belly and
ask a skeptical dope dealer, ``You ever seen law with a stomach
like this?'' Chaison could wisecrack his way through danger, but
Higgins tricked criminals with dead-on mimicry.
</P>
<P>
   In five years working narcotics for the Houston Police
Department, the duo fooled hundreds of crooks, leading to hundreds
of arrests. They played the roles of boyfriend/girlfriend or
prostitute/john so well, they cracked themselves up. They often
talked of putting together a curriculum for the police academy.
</P>
<P>
   But Higgins' make-believe guises put her in the path of
real-life violence. Her street-theater stardom abruptly ended last
Feb. 4 when she and Chaison encountered a dealer who didn't buy
their act. Now Higgins is in an unwanted role she'll play for the
rest of her life.
</P>
<P>
   Just before 11 a.m., the pair was starting a special effort to
stop overt drug activity at a far southwest Houston apartment
complex. Higgins waited in the truck as Chaison approached the iron
fence where the dealer waited.
</P>
<P>
   Chaison, 45, bought a $20 rock, the size of a Tic-Tac, and
turned to go. The 21-year-old dealer spoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put it in your mouth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chaison was startled. ``What?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not the law, put it in your mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaison paused.
</P>
<P>
   Crack is such a potent drug, a person's hand will go numb in the
spot where it touches the skin. Plus, dealers often hide rocks in
their mouth or anus. Real addicts don't care.
</P>
<P>
   Chaison made an excuse: ``It's for the girl in the truck, man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You the law.''
</P>
<P>
   The dealer pulled his pistol first; both started firing. Chaison
managed to get behind a tree. He glanced over and saw Higgins
calling for help on the radio &UR; . &LR;  When he turned back, the dealer
had disappeared from view. Chaison heard more gunfire, then a thud
_ a sound he instantly recognized after nearly two decades of
police work.
</P>
<P>
   It was the sound of Higgins' body hitting the street.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
PROGRESS IS SLOW &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a year later, Higgins, 37, wears a neat little scar where
the bullet entered her neck below her left jaw. The 9 mm bullet
remains lodged next to her spine. She is considered a quadriplegic,
although she has regained some use of her hands and arms.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of a preacher, Higgins lives alone in her own home
_ her parents, who live in nearby Pearland, want her to be able to
make it without them _ but she requires 24-hour nursing. Visits and
calls from friends, co-workers and members of her large family fill
her time.
</P>
<P>
   She just got a dachshund puppy, which she named ``Latin'' after
a close friend on the police force. Twice a week, the puppy's
namesake, Officer O.J. Latin, picks Higgins up from her home and
drives her to The Institute for Rehabilitation and Research in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   After spending two weeks at Ben Taub Hospital immediately after
she was shot, Higgins went to TIRR for two months of inpatient
treatment during which she quickly recovered her sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins tormented her protective mother by pretending to choke
on a pickle, just to listen to her howl for help. On another
occasion, as Higgins' mother prayed, ``Lord, will you move my
daughter's leg?'' Higgins got an aide to move it and said, ``See,
Mom? My leg is moving.''
</P>
<P>
   The former star of undercover narcotics is now an outpatient at
TIRR. During a recent therapy session, she worked with physical
therapist Melisa Bennett to strengthen her arms and shoulders _ the
muscles she must rely on now for all of life's tasks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it seem easier, or just about as hard (as last time)?''
Bennett asked as Higgins, leaning forward, struggled to push
herself into a sitting-up position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just about as hard,'' Higgins said, falling forward with a
groan.
</P>
<P>
   Progress is slow and measured in tiny increments. All this is so
she can return to the work she loves.
</P>
<P>
   She recently got a donated van that can transport her motorized
wheelchair. She's able to feed herself, brush her teeth and write
with the help of a special brace. But she also needs
catheterization every four hours. She is only now learning to keep
her balance sitting on the edge of her bed. She can't open a door
for herself.
</P>
<P>
   Her goal is ``to go back and do my job as a police officer,''
she said. ``I pray for a complete healing ... Until that time
comes, I'm going to continue with what I have.''
</P>
<P>
   In December, Higgins testified against the man who shot her,
finishing the job she started that day outside the apartment
complex. In court, Higgins politely referred to Robert Demond
Lavern as ``that gentleman.'' Lavern never looked at her, staring
at the table in front of him instead. (He was sentenced to 24 years
for aggravated assault of a public servant.)
</P>
<P>
   Chaison was the one who wept at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   He and Higgins had ``gelled'' in the field. It was like a good
marriage. They understood the nuances of each other's gestures and
tones of voice. When one sensed danger, the other caught on right
away. Chaison now rides with another officer who's not as easy to
read. He said he's getting better at interpreting his colleague's
actions, but Chaison still misses some cues.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins, he said, was ``one of the best, with the potential to
be the best.''
</P>
<P>
   The bullet stole other things, too. Chaison, a minister, had
been counseling Higgins and her boyfriend of five years, police
Officer Kenneth Wiltz, in preparation for marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Wiltz has remained at Higgins' side, learning some of the
procedures required for her care, but plans to marry have been
tabled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of some issues I need to work out,'' Higgins
explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, I don't want to be anybody's bride being rolled
down the aisle. He may argue that point.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`IT REALLY CLEANED THIS PLACE UP' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The drug activity the undercover police were fighting a year ago
in far west Houston shocked Higgins with its openness. Young men
were dealing during daylight hours near single-family homes, a
Buddhist temple and places where children played.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the problem is nowhere in sight. Flags and balloons fly
in front of the landscaped entrance of The Arbor at Dairy Ashford.
A banner reads ``Come See Our New Look.''
</P>
<P>
   Property manager Gayle Kibble, whose company bought the former
rent-subsidized complex three days before the shooting, credits the
difference to the work done by undercover narcotics officers, HPD's
gang task force and off-duty Houston police officers she hired to
patrol the grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally changed,'' said assistant manager Cindy Mata, who
was working the day Higgins was shot. ``It's sad, it was a tragedy,
but it really cleaned this place up.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only one corner in a city full of such places, but
Higgins relished even the small successes. She liked to joke,
``It's really not a bad job _ other than the fact you carry a gun
and could get shot at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   But the humor is a thin cover for the passion she felt for her
vocation. Undercover narcotics work was her calling.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't miss something until you can't do it, I guess,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss it. I really do.''
</P>

 SAMARANCH SHOULD RESIGN IF HE CARES  
 Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GWEN KNAPP  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ On the surface, this looks like a victimless
crime. So what if the International Olympic Committee takes
extravagant freebies from cities bidding to host the next Games?
Who really gets hurt?
</P>
<P>
   The cities that lay out the payola and don't end up with the
five-ring prize? The cities that don't have the resources to commit
world-class bribery? The corporate sponsors who attach their good
names to the Olympics?
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to work up much sympathy for any of them, isn't it?
And what about the athletes? Does back-room dealing really hurt
them? The Olympics are big business now, and they know that. How
can they complain when some of the business flows their way, when
commercialization has widened the stages on which they perform?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Jeff Rouse has no complaints. The Stanford University
graduate went to two Olympics, won three gold medals and a silver
in swimming, captained the 1996 American men's team in Atlanta. He
also was in Barcelona, where rooms in the steamy Olympic Village
lacked air conditioning. Some athletes objected.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was mostly Americans,'' he said. ``Because we're so
spoiled. In Spain, most people don't have air conditioning. It's a
cultural difference. Here, we're used to having it in every house.
... I don't expect to live in luxury when I'm at the Olympic
Village. That would make it too easy, in a way.''
</P>
<P>
   Rouse is not surprised by the bribery scandal. He is not naive.
He knows how the Olympics work, how the world works. He'd accept it
all, if it weren't for one thing. He's still a true believer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've ever seen `Chariots of Fire,' the beauty of that
movie, that's what the Olympics are about to me,'' he said. ``To
me, the IOC members should watch that movie over and over and over
again and then ask themselves if they are living up to the ideals
that movie espouses.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea seems almost corny, doesn't it? Rouse is a thoroughly
modern Olympic champion. He had a deal with Nike. He circulated
petitions to fight performance-enhancing drugs, pushing for more
comprehensive testing. He competed in a totally different arena
from the runners in the 1920 Olympics, the characters in ``Chariots
of Fire.'' But he still believes in the romance of the Games, that
they are more than a conduit to sell Coca-Cola and Big Macs.
</P>
<P>
   The bribery betrays that sentimental vision of the Olympics. In
a few weeks, IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch will convene an
international conference on performance-enhancing drugs. Can we
trust that he will make a sincere effort to combat doping when
covering up drug use is the best way to protect the prestige of his
fiefdom?
</P>
<P>
   Will the conference be just another token gesture, more
public-relations gloss, like this weekend's expulsion of six IOC
members who accepted gifts from bid cities?
</P>
<P>
   If Samaranch meant to clean house thoroughly, he would have
resigned. He should have been willing to give up everything for the
Games. That's what the athletes do.
</P>
<P>
   Rouse is now 28, retired from swimming, and living in
Fredericksburg, Va., his hometown. He is getting a real-estate
license, and he is engaged to be married in August. He serves on
the steering committee for U.S. Swimming, a commitment that runs
through the 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   He is the perfect athlete representative. He is not rash or
unreasonable. He makes a point of saying that there are worthy,
uncorrupted IOC members. He concedes that a lot of Olympic funds
are used to create athletic facilities. But still, he believes that
the Olympics have been pulled too far away from the athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt that decisions are made based on the bottom
line rather than what's good for the athletes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He offers an example: In 2000, the swimming competition will
expand by two days to add semifinal heats for every event. The
semis were eliminated 20 years ago because they wore the swimmers
out. The meet was too long. But television apparently liked the
extra elimination round, and two more days of swimming meant more
ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no need for it,'' Rouse said. ``Technically, it's not
good for the swimmers.''
</P>
<P>
   The more the Games become divided from the athletes, the more
they will suffer. Bribe-takers on the IOC only widen the gap. Every
dime they take says that the Olympics are about the power-brokers,
not about the true believers.

   NAPA-BRANDY (Undated) _ The Napa Valley is fairly popping with
vineyards. On weekends, it turns into a playpen for yuppies. But
there is one intriguing wine-related activity that remains in its
infancy, little noticed by the thundering herds, in the Napa Valley
or elsewhere in California: distilling. Exactly five tenacious
enterprises in this state are engaged in the exacting business of
producing brandies or eaux-de-vies by traditional Continental
methods. All of them turn out products that can stand comparison
with their counterparts in Europe, where the custom of drinking a
digestif _ a small glass of dry spirits after dinner, perhaps with
a coffee and a cigar _ is far better established than in the United
States. By R.W. Apple Jr.

gratin, a tall square stack, browned on top and sagging on the

fine layer, like a piece of puff pastry. Most chefs can dazzle home
cooks with their knife skills, but even they cannot exact such
precision on sweet potatoes and apples unaided. Their secret, the
tool that no chef would live without, is the mandoline. And this

   BEIRUT _ Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown. Until last
week, Crown Prince Hassan thought he wore one. Until today
(Tuesday), his brother King Hussein might have expected a few more
months upon the throne; but every Jordanian knew the significance
of the monarch's sudden flight back to America. The king is dying,
his final battle with lymphoma cancer nearing its end.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Amman _ in a royal palace where shock is said to emanate
from every face _ Abdullah, the new crown prince and eldest son, is
hourly expected to be made regent.
</P>
<P>
   There is indeed something Shakespearian about Hussein's
departure. We may occasionally have made light of the Plucky Little
King, but now he has disgraced the cozy, avuncular figure of his
younger brother Hassan with a speed that would have been the envy
of any Tudor.
</P>
<P>
   First there was the veiled criticism of Hassan in King Hussein's
television interview last week _ then the failure of Hassan to show
up at the airport for the king's return from his ``successful''
hospital treatment in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   And then the sword fell. In his letter Tuesday, published even
as the dying man was being rushed back to the Mayo Clinic in
Minnesota with a low blood count and ``fever,'' the king accused
Hassan of plotting little less than a coup d'etat.
</P>
<P>
   His sins were already known, of course. In the king's absence _
while chemotherapy was turning his brother into a ghost on the
other side of the Atlantic _ Hassan tried to fire Hussein's most
loyal servant, Field Marshal Abdul-Hafez Mureii-Kaabneh, chief of
staff of the Jordanian army.
</P>
<P>
   The word treachery was not used. But what other conclusion was
the king likely to draw from the stories that had reached him daily
from Amman?
</P>
<P>
   The newspapers in Jordan were starting to carry Crown Prince
Hassan's picture on every front page, on every day of every week.
Flattering portraits of Hassan _ a portly and unathletic figure at
the best of times _ flooded the country along with pictures (a
dangerous precedent, this) of his own son.
</P>
<P>
   Although he spoke to the king many times daily by phone, his
Pakistani wife, Princess Sarvath, never bothered to visit Hussein
in his American clinic _ even when the princess spent a month in
Washington. Hassan clearly believed the king would never return to
Amman.
</P>
<P>
   Did Abdullah _ himself a lieutenant general, an Oxford and
Georgetown graduate and Sandhurst trainee _ warn his father of what
Hassan was plotting within the army? The word mutiny is darkly
muttered in Amman.
</P>
<P>
   As commander of a special forces ``counter-terrorism'' unit,
Abdullah must have known what was afoot. Or did the Americans,
never fond of the stubborn Hassan, feed the king's suspicions in
his clinic?
</P>
<P>
   As for Queen Noor, the king's present wife, we can only imagine
her reaction. A strong-willed woman, she must have wished her own
son Hamzah to be crown prince. Indeed it was widely believed in
Amman that if Hassan had become King, Queen Noor would have left
the country.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Jordanians are waiting for the fatal news from America.
Only a week after they had welcomed back their monarch, he has
departed. Sad stories of the death of kings do not come easily to a
nation which has been ruled by one monarch for almost half a
century.
</P>
<P>
   And Crown Prince Abdullah _ how strange it seems to use those
words _ must know that perfidy lurks along his borders.
</P>
<P>
   Will Israel, which sent a murder squad to the streets of Amman
after Hussein's peace treaty with Israel, resist the temptation for
intrigue?
</P>
<P>
   Will Iraq's Saddam Hussein, who has also sent his assassination
experts to Amman, leave the young crown prince in peace? What will
Syrian President Assad _ grooming a son for his succession _ feel
for the parachutist prince who will soon rule Jordan?
</P>
<P>
   They all know that Abdullah already commands a special
intelligence unit and a public security brigade. Hitherto he has
spent his time countering Iraqi smuggling and what he once called
``terrorist infiltrations'' from Syria. Now that will be the least
of his troubles. &QL;

DIMAGGIO CAUGHT THIS BOBBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one is immune from making mistakes, but NBC's doozy Sunday
night was made worse when Joe DiMaggio actually was watching at the
time NBC declared that he was dead.
</P>
<P>
   Morris Engelberg, DiMaggio's friend and lawyer, and the Yankee
Hall of Famer were watching a video of ``Gunfight at the OK
Corral'' at DiMaggio's home on Sunday night. They stopped the tape
to watch ``Dateline NBC,'' during which a crawl came on the bottom
of screen, stating, ``This is an NBC News Special Report. Baseball
legend Joe DiMaggio has died at his Florida home. He was 84 years
old and had.'' The crawl then ended abruptly.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 minutes later, NBC ran another crawl, correcting the
earlier one.
</P>
<P>
   Embarrassed by the mishap, NBC quickly apologized to DiMaggio. A
network official explained that a technician in the New York
control room mistakenly aired the erroneous report.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio was released last week from Memorial Regional Hospital
in Hollywood, Fla., after spending 99 days in intensive care. He
suffers from lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The NBC error triggered an outpouring of criticism and medical
reports assessing DiMaggio's condition. His doctor, Earl Barron,
faxed a statement to the Associated Press Monday that said, ``He is
progressing nicely since his discharge from Memorial Regional
Hospital one week ago. Over the weekend, his physical therapy has
progressed to the point that he is walking. Reports of his
condition worsening are not true.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio's brother Dom, 82, who lives in Florida, told WBZ's Bob
Lobel in Boston that the erroneous report is another example of
media overzealousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media calls here every 30 minutes to see if my brother has
passed away,'' said Dom DiMaggio, the former Red Sox outfielder.
``I don't know why they continue to call. It causes so much anguish
not only to Joe and his family but also his fans around the world.
It's kind of ghoulish. They must get a medal or something if they
are the first ones to report that Joe has passed.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Simpson makes list
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ESPN has O.J. Simpson ranked 49th on its list of the 100
greatest American athletes of the century, a selection bound to
generate a little criticism, but the choices are based strictly on
field performance.
</P>
<P>
   During a 30-minute profile Friday night, ESPN will mention the
fact that Simpson went on trial, and was acquitted, for the murder
of his wife and her friend, but the show will be about the Juice,
the football player.
</P>
<P>
   But even the panelists who made the selections are conflicted.
</P>
<P>
   Author George Plimpton said, ``It's a shame. I think he was
guilty, and you just can't get that out of your mind. If he were in
prison, actually serving out his term, I think one would begin to
think of him more as a football player. The fact that he's not
paying a penalty always sits up there as a barricade.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland Browns great Jim Brown was more direct.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's try to give some credit where credit is due,'' Brown
said. ``O.J. was a tremendous athlete. This man was a great
sprinter. This man was one of the greatest running backs that ever
lived.''
</P>
<P>
   Former NFL defensive end Deacon Jones echoed Brown's sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You gonna take all your cheers back?'' Jones asked. ``Nothing
he did outside the game has anything to do with his contributions
to the sport. Not one iota. Now, if you hate him over here for what
he was accused of, you understand, then hate him over there, but
over here you have to give him his dues.''

 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT _ Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown. Until last
week, Crown Prince Hassan thought he wore one. Until today
(Tuesday), his brother King Hussein might have expected a few more
months upon the throne; but every Jordanian knew the significance
of the monarch's sudden flight back to America. The king is dying,
his final battle with lymphoma cancer nearing its end.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Amman _ in a royal palace where shock is said to emanate
from every face _ Abdullah, the new crown prince and eldest son, is
hourly expected to be made regent.
</P>
<P>
   There is indeed something Shakespearian about Hussein's
departure. We may occasionally have made light of the Plucky Little
King, but now he has disgraced the cozy, avuncular figure of his
younger brother Hassan with a speed that would have been the envy
of any Tudor.
</P>
<P>
   First there was the veiled criticism of Hassan in King Hussein's
television interview last week _ then the failure of Hassan to show
up at the airport for the king's return from his ``successful''
hospital treatment in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   And then the sword fell. In his letter Tuesday, published even
as the dying man was being rushed back to the Mayo Clinic in
Minnesota with a low blood count and ``fever,'' the king accused
Hassan of plotting little less than a coup d'etat.
</P>
<P>
   His sins were already known, of course. In the king's absence _
while chemotherapy was turning his brother into a ghost on the
other side of the Atlantic _ Hassan tried to fire Hussein's most
loyal servant, Field Marshal Abdul-Hafez Mureii-Kaabneh, chief of
staff of the Jordanian army.
</P>
<P>
   The word treachery was not used. But what other conclusion was
the king likely to draw from the stories that had reached him daily
from Amman?
</P>
<P>
   The newspapers in Jordan were starting to carry Crown Prince
Hassan's picture on every front page, on every day of every week.
Flattering portraits of Hassan _ a portly and unathletic figure at
the best of times _ flooded the country along with pictures (a
dangerous precedent, this) of his own son.
</P>
<P>
   Although he spoke to the king many times daily by phone, his
Pakistani wife, Princess Sarvath, never bothered to visit Hussein
in his American clinic _ even when the princess spent a month in
Washington. Hassan clearly believed the king would never return to
Amman.
</P>
<P>
   Did Abdullah _ himself a lieutenant general, an Oxford and
Georgetown graduate and Sandhurst trainee _ warn his father of what
Hassan was plotting within the army? The word mutiny is darkly
muttered in Amman.
</P>
<P>
   As commander of a special forces ``counter-terrorism'' unit,
Abdullah must have known what was afoot. Or did the Americans,
never fond of the stubborn Hassan, feed the king's suspicions in
his clinic?
</P>
<P>
   As for Queen Noor, the king's present wife, we can only imagine
her reaction. A strong-willed woman, she must have wished her own
son Hamzah to be crown prince. Indeed it was widely believed in
Amman that if Hassan had become King, Queen Noor would have left
the country.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Jordanians are waiting for the fatal news from America.
Only a week after they had welcomed back their monarch, he has
departed. Sad stories of the death of kings do not come easily to a
nation which has been ruled by one monarch for almost half a
century.
</P>
<P>
   And Crown Prince Abdullah _ how strange it seems to use those
words _ must know that perfidy lurks along his borders.
</P>
<P>
   Will Israel, which sent a murder squad to the streets of Amman
after Hussein's peace treaty with Israel, resist the temptation for
intrigue?
</P>
<P>
   Will Iraq's Saddam Hussein, who has also sent his assassination
experts to Amman, leave the young crown prince in peace? What will
Syrian President Assad _ grooming a son for his succession _ feel
for the parachutist prince who will soon rule Jordan?
</P>
<P>
   They all know that Abdullah already commands a special
intelligence unit and a public security brigade. Hitherto he has
spent his time countering Iraqi smuggling and what he once called
``terrorist infiltrations'' from Syria. Now that will be the least
of his troubles. &QL;

EL FARNAWANI HAS BEEN HIRED BEFORE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (s, f and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Mahmoud El Farnawani, the Canadian middleman
identified by the International Olympic Committee Sunday as having
received $161,000 from Salt Lake City to ``influence'' North
Africans to support that city's bid for the 2002 Winter Games, also
worked over the years as a paid consultant for other cities seeking
to win the prestigious Games.
</P>
<P>
   According to acquaintances and news reports, the 65-year-old
Egyptian-born entrepreneur from Oakville, Ontario, was paid $60,000
by Sydney to help win the 2000 Summer Olympics and was hired by
Athens as a consultant in its successful bid for the 2004 games. He
has also worked for Toronto, Nagano (Japan), and Istanbul to lobby
North Africans on the Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Nagano was site of the 1998 Winter Games while Toronto, which
bid for the 1996 Summer Games, and Istanbul (2000 Summer Games)
failed in their efforts to be selected as Olympic cities.
</P>
<P>
   El Farnawani was named in this week's report by the executive
board of the IOC on the investigation that led to the recommended
expulsion of six committee members for accepting cash and other
gifts from organizers of the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City.
Four of the officials are Africans, and one is from the North
African nation of Sudan. In addition, two of three IOC members who
have resigned in the scandal are African, one from Libya, the other
from Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic officials say there is no evidence that El Farnawani did
anything wrong in his efforts to convince Olympic Committee members
from North Africa that the Utah city was the best place for the
Games. He was hired by the Salt Lake organizing committee ``on the
basis . . . he might be able to influence North African members,''
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing illegal or improper about that, said El
Farawani's lawyer, David M. Goodman of Toronto, saying the report
exonerates his longtime client.
</P>
<P>
   ``He worked as a lobbyist, as a middleman, as a protocol man,''
but not as a bagman, Goodman said. ``He has been on the periphery
of the Olympics for years and years.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, El Farnawani has worked on the edges of the Olympic
movement since the 1950s, first as a volleyball coach in his native
Egypt and later as a well-paid agent of influence for cities hoping
to snare the games.
</P>
<P>
   He emigrated to Canada in the early 1970s by way of Libya.
</P>
<P>
   ``My belief is I did nothing wrong,'' El Farnawani told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   As president of Trade &AMP; Sports Canada Inc., an Ontario firm that
specializes in sports souvenirs, El Farnawani won a merchandising
franchise for the 1988 Winter Games in Calgary, Alberta.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, El Farnawani has been able to sell his services
to Olympic organizing committees in North America, Asia, and
Australia ``because of his extensive friends and contacts in North
Africa,'' said Goodman. ``He knows a lot of people in that region.
He could be persuasive because he could say, `Hey, I'm a North
African, like you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Along with pitching for Salt Lake City and Sydney, El Farnawani
was able to advise Olympic Committee members about Islamic customs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe something as simple as telling them to be sure not to
serve pork to a Muslim, or that it would be a polite touch to make
sure there is a prayer rug in the hotel room,'' Goodman said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Toronto Star, he worked as an unpaid volunteer
for a Toronto group that tried unsucessfully to win the 1996
Olympics for that city, and more recently was briefly a paid
consultant for Toronto's effort to secure the 2008 Games.

SENATOR DRAFTS CLINTON CENSURE RESOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHRISTOPHER MATTHEWS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said Tuesday that
she had drafted a resolution to censure President Clinton for
official misconduct in his intimate relationship with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal condemns the president both for having the affair
and then concealing it from the nation, his cabinet and other
government officials.
</P>
<P>
   It does not deal with the legal question of perjury or
obstruction of justice _ the basis for the impeachment charges
approved by the House of Representatives _ but instead focuses on
presidential misconduct. The resolution neither clears the
president of criminal behavior nor implicates him.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said she had been given assurances by Senate leaders
that Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., will take up her
resolution following final Senate action on the two articles of
impeachment now being tried.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trent Lott has agreed to the introduction of the censure
resolution,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the proposed measure would be considered as a simple
Senate resolution, one that does not require a vote by the House or
the president's signature. It would need a simple majority in the
Senate to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein, who has emerged as a quiet voice of conscience on the
year-long scandal, has been known to be preparing such a censure
resolution but had not made it public.
</P>
<P>
   The draft appeared ready for formal introduction to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein expressed hope that her draft proposal would attract
the support of both liberal and conservative senators as well as
those closer to the political center.
</P>
<P>
   Having Feinstein's name attached to the proposed censure
resolution is expected to carry weight with fellow senators. In the
past, she has publicly expressed her disappointment with the
president. When Clinton made his denial to the country a year ago
about his relations with ``that woman, Ms. Lewinsky,'' Feinstein
was sitting in the same White House meeting room.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said Tuesday that the chances for
passage of a censure resolution would depend on the timing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sooner this ends, the more likely there'd be a censure,''
she said. While attractive as an ``alternative'' to removing the
president from office, she said, a resolution of censure ``loses
its glamour if we get it as an afterthought.''

   HAVANA _ An imposing structure from the outside, the Ameijeiras
Brothers Hospital is Havana's premier healthcare facility and one
of the few high-rise buildings positioned along this city's famed
seaside boulevard, the Malecon.
</P>
<P>
   But, inside, the facility is much-less impressive.
</P>
<P>
   The lights are off in the spacious, but darkened, lobby, and the
air-conditioning isn't working in most parts of the building. In
operating rooms, surgical gloves are generally reused. Everywhere,
antibiotics are in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors are so underpaid that some are contemplating leaving
their fields altogether to work instead in the tourism industry,
where they can earn more from foreigners in daily tips than they
can from the government in monthly incomes.
</P>
<P>
   Here, there's even a running joke about a woman who frets to a
psychiatrist that her husband suffers from delusions of grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   ``He keeps claiming to be a waiter, when everybody knows he's
only a brain surgeon,'' she worries.
</P>
<P>
   The average yearly salary for a doctor in Cuba is about $240.
</P>
<P>
   The ails of the Ameijeiras Brothers Hospital are a microcosm of
the ails afflicting this island's once world-renowned healthcare
system.
</P>
<P>
   Once the shining jewel of President Fidel Castro's revolution,
Cubans have seen their benefits flit away like leaves on an autumn
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many shortages that people try to avoid going to
the hospitals in Cuba at all costs because of all the problems that
exist in them,'' said Max Castro, an expert on Cuba at the
University of Miami's North-South Center.
</P>
<P>
   At many of Cuba's 273 hospitals, surgeons use acupuncture
instead of anesthesia during operations. Patients supply their own
food and bed sheets. Aspirin is scarce.
</P>
<P>
   Cubans blame deficiencies on the U.S. economic embargo, which
has made it increasingly hard -- and expensive -- to import
desperately needed medicines and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Recent takeovers of non-American pharmaceutical and other
medical companies by U.S.-based ones have made it even more
difficult to import medicines and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Existing U.S. embargo regulations permit only the licensed sale
and donation of medicines to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``It costs three times as much to buy medicines from other
sources than it would if we could buy them from the United States,
so we can't afford them,'' said Dr. Bartolome Arce Hidalgo, vice
director at the Ameijeiras Brothers Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have faced a lot of difficulties due to the blockade,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of U.S. policy toward Cuba, such as Sen. Christopher
Dodd, D-Conn., argue that U.S. licensing regulations are
prohibitive, and they want the embargo on medical sales lifted
completely.
</P>
<P>
   Within the next few months, Dodd plans to revise and
re-introduce legislation that failed to win approval last year
allowing for unencumbered medical-related sales to this communist
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time, we hope to have even more than the 29 co-sponsors
we had before,'' said Laura Sheehan, a spokeswoman for Dodd.
</P>
<P>
   But many Clinton administration officials blame Cuba's
foundering healthcare system not on the stifling U.S. embargo, but
on Cuba's foundering socialist economy, which they say is in worse
shape today than it was in 1959, when Castro took power.
</P>
<P>
   They retort that Cuba simply doesn't have the hard currency it
needs to make major purchases of medicines.
</P>
<P>
   With the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Cuba lost 85 percent
of its export market, forcing it to cut spending on healthcare by
between 70 and 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In a step some Cuba experts saw as ground-breaking under the
existing embargo, the Clinton administration late last year gave a
small Denver-based medical company permission to test a new product
in Cuba. Cuban officials are currently conducting a three-month
test of a needle-free vaccine injector developed by Genesis Medical
Technologies Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the first U.S. company that's been allowed to go in and
make our presence known in such a way,'' said Robert Jones, the
company's president. ``It's been good for us because preliminary
reports show the Cubans are impressed with the inoculation.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact Cuba's healthcare system still functions as well as it
does in the face of massive budget cuts is testament to how strong
its foundation was in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba has long been known for impressive strides in public
health. Its 63,000 doctors have eradicated most common infectious
diseases, such as measles and tuberculosis, and the average life
expectancy here is 75 years, same as in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Most medicines and treatments -- even plastic surgery -- are
made free of charge to Cuba's 12 million or so people.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba still has more doctors per capita -- one for every 185
citizens -- than any country in the developing world.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba even exports some of its doctors, with 1,000 physicians now
working abroad, including more than 400 in South Africa's grossly
under-serviced rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most importantly for Cuba's esteem is that the state-run
biotechnology industry is still breaking new ground. Recently,
Cuban scientists expressed hope that this will find vaccines for
AIDS and some types of cancer within the next seven years or so.
Health Minister Carlos Dotres has been even more optimistic, saying
in December that an AIDS vaccine would be ready within two or three
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biotechnology industry is still a very gung-ho industry,
and Cuba seems to have an army of engineers and scientists at work
in this area,'' said Florentino Chacon Puig, who works here for the
United Nations Development Program.
</P>
<P>
   He said scientists already have developed a vaccine for
meningitis C, one of the last childhood killers, and are working on
a vaccine to fight cholera.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, despite Cuba's shortages, doctors at the Ameijeiras
Brothers Hospital have performed 94 heart transplants over the last
10 years, as well as cornea, kidney, and bone marrow transplants,
advanced procedures unavailable in many other developing countries.
In the hospital's basement, doctors use four hyperbaric chambers --
that are worth $45,000 a piece -- to treat patients with all sorts
of common and acute conditions using concentrated levels of oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every hospital room is equipped with a television and
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows).
</P>
<P>
   But the hospital still needs sutures, anesthetics, and drugs
such as the cancer-fighting Tamoxifin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get Tamoxifin from China, so you can imagine how
expensive it is,'' said pharmacist Robin Garcia, referring to high
transportation costs.
</P>
<P>
   The dire need for foreign exchange in recent years has led many
of Cuba's better hospitals to market some of their beds to foreign
patients, who now pay $20 million a year in hard currency for
various treatments, according to Cuban government estimates.
</P>
<P>
   But Cuban government officials say no more than 5 percent of
hospital beds is set aside for foreigners so that there's still
plenty of space for Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1,000-bed Ameijeiras Brothers Hospital, only 50 beds are
reserved for foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money that's collected is devoted entirely to keeping the
rest of the health-care system alive,'' said government spokesman
Roberto de Armas.
</P>
<P>
   Still, anti-Castro critics blast Cuban hospitals for treating
foreigners with ample supplies of food and medicines.
</P>
<P>
   ``How is it that foreigners are treated with the best care and
the best drugs when the average Cuban must suffer from extreme
shortages?'' asked an angry Frank Calzon, director of the
non-profit Center for a Free Cuba in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   But Armas said hospitals must provide foreigners with good care
because their money is the glue that holds the entire health-care
system together.
</P>
<P>
   ``At our hospitals, the material conditions have deteriorated --
the beds are old and the paint is peeling,'' he said. ``But every
bed and every hospital is still open and the equipment still works,
and that's saying something.''

 &HT;    BACK TO BEIRUT: AMERICANS TRICKLING INTO ONE-TIME HAVEN FOR
HOSTAGE-TAKERS
 &HT;    With Photos in the International folder on the Cox Server.
 &HT;    For Use Sat., Jan. 30 And Thereafter.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ Like other college freshmen, American Cara
MacAdam goes to class, gets visits from her mother, and relaxes at
local pubs after a day full of classes.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 1980s, during the country's 15-year civil war, her
school was targeted for kidnappings and assassinations. In those
days, the American University in Beirut was no place for Americans.
</P>
<P>
   MacAdam is one of just a couple hundred Americans who, after the
lifting of a U.S. ban on travel to Lebanon, choose to live in the
war-scarred country.
</P>
<P>
   MacAdam, 18, was here as a toddler when her father was on the
AUB faculty. By the time she left in 1984, Lebanon's civil war had
turned against Americans and AUB took a lot of losses.
</P>
<P>
   One president of the university, David Dodge, was kidnapped and
another, Malcolm Kerr, was assassinated. An engineering professor
and hospital administrator were kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
   Radical groups pulled Americans and other foreigners off the
streets, including reporter Terry Anderson, Rev. Benjamin Weir and
hostage negotiator Terry Waite.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, the U.S. State Department outlawed travel to Lebanon by
Americans. During the ban, thousands of Americans managed to go
anyway, careful to keep Lebanese border stamps out of the their
passports. Mostly, though, they were Lebanese-Americans or people
married to Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the university, once with a majority-American student
body, lost its American students and faculty.
</P>
<P>
   In July, 1997(CQ), the state department lifted the ban, citing
progress in ``restoring order.'' A travel advisory still warns
Americans not to go to Lebanon without ``compelling reasons'' and
notes that someone fired a rocket-propelled grenade into the
embassy grounds in June.
</P>
<P>
   But Americans are trickling back in. There are scores there now,
though probably less than 200.
</P>
<P>
   There's the manager at the TGIFridays, some business executives,
the occasional journalist and a small group at the at the
136-year-old university _ nine students among the 5,000 enrolled
and about five faculty.
</P>
<P>
   The campus of green lawns and giant Banyan trees is an enclave
of quiet in the traffic-jammed Beirut downtown. From its hilltop,
it overlooks the Mediterranean and it has its own beach. While
Beirut still has entire blocks of bombed-out buildings, the damage
at AUB has been repaired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a part of my past that I don't even know,'' says
MacAdam, who was too young to remember Beirut when she left.
</P>
<P>
   Her friends in Princeton, N.J., wondered why she did not go to
school in the United States, but she was bored there. She said her
Lebanese peers wonder, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely an element of, 'What are you doing here,'''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   There is still a heavy military presence. On the streets of
Beirut, one sees propaganda from the radical Hezbollah, troops from
the Lebanese army and machine gun-toting secret service from Syria,
which exercises control over Lebanon. Southern Lebanon is occupied
by Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've sort of gotten used to Israeli jets breaking the sound
barrier. Initially, it was very disturbing,'' says student Kevin
DeJesus, from Providence, R.I., referring to a recent string of
Israeli fly-overs that created window-shaking sonic booms.
</P>
<P>
   But, the kidnappings stopped long ago and there is almost no
common street crime in Beirut. Bars and restaurants are popping up
in the rebuilt-downtown.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Beirut is probably the most liberal Arab capital. DeJesus, 28,
enjoys a disco called ``Acid.'' But, he says the two earrings he
wears -- both in one ear -- are still a ``source of discontent to
many.''
</P>
<P>
   History professor John Miloy(CQ), from California, said any
danger he might face is nothing compared to what Lebanese faced
during the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who decided every day whether to send their
kids to school or whether to cancel a lecture because a shell
landed nearby,'' says Miloy, 39.
</P>
<P>
   American Monte Palmer, 64, heads the school's Center for Arab
and Middle Eastern Studies. He was in Beirut in the 1970s, and
returned last year from Florida State University in Tallahassee,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   He's irked to see some of the changes, including a McDonald's
now downtown. He is careful about where he travels, but does not
fear for his safety and he recently talked to former hostage
Anderson about bringing a group of American journalism students to
the school this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon, though fragile, seems to be getting back on its feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I think Beirut is the best kept secret in the
world,'' he says. ``My assessment was that if things are going to
break down, there will be ample time to leave.''

</P>
<P>
   At the 1,000-bed Ameijeiras Brothers Hospital, only 50 beds are
reserved for foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money that's collected is devoted entirely to keeping the
rest of the health-care system alive,'' said government spokesman
Roberto de Armas.
</P>
<P>
   Still, anti-Castro critics blast Cuban hospitals for treating
foreigners with ample supplies of food and medicines.
</P>
<P>
   ``How is it that foreigners are treated with the best care and
the best drugs when the average Cuban must suffer from extreme
shortages?'' asked an angry Frank Calzon, director of the
non-profit Center for a Free Cuba in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   But Armas said hospitals must provide foreigners with good care
because their money is the glue that holds the entire health-care
system together.
</P>
<P>
   ``At our hospitals, the material conditions have deteriorated --
the beds are old and the paint is peeling,'' he said. ``But every
bed and every hospital is still open and the equipment still works,
and that's saying something.''

<P>
   (ATTN: Commentary Editors) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BEIRUT _ Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown. Until last
week, Crown Prince Hassan thought he wore one. Until today
(Tuesday), his brother King Hussein might have expected a few more
months upon the throne; but every Jordanian knew the significance
of the monarch's sudden flight back to America Tuesday. The king is
dying, his final battle with lymphoma cancer nearing its end.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Amman _ in a royal palace where shock is said to emanate
from every face _ Abdullah, the new crown prince and eldest son of
the king, is hourly expected to be made regent.
</P>
<P>
   There is indeed something Shakespearean about Hussein's
departure. We may occasionally have made light of the Plucky Little
King, but now he has disgraced the cozy, avuncular figure of his
younger brother Hassan with a speed that would have been the envy
of any Tudor... &QL;

THE DAY JOE NAMATH CHANGED THE FOOTBALL WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They don't make guarantees the way they used to.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it: Joe Namath ruined it for every subsequent athlete
who wanted to make a name with a bold promise or brash prediction.
</P>
<P>
   Because, really, who can ever come along and top the
show-stopping act of Namath? Who could approach the cool of Namath
lounging in front of a swimming pool at a Florida hotel in 1969,
days before the biggest game of his life, seemingly without a scare
in the world? Who could upstage Namath, the way he led a team of
sacrificial American Football League lambs _ known to next-of-kin
as the New York Jets _ into Super Bowl slaughterhouse III?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jets will win on Sunday. I guarantee it.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke those words three nights before the Super Bowl, at a
Miami Touchdown Club banquet honoring him as professional
football's player of the year. With the flourish of John Hancock
putting his name on the Declaration of Independence, Namath put his
signature on the American sporting scene in general and the Super
Bowl in particular.
</P>
<P>
   Talk _ and we do mean talk, which in those days was cheaper than
Jack Benny _ about handing your enemies a chain saw and then
climbing out on a limb. The Jets over the Baltimore Colts? When
pigs wear lipstick, and politicians make good on campaign promises.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts, befitting their status as the pride and joy of the
National Football League, were enjoying favored-franchise status.
The betting line started at 17 points, swelled to 19 and continued
to rise like Miami temperatures in July.
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, Namath put his mouth where the betting money was
in a moment of weakness. Namath lost the cool he had been so
careful to put on display for the world to see. He certainly hadn't
bothered to consult first with his teammates, or his coaches, or a
battery of image consultants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two weeks we were being told how we were going to lose the
game,'' Namath said. ``I don't care whether you're at the lower end
of Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, or you're with the New York Jets.
When you keep hearing your team isn't going to win, you get angry
and frustrated. The anger festers. Anger is a good thing to have
when you're playing some sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, the Jets had plenty of anger. They were angry at being
taken more lightly than a blonde at a MENSA convention. They were
angry at their quarterback for taking the chance of awakening a
slumbering giant of a 15-1 team. They undoubtedly would have been
angry to know that three decades would pass without them getting to
the Super Bowl again.
</P>
<P>
   Jets coach Weeb Ewbank pulled Namath aside and asked, in effect,
``ARE YOU CRAZY?''
</P>
<P>
   Namath puts tackle Dave Herman in the category of Jets who
``wanted to choke me.'' Herman had the assignment of handling Bubba
Smith, the Colts' fire-breathing, quarterback-eating defensive end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two or three times in the meetings during the week leading up
to it, it was expressed in there that, `You might want to shut this
off; we could get overconfident watching this,''' Herman said.
``But that was conversation inside the four walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then Joe went out and said quite innocently, `I guarantee
we're going to win.' I went up and said, `I've got a guy 6-8, 320
pounds. We don't need to excite him any more than he's going to
be.'''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the Colts took Namath and the Jets about as
seriously as a teen-ager takes a talk about the birds and the bees.
``All we did was laugh,'' Colts Hall-of-Fame tight end John Mackey
said. ``We thought it was a joke. And that was the problem. We had
the wrong attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colts considered themselves the substantive alternative to
Namath's style. Namath had the $400,000 contract and the white
cleats and the East Side penthouse with the llama rug. He liked
long-legged women and longer nights out on the town. He was the
leader of a new breed of athlete, and the establishment wasn't
ready to embrace him as a change for the better. Still, athletes
who prided themselves for being square enough to be divisible by
four soon found themselves on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy sex as much as Joe Namath,'' straight-arrow Roger
Staubach once said, in a sound-bite Hall of Fame moment. ``Only I
do it with one girl.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colts, for their part, had two quarterbacks who wore
crewcuts and black high tops. Their Hall-of-Fame-bound quarterback,
John Unitas, shredded his right elbow in the final game of the 1968
preseason. Coach Don Shula simply plugged in journeyman Earl
Morrall, who lit up opposing defenses for an NFL-leading 26
touchdown passes.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Colts were so overwhelming, they could make a league
Most Valuable Player out of a backup They sure weren't about to
worry themselves about a cocky 25-year-old quarterback with a mouth
big enough to stuff two feet into.
</P>
<P>
   Colts owner Carroll Rosenbloom arranged for the players'
families to make the trip to Miami. Super Bowl week had the feel of
a working vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the biggest mistake was that we believed we were a
19-point favorite,'' Mackey said. ``We just believed all we had to
do was show up. We had announced the victory party the Wednesday
before and cut up the winners' share at the pre-game meal. Now, can
you believe that?''
</P>
<P>
   Believe this: Morrall took the Colts on six first-half drives in
Super Bowl III. Two ended with missed field goals. Three ended with
interceptions inside the Jets' 15 yard-line. None ended with
points.
</P>
<P>
   The play that has the Colts and their fans shaking their heads
to this day came in the final minute of the half. With the score
7-0, Jets, and the ball on the Jets' 41, receiver Jimmy Orr got
wide open in the end zone on a flea-flicker. For some reason,
Morrall never spotted Orr. Safety Jim Hudson picked off a pass over
the middle intended for Jerry Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The desperation of a 13-0 deficit called for the measure of
Shula bringing a rusty, limp-armed Unitas into the game. Less than
four minutes of the third quarter remained. The score was 16-0
before Unitas got around to taking the Colts into the end zone.
Less than four minutes of the fourth quarter remained. The Colts
recovered an onside kick and drove inside the Jets' 20. The Jets'
defense held up one last time.
</P>
<P>
   It ended Jets 16, Colts 7. A crowd of 75,377 paid $12 a ticket
to see the game that announcer Curt Gowdy calls ``the most
financially important game that has ever been done in this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Namath foiled the Colts' blitz all day, completing 17-of-28
passes for 206 yards. Matt Snell ran through the Colts for 121
yards and scored the only Jets' touchdown. The Jets forced five
turnovers and didn't bother throwing a pass the entire fourth
quarter. Just like that, the AFL had credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``That changed the whole thinking of the sportsman's mind,''
said Gowdy, who did the Super Bowl III play-by-play for NBC. ``Most
guys were, `Ah, that AFL, who are they?' Like the AFL players came
from upper Slobovia and the NFL players came from the colleges. You
couldn't tell 'em the AFL was getting better every year until the
Jets beat Baltimore. The next year, Kansas City beat Minnesota
soundly (23-7 in Super Bowl IV). Suddenly, everybody was, `Hey,
it's all over now. The AFL is as good as the NFL.'''
</P>
<P>
   They don't make guarantees the way they used to. They can't. Joe
Namath guaranteed the impossible and delivered.

SMASHED, NOT MASHED, POTATOES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MOLLY O'NEILL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Smashed potatoes, as opposed to mashed potatoes, could almost be
called a natural phenomenon. They appear to be hand-hewed and
unprocessed, seemingly at odds with a technological age. Yet,
smashed potatoes can also be viewed as a victory of the pro-lumpers
over the anti-lumpers, a triumph of the slap-dash over the careful.
</P>
<P>
   Smashing _ roughly mushing a baked or boiled potato with a fork
or wire masher _ reverses this country's 200-year trajectory toward
fluffy, creamy potatoes. Smashing generally leaves potato skin,
flakes and lumps intact and deploys olive oil or cooking juices as
often as it does butter or cream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, you give the potato a good kick in the pants and
send it to the plate,'' said Peter Hoffman, the chef and owner of
Savoy restaurant in Manhattan. The results? An innocent,
warts-and-all potato, nothing gussied up or airbrushed.
</P>
<P>
   Chefs like Hoffman like it that way, and they are not alone.
Smashed potatoes are chic and are appearing in some of the best
restaurants in town _ and in some of the finest homes.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Guarnaschelli, the editor of the 1997 revision of ``Joy of
Cooking,'' said the rising popularity of the smashed potato fits
the natural, unprocessed, healthy, low-fat style of eating in
America today. For the first time in its 65-year run, the current
edition of ``Joy'' contains a recipe for smashed potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   The starchy Idaho, Russet Burbank or large Yukon Gold potato are
great in mashed and smashed potatoes alike, but smashing allows the
use of waxier varieties like the tiny fingerling and also heirloom
varieties, which become gluey when subjected to a ricer or
hand-held mixer.
</P>
<P>
   Baking most varieties is the simplest way to get a good texture
and a toasty flavor. The fingerlings or heirloom varieties can be
baked, boiled or steamed in their skins.
</P>
<P>
   While a simple fork or the side of a heavy knife can smash
potatoes nicely, a beloved tool in professional kitchens is a thick
serpentine-shaped mashing wire with a heavy-gauge stainless steel
handle. This smasher, which looks like the hand mashers that were
popular in the early part of this century, is a perfectly balanced
tool that allows the cook to retain lumps or banish them as the
mood fits.
</P>
<P>
   Made by Best Manufacturers in Portland, Ore., it comes in 8-,
10- and 11-inch sizes; Broadway Panhandler (477 Broome Street, near
Wooster Street) has them for $6.95, $9.95 and $14.95. Dean &AMP; DeLuca
(560 Broadway, at Prince Street) has the 8-inch size for $7.50 and
the 11-inch for $15.
</P>
<P>
   But the story of smashed potatoes is not merely one of technique
and technology. How a given era treats its potatoes always reveals
current culinary ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   In charting the potato's progress in America, steadily rising
levels of butter, milk and cream separate the mashed from the
whipped, the creamed from the pureed. Technological innovation also
seems to point to ``fluffy'' as manifest destiny, said Karen Hess,
a scholar of Early American cookbooks and, with her husband, John,
the author of ``The Taste of America,'' (University of South
Carolina Press, 1989).
</P>
<P>
   The smooth, rich form reached its peak with the invention of the
hand-held electric mixer. A pamphlet issued by the Sunbeam-Oster
Co. in 1933 depicts mounds of whipped potatoes that look like
cumulus clouds. Whipped potatoes were also highest on the richness
scale, containing up to three tablespoons of milk or cream and one
tablespoon of butter per potato.
</P>
<P>
   Directly beneath whipped potatoes, creamed potatoes contain
three-quarters of a cup of milk and one tablespoon of butter per
potato. Mashed potatoes contain one tablespoon of cream and
one-half tablespoon of butter per potato.
</P>
<P>
   Smashed potatoes initially appear to be less decadent. They have
a lot of texture, and for this reason chefs tend to pair smashed
potatoes with rich meat dishes, while reserving the unctuous mashed
or whipped potato for seafood and more delicate meats.
</P>
<P>
   But the spare and humble versions served at the Union Square
Cafe and Le Bernardin are already giving way to more luxurious
forms. At Gramercy Tavern, Tom Colicchio smashes potatoes with
everything from foie gras to cod. Terrance Brennan at Picholine
serves a smashed potato with copious amounts of truffle butter,
topped with shaved truffle.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, no sooner does ``smashed'' become a code word
for ``healthy, pure and lean'' than the dish starts getting bigger,
richer and more expensive. The conceit is humble; the price tag is
another story. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons butter
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Chopped fresh herbs (optional). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Place the potatoes in a large pot, and add enough cool water
to cover by one inch. Add 1 teaspoon of salt for each quart of
water. Cover, bring to a boil, and cook until tender when pierced
with a knife tip, 20 to 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   2. Drain the potatoes, and remove them from the pot. Cool
slightly, about 5 minutes. On a flat work surface, whack each
potato once or twice with the flat- side of a large knife or the
back of a plate; the potatoes should pretty much retain their
original shape. Divide potatoes among four plates, and top with
butter, salt, and if desired, a few grinds of pepper and, if
desired, herbs. Serve hot.

<P>
   Time: 40 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   12 ounces fingerling potatoes
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons finely chopped black truffle, plus 12 paper-thin
slices (about 2{ ounces in all)
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature, cut into pieces
</P>
<P>
   Coarse sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Toss the fingerlings with
olive oil, place them on a baking sheet, and bake until they can be
easily pierced with a fork, about 22 minutes. Remove from the oven,
and cool.
</P>
<P>
   2. When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, remove the skins
with a paring knife. Transfer the potatoes to a bowl, and add the
chopped truffle and butter. Roughly crush the potatoes, using a
serpentine-style masher. Switch to a fork or a slotted spoon, and
continue to smash and fluff the potatoes until the butter and
chopped truffle are all incorporated, but they should retain a
rough texture. Add salt and pepper to taste.
</P>
<P>
   3. Divide the potatoes among four plates, garnish with three
truffle slices each, and serve hot.

KEEPING THE HEAT LOW FOR POACHED FISH FILLETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thin fish fillets can be tricky, mostly because they fall apart
the instant they're overcooked. But the fact that
quarter-inch-thick fillets of flounder, sole and other flatfish
take so little time to cook can be turned to your advantage.
</P>
<P>
   By poaching them in barely hot liquid, you slow the process and
gain control. By flavoring the liquid first with a quick-cooking
aromatic vegetable, you create a comforting, warming dish that
needs only bread or rice to become a meal. By contrast to what
happens with broiling or sauteing, the fish never dries out.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional liquid for poaching fish is court-bouillon, a
stock made from scratch using fish bones, onions, carrots and
celery and enhanced with white wine and herbs. Assuming you don't
have any on hand _ and who does? _ the poaching liquid of choice is
chicken stock.
</P>
<P>
   The usually insipid canned variety is fine, because you're going
to add flavor to it, and quickly.
</P>
<P>
   This recipe requires 15 minutes or less from start to finish.
While the stock comes to a boil and reduces by about half, you
clean and chop some leeks, adding them to the liquid as they're
ready. A couple of minutes later, you season the broth and add the
fillets.
</P>
<P>
   The subsequent cooking time depends largely on your equipment.
If you have an electric stove, you can simply turn the heat off;
the element will remain warm enough to cook the fish. You may need
a low flame with a gas stove, but it should be the minimum. A
heavy-duty pan may retain enough heat to make even that
unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   Poaching fish with this method presents dozens of options, all
of which are as simple as changing the seasonings. You can use
other aromatic vegetables, like shallots, onions, scallions,
garlic, carrots and celery, alone or in combination. (Cut carrots
into small pieces so they'll cook quickly.) Or try herbs,
especially parsley, chervil or dill, and spices, alone or in
combination.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a North African-style combination of a few
coriander seeds, a small piece of cinnamon and a little cumin is
easily assembled and appealing.
</P>
<P>
   You can also use this technique for thicker fillets, like red
snapper, sea bass or cod.
</P>
<P>
   After you cover the skillet, keep the heat on low and, after
about six minutes, check the fish every minute. When the tip of a
thin-blade knife inserted into the fish encounters no resistance,
the fish is done. If it begins to flake, it's overdone _ but only
slightly, and it will still be juicy. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FISH POACHED IN BROTH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 15 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About 2 cups chicken stock (or 1 can containing 14 or 15 ounces)
</P>
<P>
   3 1-inch-thick leeks
</P>
<P>
   Coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1{ pounds flounder or other thin fillets. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Place the stock in a large skillet that can be covered, and
turn the heat to high. Let the stock boil and reduce by about half
while you prepare the leeks. Trim off leek roots and green ends;
cut the white part in half the long way, and rinse thoroughly. Chop
each half into semicircles [ to \ inch thick, adding them to the
boiling broth as you cut them.
</P>
<P>
   2. When all the leeks are added, cook a minute longer. Add salt
and pepper to taste, and stir; then add the fish. Cover, and turn
off the heat, or keep the heat at an absolute minimum. Uncover and
check the fish after 3 minutes; it is done when the tip of a
thin-blade knife inserted into the flesh encounters no resistance.
Continue to check every minute until the fish is done.
</P>
<P>
   3. Serve the fish with the leeks and some broth spooned over it;
top all with a sprinkling of coarse salt.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

 (HLW)  
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the Swedish mezzo-soprano Anne Sofie von Otter
was a young girl, she knew nothing about classical music and cared
less. ``I couldn't tell the difference between Bach and Mahler,''
Ms. von Otter said recently.
</P>
<P>
   She took the obligatory piano lessons that children from
comfortable homes are usually subjected to: her father was a
diplomat. But the music that spoke to her was pop and rock, the
Beatles, most of all, but also Cat Stevens, Judy Collins and
Crosby, Stills and Nash. It was ``the nice tidy'' pop, she
explained. ``The Rolling Stones were not for me.'' Later, a friend
introduced her to fusion jazz, which she thought very daring at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   She loved ballet, however, especially the Tchaikovsky ballets
she attended in Stockholm, her birthplace, and London, where her
father was the Swedish consul-general for five years during her
childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ardently wanted to a be a ballerina,'' she said. ``I took
dance classes and had dreams. I was terribly disappointed when I
realized that I could not do it.'' She wasn't drawn into singing
until her last two years of high school in Sweden, when a dashing
music teacher took over the chorus, and she just had to join up.
</P>
<P>
   Though Ms. von Otter's story of coming late to singing is not
uncommon, it is striking given her probing intelligence and
sensitive musicianship, qualities usually associated with singers
who have trained seriously from an early age. She clearly made up
for lost time, attending Stockholm Conservatory and later spending
a year at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London. But by
starting late, she at least did not prematurely push her naturally
warm, dusky-toned lyric voice.
</P>
<P>
   Now 43, she would seem to be at her peak, a compelling artist
who brings a wide range of colors and nuanced shadings to her
interpretations and who likes to explore unusual repertory. The
series she has been presenting at Alice Tully Hall with the Chamber
Music Society of Lincoln Center, a mix of songs with piano, songs
with instrumental accompaniment and chamber works, is typical of
repertory forays.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday's concert was devoted to music of Erich Wolfgang
Korngold, the Austrian composer, born in 1897, who jettisoned his
early modernism as he developed, eventually becoming an
award-winning composer of Hollywood film scores. On Sunday, the
program focused on French music, including Faure's sublime ``La
Bonne Chanson.'' Wednesday night's program presents mostly music
from Scandinavia, including a seldom-heard song cycle by Grieg,
``Haugtussa,'' plus songs by Swedish composers and by Sibelius, a
Finn.
</P>
<P>
   Through her perseverance and artistry, Ms. von Otter has won a
loyal following among song enthusiasts. She is also a sought-after
singer of the orchestral song repertory. But she has not had
equivalent opportunities in opera, she said. ``I'm not known as an
opera singer, an opera star,'' she said. ``I wish my repertory were
larger. But there is so little to choose from that is right for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. von Otter is being somewhat modest in describing her
repertory as limited. She has sung many roles memorably, including
Mozart's Cherubino, Dorabella and Sesto, Strauss' Octavian (one of
her notable achievements), as well as roles in works by Monteverdi,
Gluck, Handel and other Baroque composers.
</P>
<P>
   And although on one occasion she sang Rossini's ``Cenerentola,''
Cecilia Bartoli's signature role, Ms. von Otter has not been part
of the current bel canto boomlet, driven, it would seem, by a whole
contingent of mezzo-sopranos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rossini is not for me,'' she said. ``I can enjoy a Rossini
opera. But to stand there in my room, with a Rossini score in front
of me, with all those notes, and have to learn it: it doesn't do
anything for me.'' And, she added, there are other mezzos, like Ms.
Bartoli and Jennifer Larmore, who have the alchemy to turn those
Rossinian roulades into something exciting. So why should she
compete?
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ms. von Otter is considering one touchstone role for which
there is ample competition: Bizet's Carmen. She has sung the role
once in concert but not yet on the opera stage. ``I'm not an
obvious Carmen,'' she said. Carmen is a hot-blooded, willful
Spanish gypsy. Ms. von Otter is a laconic, 6-foot-tall, wholesomely
attractive blonde Scandinavian. ``I would have to be costumed
right,'' she added wryly.
</P>
<P>
   When she tried the role in concert, she wanted her portrayal to
be as far removed from the standard hip-swiveling, seductive
routine as possible. ``But you end up doing it anyway,'' she said,
shimmying a little bit in her chair. ``You can't help it. It's in
the music.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Ms. von Otter's repertory adventures have been suggested
to her by a longtime collaborator, the pianist Bengt Forsberg, the
artistic adviser for Ms. von Otter's current series with the
Chamber Music Society. ``We are real partners,'' she said of
Forsberg. ``I never say to Bengt, `This is what we are doing, go
home and learn it.' We spend hours reading through music,
suggesting things to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Forsberg is responsible for engaging Ms. von Otter's interest in
Korngold. The latest of their Deutsche Grammophon recordings is a
two-disk program of that composer's songs and chamber works. They
are both eager to talk about why Korngold has been so overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``There he was, a composer born over 25 years after
Schoenberg,'' Forsberg said. ``Yet the music sounds so Romantic,
lush and extravagant. But if you listen carefully, there is
dissonance, fantastic harmonies, a constant ebb and flow.'' And, he
added, Ms. von Otter sings it ideally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Korngold takes great technical finesse,'' Ms. von Otter
explained, ``but also great heart, and lots of schmaltz.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. von Otter's schmaltz is kept from being smothering by her
cool-headedness. Is this a stereotypical Swedish trait?
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think we Swedes are slightly more reserved,'' she said.
``There is great passion in us, but not on the surface, as with the
South Europeans. You have to look a little more to see the passion.
We show less.''
</P>
<P>
   In a field crowded with emotive prima donnas, Ms. von Otter's
self-containment is refreshing. She saves her passion for her music
making, and saves herself for her personal life, especially her
family: her husband, Benny Fredriksson, a theater director, and her
two sons, 10 and 7.
</P>
<P>
   This is one reason she has been largely absent from the opera
company in her hometown, the Royal Opera in Stockholm. After some
performances there as Octavian in 1988, she did not sing with the
company again until last year, when she participated in the
premiere of a new opera by a Swedish composer, Sven David
Sandstrom.
</P>
<P>
   She sings recitals in Sweden, and performs with the chamber
ensemble run by Forsberg. But ``when I'm home, I like to be home,
to be able to put my children to bed,'' she said. ``If I am not
singing in the evening, I never work past 4 p.m. I try be away from
Sweden no more than six months per year.''
</P>
<P>
   She gives some 50 performances a year. She could easily accept
twice that number of bookings if she wanted to. She doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``When young singers ask me for advice, I say: `Don't accept
everything. Spend time at home. Keep your friends.' Or, as you say
in American, `Get a life!'''

   &UR; Salted Soybean Pods Seek a Niche in the Home &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Edamame, salted soybeans that are the equivalent of cocktail
peanuts in Asian restaurants, will soon be moving into home
kitchens. Karan Hall, a spokeswoman for one importer, Seaside Farms
of Inglewood, Calif., says the demand for the fresh soybeans has
risen fivefold nationally in the last six months.
</P>
<P>
   Nobu Next Door, Mirezi, Bop and other restaurants serve the
snack warm with drinks. Edamame, fresh soybeans that are boiled and
salted, are bright green and slightly fuzzy pods that should be
popped open; each contains about three plump, slightly sweet
legume-like seeds.

   &UR; Help for Fish Bones &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Fish bones are embarrassing to the cook and risky to the diner,
but now there is a cute gadget to help. Boneless Fish is basically
a bright plastic tweezer in the shape of a fish about four inches
long. Press the fins, and the mouth closes to seize a bone to be
pulled out. It will work on sauteed trout, smoked whitefish and
even on the annoying pin bones in fillets of raw salmon that are
supposed to be boneless.

</P>
<P>
   Dulce de leche is the Hispanic milk caramel that enjoys
well-deserved mainstream popularity _ witness the skyrocketing
sales of Haagen-Dazs' dulce de leche ice cream. In Mexico it is
often called cajeta and may be made with goat's milk. Now, in an
odd example of culinary cross-pollination, a company in Israel is
producing and selling jars of creamy dulce de leche to spoon over
ice cream or to use as a cake filling. What's next? Mexican
falafel?

MUSCOVADO SUGAR  
 BUGPROOFING THE KITCHEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MELISSA CLARK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have several recipes that call for muscovado sugar. What is
it, and where can I buy it?
</P>
<P>
   A. Muscovado is a minimally refined brown sugar similar to the
better-known Demerara and turbinado sugars. Unlike supermarket
brown sugar, which is refined white sugar darkened and flavored
with molasses, these sugars have not been stripped of their natural
molasses and therefore have distinctive, earthy flavors. They are
commonly known as raw sugars.
</P>
<P>
   The darkest and most intense of the three, muscovado has a
sticky, candylike texture and an intense, bittersweet taste
reminiscent of dark molasses and burnt-sugar caramel. In contrast,
Demerara and turbinado sugar both have a pale, sandy color, subtle
flavor, and free-flowing large sugar crystals.
</P>
<P>
   These two can be used interchangeably, though Demerara has a bit
more flavor. Turbinado, the lighter of the two in color and flavor,
is sold under the brand name Sugar in the Raw, and is commonly
offered as a substitute for white sugar at coffee bars.
</P>
<P>
   Recipes that focus on natural ingredients often call for one
type of raw sugar or another, so that a less processed sweetener
can be used.
</P>
<P>
   You can also substitute any of these sugars for supermarket
brown sugar in other recipes, although the flavor of the finished
dish will be more robust. Muscovado is especially nice mixed into
gingerbread, chutney and barbecue sauces, while turbinado and
Demerara are good to sprinkle over unbaked shortbread cookies for
an added crunch.
</P>
<P>
   Muscovado sugar, which is labeled as such, is available in many
health-food stores and specialty shops; it is available by mail
from La Cuisine (800-521-1176, $5 for a 1-pound bag). Demerara and
turbinado, often labeled simply ``raw sugar,'' are available in
health-food stores and large supermarkets.

   Q. Often packages of flour-based products (flour and pasta in
particular) that I bring home from the store are infested with
little bugs. In the case of flour, I have been throwing the entire
package out. For pasta, I have been boiling the contents and
skimming the dead bugs from the surface. I'm interested in any
health implications.
</P>
<P>
   A. Though some health professionals might argue that swallowing
a tiny bug or two won't harm you, it is best to get rid of
bug-infested products and try to make your kitchen as bugproof as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Insects usually invade food products in warehouses or stores,
not at the mill or manufacturing plant, especially if the product
is sold in bulk and is not tightly packaged.
</P>
<P>
   If food you have just bought contains bugs, throw it out or
return it to the store. If you discover bugs in your pantry, check
all containers holding flour, pasta, cereals, grains, dried fruits,
nuts, seeds, and even dry pet food, for pests. Discard any infested
products, and vacuum well (throw out the vacuum bag).
</P>
<P>
   If the infestation is particularly severe, you might also want
to use a pantry-safe insecticide spray or set out some natural
insect pheromone traps. You can buy both at Do-It-Yourself Pest
Control (www.pantrypest.com or 800-476-3368; $13.50 for the spray;
$5.95 for two traps).
</P>
<P>
   To keep cabinets pest-free, check any newly purchased product
well for bugs (especially if it is natural, organic or purchased in
bulk). If the product seemed clean when you brought it home and
later developed bugs, it was probably housing nearly invisible pest
eggs and larvae.
</P>
<P>
   Store all foods in your cabinets in tightly sealed containers or
jars, to prevent any bugs from spreading. Although some people
swear that adding a bay leaf to the jar deters bugs, I have never
found this to be true.

WINE OF THE WEEK  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Brajkovich Signature Series Kumeu River Chardonnay 1997, New
Zealand. About $15. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This is the least expensive of the Kumeu River chardonnays,
which makes it the ideal vehicle for getting acquainted with
chardonnays from New Zealand. At their best they are the antithesis
of the California style, which is big-bodied with lots of extract,
fruit and wood, not necessarily in that order. As befits their
chillier, maritime climate, the New Zealand chardonnays are no less
intense, but are often leaner bodied and a bit sharper on the
palate.
</P>
<P>
   This wine was made from purchased grapes grown in Kumeu, in the
Auckland region. The grapes were hand harvested rather than machine
picked and were fermented in oak barrels rather than in stainless
steel. The wine was bottled in December 1997 and has six months
more aging than a typical American chardonnay because of the
reversed seasons in the Southern Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   If you like this Kumeu chardonnay, you will love the winery's
estate-bottled Mate's Vineyard Chardonnay, named for Mate
Brajkovich, who founded Kumeu River in 1944. It is about $40.

 &HT;    POPE'S MESSAGE IN MEXICO COULD HAVE RADICAL EFFECT ON CLERGY
SERVING POOR
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (l) Lifestyle
categories.
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ He was supremely diplomatic and didn't publicly
refer once to the conflict between Zapatista Indian rebels and the
Mexican government.
</P>
<P>
   But Pope John Paul II's visit to Mexico -- where he denounced
widening economic inequality in the Americas -- could have a
radical effect on Mexican and Latin American clergy, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the pope left Mexico Tuesday morning, some clergy
were already rejoicing over homilies the Catholic leader had
delivered. The pope was in Mexico to outline the Vatican's vision
for the church in this hemisphere at the dawn of a new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be off the wall to think that the pope would come
here and talk about the Zapatista National Liberation Army. But
it's another thing for him to talk about just causes in the
universal sense,'' said Bishop Samuel Ruiz, speaking to Mexican
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz is a controversial figure in Mexico who presides over a
diocese in Chiapas state, where the Zapatista rebels are based.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz, excited about the pope's exhortation to protect the poor,
held a press conference in Mexico City on Monday, the day before
the pope departed for St. Louis, Mo., to meet with U.S. President
Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Ruiz has faced criticism from Catholic hierarchy
for his impassioned attacks on the Mexican government, which he
accuses of violating the rights of impoverished Indians.
</P>
<P>
   But the pope's speeches -- although mostly of a spiritual flavor
-- may benefit Ruiz and other like-minded clergy in Latin America,
said Oscar Aguilar, a Mexico City political consultant who has
studied the Catholic church.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pope's condemnation of poverty will help priests like
Ruiz,'' Aguilar said. ``But if you read the church documents on the
Americas (that were released in Mexico) you see that he also warns
them not to exclude anyone from the church.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The pope,'' Aguilar added, ``is very careful not to align
himself with any one side.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria Dolores Villagomez of Mexico City's Center for Ecumenical
Studies said the pope's messages were filled with enough spiritual
content to satisfy those who believe the church should stay out of
political life.
</P>
<P>
   But she agreed that some Catholics will feel they have the
pope's blessing to challenge government policies that are unjust.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that more priests will become involved in politics,''
Villagomez said. ``It's that priests will be encouraging lay people
to become involved in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it is losing members, the Catholic church remains a
powerful influence in Latin America, where most of the world's
Catholics live.
</P>
<P>
   The region also suffers from the biggest gap between rich and
poor on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the pope has become more outspoken about
inequality.
</P>
<P>
   During his five-day visit in Mexico the pontiff repeatedly
lashed out at new ``neo-liberal'' or free-market reforms that have
taken hold in Latin America and, he said, made some people poorer.
</P>
<P>
   While the pope avoided mentioning the Indian rebels in Chiapas,
he repeatedly expressed sympathy for Latin America's Indian
population.
</P>
<P>
   During the pope's visit, Mexicans were also surprised at the
tough speeches delivered by Cardinal Norberto Rivera of Mexico
City, who has a reputation for being conservative.
</P>
<P>
   At one public event, Rivera told the pope Mexico ``had been
deceived and invaded by poverty,'' words that made banner headlines
in newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were strong words because they came from him, not from
some union leader,'' said Aguilar.

TACKLING THESE BOWLS WILL SCORE SOUPER POINTS  
 (ADV: STORY INCLUDES TWO RECIPES)

 By JUDY WALKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Don't let a bad pun stop you from considering our
suggestion: Throw a Souper Bowl Party on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It's just familiar enough, and just different enough, that your
friends will love it. Last year, we invited a few people to bring
their favorite soups over and watch the game. Surprise! The game
was a really good one, and the soups were even better. Everybody
had a great time.
</P>
<P>
   For one of the most casual entertaining occasions on the year's
social calendar, you can't go wrong with soup. Consider it a
variant on the perennial favorite Super Bowl guy food, chili.
</P>
<P>
   Invite people to bring a soup, and let them know that it doesn't
need to be a huge amount, either, because if everybody brings
something, you'll have loads. Get a lot of sturdy plastic bowls and
spoons (disposable but recyclable), so everybody can have a fresh
bowl and spoon when they try a different soup.
</P>
<P>
   Hit the bakery for a bread assortment, make a batch of cornbread
and spread out some cheese and crackers.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to get really fancy, put out a variety of soup
condiments and let guests add their own embellishments: croutons,
oyster crackers, lemon or lime wedges, salsa, a bottle of hot
sauce, bacon bits, chopped chives, you name it.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver Broncos Black Bean Chili recipe is the one we served
last year, to great acclaim. It's simple, it's vegetarian if you
want it to be, low in fat and high in fiber, and you can put it in
a slow cooker. The Broncos are back in the Big One, and so is our
recipe. Chopped green onions, salsa and cheese are great add-ons.
</P>
<P>
   In perfect creamy counterpoint is Shrimp and Corn Chowder, which
is from James Villas' ``My Mother's Southern Kitchen.'' It is rich,
and because it's from the Georgia and Carolina Low Country, makes
abundant use of fresh shrimp. If you don't have a freezer full, try
cutting the shrimp amount in half. (And if you don't have bacon
grease _ another Southern staple _ use any kind of oil.) Be careful
not to overheat the soup or let it do more than just come to a boil
at the end.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the food! section we have sprinkled other soups for
your consideration. Tortilla Soup is always a favorite. You can
suggest these recipes to your guests, or ask them to bring their
own favorite soup.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be super. &QL;

   Shrimp and Corn Chowder
</P>
<P>
   (From ``My Mother's Southern Kitchen'' )
</P>
<P>
   6 cups strong fresh chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   3 pounds fresh shrimp, shelled and deveined
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons bacon grease
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon butter
</P>
<P>
   1 medium-size onion, minced
</P>
<P>
   2 celery ribs, minced
</P>
<P>
   1/2 large green bell pepper, seeded and minced
</P>
<P>
   8 ears fresh corn (about 4 cups kernels)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons arrowroot dissolved in 1 cup cold milk
</P>
<P>
   Salt and black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Tabasco sauce to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   2 carrots, scraped and sliced paper thin
</P>
<P>
   1/2 red bell pepper, seeded and cut into small dice
</P>
<P>
   4 slices bacon, fried crisp and crumbled
</P>
<P>
   Bring half the chicken stock to a boil in a large, heavy
saucepan, add the shrimp, return to a boil, remove from the heat,
and let stand 3 minutes. Reserve 24 or more shrimp, place the
remainder in a blender with the remaining cold stock and process,
till almost pureed, then add the liquefied shrimp to the hot stock.
</P>
<P>
   In a skillet, heat the bacon grease and butter, add the onion,
celery and green pepper, and cook over low heat about 3 minutes,
stirring. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Slit the corn kernels by running the tip of a sharp knife down
each row of kernels. With the back of the knife, scrape the pulp
and juice into a bowl. Add the corn pulp and juice to the shrimp
mixture, and cook over moderate heat 1 minute, stirring. Add the
cooked vegetables and arrowroot mixture, stir, bring to a brisk
boil, and cook 2 minutes. Remove from the heat, add the salt,
pepper and Tabasco, cover and let stand 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   When ready to serve, bring the chowder to a boil, add the cream,
carrots and red pepper, and stir well. Do not let it continue to
boil. Pour into wide soup bowls and add 4 to 6 shrimp that were
reserved plus a sprinkling of crumbled bacon to each portion.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 servings.

A WORTHY RHONE NEIGHBOR FOR HERMITAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's an American story, actually. A fellow becomes disillusioned
with the corporate grind and decides to change his life. He buys a
nice piece of ground, plants some vines and, presto change-o,
becomes a wine maker. In California, it seems that it happens every
other day.
</P>
<P>
   But Alain Graillot did it in France, where career changes are
considered subversive and midlife crises are often assuaged with a
new car or a girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Graillot was a 40-something salesman for an
agricultural business and had spent most of his working life on the
road. Some road _ one of his two sons was born in Guatemala and the
other in Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   He hated the life and he missed France. So he did what is almost
unthinkable there _ he chucked his job and went back to the Rhone
Valley, where he was born, to make wine. It was a courageous move.
It was also a smart one.
</P>
<P>
   He purchased some 50 acres in Crozes-Hermitage, most of it
planted 20 years earlier. Today he is one of the best known and
most respected winegrowers in the appellation _ and just when it is
beginning to gain a reputation for truly excellent Rhone wines.
</P>
<P>
   I say ``in the appellation'' because there is no community
called Crozes-Hermitage. It is a wine-producing region consisting
of 11 communes surrounding the town of Tain-l'Hermitage, which is
the source of a revered wine called simply Hermitage. One of those
11 communes, called Crozes, is where the Crozes-Hermitage
appellation was created in 1937.
</P>
<P>
   Until the 1980s, Crozes-Hermitage wines were decent but
unmemorable; better than most Cotes-du-Rhone, but not by much. In
the '60s, a drinkable Crozes-Hermitage sold in New York for $1.25
and it was a far cry from a great Hermitage.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the various communes in the Crozes-Hermitage
appellation display different soil and drainage characteristics.
The best locations are in the south _ east of the Rhone and north
of the Isere River. There, in the town of Pont-de-l'Isere, is the
Domaine les Chenes Verts (Green Oaks), Graillot's main vineyard and
his home.
</P>
<P>
   He also owns two small portions of a vineyard called Les
Greffieux, in Hermitage itself, and some four acres in St.-Joseph,
a large region across the river, on the west bank of the Rhone.
</P>
<P>
   All the communes I've mentioned are part of the Northern Rhone,
a wine region stretching about 60 miles from Ampuis (which is just
south of Lyons) to Valence. This is mostly red wine country, and
the grape, with few exceptions, is syrah. The white wines, which
can be surprisingly good, if a bit muscular compared with white
Burgundies, are made from the marsanne and roussanne grapes.
</P>
<P>
   I first met Graillot in late December, when he came to New York
to conduct a tasting of his wines at a dinner at the restaurant
Montrachet. In fact, he had to share the spotlight with wines from
one of his neighbors, Paul Jaboulet-Aine, one of the grand old
producers of the Rhone.
</P>
<P>
   A modest man, Graillot persists in downplaying his Hermitage: it
is not, he insisted, up to the quality he wants to display one day,
even though many of his vines are 80 years old. (A taste that
evening confirmed his judgement.) So that night, we drank his
favorite Crozes-Hermitage, wines he calls La Guiraude, from the
1994, 1992, 1990 and 1989 vintages.
</P>
<P>
   From a lack of a Graillot Hermitage, we drank La Chapelle, from
Paul Jaboulet-Aine from 1982 (in magnum), 1990, 1978 and 1961. By
the way, to provide a dinner to match these powerful wines,
Montrachet's chef, Remi Lauvand, created an all-truffle menu.
</P>
<P>
   The first wine called La Guiraude came from the 1985 vintage,
which was harvested just 15 days after Graillot took possession of
the place. La Guiraude is a blend with no particular geographic
orientation within the Graillot vineyards: it merely represents the
lots of wine that Graillot enjoys most from the year's crop. This
approach may explain why Remington Norman remarked in his book
``Rhone Renaissance'' (Wine Appreciation Guild, 1996) that in
outlook Graillot is ``more Bordelais than Rhone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He selects and blends to make his wine, the idea of `brand' or
`house wine' usurping that of terroir,'' Norman wrote. In other
words, he is more interested in making a wine that reflects his
taste than one that reflects the soil and weather that produced it.
</P>
<P>
   Being Bordelais in outlook does not, of course, mean that
Graillot makes Bordeaux-style wines. His are full-bodied Rhone
wines, with the depth, the power and the spice and raspberry
flavors that are characteristic of the syrah grape.
</P>
<P>
   Until the mid-1980s, just around the time that Graillot came
along, most of the Crozes-Hermitage growers sent their grapes to a
cooperative at Tain, where they were paid by weight. Now, the most
serious growers make their own wine, riskily leaving the grapes on
the vines longer and severely lowering crop levels to produce more
intense wines. At Domaine les Chenes Verts, the Guiraude is aged
entirely in wood, in barrels used once or twice by famous
Burgundian producers like Sauzet and Domaine Dujac. His other wines
are aged partially in wood and partially in stainless steel.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite among the Crozes-Hermitages served at Montrachet was
the 1989: it had both richness and elegance. Most of the younger
wines were not yet ready to drink. You can expect a Guiraude to be
in the $25-to-$30 range; the regular Alain Graillot
Crozes-Hermitage sells for about $18.
</P>
<P>
   (The big winner that night, for me, was La Chapelle Hermitage
1982. It was a wine to make one forget Burgundy for an entire
evening. That it was served with poached foie gras with truffles
didn't hurt.)
</P>
<P>
   Graillot wines are hardly supermarket items, but neither are
they as rare as some cult wines from the Cote Rotie, in the
northern Rhone _ or as some Napa Valley labels, for that matter.
Good shops will have them or can get them.

 &HT;    EXPERIENCED PROSECUTORS HEADLINE HOUSE TRIAL TEAM
 &HT;    850&AMP;add.

 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As a prosecutor, James Rogan has felt the courtroom
sting of having his case against a high-profile defendant summarily
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   As a deputy district attorney in Los Angeles a decade ago, Rogan
charged mortician David Sconce with using oleander poison to kill a
rival funeral director in the notorious Lamb Funeral Home case.
Although Sconce and other family members were imprisoned for
stealing and selling body organs and gold teeth from corpses,
forging organ donor cards, and conducting mass cremations at a
secret crematorium, the murder charge was thrown out for lack of
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Now Rogan is one of several seasoned former prosecutors who have
taken lead roles in presenting impeachment evidence against
President Clinton. Although all 13 of the House managers are
attorneys and members of the Judiciary Committee, some have little
trial experience and others have never prosecuted a criminal case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some haven't done a lick of lawyering in 30 years,'' the
National Law Journal noted.
</P>
<P>
   Experienced or not, the managers are all anxiously awaiting a
decision by the Senate on whether to dismiss the case or to grant
the managers' request to hear witnesses. Votes are expected by
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like a real trial,'' said Rogan, R-Calif. ``We have
to play the hand we're dealt.''
</P>
<P>
   If witnesses are permitted, the former prosecutors among the
managers are expected to do most of the questioning. In addition to
Rogan, they include three former U.S. attorneys _ Reps. Ed Bryant
of Tennessee, Bob Barr of Georgia and Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas.
Reps. Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Bill McCollum of Florida
have considerable experience as military prosecutors in the Judge
Advocate General (JAG) Corps.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson, whose down-home drawl has become familiar to TV talk
show viewers, has the most trial experience of all the House
managers. He has prosecuted or defended more than 100 jury cases.
As the U.S. attorney for western Arkansas, he directed the 1984
case in which Roger Clinton, brother of the then-Arkansas governor,
pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.
Roger Clinton was sentenced to serve two years in prison and later
testified against an Arkansas attorney involved in drug dealing
under the plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
   In other well-publicized cases, Hutchinson successfully
prosecuted five Arkansans who had hidden a tax protester before his
death in a shootout with federal marshal and sent a Republican
sheriff to jail for marijuana distribution.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Hutchinson recalled his days as an Arkansas defense
lawyer in urging the Senate to allow witnesses. He told of a case
where a witness against his client was not at all credible in
person but whose written deposition was powerfully persuasive when
read by a jury. ``The story needs to be told. The truth should be
determined. Justice should be accomplished,'' said Hutchinson.
``That is done not through lawyers up here talking, it's done not
through transcripts, but through witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, after teaching constitutional law at West Point as a JAG
officer, was named U.S. attorney for western Tennessee. There he
prosecuted the worst mass murder in the state's history. In an
isolated cabin, Dennis Harris lost $600 in a poker game and then
killed the six other players because he was afraid to tell his wife
about the loss. Harris shot one of his poker buddies in the head,
then tied up the others and burned them alive in the cabin. Bryant
prosecuted him on a federal arson charge, getting a sentence of
life plus 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant also directed the successful prosecution of then-Judge
David Lanier, who was convicted of sexual assaulting and harassing
women in his courtroom in a landmark decision later upheld by the
Supreme Court. However, Bryant resigned in protest after the
Justice Department sought to seat a new jury in his fraud case
against then-Rep. Harold E. Ford, D-Tenn. Ford was later acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   Barr, while earning his law degree from Georgetown University,
worked as a CIA analyst. Later, he was appointed U.S. attorney for
the northern district of Georgia and successfully prosecuted
then-Rep. Pat Swindall, R-Ga., for perjury. In a complicated case,
Swindall had backed out of financial deal with undercover agent who
had said he wanted to launder drug money. Summoned before a grand
jury, Swindall denied knowing the source of the funds and afterward
was indicted for perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's folksy courtroom manner has been widely acclaimed as
effective in the Senate case. As a JAG officer, Graham was the lead
prosecutor for U.S. Air Force in Europe from 1984 to 1988. His
cases included fraternization charges involving sexual relations
between military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell, as a JAG officer in the Naval reserves for 20 years,
served as prosecutor, defender and judge at various times. His last
prosecution was a drug case in Jacksonville about five years ago,
said an aide. Before his election to Congress in 1980, McCollum
handled insurance defense cases for a mid-sized law firm in
Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   TV viewers have seen less of the other House managers, most of
whom have limited courtroom experience.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Chris Cannon of Utah has never prosecuted a case, and has
served as lead courtroom attorney in only a couple of instances. As
an Interior Department attorney during the Reagan administration,
Cannon did negotiate settlements with mining companies, but the
Justice Department took over any cases that went to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin practiced only about six
months as private attorney before becoming a state assemblyman. His
last courtroom presentation came in a 1975 divorce case. However,
he did lead the House team in the impeachment trial of U.S.
District Judge Harry E. Claiborne. Or perhaps his colleagues
enlisted Sensenbrenner as a good luck charm: He won $250,000 in the
D.C. Lottery in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Another House manager with JAG experience is Stephen Buyer of
Indiana. Called to active duty in the Persian Gulf as a U.S. Army
Reserves captain in 1990, Buyer was a legal adviser during Desert
Storm. He served as a legal liaison to the International Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   A Cincinnati city councilman before his election to Congress,
Rep. Steve Chabot of Ohio handled mostly civil cases such as wills
and divorces rather than criminal defenses in his private law
practice. Before entering politics, Rep. Charles Canady of Florida
specialized in corporate litigation after graduating from Yale Law
School. Rep. George Gekas of Pennsylvania was a local prosecutor _
but more than 30 years ago, before his election to the state
legislature in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde of Illinois is
a practitioner of politics rather than courtroom law. Hyde has
served in Congress since 1974 and in the Illinois legislature for
eight years before that.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Rogan said he was not frustrated at the limitations
imposed upon the House managers by the Senate. Frustration was
being an overworked and under-staffed assistant district attorney
in Los Angeles, he recalled, and being called upon to prosecute a
rape case at a moment's notice and with no time for preparation.
</P>
<P>
   As a prosecutor, Rogan displayed a flair for drama. In a
vehicular homicide case _ where a drunk driver killed four people _
Rogan lined 10 glasses up on the jury box and slowly filled each
with beer to illustrate how much the defendant drank before hitting
his victims. Then he raised four fingers and snapped his fingers to
show how quickly four lives were lost.
</P>
<P>
   He won a conviction.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When the first reports of a food-poisoning outbreak from hot
dogs and deli meats started to accumulate in state health
departments across the United States last August, officials could
not have guessed that the effort to contain the eruption would be
so ineffective that they would still be counting victims five
months later.
</P>
<P>
   A recall of meats made by a Sara Lee Corp. subsidiary, Bil Mar
Foods in Zeeland, Mich., began on Dec. 22. But some state public
health officials say the outbreak could have been contained sooner
had the Agriculture Department done its job.
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, the Agriculture Department has announced recalls
of processed meats contaminated with listeria from four other
companies in the last four months, most recently last weekend. But
consumers may have a difficult time understanding why those recalls
were announced by the government and Bil Mar's was not.
</P>
<P>
   Listeria monocytogenes is not a serious threat to healthy
people, causing only short-term gastrointestinal problems. But it
is a big risk to people 75 and older, people with compromised
immune systems, pregnant women and the very young. Pregnant women
and their unborn children are in the greatest danger. The current
outbreak associated with Bil Mar has been blamed for 13 deaths and
two miscarriages or stillbirths; in all, there have been 70
confirmed cases.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike salmonella and E. coli 0157:H7, which have become
household words in the United States, listeria is not well known.
There are only 1,000 to 2,000 reported cases of listeriosis in the
United States each year; an accurate figure cannot be obtained, as
health professionals do not routinely test for it and many cases go
undetected.
</P>
<P>
   But health officials find it especially troubling because, based
on the number of reported cases, the percentage of people who die
from it is much higher than from most other food-borne bacteria.
And the incubation period is much longer, up to 70 days before
symptoms appear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listeria is rare,'' said Dr. Robert Tauxe, chief of the
food-borne and diarrheal diseases branch of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta, ``but in someone susceptible, it
is catastrophic.'' In addition to causing miscarriages and
stillbirths, listeria can cause fatal blood infections and
meningitis.
</P>
<P>
   Without a new method of detection, Tauxe said, ``I don't think
we would have identified where the listeria came from.''
</P>
<P>
   The new system, called Pulsenet, gives scientists the ability to
fingerprint the DNA of bacteria and then compare the fingerprints
to see if the listeria is from a common source. The system was set
up in 1997 to track E. coli 0157:H7, but it appears to be equally
successful with listeria.
</P>
<P>
   American scientists began to take listeria seriously in 1985,
when 18 deaths were traced to the eating of Jalisco brand soft
cheese. (The company is now defunct.) There were also 30
stillbirths and deaths of newborns. Another 142 people became ill.
</P>
<P>
   Listeria is carried in the intestines of animals and can easily
come in contact with dairy products, uncooked meats, fish, poultry
and vegetables as well as precooked meats like the ones responsible
for the August outbreak. The investigators say they do not know how
the listeria contaminated the cooked meats at Bil Mar Foods.
</P>
<P>
   Food-borne diseases like listeriosis are more troubling today
for several reasons, including changes in the makeup of the
population and the increasingly complex way food is processed and
distributed. The population is aging: In 1950, 2.6 percent of
Americans were over 74; by 1995, the percentage was 5.6. The number
of people who survive cancer for five years has also increased, as
has the number of people who have AIDS or are living with
transplanted organs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the centralization of food production has turned
what might previously have been a small local problem into a global
one. Products from the Bil Mar plant, for example, are distributed
all over the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Dr. Michael Osterholm, the state epidemiologist at the
Minnesota Health Department, says he is increasingly frustrated
with the federal government's response to outbreaks of food
poisoning, and even with the new detection system.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bil Mar Foods case, the Agriculture Department left the
announcement of the recall to the company. The agency does not
announce recalls until it has proof that a sealed product contains
the disease-causing bacteria, and it did not have that proof until
Dec. 31, nine days later.
</P>
<P>
   When the company announced the recall, a spokesman for the
Agriculture Department, Andrew Solomon, said, reporters who cover
the agency were notified and the information was put on the
agency's Web site and on its consumer-information line
(800-535-4555).
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt the word was out there and an additional press release
would not have generated new news coverage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Osterholm disagrees. ``If there had been a real effort to get
the message out by the Department of Agriculture throughout the
country, consumers would have had more awareness,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both he and Dale Morris, the director of the division of
infectious disease of the New York State Health Department, say
there can never be enough notification. In Broome County, in
upstate New York, they say, Meals on Wheels was still serving the
Bil Mar products to elderly clients eight days after the recall,
because it had not been notified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those people are one of the highest-risk populations in the
country,'' Osterholm said. And there may still be tainted hot dogs
or deli meats in people's freezers.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, the Agriculture Department did take action. Over
the weekend, it announced the recall of hot dogs from Thorn Apple
Valley in Forrest City, Ark., because of listeria.
</P>
<P>
   The previous week, the agency announced the recall of deli meat
from Oscar Mayer Foods for the same bacteria, as it did in October
for hot dogs made by Dixie Packers Inc. of Madison, Fla., and
cheeseburger sandwiches from Hormel Food Corp.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the last line of defense against food-borne illness is
consumers, who are advised to take the standard measures: thorough
cooking of raw animal products, thorough washing of all food that
is to be eaten raw like fruits and vegetables; keeping foods to be
eaten raw separate from uncooked meats; thorough washing of hands,
knives and cutting boards.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many other disease-causing bacteria, listeria can grow in
a refrigerator that has a normal temperature of 40 degrees, which
means leftovers should be reheated.
</P>
<P>
   But how does this advice fit in with meats that people expect to
eat without further cooking?
</P>
<P>
   Public health officials strongly urge those at greatest risk
from listeria to stay away from all soft cheeses, including feta
and blue-veined cheeses like Roquefort and Camembert. They also say
that it is essential to cook hot dogs until the internal
temperature reaches 165 degrees, by either steaming or frying.
Cooking in the microwave is not recommended. And unless people at
risk are willing to eat salami, corned beef and pastrami hot _ in
other words, cooked again _ they should not eat them at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listeria hasn't been on anyone's radar screen,'' Tauxe said.
``But it's something pregnant women should be made aware of. At
this point, as far as I can tell, the number of pregnant women who
are aware of this is zero.''

SUPERBOWL STEAKS WITH POTATO-GARLIC AND GRATIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (This is the last of eight columns by Alfred Portale, the executive
chef and an owner of Gotham Bar and Grill in Manhattan. His
collaborator on these columns was Dorie Greenspan. Next week: Rick
Moonen, the executive chef of Oceana in Manhattan.)  
 (HLW)  
 By ALFRED PORTALE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I take football seriously, and so do the people who
work with me, which is why I close the restaurant on Super Bowl
Sunday and invite my staff and their families to eat, drink and
cheer their favorites on big-screen televisions set up around the
dining room. I've always been a football fan (my hometown team is
the Buffalo Bills), I've always had friends in to watch the game
and I've always cooked something special _ but easy _ for halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Very often, that has been these pan-roasted steaks with garlicky
potato gratin.
</P>
<P>
   So that you don't miss a minute of Sunday's game, start cooking
the gratin before kickoff. It will be done before halftime, so when
there's a commercial, run into the kitchen and turn off the oven.
(The gratin can stay inside.) Take the steaks out of the
refrigerator then, to bring them up to room temperature so they
will cook perfectly. Then the minute the halftime whistle blows,
run back and start the steaks.
</P>
<P>
   I've chosen filets as much for their size as for their taste:
because they're small, three fit in a pan, leaving enough room for
each to get a ``steakhouse crust'' from a home stove's heat. After
I press cracked peppercorns into the steaks, I cook them in heavy
skillets for six minutes on a side, and they're just the way I like
them _ rare. To test for doneness, press the steaks. If the dent
you've made comes back slowly, they're rare; if it springs back
more quickly, they're medium, and if it doesn't give at all (like a
pigskin), they're well done.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need a sauce for the steaks because the gratin is so
creamy. I submerge thinly sliced potatoes in garlic-infused cream
and bake them until they absorb the cream and develop a golden
crust. You can dust the top with grated Gruyere if you like, or
next time, add mushrooms, butternut squash or even artichokes to
the potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Take it from one who knows: even if your team is behind at the
half, this combination is always a winner.
</P>
<P>
   PAN-ROASTED FILET MIGNON
</P>
<P>
   Time: 20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   6 teaspoons cracked white peppercorns
</P>
<P>
   6 8-ounce filets mignons, each about 1\ inches thick
</P>
<P>
   Coarse salt
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons canola oil
</P>
<P>
   1. Press peppercorns evenly into steaks, using 1 teaspoon for
each filet. Then season to taste with salt.
</P>
<P>
   2. Pour 1 tablespoon oil into each of two heavy-bottomed 10-inch
skillets, and place over high heat. When oil just begins to smoke,
place 3 steaks in each pan. Cook steaks 6 minutes on each side for
rare, 7 minutes for medium-rare and 9 minutes for medium. If
necessary, turn heat down to keep them from burning.
</P>
<P>
   3. Transfer steaks to a plate, cover with foil and let them rest
5 minutes. Serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 servings.

<P>
   POTATO-GARLIC GRATIN
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour 45 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Butter for greasing baking dish
</P>
<P>
   4 pounds Yukon Gold or russet potatoes
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground white pepper
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   2 small cloves garlic, peeled and minced
</P>
<P>
   2 cups (approximately) heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Butter a 9-by-11-inch baking
dish.
</P>
<P>
   2. Peel potatoes, placing them in a bowl of cold water. Using a
mandoline (which will keep the slices together so that they may be
fanned out later) or a sharp knife, cut potatoes lengthwise into
slices [ inch thick. Place potatoes in a single layer in the dish,
fanning each one out so that each slice slightly overlaps its
neighbor to cover the bottom of the dish. Sprinkle with salt and
pepper to taste, nutmeg, and some of the garlic. Make as many
layers as needed to use all potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   3. Pour cream over potatoes half a cup at a time, pressing down
firmly on potatoes after each addition to distribute cream evenly.
When all cream is added, it should just cover potatoes when they
are pressed; a little more or a little less than 2 cups may be
needed.
</P>
<P>
   4. Cover dish with foil. Poke a few holes in the foil, and bake
1 hour. Remove foil, and bake until potatoes have absorbed cream
and top of gratin is golden, about 20 minutes more. Serve hot.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 servings.

   It appears to be a simple gratin. It is a tall, square stack of
yams, browned on top and sagging on the edges. As you sink your
fork into it, though, it reveals layer upon fine layer, like a
piece of puff pastry. And when you bite into it, the layers,
separated by a smoky chipotle-scented cream, fall apart in your
mouth.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this gratin at Mesa Grill so exceptional? The precise
slicing of the yams.
</P>
<P>
   Consider another example, a familiar garnish on desserts around
the city: the wafer-thin, perfectly even cross section of apple,
dried to a sweet, brittle chip in the oven. It's so thin, it's
translucent. And if it weren't cut just so, it would simply be a
dopey, chewy slice of dried apple.
</P>
<P>
   Most chefs can dazzle home cooks with their knife skills, but
even they cannot perform such precision on yams and apples. Their
secret, the tool that no chef would live without, is the mandoline.
</P>
<P>
   With this slicing tool, they can cut carrots on an angle into
exactly one-sixteenth-inch slices. They can transform a zucchini
into julienne finer than matchsticks. They can reduce a firm,
starchy potato to sheets that fold like prosciutto.
</P>
<P>
   But even as home cooks rush to embrace every implement of the
professional kitchen, the mandoline remains one of the few to be
overlooked. That's at least partly because of their unwavering
devotion to another professional tool: the food processor.
</P>
<P>
   But the mandoline is in many ways more useful than a food
processor, which is cumbersome and offers little flexibility. With
the turn of a knob or the press of a lever, most mandoline blades
can be adjusted to the millimeter, so you can slice in the precise
thickness you want. You get consistency and, with practice, great
speed. A potato can be finely sliced in little more than a minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do everything on the mandoline,'' said Carol Peck, the
owner of the Good News Cafe in Woodbury, Conn. ``We use it a good
two or three hours a day.''
</P>
<P>
   At Cena in the Flatiron district, it is considered so crucial
that the cooks are required to provide their own mandolines along
with their knives.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, it is really just a straightforward device _ a sharp
blade fixed between braces and set up on an angle, like a
washboard. It has but a single function: it cuts.
</P>
<P>
   You adjust the thickness of slices _ as fine as a millimeter or
as thick as a quarter inch _ and simply slide vegetables or fruits
down the mandoline and across the blade.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear exactly when the mandoline was invented, but an
early version was used in the 19th century in Alsace, France, for
shredding cabbage for choucroute. It was bigger and bulkier than
the mandoline of today, with a single straight blade set into wood.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, Bron of Thonon-les-Bains, France, came out with a
heavy-duty nickel-coated version, and in 53 years, the design has
barely changed.
</P>
<P>
   The gold standard of mandolines, the Bron is still expensive
(about $144), still clunky and still a beautiful, sculptural piece
of cookware. But cheaper varieties are now breathing down its neck.
Many professional kitchens depend on the cheap (about $24), plastic
Benriner, which can simply be tossed out when the blade goes dull.
</P>
<P>
   The mandoline is not for the faint of heart, however.
Practically everyone who has a mandoline has a mandoline story. And
few are pretty. The mandoline can be very dangerous. The exposed
blade is extremely sharp, and there is little protection for your
hands as you push fruits and vegetables against it. There are hand
guards on many mandolines, but it is still a fairly barbaric
contraption.
</P>
<P>
   Some dishes, though, cannot be made without it. The ubiquitous
gaufrette potato chips, with their lattice cut, for instance,
cannot be sliced with a knife. Some mandolines come equipped with a
crenulated blade, so you can run the potato over the blade, turning
it 90 degrees with each slice to produce the lattice pattern.
</P>
<P>
   The potato-wrapped sea bass at Daniel is another. Improbably
thin, long strips of potato are what make the dish. They cling like
gauze around the fillet and, when sauteed, crisp up and protect the
delicate fish within.
</P>
<P>
   Or beet chips. Few mortals could take a knife to a raw beet and
come up with anything that remotely resembles equally sized,
one-sixteenth-inch thick round circles.
</P>
<P>
   The mandoline is even more convincing, though, when it is used
to transform conventional dishes. Jean-Georges Vongerichten, the
chef at Jean Georges, uses it to make a typical fennel and apple
salad.
</P>
<P>
   But by slicing the fennel and apple as thinly as possible on a
mandoline, rather than having the usual texture of coleslaw, the
fennel and apple are more like tissue paper _ gossamer sheets that
melt on the tongue. The flavors blend more subtly and the salad
looks like a glistening tangle of opaque ribbon.
</P>
<P>
   Potato Maximes, or potato chips fried in clarified butter, can
also take on greater dimensions when sliced with a mandoline. In
his book, ``Great American Food'' (Random House, 1996), Charlie
Palmer alters the recipe slightly by making paper-thin slices of
potato on a mandoline, then sandwiching herbs between two slices
and baking them. The potato chips turn out like flower petals
pressed in glass.
</P>
<P>
   But what chefs find most desirable about the mandoline is its
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much quicker and much more accurate because you set the
spacing, so every cut will be the same,'' said Michael Romano, the
chef at Union Square Cafe. ``I couldn't imagine a professional
kitchen without one.''

<P>
   1 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon chipotle pepper puree
</P>
<P>
   1{ pounds yams, peeled and cut into 1/16-inch thick slices on a
mandoline
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper.
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. In a bowl, whisk together the

   HERB POTATO MAXIMES
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from ``Great American Food'' (Random House, 1996) by
Charlie Palmer and Judith Choate &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: about 1 hour
</P>
<P>
   { cup unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   2 large Idaho potatoes
</P>
<P>
   20 1{-inch-long chive points
</P>
<P>
   20 fresh tarragon leaves
</P>
<P>
   20 small chervil sprigs
</P>
<P>
   Coarse salt.
</P>
<P>
   1. Place butter in a small saucepan over very low heat. Cook for
15 minutes. While it cooks, use a ladle to skim off the white
frothy matter, until the top of the melted fat is clear. Remove
from heat, and let stand for 10 minutes. Pour yellow fat into a
bowl, taking care not to let any of the solids at the bottom of the
pan get into the bowl.
</P>
<P>
   2. Heat the oven to 300 degrees. Brush a heavy nonstick baking
sheet with the clarified butter. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   3. Peel potatoes. Rinse them under cold running water, and pat
dry. Using a mandoline, slice one potato, lengthwise, into
paper-thin slices, discarding the end pieces. You should get 18 to
20 even slices from each potato.
</P>
<P>
   4. Working quickly, lay the potato slices out next to one
another, but not touching, on the prepared baking sheet. Place one
piece each of the chive, tarragon and chervil in a pattern in the
center of each potato slice, leaving a small border.
</P>
<P>
   5. Slice the second potato as described in Step 3. Dry the
slices slightly, and lay them evenly on top of the herb-topped
slices. Once all the potatoes are covered, firmly press each
``sandwich'' together to seal the edges. Brush with the remaining
butter, and season with salt to taste.
</P>
<P>
   6. Place in the oven, and bake, turning the baking sheet from
time to time, for 25 minutes, or until golden. Remove from oven,
and drain on paper towels. Serve at room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: about 20 chips.

   SKATE WING WITH CRISP PARSNIP CRUST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from Geoffrey Zakarian, chef at Patroon &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   1 large parsnip, peeled and trimmed
</P>
<P>
   4 skate wing fillets (about 6 ounces each), skinned and boned
</P>
<P>
   1 egg, lightly beaten
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon canola oil
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   Juice of { lemon, for sprinkling
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley.
</P>
<P>
   1. Cut parsnips into 4-inch lengths. On a mandoline, slice the
parsnips lengthwise into 1/16-inch slices. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   2. Lightly brush the skate wings with the egg wash. Lay parsnip
slices on the skate in neat rows, touching one another. Season with
salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   3. In a 12-inch nonstick saute pan, heat the oil over medium
high heat. Using a spatula, carefully flip the skate wing into the
pan in a single motion, parsnip side down. Let the fish cook
undisturbed for 4 to 5 minutes. Carefully turn over, and cook about
2 minutes more, or until fish is lightly firm to the touch.
</P>
<P>
   4. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium
heat. Cook until it smells nutty and browns lightly. Add the lemon
juice.
</P>
<P>
   5. To serve, arrange the fish on a platter, the parsnip side up.
Spoon the butter over the top. Sprinkle with parsley. Serve
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

</P>
<P>
   If used incorrectly, the mandoline, with its exposed blade, can
be an extremely dangerous tool. But with a little caution and
common sense, you can avoid losing fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, your mandoline will have a hand guard between your
fingers and the blade. On the Matfer mandoline, for instance, the
hand guard has stipples on the underside to grasp the food and a
handle on top to make it easy to slide the food over the blade,
keeping your fingers inches above.
</P>
<P>
   If the vegetables or fruits you are slicing are large, cut them
into sizes that can fit under the hand guard.
</P>
<P>
   Position the mandoline on a solid surface, and set the blade to
the desired thickness. Place the food under the hand guard. To
slice, begin at the top of the mandoline and slide down and over
the blade in a single fluid motion. Do not press too hard or the
food can slip. The more fluid your motions and the more evenly you
apply pressure, the safer the mandoline will be. Start slowly,
until you feel comfortable slicing.
</P>
<P>
   If the food you are slicing will not fit under the hand guard,
or if you choose not to use the guard, the best alternative is to
wrap the fruit or vegetable in a small kitchen towel and use it as
a protective layer between your fingers and the blade.
</P>
<P>
   As you get toward the end of slicing a potato or apple, do not
grab the towel with your fingers pointed downward. Instead, lay
your palm flat on top of it with your fingers extended so they stay
out of the blade's way.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important is that your mandoline's blade should be
sharp, so that there is less resistance when slicing. You are more
likely to slip if pushing too hard against a dull blade. If they
become dull, some blades may be replaced, others removed and
sharpened. The manufacturer's instructions will tell you which to
do.
</P>
<P>
   Four Variations on the Mandoline
</P>
<P>
   Whether you are paying $24 or $159, every mandoline requires a
little compromise. I tested the four brands most commonly found in
cookware stores: V-Slicer Plus, Benriner, Bron and Matfer.
</P>
<P>
   The most intimidating and possibly least effective is the
V-Slicer. The blade, shaped in a ``V,'' cuts through most
vegetables with little effort. But each slice requires sliding your
hand between the blades _ and if you're making a julienne cut, over
8 or 24 little blades set in the center of the ``V'' that stick up
like shark fins. It is simply frightening to use.
</P>
<P>
   It also offers little flexibility: it only cuts foods thick (a
quarter inch) or thin (one-sixteenth of an inch). There are wide
and narrow julienne attachments but no crenulated blade _ so no
gaufrettes. It is $39.95 at Broadway Panhandler, 477 Broome Street
(Wooster Street); (212) 966-3434.
</P>
<P>
   The Benriner, made in Japan, is the darling of chefs, who
consider it disposable when the blades dull. It's kitschy in
design, constructed of plastic imprinted with wood grain. It does
have a serious, razor-sharp blade, positioned at an angle in the
center of the mandoline, but that does not mean it is paired with a
decent hand guard. This one is so small and difficult to hold that
it is practically useless. Be careful.
</P>
<P>
   The instruction booklet, which reads as if it were written by a
first-year English student, is not much help. Thankfully, it is an
easy mechanism to figure out. The thickness of slices can be finely
adjusted from an eighth of an inch to a barely detectable width by
turning a knob, and the three julienne blades can be installed and
secured with large screws.
</P>
<P>
   As with the V-Slicer, though, there is no crenulated blade. For
$23.98 at Zabar's, 2245 Broadway (80th Street); (212) 787-2000,
it's worth considering.
</P>
<P>
   If you must have gaufrettes, then you will have to lay down the
cash. The Bron mandoline has a crenulated blade built into the base
frame. You simply raise the blade to put it into action. In fact,
the most appealing part of this classic mandoline is that all the
blades are built in.
</P>
<P>
   The only loose part is the hand guard, which slides on and off;
it was the most stable and protective of all the hand guards I
tried. Its flat blade is not quite as sharp as the one on the
Benriner, but it can be sharpened. Its blades can be finely
adjusted, to a maximum of three-eighths of an inch.
</P>
<P>
   And a heavy, sturdy frame and top-quality construction make it
worth the $143.95 it costs at A Cook's Companion, 152 Atlantic
Avenue (Clinton Street) in Brooklyn; (718) 852-6641.
</P>
<P>
   The Matfer mandoline also turns out a nice gaufrette cut and
with zucchini, potato and celery root, perfect julienne, gratings
and paper thin slices. It can produce slices as thick as
three-sixteenths of an inch. Though the julienne blades are not
built in, as with the Bron, they are easy to slip in and out. This
mandoline can be ordered for $159 from Williams-Sonoma, (800)
541-2233.

DIVISIONS AMONG ISRAELI JEWS ARE DOCUMENTED IN FILM 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEL AVIV, Israel _ Every day, Elinor Nagar, a spunky teen-ager
with long ringlets and a sweet giggle, is bused ``uptown'' from a
run-down, working-class suburb to a high school in affluent North
Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   The divide between North and South Tel Aviv is a geographic and
cultural one, and given the city's intense traffic, it takes Miss
Nagar two hours to cross it every day. Level-headed and ambitious,
she seems bound to become one of the few success stories in a
25-year-old ``integration'' program that seeks to give poor
Sephardic teen-agers from ``the south'' a shot at social mobility
through education in quality high schools.
</P>
<P>
   Most of her childhood friends dropped out long ago, undone by
the stress of competing with classmates whose houses their mothers
cleaned. But Miss Nagar, the daughter of Yemenite and Egyptian
immigrants, is determined to escape her parents' fate as what her
father calls ``the blacks'' of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   One day at her North Tel Aviv school, Miss Nagar got a startling
lesson. Her home-room teacher, a yuppie in khaki shorts and a polo
shirt, stood before her class, fully aware that a filmmaker's
cameras were trained on him. He then blamed the Sephardic community
for dragging itself down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids from South Tel Aviv don't have the same motivation to
succeed, or the capacity,'' he said. ``It comes from the home. It's
a question of upbringing.''
</P>
<P>
   For Senyora Bar-David, the filmmaker, who is also from the South
Tel Aviv-Jaffa area, the moment was an ``ace in the hole.'' Almost
20 years after she graduated from the integration program, she
sought to explore the North-South divide through a personal
documentary, ``The South: Alice Never Lived Here,'' which is
showing at the Jewish Film Festival in New York's Lincoln Center at
6:15 p.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher, Ms. Bar-David felt, epitomized the denial by the
Ashkenazi elite that Israeli society is capable of discrimination.
Too little had changed since she was a child, she thought, and her
melancholy permeates the film, a rough-hewn but lyrical portrait of
three generations of Sephardic women: Ms. Bar-David, who is 35, her
grandmother and Miss Nagar, 17, whom she sees as her mirror image
in this generation.
</P>
<P>
   The rift between the Ashkenazi elite _ Jews of Central and
Eastern European descent _ and the immigrants from North Africa and
Arab countries is a fact of Israeli life. But things actually have
changed. It is emblematic that the former defense minister, Yitzhak
Mordechai, an Iraqi-born Kurdish Jew, is the first Sephardic
candidate for prime minister, and that Shas, an Orthodox Sephardic
political movement, has grown into the third-largest party in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Sephardic Jews constitute nearly half the population, and it is
impossible to keep so many people marginalized. What used to be
considered a taboo, intermarriage _ as it was called _ between
Ashkenazim and Sephardim, has lost its shock value. Pop music from
North Africa, which used to be sold only at cassette stands at bus
stations, dominates the radio airwaves. A quarter of the university
students are Sephardic. And the army has become a path of social
mobility; Kurdish-born Shaul Mofaz is the new chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   But the divide lingers, and many Sephardic families still feel
like outsiders, either in the barren development towns where the
government resettled them decades ago, or in the housing projects
of South Tel Aviv and Jaffa, where there are only vocational high
schools _ and the busing program, with its checkered history.
</P>
<P>
   Under a brilliant winter sun, Ms. Bar-David and Miss Nagar sat
on Sunday in a concrete courtyard of Tel Kabbir, the fortresslike
housing project in Jaffa where they both grew up. Like the
tenements of South Florida or Los Angeles, those in Israel do not
look too bad from the outside, especially with the old men playing
dominoes outside. But inside, the cement block, pocked plaster,
graffiti and litter are almost as depressing as in any inner city.
</P>
<P>
   South of Tel Aviv, just off the highway, Tel Kabbir, built in
the 1950s and home to about 15,000 people, feels like a forgotten
enclave, decorated with laundry lines. Ms. Bar-David and Miss
Nagar, model integration students in different eras, have always
felt torn between these stultifying projects, which were
nonetheless home, and the more exciting North Tel Aviv, which they
felt looked down its nose at them.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs is a world rarely explored in Israeli film. During the
editing, Ms. Bar-David said she asked herself several times ``if I
shouldn't just see a therapist,'' but continued out of a personal
commitment to explore an untouched subject.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``It was easier when we made films about the Palestinians,''
said Ms. Bar-David, who collaborates with her Moroccan-born
husband, David Benchetrit. ``That's an acknowledged problem here.
But the way that Sephardis feel exiled within Israel _ that's like
too uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Miss Nagar is almost a woman, but in the film she is a
precocious 15-year-old, swinging on a jungle gym in a desolate
playground and uttering very self-aware thoughts, at once
quintessentially adolescent and world-weary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I feel as if I exist in a distant place, cut off
from the world,'' she says in the film. ``I have a lot of anger for
people who look down on our neighborhood. And I am only 15. What do
the older people think? What hate have they developed in their
lives, and how do they live knowing such pain? It destroys you from
within. It destroys me from within.''
</P>
<P>
   When she realizes her mother cleans the house of a fellow
student, she trembles with fear that he will reveal her secret to
the others. Both proud and ashamed of her parents, she is scared
that Tel Kabbir will stamp her for life, closing doors and options.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are born to a place,'' she said. ``You learn to love it.
But you live the stereotype forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Her father, a laborer, upbraids her in the film for her
yearnings to escape. ``No matter where you go, you'll always be
black,'' he tells her. ``Tel Kabbir is where your roots are. And
the fact that I have raised a daughter here to believe she can
compete with the Ashkenazim only proves my point _ you don't really
need to leave to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the film was shot, Miss Nagar has survived two more years
of high school in North Tel Aviv. She is less angry, and more
hopeful. The film itself created a miniature revolution within the
school's society. The students were bused _ everyone, from both
North and South Tel Aviv _ to a theater to see it, and it was like
group therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ever thought we would make it in school,'' Miss Nagar
said. ``But we have, some of us. And because of the film, they
understand us better. Now there is a kind of unity between North
and South.''
</P>
<P>
   At these words, Ms. Bar-David's eyes opened wide. ``Elinor, I
didn't know that,'' she said. And flying off to the film festival
in New York, she said she felt lighter than she had in years.

A NEW GAUNTLET: COGNAC, MADE IN AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors` recipes at end of article)

 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UKIAH, Calif. _ When I first visited the Napa Valley, in 1965,
it was still the bucolic place pictured in Frank Loesser's musical
``The Most Happy Fella.'' There was no wine train. There were no
restaurants with gastronomic pretensions, and no fancy-pants
grocery stores or shops. Only a half-dozen vineyards caught your
eye as you drove up sleepy Route 29.
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, it's fairly popping with vineyards. On weekends,
it turns into a playpen for yuppies. But there is one intriguing
wine-related activity still in its infancy, little noticed by the
thundering herds: distilling.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly five tenacious enterprises in California are engaged in
the exacting business of producing brandies or eaux de vie by
traditional Continental methods _ two in the Napa Valley; two here
in Mendocino County, two hours north of San Francisco, and one in a
warehouse in Alameda, across the bay from San Francisco. They have
a formidable competitor in Portland, Ore. _ Steve McCarthy of Clear
Creek Distillery, whose eau de vie made from Bartlett pears is
quite spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   All the Californians turn out products that can stand comparison
with their counterparts in Europe, where the custom of drinking a
digestif _ a small glass of dry spirits after dinner, perhaps with
a coffee and a cigar _ is far better established than in America.
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose Bierce, an American, once called brandy ``a cordial
composed of one part thunder-and-lightning, one part remorse, two
parts bloody murder ... and four parts Holy Moses.'' He obviously
never tasted these.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, all the producers struggle to sell their wares, and none of
them turn up very often in your corner liquor store. Some of the
best California digestifs, like Germain-Robin and St. George, can
be found in fine wine shops and at deluxe restaurants around the
country, but others, like Jepson, are harder to come by.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best batches of each year's output at Alambic, made
in the hills above Ukiah by Hubert Germain-Robin, whose family made
cognac in the Charente region of southwestern France for 175 years,
is reserved for the White House. It is mellow and satisfying, with
an aroma compounded of fruit, spice and vanilla-tinged wood. Its
taste lingers long after the liquid is gone _ what the professional
tasters call a ``long finish.'' Classic stuff.
</P>
<P>
   At St. George Spirits in Alameda, Joerg Rupf, Alsatian-born,
makes the same kinds of clear, dry, fruit-based digestifs that are
produced in his homeland (and in Austria, Germany and Switzerland).
In recent years, he has submitted many of these ``white alcohols''
to an annual competition sponsored by Destillata, an Austrian
magazine, including poire; kirsch, made from cherries, and grappa,
distilled from the grape pomace left over from winemaking.
</P>
<P>
   Competing against Europe's best, they have all won gold medals,
and in 1997, Rupf and Lance Winters, his fellow distiller at St.
George, won the trophy for best in show.
</P>
<P>
   To get to Ansley J. Coale Jr.'s 2,000-acre sheep ranch, 1,100
feet above sea level, you have to negotiate a potholed one-lane
road that would challenge a panzer. When I visited him in November,
the trees were encrusted with moss and lichen engendered by 90
inches of rain in five months. Unadorned frame buildings popped in
and out of the fog, visible one minute, hidden the next.
``Brigadoon,'' my stepson said.
</P>
<P>
   Coale, 56, once taught at Berkeley. He met Germain-Robin, 48,
when he picked him up as a hitchhiker almost 20 years ago. Until
they sold out to the giant Martell, Germain-Robin's family had been
cognac distillers since 1782; 200 years later, he and Coale picked
up that thread in the New World.
</P>
<P>
   They built their distillery themselves _ a one-room shed the
size of an icehouse; a small pot still from the old country, fired
by propane, with shiny brass valves and the traditional swan's-neck
tube leading to a condenser; a Wisconsin dairy tank. They added an
aging cellar in 1983. The whole operation cost $85,000.
</P>
<P>
   As in cognac, Germain-Robin brandy is distilled twice. Each pass
takes 11 to 12 hours, and Germain-Robin does two a day, for six
months a year. What comes out is near-brandy, not yet drinkable.
The distilled liquid is pumped into 92-gallon French oak barrels,
allowed to rest for a year, then blended with brandies from other
vintages and brandies made from other types of grapes, then aged
further.
</P>
<P>
   The process is exactly the same as that used for cognac, but
only brandy made in designated zones in Charente can be called
that.
</P>
<P>
   What is different here is the wine from which the brandy is
made. In southwestern France, the traditional grapes are folle
blanche and colombard, supplemented starting early in this century
with ugni blanc, a varietal more appreciated for quantity than
quality. In France, many of the old-timers still tell you, ``The
thinner the wine, the richer the cognac.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost by accident, Coale and Germain-Robin found otherwise. In
the early days, they experimented, buying what came to hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more sun than Cognac does, so we get better, riper
grapes,'' Coale insisted. ``The right sugar content. Plenty of
acidity. That's what makes the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Germain-Robin added: ``They don't have a choice. I do.'' He buys
grapes and wine from Roederer Estate and Clos du Val, among others,
mostly in Mendocino County. I tasted one-year-old unblended
brandies from seven varietals, including muscat, which had exactly
the flowery aroma of Muscat de Baumes de Venise, a sweet wine from
the Rhone Valley; viognier, which had a touch of muskmelon in the
flavor; pinot noir, underdeveloped but robust, and zinfandel,
pleasantly peppery on the nose as well as the palate.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Oak, blending skill and time in the maturing shed will do
wonders for all of them. Some brandies will stay for a long time,
up to 50 years, perhaps. At the moment, Germain-Robin is producing
7,000 cases a year and selling 4,000; for a while, the firm sold
only 2,000 from an annual production of 5,000. Good for the
blending stock; bad for the balance sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Germain-Robin's standard product, labeled Fine, retails for $32;
it has overtones of clove and contains brandies up to five years
old. Its creamy XO, 13{ years old, costs $100. And if that doesn't
satisfy you, next month Coale plans to begin shipping Anno Domini
2000, a miraculously dense and complex brandy designed for
millionaires' millennium celebrations. It is made mostly from pinot
noir, harvested and distilled in 1983 and 1984, with a bit of
palomino, the grape of sherry, thrown in. Price: $350. Quality,
when I tasted it, a month after bottling: superior to Paradis and
other deluxe French blends, and equal to the best very old
single-vintage, small-producer cognacs.
</P>
<P>
   Jepson, the other Mendocino producer, is not nearly as
ambitious, but to say that is not at all to dismiss its brandies, a
7-to-8-year-old blend labeled ``rare'' ($34) and a
13-to-14-year-old Signature Reserve ($100). Both are made from
colombard grapes grown on the Jepson Estate, along the Russian
River near Hop-land, which also produces worthy white table wines.
</P>
<P>
   I found the lower-priced brandy round and notably spicy in
flavor, with hints of nutmeg, cinnamon and hazelnuts, if somewhat
too sharply alcoholic in attack. The Signature was not made
available for tasting.
</P>
<P>
   Miles Karakasevic is a fierce, combative, handsome Serb,
complete with mustache, who lives on a Napa mountaintop. There he,
too, follows family tradition, producing distillates of all sorts:
Grappa di Marko, named for his son, made from pomace still moist
with merlot rather than dry, as is usual; Calvad'or, a
calvados-like eau de vie, bursting with flavor, made from
Gravenstein apples, and Pachanga, an eau de vie made from Jerusalem
artichokes, with a resemblance to cactus-based mescal. It does
wonders for a Bloody Mary.
</P>
<P>
   There are other things, too: ``No fruit is safe from Miles,''
says his good-humored wife, Susan.
</P>
<P>
   Karakasevic (the name is pronounced kah-rah-KAH-shah-vitch) has
developed a method of flavoring vodka with California's
distinctively delicious Meyer lemons. He makes a wicked pastis. He
even makes port. All are sold under the name Domaine Charbay,
chiefly at the distillery, on Spring Mountain Road above St.
Helena, and served at local restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   My wife, Betsey; my stepson, John Brown, and I tried them all
one sunny morning just after Thanksgiving, and liked every one.
Well, tried almost all. We didn't get to taste Karakasevic's
long-promised brandy, distilled in 1983, he says, from folle
blanche grapes. He keeps postponing its release.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's shooting for ``the turn of the century.'' But his
wife, who has heard it all before, said, ``I'm not sure he'll come
through.''
</P>
<P>
   RMS is the opposite of Domaine Charbay, a big corporate
operation with a flossy, banner-bedecked visitor center down in the
Carneros section of the Napa Valley, a distillery with no fewer
than eight highly automated alambic stills and a barrel house that
holds a consequential asset: 4,000 casks of brandy, from the
vintages of 1982 through 1998, slowly mellowing. A black fungus
grows on the roof tiles of the barrel house, a curious sign of
authenticity; the brandy evaporating through the pores of the wood
_ ``the angel's share,'' the distillers call it _ feeds the fungus.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, RMS stood for Remy-Martin-Schramsberg, a joint
venture of the French cognac house and the California champagne
house. Schramsberg dropped out 12 years ago, and the initials are
now said to stand for ``rare-mature-special.'' David Key, who
showed us around, stated the obvious: ``This place was made to
distill a lot more than it does.'' The alambics are fired up only
eight weeks a year.
</P>
<P>
   RMS, like Germain-Robin, blends a range of brandies: SR, a
minimum of seven years old, $30 retail; QE, 14 years minimum, $116
in a lovely flagon; and Folle Blanche, ``a nod to history,'' a
brandy made only from folle blanche grapes from old vines at the
Louis M. Martini vineyards, 10 years old, $65. I particularly liked
the austere, delicate taste of the folle blanche (though I must
note in all honesty that most people disagree, preferring the SR
and QE).
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, RMS released no new product, even though
it was distilling the equivalent of up to 10,000 cases a year.
Almost all the sales took place at the visitor center; the rest
went into inventory. This year, the French owners are finally
making their first national sales push. It's a high-quality
product, and RMS finally has people out singing its praises.
</P>
<P>
   At their best, eaux de vie offer miraculously concentrated
flavors. Nothing tastes quite so much like fresh raspberries _ not
even fresh raspberries _ as a glass of well-chilled framboise. The
trick is to avoid the chemical or medicinal flavor that often
creeps into the distillation. And that Rupf of St. George certainly
does. Nor do his products have any of the coarse bite of alcohol
that mars down-market European brands.
</P>
<P>
   His methods are proven ones _ fruit is crushed at the peak of
ripeness, fermented without added sugar, distilled in pot stills
made by Arnold Holstein at Markdorf on the Bodensee in Bavaria,
probably the best in the world; the ``heads'' and ``tails,'' the
beginning and end of the two-hour distilling run, are cut
drastically, to eliminate the harsher flavors concentrated therein.
</P>
<P>
   I recently tasted St. George poire and framboise against poire
and framboise produced by Miclo and Massenez, two of the best
houses in Alsace, and by Brana, in the Pyrenees. I put St. George's
poire first, with Brana's just behind; Miclo's framboise came
first, with St. George's just behind. The differences were
minuscule.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When it came to kirsch, I much preferred St. George's spirit,
which is made from Montmorency cherries from Michigan and
Washington, the kind traditionally baked in pies, rather than from
Alsatian black cherries.
</P>
<P>
   Better than half of St. George's total output, about 5,000 cases
a year, goes to clients in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Like
Coale, Rupf says that it is the consistently high quality of the
fruit available in the United States _ it takes up to 30 pounds for
a single bottle _ that gives him a competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
   Under his own label, Rupf also makes several agreeably
smoky-tasting grappas, and he does contract distilling, too,
turning out a grappa for Eisele Vineyard in the Napa Valley, for
example, and a chardonnay brandy for Acacia. And Winters is
tinkering obsessively with a single-malt whiskey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joerg is legendary for his lack of marketing zeal,'' Winters
said, pointing to the dark recesses of the warehouse. ``There are
tanks of things back there that will never see the light of day
because he doesn't think they're good enough. He's not focused on
the bottom line.''

<P>
   \ cup blanched slivered almonds
</P>
<P>
   12 ounces semisweet chocolate
</P>
<P>
   14 tablespoons (1} sticks) unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   Butter and flour for pan
</P>
<P>
   8 large eggs, separated

TV NOTES: AN OFFICE DRONE BECOMES A STAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The hits just keep coming this winter in television's midseason:
this week even lowly UPN got into the act.
</P>
<P>
   Proving that the network might have life after all, ``Dilbert,''
UPN's new animated version of the popular comic strip, scored the
best number of the season for that struggling would-be network.
Overnight ratings from the nation's 44 biggest cities show that
``Dilbert'' posted a 7.3 rating, which more than tripled what UPN
had been doing on Monday nights at 8.
</P>
<P>
   The rating was good enough to beat the overnight number for
well-established shows on two networks, ``Melrose Place'' on Fox,
which scored a 6.2, and ``Suddenly Susan'' on NBC, which had a 7
rating. (Each rating point in the overnight measurement represents
623,882 homes.)
</P>
<P>
   And though it was not good enough to beat the rating for
``Seventh Heaven,'' the growing hit on UPN's big rival WB, UPN can
still claim bragging rights of a sort because the premiere of
``Dilbert'' beat the overnight rating for the September premiere of
WB's highly promoted new drama, ``Felicity.'' After receiving more
attention than any other new series on any network last fall
``Felicity'' opened with a 6.5 rating in the overnight measurement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dilbert'' certainly got every ounce of promotion that UPN
could muster, but it was not helped by all the magazine covers and
other free publicity surrounding ``Felicity.''
</P>
<P>
   UPN was also happy to point out that ``Dilbert'' more than
doubled the rating of the premiere of WB's big midseason comedy
hope, ``Zoe, Duncan, Jack and Jane,'' which scored an 3.2 rating.
</P>
<P>
   Fortune of `Providence'
</P>
<P>
   Despite getting ratings that dwarfed any comedy previously on
UPN, ``Dilbert'' will not be considered the salvation of the
network until it proves it can bring the viewer back next week and
every week thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   But the record of the shows that have been introduced this
winter after heavy promotion is exceptionally good. On Fox, ``The
PJ's,'' which turned up during every timeout on two football games
and then scored the best ratings of any new comedy on Fox, has held
up well, more than doubling Fox's performance at 8:30 on Tuesday
nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``60 Minutes II'' won a similar barrage of promotion on CBS and
opened with hitlike numbers on Wednesday at 9 p.m. The ratings
diminished only slightly in the second week and the show made an
impressive jump in the rating over the weak comedies that preceded
it at 8 and 8:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest story of the midseason continues to be NBC's
``Providence,'' which has now had three weeks to demonstrate how
strong it is: all three weeks it has dominated its Friday 8 p.m.
time slot.
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps the most eye-catching comparison, ``Providence'' is
the only new drama to win its time period in total viewers and
young adult viewers its first three weeks since ``E.R.'' went on
NBC five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The next new potential midseason hit on the horizon is Fox's
``Family Guy,'' yet another animated comedy. It will get perhaps
the best promotion of all on Sunday night when the show's pilot
follows what is sure to be the highest- rated show this year: the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The staying power of ``Family Guy'' will remain a mystery for
some time, however, because new episodes will not appear until
March.
</P>
<P>
   Golden Globes Golden
</P>
<P>
   Last year when ``Titanic'' was a phenomenon the movie industry
had not seen for decades, if ever, NBC rode the interest in the
film to the best showing ever by the Golden Globe Awards ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   No movie this year had anything like the following of
``Titanic'' and so the even better performance of the Golden Globes
ceremony on Sunday night has NBC executives more convinced than
ever that the show has become second only to the Academy Awards _
and possibly the Grammy Awards _ as an awards show attraction on
television.
</P>
<P>
   The telecast of the ``Golden Globes'' set another record for
NBC, climbing from a 15.9 rating last year to a 16.1 this year.
(Each national rating point represents 994,000 homes.) That left
every other award show this season in the dust including the Emmy
Awards and ``The People's Choice Awards.''
</P>
<P>
   It may also be hard for the Grammy Awards presentation next
month to beat that figure, though last year that show had a 17
rating. But that was up considerably from recent Grammy ratings.
</P>
<P>
   What is more remarkable is the growth in interest in the Golden
Globes in the four years the show has been on NBC. Each year, more
people have watched the presentation, resulting in more stars
turning up for the event, which, of course, has increased the
ratings further.
</P>
<P>
   Five year ago the Golden Globes presentation was still a
small-time awards with a small-time audience on cable television.
The last year the show was televised on the TBS cable channel it
scored only a 2.5 rating. That means almost eight times as many
people watched the show this year.

KANSAS CITY HAS A LOT RIDING ON TRUMP BID FOR FLAMINGO HILTON
CASINO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Name a building in New York City. There's a
fair chance Donald Trump owns it.
</P>
<P>
   Name a casino in Atlantic City. Ditto.
</P>
<P>
   Now The Donald's real estate empire is poised to expand again,
and for the first time into Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Gaming Commission meets Wednesday in Kansas City,
and the agenda includes the first public discussion of Trump's
surprise bid earlier this month to buy the troubled Flamingo Hilton
Casino in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers expect the flamboyant New York real estate
tycoon's $15 million, bargain-basement offer for the casino and his
application for a state gaming license to be approved later this
year with little dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly traded Trump Hotel &AMP; Casino Resorts Inc. already is
licensed by gaming authorities in New Jersey and Indiana, where the
companies have experienced few regulatory problems.
</P>
<P>
   Trump is regarded as a good corporate citizen in Gary, Ind., his
other riverboat market, and universally as a tough, even brutal,
competitor who sometimes wins the admiration of his adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   Trump executives are reluctant at this point to say how they
intend to upgrade and change the Kansas City operation, or whether
a trademark Trump hotel might be in the offing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know much about the Kansas City market yet,'' said
Joseph A. D'Amato, chief operating officer of Trump's riverboat and
300-room hotel in Gary. D'Amato is expected to play a supporting
role in establishing the Trump label in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   But the company makes it clear that Trump-flavored changes will
come.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone conference last week with gambling industry stock
analysts, Trump chief executive Nicholas Ribis hinted that the
Kansas City deal was the first of several casino acquisitions the
company hoped to announce this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This property has been beleaguered for some time,'' Ribis said
in reference to troubles that have threatened the Hilton Hotels
Corp. gambling license since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton _ the hospitality and gambling industry giant based in
Beverly Hills, Calif. _ has been troubled by the long-running
Kansas City Port Authority bribery scandal and the indictment last
month of former Hilton executive Markland Rousseau.
</P>
<P>
   The final chapter in that regulatory saga opens Wednesday when
Missouri Gaming Commission members could decide whether to sanction
Hilton or let the company walk away from its Missouri troubles.
</P>
<P>
   If the sale is approved, it will be Trump's second purchase of a
troubled Hilton casino. In the mid-1980s, Trump bought what now is
Trump Marina in Atlantic City when Hilton ran into licensing
problems in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   For Hilton, Ribis said, the Kansas City casino ``is a very small
asset to a very large company. But for us it's a major move to a
new jurisdiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Ribis also told analysts last week that the casino's general
manager would be Bruce McKee, a former Trump gaming executive who
left the company last year but is back and moving to Kansas City
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Trump officials also said they intended to offer employment to
most of Hilton's 800 current workers.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan McKenzie, the Flamingo Hilton's current general manager,
will move to Gulfport, Miss., where he is to head the recently
acquired Grand Casino under Hilton's spinoff Park Place
Entertainment Inc.
</P>
<P>
   While there are no firm development plans for Kansas City yet,
Trump spokesman Kenneth M. Ciancimino said the Trump name on the
door should be welcome news to gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Trump is adamant about providing the leading technology
and the best product in the marketplace,'' he said. ``Kansas City
will benefit from that.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump would assume ownership of a Kansas City casino that offers
players some of the area's highest slot machine payback
percentages, plus the area's most generous ``slot club,'' which
accumulates frequent-flier-type points for cash rebates and other
gifts.
</P>
<P>
   But the Trump organization also knows how to compete for
players.
</P>
<P>
   According to Casino Player magazine, Trump's riverboat in Gary
often is in contention for that Greater Chicago market's monthly
``loosest slots'' title, while Trump's Atlantic City casinos rank
in the middle of the pack among that city's 12 fiercely competitive
casino hotels.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Trump's solidly East Coast operation appears to be a
good fit in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I'd be giving Donald Trump a reference,'' said
Gary City Hall spokeswoman Sandy Cogan. ``But so far the Trump
organization has been an excellent corporate citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Williams, executive director of the Gary Chamber of
Commerce, agreed: ``The Trump organization has made a significant
impact on this town in more ways than one. They're involved in
many, many, many city and civic organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The casinos contribute hefty contributions to the city's
coffers. They've been a real shot in the arm.''
</P>
<P>
   The company also has awarded hundreds of thousands of dollars in
local scholarships and charitable grants since opening in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Trump officials say Kansas Citians can expect the same pattern
of civic involvement, and perhaps much more.
</P>
<P>
   Trump also is a partner in the revival of a long-abandoned hotel
in downtown Gary. Trump, who built his financial empire on real
estate deals, could take a similar interest in Kansas City real
estate.

   (Kansas City, Mo.: take a similar interest in Kansas City real
estate.)
</P>
<P>
   If so, the property at the top of that list quite likely would
be Richard L. Berkley Riverfront Park, next door to the casino and
developed almost entirely with Flamingo riverboat lease payments,
which Trump will continue to make.
</P>
<P>
   The newly opened public park abuts the Missouri River along a
milelong promenade. An estimated 50 acres on the south side are
being aggressively marketed by the city for development of an
upscale riverview district that would include commercial, retail
and residential projects.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, another company in Trump's web of corporate
entities is developing a remarkably similar property, Trump Place,
on 100 acres along New York's Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   The Port Authority's executive director, Brian Collins, said
Monday that he was aware of the Trump Place project.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting connection,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said he expected to meet with Trump executives next week
for an introductory session. And he expects that Kansas City's
riverside project will come up in the conversation. ``We're
interested in whatever opportunities this new arrangement might
provide,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Will Trump and his traveling entourage become a common sight in
Kansas City?
</P>
<P>
   Don't bet on it, said Allen Kress, a former city planner for
Gary who recently moved to the same post in neighboring Hammond,
Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Trump attended the riverboat's grand opening in 1996, Kress
said, but ``I don't believe he's been back to the boat since.''
</P>
<P>
   Kress said Trump's partner in that twin casino complex, which
shares a dining and entertainment pavilion on Lake Michigan, was a
far more visible and hands-on executive in dealing with the city.
</P>
<P>
   New York City newsman Timothy L. O'Brien, in his 1998 book Bad
Bet, quoted Atlantic City consultant Al Glasgow on the Trump style:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Donald has the patience, or the interest, or the
attention span to be a hands-on operator,'' Glasgow told the
writer. ``He's just a deal maker. He blows in and then he moves on
to the next deal.''
</P>
<P>
   But other East Coast observers say Trump sometimes is seen in
his Atlantic City casinos.
</P>
<P>
   And the effect can be electrifying, said Marvin B. Roffman, now
a Philadelphia investment counselor and stock analyst whose claim
to fame is that he once sued Trump _ and won.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has tremendous charisma,'' Roffman said. ``He will walk
through the casino floor, and people will jump up and try to touch
him.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Roffman lost his job of 17 years with a New York
brokerage after Trump threatened legal action over Roffman's
bearish forecasts for Trump's Taj Mahal casino resort in Atlantic
City.
</P>
<P>
   Roffman's downbeat analysis proved to be correct; the casino
collapsed into early bankruptcy but has since recovered. Roffman
said he sued over his forced dismissal and won confidential
out-of-court settlement payments from both his former employer and
Trump.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must have hit a raw nerve,'' Roffman said recently. ``I hope
I never have to go through that again. ... When you go to battle
against rich and powerful people who have very deep pockets, what
they do is wear you down.''
</P>
<P>
   William Gormley, a New Jersey senator long regarded as a Trump
ally, is another who unexpectedly found himself on the deal maker's
wrong side when he supported legislation for a casino rival.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the GOP incumbent was challenged by an unusually
well-financed political unknown who, The Press of Atlantic City
later reported, had received more than $100,000 in contributions
from contractors and others with close ties to Trump.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey bars casinos and gaming executives from making
political contributions to candidates for state office.
</P>
<P>
   Gormley handily won re-election. And Trump survived a
post-election inquiry by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission
into the questionable campaign donations.
</P>
<P>
   Soon thereafter, the state's rules were changed to close the
loophole that appeared to wink at casino officials' influencing of
the political contributions of others.
</P>
<P>
   Gormley said the experience taught him a valuable lesson about
Trump: ``All the measures I had supported over the years to benefit
Mr. Trump didn't count.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gormley has a grudging admiration for the man.

BANKS ARE READY TO HELP WOMEN IN BUSINESSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILIAN MINCER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whether you're launching a new business or expanding an existing
one, the big question remains the same: How do you get capital?
</P>
<P>
   Women traditionally have avoided loan officers. We'll deplete
our savings accounts, borrow from relatives or max out our credit
cards rather than walk into a bank for a loan. As a result, many of
us miss opportunities because we're undercapitalized.
</P>
<P>
   But as Marlene Abbey of Oz Accommodations knows, banks _
especially small ones _ are in the business of making loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of banks, and they want your business,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Abbey received several small loans before choosing her current
banker. She encourages other consumers to shop around so they can
find someone they feel comfortable with. You need to act out of
strength and realize you can take your business to another bank,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Like many business owners, Abbey also knows from experience that
you can't get a loan without a detailed business plan. A good idea
is not enough. You need to know the market, know how much money you
will need to borrow and know how you will use and repay those
funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never prepare too much,'' agreed Mary Valentine, a
vice president at First National Bank of Olathe. ``Do your
research. Go to small-business workshops. Don't go to a banker
until you're armed with everything you need to pitch your point.''
</P>
<P>
   Numerous resources for writing business plans are available. The
library is a great place to start. Colleges have business centers.
</P>
<P>
   One misconception potential borrowers have is that they can
borrow the entire amount they need.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see a lot of people coming to the bank wanting us to put in
100 percent, and they're not prepared with their share of the
capital injection,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   She said consumers are expected to provide 25 percent to 30
percent of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Another common mistake women make is maxing their credit cards
to finance a business. While that is tempting, loan officers warn
that carrying a lot of debt can be detrimental when you apply for a
bank loan.
</P>
<P>
   Architect Dixie Junk didn't apply for a loan until after her
business was established. But she encouraged other business owners
to get to know a banker long before they need to borrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets down to who believes in you,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And someone who knows you and your track record is more likely
to believe in you.

ANATOLIA'S ANCIENT PORTS OF CALL  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 31) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
  During a memorable cruise along Turkey's Mediterranean coast last
June, I saw Odysseus only in my mind's eye. This was almost odd,
because his presence is palpable among the islets, bays and ancient
ruins that make this trip so rewarding.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here the sea truly is wine-dark and the dawn does have rosy
fingers. It takes almost no imagination at all to envision not only
Odysseus but also Alexander, Cleopatra, Hadrian and other titans of
antiquity gazing on the same sights that await visitors today.
</P>
<P>
   This weeklong trip was a relatively short version of the
Mediterranean ``blue cruise,'' an adventure that is becoming
increasingly popular among travelers who want to combine dazzling
beauty and historical discovery with salt air, seafood, swimming in
pristine coves and simple relaxation.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for these cruises emerged in the late 1950s, initially
as a cultural statement by a group of leftist intellectuals who
forged an ideology they called ``Blue Anatolia.'' It held that
modern Turks are heirs not only to the Turkic culture of Central
Asia but also to the dozens of cultures that have thrived on the
land that is now Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   In the service of this belief, they set out on boat tours along
Turkey's Aegean and Mediterranean coasts, where countless sites
associated with ancient Greece, Rome and other civilizations were
waiting to be discovered _ decades before the explosion of tourism
in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, a modest industry has sprung up to serve those who
make the cruise, based at several ports where motorized wooden
yachts called gulets, designed especially for travel in these
waters, line the harbors.
</P>
<P>
   After deciding to make the trip, my first step was choosing
whether to sign up on one of the vessels that make regularly
scheduled voyages or to put together my own group and charter a
gulet of our own. I chose the latter course and was rewarded by
much good fellowship among a group of 10 adults and three children
in the 8-to-10 age group.
</P>
<P>
   All of us began the trip with unspoken fears that we might feel
uncomfortable trapped aboard a boat together, but just the opposite
turned out to be the case. Friendships were made and deepened, and
each of us was able to decide how much swimming, exploring or
tanning was appropriate each day. The number of books read almost
equaled the number of bottles of Turkish wine consumed with our
savory shipboard dinners.
</P>
<P>
   We began our trip at Antalya, a city of 1.1 million on Turkey's
southern coast that is a jumping-off point for thousands of
tourists each year. Most of them choose simply to find a hotel
somewhere along the coast and spread out a beach towel. But we had
arranged to have Fantezi II waiting for us. It turned out to be a
new 21-meter gulet with a crew of three and seven small cabins,
each with a private bath.
</P>
<P>
   Deciding where along Turkey's long southern coast to concentrate
a cruise is not easy, but the difficulty of the choice is balanced
by the fact that almost any place you choose will prove wonderful.
I had already visited two magnificent sites east of Antalya: the
ruins of ancient Perge and the enormous Roman theater at Aspendos,
which holds more than 15,000 people and is still used in summer for
ballet and opera performances.
</P>
<P>
   This time, therefore, I chose to head west, aiming to travel
along the peninsula that was ancient Lycia (pronounced LISH-uh).
These cities and towns, grouped for centuries into a confederation
called the Lycian League, was at various times under the control of
Greeks, Persians, Egyptians, Romans and even pirates.
</P>
<P>
   It was late afternoon when we set off from Antalya. Warm breezes
quickly began sweeping away the cobwebs that fog the spirits of
those who live under urban pressures. For a few hours we sailed
past beachfront resort colonies, but before dark they thinned out
and we found ourselves gazing at rocky coastlines that seemed all
but unpopulated.
</P>
<P>
   Our reverie was broken by the ring of the ship's dinner bell,
which, as we later noticed, bore the faintly unsettling inscription
``Titanic 1912.'' After consuming a lavish spread of Turkish
appetizers, seafood and fresh fruit, we chose, as many cruising
this coast do, to forsake our stuffy cabins for the mattresses
thoughtfully laid out on the foredeck.
</P>
<P>
   Safely anchored at a placid cove, we slept the sleep of those
Mediterranean voyagers who, unlike Odysseus, can be reasonably
confident that they have done nothing to stir Poseidon's rage.
</P>
<P>
   The next day we stopped at the only site on our itinerary that I
had already visited, the ruins of Phaselis. I welcomed the chance
to return, because Phaselis is one of my favorite spots in Turkey.
It is not only remarkably well preserved but also conveys a vivid
sense of what it must have been like to live in antiquity.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently founded by colonists from Rhodes in the seventh
century B.C., it quickly became a trading center rich enough to
have its own mint, which not surprisingly produced coins depicting
ships and nautical scenes. There is no museum on the site, and no
guide, just a small souvenir stand where visitors may buy snacks
and guidebooks.
</P>
<P>
   It is a far cry from the bustling days when Alexander spent
several months at Phaselis around 334 B.C., preferring it to other
towns in the region partly because he was deeply moved by the sight
of its most impressive historic artifact, a broken spear supposedly
used by Achilles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The extraordinarily beautiful town had three harbors, straight
avenues, a theater and squares,'' he wrote. ``Although it was
winter, roses were in bloom everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Phaselis' broad main street, paved with cut stones, is lined
with ruins of many structures including a gymnasium that opens onto
a public bath, a long Roman aqueduct, a gate dedicated to Hadrian,
and most impressively, a classically proportioned theater with 20
rows of stone seats.
</P>
<P>
   When I was there a large tortoise was all that moved on what had
been the stage, but when I closed my eyes I thought I heard a
toga-clad poet chanting tales of seafaring heroes. Cleopatra is
said to have visited here, and one could easily imagine her in one
of the box seats.
</P>
<P>
   For the next several days we based ourselves at Kas, a lovely
town with a fine harbor that makes it a favorite of gulets and
other yachts. On the way we visited a Lycian necropolis at Myra and
the nearby Church of St. Nicholas, built in the 11th century and
heavily restored. Both were interesting, but the site has been
overrun with tourists on the Santa Claus trail. With so many
choices on this coast, we decided to move to lesser-known places.

 UNDATED: known places.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the days passed, we found another force breezing through our
group along with the warm trade winds. Our enthusiasm for
exploration, climbing and hiking slowly ebbed as the warm water and
hours of unalloyed relaxation worked their seductive power.
</P>
<P>
   While it is fine to begin such trips with a determination to
trek and discover, such resolve is likely to weaken as days pass.
But we had not turned completely indolent, and in Kas were the
beneficiary of new inspiration in the form of John Ash, a
British-born poet and Byzantine historian whom we had prevailed
upon to fly down from his home in Istanbul to guide us for a couple
of days.
</P>
<P>
   He took us first to an idyllic seaside village called Ucagiz,
formerly known as Theimiussa. There we dined at a fine seafood
restaurant with a view so enchanting that it moved two Turkish
members of our group, mother and daughter, to ask for folk music on
the cassette player; they then proceeded to demonstrate their
mastery of belly dancing.
</P>
<P>
   After lunch we hiked past the edge of town to a Lycian
necropolis. The Lycians built their tombs above ground, some of
them carved into the sides of cliffs and others as free-standing
granite structures. Some are carved with elaborate inscriptions,
and on one we distinctly made out the words ``Hey Boy,'' leading us
to dub it the Hey Boy Sarcophagus.
</P>
<P>
   On our way back to the boat we stopped at the ruins of what had
once been a grand home or palace, its imposing doorway arch intact.
</P>
<P>
   A short boat ride from Ucagiz lies the village of Simena, where
the most prominent landmark is a handsome Lycian sarcophagus that
was built on land but now, with changes in the water level, rises
from the shallow harbor about 50 feet from shore. After anchoring
near it, we climbed a steep hill to a well-preserved Byzantine
fortress built on the ruins of one from Lycian times.
</P>
<P>
   From the summit there was a spectacular view of wooded islands
dotting the multicolored sea. On the way down we stopped to admire
the smallest ancient theater I have ever seen, carved from rock in
a neat semicircle and big enough for about 250 people. Perhaps it
was an Off Broadway tryout center where stand-up bards honed their
skills for the big time at Phaselis and Aspendos.
</P>
<P>
   During our numerous swimming breaks we saw submerged remains of
several ancient towns, but resisted the temptation to join a trip
in a glass-bottom boat or, even more adventurous, a scuba diving
tour. We were, however, intrigued by Ash's assurance that there are
dozens of magnificent sites in this area that are not mentioned in
any guidebook, and challenged him to prove it. He did so most
impressively.
</P>
<P>
   When the minibus he chartered arrived at the Kas harbor the next
morning, we voted unanimously to postpone our trip because the heat
was already intense. The bus returned late in the afternoon, and we
proceeded to a spot about 35 miles north, near the village of
Dirgenler. We parked at the foot of a deep canyon, which Ash said
was the only pass in a chain of mountains near the Tarsus range.
</P>
<P>
   Lycian villagers moved inland to this region to escape seafaring
raiders beginning in the eighth century A.D. To defend their homes
they built an imposing fortress overlooking the chasm below. We did
not climb to the fortress, but walked about a mile along the cliff
on a road cut by Romans.
</P>
<P>
   Near this Roman road, in the middle of a verdant valley, Ash led
us through a farmer's yard and past a herd of grazing goats to the
glorious ruin of a very large Byzantine church. Towers and walls
are still standing, along with two octagonal chambers on opposite
corners. We were told that they are all but unique in Turkey and
that their purpose remains obscure.
</P>
<P>
   The size and dignity of the structure, the rich colors of the
surrounding landscape, and the sense that very few outsiders have
seen this place in recent centuries combined to make the experience
deeply moving.
</P>
<P>
   By this time the last remnants of pollution and stress were
purged from the psyches of everyone aboard. We still had a couple
of days left, and we stopped at several small coves. There we swam
and viewed a few more ancient sites, among them a Roman bath that
is now half-submerged and thus once again available for bathing.
</P>
<P>
   Several times we were visited by a skiff carrying a local man
and his son who peddle ice cream to passengers on visiting boats.
His prices were double those ashore, but we were willing buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Before ending our voyage we stopped at the town of Fethiye,
which in ancient times was famous for soothsayers. I didn't find
one, but if I had, I suspect he or she would have predicted that
most of my companions and I would sooner or later be drawn back to
Blue Anatolia. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you go &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many companies have sprung up to offer versions of the blue
cruise, either as brokers or actual vessel operators. Some charge
exorbitant prices, such as one based in London with which I first
negotiated. The best way to organize trips is through an American
travel agency that regularly sends clients to Turkey _ try Pasha
Tours at (212) 764-4080 _ or directly with cruise operators in
southern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The company from which my friends and I rented our gulet,
Fantezi, may be telephoned in Antalya beginning in the spring at
(90-242) 814-6233. Other reliable operators based in Bodrum include
Aegean Yacht Services, (90-252) 316-1517, fax (90-252) 316-5749,
and Alesta Yachting and Travel, (90-252) 612-3054, fax (90-252)
614-2571; and Dolphin, (90-242) 248-4040, fax (90-242) 248-4538, in
Antalya.
</P>
<P>
   Prices vary widely according to the month, length of trip and
size and type of vessel. Aegean's prices range from $200 daily for
a modest six-cabin vessel with crew in April or November to $6,500
daily for a deluxe 18-cabin vessel in July and August. Alesta's
range from $280 daily for a four-cabin gulet in May or October to
$1,440 daily for a 10-cabin ketch at peak season.
</P>
<P>
   The crew normally includes a cook who buys food and prepares all
meals, but prices do not include the cost of food or drinks. It's
customary to tip crewmen at the end of a trip; we gave each of our
three crewmen $100.

   HKN-ORR-BURE _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ There's no mistaking the

Whether he's talking about his admiration for new Florida Panther

former NHL superstar and Tequesta resident speaks with joyous
passion about his favorite game. (Tays, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   FBN-ELWAY-REEVES _ John Elway ran Dan Reeves out of Denver. All
Reeves did while he was there was coach Elway and the Broncos to
four Super Bowls. What's behind the sour relationship between the
two and what is current Denver coach Mike Shanahan's role in it?
(Woods, Palm Beach Post).
</P>
<P>
   FBN-MORTANDERSEN _ Morten Andersen has been a stellar kicker in
the NFL for a long time. But until he made the overtime field goal

best known for blowing an easy kick in 1996 that allowed the
Jacksonville Jaguars to make the playoffs for the first time.

writes about Denver's controversial tight end Shannon Sharpe.
(Archdeacon, Dayton Daily News).
</P>
<P>
   FBN-CERRABINO-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ For the first
time in its 33-year history, the Super Bowl will be played while an
impeached American president is on trial in the U.S. Senate. You
may think this is coincidental. You may even imagine that the two
events, each of them grand spectacles on the American stage, have
no connections or similarities. But you probably haven't given this
as much thought as I have. If you did, you'd see that the
connection between these two pageants might seem tenuous at first.
But not when you take a deeper look. (Cerrabino, Palm Beach Post)
MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   FBN-SHARPE-COX _ The goal is to find out what Denver Broncos
tight end Shannon Sharpe was like before he got to the NFL, before
he had the nerve to call Dan Marino ``a loser,'' before he baited
Kansas City's Derrick Thomas into a Monday Night meltdown, before
he left a trail of angry fans on the road to Super Bowl XXXIII.
(Woods, Palm Beach Post). MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   FBN-NAMATH-GUARANTEE _ MIAMI _ It's been 30 years since the
quarterback, dressed in a soft green suit, grabbed food and a beer
at the New York Jets' poolside barbecue at the Galt Ocean Mile
Hotel in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and entered a limousine headed for
Miami Springs. Details of the next four hours have been colored by
three decades of interpretation and exaggeration, by the several
hundred who came to Dade County's primo spot to crown Namath ``the
Outstanding Professional Football Player of 1968.'' But this can be
guaranteed: Namath made sport's most famous guarantee that night,
predicting the Jets, at the time 19-point underdogs, would upset
the Baltimore Colts. ``It was typical Joe,'' said New York Times
columnist Dave Anderson, who chronicled the Jets' week in the 1969
book Countdown to Super Bowl. ``You knew he might say anything. He
had been saying things like that all week, he just didn't use the
word guarantee.'' (Skolnick, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Every once in a while, the performing arts come up
with a whole new category. Music, having explored the concert, the
opera and the liederabend, now brings us the master class: the solo
recital with a difference. Thomas Hampson and Marilyn Horne starred
in their own master class productions just recently at the
Juilliard Theater. Leontyne Price, Roberta Peters, Regine Crespin,
Joan Sutherland and Elly Ameling had preceded them, and Sherrill
Milnes takes the boards next week.
</P>
<P>
   The raging success of Terrence McNally's ``Master Class'' on
Broadway a few years back, with Zoe Caldwell as McNally's version
of Maria Callas, has made the real thing more attractive to
everyone concerned: organizers able to win new audiences, the
audiences themselves hoping to bask in insider wisdom, and the
teachers, too. Hampson is in his prime as a singer, but most of his
colleagues in this highly public educational endeavor are not.
Retired or retiring divas quite naturally miss their old ardent
following, and through the master class the public is made to
remember and show respect.
</P>
<P>
   Should we worry that McNally's entertainment had little to do
with teaching and almost nothing to do with music? I think not.
Playwrights deal with people's heads and insides, not breath
support. The private soul of Callas was turned inside out in the
quasi-fantasy of ``Master Class,'' with self-absorption as public
rant and daydreams said out loud.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Master Class'' exaggerates the facts, it does get close to
uncomfortable truths: that the true exercise of its subject matter
is more about the teacher than the taught, that its format assures
that even with the best of intentions the student is the least
important element involved.
</P>
<P>
   Callas aficionados probably remember every recorded word she
uttered during her famous master classes at the Juilliard School in
1972, but I don't think any of them know who her momentary pupils
were, nor do they really care. Maybe they were not much good and
not worth remembering, but in name at least this event was about
them.
</P>
<P>
   For the uninitiated, the musical master class is an odd
combination of show business and personal tutoring whereby a series
of students _ singers, pianists, violinists, for example _ play or
sing briefly over the course of a few hours and receive brief words
of wisdom from the master in attendance. He or she is customarily a
performer of stature, though occasionally a star teacher. The
transaction takes place before an audience, often a paying one.
</P>
<P>
   Promised is a win-win-win situation. The student learns. The
master shows not only depth of learning but also compassion for
one's inferiors. The music lover in the seats sees a bit of music
from the inside out and learns the tips and tidbits that apparently
turn dross into gold. There is also the flattering feeling among
audience members that they are in on the teaching. After specific
ministrations to a singer, Hampson often turned to the orchestra
seats, asking, ``Do you hear the difference?'' En masse, listeners
beamed in complicity even if they didn't hear it.
</P>
<P>
   It is the audience that changes everything. Whom are they there
to pay attention to? If you say the student and the music, I don't
think you are being honest. The master class is first of all about
an audience and a star. The equation goes something like this:
Performing artist is to song what master class teacher is to
student. The singer interprets the song; the master class singing
teacher interprets the student.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the purpose is to stimulate a public. Not that
teachers don't care about what or whom they are teaching; not that
students don't sometimes learn. Good things happen: secrets are
passed, changes made.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the exceptional sound will disrupt the normal process.
One young woman at Ms. Horne's morning session sang with a quality
that made me forget everything else. But students in this situation
will always be props in another, more prominent show going on
beside them.
</P>
<P>
   Hampson and Ms. Horne were very different teachers. He a general
principles man, she a line-by-line editor. In matters of posture
and mental preparation, Hampson often repeated himself. This is
less interesting for an audience always wanting something new, but
it spoke of basic values that students can call upon when no
teacher is around. I liked a lot of them, especially the formula
for overly aggressive interpreters: ``Don't go looking for passion;
make it come to you.'' This is an image as valuable to pianists or
violinists as it is to singers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Horne was concerned with the song at hand: how to phrase
each line, alter tempos, place accents, extend breaths. She tells
students that these are her private decisions and not necessarily
those of others, but it is very clear that she expects to get what
she wants. If I were a singer preparing Wolf's ``Kennst du das
Land'' or ``In dem Schatten Meiner Locken'' for the public, I would
make a beeline for Ms. Horne. If I were looking for broader values
that would fit in my pocket anywhere I went, I think I'd talk to
Hampson.
</P>
<P>
   McNally's Broadway success happily tossed music aside, isolated
the master class' element of stardom and let it run wild. With road
shows and translations beckoning, stars like Faye Dunaway leaped at
the opportunity to play the part; and where more easily could one
give legitimate vent to one's own natural imperiousness? Audiences
love to watch a big ego ignite, and divalike actresses have had the
chance to play themselves without fear of embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   McNally's theatrical students were real singers, but
dramaturgically they were the movable walls off which the diva
bounced her speeches. In the theater we expect hyperbole, and we
got it. A musician will find very little recognizable in the
teacher of ``Master Class,'' but the students portrayed are another
matter. They, and the way they are used, are often dead on.
</P>
<P>
   The teaching process is customarily binary. The teacher teaches,
and the student learns. (In the healthiest situations both teach
and both learn.) Master classes dilute the transaction by
introducing outsiders. For what was previously an exchange of
information becomes a three-way dance. It is the students who play
and sing, but make no mistake, it is the masters of these master
classes who are ``on.'' The audience rules. Every role is played
out for its benefit.
</P>
<P>
   As public stimulation, the master class is first-rate
entertainment. As a learning device, it is seriously compromised.
For the teacher is sending out beams in two directions
simultaneously: toward the student and toward those watching the
teacher and the student. There is simply not enough energy to
sustain both beams.
</P>
<P>
   Master classes are fun. We should go to them, buy our tickets
and have a good time. But be careful, lest you confuse them with
higher education.

`MR. DARWIN'S SHOOTER': A DARWIN ASSISTANT WITH HINTS OF INDIANA
JONES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(lb) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scattered here and there in the copious diaries and letters of
Charles Darwin are mentions of a certain Syms Covington. ``My
servant,'' Darwin called him, continuing in one reference, ``I do
not very much like him; but he is, perhaps from his very oddity,
very well adapted to all my purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Covington, who was born to a laboring family in Bedford,
England, and died in Australia not long after the publication of
Darwin's ``Origin of Species'' in 1859, is the inspiration for
Roger McDonald's new novel, ``Mr. Darwin's Shooter,'' a
high-spirited, adventuresome, idiosyncratic ramble through the
history of science that certainly captures the ``oddity'' that
Darwin spoke of.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Darwin's Shooter'' is, in other words, a fictionalized
biography of a figure about whom the available historical
documentation would probably not permit a full-scale nonfiction
treatment. At the heart of McDonald's book is a picaresque
novelization of the years that Covington spent with Darwin in South
America during the famed voyage of the Beagle in the 1830s.
</P>
<P>
   The Covington of McDonald's novel collected specimens for
Darwin. He roamed Patagonia and other places in search of animals
and birds, and along the way he got involved in Indiana Jones-like
scrapes and romances: Indiana Jones with a briny 19th-century
flavor and a lack of scholarly understanding.
</P>
<P>
   The Covington of ``Mr. Darwin's Shooter'' is distinguished by an
understandable failure to realize that he is working for one of the
greatest scientific thinkers of his century; his religious beliefs
also lead him to be troubled by the thrust of his master's
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   As McDonald shapes Covington's semi-imaginary life, he rubs up
against the Big Questions that Darwin's theory raised, expressed by
McDonald in an earthily poetic vernacular.
</P>
<P>
   Stumbling over the ``black lava'' of the Galapagos Islands,
where ``the most old-fashioned antediluvian animals'' can be found,
Darwin and Covington are startled by what they see: ``proof that
God's hand sizzled here with one thing, there with another, and the
chambers of his gallery were infinite in their on-going.''
</P>
<P>
   Darwin himself is a powerful figure who fills up the background
space of McDonald's book, but it is the rough-and-tumble, querulous
figure of Covington who dominates the foreground.
</P>
<P>
   We first meet him when he is a teen-ager in Bedford in 1828,
leaving home in the company of a kind of seagoing, born-again
Congregationalist named John Phipps. Later we see him near the end
of his life, living as a prosperous agricultural entrepreneur in
Australia, raising a brood of children and anxiously awaiting a
copy of ``Origin of Species,'' wondering if he will be mentioned in
the acknowledgments.
</P>
<P>
   Covington becomes friends with a doctor-adventurer named
MacCracken, originally from Boston, and it is through MacCracken's
often astonished eyes that we view Covington: physically scarred,
nearly deaf, furiously righteous, and raging against the
theological implications of Darwin's theory.
</P>
<P>
   ```Non-creation,' said Covington, `is the idea that the Garden
of Eden and the Flood of Noah are merely stories men tell each
other .... Non-creation is the notion that there's been more time
on earth than any mortal is able to calculate, and that those who
love the Bible are fools. One such a fool stands before you,
MacCracken.'''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald alternates between the later Covington and the youthful
one of the Darwin years, with both periods well grounded in
historical detail. We experience Covington as a member of a family
of horse butchers in England, then follow him on board ships to
South America in the company of the evangelizing Phipps, and in his
job as bird-shooter in Argentina, where he explains to his paramour
the method of skinning a winged specimen so that the feathers
remain undisturbed.
</P>
<P>
   Covington's relationship with Darwin is cleverly imagined, seen
mostly from Covington's point of view, but always comically
marinated in the deep differences between the two men: one an
advantaged, understated genius, the other a coarser, more desperate
figure caught between the need to please and the need to assert his
self-respect.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Darwin complains at one point of some samples Covington brought
him from the fields and skies of Argentina: ``But you have too many
of the same kind. What is this?''
</P>
<P>
   Covington replies, ``It came skimmin' along the water.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it is half shot away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A pinch is better than a peck, ain't that right?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not in the case of birds, I am afraid,'' Darwin says.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald, who is an Australian writer of poems, travel essays
and screenplays as well as several novels, shows a knack not only
for a pungent sort of historical reconstruction but also for
characters of craggy fragility.
</P>
<P>
   His MacCracken _ a man who recognized ``that a point in his life
had arrived when he was tired of who he was, and had come to feel a
flimsiness of character running right through to the physical'' _
would be a good candidate for best literary supporting character of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   And Covington's alternation between a self-protective obedience
and brash independence of spirit makes for a spicy study in
19th-century class awareness.
</P>
<P>
   By the time we see him late in his life in Australia, a crusty,
monied paterfamilias with a penchant for absolutist gestures, we
feel we understand the origin of the species known as Covington.
And when, thinking about John Phipps and Charles Darwin and a
certain Mrs. Fitzpatrick whom he met on the pampas, Covington faces
his end, it is with an elegiac courage that seems to be the sum of
all of the man's many parts and experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no words in Covington's lexicon to pin himself
down,'' McDonald writes. ``He was a man of action _ yet strangled
by philosophy you might say.'' Fortunately, McDonald's lexicon was
equal to the task of summoning up out of facts and admiration a
character you are not likely soon to forget.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sex isn't sexy anymore. This has become a glum and
widely accepted fact of cultural life in these United States, where
people tend to gag and reach for the remote when another graphic
description of Presidential activity emerges from the television.
Even the New York theater, hardly known in recent years for keeping
its fingers on the national pulse, is reflecting this sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   Check out, if you can find a ticket, ``The Blue Room,'' David
Hare's comic drama of copulation and its discontents, on Broadway
at the Cort Theater. Do you think that the 10 erotically entwined
characters played by Nicole Kidman and Iain Glen are having any
fun? For that matter, is the audience? Or take a look at the
Broadway dance show ``Fosse,'' a celebration of the great
sensualist choreographer Bob Fosse, in which the saucy Fosse style
is delivered with empty-eyed, robotic athleticism. The thrill is
gone. And don't even ask about ``Footloose,'' the sanitized gym
class of a musical about teen-agers in love.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to have a good time at a play about sex, you might
do better in the experimental hinterlands of Off Broadway.
Specifically, you might take a look at Richard Foreman's ``Paradise
Hotel,'' an abstruse but very lively study of carnal appetites by
the Ontological-Hysteric Theater at St. Mark's Church. Of course,
you should know that its essential premise is that sex really isn't
sexy, something the performance fully confirms. But at least the
show is up front about its intentions, and it manages to generate
considerable wit and energy in carrying them out.
</P>
<P>
   Foreman has been the reigning philosopher vaudevillian of the
New York avant-garde for three decades now, creating fractured
dreamscapes in which life is the banana cream pie that keeps
hitting you in the face. His starting point is that the world is
unknowable, self is a question mark, and existence is one long
chain of frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   His plays are always, on one level, the same; yet Foreman slyly
varies them in ways that reflect the shifting society outside,
unknowable though it may be. The execution of his shows, from their
phantasmagorical sets to their displacing use of sound, remains as
polished and precise as a Disney production, and somehow he
continues to invest existential anxiety with the adolescent vigor
of Alanis Morissette in her pre-spiritual days.
</P>
<P>
   Sex has always been a component of Foreman's work, one of the
many guy wires that trip up his hapless, questing characters. The
subject took center stage last year with his ``Benita Canova,''
which presented a Balthusian girls' school of cunning, sadistic
little vixens. ``Paradise Hotel,'' however, is his baldest
consideration of the erotic impulse. In it, sex is something that
everybody talks about and nobody does anything about. Think of a
speeded-up, plotless Eric Rohmer movie directed by Mack Sennett,
and you start to approach the mind-set of ``Paradise Hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the hotel of the title has another name. That
is a common four-letter Anglo-Saxon word for sexual congress, a
word that is repeated over and over and in assorted contexts by the
evening's five principal characters. Whether used as a verb, a noun
or an epithet, the word would seem to have a talismanic power for
its speakers, a promise of transporting erotic activity.
</P>
<P>
   Not a chance. Like Chekhov's mopey provincial sisters pining for
Moscow, Foreman's sex seekers think that life would be dandy if
they could only arrive at that hotel, a palace of carnal delights.
But they never get there, or if they do, they don't know it.
Anyway, it seems that the Paradise Hotel is always threatening to
turn into the Hotel of Beautiful Roses, a place in which raw sex
becomes merely sentimental.
</P>
<P>
   That's the plot, and it's actually a lot of plot by Foreman's
standards. It all transpires in a cluttered room in which clocks,
golden baby dolls, skulls and all manner of overhead lighting
fixtures can be discerned, as well as a sinister floating gorilla,
whose presence is never referred to. The overall effect is as if
paintings by Fragonard and Magritte had caught fire and melted into
one another.
</P>
<P>
   A chorus of hard-bitten, black-clad flapper types dance to the
repeated phrase ``I'm happy, you're happy.'' A mysterious,
exquisite naked woman, her head wrapped in cloth, briefly
materializes, though none of the fellows dare touch her. Also
making fleeting appearances are a small effigy of the hotel itself,
which is most frustrating since nobody could possibly go inside it,
and a large, carnivorous bag of dirty shoes. People fall down a
lot, commit suicide, come back to life and employ measuring tapes
in vain hopes of quantifying the chaos around them.
</P>
<P>
   Are you following this? As usual with Foreman, what seems merely
pretentious and perverse in the telling feels perfectly logical
when you're watching it. The actors create highly individualized
cartoons, from Tom Pearl's film-noir-style tough guy to Juliana
Francis' intense Slavic vamp.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Wilmes is alternately a Louis XIV-like king with a scepter
of a phallus and an insinuating bellboy who seems to know what's
going on, while Jay Smith has a softer side that makes his
metamorphosis into a rose garden understandable. Tony Torn, who has
a Jackie Gleason-like girth and air of exasperation, bravely takes
on the full-nudity duties. Suffice it to say it is nothing like the
fashionable nudity in ``The Blue Room.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Paradise Hotel'' isn't subtle, even at its most opaque. And
some of Foreman's philosophical assertions, like discussions of
self as excrement, sound like old-fashioned shock theater. But he
has such a confident sense of theatrical rhythm that you listen to
his language as though it were repartee by Noel Coward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody reads my mind past page one,'' snarls one of the men in
``Paradise Hotel.'' Actually, nobody reads anybody's mind in
Foreman's world. His characters are deeply unsure of what their own
thoughts are, and even lust is hard to distinguish from what one of
them describes as ``a web of superimposed appetites.'' But Foreman
keeps making clear, bright theater out of all this murk. And he
definitely does unsexy sex with more passion than anyone else in
town.

 &HT;    POPE CHALLENGES AMERICAN POLICIES ON ABORTION, ASSISTED DEATH
 &HT;    540&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By Bob Deans
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ His own legacy tainted by scandal, President Clinton
on Tuesday paid tribute to the moral heroism of one of the most
towering spiritual figures of the 20th Century, praising Pope John
Paul II for his ''limitless faith,'' and his role in the
''revolution of values and spirit'' that helped end the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The Pope, in his seventh visit to the United States, responded
with a direct challenge to American policies on some of the most
divisive political dilemmas of the age, including abortion,
euthanasia and racial equality.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving here from Mexico for a two-day visit to this hub of
heartland Catholicism, the pontiff summoned the echoes of American
slavery, saying that ''After untold suffering, and with enormous
effort, that situation has, at least in part, been reversed.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the country now stands at the brink of a new social
divide that pits the interests of spiritually-centered Americans
against groups that lack ''a higher moral vision.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Today the conflict is between a culture that affirms,
cherishes and celebrates the gift of life, and a culture that seeks
to declare entire groups of human beings _ the unborn, the
terminally ill, the handicapped, and others considered unuseful _
to be outside the boundaries of legal protection,'' the Pope said.
''Only a higher moral vision can motivate the choice for life.''
</P>
<P>
   His remarks were met with cheers and applause from an audience
of several thousand people who turned out at the Lambert St. Louis
International Airport, chanting at many times, ''We love you, John
Paul two.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who journeyed here on a day when the fate of his office
continued to hang in the balance as the Senate presided over his
impeachment trial hundreds of miles away, did not respond directly
to the Pope's message, delivered in a hangar normally reserved for
F-15 warplanes flown by the Missouri Air National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the president looked on as the aging pontiff spoke,
slowly and deliberately, his head bowed toward his text, in
heavily-accented English.
</P>
<P>
   Retiring to a small room for a private, 20-minute meeting with
the Pope afterward, Clinton told reporters it was ''a great joy,''
to meet with the spiritual leader of the world's 1 billion Roman
Catholics - half of all Christians on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ''He reminds us to think of the people, not just the governments
of other countries, but the people of other countries,'' Clinton
said. ''That's an important thing for an American president to keep
in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   During the private meeting, the Pope raised a host of American
policy issues over which the White House and the Vatican are split.
</P>
<P>
   Among those was the U.S. policy of containing Iraq, using
military force and economic sanctions the Pope has criticized as
harmful to Iraqi citizens.
</P>
<P>
   They also spoke of Cuba - where the Pope visited last year in an
effort to spotlight continuing human rights abuses and poverty
under more than three decades of rule by Communist leader Fidel
Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ''They both agreed that the progress to date has been very hard
fought and very small,'' P.J. Crowley, press spokesman for the
National Security Council, told reporters here after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In the two men's fourth meeting, the Pope also raised the
abortion issue, though Crowley insisted the matter was tangential
to the broader discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ''The pontiff's views on the respect for dignity and human life
are well-known,'' Crowley said. ''It did come up in passing.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidently weary from his travels, the Pope, 78, cut out a long
paragraph from the prepared text of his public remarks, eliminating
a powerful plea for global peace and economic equality, as well as
a bid for an international land-mine ban that Clinton has declined
to sign.
</P>
<P>
   He extended his blessings to all of the country's 61 million
Catholics, as well as to ''people of all religions and for every
person of good will.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hailed the life and work of the Pope, a native of Poland
who became supreme pontiff in 1978, has championed human rights
around the world, lent spiritual inertia to the Polish worker's
movement that helped usher in the demise of the Soviet Union, and
survived a gunshot wound by a would-be assassin in 1981 and an
attempted knifing the following year.
</P>
<P>
   ''For 20 years, you have lifted our spirits and touched our
hearts,'' Clinton said. ''Through it all you have given of yourself
with a boundless physical energy, which can only find its source in
limitless faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton praised the pontiff's efforts to bring about the end of
the Cold War, and for ''standing for human dignity, human rights
and religious freedom'' around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''We honor you for helping to lead a revolution of values and
spirit in Central Europe and the former Soviet Union, freeing
millions to live by conscience, not coercion, and freeing all of us
from the constant fear of nuclear war,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''People still need to hear your message that all are God's
children, all have fallen short of His glory,'' Clinton said, and
''all the injustices of yesterday cannot excuse a single injustice
today.''
</P>
<P>
   As strong as the public words of either man, however, was the
stark symbolism inherent in the meeting between Clinton, the
scandal-tarnished 42nd president of the world's last remaining
superpower, and the aging Vicar of Christ, the 264th supreme
pontiff in a line stretching back nearly 2,000 years to the
disciple of Jesus, St. Peter.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to emerge from a year of political purgatory, Clinton
journeyed here in what was, in some respect, the ultimate stop
along the road to redemption he embarked upon publicly last
September with his White House admission that ''I have sinned.''
</P>
<P>
   And, while administration aides insisted that Tuesday's brief
private meeting was focused on such policy matters as Iraq, Kosovo
and world poverty, the president's admitted personal failings
couldn't have been far from each leader's mind.
</P>
<P>
   The Pope, after all, has put the need for morally-based
governance at the heart of his mission throughout a career that has
spanned half a century of global turmoil and suffering at the hands
of misguided political and military leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''Against the delusion that has made such a mess of the 20th
Century - mainly that politics and economics is what runs the world
- the Pope has insisted that what really motors history is culture,
is moral conviction, in particular, religiously-influenced moral
conviction,'' said the Bethesda, Md.-based theologian George
Weigel, author of a biography of the Pope, entitled ''Witness to
Hope,'' due out later this year. ''He can only be understood as a
thoroughly convinced Christian disciple.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's public reception was clearly the Pope's event, as
evidenced by the response of the several thousand people who came
bearing tickets distributed by local parish administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether she was more excited about seeing Clinton or the
pontiff, Deborah Dell responded ''The Pope - but it's kind of an
added extra seeing the president.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her family hadn't been able to avoid speculation about
the unique circumstances of Clinton's meeting with the Pope, their
first meeting since the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''My husband and I joked a little bit about it,'' said Dell, who
brought her two daughters, Melissa, 14, and Kristen, 10, to
Tuesday's event. ''We'd kind of like to know what the Pope would
say to the president about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she paused, added that her family supports the president,
and shrugged, ''We all make mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no mixed emotions, either, for Lisa Portilla, who, in
shades of Biblical stories of the infirm being taken to Jesus,
braved crowds to bring her son Gregory, 3, who is wheelchair-bound
due to a development disorder.
</P>
<P>
   She was rewarded for her faith when Clinton led the Pope to the
young boy, whom the pontiff leaned over and blessed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't tell you what it meant when the Pope touched his
head,'' Portilla gushed afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're looking for divine intervention, this is the place
to be,'' she said. ''I'm not necessarily expecting a miracle, but
I'm sure hoping for one.''

SENATE SHOULD LIMIT TIME FOR WITNESSES  
 (ADV: THIS EDITORIAL WILL APPEAR IN THE JAN. 27 ARIZONA REPUBLIC) 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Democrats are clamoring to dismiss the case against
President Clinton. Even most Americans who believe Clinton is
guilty think he should stay in office. With the impeachment trial
now in its third week, many Republicans are looking for ways to
bring it to a close without short-circuiting the process and
violating constitutional procedures.
</P>
<P>
   We applaud those efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The decisions the Senate makes today on whether it takes
depositions from witnesses, requires them to take the stand in the
Senate chamber or hears no witnesses at all will be crucial in
deciding when and how this trial ends.
</P>
<P>
   Even some conservative Republicans are urging closure. Said Sen.
Richard Shelby of Alabama: ``Let's close this thing out. Let's vote
on it, up or down.''
</P>
<P>
   But if enough senators disagree with Shelby to prolong the
trial, as seems likely, we offer another suggestion: Give each side
time to call witnesses, but make the time limited and then enforce
the limits.
</P>
<P>
   This would follow the pattern set when the Senate limited each
side's opening arguments. Give the House managers, say, two days to
put on their best witnesses. Then give the White House two days to
put on theirs. Both sides know going in what the time frame is and
can plan their strategies accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   The important thing is that the trial not be allowed to drag on
for weeks. Nobody - especially not Republicans - has anything to
gain from prolonging the process. Witnesses from both sides could
be heard in a week.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the value in guiding the process to closure is the
public's disinterest. The public is disengaged - so disengaged, in
fact, that the Senate meeting in secret sessions on Monday and
Tuesday drew a big yawn. That's a shame. The forum should have be
open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   We are disappointed that Arizona Sens. John McCain and Jon Kyl
supported secret deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   It's the public's business the Senate is conducting, after all.
</P>
<P>
   Senators would be wise to remember that. &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Record to near-record low temperatures will chill parts of
central California early Wednesday morning in the wake of a Pacific
disturbance that brought rain, snow and thunderstorms to the state
on Tuesday. Because the system merely brushed the California coast
early Tuesday when weather balloons were launched over land, a
reliable gauge of its maximum strength was not possible. However,
based on the shape and texture of the system's clouds on satellite
imagery, the system was and will be rather formidable.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the sluggish but potent disturbance will bring snow
to the mountains of Arizona and western New Mexico as it presses
eastward. Later Wednesday night or Thursday, rain and thunderstorms
will develop across parts of Texas as the east-bound system draws
increasingly moist air northward from the Gulf of Mexico. Strong
thunderstorms are possible.
</P>
<P>
   The storm system that produced three inches of snow at
Bakersfield, Calif., on Monday (which marked only the third
measurable snow in the city's history) will weaken as it crosses
the upper Middle West. A stripe of light to moderate snow will fall
from Michigan's upper peninsula across parts of northern Minnesota
into North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   Across the central Gulf Coast and Southeast States, a trend
toward record warmth will begin Wednesday as a warm high-pressure
system expands northward from Florida. Warmth will spread to the
Middle Atlantic States, but it will not be able to reach New
England as Canadian air builds into the region later Wednesday and
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Winter Spouts
</P>
<P>
   Rotating motions detected by radar in thunderstorm clouds led
forecasters to alert mariners for possible waterspouts off the
southern California coast on Monday. Though there were no confirmed
reports, winter is the season for offshore twisters in California.
Waterspouts form when cold air overlies relatively warm water.
These unstable conditions encourage fast-rising currents of air
that, given a weak spin in the atmosphere, can lead to the
formation of a waterspout. With air temperatures at 20,000 feet
near 20 degrees and sea temperatures near 60 degrees, conditions
were ripe for waterspouts.

Wednesday on the witness question and a Democratic request to

join Democrats had evaporated and he expected party-line votes on
both issues. (Foskett , Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

AMWEST (Phoenix) - Phoenix Mayor Skip Rimsza is scrambling to see
what Phoenix can to do keep America West Airlines here. He's
reminding airline officials of the $466 million the city's poured
into airport improvements - many of them to directly benefit the
hometown airline. He's trying to get the mayors of Columbus, Ohio
and Las Vegas to join with him in ensuring the three hub cities
speak with one voice on America West's fortunes, and on Tuesday he
reminded federal Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater of the
city's concern about keeping the airline here. Slater's opinion is
vital in any anti-trust review of airline mergers by the Department
of Justice. And the mayor talked to Southwest Airlines about his
strategy. Rimsza said he was blindsided by United's announcement
last week that it was looking at buying America West. Just six days
earlier, the mayor said, AmWest officials were in his office,
pushing him to speed up airport-expansion projects that would aid
the airline. By MARY JO PITZL. Story will move in the ``F''

SOMMER-OBIT (Undated) - Frederick Sommer died Saturday in Prescott,
Ariz. He was 94. Sommer was the most important artist living in
Arizona, with a world-wide reputation (he had a one-man show at the
Getty a few years ago) and was friends with such important names as
Max Ernst, Edward Weston and Charles Sheeler. He was not an artist
that the public knew widely, but was revered by other artists, and
was one of those highly innovative people who generate ideas that
others later feed off of. By RICHARD NILSEN. Story will move in the

 &QL; 
AIRPORT-GOLF (Phoenix) - The rich, as you may have heard, are not
like you and me. For one thing, they are rich while the rest of us
are not. For another thing, they do not travel like you and me.
They travel in corporate jets or private jets. Jets that cost more
than your house. Jets that are nicer than your house. And this week
for the Phoenix Open, every corporate or private jet in the world
that isn't in Miami for the Super Bowl is cooling its jets at the
Scottsdale Airport. By CLAY THOMPSON. Story will move in the ``S''

SKULKING AROUND IN THE SWAMP 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Jan. 31) 
(JT) 
 By MARILYN STASIO    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whisper the words ``Key Largo'' in my ear and I am suddenly
tanned and barefoot, toes curled around the rung of a bar stool,
nodding at the tall tales of marlin fishermen and watching a fat
red sun sinking into the bay. When two guys in baggy linen suits
push through the screen door and put a round into the jukebox, the
bartender, who is a friend of mine, casually advises me to slip out
the back. A drug bust? A movie conference? I just laugh and toss
another beefsteak to the big bull alligator who lives at the far
end of the dock. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute _ this scene feels familiar. Didn't I read it
somewhere? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Let's put it this way: my brain has been soaked in so many crime
novels set in southern Florida that I have a hard time separating
life from fiction. If I'm in Miami, I expect to see Charles
Willeford's burned-out homicide detective Hoke Moseley slouching by
on his way home to El Pelicano Arms, the seedy apartment house he
manages on Singer Island. In Fort Lauderdale, there's always a
party in progress on slip F-18 in Bahia Mar, the yacht basin where
John D. MacDonald's beach-bum hero Travis McGee moors the Busted
Flush, the snazzy houseboat he won in a poker game. And if we're
down in the Keys, the private eyes and adventurer sleuths are
thicker than palm fronds on the sidewalks after a hurricane. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's just something about this place that makes criminals,
crime writers and sensation seekers out of people who would never
make a moral ripple anywhere else on the planet. Susan Orlean gets
it so right, in ``The Orchid Thief'' (Random House), when she
writes that ``the state of Florida does incite people. It gives
them big ideas ... Florida seems like the kind of place where you
can try anything.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Orlean found her real-life role model for this buccaneering
spirit in one John Laroche, a criminal entrepreneur who went into
business with the Seminoles on a horticultural enterprise that
involved poaching wild orchids from the Fakahatchee Strand, a
wilderness preserve just south of Naples. You couldn't get me into
this primordial bog _ a place teeming with cottonmouths and
diamondback rattlers and sundry other creatures that bite your
flesh and drink your blood _ if you put a gun to my head. But I,
too, am a sucker for eccentric locals like Laroche, brazen rogues
who seem to self-propagate, like certain gaudy species of poisonous
flower, in the almost indecently fertile climate of southern
Florida. Luckily for me, Carl Hiaasen, James W. Hall, Elmore
Leonard and like-minded novelists can't get enough of these
characters, either. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hiaasen's villains run to greedy land developers with visionary
schemes for turning the state into a theme park, the crooked
politicians in cahoots with these despoilers, and the freelance
scavengers who swoop down to pick over their leavings. But his
heroes _ eco-terrorists who launch crackpot crusades to stop the
rampant exploitation of the environment _ are just as bizarre. In
``Tourist Season'' one of these unhinged folk heroes thinks he can
discourage the land-grabbers by ritualistically tossing tourists to
the alligators. (A nice idea that almost works.) Another crusader,
a former governor named Skink who dropped out to live in the swamps
on a diet of road kill, periodically emerges from seclusion to
exercise his righteous rage. ``Don't you love this place!'' he
exults, during one rampage of violent retribution in ``Stormy
Weather'' (Knopf). ``Don't it bring out the beast in your soul!'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Skink may be crazy, but he's got a point. People do tend to lose
their inhibitions in Florida crime novels. Even hardened killers
aspire to new styles of decadence when they feel that hot sun at
their backs and the warm sand between their toes. Cundo Rey, a
Cuban hit man in Elmore Leonard's ``La Brava'' (Arbor House),
pursues a second career as a go-go dancer in a South Beach disco. A
serial killer who calls himself Butler Jack hijacks a cruise ship
out of Miami in James W. Hall's ``Buzz Cut'' (Delacorte) and
initiates a reign of high-seas terror as brilliant as it is
perverted. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this sultry climate and under the influence of the let-it-be
natives, your average law-abiding citizen can also run amok.
Charles Willeford captured that ineluctable impulse in
``Sideswipe'' (St. Martin's) with a retired auto worker named
Stanley Sinkiewicz. After a lifetime of painting the racing stripes
on cars, Stanley now saunters out from his Riviera Beach home each
morning with a full day's supply of cyanide pills in the
hollowed-out shaft of his wooden cane. ``Thanks to Stanley's
skill,'' we learn, ``the neighborhood was shy one boxer, one
Doberman, and one Pekingese.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the temperate climate and lackadaisical life
have had a distinctly ennobling effect on the over-the-hill
mobsters who go native in Laurence -Shames' stories. ``One visitor
in a thousand ... probably more like one in 10 thousand, was not a
tourist but a refugee,'' according to a real estate agent who spots
one of these rare birds in ``Tropical Depression.'' Sooner or
later, they all cross paths with Bert the Shirt d'Ambrosia, an aged
Mafia don who sits by the sea in his splendid shirts, stroking his
ancient chihuahua (how'd he ever escape Stanley Sinkiewicz?) and
dispensing sage advice to hot-blooded young gangsters who come
roaring down from New Jersey in fast cars. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With all the unstable characters who come to town in these
books, the local sleuths are searching for ways to maintain their
own sanity. James W. Hall's hero, a moody guy named Thorn, lives in
Thoreauvian seclusion in a stilt house on Key Largo, pondering the
decline of civilization and constructing bonefish lures as
intricate and pretty as poems. Doc Ford, the marine biologist who
lives on Sanibel Island in Randy Wayne White's novels, likes to
jump into his boat and push off for some private healing place. His
destination is usually one of the barrier islands off Florida's
west coast, those isolated outposts that exude ``their own odor,
their own feel,'' he tells us in ``The Mangrove Coast'' (Putnam), a
heady mixture of ``sea water, sulfur muck, white sand, Gulf Stream
allusions and a wind that blows salt-heavy out of the Yucatan.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once in a while somebody tries to escape before her own limbs
petrify like underwater tree roots. Alison Kerry, a young drug
runner from Key West, gets all the way to Seattle in Jenny Siler's
``Easy Money'' (Holt), but the tug of home keeps yanking her back.
The hard-boiled Allie holds no romantic illusions about the Florida
Keys. ``The outlaws' outpost,'' she calls the islands, where
``smuggling has always been a kind of family business, like farming
in the Midwest.'' But her cynicism is a fierce kind of affection,
and in the end she decides she can never untangle herself from her
roots. ``Everything in the Keys is formed by plunder,'' she says,
``even the house I grew up in, built from the timbers of a wrecked
ship, a schooner lured to the jagged reef by a phony beacon.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don't look now, but Allie just walked into the bar. She's
packing her Walther in her jeans and her '69 Mustang is idling out
front. If you're up for a bet, I'd say she's waiting for John
Laroche to show up with a pillowcase full of hot orchids.

   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A survey of recently published books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; FACE-TIME &QL; 
 &UR; Erik Tarloff (Crown, $23)
</P>
<P>
   Here's a novel that's also a primer on life in Washington, D.C.,
and it might explain a few things about the tawdry, real-life mess
that has played itself out over the past year despite a weary
public and the humiliation of one political figure after another.
Ben Krause fell in love with his girlfriend, Gretchen, while both
were working on Charles Sheffield's presidential campaign. Now,
Sheffield has been elected, Ben is his speech writer, and Gretchen
works in the White House social office. Things are going swimmingly
_ they have good jobs, good sex and good access (known as face
time) to the most powerful man in the world. Then, Ben discovers
that Gretchen is getting better face time than he is: She's having
an affair with Sheffield. When Ben confronts her, she swears she
does not want to break up but refuses to stop sleeping with the
president. It's too flattering, she says. A man in his position
could have any woman he wants. ``Yeah,'' a wounded Ben replies.
``It's too bad Golda Meir is dead. Without her around, I don't have
much chance for revenge, do I?'' Tarloff (he is married to Laura
Tyson, former head of Bill Clinton's Council of Economic Advisors)
has written a funny book about power, status and the sort of
calculated schmoozing that tosses moral standards into the Potomac.
Ben is a tad too earnest (he loves Gretchen with a tenacity that
probably wouldn't have survived the campaign, let alone the White
House), and Tarloff's writing is sometimes stiff. But his
descriptions of political life are eye-opening. One thing seems
certain: If Clinton had taken up with a pragmatic woman like
Gretchen instead of Monica Lewinsky, we'd be blissfully ignorant
today. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; RETURN TO MODESTY &QL; 
 &UR; Wendy Shalit (Free Press, $24)
</P>
<P>
   Here's an interesting argument from a 23-year-old author. Shalit
laments the fact that modesty today is associated with sexual
repression and suggests that many of the woes besetting modern
young women reflect a society that ``has lost its respect for
female modesty.'' Children know too much too soon. ``They end up,
in some fundamental way, (begin itals) not (end itals) knowing _
stunted and cut off from all they could be,'' she writes. ``If you
are not taught that you `really' want just sex, you end up seeking
much more.'' Virginity is a good thing. So is embarrassment _
rather than something to overcome, it is a valuable signal ``that
something very strange or very significant is going on, that some
boundary is being threatened either by you or by others.''
Furthermore, she says, a return to female modesty will inspire a
return to male honor. As we said, she's very young. But there is
truth in her perception of a collective yearning for bygone values
and in her premise that women are made to feel abnormal because of
it. ``We're not flocking to Jane Austen movies because we want the
facts,'' she writes, ``but because we're sick of having the facts
shoved in our faces all the time.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; THE EMPERORS OF CHOCOLATE &QL; 
 &UR; Joel Glenn Brenner (Random House, $25.95)
</P>
<P>
   When Forrest Mars' children were young, they were not allowed to
eat M&AMP;Ms. Their father was so driven to make money on the candy
that he would not spare any for his own kids. He was, as Brenner
points out, ``the Howard Hughes of candy,'' a demanding but
brilliant entrepreneur who built his family company into the
largest candy manufacturer in the world. Contrast him with Milton
Hershey, the first to make milk chocolate in America, a man who
hated financial matters and was devoted instead to the experiment
of making new products. Hershey sold his first company in midcareer
and set out to create an industrial utopia, a factory and town in
rural Pennsylvania where everything would be perfect, where almost
all of the residents would work for him and life in Hershey would
be the ultimate employee benefit. In later years, he became an
extraordinary philanthropist _ he had enough money, he said, and
saw no reason to wait to give the rest of it away. These two very
different men are at the heart of Brenner's exploration of the
candy business, a fiercely secretive, competitive, even cutthroat
industry fueled by invention and paranoia. Brenner takes us inside
the factories and boardrooms to see what has happened since others
succeeded the candy pioneers. Milton Hershey died in 1945 with only
the shirt on his back and the cash in his pocket. And Forest Mars?
According to Brenner, he came out of retirement in 1980 (at age 76)
to build another company, Ethel M. Chocolates. He lives in a
penthouse above the factory, she says, and spies on his workers
through one-way mirrors. Employees call him the ``phantom of the
candy factory.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; SLAVES IN THE FAMILY &QL; 
 &UR; Edward Ball (Ballantine, $15.95)
</P>
<P>
   ``There are five things we don't talk about in the Ball
family,'' Edward Ball's father would say. ``Religion, sex, death,
money and the Negroes.'' Ball comes from a family that owned some
of the oldest plantations in the American South, more than 20 of
them along the Cooper River in South Carolina. This book, new in
paperback, is his National Book Award-winning exploration of his
family's history as slave owners. As part of his research, he
tracked down descendants of Ball slaves, unnerving some of his
relatives. ``Within the Ball family,'' he writes, ``the plantation
stories functioned like a giant self-portrait. I was making a new
painting that might change the look of the past.'' &QL;

THROUGH DATA PORTS OF CALL ON THE WEB  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 31) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

<TEXT>
<P>
   The building boom in the cruise industry has been matched by the
proliferation of cruise-related Web sites. And while navigating the
Internet is often called surfing, the term does not quite capture
the spirit of trying to work through all the cruise-related sites
available.
</P>
<P>
   There is, after all, a lot of territory to cover _ the Yahoo
search engine found 43 categories and 2,373 sites for ``cruises.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, there is certainly some entertainment value to
seeing through the Internet just how splintered the industry has
become, with cruises to match every taste, or mix of tastes. The
Norway is sailing on Feb. 13, for example, on a Bluegrass Music
Caribbean Celebration (www.cruise-eta.com).
</P>
<P>
   And what better reason for a floating vacation than to get a
jump on New Year's Eve celebrations with a Pre-Millennium Caribbean
Cruise in March (www.cruise-eta.com/millen.html)? Or wait until
next year for what will presumably be called the Post-Millennium
Caribbean Cruise.
</P>
<P>
   If your interests tend to be more conventional, the Internet can
offer some help in guiding you through myriad choices, though the
limitations of the medium may eventually prompt a call to a trusted
travel agent or friend who has sampled life aboard a few different
ships.
</P>
<P>
   Most cruise lines have Web sites that offer details you would
typically find in a glossy brochure, and a bit more. You can often
call up a detailed map for each deck of a ship, for example.
</P>
<P>
   The sites also contain information about destinations,
itineraries and special deals. Some try to help find a trip that
suits your needs and desires. The Cunard site, www.cunardline.com,
has an online ``cruise consultant.'' Instead of the flowery
greeting-card language that is found so many cruise sites, this
electronic Cunard consultant is all business: ``I am the virtual
cruise consultant,'' it states. ``I will find all cruises which
meet your criteria.''
</P>
<P>
   Some sites offer virtual tours of their ships, but these often
require software that must be downloaded from the Internet. That
can take time, and if your computer is at all temperamental, it may
not be worth all the trouble.
</P>
<P>
   For more guidance and suggestions, try Fielding's Cruisefinder,
www.fieldingtravel.com. It offers ratings of ships _ 12 receive its
highest rating, six stars _ and summary descriptions of the
experience. From the site you can learn about their judgment of the
popular Carnival Cruise Lines: ``While they're not to our own
particular cruising taste _ we find it hard to spend more than
three or four days aboard before the color, lights and pinging slot
machines get to us _ most Carnival passengers think they've died
and gone to heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of places to find passengers' comments,
though many complaints sound as if they resulted from a mismatch of
expectations. And glowing reviews sometimes sound as if they were
submitted by loyal ship employees.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer volume on these sites can be overwhelming, but they
are worth a look, and in some cases you can seek opinions on cruise
ships from other Web browsers. Some of these sites include
www.cruiseopinion.com, www.stutt.com/rtc/home.htm, and
www.travelpage.com.
</P>
<P>
   For a more official opinion on a cruise ship, you can go to the
Web site for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, at
www.cdc.gov/nceh/programs/sanit/vsp/scores/scores.htm.
</P>
<P>
   The agency regularly conducts sanitation tests of the ships, and
makes available its database of scores. It even offers photographs
showing an inspector conducting tests aboard a ship, in case you
were curious about what sausages resting in a kitchen pan looked
like.
</P>
<P>
   After many hours with your hand on the electronic tiller of your
computer, you may decide that you want to talk to someone in person
and see some glossy brochures. The Cruise Lines International
Association (www.cruising.org) has a search service for travel
agents who specialize in cruises.

 &HT;    COLLEGE TRUSTEES MAY BE LIABLE FOR RACE POLICIES, GROUP SAYS
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Center for Individual Rights, the conservative
legal group that successfully challenged affirmative action in
Texas law school admissions, unveiled a new legal strategy Tuesday
of threatening to seek personal damages from trustees of
universities that give admission preference to minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think that trustees would be well advised to get on
this problem now and start reforming these practices now, so CIR
does not have potential clients come to us down the road,'' said
Terence Pell, senior counsel at CIR. ``Trustees need to step up to
the plate or they're going to have real problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Pell spoke at a news conference held Tuesday to publicize two
new CIR brochures, one advising students how to challenge school
admission polices and the other advising trustees of public schools
of their personal liability in racial discrimination cases. That
brochure argues that trustees of private schools are similarly
liable if their schools receive federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   Former Education Secretary William Bennett, joining Pell at the
news conference, said affirmative action programs that give
preference to minorities are ``a serious social and moral problem''
on par with the legal barriers to African Americans prior to the
1964 Civil Rights Act.
</P>
<P>
   Janelle Byrd, the lead NAACP Legal Defense Fund lawyer who faced
CIR attorneys in the Hopwood case in Texas, responded with
accusations that CIR is ``trying to create an atmosphere to
frighten trustees into dismantling legal affirmative action
programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd said she hoped that lawyers for public universities would
counsel their trustees that ``Bakke is still the law of the land,
not Hopwood.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bakke'' is the famous 1978 Supreme Court ruling that struck
down racial quotas in higher education admissions, but which also
held that colleges and universities could consider an applicant's
race as one factor in determining admission. ``Hopwood'' is the
1996 ruling by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which the
Supreme Court let stand, striking down ``diversity'' as a rationale
for considering race in college admissions.
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference, Pell charged that affirmative action
programs similar or identical to those struck down at the
University of Texas are widespread in public universities
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   And while he insisted that CIR is ``not looking for more
lawsuits'' to file _ it is set to go to trial in Ann Arbor in May
on a suit challenging the University of Michigan's affirmative
action policies _ ``if potential clients find their way to our
door, we'll consider that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to expose red-neckism wherever it is, whether it's
in Mississippi or it's in Cambridge, Massachusetts,'' Bennett
vowed.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   CIR's news conference also coincided with its placement of
full-page ads in student newspapers at 15 colleges and universities
with the headline ``Guilty by Admission,' and, in bold print,
``Nearly Every Elite College in America Violates the Law. Does
Yours?''
</P>
<P>
   The targeted schools are: the University of Chicago, Columbia,
Dartmouth, Duke, James Madison, North Carolina, Pennsylvania,
Pittsburgh, Rutgers, Stanford, Virginia, Wake Forest, George
Washington, Washington University in St. Louis and William and
Mary.
</P>
<P>
   The targeting of Virginia, James Madison and William and Mary,
along with a report to be released Wednesday by the conservative
Center for Equal Opportunity (CEO) critical of ``preferential
treatment'' of blacks in admissions to 10 Virginia institutions,
suggest Virginia may be the next legal battleground in the fight
over affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence is very strong that several Virginia schools
discriminate in favor of black applicants,'' said Linda Chavez, a
former Reagan administration official who heads CEO.
</P>
<P>
   But if Virginia is the next legal battleground, Michigan is the
next state in which affirmative action foes are planning a
political fight. Ward Connerly, the architect of successful voter
initiatives in California and Washington to outlaw affirmative
action, has said Michigan is at the top of his list of target
states for the next election.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like they've got a plan,'' said Byrd. ``And I don't
think it bodes well for those of us who believe that diversity is
in the best interest of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bennett countered, ``The law says you can't treat college
applicants differently by race in order to achieve a particular
racial mix of students. Unfortunately, many of America's leading
colleges and universities break that law every year.''

 &HT;    Global economy helps Coke profits fall
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Co. profits tumbled 27 percent in the fourth
quarter and 14 percent for 1998 as global economic troubles took
their toll.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterly profit decline was the biggest in years for the
Atlanta-based beverage company, which does 70 percent of its
business outside the United States.

   Coca-Cola warned last month about lackluster results, which were
in line with analysts' revised forecasts. Fourth quarter profit was
$597 million, or 24 cents a share, versus $817 million, or 33 cents
a share, a year earlier. Revenue dropped 5 percent to $4.46 billion
versus $4.70 a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock dropped nearly $2.50 a share in early
trading Tuesday but recovered to close at $62.62 1/2, down 31 1/4
cents.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman and Chief Executive M. Douglas Ivester, the native
Georgian promoted to the top job in late 1997, called his first
year at the helm ``a challenging period.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the economic environment became more uncertain and
volatile in the later part of 1998,'' Ivester added in a statement,
``we strongly believe our fundamental opportunities for long-term
growth have not changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say their near-term outlook remains clouded by sluggish
sales and currency devaluations in various Latin American, Asian
and European nations. Such devaluations can reduce profits when the
local currencies are translated into U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coke is so strong they can withstand a country or two, or even
five or six, having problems,'' said Martin Romm of Credit Suisse
First Boston. ``But when you have them slowing down en masse, it's
going to hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The next two quarters will continue to be challenging,'' said
Andrew Conway of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. Conway said currency
problems were the biggest drag on earnings in 1998, depriving the
company of almost $450 million in operating profit.
</P>
<P>
   Conway added currency woes go hand in hand with slow sales, as
reflected in Coca-Cola's numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide case volume declined 1 percent in the fourth quarter
-- in part because of fewer shipping days . For all of 1998, case
volume rose 6 percent. That figure fell short of a 7 percent goal
and was bouyed by big gains early in the year.
</P>
<P>
   Annual profit fell to $3.53 billion, or $1.42 a share, versus
$4.13 billion, or $1.64 a share in 1997. Revenue was flat at $18.81
billion versus $18.87 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Conway predicted no major strategy shifts but added Coca-Cola
``may be more resourceful in its marketing spending.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Conway and Romm said the profit downdraft shouldn't reflect
on Ivester's early tenure as successor to the late Roberto
Goizueta.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has faced a tough international situation, and under the
circumstances I think he's done an outstanding job,'' Romm said.
``I see no sign the company has lost its resolve or long-term
focus,'' he added, citing continuing acquisitions and investments.

 &HT;    MCI makes accounts accessible on Net
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's a kind of self-service for telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   MCI WorldCom this week trotted out a new feature aimed at
letting business customers use the Internet to tinker with their
accounts, making changes on the fly without talking to any company
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Known as MCIWC Interact, the innovation and its marketing come
out of the company's large Atlanta operations, according to
spokeswoman Colleen Cotter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we made a long-term strategic commitment to move
many of our key business processes and customer applications to the
Web,'' Cotter said. ``Our customers have been clamoring for this.''
</P>
<P>
   Interact lets a customer change network configurations and
allocate bandwidth as needed, she said. The customer may also order
new products and services, including pagers, phone lines, and
calling cards.
</P>
<P>
   MCI WorldCom, which unveiled the service at a Washington, D.C.,
trade show, charges nothing extra for the service, Cotter said.
</P>
<P>
   It will save money for both the company and its customers, she
said. ``It streamlines the entire process of how telecom invoices
are reviewed, analyzed and paid.''
</P>
<P>
   MCI WorldCom's business markets unit, which was all MCI before
the recent merger with WorldCom, is based in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The company has about 4,000 employees in metro Atlanta.

 &HT;    Turner, other large companies fine-tune intranetsBy Charles
Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Turner Broadcasting executives are wielding the
Internet as a scalpel, shaving business expenses while cutting new
paths to reach its 10,000 employees in Atlanta and worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   They do so through creating an expanded intranet, an online
interactive repository of information and services about their
company. The Atlanta-based company's employee directory, for
example, is now published online rather than printed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're saving $10,000 a year through our intranet,'' says
Ronnie Gunnerson, the company's vice president of corporate
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Turner Broadcasting, of course, is not alone. Nearly every big
company in town has an intranet page, including such giants as
BellSouth Corp. and First Union bank.
</P>
<P>
   But Turner Broadcasting's intranet was one of the first, and the
company is still considered a local leader in this new and growing
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of companies have tried to catch up but Turner is still
ahead of the pack,'' says Tillman Douglas, manager of sales at
ThinkAtlanta. It designs and maintains all kinds of Web sites for
companies throughout the Southeast. ThinkAltanta, for example, was
hired to redesign Turner's intranet.
</P>
<P>
   Intranets are Web sites created for internal use by a company,
school or church. Typically, only members of those organizations
can access an intranet.
</P>
<P>
   What appeals to companies about the intranet is that it can be a
low-cost way to publish and continually update corporate material
such as policy manuals, benefit plans and companywide memos or
announcements.
</P>
<P>
   Publishing online saves companies tens of thousands of dollars
in printing and updating costs annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intranet is a way that companies can make money by saving
money,'' says Scott Shamp, director of the University of Georgia's
Dowden Center New Media studies. He has also served as a consultant
on Turner's intranet efforts.
</P>
<P>
   But saving money is just the beginning, adds Shamp. He sees
intranets as a way to open two-communication among a company's top
executives and the rank and file.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next step is using the intranet to let employees tell the
company what they want,'' says Shamp.
</P>
<P>
   Turner Broadcasting shares Shamp's vision for its intranet.
``The intranet opens the company up more to employees and that's a
key part of our strategy,'' says Gunnerson.
</P>
<P>
   She and her intranet manager, Molly Chase, envision the day when
the company's top executives can discuss breaking developments
about Turner Broadcasting live with employees through the intranet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could do an internal `talk back live' about, say, the
impact of Digital TV on the company's programming,'' says Chase,
referring to a CNN show.
</P>
<P>
   That day is not here yet, but the company's intranet is proving
increasingly popular among employees. The number of annual hits, a
common, if imperfect, measure of use, has grown tenfold in the past
two years to 4.2 million. That represents an average of 3,500
employee visits daily to the intranet or 25,000 a week.
</P>
<P>
   Chase says company research shows that employees have found a
wide variety of uses for the intranet. ``People are using it (for
everything from) finding in-house recommendations for a plumber to
signing up for volunteer work,'' says Chase.
</P>
<P>
   Gunnerson and Chase didn't create the company's intranet. They
inherited a strong effort already in progress, begun several years
ago by the human resources department.
</P>
<P>
   But Gunnerson has greatly expanded on the original work, adding
new services and a uniformity to the look and use of all pages.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best new features Gunnerson has added is an
electronic clipping service. Turner Broadcasting, like many media
giants, closely monitors press coverage of its many cable TV
channels.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, that work was done with scissors, paste and
photocopying. ``The PR department prepared 200 sets of clips daily
for key executives,'' says Gunnerson.
</P>
<P>
   Now that work is done online, its results open to every employee
of the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only has that helped open up the company to everyone, but
it's saved us a fortune in paper and man hours,'' says Gunnerson.
To her, that's what the intranet is all about.

 &HT;    Barnes outlines Y2K efforts
 &HT;    By Rob Chambers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gov. Roy Barnes will unveil the outlines of a
broad-based Y2K program for state and local government, for
businesses and the public this Friday at the Georgia Year 2000
Utilities Forum. ``The governor sees this as an opportunity to
inform the public about the level of effort and strategy the state
will use to responsibly manage the Y2K problem,'' said spokesman
Jim Flowers.
</P>
<P>
   The forum will be held at at the Georgia International
Convention Center in College Park from 8 a.m. until 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Some 700 people have signed up for the event which also features
information on Y2K readiness and updates from representatives of
major utilities doing business in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone can attend. Reservations can be made on the Web at
(http://www.bytewise
</P>
<P>
   .com/atlyear2000) or by calling 770-641-2223.
</P>
<P>
   What to do when bug bites
</P>
<P>
   Much has been written on how to prepare for Y2K, but little has
appeared on what to do when the computer bug bites.
</P>
<P>
   That gap has been partially filled by consultant Ian S. Hayes
who spoke at the Hyatt Regency Atlanta last week.
</P>
<P>
   For businesses, the key is a crisis management organization, ``a
command and control structure that supports a company through the
transition period by capturing, directing and tracking responses to
all problems,'' Hayes explained.
</P>
<P>
   A fully staffed crisis management team, according to Hayes, is
divided into four areas. These include a crisis response team in
overall charge of the Y2K effort and a crisis help desk ``that is
the focal point for receiving and tracking all incoming issues.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are emergency teams, each with an area of expertise,
that actually performs the damage control.
</P>
<P>
   Not least, the fourth area is a legal support team that tracks
compliance and flags legal problems _ potential legal liability is
the great Y2K wild card.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes and co-author William M. Ulrich, another expert in the Y2K
arena, have collected their thoughts in a paper, ``Six Steps to
Crisis Management.'' CD-ROM copies of this work are being
distributed free. For the steps to obtain your own go to

 &HT;    Johnson makes commitment to UGA
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Georgia got a much-needed commitment from a wide
receiver, but it wasn't from the one most Bulldog fans were hoping
for.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Johnson, a 6-foot-4, 215-pound receiver from Union High
School in Tulsa, Okla., committed to the Bulldogs at a news
conference Tuesday. Johnson chose Georgia over Miami, Tennessee,
Missouri, Texas Christian and Tulsa.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, wide receiver Reggie Brown of Carrollton, the No. 1
receiver prospect in the South, did not show up for his scheduled
official visit in Athens. When reached by telephone on Tuesday,
Brown's mother said her son was not available to take calls.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia is losing its top two receivers from the 1998 season,
Champ Bailey to the NFL and Tony Small to graduation. The Bulldogs
also are pursuing wide receiver Durrell Robinson of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson gives the Bulldogs 22 verbal commitments. National
signing day is Feb. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia gets a player who could play several positions in
additon to wide receiver. Johnson caught 54 passes in the fall for
916 yards and 13 touchdowns. But he also started at free safety
and, because of his body type, could beef up and play tight end or
linebacker, if needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a big kid that can play,'' said Union High coach
Bill Blakenship, whose team finished 13-1 as state runner-up in
Oklahoma's highest classification. ``His heart is at receiver, but,
as a recruiter, it's a no-brainer that this kid could play wherever
you needed him.''

 &HT;    Researchers grapple with questions of life beyond Earth
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ For the first time in history, humans now have
the capability to move life beyond Earth, and researchers in
physics, chemistry and genetics are pooling their knowledge to
understand where terrestial life may end up and how it may change
and adapt.
</P>
<P>
   ''Humanity is entering a new evolutionary territory _ space _ in
a manner analogous to the first sea creature crawling onto the
land,'' said Emily Morey-Holton, a researcher with the NASA's Ames
Research Center in California. ''So, we want to look at how life
may evolve in space.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, she said that legs are of little use _ and may
even be a hindrance _ in the zero_gravity of outer space. ''There's
an old biological hypothesis that says 'use it or lose it,' so
could humans in space one day evolve to lose their legs?''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are also trying to determine if certain plants and
animals, which could be used to provide food and other human needs,
may be better suited than others to accompany humans on longterm
space voyages.
</P>
<P>
   Such questions are being explored in a new discipline of science
called astrobiology. Researchers are interested not only in human
evolution in space, but also how physical factors such as gravity
and radiation influence our evolution on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Several researchers in the new field outlined some of their
goals here at the annual meeting of the American Association for
the Advancement of Science this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''Astrobiology will be a broad field that will study life in the
universe,'' said David Morrison of the Ames Research Center.
''Astrobiology challenges us to understand he origin of life on
Earth and elswhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers in the field will be seeking answers to several
fundamental questions:
</P>
<P>
   _ How did life begin?
</P>
<P>
   _ Are there other Earth_like planets that may be habitable?
</P>
<P>
   _ Is there life on other planets, and how can we recognize its
presence?
</P>
<P>
   _ What kinds of crops, plants and animals will be best suited to
go to Mars and other planets and moons that humans may colonize.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the early work of the astrobiologists is focusing on
Mars and Europa, a big moon of Jupiter. Scientists will try to
determine the prospects for establishing stable ecosystems on Mars
to support long_term human presence on that planet. They also will
focus on where future space missions to Mars and Europa should
concentrate a serch for life on those celestial bodies.

 THE GOP DISCOVERS THE LADIES   (For use by New York Times News
Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's impeachment trial in the Senate
is so rich in irony, hypocrisy and vacuousness that after it is
over months will be needed to reflect on the folly of it all.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most immediately apparent and amazing developments,
however, is the sudden urgency the Republican House prosecutors see
in protecting civil rights, equal rights for women and the sexual
harassment laws. Over and over they stressed their deep fears that
if President Clinton is not removed from office, the lack of
punishment for his sexual irresponsibility will destroy all respect
for the rights of minorities and women.
</P>
<P>
   This is truly a remarkable advancement. Until now, House
Republicans have had a history of opposing and trying to weaken
laws meant to enforce those very concepts.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tim Johnson, D-S.D, observed wryly that there was ``a bit
of eye rolling'' among Democrats as the GOP team piously wrapped
itself and its party in an unfamiliar mantle of concern for
minority and gender rights.
</P>
<P>
   The political gender gap, reflecting the fact that women back
Democratic candidates in a greater proportion than they support GOP
candidates, opened a decade ago because women perceived the
Democrats to be more friendly toward their rights and interests
than the GOP. That party has taken up the cudgels against
affirmative action, family medical leave, minimum wage increases,
expanded funding and powers for the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission, sex education in the schools, family planning
subsidies, tougher sexual harassment measures and abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1991, when Clarence Thomas was confirmed as a Supreme
Court justice by mostly Republican votes despite Anita Hill's
charges of sexual harassment, public awareness of the issue has
risen dramatically. Congress and the courts constantly grapple with
definitions of just which actions constitute sexual harassment,
with somewhat mixed results.
</P>
<P>
   It was disingenuous of the Republican prosecutors to try to
transform the president's sins into a women's rights case. The
impeachment articles do not ask for a vote on whether he sexually
harassed anybody but instead accuse him of perjury and obstruction
of justice, totally separate offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the charges are the allegations that the president
lied about his consentual sexual adventures with Monica Lewinsky.
But she initiated and encouraged their relationship and was
rewarded with gifts and the president's backing in her efforts to
find a good job in New York. Portraying her as an abused victim of
his power is silly.
</P>
<P>
   The sexual harassment issue arises only in the lawsuit filed by
Paula Jones, in which she charged that he humiliated her by
exposing himself to her in a Little Rock hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   That suit was thrown out of court by U.S. District Judge Susan
Webber Wright, who ruled that the alleged single instance of
exposing himself _ even if true _ was an insufficiently severe and
pervasive act to create a hostile environment and a cause of
action. Following the supposed incident, Jones received regular pay
raises.
</P>
<P>
   After she appealed the decision, the president settled the suit
for $850,000 without apologizing or admitting anything, a fact the
House prosecutors suggested demonstrated his guilt rather than a
desire to end the litigation hassle. They offered no evidence to
support their sinister supposition.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee originally proposed four articles
of impeachment, one of which accused the president of lying under
oath in the Jones civil case. A narrow majority of the House
rejected that article as legally unsubstantiated and inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jones case loomed large in the prosecutors' oratory in
the Senate anyway. It was their way of trying to undermine the
president's support, particularly among women who feel that backing
his overall female-friendly policies is more in their interest than
rejecting him over the issue of sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   And it was inherently dishonest. Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif.,
claimed that if the president is not dumped, it will ``send a
message ... that you might as well just keep quiet about it
(improper sexual advances) because the person can lie in court and
suffer no recrimination.'' The notion that the president has not
suffered during all this is cruel and outlandish.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, the House Judiciary Committee chairman and
leading prosecutor, bemoaned ``the damage to sexual harassment
laws'' and said that ``those are serious consequences.'' His
anguish on behalf of female victims would be more effective were he
not a leading champion of criminalizing an abortion of a fertilized
egg that could to save the life of a pregnant woman or prevent a
birth resulting from forcible rape.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy White House Counsel Cheryl Mills took on the GOP
prosecutors for dragging imaginary threats to civil rights and
female equality into the debate. She pointed out that Jones had her
day in court and that the president's overall civil rights record
is ``unimpeachable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The house of civil rights is strong because its foundation is
strong,'' she declared. ``It was never at the core of the Jones
case.'' Well said, indeed.

   ST. LOUIS _ With its colorful geometric patterns, soaring
skylights and blooming gardens, Gateway Elementary, Middle and
Michael School is an oasis in a neighborhood of dilapidated homes
and crumbling factories.
</P>
<P>
   The 4-year-old public magnet school for science and technology
has won raves from parents and national leaders for delivering a
fun, quality education to even the most stubborn learners.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, classrooms are filled with a variety of animals,
hallways feature museum-quality science displays and even preschool
children are taught to work on computers.
</P>
<P>
   As politicians debate federal support for school construction
and renovation,
</P>
<P>
   Missouri is just one of several states creating a new generation
of improved learning environments for students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are what most schools want to be,'' Gateway Elementary
Principal Richard Sirna said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Education agrees. It cited Gateway in
1998 as a model school for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most noticeable differences between this school and
antiquated ones is the design of individual classrooms and overall
layout of buildings. It's actually three schools in one.
</P>
<P>
   As teaching styles evolve and technology plays an increasing
role in instruction, teachers need larger classrooms to better
accommodate computers and cooperative learning, said Richard
Passantino, the recent past chair of the American Institute of
Architects' Committee on Architecture for Education.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of cramming a room with rows of desks, Gateway
classrooms have open areas that allow students to gather in groups
or use the floor to work on projects.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say such open classrooms are better for students
because they encourage children to work together and allow teachers
to move more freely among students to assist them with their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gone from the sage on the stage to a guide on the side,''
Passantino said. ``Before, the instructor stood at the front of the
classroom and imparted wisdom onto students. Now, the instruction
is much more modified to do student research, work in groups and in
pairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Gateway has received national recognition for using all of its
available space for learning. The hallways and outdoor play areas
are filled with science stations where students can conduct
experiments. The school library has an exposed ceiling with colored
pipes to teach children which ducts carry air, water and heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's really good because they have more stuff to help
you learn,'' said 9-year-old Sarah Schofield. The hallway science
displays are ``neat, because anytime you want you can read them,''
she added.
</P>
<P>
   Enrollment steadily increases
</P>
<P>
   Overall school layout also has changed in modern schools, as
school crowding becomes a critical problem. During the next five
years, enrollment at public elementary and secondary schools is
expected to grow by 1.3 million, according to the U.S. Department
of Education.
</P>
<P>
   When planning new schools, architects and educators often must
decide how to accommodate the most students without compromising
instructional quality.
</P>
<P>
   To tackle this problem, many new schools use the ``house''
concept to create a sense of smallness among a large student body.
The school is subdivided into groups, or houses, each with its own
student body, faculty and administrator.
</P>
<P>
   At Gateway, the elementary and middle schools are combined into
one 19-acre complex. The campus also includes the Michael School
for orthopedically disabled children. While each school is
autonomous and has its own principal, they all share a common
cafeteria, library and science courtyard.
</P>
<P>
   For security reasons, schools also have moved away from designs
that create niches, nooks and crannies where students can find
hiding places for graffiti and mischief.
</P>
<P>
   Although school crime has slightly decreased in recent years,
students are more fearful than before and believe gang activity has
increased, according to a report released in October by the federal
justice and education departments.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway's youngest children play in a schoolyard surrounded by
classrooms, keeping them sheltered from the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   In some schools, administrative offices' walls are made of glass
so adults can supervise children walking through the hallway at all
times. At Gateway, most classroom doors are see-through.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   School as a community center
</P>
<P>
   The modern amenities come at a high cost. Taxpayers spent $25
million on Gateway's three schools. Still, that amount was less
than the national average cost to build three separate schools.
</P>
<P>
   The average new elementary school costs $6 million, and middle
and high schools cost about $15 million each, according to the U.S.
General Accounting Office (GAO), the auditing arm of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government needs to have some involvement because
voters aren't going to keep voting to raise their taxes,''
principal Sirna said.
</P>
<P>
   To gain support from taxpayers, many districts have built
schools that can be used for community programs after hours, said
Janet Stork, an educational design consultant for Project Zero, a
research institute affiliated with the Harvard University Graduate
School of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers often are more willing to pay for a school if its
theater is large enough to accommodate a community production or if
the classrooms have enough computers and other equipment to support
adult education programs at night, Stork said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our country, we need those places because lots of people
are disenfranchised,'' Stork said. ``Sometimes people don't see why
they should invest in schools because it doesn't impact them
directly. By making schools more like a community center, maybe it
gets kids feeling like the community cares about them and the
community feels like people are getting involved.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Stanley M. Makowski Early Childhood Center in
Buffalo, N.Y., includes a community day care center, and the
nurse's office is a public clinic staffed with a nurse practitioner
licensed to prescribe medication.
</P>
<P>
   Details and planning are key
</P>
<P>
   School districts often underestimate the importance of aesthetic
details when building a new school, Passantino said.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway planners used natural wood, windows and skylights to
help make the school appeal to children.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to avoiding drab colors, some schools have replaced
fluorescent lights with softer incandescent lights or larger
windows. Studies have shown that students learn better when exposed
to natural and incandescent light. A 1996 GAO report on the
condition of America's schools showed that most states report
lighting as a key problem in schools.
</P>
<P>
   But Stork warned that in their hurry to build schools quickly
and save as much money as possible, school officials need to be
especially mindful of planning.
</P>
<P>
   When planning a school, architects and educators should do a
better job of communicating with each other, Stork said. The best
schools are the result of architects listening to teachers about
their needs and teachers being open-minded about a school's budget
limitations, Stork said.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers praise a well-designed school, but acknowledge that
learning requires more than a fancy building.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best resources are the administrative resources because
they are supportive of the teachers when we try something new,''
Gateway first-grade teacher Janet Kyger said. ``It's the first time
in this district that I feel like I'm treated like a professional,
and that really makes me want to come to school and do a better
job.''

 &HT;    NEW BATTLE OVER SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION FUNDS EXPECTED IN CONGRESS
 &HT;    580&AMP;add. For release Sunday, Jan. 31. With SCHOOL-DESIGN and
SCHOOL-GRAPHIC.
 &HT;    BY NICHOLE MONROE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a move expected to spark a new partisan battle
in Congress, President Clinton wants the federal government to
authorize $22 billion in bonds to build new schools and repair old
ones, issuing tax credits to those who buy them.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Treasury department estimates the tax credits will cost
the government $3.7 billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is more ambitious than the $19.4 billion bill
backed last year by Clinton, which never made it out of a House
committee and was killed in the Senate by a 56-42 vote.
</P>
<P>
   But with many Republicans eager to get back to policy at a time
when impeachment proceedings have dragged down their poll ratings,
``We think there is a fair amount of support in the Congress,
enough to create enough pressure to get it passed,'' White House
spokesman Barry Toiv said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The studies that have been done show that classrooms need
renovation or that schools need to be replaced entirely,'' Toiv
said. ``The president believes the federal government has a
responsibility to help.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate on school construction also is being fueled by a 1996
federal report that showed 60 percent of American schools need
significant repairs. The report estimated that schools need $112
billion more for renovations and to comply with federal
requirements such as access for the disabled and cleanup of
environmental hazards.
</P>
<P>
   Under Clinton's proposal, the government would offer tax credits
to companies or individuals who buy school construction bonds from
school districts or states. Bond buyers could claim the credit when
they annually file their tax return, instead of receiving interest
payments from the schools.
</P>
<P>
   With the government offering a tax incentive to cover the
interest payments, school districts would have more money to spend
on actual renovation costs, proponents say.
</P>
<P>
   About $11 billion would be used by 125 school districts with the
largest proportion of poor children, said Julie Green, spokeswoman
for the U.S. Department of Education. These districts include
Atlanta city schools; Dayton (Ohio) County schools; Broward, Dade
and Palm Beach counties in Florida; Austin Independent School
District in Texas; and cities in North Carolina and Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The government would provide another $11 billion to states, with
an emphasis on those with a disproportionate number of poor
children.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for the federal money, states, territories and school
districts would have to submit a study of their construction and
renovation needs, list safeguards to ensure the money is spent
properly, and describe how the money would be divided fairly,
especially between rural and high-growth areas.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say improving schools is among their top priorities,
which also include revamping Social Security, cutting income taxes
and fortifying national defense, said Pete Jeffries, communications
director for House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than back Clinton's plan, Republicans are likely to
devise their own, said Trent Duffy, spokesman for the House Ways
and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Duffy criticized Clinton's proposal as temporary because it
provides money only for 2000 and 2001. Because the proposal targets
the poorest districts, it may unfairly exclude other districts that
may also need help, Duffy added.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, House Republicans approved a bill that would have
provided $2.7 billion to school districts every five years. Under
that proposal, the money would have been slated to build or
renovate schools, but also could have been used for other needs,
Duffy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans supported this with overwhelming margins in the
past, so I think that's an indication that Republicans will support
such a bill,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   School construction proposals are also likely in the Senate,
where Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., has introduced a measure
similar to one he co-sponsored last year. That bill is being
considered by the Labor and Human Resources committee.
</P>
<P>
   Past congressional efforts to aid school construction have been
limited.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Congress passed the Education Infrastructure Act, which
allocated $100 million for school officials to repair, renovate,
alter or construct schools. However, the program was eliminated in
1995 by legislative efforts to balance the budget, and none of the
$100 million made it to schools, Green said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Congress passed a bill providing $2.4 billion in tax
credits to certain school-business partnerships to pay for a
variety of expenses, including building renovation.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Anderson, superintendent of the Dublin city schools in
Ohio, said politicians should do whatever is necessary to reach a
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care whether (the money) comes from federal, state or
local,'' Anderson said. ``At least give us the money to provide our
kids with as much possibility for success. Anything short of that,
in my opinion, is another excuse to do nothing.''

   MIAMI _ Cornelius Bennett addressed the Falcons on Monday. His
topic: How not to lose the Super Bowl. On this subject, Bennett is
an unchallenged expert.
</P>
<P>
   This is Bennett's fifth Super Bowl. He hasn't won one yet. Only
one player has been been part of five losing Super Bowl teams, and
that one _ Buffalo and San Diego backup quarterback Gale Gilbert _
should carry an asterisk. Bennett is the real deal, four times a
loser with Buffalo. ``I hoping the fifth time is the charm,'' he
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, he lent his new team the benefit of his old
club's experience. Put simply, it was this:
</P>
<P>
   Get some sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking back, I wish (the Bills) hadn't hung out the way we
did,'' Bennett said. ``I'm not going to attribute losing to that.
But when guys ask me, `What's it like?' and `What's going to make
the difference?', I've got to tell them something different.
Because what we did didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Bennett described the Bills as ``the party team of
the 1990s.'' Realizing that it raised the ire of long-suffering
Buffalo fans, he backed off a bit. ``We did care about the game.
... We didn't do it intentionally to go out and lose. ... But
that's just what I'd have to do different, and I can't just say I
was out there by myself (as a socializing Bill). Of course, had we
won, I'd be saying, 'Hang out 'til 5 in the morning.'''
</P>
<P>
   Since leaving the Bills for Atlanta in 1996, Bennett has
undergone all manner of growth. He has become a Christian. He
served 36 days in jail last summer after pleading guilty to sexual
misconduct. After being prodded by Dan Reeves to play like the
All-Pro linebacker he was in his Buffalo days, he has become a
vital force in what is being called the best front seven in
football. And this carouser of renown has dubbed himself the
Falcons' voice of reason.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills ``hung out a little less each year,'' Bennett said.
``But Buffalo's a small town, and we had a lot of single guys. You
remember how it was when you were 21. It's hard to tell a young guy
to stay in and chill. I'm just trying to tell our guys, 'Don't get
caught up in the hype.' ``
</P>
<P>
   This is not to confuse moderation with monasticism. South Beach
is but a 15-minute limo ride from Falcons HQ, and Bennett himself
has made the trek twice. ``I'm not saying just to stay in the
room,'' he said. ``But there's a difference between staying out
past 1 or 2 in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bills' first Super Bowl loss, by one point to the Giants,
was honorable enough. The three thereafter seem, at least in
retrospect, the work of an easily distracted team. Thurman Thomas
missed the first two plays of Super Bowl XXVI because he couldn't
find his helmet. The Bills led Dallas at halftime of Super XXVIII
but crumbled via turnovers. ``I tried to tell (the Falcons) how not
to get caught up in the moment,'' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   Has he seen any evidence that his new temmates, most of them
Super novices, have taken his counsel? ``We have (midnight) curfew
starting tonight,'' Bennett said. ``With Buffalo, we didn't have a
lot of that. I'm hoping they take heed. If this works, I'll be a
genius.''

 &HT;    Spotlight shines on QB Chandler
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Walk down Chris Chandler's perilous career path, and
you'd get pretty good at the ol' duck-and-cover, too. But here is
today's amazing Super Bowl twist. Now, he's defending himself
against charges that he is the better of the quarterbacks left
standing.
</P>
<P>
   He must appear before the pearls of sports journalism and
declare: C'mon, I'm not all that. Give this Elway fellow some
credit.
</P>
<P>
   I've considered the heretical notion that the Falcons have the
advantage at quarterback here at Armageddon XXXIII. A fellow wretch
from Miami wrote as much Tuesday morning. Chandler believes none of
this wisdom pertinent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doesn't do anything for me,'' he said. ``I think it's an
absurd thing to say that anybody is going to play better than John
Elway. I've been playing really good football for the last two
years. (But) most people really don't know this game well. For the
general person to say I'm playing better than John Elway, I think
that's stretching it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler's got the numbers over Elway this season. The passing
yardage is greater, the touchdowns more, the rating higher. More
significantly, the Falcons found themselves a quarterback with the
Elwayian ability to construct victory from the chaos of a game's
final moments. A couple of drives 10 days ago in Minneapolis, and
suddenly the quarterback nobody wanted is being bronzed.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever ``it'' is that marks the accomplished two-minute
quarterbacks, Chandler is in the process of acquiring it. After
what happened against Vikings in the NFC Championship, your teeth
could rot from all the sweetness thrown Chandler's way.
</P>
<P>
   ``This organization has put five stars on my shoulder and made
me the general,'' Chandler said. And the fellow foot soldiers seem
well pleased.
</P>
<P>
   They will speak in terms usually reserved for the established
winners of the position. ``Guys like that, they have competitive
spirits,'' receiver Terance Mathis said. ``And then you've got some
guys who just go through the motions and say, `All right, let's
just get this game over with.' Chris is a guy who wants to win.
He's going to do almost everything right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He exhibits the patience of Joe Montana,'' Eugene Robinson
said. ``Guys would be in his face and he'd go, `Excuse me, I've got
to complete this pass.' That's the same thing Chris does. You've
got to be a cool dude in the pocket, and he's just cool.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He understands the position. His mechanics. His footwork. His
vision. He has conveyed more to me than any quarterback I've been
associated with,'' said Steve DeBerg, who has been associated with
nearly all of them.
</P>
<P>
   From kicking around on six teams in 10 seasons to becoming the
anchor of a Super Bowl team, an amazing transformation completes
itself Sunday. At the time of his defining performance in
Minnesota, Chandler had no time to appreciate what was happening.
Now, though, ``I look back and feel a little more satisfaction than
maybe someone else would. Being given up on so much, having so many
teams say I couldn't do it for them . . . '' So amazing that when
some say he is no John Elway, it almost comes out like a
compliment.

HEAD OF BRITAIN'S MIRROR GROUP RESIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ After a remarkably public showdown with board members
and stockholders, David Montgomery resigned Tuesday as chief
executive of Mirror Group PLC, opening the way for a takeover
battle for one of Britain's oldest tabloid newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery, 50, is one of the most contentious figures in the
British newspaper industry. He was initially lauded by investors
for rescuing Mirror Group after the depredations of its former
owner, Robert Maxwell; then he was reviled by many journalists who
lost their jobs to his cost-cutting, and was ultimately forced out
by people who depicted him as a hindrance to shareholders'
fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   His resignation came after he failed to persuade institutional
investors holding 31 percent of Mirror stock to back him in a
bitter, personal feud with Sir Victor Blank, the former investment
banker who is the company's nonexecutive chairman. Sir Victor had
threatened to call a no-confidence vote at a board meeting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The boardroom battle was propelled by takeover approaches from
two regional newspaper groups that have pushed Mirror stock to 207
pence, or $3.41, from a low of 136 pence in October.
</P>
<P>
   The two suitors are Trinity PLC, Britain's biggest regional
newspaper group, which made an all-stock offer valuing Mirror
shares at 160 pence, or $2.65, and Regional Independent Media,
owned by Candover Investment Trust, which is backed by the
financier George Soros and a Deutsche Bank unit. Last week, the
Mirror board rejected Candover's offer of 200 pence, which would
have valued the company at 913 million pounds, or $1.51 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Neither suitor gave a clear indication Tuesday of its intentions
after the news of Montgomery's departure. Both Sir Victor, the
chairman, and investors such as Phillips &AMP; Drew, with a 21 percent
stake in Mirror Group, had held Montgomery responsible for blocking
takeover moves, accusing him of putting his own position in the
company ahead of shareholders' interests.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the daily tabloid The Mirror, the company publishes
The Sunday Mirror and several Scottish and regional newspapers. It
also owns a cable television channel, Live TV.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery, a former newspaper editor, was brought into the
Mirror Group in 1992 after Maxwell, the entrepreneur whose
plundering of the group's pension fund had left the company in
disarray, drowned at sea in 1991.

 &HT;    NATURAL FAMILY PLANNING
 &HT;    PHOTOS AVAILABLE

</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By Anntoinette Moore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGVIEW _ When Deya Stavinoha's husband first suggested they
use natural family planning as birth control, she was very
skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   It was soon after Stavinoha, who is Presbyterian, had married
her husband, Jerome, who is Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   He finally persuaded her to attend a natural family planning
class.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to argue with the teachers. I was going to give
them a hard time,'' Stavinoha said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she was converted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they started explaining how your body's signs tell you
when you're fertile, it made sense,'' Stavinoha said.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband now teach classes in natural family planning
under the auspices of the Couple-to-Couple League in Gregg County
Texas. They have three children, all of whom were planned, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   They teach a method developed by the Couple-to-Couple League, an
interdenominational nonprofit organization based in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``Natural family planning is the awareness of a woman's
fertility cycle. You can manage your fertility easily by being
aware of these changing signs and symptoms,'' Stavinoha said,
adding that the signs are not hard to detect.
</P>
<P>
   By using natural family planning, a couple can time their sexual
intercourse to either increase the woman's chances of becoming
pregnant or to avoid pregnancy, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The couples at these classes learn to detect (the woman's)
cervical mucous flow, which is one of the signs of the fertile
phase, and they monitor her daily basal temperature,'' Stavinoha
said.
</P>
<P>
   This ``sympto-thermal method'' _ charting a woman's basal body
temperature and her Z through her monthly menstrual cycle _ is very
effective, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The women who use this method actually take better care of
themselves. It's like looking at yourself in the mirror every
day,'' Stavinoha said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This method can be adapted and used easily with irregular
menstrual periods because the rules still apply. Every woman is
different. Every woman has a different cycle,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It is a far cry from the rhythm method of birth control,
Stavinoha said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the rhythm method, you had to be like a little clock. It
didn't work for women who had irregular cycles,'' Stavinoha said.
``Rhythm is like the Model T of natural family planning.''
</P>
<P>
   Father Mark Kusmirek, of Christ the King Catholic Church in
Kilgore, Texas, said natural family planning is approved by the
Catholic church.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church asks that in everything we do, we cooperate with
God's plan for nature. The church calls that the natural law,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   While birth control pills or IUDs circumvent nature, natural
family planning enables individuals to cooperate with nature,
Kusmirek said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really calls for a husband and wife to understand each
other's bodies and the cycle of fertility. Couples choose to have
intercourse during times when they know they have a good chance to
conceive or not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The couples that I know who have used natural family planning,
it helps them know each other better,'' Kusmirek said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It opens up couples to understanding . . . that love is more
than just having intercourse, it's the whole gamut of things that
bring people together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stavinoha said natural family planning ``is not a Catholic
thing, just like breast-feeding is not a Catholic thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Conservative Jews and many Protestant churches don't condone
artificial forms of birth control,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Couples in the class ``are from all denominations. They come for
many different reasons. Many women cannot take birth-control
pills,'' Stavinoha said. ``Many women believe that it's wrong to
pollute a woman's body with drugs that are not necessary, with
drugs that have dangerous side effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you use contraception . . . it is an anti-procreative
act, whereas abstinence (from sex) during the fertile times is not
an anti-procreative act. It's just abstaining.''
</P>
<P>
   Couples who abstain from sex while the woman is fertile are not
doing anything to destroy the potential consequences of that sex _
a fertilized egg or fetus, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fertility is not a disease. Fertility is a gift from God. It
is not a pathological condition or disease that you have to treat
or cure. It is not a burden. It is a blessing,'' Stavinoha said.
</P>
<P>
   Women's health-care nurse practitioner Linda Boggs said
effective natural family planning depends on accurate tracking of a
woman's fertile periods.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to keep an actual chart of their periods for about
six months before they know what that fertile period is,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have many people who ask me about it. Usually they're
pretty attuned to their bodies even before they ask,'' said Boggs,
who works at Women's Health Care Clinic, a satellite of Diagnostic
Clinic of Longview, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always tell them that this is a way that you can not get
pregnant if you don't want to be. But most people are more
interested in other methods of contraception, like birth-control
pills,'' or contraceptive injections, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many women use natural family planning while they're
breast-feeding, said Boggs, who has been a nurse for 20 years and
learned about the method during her medical training.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no side-effects to their baby that they're
breast-feeding at
</P>
<P>
   all,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage is the method's low cost, basically limited to
the cost of a basal thermometer, charts and perhaps a natural
family planning class, Boggs said.
</P>
<P>
   For a typical woman using natural family planning, the method is
80 percent effective in preventing contraception during the first
year, she said. For the ``perfect user,'' it is 91 to 99 percent
effective, Boggs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not bad. But it has to be somebody who's willing to put
that much effort into it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One disadvantage is that it offers no protection against
sexually transmitted diseases or HIV, Boggs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another disadvantage is that the woman will have to abstain
from sex when her libido is highest,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Natural family planning is a real good method for the right
individual. Like any method of birth control, it's not for
everybody. With the right counseling and the right individual it
could be an effective method,'' Boggs said.
</P>
<P>
   Stavinoha said remembering to take your temperature before you
get up every day, monitoring your cervical mucous flow and charting
the changes was not difficult to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We brush our teeth every day. We take a shower every day. It's
just another hygiene habit. It's not a big deal,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the classes, both husband and wife are involved in the
process, Stavinoha said. For example, the wife takes her
temperature but her husband records it on the chart, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They both are aware of where she is on her cycle. It is the
business of the couple, not just the woman,'' Stavinoha said.
</P>
<P>
   Natural family planning strengthens marriages because the
husband and wife have to talk to each other, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both decide together when to have sex. This method helps you
build those virtues that help you have a long, faithful marriage,
virtues such as patience, kindness and self-control,'' Stavinoha
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wife and the husband do not take each other for granted.
The couple works together as a team. The rough spots are worked out
mutually and become a bond,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Stavinohas' class consists of four, two-hour sessions, set
one month apart. Couples' confidentiality is protected and the
Stavinohas also will teach individual couples natural family
planning, she said. Classes are held in English and Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   The next round of classes begins Feb. 21. A $50 fee pays for a
basal thermometer, charts, a natural family planning textbook and a
one-year subscription to the Couple-to-Couple League's newsletter,
Family Foundations, Stavinoha said, adding that she and her husband
are not paid for teaching the course.
</P>
<P>
   The league's World Wide Web site is www.ccli.org.

 &HT;    Coach Gibbs gets to players through criticismBy Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ For 20 minutes this afternoon, during the Denver
Broncos' only practice in pads before Super Bowl XXXIII, the
offense will gear up for its weekly nine-on-seven drill, a physical
session in which every play is a run and every run is between the
tackles.
</P>
<P>
   And then for hours tonight, dreading the weekly critique from
Alex Gibbs, several of the offensive linemen will find it
impossible to sleep because they are worrying about how the
Broncos' assistant head coach might embarrass them during video
review on Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The skull session, in which head coach Mike Shanahan basically
turns the team over to Gibbs, is a Broncos tradition in which the
lights go out, the videotape machine goes on, and the anxiety level
of every Denver offensive player goes up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just waiting for it is bad enough, especially if you had a bad
practice the day before,'' Broncos guard Mark Schlereth said. ``I
think the intensity of everyone in that room picks up when Alex
starts picking us apart. You sit there in your chair squirming and
thinking to yourself, 'Oh, man, don't let me be the brunt of his
jokes.' It gets pretty heated.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago, Gibbs employed a laser pointer to edify the
troops on their mistakes. He would point to the screen and tell
John Elway the quarterback's right foot had been five inches too
far outside on a handoff. He would point it again and show tailback
Terrell Davis exactly where the cutback lane would be on the
outside toss and then scold the league's premier runner on having
missed it by a foot. He would flick it on the celluloid image of a
tackle and insist that his hand placement was too high on the
defensive linemen.
</P>
<P>
   The laser pointer is history now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was replaced by his mouth,'' right tackle Harry Swayne
said. ``Nobody, and I do mean absolutely nobody, is immune. In that
room, on that drill, everyone is fair game.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs is one of the most brilliant but also one of the most
anonymous coaches in the NFL. He earned a master's degree in
European history, has a doctorate in education and has been known
to read 25 books in the offseason. He received his Ph.D. in
offensive-line blocking techniques long ago.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yeah, Gibbs, 57, is also a cross between the boogie man and
a CIA undercover agent, the guy lurking at the end of the dimly lit
alley who makes you take the long detour to get home. He is a man
of mystery who disdains the media, operates with great stealth and
speaks at the Super Bowl only because the NFL would fine him
$10,000 if he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the season he is off-limits and on-guard, insisting
that his charges follow his lead in ignoring anybody carrying a
notepad or a mini-cam. The linemen dined at the legendary Joe's
Stone Crab here Monday night with the $5,500 in kangaroo court
fines collected in 1998. Little of that money, claimed center Tom
Nalen, was the result of violating Gibbs' gag order ``He scares you
(into) silence,'' Nalen said.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Gibbs conducted his news conference Tuesday
from behind a pair of Oakley sunglasses. He could tell you why the
Broncos undersized offensive line ranks among the best in the NFL _
but then he'd have to kill you.
</P>
<P>
   A master motivator, Gibbs prepped under some of the game's
finest teachers and to this day considers himself more educator
than coach. He brags about having worked for Vince Dooley at
Georgia and pointed out Tuesday that one of his former bosses,
Woody Hayes, taught freshman English at Ohio State for 26 years and
never had a student fail.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it is his fear of failure that drives Gibbs and which
he has cultivated carefully in his offensive linemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paranoia is a great thing, under control,'' Gibbs said, biting
off each of those words. ``I love insecure linemen because I know
that they're all afraid of failing. The momentum of failure is one
of the most powerful elements I know. Truly, it is a positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he insisted on Tuesday that his strength is not as a
game-planner, Gibbs will design a blocking scheme around his
weakest link. The entire plan, every single play, Swayne agreed,
will revolve around protecting the most overmatched blocker. ``He
is obsessed with that,'' Swayne said. ``It's like, 'Who do we
double(team) to help someone out?' He doesn't want any
breakdowns.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs, who doesn't plan ever to be a head coach at any level, is
a grunt and knows it. He wants his linemen in his image. Of the
nine offensive linemen on the roster, just three began their
careers with the Broncos. The others were plucked from the league's
scrap heap or, in the case of left tackle Tony Jones, acquired in a
trade.
</P>
<P>
   The higher the draft round, the more worthy a lineman is to play
for Gibbs, who has told Denver officials he never wants them to
draft a blocker in the first two rounds. And he spends hours in the
videotape room, scanning other teams and perusing World League game
film. Already he has targeted a couple of linemen he figures will
be released soon by their current teams and whom he plans to claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let somebody else get them through their growing pains,''
Gibbs said. ``I don't want the job of doing that. I relish taking a
guy who's been beaten up a little bit. The guys who have been down
on their luck at some point _ those are my guys. Those kinds of
guys know about loyalty. Those kinds of guys will work their tails
off for you. Those kinds of guys want to show the world somebody
was wrong about them.''

 &HT;    HOW CAN CHRISTIANS BE CHRIST-LIKE IN POLITICS?
 &HT;    FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By Robin Galiano
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGVIEW, Texas _ Though Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was able to
maintain his nonviolent commitment to a righteous cause some 30
years ago, some observers say that Christians and politics today
make for a stormier brew.
</P>
<P>
   Some say the two just don't mix, that it's difficult for people
with strong Bible-based convictions to operate within a realm that
requires compromise to work. Others say believers have an
obligation to be ``salt and light'' to their communities and to
influence the nation for moral good.
</P>
<P>
   Since the rise of Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority in the 1980s
and Pat Robertson's 1988 bid for the presidency, Christians have
become increasingly active politically. It's not unusual today for
groups like the Christian Coalition to be tapped for their
responses to issues such as President Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In East Texas, Christians have gotten their foot in the
political door by being elected to school boards, and many with
pro-life sentiments have made significant inroads in the Gregg
County Texas Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   But some would argue there's an ongoing conflict with Christians
in politics: that some participants, especially those on the far
right end of the spectrum, are often unwilling to compromise, and
thus the political process itself comes to a standstill.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Christians have been known to pursue political
goals with tunnel vision, unwilling to back down on a single issue.
For instance, 1995 school board sessions in White Oak, Texas,
caused some Christians to stumble on ``hot button'' words, such as
``outcome-based education'' and ``multi-age classes'' in
discussions about education. And delegates to state political
conventions have argued vehemently about whether all abortion
should be illegal or whether instances of rape and incest should be
the exception.
</P>
<P>
   And some religious conservatives have been accused of being
mean-spirited and even vindictive in the midst of heated political
discussions _ all in the name of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   In the Jan. 11, 1999, issue of Christianity Today, Daniel Taylor
asks, ``How can we affirm Christian morality, unapologetically
rooted in the Bible, without becoming rhetorical bomb throwers?''
</P>
<P>
   Some would say it's difficult. And that perception seems to be
growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seen as the pit bulls of the culture wars _ small
brains, big teeth, strong jaws, and no interest in compromise,''
Taylor writes. ``Is this indictment fair? Often not.
Understandable? Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Kubricht, professor of history at LeTourneau University
in Longview, said it's the clash of values that often makes it
difficult to be ``Christ-like'' in politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rise of the Christian right was a response to increasing
secularism and what is perceived as antibiblical values,'' he said.
``Christian values were being challenged in the political arena,
and so they thought, 'We have to do battle.' And the history of
fundamentalism shows that they do battle. They'll take on Darwin or
whoever.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Keith Rothra, pastor of Judson Community Baptist Church in
Longview, said he entered the political realm because that's where
people had introduced ideas that were ``repulsive'' to his
religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's foolish for them to think that they can bring things like
abortion into the political realm and expect me not to respond,''
he said. ``I think abortion doesn't belong in the political forum _
it's a spiritual and moral issue. I'm just using the forum they've
chosen. In the American system, everyone has a right to press their
views.''
</P>
<P>
   Rothra, who has been a delegate to the state Texas Republican
Party convention, acknowledged that he had problems with the
``radical Religious Right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as I oppose abortion, I don't agree with those who say
all the way or no way. There has to be an element of compromise in
the political
</P>
<P>
   process. Those who hold out for the whole pie or none are going
to starve to death. Morally, I understand their position. But I
think their tactic is foolish.''
</P>
<P>
   The use of inflammatory words is another way Christians get into
trouble, Rothra said.
</P>
<P>
   On the national scene, for instance, members of an
ultra-conservative Baptist church showed up at the funeral of
Wyoming homosexual Matthew Shepard, carrying placards that read,
``God Hates Fags'' and ``Matt in Hell.'' And they quoted Scripture
verses to justify their stance.
</P>
<P>
   But while the actions of a few extremists may cause political
opponents to unfairly label all Christians as part of the Religious
Right or as ``fundamentalists,'' Christians are not as monolithic a
voting bloc as might be perceived, said Kubricht.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the conservative Christian community there are great
differences in how people respond,'' he said. ``Those coming from a
more evangelical framework, such as Evangelicals for Social Action,
see things much differently, but you hardly ever see other views on
the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media tend to focus on a few extreme examples, and ignore
the complexity of responses in the Christian community to these
issues. You don't see coverage of churches who have a significant
ministry to AIDS patients. Those who do things in a quiet way are
overlooked.''
</P>
<P>
   How can Christians maintain their heartfelt convictions without
tuning out those with whom they disagree?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think every religious group needs to tread lightly if they
want to be taken seriously in politics,'' said Dr. James Joseph,
assistant professor of political science at the University of Texas
at Tyler. This is especially true for conservative Christians, whom
he said are frequently perceived as ``wild-eyed, radical and
breathing fire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Any candidate from the religious right won't have much of a
chance, but they can still be influential,'' Joseph said. ``If
you're coming from the Judeo-Christian, it might be better to focus
on God being forgiving rather than talk about fire and damnation.
It's those kinds of groups that, even if you agree with their
views, they'll turn you off as a voter.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Herb Spady, pastor of South Longview Bible Fellowship,
said Christians who are willing to tackle political areas such as
race relations and abortion must first take an honest look at their
own lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of wielding the Bible as an object of judgment and
reproof, Christians need to read it and access the power that can
transform their own lives, families and this nation. 2 Chronicles
7:14 says that God's people have some wicked ways themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at someone like President Clinton and say, 'Look what
he did.' But who are we, as sinners ourselves, to judge? We do have
to pay the consequences of our sin, and for Clinton, that may mean
impeachment and removal from office. But to say he didn't really
mean it when he apologized, that he's not really sorry, that's
wrong. We're to love the sinner and not condemn him. We need to
stop judging him and start praying for our leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Spady, who was a speaker at the recent World AIDS Day gathering
in Longview, insisted that it is possible to hate the sin but love
the sinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the thing that all of us are supposed to do,'' he said.
``As Christians, we don't do that very well. Some of us hate the
sin and hate the sinner, too. We kill off the wounded, like people
with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there are Christians who are able to hate the drugs and
the homosexuality that brings on AIDS, yet they still love the AIDS
patients.
</P>
<P>
   That's the bottom line of Christianity. That's what God did when
He came to die for our sin.''
</P>
<P>
   As Daniel Taylor concludes in his magazine article, perhaps
Christians need to go beyond mere tolerance and become truly
loving, which he says is ``a far greater challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Love is not incompatible with judgment but it is incompatible
with our not properly valuing all that God has created, including
those who offend us.''

<P>
   c. 199 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   LONGVIEW, Texas _ Rex and Georgie Willcox have taken a pro-life
stand, and they're not afraid to let their neighbors know it.
</P>
<P>
   Their Longview home bears a banner that simply and unashamedly
reads, ``I Choose Life.'' But what's unusual is that the flag
carries an original design drawn up by Rex. It shows a baby in the
womb, surrounded by heart-shaped concentric circles of different
colors that represent racial diversity, and a flag of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Rex, who is a former evangelist, pastor and retired post office
worker, but not an artist, said he drew the design two years ago
after he experienced what he described as a spiritual prompting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lord gave me a vision, and I saw banners in front of
homes. I'm looking down on the United States, and everywhere
there's a banner, there's a connection. And all the time, the Lord
is saying, 'You're part of My people becoming one.' I came home and
asked Georgie, 'Do we have any colored pencils?' I drew it, and we
had it copyrighted.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgie Willcox, who taught at LeTourneau University in Longview
for more than 30 years and served as director of continuing
education, said some people told Rex the flag should say, ``Choose
Life.'' The couple, however, insisted the banners were to carry a
more personal message. ``This is not us telling you what to do.
It's just saying where we stand,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something we can all do,'' her husband added. ``People
see them and stop and say, 'Thank you for being a standard bearer.
I'm one, too.'''
</P>
<P>
   And it's catching on across the country. After putting an
advertisement in a national right-to-life publication, requests
came in so strong that the Willcoxes have installed a new computer
system to maintain a database for distribution of the flag.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who have requested one are Eagle Forum director
Phyllis Schlafly, Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., Rep. Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., and Family Research Council president Gary Bauer. And
they've learned that the international director of Priests for Life
took one of the flags to Rome to be blessed by Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's wonderful,'' Right to Life of East Texas director
Joe Dudas said of the banner. ``They're spreading the pro-life
cause in a very unique way. We've encouraged our members to
purchase a flag, and we have them available at our booth at the
Gregg County Fair.''
</P>
<P>
   For the flag's designer, however, it's more than a pro-life
statement _ it's symbolic of the way Rex Willcox believes
Christians should express the
</P>
<P>
   unity they have at heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue above this one is that God's people are one
people. Jesus prayed in John 17 that the Father would make us one
as He and the Father are one, and this prayer is to be answered
before we go to heaven. We are to see eye to eye and be perfectly
one. After all, the Father and the Son don't have any arguments.
Satan's biggest tool is to keep division in the body of Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   Willcox said when he realized the Lord might be speaking to him
about helping the church become unified, he was ``aghast.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was prejudiced myself. Everyone wants to hold onto truths
that are precious to them. I saw that we were in prison walls of
our own making. We just can't put people down or condemn them.''
</P>
<P>
   Willcox said the cause of ``stopping the killing'' might be the
thing to bring Christians together. ``It's for God's people to come
together who have been reticent, apathetic or indifferent. I myself
had to repent of that. This is not to scorn or rebuke. Years ago, I
could say the harshest thing about abortion, but I was still
indifferent about doing what I could about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The soft-spoken 72-year-old tears up easily as he describes his
passion for the unborn. ``We need a deep understanding of Jesus'
words, 'Inasmuch as you've done it to the least of these, you've
done it to Me.'
</P>
<P>
   ``When you begin to study the Scriptures about when life begins,
the plain naked Scripture, it's so clear that life begins in the
womb. Psalm 127 says the fruit of the womb is the Lord's treasure.
We are the product of God Almighty. Man's value diminishes as his
value of life in the womb diminishes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Willcoxes are so committed to making the banners available
that they've used a significant chunk of their retirement money to
produce them and have set up the nonprofit Sacred Heart Ministries
to distribute them. They sell them at cost to churches that can
resell them and use the proceeds for pro-life projects such as
establishing homes for unwed mothers.
</P>

HOUSE PROSECUTORS WANT TO TALK WITH CLINTON, THREE WITNESSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN and ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House prosecutors issued a surprise invitation
Tuesday to President Clinton to testify in a deposition for his own
Senate impeachment trial and said they also want to question three
others: Monica Lewinsky, presidential confidant Vernon Jordan and
White House aide Sidney Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors also asked the Senate to accept sworn statements
not already admitted into evidence from two minor players: Barry
Ward, a law clerk to the Arkansas federal judge in the Paula Jones
sexual harassment lawsuit, Susan Webber Wright; and T. Wesley
Holmes, one of Jones' lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The move by the prosecutors on witnesses set the stage for a
Senate vote Wednesday on whether to approve the requests, which
represent scaled-back versions of earlier plans for live testimony
from some of the key players on the Senate floor. Some Republican
senators such as Richard Shelby of Alabama were signaling their
reluctance to approve such a step.'
</P>
<P>
   The Republican prosecutors also appeared hopeful of convincing
senators that the impeachment trial would not be unduly prolonged
by the depositions, which are interviews under oath.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two people who know the most about this are Monica
Lewinsky and William Jefferson Clinton,'' Rep. Bill McCollum,
R-Fla., one of 13 House prosecutors. ``We think it is exceedingly
important ... for you to examine (Clinton) and these other
witnesses to get at the truth of this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been impeached for alleged perjury and obstruction
of justice in connection with the coverup of his affair with
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors said they were inviting him to give a deposition
because he was ``the one person who possesses direct and personal
knowledge'' of all the events surrounding the perjury and
obstruction of justice charges against him. ``His credibility is
critical in order for the Senate to resolve different inferences
from the factual record in his favor.'' The White House rejected
the invitation.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what House prosecutors hope to obtain from the other
witnesses:
</P>
<P>
   MONICA LEWINSKY
</P>
<P>
   McCollum called Lewinsky ``the one witness you and the American
people honestly do need to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's testimony roughly would cover the period from Nov. 5,
1997, when she first met Jordan to discuss his help in getting her
a job in New York, to Jan. 21, 1998, when her name first surfaced
in news reports.
</P>
<P>
   The House prosecutors believe Lewinsky's testimony would bolster
the version of events they have laid out in the Senate trial:
Clinton and Jordan intensified efforts to help Lewinsky find a job
after her name appeared on the Jones witness list, Clinton
encouraged Lewinsky to file a false affidavit denying a sexual
relationship with Clinton, and Clinton sent his secretary Betty
Currie to Lewinsky's apartment to retrieve gifts subpoenaed by
Jones' lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   In her grand jury testimony in August 1998, Lewinsky denied that
anyone had promised her a job for her silence or asked her to lie.
She also testified that Clinton said ``I don't know'' or ``let me
think about that'' when she suggested in their final meeting Dec.
28, 1997, that Currie retrieve the gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, prosecutors argued, Currie called Lewinsky, told
her ``I understand you have something to give me,'' and then drove
to Lewinsky's apartment to pick up the gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky also would be asked about a Dec. 17, 1998, phone
conversation when Clinton informed Lewinsky she was on the Jones
witness list. In that conversation, Clinton suggested Lewinsky
could avoid testifying by signing an affidavit and ``you can always
say you were coming to see Betty (Currie) or that you were bringing
me letters.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House position on this scenario is that Lewinsky said
on other occasions that Clinton said nothing when she broached the
subject of retrieving gifts; that since he never had sexual
intercourse with Lewinsky and that she could sign a
limited-but-truthful affidavit in the Jones case that they never
had sex; to avoid testifying.
</P>
<P>
   VERNON JORDAN
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors believe Jordan's testimony will prove that Clinton
encouraged Lewinsky to file the false Jones affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan at the time was in communication with both Lewinsky and
Clinton, and he was helping her get legal help in preparation for
the Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In her grand jury testimony, Lewinsky admitted her affidavit was
false and that she and Clinton in fact did have a sexual
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's testimony also will shed light on Clinton's role in
helping obtain employment for Lewinsky in New York in exchange for
false testimony in the Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, through Jordan, intensified efforts to find Lewinsky a
job after the appearance of her name on the Jones lawsuit witness
list, prosecutors assert.
</P>
<P>
   The job ``was intended to ensure Ms. Lewinsky's gratitude and
thereby discourage her from providing any damaging information
about her relationship with the president to the Jones attorneys,''
the prosecutors argued.
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers have insisted the job search was an
innocent, routine effort to help a Clinton friend find employment
outside of government, and was unconnected to Clinton's efforts to
buy her silence.
</P>
<P>
   SIDNEY BLUMENTHAL
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors want to question Blumenthal, a presidential
aide, to prove that Clinton obstructed justice by lying to
Blumenthal about his relationship with Lewinsky, knowing that
Blumenthal would repeat the lie to the grand jury. That constitutes
obstruction, the prosecutors argue.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told Blumenthal _ and Blumenthal told the grand jury _
that Lewinsky was a ``stalker.'' Clinton told Blumenthal that
Lewinsky had repeatedly made sexual advances and that he had
rebuffed them. Clinton denied to Blumenthal that he had a sexual
relationship with Lewinsky, adding that Lewinsky threatened to tell
people just the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors assert that the testimony from the aide will
prove that Clinton sought to attack Lewinsky's character in an
effort to exculpate himself, which they contend supports the
obstruction charge.
</P>
<P>
   David Kendall, Clinton's private lawyer, last week defended
Clinton on this charge by claiming that the president's statements
to Blumenthal and other aides was no different from what he told
the American people on national television.
</P>
<P>
   BARRY WARD
</P>
<P>
   A law clerk to Judge Susan Webber Wright, Ward was present at
Clinton's Jan. 17, 1998, deposition in the Jones case. At one point
during a debate over Lewinsky's affidavit, Clinton's lawyer Robert
Bennett pointed out the document said ``there is absolutely no sex
of any kind, of any manner, shape or form with President Clinton''
and asked the president to confirm it. ``That is absolutely true,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors accuse Clinton of perjury in that statement because
he failed to repudiate falsehoods in his deposition in his Aug. 17,
1998, grand jury testimony. He said that at the time, he was not
focused on what Bennett was saying. House prosecutors say Ward
could confirm that Clinton did, in fact, appear to be paying close
attention.
</P>
<P>
   T. WESLEY HOLMES
</P>
<P>
   One of Jones' lawyers, Holmes would be asked about the
circumstances leading up to Clinton's talk with Currie on Jan. 18,
1998, the day after Clinton was asked repeated questions about
Lewinsky in his Jones deposition.
</P>
<P>
   According to the prosecutors, Clinton tried to enlist Currie's
support for his false version of the Lewinsky relationship, trying
to get Currie to agree with him that he and Lewinsky were never
alone, and that she wanted to have sex with him but he refused.
House prosecutors have argued that this amounts to obstruction
since Currie was a likely witness in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   In his deposition, Clinton denied a sexual relationship with
Lewinsky and suggested Currie could back up his version of events.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say Holmes could confirm that based on Clinton's
testimony about Currie, the Jones lawyers zeroed in on the
secretary as a key witness and issued a subpoena to her on Jan. 22.
For that reason, prosecutors argue, Clinton must have known Currie
would be a witness and his attempts to sway her testimony amounted
to obstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not Currie was to be a witness is crucial because an
element of the law on obstruction requires prosecutors to show
interference with an actual witness in a legal proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   The White House legal team has argued Clinton had no idea Currie
would be a witness, and that he was concerned with the potential of
a media ``firestorm'' growing out of the Jones lawyers' questions
about Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   TELEPHONE RECORDS
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors want to submit records of a Dec. 6, 1997, phone
conversation between Clinton and Lewinsky that lasted 56 minutes.
On that day, Clinton learned for the first time that Lewinsky was
on the Jones lawyers' witness list. Later that same day, Clinton
intensified his effort to win Lewinsky's silence with a job,
according to the prosecutor's theory.

WITNESSES MAY HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO TESTIFY BEFORE SENATE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, who knows well the perils of
testifying under oath, can rely on constitutional doctrine to avoid
testifying before the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But other potential Senate witnesses _ his former paramour, a
long-standing confidant and a trusted aide _ could face the risk of
perjury if they fail to tell senators the truth. They might have no
legal recourse but to testify before the Senate in the president's
impeachment trial, a Houston law professor and a criminal defense
attorney said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors, aware of the president's constitutional
protection against testifying before Congress, have urged the
Senate to request, but not compel, Clinton to give testimony in his
impeachment trial. In contrast, the prosecutors, or ``managers'' in
impeachment trial vernacular, have pressed the Senate to order
Monica Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan and Sidney Blumenthal to testify.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate could vote as early as Wednesday on the prosecutors'
request.
</P>
<P>
   The constitutional separation of powers between the president
and Congress affords Clinton legal footing to ignore a
congressional demand that he give testimony, said University of
Houston professor David Crump.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Kent Schaffer, by contrast, said Lewinsky, Jordan and
Blumenthal would have little constitutional protection against
testifying about the president's allegedly illegal efforts to
conceal his extramarital affair with Lewinsky. These efforts, as
argued by the 13 House prosecutors, include lying before a federal
grand jury and obstructing justice.
</P>
<P>
   The separation of powers doctrine, while not expressly mentioned
in the Constitution, has long been interpreted to mean that
Congress, short of passing a law, cannot compel the president to
act, Crump said. The only price Clinton would pay for refusing to
comply with the Senate's request for testimony would be the wrath
of senators who regard his silence as an admission of guilt and
vote for his conviction and expulsion from office, the professor
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The separation of powers protects the president from being at
the beck and call of Congress,'' said Crump, a constitutional law
expert. ``The president could come to the Senate voluntarily.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate could in theory take Clinton to court for refusing to
testify, arguing that the separation of powers doctrine does not
protect the president from having to appear at his impeachment
trial. The Constitution, while containing an implied separation of
powers, also gives the Senate the ``sole'' power to try
impeachments. Therefore, it might allow the legislative body to
compel the president's testimony, Crump said.
</P>
<P>
   But no federal court would have authority to settle the dispute.
The Supreme Court has held that the Senate's singular authority
over impeachment trials prohibits courts from ruling on matters
regarding how senators conduct the proceeding, the professor said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the other potential witnesses, Schaffer said that
Lewinsky would be barred from citing the Constitution's Fifth
Amendment privilege against self incrimination. The reason is that
she has signed an agreement with independent counsel Kenneth Starr
immunizing her from prosecution in return for her truthful
testimony about her relationship with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Because she will not be prosecuted as long as she tells the
truth, Lewinsky has no fear that her testimony would incriminate
her and would therefore be ``stuck'' with having to testify, said
Schaffer, president of the Texas Criminal Defense Lawyers
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, Clinton's close friend, and Blumenthal, an aide to the
president, have not signed immunity agreements but may have waived
their Fifth Amendment rights by testifying before a federal grand
jury investigating the Lewinsky scandal. Having already spoken
under oath about what Clinton told them about his relationship with
Lewinsky and what they did in response, the two men may now be
prevented from remaining silent about their actions and those of
the president, Schaffer said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Jordan and Blumenthal would be able to cite the Fifth
Amendment if House prosecutors seek testimony on matters the two
did not discuss before the grand jury, the attorney said. The
prosecutors, in urging the Senate to allow them to question
witnesses, said they would seek new testimony but were not
specific.
</P>
<P>
   However, Schaffer seemed unconvinced, noting that Starr and his
assistants relentlessly quizzed Jordan and Blumenthal before the
grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can you ask Vernon Jordan that he didn't already say?''
Schaffer said, noting that Jordan appeared before the grand jury
for five days. ``What in the world are the Republican congressmen
going to come up with?''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan and Blumenthal, if House prosecutors ask the same
questions, could urge the Senate trial's presiding judge to excuse
them as witnesses because their testimony would be a mere
repetition of what they already told the grand jury, Schaffer said.
Jordan and Blumenthal could argue that the effort to get them to
testify amounts to ``pure political harassment'' and would not add
to the trial, an argument that Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist,
the presiding judge and a stickler for procedure, might accept,
Schaffer said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Senate would retain the final word on whether
Jordan and Blumenthal would have to testify. Under Senate
impeachment trial rules, senators can overturn the chief justice's
rulings by a simple majority vote taken at the request of a single
senator.

`A MAJORITY OF ONE': HEALING WAR SCARS WITH ROMANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes are at end of review.) 
(lb) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lessons in life, love, forgiveness, racial tolerance
and global economics are delivered with comic flair by an expert
cast in the winning revival of ``A Majority of One'' at the Jewish
Repertory Theater.
</P>
<P>
   As nostalgic as its references to the bygone era of the B.
Altman department store, the Albee theater and fox stoles, this
1959 comedy by Leonard Spigelgass at Playhouse 91 (316 East 91st
St.) is nevertheless as up to date as the latest dispute with Japan
over free markets.
</P>
<P>
   Although its story of a Jewish widow from Brooklyn and a wealthy
Japanese manufacturer and widower who develop an attraction aboard
a ship bound for Yokohama, Japan, remains basically unchanged, this
production of the 25th anniversary season of the Jewish Repertory
Theater is noteworthy for its casting.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the popular 1959 production, in which Cedric Hardwicke
portrayed the industrialist, Koichi Asano, opposite the inimitable
Gertrude Berg as the widow, Bertha Jacoby, or the unexceptional
1962 film version, in which Alec Guinness co-starred with Rosalind
Russell, this revival gives the pivotal male role to an actor of
Asian descent, Randall Duk Kim.
</P>
<P>
   And Kim delivers an altogether captivating performance
characterized by warmth, dignity, charm, comic spirit and
intelligence. None of this is to slight Phyllis Newman as Mrs.
Jacoby, who, favoring character over caricature, is always wise,
staunch, decent, funny and, when called upon in Act II, as good
company as someone drunk on sake is ever likely to be.
</P>
<P>
   Set 40 years ago, this comedy rakes over the scars of war to
come to grips with a changing world. The sideboard in Mrs. Jacoby's
Brooklyn apartment still bears two little American flags and a
photograph of her son, David, who died of wounds inflicted by the
Japanese in the battle for Attu in the north Pacific. Sixteen years
may have passed since David's death, but as Mrs. Jacoby says, ``By
me, it's like yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   To complicate matters, her married daughter, Alice (Julia Dion),
and son-in-law, Jerry Black (Danny Gurwin), arrive with news.
Jerry, rising in the Foreign Service, has been assigned by the
State Department to Tokyo as a junior economics officer, and major
trade negotiations are coming up.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to live with the people who killed your
brother?'' the distressed Mrs. Jacoby asks Alice.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Jacoby also realizes that the world is in flux, and
soon she is bound for Japan with Alice and Jerry aboard the ship
that carries Asano and his memories of a son killed aboard a
Japanese destroyer and a daughter, a nurse who died in the atomic
bombing of Hiroshima.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Mrs. Jacoby begins to overcome her antipathy toward
Asano, Jerry and Alice suggest that he may have ulterior motives
for his attentions, because he will be a participant in the
impending trade negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   In time, matters will sort themselves out.
</P>
<P>
   Under the direction of Richard Sabellico, the performances are
deft and the proceedings savory. The sets by Todd Edward Ivins
possess a sharp cosmopolitan eye that extends from the dark, heavy
furnishings of Mrs. Jacoby's place on Eastern Parkway to the light,
simple furnishings of the Asano home in Tokyo, premises enhanced by
the lighting of Richard Latta and the costumes of Gail Baldoni.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the principal players, actors like Mio Takada as
Asano's baleful servant, Konrad Aderer as the Blacks' manipulative
houseboy, Elaine Grollman as Mrs. Jacoby's neighbor, and Ako as
Asano's daughter-in-law make significant contributions to the
evening's considerable pleasures.

MOODY'S DOWNGRADES MAZDA DEBT
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Moody's Investors Service, the credit rating agency,
lowered its ratings on Mazda Motor Corp.'s long-term unsecured debt
to below investment grade Tuesday, citing continued deterioration
in the Japanese car market.
</P>
<P>
   The company, in which Ford Motor Co. holds a 33.4 percent stake,
had expected the downgrade and said it would have little effect on
its bottom line this fiscal year, which ends March 31, largely
because Mazda has no need to borrow money before then.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman declined to comment on the company's plans for the
next fiscal year. The company has been working hard to cut its
costs, in part by keeping its borrowing to a minimum, and it
expects to post its first profit on a consolidated basis in six
years this fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Moody's said the senior unsecured debt rating for Mazda was
lowered to ``Ba1'' from ``Baa3,'' moving the company's rating below
investment grade. The agency also characterized the rating outlook
for Mazda as negative. Lower ratings signal more risk for investors
and tend to increase a company's borrowing costs.
</P>
<P>
   The downgrade, which affects about $2.8 billion worth of
securities, could have negative implications for the troubled
Nissan Motor Co., analysts said. Nissan, which has nearly $24
billion in debt, still enjoys an investment-grade rating, and most
analysts regard Mazda as a much better credit risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Mazda's rating down, there's really no reason for Nissan
not to be downgraded further,'' said Koji Endo, an auto analyst at
Schroders Japan Ltd.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Moody's said it was concerned about how a stronger yen and
rising interest rates would affect Mazda. The strengthening of the
yen makes Mazda's cars more expensive overseas, thus making it
harder for the company to make up for sales drops in the domestic
market.
</P>
<P>
   And rising interest rates will push up the cost of existing debt
for Mazda and for its domestic dealership networks, the ratings
agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Mazda's president James Miller said at a news conference Friday
that Moody's decision to put Mazda's debt under review last
December ``shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone'' given its
actions related to other Japanese companies, including Toyota Motor
Corp. Toyota, which is widely regarded as one of the world's most
financially sound companies, lost its ``AAA'' credit rating last
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Miller noted at the meeting that Mazda had managed to cut its
debts in half since Ford took control in 1996 and imposed strict
cost-cutting measures. ``We have a clear vision of what we must do,
and we believe we will regain the confidence of the ratings
agencies by our future performance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Mazda said the company planned to redeem and
refinance 105 billion yen worth of bonds, or almost $930 million,
before the end of the fiscal year. The company plans to refinance
35 billion yen and use 33 billion yen of cash flow and 37 billion
yen withdrawn from cash and time deposits.
</P>
<P>
   Mazda's largest market is Japan, where sales of cars have
declined for the last 21 months. Last week, Miller said that the
company expected the market to shrink 3 percent next year, to fewer
than 5.7 million units, of which 1.6 million units will be
lower-margin minicars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect 1999 to be a very, very challenging year,'' he said.

GEORGE L. MOSSE, 80, HISTORIAN, EXPERT ON EUROPEAN FASCISM
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Wis., Pa., Iowa, N.Y., Mass., Israel, Germany) (bl) 
By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   George L. Mosse, a University of Wisconsin history professor who
was an authority on European fascism and Hitler's Germany, died
Jan. 22 at his home in Madison, Wis. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   Mosse was selected to be the first scholar-in-residence at the
Holocaust Museum in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, he was praised by Professor Gordon Craig of Stanford
University, then the dean of American historians of Germany, for
his book ``Germans and Jews: The Right, the Left, and the Search
for a `Third Force' in Pre-Nazi Germany'' (1970, Fertig).
</P>
<P>
   In The New York Times Book Review, Craig said Mosse cast ``much
light on the characteristic attitudes of rightist intellectuals''
and showed how it was possible for some of them ``to shut their
eyes to Hitler's brutalities.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Mosse also revealed ``the desperate nature of the
search'' by Jews in Germany in the three decades before Hitler came
to power in 1933 ``for a means of integration with a society that
rejected them, desperate because in some cases it led to their
adoption of the ideology and elitism of their most virulent
enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   Mosse, who pronounced his name MOSS-ee, was both John C. Bascom
Professor of European History and Weinstein-Bascom Professor of
Jewish Studies at the University of Wisconsin, whose faculty he
joined in 1955. He was also Koebner Professor of History at the
Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He retired from all three of those
posts in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier book which Mosse edited and wrote an introduction
for, ``Nazi Culture: Intellectual, Cultural and Social Life in the
Third Reich'' (1966), he provided a description in some detail of
what happened to cultural life in Germany after Hitler became
Germany's dictator.
</P>
<P>
   Some areas of cultural activity were hardly touched, but others
felt a huge impact: some academic fields were done away with, and
others evaporated because most people working in those fields had
to flee Germany. That work was praised as ``a very illuminating new
source book'' by Walter Laqueur, then director of the Institute for
Advanced Studies in Contemporary History (The Wiener Library) in
London.
</P>
<P>
   A significant essay by Mosse, ``Toward a General Theory of
Fascism,'' was also first published in 1966. It appealed for more
comparative studies of fascism and for more far-reaching research
on the subject. That call, as Frederick Ludwig Carsten, a historian
of Central Europe, observed in 1981, was heeded by numbers of
younger political scientists and historians.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s Mosse wrote about the broader impact on cultural
life in Europe of World War I, the Holocaust and other cataclysms.
A Princeton historian of modern Europe, Anson Rabinbach, said
Mosse's book ``Nationalism and Sexuality'' (1985, Fertig) ``is a
path-breaking study of how stereotypes like `healthy' and
`degenerate' and `normal and abnormal'' underlay what became the
persecution of Europe's Jews, homosexuals, Gypsies and the
insane.''
</P>
<P>
   Mosse wrote more than two dozen books, and his other writings
included reviews in The Times Book Review.
</P>
<P>
   The many honors he received included the American Historical
Association's award for scholarly distinction and the Leo Baeck
Medal.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Berlin and was a grandson of Rudolf Mosse, the
publisher of the liberal Berlin newspaper the Berliner Tageblatt.
The Nazis denounced the Mosse family, shut the newspaper and forced
the family, which was Jewish, to flee Germany in 1933.
</P>
<P>
   After some years in Britain, George Mosse came to the United
States and earned a bachelor's degree in 1941 from Haverford
College and a doctorate in 1946 from Harvard. During his academic
career he also taught at the University of Iowa, Cornell, Cambridge
University and Tel Aviv University.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his partner, John Tortorice of Madison, and by
a niece, Joy Mosse of Beverley Hills, Calif.

 &HT;    WHAT IS A 'BLUE DOG?'
 &HT;    With BLUE-DOGS.
 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A ``Blue Dog'' refers to a conservative or moderate Democratic
member of Congress. In fact, 29 members belong to a Blue Dog
Coalition that focuses mostly on fiscal issues, such as pursuing a
balanced budget.
</P>
<P>
   Even members, however, are not sure about the origins of the
term. Some say Louisiana has had Blue Dog Democrats going back as
far as the one-party days of the 1920s and '30s, with Blue Dogs the
conservative Democrats, and Yellow Dogs the ultra-conservative
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But the modern Blue Dogs can be traced back to the early 1980s,
according to Rep. Billy Tauzin of Louisiana, a former conservative
Democrat who has become a Republican. Tauzin said Louisiana
Democrats came up with the name ''Blue Dogs'' as an alternative to
''Boll Weevils,'' a group of more than three dozen mostly Southern
House Democrats who banded together to support Ronald Reagan's
economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, when a new group of conservative Democrats was
searching for a name for a coalition, Rep. Jimmy Hayes, another
Louisiana Democrat who later switched parties, showed up at one of
the group's meetings with some of his old Blue Dog lapel pins from
the 1980s. And the rest is history.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one more Louisiana connection. Hayes happened to be
a friend of Louisiana artist George Rodrigue, who has become famous
for his paintings of a wide-eyed Blue Dog. Hayes arranged for each
member to receive a print of one of the paintings, which has led to
a common belief that the ``Blue Dog'' label came from Rodrigue's
painting. The truth is that the artist was creating a tribute to
his departed pet, Tiffany.

 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Waco Democratic Rep. Chet Edwards realized a while
back that his party needed some mending.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a dysfunctional family in 1994,'' he said. ``The first
step was to rebuild some trust and respect within our own caucus.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards' solution: socialize. Together with Reps. John Lewis,
D-Ga. and Vic Fazio, D-Ca., Edwards organized a series of dinners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fascinating,'' he said of the meals that brought
together traditional Democratic liberals with their often ignored
conservative Democratic colleagues. ``People who had been here six
and eight years (had) never gotten to know each other.''
</P>
<P>
   In the years since, Edwards has become a conduit between
moderates and conservative Democrats and their party leaders _ a
role that could become increasingly vital as the party moves to the
center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to continue to be a bridge builder,'' he said. It's a
position that could result in big political payback if Democrats
take over the House in 2000 on the strength of conservative
districts.
</P>
<P>
   It is obvious things are already changing for conservative
Democrats, known as ``Blue Dogs.'' Just a few years ago, they
rarely got floor time or a good committee assignment. Now, they are
increasing in number and in clout.
</P>
<P>
   It can be seen in plans for a Leadership Council, which would
serve as a key policy-making arm under House Minority Leader
Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.). The group, comprised of representatives
from the five key caucus coalitions, will include one member from
the conservative Blue Dogs and another from the moderate New
Democrat Coalition, which has 50 members and is now the largest
sub-group in the caucus.
</P>
<P>
   In a further sign of the conservatives' new status, Gephardt
plans to include a member from the Blue Dogs in his routine Tuesday
morning meetings of top leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Max Sandlin, D-Marshall, is a ``Blue Dog'' who thinks
conservatives are the key to a Democratic majority in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious that the Democratic party has become more
moderate and has moved to the middle,'' Sandlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Working for a balanced budget and education issues resonates
with the public, he said. ``The party more accurately reflects
middle America today.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandlin, in his second term, is part of a batch of somewhat
recent arrivals who are finding strength in numbers. With such a
slim GOP majority in the House, moderates and conservative
Democrats are critical to passing any meaningful legislation, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us in the middle can often times control the vote and
that puts us in a very important position.''
</P>
<P>
   In November, 23 newly elected Democrats came to Washington. Of
those, 15 have joined one of the two right-leaning groups, and
Sandlin said he expects a few more to join. In the previous
election, Blue Dogs recruited and financed candidates for the first
time. Six of the 13 candidates endorsed by the group were elected.
</P>
<P>
   The New Democrat Network, the outside political arm of the NDC,
won 26 of the
</P>
<P>
   34 races it targeted in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said he will continue to make sure the voice of
moderates and conservative Democrats is heard in the policy-making
arena. Unlike the GOP, he added, the Democratic party has learned
from its mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are letting the most extreme factions within their party
dictate public policy, just as Democrats let the most extreme
liberals do that for many years,'' he said. ``They are being pulled
so far to the right that they are getting outside of the mainstream
of the country.''

DEMOCRATS BRACE FOR DEFEAT IN FIRST IMPEACHMENT TRIAL SHOWDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle, conceding
defeat on the eve of showdown votes in President Clinton's Senate
impeachment trial, said Tuesday the Republican-led Senate will
admit witnesses and rebuff a White House effort to win dismissal of
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle, who leads the Senate's 45 Democrats, conceded that the
Senate will vote Wednesday to approve the House prosecutors' plan
to summon former White House intern Monica Lewsinky, Clinton
confidante Vernon Jordan and White House staffer Sidney Blumenthal
for sworn testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors said they wanted to take the depositions to
resolve disputes that have arisen in the three-week Senate
impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Senators said a decision on the procedures for the witnesses
would await Senate action Wednesday on the proposal to admit
witnesses to the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle, referring to witnesses, said they were ``inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., echoed Democrats' resignation. ``I
feel there shouldn't be witnesses, but if we are going to have
witnesses, everybody ought to have all the witnesses they want,''
Leahy said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., said House prosecutors' decision to
narrow their witness list to three made Senate approval more
likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``My instincts say that will pass,'' Coverdell said.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., scheduled Senate
votes on Wednesday beginning at 1 p.m. EST on a motion to dismiss
the case offered by Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., and the request by
the House prosecutors to have the Senate subpoena Lewinsky, Jordan
and Blumenthal and Clinton to give a deposition.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials reiterated that Clinton will not submit to
questioning by the Senate _ in person or in writing. ``It's time to
wrap this up,'' said White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   After debating the proposal to call witnesses, the Senate
retreated into a closed-door session to deliberate before emerging
for public votes on the two motions on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle warned that the first substantive Senate vote of the
impeachment trial may shatter the bipartisanship that has generally
prevailed at the trial. Daschle said 45 Senate Democrats will vote
to dismiss the impeachment case and against admission of witnesses
while the Senate's 55 Republicans will vote against dismissal and
for the admission of witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been able to largely avoid partisan votes until now, but
I'm skeptical,'' Daschle said. ``I think on the vote on dismissal
and on the vote on witnesses, it sounds as if the lines may be
drawn.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, predicted that some Democrats will
break ranks Wednesday to join Republicans to reject dismissal of
the case and to support the admission of witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow will be a red letter day for the Constitution,'' said
Gramm. ``I do not believe (Democrats) can be a solid united group
of people who are going to oppose the constitutional process to get
to a verdict,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials expressed concern that they may suffer
defections by Sens. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., Bob Graham, D-Fla.,
and possibly John Edwards, D-N.C.

</P>
<P>
   Republicans said the decision by House prosecutors to cut the
proposed witness list from upwards of 15 witnesses to only three
witnesses helped cement the support of GOP moderates for having
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, said he was more inclined to vote
in favor of calling witnesses in light of the smaller witness list.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said the Senate may set a deadline for depositions to be
complete from the three witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is we'll set a date certain, like Monday, that this
all has to be done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said the pared-down list may persuade other Republicans
_ and even a few Democrats _ to vote to depose witnesses. Several
Republicans, including Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska, said they want
to have witnesses deposed but do not want to see anyone testify
publicly on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   With Democrats bowing to defeat on the question of witnesses,
some senators shifted their focus to the procedures that would be
used. Some Republicans urged that the depositions be videotaped to
permit the witnesses' testimony to later be shown to senators on
the floor of the Senate without calling the witnesses themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., circulated proposed ground rules for
deposing witnesses that called for each witness to be interviewed
for four hours _ split equally between the House prosecutors and
Clinton's lawyers. Chafee suggested videotaping the private
sessions for senators to view.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James E. Rogan, R-Calif., said House prosecutors decided to
limit their witness request to three because the lawmakers had been
``picking up lots of intelligence'' that narrowing the request to
three witnesses would garner the support of at least 51 senators.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan said House prosecutors went back and forth selecting the
witness list to ``politically strategize'' on the best balance for
making the case against Clinton without alienating a wavering
senator on calling witnesses at all.

 &HT;    Though not illegal, nutrition products supplied to players a
touchy subject with NFL
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Most of the Broncos admit it. They play with a 13th man.
He lives in a suburb of Denver and the NFL has grown weary of his
act.
</P>
<P>
   He is EAS, Experimental and Applied Sciences, a small company
located in Golden, Colo., that produces a line of sports-related
nutrition products, some of which cross the lines of the NFL's drug
policy. EAS supplies the creatine that flows freely in the locker
room; even team owner Pat Bowlen and coach Mike Shanahan use it.
Players so frequently wear EAS-adorned clothing that the league
resorted to fining them for promoting a product not licensed by the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
   And while none of the Broncos has been punished by the league
for using the EAS product Andro-6, the NFL was suspicious enough
last summer that it warned about illicit use of androstenedione,
after the Mark McGwire flap in baseball. EAS was the only firm
mentioned in the league's letter.
</P>
<P>
   To the Broncos, EAS is a large component of the team's success.
To the NFL, the company is a pain in the corporate rear.
</P>
<P>
   ``With EAS, you know it's a nutrient,'' said wide receiver Rod
Smith, a big client. ``It makes your body perform at it's maximum.
So why not use it? It can't hurt you. That's the thing. It can't
hurt you.''
</P>
<P>
   Then why is the NFL so spooked by EAS?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really want to comment on the league about EAS,''
Smith replied. ``I don't want to get myself in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   It might be too late for that. The league has been on the
Broncos about EAS for more than a year. Linebacker Bill Romanowski,
quarterback John Elway, running back Terrell Davis and tight end
Shannon Sharpe are paid endorsers for the company. Romanowski is
believed to receive a six-figure fee as a spokesman. The company's
name and logo were displayed conspicuously by Broncos players
during the 1997 championship drive, and today, paunchy Denverites
wear EAS apparel with no idea what the company is. Some still
believe EAS stands for ``Elway And Sharpe.''
</P>
<P>
   The league has gone to battle about such blatant logo display,
threatening to fine players after the first round of the playoffs,
when many players wore EAS hats and turtlenecks in post-game media
sessions, in disregard of the closely monitored licencing policy.
The league threatened to levy $10,000 fines and double them for
future violations. The team was in complete compliance for
Tuesday's media day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue came up last summer about the rules on (non-licenced
apparel on) game day,'' said Greg Aiello, the NFL's vice president
for public relations. ``Do those (uniform) rules apply to the
locker room after the game? And the answer is yes. I think what's
happened is they now understand the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   But the EAS flap is about performance enhancers, not clothing.
The creatine issue and long-term effects of the widely used
supplement, which develops muscle mass, are still unknown. Yet EAS
uses the highest-profile players on one of the NFL's high-profile
team to promote it.
</P>
<P>
   It is estimated that 75 percent of the Broncos use EAS products,
most of them creatine. More than half of the Falcons also use
dietary supplements, including creatine, amino acids and various
protein drinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very beneficial to athletes when taken correctly,'' Sharpe has
said. ``Should be for highly skilled athletes, not to be toyed
with, not to be played with. . . . Carefully supervised. Very
misunderstood.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the federal Food and Drug Administration approved the
substance, creatine has come under increasing criticism for side
effects, including a potential for causing dehydration, which
prompts cramping. It is commonly found now in high-school locker
rooms, but some NFL teams -- Tampa Bay, Washington and Cincinnati
among them -- have banned its use.
</P>
<P>
   Andro-6 is a far more serious matter. It is on the NFL's banned
substances list. After the McGwire publicity, the NFL reiterated
its stance against steroid use. Androstenedione and
dehydroepiandrosterone both are banned substances, and both are in
Andro-6, which increases testosterone levels in the bloodstream to
promote muscle growth. McGwire, of the St. Louis Cardinals, used
Andro while breaking baseball's single-season home-run record last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Both substances also can mask steroids in a player's system.
Results from NFL drug-testing are confidential, and it is unknown
if any Broncos have tested positive for Andro-6. Bill Phillips,
EAS's chief executive officer, no longer takes calls from the
media, but he told the Rocky Mountain News last year, ``I would
never recommend to any Olympic athletes I coach or pro athletes to
use Andro-6. It can increase the testosterone levels enough to give
a false positive on a drug test.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is an unsavory aspect to the performance-enhancing
industry, the Broncos seen to be oblivious to it. Romanowski
reports that he is stronger and faster in his 11th pro season,
because of a grueling conditioning program and Phillips' input. It
was Romanowksi who first exposed the rest of the team to EAS.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got with Bill Phillips two years ago, he put together a
nutritional program for me that's helped me considerably,''
Romanowski said. ``With how I train and how I take care of myself,
I've been able to improve myself every year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If it makes a guy feel he has the extra energy or whatever it
takes,'' Smith said, ``hey, you're going to use it. If I'm training
and someone says you can be the caliber athlete of Michael Jordan
if you take this powder, you think they're not going to take it?''

 &HT;    All walks of media life meet Super Bowl participants
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ He was dressed to the canines. Silver britches. Black
No. 34 Falcons jersey. A silver diamond hoop earring dangling from
each ear. And around his neck, Ray Buchanan wore a studded dog
collar.
</P>
<P>
   A thick, black leather dog collar, covered with silver studs
that glistened in the South Florida morning sun. Some guys just
know how to accessorize.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing it for fun, for the media,'' said Buchanan, the
Falcons Pro Bowl cornerback. ``They got us as a seven-point
underdog. So I thought I'd wear my dog collar.''
</P>
<P>
   So he dressed for excess for Tuesday's Super Bowl XXXIII Media
Day. What did teammate Bob Whitfield think of Buchanan's neckwear?
``I think he needs to wear it on his hips,'' Whitfield said. ``Ray
Buchanan looks like a Teletubby.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Media Day, the NFL's hour of babble, the photo op
where a picture is worth 1,000 wordsmiths and TV crews from ESPN to
Japan to ``Comedy Central'' converge. On Tuesday morning at Pro
Player Stadium, the Falcons underwent their Media Day baptism. The
fun began at 8:45 a.m., with the scoreboard clock set at 60:00. The
highlight clock is running:
</P>
<P>
   59:31 _ While walking across the field, Jamal Anderson filmed
the stadium and assembled media with a digital video camera.
Sitting down at one of 10 podiums reserved for coach Dan Reeves and
nine talkative Falcons, Anderson switches to a 35-mm. camera and
snaps four group shots of the media in front of him while advising,
``Be natural. Smile. Don't look posed.''
</P>
<P>
   When a man asks, ``Can you send one to my mother?'' Anderson
replies, ``For 10 bucks.''
</P>
<P>
   53:42 _ Beth Littleford, a correspondent for ``The Daily Show'',
is grilling backup safety Chris Bayne: ``The Dirty Birds is a
professional nickname. Does it apply to your personal life?'' Uh,
no. Then this: ``You're on special teams. How special is special
teams?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Real special,'' Bayne said. ``That's why they call them
special teams.''
</P>
<P>
   49:18 _ Keith Brooking is preserving the festivities with his
camcorder. It's the rookie's second Media Day in Pro Player. Last
season, Brooking and Georgia Tech played here in the Carquest Bowl.
``This is a little different, believe me,'' Brooking said. Total
Carquest media? ``Probably 100.'' None from German TV.
</P>
<P>
   42:20 _ Cornelius Bennett, the linebacker who lost four Super
Bowls in a row with Buffalo, is momentarily startled by a question:
``Who was more responsible for making you lose all those games, Jim
Kelly or James Lofton?'' Then Bennett spies the interrogator:
Lofton, standing beside Kelly, both ex-Bills now working in TV.
</P>
<P>
   36:37 _ Sometimes Whitfield can be reserved. Not now. Not even
when asked about being blind in his left eye. ``Who said that?''
Whitfield asked, covering his right eye. ``I can't see you.''
Pointing to his artificial eye, he said, ``It's big, ain't it? I'm
Cyclops.''
</P>
<P>
   29:51 _ Lesley Visser, the ABC sportscaster, finishes an
interview with O.J. Santiago, then asks the tight end, ``Can I
borrow your earrings?''
</P>
<P>
   24:31 _ More Whitfield, when asked to compare Anderson and
Denver's Terrell Davis: ``There's Jamal . . . .'' Long pause. ``And
there's everybody else.'' Three, four, five times he repeats it.
Later, when asked about Bronco quarterback John Elway, Whitfield
says, ``There's Jamal . . . .'' Long pause. ``And there's everybody
else.''
</P>
<P>
   19:22 _ Morten Andersen is one of several Falcons seated in
their own sections in the stands. The place-kicker from Denmark
answers in his native tongue to TV2 Sporten, of Danish television,
when Dom Irerra of ``Comedy Central'' follows up in Brooklynese:
``Oh, Morten, you don't really believe that, do you?'' Anderson
laughs. More Dom: ``Why do you think you're going to be the MVP?
Are you going to have sex before the game? Wait 'til halftime?''
</P>
<P>
   15:51 _ In section 139, team president Taylor Smith speaks
fondly of his late father, Rankin, when he's interrupted by a guy
with a cell phone: ``Mr. Smith? The Fabulous Sports Babe would like
to talk to you.'' Far more courteous than any TV type, Smith says,
``OK, now. I've got some other people here I'm talking to.''
</P>
<P>
   12:04 _ Several Falcons rookies and backups, ignored, lean on a
rolled-up baseball tarpaulin. Others sit in the Marlins dugout. Not
Robbie Tobeck. The center poses in the stands with the flag of
Wales wrapped around him. The Falcons have a sister city in Wales;
if they win Sunday, they'll donate $50,000 to a Welsh charity.
</P>
<P>
   9:22 _ ``Dan,'' asks a TV guy, ``can you spell your last name?''
Dan Stryzinski smiles for the camera: ``S-T-R-Y-Z-I-N-S-K-I.'' The
punter earlier declined a Japanese TV crew's offer to wear a white
headband adorned with Japanese characters. ``We'll be fined
$100,000 if we wear unlicensed NFL stuff,'' he said,
straight-faced.
</P>
<P>
   5:25 _ And yet more Whitfield, on what it's like to block for
Anderson: ``You know what it's like to run naked on the beach in
Rio de Janeiro with the rain hitting your butt? It's not like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   0:00 _ Time's up. The Falcons depart. The media reassembles
upstairs in Pro Player for brunch before descending on Denver. A
woman videotapes a closeup of granola, then a sweeping panorama of
grazing media. And one sports writer wonders what the rest of Media
Day will be like: ``You think Elway will have a dog collar on?''

 &HT;    Broncos want to get to Chandler through pressure from quick
front
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ It isn't often that a team wins two Super Bowls in a row
with only one defensive lineman in the same position he played the
previous year. But that's what the Denver Broncos will attempt to
do Sunday night against the Atlanta Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   One of the several keys for the Broncos, however, will be just
how well their retooled defensive front pressures Falcons
quarterback Chris Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   ``They build a pretty good wall around (Chandler),'' defensive
end Neil Smith said. ``What they've been doing lately is using max
protection, and they do it pretty well. You have to keep fighting
your way through those layers of protection to get to the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Falcons reshuffled the front group, coordinator
Greg Robinson's defense recorded 47 sacks this season, No. 7 in the
league. The Falcons surrendered 53 sacks, sixth-most in the NFL.
The perception is that the Falcons offensive line improved in
December, but it still allowed 12 sacks over the final four
regular-season contests.
</P>
<P>
   Much like the Falcons defense, the Broncos front creates
pressure with quickness and relentless desire. Robinson likes to
send linebacker Bill Romanowski on a third-down blitz from the
outside. In last year's Super Bowl, however, Robinson also designed
some blitzes for linebacker John Mobley, the quickest of the
Broncos' front seven. Denver also likes to blitz a nickel defender
out of the slot, but some of the Falcons formations might preclude
that move. What the Broncos might attempt to do is take advantage
of fullback Brian Kozlowski, the former tight end filling in for
Bob Christian. Some of the Broncos noted privately Tuesday that the
Atlanta running backs aren't solid pass-blockers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is, we have to bring as much heat as we can
with our front-four guys,'' defensive end Maa Tanuvasa said. ``We
have to take it on ourselves to get to Chandler as often as
possible. Hopefully, our quickness will help us.''
</P>
<P>
   The new-look line clearly is quicker than the Broncos unit of a
year ago and evolved in part because of Robinson's need for speed.
Injuries also played a role in forcing some of the switches. The
lone lineman starting in the same position as he did in last year's
Super Bowl is right tackle Keith Traylor.
</P>
<P>
   Tanuvasa, a former tackle, moved to end when Alfred Williams had
biceps surgery early in the year. Harald Hasselbach replaced Smith
at left end. Trevor Pryce, a second-year veteran from Clemson, was
promoted to starter at left tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Williams usually play in the nickel defense, and
Tanuvasa sometimes moves back inside, where his ability to wiggle
through the gaps is advantageous. Of his 8 1/2 sacks this year,
five came when he moved from end to tackle.
</P>
<P>
   It is Pryce, though, who has proved to be right for the Broncos
pass rush. In his first season as a starter, he recorded 8 1/2
sacks. When he lines up in the gap he can be dangerous, especially
when Traylor occupies two blockers. At 285 pounds, Pryce lacks the
usual bulk of a tackle, but at 6 feet 5 he has natural leverage,
and he has learned to use his hands well.
</P>
<P>
   Only a year ago, some Denver insiders were suggesting that Pryce
was a flop.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has probably grown up as fast in one year as any player
we've had,'' Broncos coach Mike Shanahan said. ``His improvement
has been tremendous.''

   The New York Times News Service will move the following
entertainment/arts articles this week for release Sunday, Jan. 31,

</P>
<P>
   MARTHA-GRAHAM-DANCE (New York) _ Monday, one day before opening
a three-week season at the Joyce Theater, the Martha Graham Dance
Company will vacate the school and studios at 316 East 63rd Street,
where Graham taught and choreographed for 40 years before she died
in 1991. The small brick building will be demolished, sold to pay
off debts, retire a $1.5 million mortgage and establish an
endowment. By Anna Kisselgoff.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   RUSHMORE-FILM (Undated) _ Wes Anderson, the 29-year-old director
of ``Rushmore,'' which opens on Friday, is as singular a
personality as Max, his comic creation. Where Max is flamboyant,
however, Anderson is quiet. Underneath this reticence, though,
lurks a gentle fierceness that has enabled him to make two
thoroughly offbeat films within the Hollywood studio system.
Anderson wrote both ``Rushmore'' and his first movie, ``Bottle
Rocket,'' with his friend, and fellow Texan, Owen Wilson. By Laura
Winters. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   FEMALE-FILM-DIRECTORS (Undated) _ ``Directing is the final
frontier,'' said the producer Gale Ann Hurd, who was involved with
``The Terminator'' and ``Armageddon'' and who knows a bit about the
perils of breaking into a male bastion. ``It's the one area where
women have made no real inroads.'' In fact, while the 1980s saw
dramatic gains _ the number of women directing studio releases rose
from zero to 7 percent or 8 percent of the total _ those figures
have remained flat through the 1990s. By Nancy Hass.
</P>
<P>
   ORGAN-DONATIONS-FILM (New York) _ Early last month at the New
York Public Library's Donnell branch, a standing-room-only
screening was held of ``The Kindness of Strangers,'' a 104-minute
documentary that provides a close look at organ donation and
transplantation from the personal perspective of donors, survivors,
recipients and their families. When the lights came up, teary
audience members could be seen fishing for their drivers' licenses
and filling out the organ donor consent information. By Jean
Nathan.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BLUE-HEART-THEATER (London) _ ``Blue Heart,'' one of two one-act
plays by Caryl Churchill was widely acclaimed in its London debut
nearly 18 months ago at the Royal Court Theater, where critics
praised an ever-adventurous dramatist _ perhaps Britain's most
consistently daring _ as well as a cast that illuminated fully what
in lesser hands might have come across as a stunt. The double-bill
made its American debut last Friday at the Brooklyn Academy of
Music's Majestic Theater, following an international tour last
year. By Matt Wolf.
</P>
<P>
   MAKEOVERS-THEATER (Undated) _ The retooled ``Scarlet Pimpernel''
has given theatergoers a rare glimpse of the critical role played
by the directors of Broadway musicals. Yet when you talk to them
about what they do for a living, they resort to simple metaphors
that belie the complexity of their task. They will tell you the job
is about finding a rhythm, seeing a picture, hearing a motor. Or
maybe making an arc, weaving a spell, taking a journey. By Sylviane
Gold. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CUNNINGHAM-GRAHAM-PHOTOS (Undated) _ Imogen Cunningham
photographed Martha Graham in the summer of 1931, in Santa Barbara,
Calif. They worked outside, in front of the barn at Graham's
mother's home. The afternoon was hot, the smell unpleasant and the
flies bothersome, but together they managed to produce a collection
of nearly 90 images, an extraordinary double-portrait of both
photographer and choreographer. By Ann Daly.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   FELDMAN-MUSIC (Undated) _ It may not be helpful to living
musical practitioners to know this, but death does wonders for a
composer's reputation, at least as measured by representation on
CD. Numerous recordings of works by Luigi Nono, John Cage, Witold
Lutoslawski and Toru Takemitsu have come too late for them to hear,
and the posthumous crescendo is even more spectacular in the case
of Morton Feldman. At the time of his death, in 1987, the CD
catalogue included barely a handful of his pieces. Now his whole
immense output is heaving into view, and the peaks are beginning to
become evident. Most recently, three releases have started to
repair the neglect of his orchestral compositions. By Paul
Griffiths.
</P>
<P>
   SCHOENBERG-MUSIC (Undated) _ Arnold Schoenberg probably gets the
nod as the most reviled composer in history. So when the
Metropolitan Opera presents its first production of his masterpiece
``Moses und Aron'' on Feb. 8, more of the animosity the composer's
music has always attracted will undoubtedly be whipped up. By
Anthony Tommasini.
</P>
<P>
   LIEBERMAN-MUSIC (Undated) _ No one is bolder in his embrace of a
tonal, lyrical and Romantic past than Lowell Liebermann. And not
coincidentally, perhaps, Liebermann, 37, a New Yorker, has been
blessed with enthusiastic audiences and big-name performers, many
of whom rarely champion contemporary music. Just now, Liebermann
seems to be everywhere at once. His opera ``The Picture of Dorian
Gray,'' based on the novel by Oscar Wilde, will receive its
American premiere on Friday at the Florentine Opera in Milwaukee.
Two weeks ago, the Dallas Symphony Orchestra and its music
director, Andrew Litton, appointed Liebermann
composer-in-residence, a three-year position to take effect in the
fall. The New York Philharmonic has scheduled the premiere of his
Trumpet Concerto in May 2000. And BMG Classics recently released a
disk of his flute music, played by James Galway. By K. Robert
Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   JAZZ-MUSICIANS-ABROAD (Undated) _ Since the be-bop era, jazz
musicians seeking a better life have landed with their suitcases on
the shores of Europe. In cities like Paris, Stockholm and Berlin,
they have found steady work, low rents, congenial audiences and a
more hospitable racial climate. But for all its attractions, living
abroad has seldom advanced the art itself. By Adam Shatz.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TEN-ARTISTS-EXHIBIT (Undated) _ At the little-known Mercury
Gallery in Boston, a mostly forgotten group of American artists
from the 1930s is the focus of an exhibition that also turns
attention to the group's sole surviving member, a very fine painter
named Joseph Solman. The show in Boston (through February) is about
the Ten, as the group chose to call itself, somewhat eccentrically,
considering that there were only nine of them in the beginning.
(The numbers changed over the years.) Solman was the youngest
member and became something of a ringleader. By Michael Kimmelman.

</P>
<P>
   CARAVAGGIO-ART (Boston) _ Since it was rediscovered in the
Jesuit Residence in Dublin in 1990, Caravaggio's ``Taking of
Christ'' has left Ireland only twice. In 1995, the painting spent a
month at the National Gallery in London and two months in Rome.
``The Taking of Christ'' was not scheduled to leave Dublin _ where
the Jesuit Fathers have left it on indefinite loan at the National
Gallery of Ireland _ for the next 25 years. Yet Monday it will be
on view in Boston, as the centerpiece of ``Saints and Sinners:
Caravaggio and the Baroque Image,'' a show of 17th-century Italian
religious art that opens at the McMullen Museum of Art at Boston
College, through May 24. By Ken Shulman.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-HOLOCAUST (Undated) _ Television and the Holocaust are
clearly an odd couple, says Jeffrey Shandler, who teaches in the
department of Hebrew and Judaic studies at New York University. But
they are also ``age mates,'' having entered the American
consciousness around the same time. And more than film or art or
literature, Shandler says, the much-maligned small screen is
responsible for turning the Holocaust from a calamity befalling a
foreign people in a different time and place into a ubiquitous,
paradigmatic part of American culture. By David Margolick.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANTIQUES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   FOLK-ART-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ Outsider art continues to upstage
American folk art in gallery and museum exhibitions as well as in
the press. But at the auctions, traditional American folk art
chalks up spectacular prices for the choicest examples, while the
quirky, visionary Outsider art lags far behind in the prices
fetched at auction. This month's folk-art sales began with the
proverbial bang at Christie's when two extraordinary paintings by
Edward Hicks rewrote the records for the artist and for folk art.

ENJOY SUPER BOWL FROM COMFORTS OF HOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOMMY CUMMINGS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To enjoy the atmosphere of Super Bowl XXXIII, you don't have to
be in balmy Miami, Fla., soaking up the ocean spray in a rented
sports car while speeding down Biscayne Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, simply pull up a seat in the den, boot up the computer and
watch it unfold on the 'Net.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of big-media sites give Super Bowl XXXIII a big presence
online. These resource-rich sites all have the components of a
quality site: updated content, easy navigation and interactivity.
</P>
<P>
   And they all have unique features.
</P>
<P>
   Here is one Web surfer's guide to the best of the Super Bowl
sites:
</P>
<P>
   BEST PREVIEW: CBS SportsLine
(www.sportsline.com/u/football/nfl/superbowl/xxxiii) has lots of
cool features that the other sites have, but none has EA SPORTS'
video-game simulation of this year's Super Bowl. Using Madden NFL
'99, the Denver Broncos won, but not before the Atlanta Falcons
bolted to a 22-0 lead. CBS SportsLine has a breakdown of the
simulated game, complete with still images and statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Best editorial content: CNN/SI
(cnnsi.com/football/nfl/1998/playoffs) taps the resources of Sports
Illustrated and CNN correspondents. If you like to read, this is
the place to go. And if you like the magazine's dynamic photos, the
site has a high-resolution image gallery loaded with Super
Bowl-related photos. Users can zoom into the images _ as if they
have an online magnifying glass _ for closer looks.
</P>
<P>
   BEST FANTASY GAMES: ESPN.com
(espn.go.com/nfl/playoffs98/superbowl) gets fantasy football
enthusiasts back online with its Fantasy Super Bowl Tournament and
Super Bowl Over/Under features.
</P>
<P>
   For the tournament, ESPN.com editors selected an all-time roster
for each franchise from all the players who ever wore its uniform
in a Super Bowl. Eight teams were seeded based on their Super Bowl
records. The San Francisco 49ers, who are 5-0 in Super Bowls, are
the No. 1 seed and the Cowboys, 5-3, the No. 2 seed. Votes cast by
ESPN.com users will decide a champion this week. It's a good way
for Cowboys fans to make some noise during Super Bowl week.
</P>
<P>

IN THE WORLD OF TV, EXPERIENCE IS SOMETHING THAT COUNTS AGAINST
YOU
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Carl Reiner is speaking of writing, of comedic
composing, of being in the zone. He has felt this before when no
one was around, when it was late and dark and there was just him
and his words, which seemed to gush like oil from a busted pipe.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers the feeling vividly, back when he was the living
mechanism fueling ``The Dick Van Dyke Show,'' back when his calls
were returned and TV executives waited patiently on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's pushing 70 and wouldn't be shocked if the pimple-faced
programmers asked if ``that's Reiner with an `e', sir?'' and could
he please fax over his credits?
</P>
<P>
   He knows how the business works; after all, he worked it for
years. But it doesn't matter when it comes to the words. They've
been flowing, just like in the old times, for this television pilot
he's written, and it has made him excited and intrigued, if also
somewhat nervous about facing a world that's changing right under
his feet.
</P>
<P>
   He knew he had to come see the pimple faces, to hear their
thoughts, and he did. He made a couple references to major actors
to play major parts and they frowned and chuckled and asked
``Who?'' which made him realize there's a problem selling something
to anybody who's not riding the same vibe.
</P>
<P>
   Seems his concept had to be a high-concept ``Friends'' or a
low-concept ``Seinfeld'' or something that would put them in the
mind-frame of something else. What is it? they begged.
</P>
<P>
   He walked out wondering if he has fallen too many steps behind
the game, whether the language of the day is no longer his own. He
talks of the ``classic language,'' which still buzzes within him
with so much force that he has written a book of short stories that
will be published this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Writers have to write,'' he says. ``I'm not going to ever stop
writing. I'll find some way to write, even here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here'' is television, a medium where the more experience you
have, the less useful you are. A place where surgical knives carve
out fountains of exterior youth. A place where writers near or over
50 are virtually shut out and shut down because they're considered
too old and too out of touch and too unhip to write anything for
viewers 18-to-34.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the latest Writer's Guild report and see how the rate of
employment decreases after age 30. Last season, 77 weekly series
had no writers over 50. Few over 40. No wonder older writers cut
off their 1970s credits. No wonder 32-year-old Riley Weston duped
The WB into thinking she was 19 just to get a writing gig. No
wonder the older guys sit around dazed and confused and questioning
why series TV today require an army of producers when they were the
lone wolves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty names,'' Reiner says. ``Four executive producers, each
executive producer has his personal executive producer, and each
story editor has a story editor to produce the story. I've never
seen so many names needed to put out a 22-minute show.''
</P>
<P>
   So the pimple faces look for kindred souls and graze in their
own splendor of naivete, cross-pollinating and socializing like
killer bees, which is how it has always been done. Reiner knows.
His kindred souls know. The twist is that back then, the older,
more experienced writers got the gigs and younger folks waited in
the line forming at the rear. Stand there and learn, kid, and be
the better for it.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Lear, he of ``All in the Family'' and ``The Jeffersons,''
thinks his writers could tear it up today because the comedy has
held up like Super Glue. Ask TV Land. Ask Nick at Night. ``But so
many of the executives that are buying the ideas, passing on the
ideas, at all the networks and cable stations, are very young
(people) whose greatest theatrical or entertainment involvement was
with the television tube _ not with the stage and film and
literature,'' Lear says.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the way kids behave on television through the years of
their growth is the way they think kids behave. So that's why
you've got so many (smart-aleck) kids on television that have no
relationship to the children you have in your home. And everything
works that way. If their involvement is with the tube, they're
thinking about ideas that work in that context today.''
</P>
<P>
   Lear wonders whether they are capable now of thinking outside
the box, if it's too late. Will network television as we know it
die under the weight of cable? If not, will it simply become a
victim of sameness?
</P>
<P>
   Meryl Marshall, president of the Academy of Television Arts and
Sciences, which will induct Reiner into its Hall of Fame next month
figures there's room, too, for the golden agers to make a return,
but with more savvy and less ego.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work with people with whom we're most familiar and most
comfortable,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``But also, if the music that we listen to is not the same music
that the audience, the young audience, is listening to, and a buyer
is looking to meet that young audience, we have to ask ourselves
whether we're operating in a context that's appropriate and whether
we have the language, the mannerisms, the stories that they need
and want to be able to hear and enjoy. So we have to accept some
responsibility for crossing that bridge ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Reiner knows this and understands this, but it has nothing to
with the flow, the gushing of words, the zone. He's back, at least
in his mind, when he's sitting down and ``I feel exactly the same
way as I did when I was doing `Van Dyke Show.'''
</P>
<P>
   So he'll sit and he'll write and he'll wait. The words will
flow. Or ``fly'' as he calls it. And he'll feel the way he used to.
Alive.

RETAILERS TRYING HARDER TO SELL WARES ON WEB, BUT FUTURE IS
ANYBODY'S GUESS
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by RETAILING-WEB SITES) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LILA LAHOOD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a growing belief among traditional retailers regarding
online shopping: No one knows how big it could get, but in the
meantime, more are unwilling to risk the wait unwired.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping on the Web still accounts for a small fraction of U.S.
retail sales. But the segment is growing quickly, as more Net
surfers scrap the drive to the mall for a seat in front of the
computer at home. During the 1998 holiday season, consumers spent
about $115 billion in all, $2.3 billion of which was spent online,
double what was spent during the 1997 holidays, according to
Jupiter Communications, a New York research firm.
</P>
<P>
   And even though many retailers say they have low expectations at
this point for Internet sales, stores ranging from J.C. Penney to
Pier 1 Imports are stepping up efforts to get established on the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your competition goes online, it becomes imperative that
you go online,'' said David Szymanski, associate director of the
Center for Retailing Studies at Texas A&AMP;M University. The emergence
of online bookseller Amazon.com, for example, prompted retailer
Barnes &AMP; Noble to launch a Web site in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It's not hard to find retailers on the Web. They have used it as
a way to draw customers into the stores, announce events,
test-market, and track customer buying habits.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart, a giant discounter, offers 175,000-250,000 items
online at any given time, more than you'd find in a Wal-Mart store.
Pier 1 and Tandy Corp., operator of Radio Shack stores, plan to
sell products online this year. J.C. Penney, which launched its Web
site four years ago, plans other sites directed at targeted
audiences beginning this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Wal-Mart example aside, retailers typically limit the
merchandise they offer online to a smaller selection of what they
carry in their stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``If nothing else, the retailers are using it as advertising
more than to sell products on the Web,'' with the main objective
being to draw shoppers into the real store, said George Gillen, a
Dallas partner with the PricewaterhouseCoopers consulting and
auditing firm.
</P>
<P>
   That is Pier 1's strategy, says chairman and chief executive
Marvin Girouard.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to create a $15 million business on the
Internet and lose $15 million with your store sales,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pier 1, based in Fort Worth, sells gift certificates and offers
bridal gift registry services on its Web site. It plans to start
selling merchandise online in May and will offer about 400 items
online, compared with about 4,500 in an average Pier 1 store.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to go gently into it,'' Girouard said.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth-based Tandy, which operates 7,000 Radio Shack stores
nationwide, has similiar views.
</P>
<P>
   The company uses its Web site to display products and provide
store location information, and it expects to start selling online
this year. Tandy does not expect online sales to cut into store
revenues, spokesman Ron Trumbla said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People talk about hits,'' Trumbla said, referring to the
number of visitors to a Web site. ``We get, every day, 1 million
living, breathing people who walk into our stores.''
</P>
<P>
   The growth of online retailing has started becoming evident
within the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   Among traditional retailers, Penney was an early entrant to the
field, posting its Web site in 1995 and launching sales the
following year. Since then, the company has refined its strategy,
viewing the Web as a logical extension of its stores and catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Its first site aimed at a specialized audience _ this one for
full-figured women, a group that has been ``historically
underserved,'' spokesman Michael Ponder said _ will be launched in
the spring.
</P>
<P>
   The site will let customers build rotating ``models'' of
themselves, including choices for size, hair and skin tone, and
then use the models to try on clothing and solicit advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes a catalog for one,'' Ponder said.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring out what consumers will buy online is a key challenge
facing the traditional stores.
</P>
<P>
   Books, compact discs, computers and electronics, tickets and
services have shown the most success in online sales because they
``are easy for the customer to evaluate without touching or trying
on,'' Szymanski said.
</P>
<P>
   Also high on the list are what Al Meyers, director of retail
strategy for the Senn-Delaney unit of Arthur Andersen in Dallas,
calls destination and repeat purchases _ items the consumer already
is familiar with: ``Anything that's a model number, a particular
brand that can be compared and cross-shopped,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many other challenges of online retailing mirror those of the
catalog business. Sizes are not uniform, and colors displayed in a
2-inch graphic will look different on a full-scale product. Returns
are inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers that don't have catalog experience might have
difficulty building the internal structure to deliver orders
efficiently, Gillen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you start to disappoint people because you can't get the
product there, you could lose customers,'' Gillen said.
</P>
<P>
   How successful online retailing will eventually be is anybody's
guess.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts predict online services that browse the Web and
identify sites with the lowest prices. ``That could dramatically
lower margins in the business on brand-name products,'' Meyers
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gillen expects online sales to net between 5 percent and 8
percent of the retail market within a few years. It's harder to
tell how long it will take for retailers to establish a profitable
Internet business.
</P>
<P>
   That depends on how long it takes for consumers to fully embrace
online shopping. ``There's still something about going and touching
a lot of products that's important to people,'' he said.

   As online retailing grows, traditional stores are moving to
improve their presence on the web. Here's a sampling:
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart (www.wal-mart.com)
</P>
<P>
   Offers 175,000-250,000 items for sale online at any given time,
compared with the 80,000-100,000 items you would find in Wal-Mart
stores and supercenters. Want a book on fishing? This Web site
offers 45. Wal-Mart also offers built-to-order computers
exclusively through its Web site, and it has an online partnership
with FTD florists. ``You're going to find many of the same items
you would find in a store, but you would find a bigger selection of
videos and books and CDs because you're not limited by a physical
store,'' spokesman Bryan Holmberg said. Wal-Mart, like most
retailers, is not believed to do a significant portion of its $100
billion-a-year-plus in revenues from the Web and does not disclose
those figures. But its market position as the world's largest
retailer and its high level of sophistication in moving merchandise
from supplier to stores make it a player to watch in online
retailing.

   IMPEACH-RDP (Washington) _ Ledeall: Even as House prosecutors
today offered a short list of witnesses to appease skittish Senate
Republicans, outside the chamber Democrats angrily countered that
summoning witnesses was unnecessary and would significantly prolong
President Clinton's impeachment trial. The skirmishing came on the
eve of two crucial votes. Senators on Wednesday will likely vote
against dismissing the case, along party lines. But a vote on
whether to depose the three witnesses House managers want to call,

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Some Senate Democrats said Tuesday they will
seriously consider a resolution drafted by Sen. Dianne Feinstein,
D.-Calif., condemning President Clinton's conduct in trying to
cover up his affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton's impeachment trial continued in the Senate,
lawmakers in both parties made clear they still believe that
Republicans will be unable to muster the two-thirds majority needed
to remove him from office on perjury and obstruction of justice
charges.

<P>
   Feinstein's resolution would censure him for both having the
affair and then concealing it from his cabinet, other government
officials and the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The measure does not deal with the perjury or obstruction of
justice charges approved by the House of Representatives but
instead focuses on presidential misconduct. The resolution neither
clears the president of criminal behavior nor implicates him.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., had
agreed to take up her resolution following Senate action on the two
articles of impeachment now being tried.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., said Feinstein's resolution is the first
of what will likely be a number of proposals that Democrats will
consider before bringing a censure plan to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very good place to begin,'' Reed said of the
resolution. He added that lawmakers need to find the exact,
appropriate wording to ensure the resolution passes constitutional
muster.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the very beginning of this process, I thought censure was
appropriate,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., said many senators feel that if Clinton
is acquitted, ``something needs to be on the record'' that condemns
him for his actions.
</P>
<P>
   Some conservative Republicans have said they won't back such a
measure. For instance, Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, has argued that
the Senate cannot censure a president because it would violate the
separation-of-powers clause in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   But DeWine said a number of Republicans may find the censure
option appealing if the Senate votes against articles of
impeachment. Republicans control 55 seats while the Democrats have
45 seats. A simple majority vote would be needed to approve a
censure resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein's measure would be considered as a non-binding
resolution that does not require a House vote or Clinton's
signature. Both the House and Senate often approve non-binding
resolutions on various subjects such as supporting U.S. troops in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats maintain that if a censure resolution is non-binding,
it will not pose any constitutional problems.
</P>
<P>
   There is an outside chance, however, that the Senate may never
get to an actual vote on the articles themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, has proposed that the Senate simply
vote to adjourn and accept the House charges of perjury and
obstruction of justice as the ``highest form of censure'' against
Clinton without having the Senate take its own vote on the charges
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Feinstein's proposal, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.
said it now appears that witnesses will be called and that there's
no way to tell if censure will come up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you start a trial process, you don't know where and how
it's going to end,'' Schumer said. He added that the atmosphere is
likely to get highly partisan and ``that could damage the Senate
not just now but later on.''

KING HUSSEIN RETURNS TO U.S. FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ Only hours after anointing a new heir, King
Hussein flew back to the United States on Tuesday for urgent
medical treatment prompted by what his doctors said were
indications that his cancer might be recurring.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors said the king, 63, had suffered fevers and
blood-count abnormalities since returning to Jordan on Jan. 19. He
was heading directly to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., where
he had spent six months in treatment for non-Hodgkins lymphoma.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday morning the new crown prince, Abdullah, 36, was sworn
in at the airport to run the country in his father's absence. He
replaces Hussein's brother, Prince Hassan, who was crown prince for
34 years.
</P>
<P>
   The king's abrupt leave-taking added to a sense of unease
evident in Jordan, whose residents are still digesting the
surprising news that Abdullah, a career soldier with little
experience of politics, now stands next in line for the throne.
</P>
<P>
   And now Jordan faces once again the prospect that the king, who
has had diagnoses of cancer twice in the last six years, may be
sicker than anyone knows.
</P>
<P>
   Official photographs taken at a ceremony on Monday night, when
Hassan handed his portfolio to Crown Prince Abdullah, showed the
king leaning on a walking stick. Although he piloted his own plane
back to Jordan last week from London, where he had been recovering,
Jordanian officials said he was a passenger on the flight to
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very unfortunate development,'' said Mustafa
Hamarneh, director of the Center for Strategic Studies at the
University of Jordan. ``In my view the country needs the king more
than ever. Crown Prince Abdullah is very new at this, and it's
extremely critical that the king be around for a number of years in
order to give the young prince a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Before returning to Jordan, the king told his subjects that he
was ``fully recovered'' from his latest illness.
</P>
<P>
   He underwent six sessions of chemotherapy and a bone-marrow
transplant during his stay at the Mayo Clinic and had not been
scheduled to return for a follow-up examination until March. As he
left the clinic on Dec. 29, doctors there pronounced him in good
health.
</P>
<P>
   But the king's personal doctor, Lt. Gen. Samir Farraj, told
reporters in the Jordanian capital Tuesday that because of the
nature of the king's symptoms, ``I, as well as doctors from the
Mayo Clinic, thought it best to send him back to the clinic for
checkups and treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   An official statement reported that ``after his majesty's
blessed return,'' his doctors had noticed ``an occasional increase
in his temperature and, they feared, as a result of initial tests,
a lack of blood cells produced by the bone marrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement noted that the king had stood in an open car in
wintry rain for hours last Tuesday to acknowledge the hundreds of
thousands of people who lined his route to welcome him home.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the decision that he should return to the United States
so quickly suggested that this was being treated as more than a
passing episode.
</P>
<P>
   The events of the last week have also raised the question of
whether the king's apparent haste in altering the line of
succession in favor of his son had been motivated by a knowledge
that he remained ill. That is a question to which no one in a
position to know has volunteered an answer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The king has battled illness successfully before: In 1992 he
underwent surgery to remove a kidney after the discovery of
cancerous cells. In 1997 he had prostate and lymph-node surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The news of his abrupt departure seems to have affected many
Jordanians and to have intensified a critical focus on Abdullah, an
army major general who heads Jordan's special forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``The king has been here so long I don't know what Jordan would
do without him,'' said Jamal Khader, 32, a shopkeeper on a downtown
Amman street. ``They say Abdullah is a good man, but we don't
really know him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rami Khouri, a Jordanian political columnist, said, ``Some
people will no doubt express legitimate concerns over his capacity
to run affairs of state, primarily because Abdullah is untested.''
</P>
<P>
   The air of uncertainty was heightened, Jordanians said, by the
public release of a letter from the king to Hassan that offered an
uncommon glimpse into tensions within the royal family.
</P>
<P>
   In it, the king told his brother that he had been stripped of
his title of crown prince in part because Hassan and his supporters
had been acting as if the king was already out of the picture.
</P>
<P>
   The king wrote that he had been forced to intervene ``from the
sickbed'' to halt a shakeup of top army officers under Hassan that
he said would have amounted to ``a settling of scores.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On top of my personal suffering, I was for the first time
pained in my own life,'' the king said of the episode. He said he
had also been deeply hurt by what he labeled a vicious whispering
campaign that he said Hassan's supporters had directed against
Hussein's American-born wife, Queen Noor, and their four children.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most critically, the king also suggested that Hassan had
stood in the way of his own plans to establish a family council
that might have ruled that power should pass first to Hassan and
then to one of Hussein's sons.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, the king disclosed for the first time that he had
considered abdicating in his brother's favor in 1992, after his
cancer diagnosis that year. But he said he had decided against that
course, and suggested strongly that the reason had been a belief
that Hassan would have been determined to appoint his own son as
his heir.
</P>
<P>
   In a reply, Hassan was contrite. ``I put myself in your hands
and abide by your honorable order,'' he said of the decree that
designated Abdullah as crown prince.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When their gazes drifted upward, toward a
four-sided gallery recently packed with reporters, foreign tourists
and even the stray Hollywood celebrity or two, senators saw only
empty seats and, behind those vacant rows, something that had been
invisible to them for the last few hectic weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You sat there looking up at the busts of the vice
presidents,'' said Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., referring to the
marble statues lining the outer, upper rim of the Senate chamber.
``Usually, they are camouflaged with thousands of people teeming
around.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the impeachment trial of President
Clinton began, Frist and other senators noted, there was relative
stillness: no revolving groups of spectators streaming in and out,
no aides scurrying to and fro.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a greater hush, especially Monday night, when
senators addressed one another without benefit of microphones. If
the colleague speaking was disinclined to shout, other senators
sometimes left their seats, strayed informally toward the well of
the chamber and leaned in close to listen.
</P>
<P>
   It was ``more intimate, more personal,'' Sen. John Kerry,
D-Mass., said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., agreed. ``We stripped away the
theater,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual closed-door debates that the Senate held Monday
night and again Tuesday afternoon and evening did not yield
agreement among senators on a number of points, including whether
they were proper and whether they were helpful.
</P>
<P>
   But there was almost unanimous consensus, in interviews with
more than a dozen senators Tuesday, that the atmosphere of these
sessions was rare and extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, this is a new process for almost everyone in the
Senate,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, saying that the only other
closed sessions he and many other senators had ever participated in
were national security briefings from outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very specific, and very limited in time,'' Gramm
said. ``Nothing like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday evening, the doors to the chamber closed for more than
four hours for a debate on a Democratic motion to dismiss the
charges against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday afternoon, the doors closed again for a debate on a
Republican motion to depose three witnesses. Suddenly, the hundreds
of spectators were asked to leave, and for several
movement-crippling minutes, they packed the third-floor hallways
outside the chamber, a startling reminder of the abrupt transition
inside from public proceeding to private conference.
</P>
<P>
   On both days, the television cameras in the chamber were turned
off, the reporters sent away. Senators could not summon aides to
their sides and, on Monday, could not use microphones.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, although the main audio system was again shut off and
senators could not use the microphones at their desks, a portable
microphone attached to two loudspeakers was made available to them.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, the senators were bound to a code of secrecy
about the content of their discussions. Any violation could, under
Rule 29 of the Standing Rules of the Senate, lead to ``expulsion
from the body.''
</P>
<P>
   Several senators, seemingly relishing this aura of mystery,
joked that the penalty could be even worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I tell you anything,'' Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, said
late Monday, ``they'll hang me by my thumbs.''
</P>
<P>
   A majority of Democrats had voted not to close these debates,
while a majority of Republicans wanted them held in secrecy, so
assessments of how useful the sessions were often split along party
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Most Republicans said the sessions promoted candor and comfort.
``If the public could see it, they would demand that we do it more,
not less,'' said Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would see people talking to each other instead of at each
other,'' Smith said. ``It's really remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Without television cameras, Smith added, ``people assume a
different posture.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., had apparently observed an
entirely different proceeding Monday night, after which he said he
concluded that ``senators are theatrical even in the privacy of
their home showers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't detect any noticeable change in demeanor,''
Torricelli said Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., said many senators seemed confused by
the sudden isolation. Imitating them in a mocking fashion, he said:
``Where do I look? Who do I talk to? What about these cards I want
to use? Where is my staff to tell me what to say?''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., one of the few Democrats who
voted to shut the chamber's doors, said that the measure was indeed
proving helpful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you about a closed debate,'' Byrd said Tuesday
morning. ``If the Constitutional Convention of 1787 had not closed
its doors, we would not have the Constitution we have today.''
</P>
<P>
   He explained that the Constitution's framers could state a
tentative position without committing to it and could change their
minds later without fear of public scrutiny. They could also speak
bluntly, and he said that that held true when the Senate's doors
closed this time.
</P>
<P>
   A few senators said that many of their colleagues' shoulders
were less rigid, their jaws less tightly set, because there were no
witnesses to their bearings but one another.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said that people moved around more freely, gravitating
toward whoever was speaking, whether the person was in the well or
assigned seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a remarkable thing,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Or, in the words of Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, ``very strange.''

COCA-COLA CITES DROP IN EARNINGS FOR QUARTER AND YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Confirming the bad news it had warned Wall Street about in
December, Coca-Cola Co. reported its fourth-quarter earnings
Tuesday, which showed that the global soft-drink giant suffered
significant declines in volume and revenue in many parts of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Even though much of the damage had been expected, Wall Street
seemed unsettled by the details. Shares of Coca-Cola fell 37.5
cents, to $62.5625, after losing about 3.5 percent at one point
during the day.
</P>
<P>
   Net income fell 27 percent, to $597 million, or 24 cents a
diluted share, compared with $817 million, or 33 cents a share, in
the quarter a year earlier. The earnings were in line with analyst
expectations, which had been revised after a meeting with Coke's
senior managers last month.
</P>
<P>
   Coke's revenue for the quarter was $4.46 billion, down 5 percent
from $4.7 billion. While its costs declined by 11 percent, its
selling, administrative and other expenses rose 7 percent.
Operating income declined by 20 percent, to $937 million from $1.17
billion, and the company posted a $71 million loss in equity
income, largely from the company's selloff of some bottling
operations and losses encountered by some bottlers that it still
owns.
</P>
<P>
   The company's spending on marketing and other expenses rose to
$2.22 billion in the quarter, nearly 50 percent of its revenue.
Case volume sales fell 1 percent worldwide in the quarter, but
individual countries revealed more drastic declines.
</P>
<P>
   Volume dropped 3 percent in Brazil, the company's second-largest
international market, and rose just 1 percent in Japan, the source
of 20 percent of Coke's profits. Volume in Japan for the full year
was flat, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan is crucial to their near-term and long-term outlook,''
said Emanuel Goldman, an analyst for Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., who added
that the situation there remained ``sticky'' for the foreseeable
future.
</P>
<P>
   Volume fell 1 percent in Germany, Coke's fifth-largest market,
in the fourth quarter and was down 2 percent for the year. South
Africa sales fell 14 percent for the quarter because of
deteriorating economic conditions that began with the devaluation
of the rand in May, a Coca-Cola spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The bright spots included the United States, where sales
increased by 5 percent in the quarter; China, where sales grew by
24 percent, and India, which posted growth of 26 percent.
Worldwide, Coca-Cola's volume rose 3 percent for the year, compared
with 10 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings for the full year were $3.5 billion, or $1.42 a share,
compared with $4.1 billion, or $1.64 a share, in 1997. Annual
revenue was $18.81 billion, down slightly from $18.87 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The company's full-year earnings statement highlighted various
bottler acquisitions and investments, including an acquisition in
Russia, the spinoff of Coca-Cola Beverages from Coca-Cola Amatil,
another anchor bottler, and investment in bottling businesses in
India.
</P>
<P>
   Full-year results were affected by the fourth-quarter
performance. In Latin America, volume grew just 7 percent, compared
with 12 percent in 1997. In the Middle East and Southeast Asia,
operating income declined 7 percent for the year, primarily because
of currency devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key driver for 1999 will be how well will key profit
centers like Japan and Germany perform,'' said Andrew Conway, an
analyst for Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter. He expects currencies to
stabilize, which should benefit the company, which he estimates
lost 12 cents a share in earnings for the year because of currency
devaluations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not an awful lot they can do,'' Goldman said.
``Sometimes, they're not the master of their own destiny.''

KING HUSSEIN RETURNS TO US; OLDEST SON IN CHARGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Jordan's cancer-stricken King Hussein has returned
to the United States for emergency medical care, leaving his oldest
son, and newly anointed successor, holding the reins of power in
his absence.
</P>
<P>
   The king's suddenly deteriorating health and rapid departure
Tuesday came only 12 hours after he had stunned Jordan and the
world with the announcement that the throne would not pass to his
brother, Prince Hassan, but to new Crown Prince Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   The developments within the monarchy have reverberated
throughout the Middle East, where the king has come to play an
indispensible role as a strong moral voice and a peace maker with
neighboring Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is made more dramatic by the fact that it comes
just one week after a homecoming in which the nation poured out its
heart to the monarch and celebrated what the palace said was his
``good health'' after six months of cancer treatments in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Upon his return home Jan. 19, Hussein, 63, piloted his own plane
and enthusiastically greeted hundreds of thousands of Jordanians
who lined the streets to welcome him on a raw, rainy day. The
popular monarch, poked his head _ bald from chemotherapy but
wrapped in a red-and-white-checked kaffiyeh _ through a sunroof of
his limo and waved to his subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The gesture was classic Hussein _ warm and vibrant and of the
people. Critics might say it was also characteristically
egotistical. Now, like some tragic Shakespearean figure it could
sadly lead to the undoing of his fragile health.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two hours of driving in the open-topped limousine through
the cold and rain, palace sources fear, brought on the recurrent
fevers and low blood count. His failing condition has concerned
doctors enough to send him back to Minnesota's Mayo Clinic for
tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``His majesty is leaving after suffering from exhaustion,'' a
palace statement said. ``He is going for medical tests.''
</P>
<P>
   His departure came amid palace infighting surrounding his
decision on succession _ made official early Tuesday by royal
decree _ was reportedly intense and at times ugly.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein has ruled over the Hashemite kingdom of Jordan for
nearly a half century, taking the crown at age 17 in 1952 after his
father abdicated due to mental illness and only one year after he
stood next to his grandfather as he was assasinated in Jerusalem.
He is a beloved figure in his country. Eighty percent of Jordanians
have known no other ruler.
</P>
<P>
   The ousting of his younger brother, Prince Hassan, who served as
crown prince and heir to the throne for 34 years, shocked the
nation and caused some concern about the stability of the
monarchical government.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter published in the Jordan Times that did not mince
words, King Hussein publicly rebuked Hassan for meddling in the
army and opposing the king's plans for the succession.
</P>
<P>
   The dismissal of Hassan, who many palace observers say never had
the charisma of his older brother, has given sudden rise to
prominence of the 36-year-old Abdullah, Hussein's oldest son and
the product or his second marriage. Some believed that the crown
would go to Prince Hamzeh, 18, the king's eldest son by his current
wife, the American-born Queen Noor.
</P>
<P>
   But amid the family squabbling it seemed the king deferred to
tradition, opting to pass the crown to his eldest son.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah is a respected senior military officer but a political
novice who inherits the daunting task of guiding a land
precariously positioned between Iraq and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Like his father, Abdullah is considered down-to-earth and
trusted by the leaders of the Bedouin clans _ unlike Hassan, who
was viewed as too erudite and arrogant.
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage for Abdullah is his marriage to a Palestinian
woman. This, palace watchers believe, will put him in good standing
with the majority of Jordan's population _ Palestinian refugees
displaced from the West Bank and welcomed on the other side of the
Jordan River after the Arab-Israeli wars of 1948 and 1967.
</P>
<P>
   He will need all of the support he can get as he faces the
challenges of balancing a growing income gap and a potentially
restive underclass in a land with few natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   But by far the most difficult _ and crucial _ issue the Crown
Prince will face is preserving the tenuous 1994 peace accord with
Israel. King Hussein was given time by his people to give peace a
chance, analysts say; it is unclear that his successor will be
afforded that luxury.

LITTLE DABS FROM 25,297 TEXANS DOT DIORAMA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY BINGHAM 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Only in Texas ... will you find the nation's
largest paint-by-numbers picture.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Brenham artist Jim Campbell brings to Fort Worth his
48-foot-long diorama painted by _ hold your breath _ 25,297 Texans,
including 1,362 from Fort Worth-Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Y'all take a moment and pat y'allselves on the back.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, it's really impressive that that many people did
such a good job,'' Campbell said. The painting, ``A Little Dab of
Texas,'' is on display starting Tuesday at Suitable for Framing in
west Fort Worth. The exhibit ends Saturday with a reception for
Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   The painting was Campbell's idea, so the cowboys, longhorns, log
cabins and wagons are his drawings. The roadrunner, rattler, wild
pig and cows he hid in the collage are his, too. The vibrant
purple, yellow, orange and turquoise colors are his take on the Old
West.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, who is a contemporary western artist, was looking for
publicity. He hauled his 12 panels to more than 80 locations
statewide, from a Victoria rodeo to a ranch outside Weatherford,
from a Dallas Texaco station to Arbor Day in Euless.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the 12 pieces of wood is a stand-alone picture that
measures 4 feet by 8 feet. When put together, they form the
diorama. Campbell drew them in pencil, then asked his amateur
artists to match color paint to the small dots of color he used to
code his drawings. He went through a surprisingly small amount of
paint: six gallons.
</P>
<P>
   The project took him three years and four months, but now that
it's done, it will be displayed in 30 Texas cities. It has already
been on display in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Look closely, and you can see where some painters took artistic
license. One wise guy painted a cream-colored shingle green;
another gave a longhorn steer a smile, a pair of eyelashes and a
brand shaped like the state itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knew I hid stuff, so the people who painted got back
at me and they started hiding things in the painting themselves,''
Campbell said. He painted over any initials, names or slogans he
found. But he's still finding dots turned into hearts, hands bigger
than he drew them, and other surprises.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest Texan to paint was 14 days old; the oldest 92
years. One boy spit in his paint to make it go further, and one
cowboy dipped his brush in a can of Bud Light for the same reason.
It's rumored that a wiener dog in Abilene took some strokes, but
Campbell didn't count him.
</P>
<P>
   No telling what he hid in the painting.
</P>
<P>

   WASHINGTON _ A federal appeals court handed a victory to
independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr Tuesday, reinstating a tax
evasion case against former Associate Attorney General Webster
Hubbell. But the court also raised questions about the way Starr
handled the case, suggesting it may be difficult to successfully
prosecute the charges.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate impact of the decision is that Hubbell, a former
mayor of Little Rock, Ark., and one of President Clinton's closest
friends, now faces a criminal trial on charges that he evaded
taxes. The case also is significant because it may prompt Starr to
delve once again into the Whitewater matter, which has dogged the
president for years.
</P>
<P>
   But the 2-1 ruling by the US Court of Appeals in the District of
Columbia contained enough questions about Starr's treatment of the
case that the Hubbell legal team wound up praising part of the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell attorney John Nields said he is ``very gratified'' that
the court questioned whether Starr violated Hubbell's Fifth
Amendment rights by relying on documents provided by Hubbell under
a limited grant of immunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides have something to cheer about,'' said former
federal prosecutor Robert Ullmann of Boston, noting that the
reinstatement of the case is tempered by questions about whether
key evidence will be deemed admissable.
</P>
<P>
   The Hubbell case is being closely watched in Washington because
Starr has suggested that Hubbell knows more about Clinton's
involvement in the Whitewater land development project than he has
said. Hubbell, in turn, has said Starr brought the case against him
in an effort to intimidate him into lying about the president and
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're innocent, not only myself but my wife and my friends of
any of the underlying charges,'' Hubbell said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling overturns a decision last July by US District Judge
James Robertson that resulted in the tax case being thrown out.
Robertson ruled that Starr violated Hubbell's Fifth Amendment
rights by basing the tax case on records supplied by Hubbell under
a grant of limited immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the appeals court said that while Starr's case against
Hubbell may be sound, Starr's methods may be questionable.
</P>
<P>
   The case may be sound, the court said, because it is
``reasonable'' for Starr to theorize that Hubbell was paid hundreds
of thousands of dollars in ``hush money'' from Clinton friends who
wanted to ensure that Hubbell wouldn't talk about the president's
involvement in Whitewater.
</P>
<P>
   But the court questioned whether Starr based his case on records
that Hubbell supplied under the limited immunity grant. Those
documents included 13,120 pages of Hubbell's financial records.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave me immunity to get the documents and then they used
those documents to later indict,'' Hubbell said Tuesday. ``That's
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In the tax case, Starr alleged that Hubbell owes about $900,000
in taxes and penalties. Starr also alleged that Hubbell performed
little or no work for hundreds of thousands of dollars in
consulting fees, much of it from Clinton friends.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court Tuesday did not rule on whether the payments
were intended to keep Hubbell quiet, but said the theory is
sufficient reason to bring the case against Hubbell. ``The timing,
sources, and extent of the payments make the belief that they were
hush money reasonable,'' the ruling said.
</P>
<P>
   But the appeals court warned Starr that he must show he learned
about the key facts of the case without relying on the documents
provided by Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government labors under `a heavy burden of proving that
all evidence it seeks to introduce is untainted by the immunized
act of production,' '' the court said, quoting a prior case.
``Accordingly, should the Independent Counsel prove unable to meet
the requisite evidentiary burden, the contents of those documents
will be inadmissible.''
</P>
<P>
   That raised comparisons to the way the former White House aide,
Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North, initially was found guilty in the
Iran-contra affair, but then had the verdict overturned after a
federal appeals ruled he was improperly convicted partly on the
basis of testimony he provided under a congressional grant of
immunity.

CLINTON TO SEEK HALT OF `BIOINVASION' IN US HARBORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ As soon as next week, President Clinton will
order federal agencies to escalate efforts to slow a so-called
``bioinvasion'' of American harbors by shellfish, crabs and other
creatures arriving on barges and ocean freighters, Interior
Secretary Bruce Babbitt announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, as global trade has exploded, shipping has led
to the spread of hundreds of species outside their home habitat.
Some arrivals threaten to become marine versions of gypsy moths or
kudzu, pests wreaking ecological havoc on US harbor life.
</P>
<P>
   In the Great Lakes, for example, the zebra mussel, which
apparently arrived in this country from Europe 11 years ago, now
breeds so abundantly it clogs up intake pipes for water works and
power plants and is blamed for making Chicago's water smelly in
summer. The mussel has spread down the Mississippi River and
several tributaries as far south as New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   A Japanese whelk is beginning to devastate oyster beds in
Maryland's Chesapeake bay, marine authorities say. Virulent Third
World strains of cholera have shown up in some Gulf Coast waters.
As many as 4 of 10 species found in Pacific Northwest harbors and
estuaries are foreign invaders.
</P>
<P>
   And the United States is not only on the receiving end: The
Atlantic comb jelly, a phosphorescent jellyfish that Cape Cod
beachwalkers stir up at dusk, has devastated anchovy fisheries in
the Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
   At a first-of-its-kind global conference on strategies to fight
marine bioinvasion, held at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, Babbitt told 250 scientists and researchers that
Clinton will issue an executive order soon ordering federal
agencies to collaborate on stopping the plague.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to find some sort of approach that is more
comprehensive,'' Babbitt said, adding that Clinton's executive
order will come ``very shortly.''
</P>
<P>
   Every year, according to an Australian researcher, Geoff R.
Rigby, 10 billion tons of sea water are transferred around the
Earth, used as ballast for 29,000 large merchant vessels and naval
fleets.
</P>
<P>
   Several strategies could slow the spread of harmful exotic
species, but all would create cost and inconvenience for shippers.
</P>
<P>
   Examples include requiring ships to dump or flush out their
ballast holds 200 miles offshore where invasive exotics would
likely die, or using ship engine waste heat, filters or ultraviolet
devices to kill exotics before discharging ballast water in foreign
ports.
</P>
<P>
   Many conference participants, including Craig N. Johnston of the
Lewis and Clark Law School in Oregon, say that ballast water and
pollutants should be regulated under the existing Clean Water Act.
Babbitt called that ``an idea that ought to be discussed. It has
some obvious benefits and some obvious problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever regulators advise, Babbitt predicted, ``We'll hear a
lot of squawking, a lot of squawking'' from shipping groups, port
authorities and regulators faced with enforcing the law.
</P>
<P>
   James T. Carlton, director of the Williams College Maritime
Studies Program at Mystic Seaport, Conn., said, ``The science of
marine invasions is no more than 10 years old, but huge demands are
placed on it to be robustly predictive.''
</P>
<P>
   However, data are so scarce that ``we suffer from a Swiss-cheese
view of invasion ecology, with far too many holes to produce broad,
compelling predictions'' or guidance on effective solutions,
Carlton said.
</P>
<P>
   It could be years or decades before it becomes apparent which of
the hundreds of bioinvaders prove problematic. But Chris Bright of
the Worldwatch Institute, author of a book on the subject, argued
that ``bioinvasion may already rank just behind habitat loss'' as a
trigger for extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past century, Bright said, exotic species have played a
role in 68 percent of US fish extinctions.

   WASHINGTON _ Declining to wait for a Senate subpoena, Monica S.
Lewinsky checked out of the Mayflower Hotel here Tuesday and
returned home to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   While House managers argued for the necessity of calling her as
a witness, Ms. Lewinsky, 25, hurried past a phalanx of reporters
and TV cameras that had been parked outside the hotel since her
arrival on Saturday and stepped into a limousine.
</P>
<P>
   Her lawyer, Plato Cacheris, said that the former White House
intern wanted to get out of town. ``She's been cooped up in the
hotel,'' Cacheris said. ``She wants to get on with her life.''
</P>
<P>
   For the third consecutive day, Cacheris announced that Ms.
Lewinsky had absolutely no interest in testifying at the Senate
impeachment trial of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   It took a court order to summon Ms. Lewinsky to Washington on
Saturday. And it would take a Senate subpoena to bring her back
over the next few days, her lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she's needed, if they issue a proper document to get her
back here, she will return,'' Cacheris said.

SOUTH AFRICA'S ELECTIONS CHIEF ABRUPTLY QUITS
</HEADLINE>
 (bl)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ After months of fighting over the
way South Africa's second post-apartheid election should be run,
the chairman of the country's Independent Election Commission
resigned suddenly Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman, Johann Kriegler, had repeatedly complained of a
lack of financing for his agency and criticized the government's
decision to require voters to get new identity documents before
registering.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts believe that the identity document decision could
discourage millions from voting _ particularly whites and those in
deep rural areas _ and cause other problems as well. Two opposition
parties are challenging the rule in court.
</P>
<P>
   Only last month, Kriegler warned of ``the ominous specter of
tens of thousands of black youths arriving at voting stations on
election day _ but having to be turned away'' because of the
government insistence on new bar-coded identification books.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1994 elections, voters had only to go to the polls
carrying identification. But this time the country is trying to
enforce stricter controls.
</P>
<P>
   The voter registration process has, however, been plagued with
difficulties and Kriegler's departure just months before the
election is due only increased the fear here that the vote could be
delayed.
</P>
<P>
   According to South Africa's constitution, elections must be held
before the end of July, but the vote has been expected in May or
June. The constitution also says that President Nelson Mandela can
fix the date only after Parliament has adjourned, probably at the
end of March.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela announced Kriegler's resignation at a hastily convened
news conference at his home here. He did not say why Kriegler had
resigned, but denied it had to do with a shortage of financing or
the new registration procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was with great regret that I accepted the resignation today
of Judge Johann Kriegler as commissioner and as chairperson of the
IEC,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kriegler, 66, is an outspoken and independent-minded man who
guided the nation through its first free election in 1994, which
ended white minority rule and put the African National Congress in
control of the government.
</P>
<P>
   After Mandela's announcement, Kriegler held his own news
conference and rejected the idea that his departure could delay the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had found ``the load'' of being both the chairman of
the commission and a member of the nation's highest court, the
Constitutional Court, ``increasingly heavy.'' At the same time, he
said, ``persisting differences of opinion about the role and
function of the commission'' had added to the burden.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to enumerate his differences with the Mandela
administration, saying: ``You know what they are. They have been
reported. It would be unfair of me to highlight any one now.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandela said he had appointed Kriegler's deputy, Brigalia Bam,
to replace him in the interim.
</P>
<P>
   Kriegler first threatened to resign last July if the agency did
not get more financing to conduct the elections. It received about
$90 million, about half the amount requested. Instead, it abandoned
its voter education efforts and then drastically curtailed its
registration drives. Only after a public uproar did the government
make army personnel available to help.
</P>
<P>
   Kriegler has also repeatedly objected to the government's
insistence on the bar-coded identification books, a requirement
that is expected to hurt the opposition parties. Three parties, two
largely supported by whites and the Inkatha Freedom Party, the
country's second-largest black party, have called on the government
to revoke the requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Inkatha was particularly concerned that its rural supporters
would have a hard time getting the new identification.
</P>
<P>
   The rule is also likely to affect white voters. While blacks
were quick to get rid of the apartheid-era documents, many whites
have not.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Searching for a graceful ending to the impeachment
trial, Sen. Trent Lott, the Republican leader, on Tuesday named a
six-senator working group to examine how the Senate could vote to
express its view that President Clinton committed perjury and
obstruction of justice without removing him from office.
</P>
<P>
   Lott's problem is one of numbers: A majority of senators _ most
Republicans and possibly some Democrats _ believe that the
president committed the offenses described in the articles of
impeachment, and they do not want to end the trial with only a vote
to acquit. But far fewer than the two-thirds of senators required
by the Constitution are prepared to vote the president out of
office.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, opinion polls show that most people agree that
Clinton is culpable but do not want him expelled from office.
</P>
<P>
   The latest device under consideration by the senators would be a
preliminary vote on ``findings of fact,'' in which senators could
affirm the truth of the charges in the articles of impeachment.
Presumably a majority would vote in favor.
</P>
<P>
   A second vote would then be taken on removing the president from
office. Presumably it would fail for lack of a two-thirds majority.
</P>
<P>
   This seems to pass constitutional muster. The first vote would
be like a sense of the Senate resolution and would not involve
punishment. In many respects, it would be hardly different from the
censure resolution that some Democrats have advocated as an
alternative to impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, some senators considered a constitutional
interpretation advanced by Joseph Isenbergh of the University of
Chicago Law School that while the Constitution requires removal for
conviction of high crimes and misdemeanors, it permits lesser
punishment for impeachment for lesser offenses. Under that
interpretation, the Senate could vote to convict Clinton but then
vote to allow him to stay in office.
</P>
<P>
   But few authorities on the Constitution agree with Isenbergh,
and his proposal has basically been set aside. Sen. Olympia Snowe
of Maine, co-chairwoman of Lott's working group, said she had been
advised by the Senate legal counsel, Thomas Griffith, that the
Senate could not vote to convict Clinton without removing him from
office.
</P>
<P>
   Laurence Tribe, a constitutional law professor at Harvard Law
School, said in an interview that conviction required removal from
office and that the Isenbergh approach was clearly
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   But Tribe said it would be perfectly permissible for the Senate
to vote to express its official opinion that the president had
committed the offenses with which he was charged but to forgo
conviction on the ground that the offenses were not the high crimes
necessary for removal from offices.
</P>
<P>
   In three instances in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the
Senate voted to convict judges and then took separate votes to
remove them from office. But authorities who have reviewed the
records say there was never any thought that those judges could
remain in office once they were convicted of the articles of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The working grou named by Lott consists entirely of
Republicans. In addition to Snowe, the members are Sen. Pete
Domenici of New Mexico, the co-chairman, and Sens. John Ashcroft of
Missouri, Susan Collins of Maine, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and
John Warner of Virginia.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In an interview on Sunday on the CBS News program ``Face the
Nation,'' Collins said that a separate vote on the facts would
``give a lot of senators who are very concerned about the
president's actions, who believe that he did commit obstruction of
justice, for example, the opportunity to distinguish between those
offenses and the question of removal.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats might oppose a preliminary vote on findings of
fact. Many Democrats want the Senate to acquit Clinton of the
impeachment charges first and end the trial. They have said they
would then be receptive to a resolution to reprimand or censure the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Senate's rules, the findings of fact could be brought
up by a majority vote, and it would require only a majority to
approve the measure. Republicans, who have a 55-45 seat advantage
over Democrats, presumably could assemble a majority for the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   But if it passed on a party-line vote, Clinton and his
Democratic allies could continue to argue that impeachment was no
more than a partisan drive by Republicans against a popular
Democratic president.

ALTAVISTA TO BECOME COMPAQ SUBSIDIARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a time when leading Internet search services have run up
stock market valuations in the billions, Compaq Computer Corp.'s
AltaVista site has remained on the sidelines _ until now.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq Tuesday said it will turn AltaVista into a wholly owned
subsidiary and offer shares of AltaVista to the public, possibly by
year end. The new company will also seek major strategic
investments from other firms, although Compaq says it will remain
the majority owner.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq hopes to benefit from the dramatic run-up in Internet
stocks, and the eagerness of major media companies to make large
investments in Internet firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to be a multibillion revenue company by the end of
the year 2002,'' said Rod Schrock, the president and chief
executive of Palo Alto, Calif-based AltaVista Co., and former
Compaq senior vice president of consumer products. Schrock expects
to achieve most of this growth through sales of merchandise at the
AltaVista site. Compaq recently acquired the Internet shopping
company Shopping.com, and this service will be added to the
AltaVista site.
</P>
<P>
   Many other Internet search services, like Waltham-based Lycos
Inc. are transforming themselves into ``portal sites,'' which offer
a wide range of features intended to keep visitors at the site for
as long as possible.
</P>
<P>
   But Schrock said AltaVista will get visitors in and out quickly
by providing the fastest Internet search service available.
Visitors will spend less time at the site, Schrock said, but he
believes that faster searches will make them visit more often. In
addition, Schrock aims to make the AltaVista shopping experience as
fast and simple as possible.
</P>
<P>
   AltaVista was created in 1995 by Digital Equipment Corp., which
was purchased by Compaq last year. AltaVista was started to
demonstrate the speed of computers that used Digital's powerful
Alpha microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   But the site soon became far more than a marketing gimmick,
establishing itself as one of the Internet's most popular search
services.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it never achieved the popularity of other Internet
services like Yahoo. And as part of a larger company, AltaVista
couldn't take advantage of the soaring stock valuations of rival
Internet firms. ``It's sort of like locking up your prettiest
daughter,'' said Melissa Bane, analyst for the Yankee Group in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   AltaVista ranked number twelve among Web sites last month,
lagging Yahoo, Excite, Lycos and other top destinations, according
to the Media Metrix research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Digital planned to spin off AltaVista back in 1996, but later
shelved the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Paris Burstyn, an Internet watcher with International Data Corp.
in Framingham, Mass., said Compaq could earn back a large chunk of
the $9.6 billion it paid for Digital simply by selling a piece of
the new AltaVista unit.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Burstyn noted the deal could resolve an awkward
conflict of interest problem. Compaq hopes to sell computers to
other Internet companies, but they might hesitate to buy while
Compaq also runs a rival Internet service. ``Compaq wants a big
piece of this market,'' Burstyn said, ``and it doesn't want to give
the appearance of AltaVista competing with its customers.''
</P>
<P>
   In a related development, Compaq struck a deal with Microsoft
Corp. to license Microsoft's Hotmail technology to provide free
electronic mail services on the AltaVista site. At the same time,
Microsoft agreed to use AltaVista as the primary search service on
Microsoft's MSN Web site. Microsoft will terminate its existing
agreement to use a search engine created by Inktomi Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq closed at 49 1/4, up 2 9/16 on the New York Stock
Exchange.

Opera season a mixture of revival, novelty By Sharon Cotal, Daily News Staff Writer 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peter Hemmings, general director of the Los Angeles Opera,
announced Monday that the 1999-2000 opera season will include
revivals of old favorites as well as two new productions never
before staged in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Hemmings will retire at the end of the season after 14 years
with the opera. He will be succeeded by star tenor Placido Domingo,
who will assume the role of artistic director in July 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Hemmings cites the critically acclaimed Francesca Zambello
production of Benjamin Britten's ``Billy Budd'' as one of the
season's highlights. The all-male cast features baritone Rodney
Gilfry as Billy and bass Jeffrey Wells as Claggart, the
master-at-arms maddened by Billy Budd's goodness and beauty.
Loosely based on the Shakespeare characters, ``The Capulets and the
Montagues'' which is also new to L.A., will premiere in October.
</P>
<P>
   Domingo will appear in the opera's first performance of the
French masterpiece ``Samson et Dalila'' in September. He will be
accompanied by mezzo-soprano Denyce Graves in the role of the
Philistine temptress.

Kiri Te Kanawa in a solo recital on Nov. 3.

US-RUSSIA RELATIONS FROSTY AFTER ALBRIGHT VISIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Alexander Shokhin is not your average knee-jerk
anti-American. A moderate politician who has been associated with
Russia's pro-Western governments in the past, Shokhin occasionally
can be found at receptions at the US embassy in Moscow, trading
jokes in English with Americans.
</P>
<P>
   To get an idea of the state of US-Russian relations as Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright ended a 48-hour visit here Tuesday,
consider Shokhin's reaction to reports of an American missile
attack against Iraq Monday that Baghdad says killed innocent
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a US attempt to put pressure on Russia,'' Ekho Moskvy
radio quoted Shokhin as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Misgivings and mistrust were the rule among Russian commentators
on Albright's visit, which came at a time when the United States
and Russia agree on little and relations are as cool as they have
been since the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Russia differ on how to deal with Iraq and
Kosovo. The United States accuses Russia of secretly helping Iraq
develop its missile program; Russia is upset over an American plan
to build a new anti-missile defense system that it says would
scuttle a fundamental arms control treaty. As a result, Russia says
it will not ratify the 1993 START 2 treaty on reducing nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Russia needs cash. The United States thinks Russia needs a
clearer economic plan if it expects financial aid.
</P>
<P>
   But what really irks Russians is the thought that the United
States is exploiting Russia's current weakness.
</P>
<P>
   ``America should not demonstrate that it is much stronger and
that it can order Russia around,'' said Mintemir Shaimiyev,
governor of the Volga region of Tatarstan. ``We remember all those
years when the Soviet Union was the equal of the United
States....This is not popular among Russians.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright and Ivanov Tuesday promised to keep the vital
relationship between the world's two nuclear superpowers on track.
However, Albright exchanged verbal blows with two men with good
chances to become Russia's next president, Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov and Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov.
</P>
<P>
   She also heard criticism from President Boris N. Yeltsin.
Hospitalized with a bleeding ulcer, Yeltsin voiced concern about
the missile-defense question and told Albright that unilateral US
military action in Iraq or Kosovo ``is impermissible,'' according
to his press service.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's words were overshadowed at home by reports suggesting
that Primakov was negotiating with the Russian parliament to
undermine the ailing Russian leader's authority. Both Primakov and
Yeltsin's chief of administration denied the reports, although
Yeltsin issued a statement expressing his disdain for attempts to
pry away his powers.
</P>
<P>
   Albright and Ivanov did issue a joint statement condemning the
masscre of 40 villagers in Kosovo. They also signed an agreement
that Albright said would allow the United States to resume
cooperation with Russia over the launching of satellites.
</P>
<P>
   But Albright said the deal depended on Russia's ability to halt
its support of Iran's missile program. Ivanov protested what he
called attempts to ``pressure'' Russia. He was referring to the
sanctions Washington imposed on three Russian research institutes
this month for allegedly aiding Iran. Russia says the aid never
happened and the sanctions are humiliating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sanctions against Russian institutions is a slap in the
face,'' said Alexei Venediktov, news editor of Ekho Moskvy.
``Research institutes, this is a blow against Russian science ,
something we are proud of. The Americans are not paying attention
to us, and that hurts.''

A MEETING OF CONTRASTS AS PRESIDENT GREETS POPE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KIM COBB 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Pope John Paul II's meeting with President Clinton
on Tuesday presented a stark contrast between the world's most
popular spiritual leader and this country's most visible,
self-described sinner.
</P>
<P>
   A cross section of Catholic leaders had said they would not
expect John Paul to use his brief visit to the United States to
chastise Clinton. The consensus was that the pope is far too savvy
a politician for that.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Michael Miller, president of the University of St.
Thomas in Houston, said the pope tends to criticize systems, not
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really not his style to address something which could so
quickly be turned to partisan use,'' Miller added.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, a Southern Baptist, greeted the pontiff warmly upon his
arrival at the St. Louis airport. A few minutes later the pope
referred to ``times of trial, tests of national character'' and
challenged Americans to reach for a higher moral vision.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the same Catholics who say they don't think the
country needs spiritual healing in the wake of the president's sex
scandal and subsequent impeachment concede they would like to hear
what John Paul has to say on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is known for his ability to ``compartmentalize'' his
thoughts and feelings about one issue while he tackles another.
</P>
<P>
   So apparently too are American Catholics, who are celebrating
the pope's visit even during this current period of political
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't hear the kids talk about the president, but they get
pumped up about a 78-year-old man,'' said Mary Thole, youth adviser
to a group of Catholic teen-agers from Highland, Ill., attending
Tuesday's rally and prayer service.
</P>
<P>
   In his last visit to the United States in 1995, John Paul chided
Americans repeatedly for public and private immorality. His
frequent message, particularly to young people, is that a
permissive morality reduces freedom to a license to do as one
pleases.
</P>
<P>
   But even as sociologists talk about a deep distrust of rigid
authority among Americans born after World War II, the most
prosperous religious communities tend to be more rule-oriented than
others, said one expert on popular religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody's going to benefit (from Clinton's problems) it's
maybe that the religious leadership goes up in public esteem _
people you look up to for moral leadership,'' said Charles Howard
Lippy, Martin Professor of religious studies at the University of
Tennessee at Chattanooga.
</P>
<P>
   But Howard noted that ``the religious world'' has suffered under
its own share of sex scandals in recent years, including those of
Catholic priests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're discovering that clergy are no different than
other folks,'' Lippy said. ``We all have problems when those people
get caught.''
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Oksiupa, a student at St. Louis University, said, ``I
guess I hope he'd be addressing some of (the President's) problems.
I'd actually like to hear what (the pope) would say about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Oksiupa, 19, said she expects the pope's visit to be
overshadowed by public interest in Clinton's trial before the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   And some Catholics confessed that they'd would have liked to be
the proverbial ``fly on the wall'' when the president met privately
with the pope if the two discussed Clinton's trangressions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard a lot of people talk about the dichotomy of the
president talking to the pope,'' said St. Louis resident Frank
Fick. ``It's an interesting transposition of values.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if the president brought it up, but I
wouldn't expect the pope to,'' Fick said.
</P>
<P>
   The world leaders met privately for about 20 minutes. Their
respective press aides said Clinton and the pope talked about
challenges to peace and justice around the world, religious
freedom, and the pope's hope that the value of human beings will be
defended and protected in all circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The pope told the president that Clinton and all the other U.S.
leaders were in his prayers.

POPE CHALLENGES AMERICANS TO RAISE MORAL STANDARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Journeying to America's heartland amid a wrenching
national political and moral debate, Pope John Paul II met
President Clinton Tuesday and challenged all Americans to ``a
higher moral vision.''
</P>
<P>
   In public remarks, John Paul made no direct reference to
President Clinton's fight for his political life as the Senate
continues its impeachment proceedings, but he did say that
``America faces a time of trial'' and a test of national character.
</P>
<P>
   While praising the United States for advancing the cause of
freedom in the world, John Paul chastized America for being
indifferent to the plight of society's weakest _ the poor, the
unborn and minorities and he exhorted the country to ``reaffirm the
genuine truths and values of the American experience.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of his strongest statements on one of the most explosive
issues roiling the United States, the pope compared the aborting of
babies to last century's infamous Dred Scott case, argued in St.
Louis, that declared slaves to be private property.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the pope said, ``after untold sufferring and with
enormous effort,'' the struggle by blacks to win their legal rights
has been largely successful.
</P>
<P>
   But the conflict, John Paul added, now is ``between a culture
that affirms, cherishes, and celibrates the gift of life, and a
culture that seeks to declare entire groups of human beings _ the
unborn, the terminally ill, the handicapped, and others considered
`unuseful' _ to be outside the boundaries of legal protection.''
</P>
<P>
   US Catholic leaders have been outspoken in their support of
legislation that would outlaw late-term abortions, a controversial
procedure that has become one of the newest and hottest
battlegrounds in the national abortion debate.
</P>
<P>
   In a private 20-minute meeting between Clinton and the pope,
abortion only ``came up in passing'' and the Monica Lewinsky affair
not at all, White House officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Lewinsky) topic was not included,'' agreed Vatican
spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls. The Vatican media have given scant
attention to the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The two men did talk about Cuba and Iraq, Navarro-Valls said,
two areas on which Clinton and the pontiff disagree. The pope
strongly opposes the US economic embargo against Cuba and Iraq,
arguing that it punishes children, the sick and the poor. On
Monday, the Vatican harshly criticized the United States latest air
strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq was a topic of conversation for a while, but the
positions on both sides were so clear that a real dialogue did not
develop,'' Navarro-Valls said.
</P>
<P>
   Inside an Air National Guard hangar at Lambert-St. Louis
International Airport, where a crowd of 2,500 had been waiting, the
pope received a much more boisterous welcome than Clinton, who was
accompanied by his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   During his speech, Clinton hailed John Paul for his role in
bringing down Communism but said that ``people still need to hear
your message that all are God's children, all have fallen short of
his glory. All of the injustices of yesterday cannot excuse a
single injustice today.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope arrived after a triumphant five-day visit to Mexico,
where he delivered a blueprint for the future of the church in the
Americas.
</P>
<P>
   On his seventh visit to US soil, John Paul was expected to
exhort his flock, particularly young Catholics, to build a more
moral and just society as the church prepares to enter the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   He called on America to ``open wide your hearts to the ever
increasing plight and urgent needs of our less fortunate brothers
and sisters throughout the world.''
</P>
<P>
   John Paul's first major event Tuesday was a raucous rally with
20,000 young people, giving the pontiff the chance to celebrate
with a demographic group he has particular affection for and from
which he always receives a strong spiritual boost.
</P>
<P>
   Showing he was in touch with youth culture, John Paul referred
to last year's record-breaking baseball season much to the delight
of the teens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am told that there was much excitement in St. Louis during
the recent baseball season, when two great players (Mark McGwire
and Sammy Sosa), were competing to break the home-run record,'' the
pope said. ``You can feel the same great enthusiasm as you train
for a different goal: the goal of following Christ, the goal of
bringing his message to the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the youths had traveled for hours from Ohio, Illinois,
Kentucky and other states to cheer on one of the world's most
admired men.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most awesome thing I've ever been to,'' said Chris
Nelson, 15, who with about 40 classmates rode a bus for four hours
from Notre Dame High School in Peoria, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   For small Midwestern city on the banks of the Mississippi River,
built by French Catholics, the visit of the leader of the world's 1
billion Roman Catholics is one of the biggest events in its,
bringing to St. Louis unprecedented international media attention.
</P>
<P>
   The pope literally brought the city to a standstill as downtown
streets were closed and many people sneaked out of work to get a
peep at John Paul as he rode by in his now-familiar ``popemobile.''
</P>
<P>
   About 1 million people, the biggest crowd St. Louis has drawn
since the 1904 world's fair, are expected to flood the city for the
30-hour papal visit.
</P>
<P>
   Banners, some in Polish, welcoming the pontiff were hung across
the city, from hotels, apartment buildings and pawnshops. One rock
'n roll station took advantage of the visit to depict the pope on a
billboard wearing headphones. The caption read: ``Father Knows
Best.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an incredible honor for this city and a wonderful
opportunity for it to shine,'' said Alex Volansky. ``It's all
anybody has been talking about for weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Volansky, along with his 20-year-old daughter, Julie, was won a
ticket to attend the welcoming ceremony inside the Missouri
National Guard hangar and rub shoulders with politicians, diplomats
and church leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The trip here, which culminates Wednesday with a Mass for over
100,000 people inside the TWA Dome, is a tip of the pope's skullcap
to John Paul's close friend, St. Louis Archbishop Justin Rigali,
who worked in the Vatican for many years and was a key adviser to
the pontiff during the early years of his 20-year pontificate.

L.A.'S LEADING DOOMSAYER IGNORES CRITICS (AND, SOME SAY, THE

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On a winter Sunday morning of the sort that only
Southern California seems to produce, under a brilliant blue sky
scoured clean of clouds and smog, a crowd of upper-middle-class
Angelenos filed into the Skirball Cultural Center and plunked down
$10 each to hear a conversation with their city's reigning prophet
of doom.
</P>
<P>
   In two best-selling books, ``City of Quartz'' published in 1990,
and ``Ecology of Fear,'' issued last fall, that man, Mike Davis,
has portrayed Los Angeles as a false paradise ruled by malign
elites who have stifled the poor, built a fortress downtown
surrounded by a growing ring of dying suburbs, and courted
environmental disaster by heedlessly encroaching on canyons and
cliffsides never meant for mass habitation.
</P>
<P>
   For this Davis, a one-time meat-cutter and now full-time Marxist
urbanologist, has been hailed as something like a hero, not only by
the coast-to-coast school of critics who have long looked askance
Los Angeles, but by his fellow Southern Californians whose
unrelenting misery he presumes to celebrate. The winner of a
$315,000 MacArthur Foundation ``genius'' grant, he has also won an
unquestioned place on the short list of serious thinkers about a
city whose prevailing culture has long been a blend of oligarchical
boosterism and noir self-loathing.
</P>
<P>
   When a questioner at the Skirball Center gestured to the sunny
splendor of the Sepulveda Pass outside and asked if L.A. was really
so bad, Davis, 52, acknowledged with a rueful laugh, ``I wake up in
the morning and look at the San Gabriel Mountains in incredible
January _ even if it may be a symptom of global warming _ and I ask
myself, `Are you crazy?'''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, a growing chorus of Californians is
effectively answering, ``Yes!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ecology of Fear'' (Metropolitan Books), with its thesis that
the modern megalopolis of L.A. has no business existing in the
earthquake-ridden Southern California desert, has unleashed a
pent-up firestorm of criticism over Davis' methods after 16 weeks
on the local best-seller list (``City of Quartz'' is No. 5 on the
paperback list).
</P>
<P>
   Critics have cast grave doubt on many of the obscure and
startling factoids that are Davis' stock-in-trade, calling into
question his broader argument that Los Angeles is a hopelessly
damned creature of unchecked real estate speculation and the
mercenary folly of its ruling class.
</P>
<P>
   The debate has pitted rival camps of the city's interpreters
against each other in a fight more typical of New York or Paris
than of laid-back L.A. Academics, alternative weeklies, business
journals and The Los Angeles Times have all weighed in, with
everything from Davis' birthplace (the desert suburb of Fontana,
not Los Angeles, as the book jacket of ``Ecology'' says) to his
marriages (he is on his fifth) grist for the mill. As a topic of
collective conversation, he is not quite on a par with the Dodgers
or the latest movie grosses, but he is gaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, it is a significant development in the
intellectual history of Los Angeles _ and don't gasp, there is such
a thing,'' said Kevin Starr, the state librarian whose own
histories of the Golden State, like ``Inventing the Dream,'' have
been hailed as authoritative. ``The decade of the 90s began with
`City of Quartz' and its elegantly presented noir vision of Los
Angeles as a repressive conspiracy, and sure enough, all these noir
aspects came out, beginning with the riots in '92.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the decade,'' Starr continued, ``there's a
different situation. Immigrant groups have revitalized the Los
Angeles economy, the mood is better, and here comes a book that
really makes us think about earthquakes and the epicycle of
climatological reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Davis' offering of an unmitigatedly apocalyptic point of view
is now meeting with resistance. There's going to be some bad
manners, some fighting back and forth. But you've got people caring
about L.A. and the theory of L.A., and I think that's very
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, whose unruly shock of white hair and soft, half-swallowed
speaking voice convey an aura about as threatening as Linus in
``Peanuts,'' has been caught in some embarrassing mistakes. For
starters, he has acknowledged fabricating an entire conversation
with a local environmentalist, Lewis McAdams, for a cover story he
wrote for the L.A. Weekly a decade ago; he defends it as an early
attempt at journalistic scene-setting.
</P>
<P>
   In ``City of Quartz,'' discussing the power divisions between
the city's old and new elites, he misidentified the late Howard
Ahmanson, the founder of the giant Home Savings empire and a
conservative Christian, as Jewish, and he also described Hancock
Park, one of the city's oldest WASP enclaves, as a Jewish
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   He also acknowledges that he cannot find the source for his
claim in ``Ecology of Fear'' that as many as 30 bodies a year have
been found in drug-plagued MacArthur Park near downtown, a claim
the police dismiss as wildly off-base.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book is a, you know, polemic, with a lot of irony and
humor in it,'' Davis said in a two-hour interview at a pub near his
home in Pasadena. ``It has sailed over the heads of some people.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel Kotkin, a fellow at the Pepperdine Institute for Public
Policy in Malibu and one of Davis' most vociferous critics, said
that he welcomes a debate over the meaning of Los Angeles, but that
Davis has so twisted the facts as to make honest debate impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The latest critique of Davis, for example, in the weekly New
Times L.A., leaves little doubt that the portrait of suburban
Pomona, as described in ``Ecology of Fear,'' as a deserted husk is
at best outdated, ignoring a decade of revival.
</P>
<P>
   ``What bothers me even as a person who was trained as a Marxist
is that somebody would so bastardize Marxist theory to the point of
making things up,'' Kotkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' particular calling card has been his unearthing of
obscure, even fantastic, facts about Los Angeles' experience with
natural and scientific phenomena, from monsoon-intensity rain to
little-noticed tornados to mountain lions that prowl the city's
suburban fringe. One chapter in ``Ecology of Fear,'' on wildfires,
is titled, ``The Case for Letting Malibu Burn.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brady Westwater, a Malibu real estate agent and amateur
local historian who has appointed himself Davis' one-man truth
squad, has produced reams of material, circulated on the Internet
and among publications here and in New York, questioning almost
every claim he makes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something pathological about it,'' said Westwater, who
cites, as just one example among dozens, Davis' claim that the
local media has long downplayed Southern California's experience
with tornado-like storms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I checked the L.A. Times article he actually cites as evidence
of this reluctance, and it uses the words `tornado' or `twister' 13
times,'' Westwater said. ``You don't even have to check other
sources to prove he's lying. He does it himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis calmly contends that any book of such length and ambition
(it is 461 pages, including footnotes) is bound to contain errors.
``The thing you have to understand about these books is I'm a
Socialist,'' he said. ``This book has an utterly radical political
agenda, no holds barred.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Davis, who has taught at the Southern California Institute of
Architecture and is now on the verge of accepting a three-year
appointment to teach history ``deep in the faux-Colonial
architecture of Suffolk County,'' at the State University of New
York at Stony Brook, seems to slide reflexively into hyperbole.
</P>
<P>
   He referred to a friend, William Deverell, a respected professor
in his late 30s at the California Institute of Technology, as ``the
dean of L.A. historians.'' He mused of his recent visit to a Times
Square seemingly devoid of homeless people: ``What's Giuliani done?
Built gas chambers in Queens or something?''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Dutton, who owns the respected independent bookstore in
Brentwood that bears his name, had a long list of orders for
``Ecology'' before it was even published. He said Davis has ``an
enormous following'' among his upscale customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't help but think to a certain extent that if you agree
with his theories, you'll like the book, and if you don't, you
won't,'' Dutton said. ``It's a kind of analysis that's very
personal, almost a grand unified theory for Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis insists he loves the city, which is why he is so hard on
it, and says he is trying to inspire a new generation of labor
activists, environmentalists and academics to carry on the battles
for social justice that he himself fought as a civil rights
protester and Students for a Democratic Society member in the 60s.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged: ``Some people like the book because they
like the glamor of decay and apocalypse. Those people aren't the
people I write for, although they probably help sell the book.''

POPE CHALLENGES AMERICANS TO RAISE MORAL STANDARDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Journeying to America's heartland amid a wrenching
national political and moral debate, Pope John Paul II met
President Clinton Tuesday and challenged all Americans to ``a
higher moral vision.''
</P>
<P>
   In public remarks, John Paul made no direct reference to
President Clinton's fight for his political life as the Senate
continues its impeachment proceedings, but he did say that
``America faces a time of trial'' and a test of national character.
</P>
<P>
   While praising the United States for advancing the cause of
freedom in the world, John Paul chastized America for being
indifferent to the plight of society's weakest _ the poor, the
unborn and minorities and he exhorted the country to ``reaffirm the
genuine truths and values of the American experience.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of his strongest statements on one of the most explosive
issues roiling the United States, the pope compared the aborting of
babies to last century's infamous Dred Scott case, argued in St.
Louis, that declared slaves to be private property.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the pope said, ``after untold sufferring and with
enormous effort,'' the struggle by blacks to win their legal rights
has been largely successful.
</P>
<P>
   But the conflict, John Paul added, now is ``between a culture
that affirms, cherishes, and celibrates the gift of life, and a
culture that seeks to declare entire groups of human beings _ the
unborn, the terminally ill, the handicapped, and others considered
`unuseful' _ to be outside the boundaries of legal protection.''
</P>
<P>
   US Catholic leaders have been outspoken in their support of
legislation that would outlaw late-term abortions, a controversial
procedure that has become one of the newest and hottest
battlegrounds in the national abortion debate.
</P>
<P>
   In a private 20-minute meeting between Clinton and the pope,
abortion only ``came up in passing'' and the Monica Lewinsky affair
not at all, White House officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Lewinsky) topic was not included,'' agreed Vatican
spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls. The Vatican media have given scant
attention to the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The two men did talk about Cuba and Iraq, Navarro-Valls said,
two areas on which Clinton and the pontiff disagree. The pope
strongly opposes the US economic embargo against Cuba and Iraq,
arguing that it punishes children, the sick and the poor. On
Monday, the Vatican harshly criticized the United States latest air
strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq was a topic of conversation for a while, but the
positions on both sides were so clear that a real dialogue did not
develop,'' Navarro-Valls said.
</P>
<P>
   Inside an Air National Guard hangar at Lambert-St. Louis
International Airport, where a crowd of 2,500 had been waiting, the
pope received a much more boisterous welcome than Clinton, who was
accompanied by his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   During his speech, Clinton hailed John Paul for his role in
bringing down Communism but said that ``people still need to hear
your message that all are God's children, all have fallen short of
his glory. All of the injustices of yesterday cannot excuse a
single injustice today.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope arrived after a triumphant five-day visit to Mexico,
where he delivered a blueprint for the future of the church in the
Americas.
</P>
<P>
   On his seventh visit to US soil, John Paul was expected to
exhort his flock, particularly young Catholics, to build a more
moral and just society as the church prepares to enter the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   He called on America to ``open wide your hearts to the ever
increasing plight and urgent needs of our less fortunate brothers
and sisters throughout the world.''
</P>
<P>
   John Paul's first major event Tuesday was a raucous rally with
20,000 young people, giving the pontiff the chance to celebrate
with a demographic group he has particular affection for and from
which he always receives a strong spiritual boost.
</P>
<P>
   Showing he was in touch with youth culture, John Paul referred
to last year's record-breaking baseball season much to the delight
of the teens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am told that there was much excitement in St. Louis during
the recent baseball season, when two great players (Mark McGwire
and Sammy Sosa), were competing to break the home-run record,'' the
pope said. ``You can feel the same great enthusiasm as you train
for a different goal: the goal of following Christ, the goal of
bringing his message to the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the youths had traveled for hours from Ohio, Illinois,
Kentucky and other states to cheer on one of the world's most
admired men.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most awesome thing I've ever been to,'' said Chris
Nelson, 15, who with about 40 classmates rode a bus for four hours
from Notre Dame High School in Peoria, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   For small Midwestern city on the banks of the Mississippi River,
built by French Catholics, the visit of the leader of the world's 1
billion Roman Catholics is one of the biggest events in its,
bringing to St. Louis unprecedented international media attention.
</P>
<P>
   The pope literally brought the city to a standstill as downtown
streets were closed and many people sneaked out of work to get a
peep at John Paul as he rode by in his now-familiar ``popemobile.''
</P>
<P>
   About 1 million people, the biggest crowd St. Louis has drawn
since the 1904 world's fair, are expected to flood the city for the
30-hour papal visit.
</P>
<P>
   Banners, some in Polish, welcoming the pontiff were hung across
the city, from hotels, apartment buildings and pawnshops. One rock
'n roll station took advantage of the visit to depict the pope on a
billboard wearing headphones. The caption read: ``Father Knows
Best.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an incredible honor for this city and a wonderful
opportunity for it to shine,'' said Alex Volansky. ``It's all
anybody has been talking about for weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Volansky, along with his 20-year-old daughter, Julie, was won a
ticket to attend the welcoming ceremony inside the Missouri
National Guard hangar and rub shoulders with politicians, diplomats
and church leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The trip here, which culminates Wednesday with a Mass for over
100,000 people inside the TWA Dome, is a tip of the pope's skullcap
to John Paul's close friend, St. Louis Archbishop Justin Rigali,
who worked in the Vatican for many years and was a key adviser to
the pontiff during the early years of his 20-year pontificate.

<P>
   Starting Monday, five airlines in a marketing alliance called
One World are linking their frequent-flier programs so that members
using one of the carriers can earn and redeem miles on any of the
others.
</P>
<P>
   The group, which includes American Airlines, British Airways,
Canadian Airlines, Cathay Pacific Airways and Qantas Airways, also
aims to give reciprocal perks such as priority check-in to
high-level members of the airlines' frequent-flier programs.
</P>
<P>
   Members will be able to use miles accrued on flights on various
alliance members to achieve higher levels of status in the
frequent-flier program of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   Because the frequent-flier programs all have different names for
various tiers of membership, One World has established a set of
symbols _ Emerald, Sapphire and Ruby _ so that members' levels will
be recognized across the board.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the airlines' tiered frequent-flier programs (those
above entry level) will get new cards with the appropriate symbol,
or stickers to affix to their old cards, from the individual
frequent-flier programs, according to Mark Stitt, an American
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   There is one exception to the reciprocity: Passengers on British
Airways' direct routes between Europe and the Americas cannot earn
or redeem miles on American Airlines on those flights, and vice
versa. Existing aviation agreements between the United States and
Britain preclude such a link, according to John Lampl, a spokesman
for British Airways. Meanwhile, the two carriers are awaiting a new
aviation accord between the two countries that would pave the way
for them to pursue their own separate alliance in addition to One
World, he added.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to priority check-in, the One World alliance will
give eligible members access to some 220 airport clubs and lounges,
along with priority standby and wait listing.
</P>
<P>
   Finnair, which joined One World after the original alliance was
announced, will begin participating in the program later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Costs Rising at Slower Pace
</P>
<P>
   Though business travel costs will rise in 1999, the increase
will be only about half as much as last year's, according to an
annual study by American Express.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the company's 1999 forecast prices will go up 4 to 5
percent this year, compared with an estimate of nearly 9 percent
for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate hotel rates in the 25 top business cities will climb 7
to 8 percent, the study said. Car rental costs will go up 4 to 5
percent; air fares used by business travelers, 3 to 4 percent, and
restaurant meal prices, 2 to 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Budgetel Becomes Baymont
</P>
<P>
   It was nearly a year in coming, but the former Budgetel Inns,
which has operated under that name for 25 years, is now Baymont
Inns and Suites. The change, which had been announced last February
and took effect earlier this month, reflects the upgrading of the
properties, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The limited-service chain, with more than 160 locations in more
than 30 states, is a subsidiary of Marcus Corp. in Milwaukee. About
10 percent of the chain's rooms are business-class rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Work and Play
</P>
<P>
   ``All work and no play'' is not a slogan that fits the 501
business travelers surveyed recently by Cahners Corporate Research.
Three-quarters of them turned at least one business trip into a
partial vacation over the last year by extending their stay and
inviting a family member or friend to join them. Most of the hybrid
trips were taken in spring or summer, with travelers spending an
average of four days on business and three on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular destinations for extending a business trip were
San Francisco; Las Vegas; New York; Phoenix, and Orlando, Fla. The
survey was conducted for Hotels magazine in a questionnaire sent in
June to 2,000 subscribers to the North American Pocket Flight
Guide.

GROUP RETHINKS RATINGS ON YEAR 2000 READINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fearing that they might inadvertently cause a flight of capital
and destabilize some large developing countries, a group of
international banks, securities companies and insurers is weighing
a retreat from plans to publicly rate the readiness of more than 30
nations to avoid major year 2000 computer disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   Global 2000 Coordinating Group, which includes more than 230
institutions from 46 countries, announced its ratings plan at a
U.N. conference in New York last month with a promise to publish
its findings early in February. Countries exhibiting
``satisfactory'' progress and disclosure would be rated green;
those somewhat lacking in either category, yellow; those in
trouble, red, and those not providing enough information, black.
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 problem, or Y2K for short, is the inability of
some computers and electronic machinery to correctly read dates
after Dec. 31, 1999. Such devices can malfunction by freezing or by
spewing out incorrect data.
</P>
<P>
   Other groups are already providing country ratings, most notably
Gartner Group, a consulting firm based in Stamford, Conn., that
grades 87 countries. But the Global 2000 effort raised concerns
because of the worldwide financial influence of its members. The
group's access to central banks, national telephone and power
companies and other major institutions in the countries rated might
give the ratings extraordinary credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Global 2000 members said last month that the report should impel
countries that had been lagging in year 2000 efforts to work harder
and put pressure on all countries to make more information about
their progress public. Year 2000 consultants had called the planned
publicity a valuable alert and praised the group for setting an
example of cooperative information-sharing for the public good.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the announcement, though, critics began
suggesting that the financial group's ratings might create more
problems than benefits. That set off an internal debate that could
be resolved in a private meeting that begins in London on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I, and a lot of other members, can see both sides of the
argument,'' said James Devlin, the Citibank delegate to Global 2000
who has headed the working group of institutions that developed the
rating system and the plans to publish it.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers familiar with the debate said that federal regulators
and some major banks had raised concerns about capital flight,
especially from Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Some banks questioned whether publicizing the ratings might bog
the group down in lawsuits because the United States is the only
country with a law protecting those issuing good-faith readiness
assessments. And officials in countries with bad ratings might be
discouraged from sharing accurate information.
</P>
<P>
   Some also argued that the ratings pushed the financial companies
too far from Global 2000's main focus, which is encouraging
cooperative efforts to make sure that the financial sector faces
minimal disruptions. The group also develops model tests for banks
to follow in assessing their own Y2K progress, for example.
</P>
<P>
   But those who favor publication are not giving up easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think publicity will create panic,'' said J.P.
Rangaswami, a Global 2000 steering committee member from Dresdner
Kleinwort Benson, the investment banking arm of Germany's Dresdner
Bank. ``Others, including me, think publicity will create action
that reduces panic. Once we use our collective leverage to gather
information, we have a duty to make it public.''
</P>
<P>
   Another backer of issuing ratings, Robert Aylward of the Royal
Bank of Canada, said the issue was not whether the assessments were
perfect but whether they would create more opportunities for
dialogue.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Susan Jarrett, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's representative on
the working group headed by Devlin, agreed, saying: ``The best
reaction we could hope for is for people to dispute it. We got more
documentation than ever before when countries found out that they
were rated red.''
</P>
<P>
   Global 2000 members said that virtually all the material used in
the ratings had been gathered from public sources, although some
was from meetings in foreign countries that might not have been
widely publicized.
</P>
<P>
   Proposed ratings for each country have been shared with its
national Y2K coordinator. As of this week, no more than a handful
of national coordinators had objected to the accuracy of the
proposed ratings, according to a banker involved in the research.
</P>
<P>
   The ratings are not intended to be more than a snapshot of year
2000 readiness in key countries. In general, Global 2000 does not
intend to predict how far countries will get in their repair
programs. But the group has bluntly warned on its Web site
(www.global2k.com) that Russia will not solve its year 2000
problems in time.

THE POP LIFE: RAGING AGAINST AN UNUSUAL BENEFIT CONCERT
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: N.J., Pa.) (bl) 
By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When the rock group Rage Against the Machine heard
that the final appeal of Mumia Abu-Jamal, a journalist who was
sentenced to death in Pennsylvania for killing a police officer in
1981, had been rejected, the band decided to hold a benefit
concert. After all, celebrities, governments and human rights
organizations _ from Amnesty International to the European
Parliament _ have been clamoring for a new trial for Abu-Jamal.
</P>
<P>
   So Rage Against the Machine contacted friends in the Beastie
Boys and Bad Religion and arranged a benefit scheduled for Thursday
night at the Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford, N.J.,
which quickly sold out. But these bands did not anticipate the fury
and outrage their concert would inspire, especially since the last
time Abu-Jamal was scheduled to be executed, Rage Against the
Machine held a similar benefit in Washington, to little rancor.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman called the event
despicable and urged concertgoers not to go. New York state Sen.
Serphin Maltese accused ticket buyers of being ``pro-cop killer.''
The National Association of Police Organizations lambasted the
concert's organizers for lionizing ``a convicted cop killer.'' The
commander of the New Jersey State Police, responsible for providing
security for the show, declared his opposition. The general manager
of the Manhattan radio station K-Rock (WXRK 92.3 FM) apologized
on-air for promoting the concert, calling it a ``big-time''
mistake. And the arena offered refunds to ticket buyers unaware
that their money would benefit Abu-Jamal. The concert is expected
to bring in $375,000 in ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, when pop groups appear at benefits, they perform for
popular causes: helping cancer research, AIDS awareness, homeless
people. But this benefit is not so clear cut. Abu-Jamal was
convicted of shooting a Philadelphia police officer, Daniel
Faulkner, point-blank during an argument over a traffic violation,
but Abu-Jamal's supporters say he was set up, citing witness
tampering, suppression of evidence and a racially biased judge and
jury.
</P>
<P>
   Police and prosecutors have called the conviction fair, and the
Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in October that there would not be
a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Morello, Rage's guitarist, said that no groups turned down
the band's invitation to perform, and many others _ ranging from
the folk duo the Indigo Girls to the heavy-metal heroes Black
Sabbath to the Latin big band Ozomatli _ offered to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the first time that Rage Against the Machine has
opened up a can of worms by standing up for what we believed in,''
Morello said from his Manhattan hotel Tuesday. ``We've had the Ku
Klux Klan protest our shows, but I didn't expect this from the
governor of New Jersey's office.''
</P>
<P>
   The others performing in the concert were equally caught off
guard. The Beastie Boys distanced themselves from the controversy
by declining to talk about it, and Greg Graffin, the Bad Religion
singer, said he felt like the victim of a smear campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Graffin said his band had always promoted ``skeptical inquiry,''
and that this had been absent from Abu-Jamal's case.``But I want to
emphatically state that this does not mean we support cop
killers.''
</P>
<P>
   Graffin and Morello said they felt that the benefit, arranged to
help win a new trial for Abu-Jamal, had been wrongly portrayed by
its opponents as a village meeting of police haters.
</P>
<P>
   Morello said he saw a model for the event in Bob Dylan's benefit
concerts for Rubin (Hurricane) Carter in the mid-'70s. At the time,
Carter, a former middleweight boxer, was serving three life
sentences for a triple murder, and Dylan helped begin the process
that led to a 1985 judge's order to release Carter because the case
had been tainted by corrupted evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not some far-flung left-field crazy case,'' Morello
continued. ``This is as mainstream as human rights cases get:
you've got Amnesty International on board saying give him a new
trial. But because the incident involved the killing of a
policeman, all rationality goes out the window. I would think that
any decent policeman would want this guy to have another trial. If
they're so sure he's guilty, why not?''
</P>
<P>
   The Pope Goes Pop
</P>
<P>
   An opponent of the death penalty recently signed a deal with
Sony Music: Pope John Paul II. This week Sony announced the
addition of the pope to its roster of recording artists, which also
includes pop stars like Korn, Pearl Jam, George Michael, Celine
Dion and the Fugees.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's major-label debut will be called ``Abba Pater'' and
is to be released internationally by Sony Classical on March 23 as
a marketing tie-in with Holy Week and Easter. The recordings
consist of prayers, homilies and chants culled from radio
broadcasts that the pope has made over the last 20 years. Much of
it has been supplemented by new recordings of classical, world and
easy-listening music by Italian composers.
</P>
<P>
   And the CD is just the beginning of the pope's popular-music
career. He will also be making a music video for the single,
``Pater Noster (Our Father).'' It will debut on the Web sites of
Sony Classical and the Vatican next month.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Waits on Tour
</P>
<P>
   Tom Waits, who hasn't toured in more than 10 years, may be back
on the road. The reclusive performer, whose concert appearances
this decade have been chiefly limited to benefits, is looking into
a small tour to support his first album of new music in six years,
``Mule Variations.''
</P>
<P>
   The 16-song record, with guest appearances from the quirk-rock
band Primus and the blues harmonica master Charlie Musselwhite, is
due on April 20 on Epitaph Records, best known for its punk bands.
A spokeswoman for Epitaph said that no performances have been
confirmed, but Waits is looking at dates in April and May,
including shows in New York and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Waits has also been busy playing a perverted doctor in ``Mystery
Men,'' a film starring Janeane Garafalo, Ben Stiller and William H.
Macy about a group of bumbling superheroes. The movie is scheduled
to open Aug. 9.
</P>
<P>
   From Rap to Hoops
</P>
<P>
   Master P, the Louisiana rapper and entrepreneur whose No Limit
label helped him rake in over $50 million last year, is moving
closer to his latest dream: to make it into the NBA. Late last
year, he surprised his fans by joining the Fort Wayne Fury, an
Indiana team in the Continental Basketball Association. At the time
he said that he had retired as a rapper and pledged to try out for
the National Basketball Association after the lockout. Now that the
lockout has ended, Master P has left the Fury _ he was responsible
for more personal fouls, 24, than points, 15, in the eight games he
played _ and is training with the Charlotte Hornets in North
Carolina, his spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   In his first scrimmage with the team on Saturday, Master P, a
6-foot-4-inch point guard, racked up nine points and four assists.
Normally just a few thousand fans show up to watch the Hornets, but
on Saturday there were more than 15,000. Not every player who
practices with the Hornets makes the team, and those who have seen
Master P play say that he is not at NBA level. But a spokesman for
the Hornets said Master P was under consideration.

FAITHFUL GATHER TO CATCH GLIMPSE OF DEPARTING POPE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DUDLEY ALTHAUS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The sun hadn't yet risen above the skyscrapers
Tuesday, but hundreds of people, fearing they were too late,
scurried down the wide boulevard toward the compound where Pope
John Paul II had slept four nights.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the pope's two escort helicopters were making wide
circles over the neighborhood, indicating that John Paul would soon
depart in a motorcade for Mexico City's airport and fly to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people pressed against the metal barriers set up
across the normally busy intersection a block from the papal
envoy's residence where John Paul was staying. Still more people
lined the streets that the pontiff would travel on his way to the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   Those arriving after sunrise had little chance of getting a good
view of the 78-year-old pope, because the best spots had already
been taken. But people packed in anyway, many of them knowing this
would likely be their final chance to see John Paul in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the fourth time he has come, and we know it will
probably be his last,'' said Jorge Ocampo, a 47-year-old architect
who stood immobile toward the back of the crowd. ``God bless him,
he's gotten old. But it's important _ it's impressive _ to see the
faith of our people.''
</P>
<P>
   On the flight to Mexico from Rome on Friday, the pontiff had
joked with reporters that Mexicans hadn't let him sleep on his
three previous trips to the country, waking him with song on many
mornings.
</P>
<P>
   During this papal visit, barricades manned by police and
plainclothes security officers kept everyone away from the papal
envoy's compound except people who live in the leafy, middle-class
neighborhood on the south side of the Mexican capital. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``Thank you for your fervor,'' read a banner draped from palm
trees on the boulevard in front of the compound. ``Thank you for
respecting the rest of the Holy Father.''
</P>
<P>
   But on the last day of John Paul's stay in Mexico _ the first
country he visited as pope before making 84 other foreign trips _
people were determined to give him a send-off.
</P>
<P>
   Estela Garcia de Leon, 61, and her friend Concepcion Santos, 50,
arrived at the corner near the papal envoy's compound at 4 a.m.
after traveling by bus from a distant corner of the city. Both
women said they saw John Paul twice over the weekend but wanted to
catch a glimpse of him one more time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are interested in everything he says, in all that he
does,'' said a giggling Garcia de Leon. ``It's worth all the hours
we have to wait, all the trouble we have to take to get here.''
</P>
<P>
   Preceded by phalanxes of motorcycle police and stony-faced
security officers in sport utility vehicles, John Paul finally
whisked by the corner about 8:30 a.m., his face impassive but one
hand waving slightly.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd roared a final time. ``The pope! The pope! The pope!''
</P>
<P>
   Then it was over.
</P>
<P>
   Children headed to school, businessmen hurried to their
officers, homemakers went home. The security men took down the
barricades, and the usual morning traffic jams formed almost
instantly along the neighborhood's boulevards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at all these people,'' said Angela Lucas de Mateos, 60,
as she watched the crowd disperse. ``We are here for faith, for
Christianity. People wouldn't do this for a president, for any
corrupt politician.''
</P>
<P>
   A few people gathered in front of the papal envoy's gate, hands
dismantling the elaborate tapestry made of artificial flowers that
adorned the entrance. Young men climbed the display as high as they
could and passed pieces of the colorful plastic mosaic to those who
wanted them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a final memory,'' Maria Ponce, a middle-aged woman from
an indigenous village outside of Mexico City, said of the red and
yellow plastic she held to her breast. ``We want just a little
something.''
</P>
<P>
   A small crowd gathered at a small sandwich shop across the
street from the envoy's compound, eyes fixed on the small
television that showed the pope's departure ceremony at the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   The sounds of meat sizzling on the griddle and people calling
out orders for sandwiches drowned some of the speeches delivered by
President Ernesto Zedillo and John Paul. But the knot of people in
the shop didn't seem to care.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks so tired,'' Josefina Arguelles said of the pope, as
she and a daughter sipped black coffee from plastic cups. ``Time
changes. I don't know how he can manage all of this.''
</P>
<P>
   As the pope spoke, one woman said a prayer, her lips moving
slightly as she murmured.
</P>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Republican leaders on Tuesday took the
gamble that they can open the door to witnesses and yet still
somehow bring the trial of President Clinton to a relatively quick,
dignified and non-confrontational conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, and his
deputies have struggled to find a footing in the midst of powerful
political cross currents: the general public overwhelmingly wants
the impeachment drive to end, but the party's conservative base
demands that it move forward.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans have wondered just what loyalty they owe to
their colleagues in the House, who pulled them over the cliff once
before during the government shutdown of 1995-1996. And they wonder
what kind of precedents they are creating for history.
</P>
<P>
   With all these conflicting impulses in mind, Lott has now
arranged a middle ground for his party: to approve subpoenas for
just three witnesses (aside from a House request, which may be
ignored, that the Senate invite Clinton to testify), with sharply
limited questioning time that could bring the Senate to an end to
the trial by mid-February. Although some Republicans were still
wavering, Lott seemed likely to win when the Senate votes Wednesday
on whether to depose witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just trying to have a fair process here,'' the
Mississippi Republican said this week, ``but one that gets us to a
conclusion, as soon as possible, without rushing to judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott has been navigating his way through a caucus of many views,
not always following predictable ideological predilections.
Conservatives like James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, Wayne Allard of
Colorado and Don Nickles, the majority whip from Oklahoma, or
former House members like Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania have pushed
to support the House with a full trial and as many witnesses as the
prosecutors wanted, Republicans say.
</P>
<P>
   But moderates like Susan M. Collins of Maine and John H. Chafee
of Rhode Island have also argued for witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Shelby of Alabama, a usual ally of Lott's has been one
of the Republicans most skeptical about witnesses. And Richard
Lugar of Indiana, usually a centrist, has been mostly quiet in
caucus, Republicans say, but sounded fierce on Tuesday when he
blamed the White House for any partisanship developing in the
Senate. ``The White House has stonewalled almost every opportunity
to inquire about the president's activities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To hold this group together and win a majority for witnesses,
Lott has steadily reined in the House prosecutors. They once wanted
to call 15 witnesses instead of the three they ultimately settled
for on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He thus has played almost the opposite role as the leadership in
the House. There Rep. Tom DeLay, the majority whip, aggressively
pushed impeachment forward, by cleverly pushing moderates to vote
for impeachment, by not allowing them an easy out through a censure
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   The House prosecutors made it clear on Tuesday they were less
than delighted. ``We have always believed and we still do believe
that 10 or 12 witnesses are what we should have, and should have
been permitted to call to prove our case,'' Rep. Bill McCollum,
R-Fla., said.

RUSSIA, U.S. SEEK COMMON GROUND IN KOSOVO SETTLEMENT  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia and the United States Tuesday called on both
sides that are fighting in Kosovo to hold talks toward achieving a
political settlement in the Serbian province, while the United
States spoke more openly of using force to compel the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Russia remains firmly opposed to using force. But a joint
statement, issued on the second day of a visit by Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, would be helpful in showing the Yugoslav
leader, Slobodan Milosevic, that he cannot automatically count on
the Russians for support, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   And for the first time Tuesday, Albright refused to rule out
using American ground troops as part of a peacekeeping mission in
Kosovo, saying, ``We would examine that among other options.''
</P>
<P>
   An administration official said that the United States had
``moved further along'' toward possible use of ground troops in
Kosovo, an option that appeared virtually unthinkable last week.
</P>
<P>
   In the statement Tuesday, the Russians went further than they
had before in calling on Milosevic to restrain his police and
military units in Kosovo, which is a province of Serbia, but where
more than 90 percent of the population is ethnic Albanian. The
ethnic Albanians are calling for independence.
</P>
<P>
   In calling for a political settlement, both the United States
and Russia said that both sides in the Kosovo conflict must accept
``substantial autonomy'' for the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting of NATO ambassadors in Brussels Tuesday, the United
States continued to push for an ultimatum to be issued to both
sides that threatened air strikes if they did not agree to a
political settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has traditionally been more sympathetic to the
nationalism of fellow Slavs in Serbia than many Western countries.
Serbia is one of two republics remaining in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   In the joint statement on Kosovo issued by Albright and Ivanov,
the Russians also agreed for the first time to push Milosevic to
accept investigators from the war crimes tribunal in the Hague to
investigate the killings of 45 ethnic Albanians this month in the
village of Racak.
</P>
<P>
   The statement between Russia and the United States on Kosovo was
the most immediate result of the Moscow meetings, which covered a
gamut of strategic and economic issues at the most troubled time in
American and Russian relations since the breakup of the Soviet
Union. Despite the paucity of specific agreements, Albright and
Ivanov tried to put the best face on the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Asked at their joint news conference whether the United States
has been ignoring Russia, Albright, who stood beside Ivanov on a
stage at a press center here, replied: ``The proof is in the
pudding _ or me. I am here because we are neither ignoring nor
avoiding or dismissing Russia and its views.''
</P>
<P>
   A more defensive Ivanov said that Albright had explained the
Clinton administration's plans for a new missile defense system and
its effect on the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which the
Russians believe is sacred to nuclear arms control. The new
position of the Americans is ``being studied very thoroughly,''
Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
   But he made clear that the Russians resent what they consider
the hardball tactics of the United States on the nonproliferation
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Albright pressed the Russians again to stop what the
administration asserts is help to Iran with nuclear missile
technology.
</P>
<P>
   In a recognition of the volatile political landscape in Russia,
Albright reached out to some of the people who are likely to run in
next year's presidential election. She met Monday with Yuri Luzkov,
the mayor of Moscow, and Tuesday with Alexander Lebed, the former
general who is now governor of a region in Siberia. She also met
with Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of a liberal party.
</P>
<P>
   The encounter with Luzkov was quite fiery, according to accounts
from American officials. Luzkov vigorously attacked U.S. policy
toward Iraq and Kosovo and expressed concern that the United States
wanted to kill the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.
</P>
<P>
   She spoke by telephone with President Boris Yeltsin, who remains
in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion of possible ground troops in Kosovo was an
inevitable outcome of the increasing talk at NATO about possible
air strikes against Serbian targets in Kosovo. If air strikes
occurred, some kind of peacekeeping force would have to be deployed
in Kosovo afterward.
</P>
<P>
   As the NATO ambassadors met in Brussels Tuesday, there were
talks with NATO military commanders about limited air strikes or a
longer phased air campaign, a Western diplomat said. The diplomat
said they also were discussing the context in which an ultimatum
would be issued.
</P>
<P>
   But there was still disagreement among the NATO allies about
which diplomatic channels to use and in what order to use them,
Administration officials said. Before issuing a NATO ultimatum, the
French and British want to hold a meeting of the so-called Contact
Group, which includes Russia, and is dedicated to resolving issues
of the countries that once made up a larger Yugoslavia, an
administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   But Albright, who was so irritated after attending a meeting of
the Contact Group last year that she dismissed it as the ``lowest
common denominator of diplomacy,'' was not anxious to attend a
Contact Group meeting, the officials said.

IN VICTORY FOR STARR, TAX FRAUD CASE IS REINSTATED AGAINST WEBSTER
HUBBELL

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a significant victory for Kenneth Starr, a
divided Federal appeals panel on Tuesday reinstated a tax fraud
case he had brought against Webster Hubbell, a longtime Arkansas
friend of president and Mrs. Clinton. The court majority said that
a lower-court judge was wrong when he threw out the caseon grounds
that the independent counsel had overreached, essentially
conducting ``a fishing expedition.''
</P>
<P>
   The 2-1 ruling provides new leverage for Starr to press Hubbell
for information damaging to the Clintons, even though he has
insisted he has no such information. Starr has asserted in court
filings that Hubbell accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in
bogus consulting fees from Clinton's political supporters on which
he paid no taxes. Starr contended the payments were ``hush money''
meant to discourage him from disclosing what he knows about the
Clintons' financial dealings in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   In upholding Starr's right to bring the tax fraud case, the
United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
even affirmed the idea that the fees paid to Hubbell appeared, in
fact, to be hush money. ``The timing, sources and extent of the
payments make the belief that they were hush money reasonable,''
said the majority opinion written by Judge Stephen F. Williams, an
appointee of President Reagan, and joined by Judge Patricia M.
Wald, named to the bench by President Carter. Judge David S. Tatel,
appointed by President Clinton, dissented from that portion of the
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   But the appeals court also raised a possible obstacle to Starr
in prosecuting the tax case. In a separate 2-1 ruling with Wald and
Tatel in the majority, the panel raised questions about whether
Starr may build his tax case on documents he collected from Hubbell
under a grant of immunity.
</P>
<P>
   The court said the independent counsel must establish that it
did not rely on Hubbell's testimony to obtain the financial
documents that are a major part of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the ruling affords Starr some measure of legitimacy
in an area in which he had been widely criticized, that is whether
his investigation had improperly strayed far beyond his original
mandate of investigating Whitewater, the Arkansas land deal
involving the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell's case, in fact, had other repercussions. Some of the
fees he received that Starr said amounted to hush money came from
Revlon and were arranged by Vernon Jordan, a close friend of the
president. It was Jordan's help in seeking a job for Monica S.
Lewinsky that Starr cited in seeking permission to expand his
investigation into Clinton's relationship with the former intern.
</P>
<P>
   In dismissing the tax fraud case against Hubbell last July, U.S.
District Court Judge James Robertson reflected the criticism that
Starr had reached well beyond his mandate, calling the subpoena in
the tax fraud prosecution ``a quintessential fishing expedition.''
</P>
<P>
   But the majority on Tuesday said that it was reasonable to
relate the possibility that Hubbell accepted hush money to the
original scope of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If payments Hubbell received beginning in 1994 were indeed
hush money to secure Hubbell's silence vis-a-vis Whitewater, the
possible obstruction of justice therein would certainly be a crime
`relating to' Whitewater for it would be an attempt to cover up
wrongdoing afterward,'' the majority opinion said. The judges then
went on to criticize Robertson, saying that the Supreme Court has
upheld the constitutionality of the independent counsel law and
that ``it is not for lower court judges to undercut that decision
by constructions of the act that prevent this prosecutor from
performing his duty in a manner reasonably approximating that of an
ordinary prosecutor.''
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell was the No. 3 official in the Justice Department when he
was first became involved in the independent counsel investigation.
He was once the chief justice of the state of Arkansas, a position
to which he had been appointed by Clinton when he was that state's
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's ruling also means that Hubbell, who has already served
a prison sentence on charges brought by the independent counsel,
now faces two additional trials on separate charges brought by
Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell spent nearly 17 months in prison after pleading guilty
to bilking his partners in the Little Rock, Ark., law firm at which
he once worked with Mrs. Clinton. But Starr failed to get from
Hubbell what he was really after: incriminating evidence about the
Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   Starr then brought the indictment for tax fraud that was
reinstated on Tuesday. Last November, Starr brought yet another
indictment against Hubbell, charging that he had concealed
information about the role he and Mrs. Clinton played in a
complicated land transaction in Arkansas that helped lead to the
collapse of a savings and loan association.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell has said that he does not know of wrongdoing on the part
of the Clintons and that ``nothing the independent counsel can do
to me is going to make me lie about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The tax fraud indictment that was reinstated on Tuesday accused
Hubbell; his wife, Suzanna; and two advisers, Michael Schaufele, an
accountant, and Charles C. Owen, a lawyer, of scheming over four
years to evade taxes and penalties on more than $850,000 in income.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing outside his Washington-area home this afternoon,
Hubbell said, ``We're innocent, not only myself but my wife and my
friends, of any of the underlying charges.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how much of an obstacle the second part of
Tuesday's ruling would prove for Starr. The appeals court said that
to use the financial documents to make his case, Starr must show
``reasonably particular knowledge'' of their existence before
Hubbell turned over more than 13,000 pages under a grant of
immunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should the independent counsel prove unable to meet the
requisite evidentiary burden, the contents of those documents will
be inadmissible,'' the court ruled. Charles Bakaly, a spokesman for
Starr, said on Tuesday that the office of independent counsel was
prepared to demonstrate it was entitled to use the financial
documents.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has said he knew about consulting payments Hubbell
received from the Riady family of Indonesia and the city of Los
Angeles. But the appeals panel said that ``these snippets of
information do not come close to establishing the existence of the
myriad of documents sought through the subpoena.''
</P>
<P>
   John W. Nields, Hubbell's lawyer, declined to say Tuesday night
whether he would appeal the latest ruling.

PARTY UNITY, DEFERENCE TO HOUSE FUELING GOP SENATORS' RESOLVE

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In pressing forward with a call for witnesses,
Republican Senators often cite the Constitution or their
disapproval of President Clinton. But there is a more political
explanation: Senators may see it in their own best interest to
maintain cordial relations with Republicans in the House.
</P>
<P>
   This may seem surprising given that historically, Republicans
and Democrats in the Senate are known for bonding more with one
another than with their counterparts _ even from the same party _
across the Capitol Rotunda.
</P>
<P>
   Republican strategists and politicians concede that Senators
face great pressure from the party's conservative base to move
ahead with the trial. But they also said there was a growing
recognition among Republican Senators that the more united their
party is on impeachment, the better positioned it would be to
tackle their legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, while they may have qualms about pressing ahead
with witnesses, many Senators are reluctant to do anything to
discredit what they think has been a good faith effort by House
impeachment managers to make their case. Several senators said in
interviews that they feel particularly inclined to cooperate after
House members pared down their list of witnesses to three on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been immersed in this case, they know it well,'' said
Sen. John H. Chafee, R-R.I. ``They say they need discovery. OK,
let's give them discovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying he was pleased that the House managers limited their
witness list, Chafee added, ``Frankly, I was stunned when they came
back with only three. Three cheers.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, said, ``They've only asked for
three witnesses. That's a very reasonable request. Let's at least
let them depose them.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason that the Senate seems deferential to the House is
that the Senate seems in some ways to be becoming more like the
more populist House. Many senators who are pressing hardest
behind-the-scenes for moving forward with the trial at a deliberate
pace are former House members themselves: Don Nickles and James M.
Inhofe of Oklahoma, Jon Kyl of Arizona, Rick Santorum of
Pennsylvania and Connie Mack of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans with an eye to the presidential race next
year also said the last thing they want are Republicans running
against the party's congressional wing. That is what Bill Clinton
did in 1992 when he essentially campaigned against his own party in
Congress. He won the White House, but Democrats lost seats in the
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we move beyond this trial, we have to get to things like
Social Security reform and tax cuts and health care reform and
education,'' said Ed Gillespie, a strategist with close ties to
Republican leaders in Congress. ``And the House and Senate
Republicans have to be together in the next six months because if
they're not, you're going to create an environment where even the
most ardent Republican presidential candidate will seek to define
himself or herself in contrast to Republicans in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillespie said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott was taking his
time to try to accommodate all sides. ``It's a matter of letting
the cake bake all the way through,'' he said. ``It is not quite
done yet. It doesn't quite bounce back when you put your fork
through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead to the elections in 2000, Mickey Edwards, a former
Republican House leader from Oklahoma who now teaches government at
Harvard University, said: ``Senators are a little afraid of doing
anything that makes House Republicans look even worse. If we lost
control of the House, the effectiveness of the Senate Republicans
is much reduced. They're marginalized.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Edwards asserted that Senate Republicans should be more
worried about the potential damage to the party from the
impeachment trial than about relations with the House. He said of
senators pressing for witnesses: ``It's like people running head on
to an incoming train and, for whatever reason, not getting off the
track.''
</P>
<P>
   Rich Galen, a strategist who is close to former Speaker Newt
Gingrich, said many senators who had been furious at their House
counterparts for sticking them with the trial have since become
impressed with how House managers have handled themselves. ``There
is a strong desire on the part of most Senate Republicans that the
House proceeding not be characterized as being fraudulent,'' Galen
said. ``They will not do things that will allow the White House to
turn around and say, `It was a witch hunt.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But some Republicans scoffed at the notion that Senate
Republicans need to preserve relations with House Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't given five seconds thought to that!'' said one
House Republican, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ``The
Senate looks down at the House. They say, `You're in the pea soup.'
They say, `You need us more than we need you.' They're the
patricians and we're the common thieves who happened to get
elected.''

 &HT;    Jamal Anderson: Not one bit shy
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ It was the entertainment portion of the afternoon. An
audience awaited his arrival. But the lead performer was up in his
room, stalling.
</P>
<P>
   What do you want? He was only 7 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that was the last time I got stage fright,'' Jamal
Anderson said. ``My parents used to have these huge barbecues for
these people, and they used to ask me and my brothers to do these
huge performances. But I didn't want to do it....It was one of
those `New Edition' songs or something. But I was nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson has been a lot of things this week. Nervous is not one
of them. From his first news conference, when he jokingly scolded
one media member for having a cheap tape recorder, to telling
another, ``Man, I know you can't dance _ you look like both your
knees are broken,'' to describing the Dirty Bird dance as ``Gregory
Hines meets Baryshnikov,'' it's clear he has been on stage.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson has hungered for attention since being buried deep in
the 1994 NFL draft, in the seventh round. He grew up taking
graduate courses in media relations and marketing from the various
celebrities who were clients of his father, James Anderson, a
personal security guard. And what better time to launch your
publicity campaign than on stage of the planet's biggest media
event?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to be natural,'' Anderson said. ``People say
I'm a ham. I'm not a ham. I'm just doing my thing.... Seriously,
any time you can do something like this, you have to think about
that. Maybe that's from being around those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Note pads and cameras have been five deep around Anderson. On
Monday, he said he got a facial to prepare for Tuesday's photo day.
Some suspected he actually wore makeup Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way _ does my skin look that good?'' Anderson said.
``Europeans have shown us the way. Look at you guys. I know a good
place down in South Beach you should go to.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Anderson mugs for a photographer. ``Did you get a
good angle?'' he said. ``You should come around the front. I don't
like that side of my face.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson hopes to mug on several occasions after this game. The
Falcons have opened negotiations for a deal that could rival the
nine-year, $51.9 million contract of the Broncos' Terrell Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest difference between me and Terrell,'' Anderson
said, ``is his contract, for now, and about 30 pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Off the field, his glibness should help him on Madison Avenue,
particularly if the Falcons pull an upset in the Super Bowl.
Anderson currently has modest deals with Nike and Zero Tolerance.
``I wanted to make sure I looked good today. Is my hair tight?''
</P>
<P>
   He smiled. He talked about being ignored by major recruiters.
``Some coaches said I wouldn't make it to the NFL if didn't sign
with them. I may have to get them one day in my book.'' He talked
about the depressing draft day. ``I was listening to all the other
names going ahead of me, taking mental notes.'' He talked about
growing up with celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to watch Muhammad (Ali) and Ray (Leonard) at their
press conferences. They showed me how you can still be in your
element even when you're not in your athletic field.''
</P>
<P>
   He jokingly complained about the ``100 unauthorized'' versions
of Dirty Bird songs, then teased the media about unveiling a new
version Sunday: ``The all-around-the-world Bird.'' He wouldn't
demonstrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't sneak backstage to see the showgirls before the
show,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Anderson continued to bask in the spotlight. ``I figured it
like this,'' he said. ``I used to hate public speaking. But I
figured if I was going to have to do all these press conferences
one day, I might as well get used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   A postscript: As a 7-year-old, Anderson finally came out to
sing.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Schultz writes for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution,
Atlanta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Story Filed By Cox _ the best mark in the NFL since the Oakland
Raiders averaged 16.3 in 1989. Unlike the West Coast-style passing
games that are prevalent in the league, the Falcons will stretch
the secondary down the field. Just as with his running game, Reeves
wants the pass going ahead, not sideways.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves likes strong-armed passers with touch on the deep ball.
One of the reasons he did not re-sign popular Bobby Hebert in 1997
was that Hebert lacked the arm strength to play in his offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``They play ball possession with the running game, not with the
pass,'' New Orleans Saints defensive coordinator Zaven Yaralian
said. ``When the Falcons throw, they're looking for the big play
downfield. They want something substantial from it. Their approach
is to draw you in with the run, make you commit another body to the
line of scrimmage and then bomb you deep. It's been very effective
for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons ranked fourth in the NFL in 1998 in pass completions
of 25 yards or more. Chandler led the league in yards-per-attempt
at 9.65. Most NFL teams regard the yards-per-attempt statistic as
the most significant on offense and are happy with anything around
7 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's passing attack does not appear to be complex. But the
system is effective, creating openings into which the wide
receivers run. Many times, if wide receivers Terance Mathis and
Tony Martin beat the initial hit at the line, they encounter little
traffic downfield because zones have been cleared.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, it is a two-wide-receiver set. Chandler's passer rating
with two wideouts on the field this season was significantly better
than with three wide receivers. One of the ironies of Atlanta's
victory against Minnesota in the NFC Championship Game was the
29-yard catch by slot receiver Ronnie Harris on the late drive that
tied the game. Like the Broncos, the Falcons got little production
from their third wideout; slot receivers Todd Kinchen, Tim Dwight
and Harris combined for 16 catches.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons also don't throw often to theias lost a half-step
but still is fast enough to run through some double coverages. He
will force Atwater to check him deep.
</P>
<P>
   For the Broncos, the riddle is how to pressure Chandler. By
nature, Denver is not a big blitzing team on the early downs. But
because the Falcons will use maximum protection to insulate
Chandler, sometimes sending only two receivers out on routes, the
Broncos might have to come at him more aggressively.

   The Falcons' ``Z-post'' is similar to the pass play the Broncos
ran in the AFC title game that started their second-half comeback
against the New York Jets. Wide receiver Terance Mathis, aligned to
the left, runs a deep crossing route and hopes to influence the
coverage of Broncos free safety Steve Atwater. Flanked to the
right, wide receiver Tony Martin runs a deep post pattern. Tight
end O.J. Santiago runs a short option route in the right hook area.
The Falcons protect Chris Chandler with seven blockers.

 &HT;    City matchups: Fashion for the Super Bowl
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pro sports teams often agonize over their uniforms, switching
styles and colors every few years _ thereby compelling
souvenir-shoppers to follow suit. The Falcons and Broncos have each
undergone makeovers during the '90s. A state-of-the-jerseys report:
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA
</P>
<P>
   True to the NFC's hard-nosed style of play, the conference
champion Falcons sport a no-frills look. Their jerseys, pants and
accessories are in not-so-adventurous shades: red, pale gray and
black. If the Falcons were supermodels, they could appear in
Reebok's show.
</P>
<P>
   As the home team in the Super Bowl, the Falcons likely will wear
their black jerseys and their customary gray pants with
black-and-red stripes. It's a color scheme that reeks of
masculinity, but the contrast between the tops and bottoms is
flattering only on the Falcons with the most streamlined of
physiques. Everyone on the team looks more chiseled when the
Falcons wear white jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   Also in keeping with the Falcons' no-nonsense approach to the
game, their jerseys' numbers are in the traditional block style.
Overall, the Falcons' uniforms contribute to the illusion that
they're bulkier, slower and more boring than they actually are. If
the Broncos aren't careful, the Falcons' style of dress could lure
them into a false sense of superiority.
</P>
<P>
   DENVER
</P>
<P>
   The reigning Super Bowl champions are disciples of West
Coast-style offenses. If they make fashion faux-pas, they do so
unabashedly. How else to explain their enduring crush on orange,
which clashes with the team's other colors: blue and white?
</P>
<P>
   When Broncos players with taste get ready to suit up, they must
grit their teeth and adhere to the ''Just Do It'' motto of their
outfitter, Nike.
</P>
<P>
   As the away team, Denver is expected to show up for the game in
a mostly monochromatic color scheme. That means white jerseys,
white pants. Nike's nudging is noticeable in that there are odd,
orange Swooshes on the Broncos' rib cages and outer thighs.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos also are up to some numerical shennanigans this
season. Their numbers are a stylistic mix of angles and curves. The
Falcons must caution against being dazzled by Denver's haberdashery
and focus on the mission at hand.

EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS MAY BE LINKED TO LA NINA
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By WILLIAM K. STEVENS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Record snows in Buffalo, N.Y., and Chicago. Record numbers of
tornadoes in the country's midsection. All-time low temperatures in
Indiana and Maine. Double the normal amount of precipitation,
coupled with an extended warm spell, in New York. What accounts for
this month's run of extreme weather?
</P>
<P>
   One big factor, experts say, is probably La Nina: an abnormally
cold pool of water stretching across the equatorial Pacific that
causes far-flung changes in the atmosphere's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   La Nina may not be as familiar as its opposite number, El Nino,
which warms the Pacific instead of cooling it. It does not appear
as often, and its impact is somewhat less predictable and
clear-cut. But this winter, government scientists say, its
interaction with routine climate behavior has produced an unusual
run of weather in North America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's La Nina plus the normal chaotic variability of the
atmosphere,'' said Dr. Gerry Bell, a researcher at the Climate
Prediction Center of the National Weather Service in Camp Springs,
Md. While no single weather event can be directly attributed to La
Nina (or to El Nino, for that matter), it has been ``a big player''
in this winter's events, Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, says the Weather Service, more of the same appears
in the cards for the rest of the winter. ``Everyone should be
prepared, because extreme weather may reoccur this cold season,''
Ed O'Lenic, one of Bell's colleagues, said in an advisory issued
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The El Nino-La Nina cycle is wholly natural. But some scientists
believe that extreme weather generally is increasing as a result of
an observed rise in the average global surface temperature of 1
degree Fahrenheit over the last century. A warmer atmosphere
stimulates more precipitation, for instance. Whether the warming is
also modifying the El Nino-La Nina cycle in some way is an open
question.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was only a year ago that the most recent edition of El Nino,
one of the two most powerful on record, altered and strengthened
storm tracks flowing from the Pacific into North America. As a
result, storm after storm slammed into California and skimmed
across the southern tier of the country. Mudslides plagued the West
Coast, while killer tornadoes ravaged Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the rest of the country basked in unusual warmth. And
on the other side of the world, droughts and forest fires plagued
Indonesia and other parts of normally wet Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But in May, the extra-warm Pacific waters that define El Nino
began to lose much of their heat, and by autumn those waters had
become abnormally cool, ushering in La Nina. Now sea-surface
temperatures along the Equator are 2 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit below
normal, marking the existence of what the Federal scientists call
``mature La Nina conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Those conditions are expected to persist until May or June, then
begin to decay. What will happen after that is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   La Nina's effects on the atmosphere now, as it impinges on North
America, seem clear. Its main impact has been to alter the path of
the jet stream, the high-altitude river of air that runs from west
to east and marks the boundary between cold air masses from the
north and warm ones from the tropics. It is along this boundary,
where warm and cold air clash, that most winter storms develop.
</P>
<P>
   La Nina's main signature in North America is an exaggerated
pattern of jet stream flow in which the jet, leaving the North
Pacific region, frequently curves northward around a vast
high-pressure system near Alaska, then plunges down into Montana
and the Northern Plains and then into the central part of the
country before curving northeastward again. On the northern and
western sides of the downward bulge is cold winter air from Canada;
on the southern and eastern sides, warm tropical air from the
South. These circulation patterns typically span the entire
country. The weather any locality gets depends on where it is
situated in relation to them.
</P>
<P>
   The clash of the two big air masses is what led to this month's
tornadoes _ more than 100 so far, almost double the previous record
for January, 52. Thirty-one twisters touched down in Tennessee,
Arkansas and Mississippi on Jan. 17, followed by an outbreak of 55
more across the South on Jan. 21 and 22.
</P>
<P>
   In a normal winter, a southward bulge of cold air would enter
the United States farther east, in the Great Lakes region or the
Northeast, or both. This year, under La Nina's influence, the
bulges have materialized farther west, and then the masses of cold
air behind them have drifted slowly to the east.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever the cold air has gone this winter, it has brought harsh
conditions. Chicago broke a single-day snowfall record for the city
with 18.6 inches of snow Jan. 2. Buffalo, which styles itself the
nation's snow capital, received a record five feet of snow in two
weeks earlier this month. Indiana set an all-time low-temperature
record of minus 36 degrees Fahrenheit. Three feet of snow fell on
South Bend.
</P>
<P>
   In the east, between the periodic arrivals of cold air drifting
in from the west, the weather has often stayed unseasonably warm _
as in New York's ``January thaw.'' From time to time, the country
as a whole warmed up as the Alaskan high-pressure system broke
down. The jet stream, no longer having to surge far to the north as
it climbed over the high, resumed a more or less straight
west-to-east course, wafting warm Pacific air clear across the
continent.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Alaskan high would build up again, and the exaggerated
southward bulge of cold air would come once more.
</P>
<P>
   The other major effects of La Nina, Bell said, have been mostly
in the tropics. For instance, there have been good rains in
Indonesia, just the opposite of El Nino's drought last year. But La
Nina, he said, has also ``completely shut down'' rainfall in the
eastern tropical Pacific.

</P>
<P>
   DALLAS _ There's no use fighting it anymore, and they know it.
</P>
<P>
   They were the talk of the first half and the buzz at the
All-Star Game. Now, as the second half of the NHL season gets under
way, they are the odds-on favorite to win the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Getting a little ahead of ourselves, you say?
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary, Brian Skrudland and friends seem to welcome the
talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't see why not,'' the Dallas Stars center said after
Tuesday's practice for tonight's game with the Los Angeles Kings.
``If people want to put us there, we set ourselves to that
standard, so let's not disappoint anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's a guy in this dressing room who doesn't
believe we can win the Stanley Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   After a hot first half, the Stars were left with plenty of
reasons to believe.
</P>
<P>
   Their 61 points led the NHL, leaving them three better than East
leader Philadelphia and six ahead of Pacific Division and Western
Conference runner-up Phoenix. The 27 wins were matched only by
Toronto. In 43 games, Dallas lost just nine times, a league low.
</P>
<P>
   Four players _ center Mike Modano, defensemen Darryl Sydor and
Sergei Zubov, and goaltender Ed Belfour _ played in Sunday's
All-Star Game. Ken Hitchcock coached the North American team to the
win.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good.
</P>
<P>
   Now, back to business.
</P>
<P>
   ``For our older players, it was really beneficial,'' Hitchcock
said of the break. ``Toward the end, quite frankly, I think some of
our older guys were worn down a little.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it was fatigue or merely an overdue slump, Dallas
finished the first half on a sour note, going 2-4-1 over its last
seven games. The first five of those were on a grueling Western
road trip, but home losses to Vancouver and Toronto gave cause for
a little soul-searching during the weekend off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't playing our game, and that starts in our own
zone,'' said Sydor. ``We've got to get stronger and simplify our
game more and not get into a run-and-gun style.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Stars' game begins with aggressive checking and a
tight defense that has helped Belfour and backup Roman Turek
compile a 2.04 goals-against average, tied for third in the league
with Phoenix and trailing only Philadelphia and Buffalo. Despite
the offseason addition of winger Brett Hull (16 goals and 16
assists despite missing 10 games because of injury), this remains a
blue-collar, grind-it-out sort of team _ albeit it one with enough
Star power to smooth over a few rough edges.
</P>
<P>
   Sydor, enjoying a breakout season, leads all NHL defensemen in
scoring (36 points, including 24 assists, 21 of those on power
plays). The team's power play is the league's best, with a
22.8-percent success rate.
</P>
<P>
   Modano, the franchise golden boy who is earning a reputation as
a two-way player, is tied for seventh in assists with 31. Hull,
despite limited ice time, already has five game-winning goals.
Belfour's 2.05 goals-against average ranks fifth among goalies with
the required 720 minutes, and backup Turek (1.96) has been even
better.
</P>
<P>
   That sort of balance and consistency produced a 15-game unbeaten
steak between Dec. 6 and Jan. 6, during which Dallas won 12 times.
It also resulted in a road record (13-5-5) that has been almost as
good as the team's showing at Reunion Arena (14-4-2), where it has
played to capacity crowds almost every night.
</P>
<P>
   Not that this is a sudden turnaround, mind you. A year ago, the
Stars won the President's Trophy (awarded to the club with the best
regular-season record), finishing with franchise records in wins
(49) and points (109), but they would not add the more coveted
hardware. After losing center Joe Nieuwendyk to a torn anterior
cruciate ligament in the opening playoff game against San Jose,
Dallas took eventual Stanley Cup champion Detroit to six games in
the Western Conference finals before bowing out.
</P>
<P>
   With the offseason addition of Hull from St. Louis and the
return of Nieuwendyk (who actually had both ACLs repaired), the
Stars seemed to have bridged the gap with the two-time champion Red
Wings. Detroit's struggles with injuries and inconsistency only
appeared to further pry open the window of opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite the impressive first half, not everything has
gone exactly to plan.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk sat out the final five games with tendinitis in his
right knee. Voted Most Valuable Player by his teammates a year ago
despite the truncated playoff run, his health for the second half
is critical to a team that leans on him for scoring and leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt we're looking for some added scoring punch
from another line or a group of lines,'' he said. ``We all have a
responsibility. Certainly, I'm one of those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock, who watched his team's offense grind to a halt
against Detroit in Nieuwendyk's absence, is anxious to see if those
knees will hold up after some rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that position, that No. 2 hole, we need a good player at
center ice,'' Hitchcock said. ``Joe's the guy we want in that
position. He's going to have to be a good player for us, a strong
player night in, night out, if we want to go to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   Modano, Hull and Jere Lehtinen are the team's top three scorers,
and all play on the No. 1 line. Finding punch from the left wing
remains a concern as well.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder, then, that the coach with the league's best record
still calls his team ``a work in progress.''
</P>
<P>
   The work resumes tonight as the second half begins and the
stakes continue to rise. With all the talk of a spring celebration
comes a level of expectation the Stars have yet to experience since
moving to Dallas before the 1993-94 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second half of the season, it goes up another level,''
Hitchcock said. ``All the players here recognize that. If we stay
the same level we were at the first half, we're just going to be a
middle-rung hockey club.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to need some of our younger players stepping their
games up, and we're going to need a strong emotional content to our
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do that, we'll be good.''
</P>
<P>
   Better than last year's near miss against the Red Wings?
</P>
<P>
   That's the hope, at least.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the clock is running.
</P>
<P>
   Hull is 34 years old, and Belfour will turn 34 in April. Wingers
Pat Verbeek and Dave Reid will be 35 in May. Skrudland will be 36
this summer, while defenseman Craig Ludwig will be 38 in March, the
same month center Guy Carbonneau turns 39.
</P>
<P>
   For the Stars, then, the future is now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intensity, the talk around here, is starting to focus
itself on the playoffs,'' Skrudland said. ``We know it's a ways
down the road yet, but we want to talk Stanley Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not?
</P>
<P>
   Everyone else is.

CITING RESISTANCE, DELTA AIR WITHDRAWS FARE SURCHARGE
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By JANET PIORKO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines has withdrawn the $1 surcharge it imposed
earlier this month on one-way domestic flights purchased anywhere
but on its own Web site.
</P>
<P>
   An airline spokesman, Todd Clay, said Tuesday that the change
had been put into Delta's reservations system overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the airline had withdrawn the fee, he said, ``The
marketplace spoke, and we responded.''
</P>
<P>
   The fee had provoked an intense response from travel agents, who
book the vast majority of airline tickets and who contended that
its purpose was to entice customers away from them.
</P>
<P>
   In imposing the surcharge, Delta had cited increased costs of
distributing tickets. ``Consumers and consumer groups reacted very
negatively,'' said Dina Long, a spokeswoman for the American
Society of Travel Agents in Alexandria, Va. ``It was certainly seen
by us as being discriminatory against travelers, favoring one group
of travelers over another, and forcing consumers into purchasing
tickets in the way that is most convenient for Delta.''
</P>
<P>
   But a bigger reason for Tuesday's withdrawal may have been the
reluctance of any other airline to follow Delta's lead, thereby
putting Delta at a competitive disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Hanmer, a travel agent in Bartlesville, Okla., who had
criticized the surcharge when Delta imposed it two weeks ago, was
surprised but happy when she heard the news Tuesday. ``I'm pleased
that they listened to the public,'' she said, ``because Lord knows,
they don't listen to travel agents.'' Ms. Hanmer added that
passengers who had already paid the surcharge would not be be able
to obtain a refund. ``There's no chance,'' she said. ``Airlines
don't give back money easily.''
</P>
<P>
   AAA, the auto club and travel service, praised Delta's move.
``We believe that Delta has done the right thing,'' said Jack
Mannix, the organization's managing director for marketing and
industry relations. ``This demonstrates that they can and do listen
and respond to the concerns of others in the travel industry.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Murphy, an airline analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, remarked: ``Somebody the other day made a very good comment
that Delta should have done it in reverse _ put in a discount on
the Web site rather than a penalty'' on other bookings. ``Putting a
surcharge in is offensive to customers, whereas a discount would
be, I think, welcome,'' he added

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``Senators, she does have a story to tell,'' the
impeachment manager said politely, uttering one of the classic
understatements of the nation's past year of scandal overdrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wouldn't you at least like to see and hear from her?'' asked
the prosecutor, Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., his gentle drawl inviting
as he urged the Senate court to not be shy and to call Monica
Lewinsky as the key witness in the case against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   With the request for the much interrogated former intern at last
put before the court, House impeachment managers faced a Senate
very anxious about its own dignity. Instantly, repeatedly, the
managers promised it would be a bowdlerized, expurgated Ms.
Lewinsky summoned to testify, hardly the furtively tape-recorded,
uninhibited storyteller already making some senators cringe in
anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   ``At no point,'' the managers emphasized, would questions about
``explicit sexual relations with the president'' be asked or
answered in the august chamber. No sex, no way, they vowed.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate court only listened, as silent as ever, its dignity
intact for Tuesday at least, as the members went into closed
session to consider the request. Before that, as the president's
lawyers argued the issue with the House managers for four hours,
the Senate's attentiveness level certainly seemed to increase at
each utterance of Ms. Lewinsky's name and the prosecution claim
that she still had some story left to tell.
</P>
<P>
   The trial was approaching the heart of the matter, whether to
venture in search of fresh revelations from the famously talkative
young woman with whom the president misbehaved. Senators did not
quite brace themselves in unison, but some could be seen variously
fighting smiles and grimaces during the debate.
</P>
<P>
   There was a stir as the impeachment managers reminded the Senate
of the early cover story that Clinton was only ``ministering to a
troubled person'' in his dealings with Ms. Lewinsky. This brought
openly mirthful glances of disbelief on the Republican side, as if
in nostalgia at recalling one of the oldie-goldie tabloid show
stoppers of the scandal story.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Democrats tended to wax glum across the way, especially when
``the genie of discovery'' was invoked as a force likely to follow
into the chamber close upon any appearance by Ms. Lewinsky. As on
most trial days, Minority Leader Tom Daschle had a look of brooding
watchfulness as he took all this in.
</P>
<P>
   The senator seemed a match for the poker-faced stoicism of Bruce
Lindsey over at the defense counsel table _ the White House lawyer
who has yet to address the trial and, so, is doubly fascinating for
his silence. For he is Clinton's closest friend and confidant, the
president's midnight card-playing crony, a sought after witness
himself in the early impeachment sparring. As he takes notes and
confers at the defense table, Lindsey is widely assumed to be the
president's alter ego at the trial, the premier source of what
Clinton needs to know after each day's session.
</P>
<P>
   As the senators sat mutely through their eleventh day in
judgment of the president, the chamber's level of focus remained
noteworthy. Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, could be seen leaning and
staring in laser-like delight at the prosecutor's performance of
Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark. The senator nodded emphatically and
slapped his chair arm as Hutchinson drove home contentions about
Clinton's impeachability. At the end, Gramm could not help breaking
his rule of silence, sending a popping sound about the chamber as
he enthusiastically slapped his right fist into his left palm, as
if he had just witnessed a flawless baseball pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimate verdicts aside, many senators clearly are savoring the
sheer performance level of the vying attorneys. Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., leans back and grins appreciatively at the poor-mouth
strategems of the chief prosecutor, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sort of think we have fallen short in the respect side,''
Hyde told the Senate on Monday, fairly bowing and scraping as he
spoke as a humble visitor from the House, ``the other body, kind of
blue collar people.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tuesday, David Kendall, the president's personal lawyer, scored
points in senators' smiles of appreciation as he turned several of
the prosecutors' own past words against them in having previously
assured the House there was no need for witnesses. He belittled the
impeachment managers in quick order as desperate blackjack players,
a programmed barbershop chorus fruitlessly hoping for something
fresh to turn up. Kendall triggered a bipartisan guffaw when he
quickly added, beaming in all insincerity : ``I don't want to be
uncharitable to the House managers.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde closed out the public debate by complaining that Kendall's
side has a ``positive allergy'' to fact witnesses, preferring
professional academics by the polished tablefuls. ``You know what
an intellectual is,'' said Hyde, his trial shtik well honed by now.
``It's someone who's educated beyond his intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   Various senators appreciated the chance to smile, even leer
before they once more were sealed within the chamber for their own
less amusing deliberations about summoning Ms. Lewinsky.

 &HT;    The matchup: Davis and the Falcons D
 &HT;    By Andy Clendennen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ This is the matchup everyone is waiting
to see.
</P>
<P>
   No, Dan Reeves and Mike Shanahan aren't going to lace up the
gloves and go a few rounds.
</P>
<P>
   But NFL Most Valuable Player Terrell Davis vs. the heralded run
defense of the Falcons could be just as entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons allowed an average of 75 rushing yards a game this
season. Atlanta has also held 12 teams under 100 rushing yards this
year, and the Falcons ranked fourth in fewest points allowed with
289, or 18.1 per game.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, meanwhile, rushed for 2,008 yards, had 11 100-yard games
and scored 21 touchdowns. He also averaged 5.1 yards per carry, and
his rushing touchdowns are more than every single team in the NFL
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Something will give, but Davis isn't taking a different approach
just because the Falcons have one of the best defenses in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel pressure, to be honest with you,'' Davis said.
``I try to keep things simple. Going through a game with me is
playing as hard as I can, doing what the coaches ask me to and
keeping things simple. Doing those things, I think good things
happen and that's been my key as long as I've been playing and so
far it's been working.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what kind of game it is. It could be a
championship game or a regular-season game, I tend to just stick
with the same thing and it seems to get me through, so we'll stick
with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Chances are that the Falcons will stick with what got them here
_ a defensive line that is small but quick, a solid corps of
linebackers and an extremely strong secondary.
</P>
<P>
   But Davis is mainly concerned with the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are just very quick up front,'' Davis said. ``They don't
have particularly big players up front. They remind me a lot of our
defense. They have a lot of speed on the front and they are very
talented in what they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``They play their gaps well and are very disciplined, and people
like that are very hard to run against. The teams that I have faced
throughout the years, those are the teams that are very hard to run
against.''
</P>
<P>
   And a strong defense is what Broncos coach Mike Shanahan calls
the highest accolade one can give a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at their rushing defense, and they're ranked second
in the NFL,'' Shanahan said. ``To me, the biggest compliment you
can give a team is say they have a (good) rushing defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this game you have two great defensive teams who have the
opportunity to shut down anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   A big key to the success of Davis and the rushing offense may be
the play of fullback Howard Griffith.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't catch a lot of passes, he doesn't get many carries,
but he may play the most important role on Super Bowl Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Howard Griffith is a guy who is an unsung hero,'' Shanahan
said. ``He doesn't carry the ball many times, he doesn't catch the
ball many times, therefore a lot of people don't know him. But our
football players all know him and he's one of those guys that comes
to play every week, and he's just had an exceptional year.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's OK with his role on the team, a role overshadowed by
such offensive stars as John Elway, Shannon Sharpe, Rod Smith, Ed
McCaffrey and Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very comfortable with it,'' Griffith said. ``Lead blocking
is something that I've become accustomed to and I take a lot of
pride in. It's one of the things I have to do if I want to make
this team go, so it's something I take a lot of pride in doing for
the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously a challenge, going against a defense like we're
going against. It's going to be a challenge going out and executing
our gameplan to the best of our ability. They're going to make some
plays, but as long as we can stay on schedule and not get caught in
a 2nd and 10, we'll be fine. We have to choose our opportunities.''

 &HT;    Pros give teens tips for turning dreams into musical success
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sixteen-year-old Bryan Taylor wants to be a singer
when he graduates from East Point's Tri-Cities High School (Ga.),
kind of like the guy who is the falsetto in Boyz II Men. But he
didn't have a clue about how to get from singing around the house
to the cover of a compact disc _ until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was one of 700 students from 21 metro high schools who
got a crash course in how to break into the music business at
Grammy in the Schools, a daylong seminar sponsored by the Atlanta
chapter of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (the
folks who bring us the Grammys).
</P>
<P>
   Students, chosen by teachers and counselors for their interest
in music, got to hear from some of the city's top industry
insiders, such as producer Rico Wade (Outkast, Goodie Mob),
engineer Phil Tan (Usher, Mariah Carey, TLC, Jermaine Dupri) and
video producer Fred Taylor (``The Dip''). The hard-work message was
fairly consistent: ``You can't just buy a keyboard and make money;
you may have to cut some grass,'' advised Wade. But panelists also
helped students understand what the word business means when it
comes to making music.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, all they see is the glamour side of the
business, but they don't see all the work,'' said Charles Driebe,
an Atlanta entertainment lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   As students realized they were brushing shoulders with heavy
hitters, hands shot up throughout the Rialto Center for the
Performing Arts.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do I copyright a song I've written?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why does a musician need an attorney?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be a gospel singer, but how do I get started?''
</P>
<P>
   Students also were able to attend sessions on songwriting,
composition, artist management, interactive media, entertainment
law, publishing and public relations. With his black cashmere coat,
shaved head and cast of famous friends, Wade captured most of the
attention, which seemed to be a bit of a deja vu experience for the
hot young producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's inspiring to look out there and see these kids, because
they look just like me,'' he said, recalling his childhood as an
aspiring musician in southwest Atlanta. ``They are imagining and
dreaming, just like I was when I was that age. It makes me feel
like I have a purpose in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Wade also ended up giving Bryan, the sophomore from Tri-Cities,
the tryout of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you sing?'' the producer asked from the stage, after
Taylor asked how to get ``discovered.'' Bryan shouted back yeah,
grabbed a microphone and belted out Jagged Edge's ``I Got to Be''
as students gave him a roaring response.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never sung in public before,'' Bryan said after the
session. ``But I've learned that it's not just the singing. You've
got to work and get an education too.''
</P>

POPE SPEAKS ON MORALITY, BUT NOT CLINTON'S 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also POPE-CLINTON, POPE-EXORCISM, POPE-JEWS) 
(lb) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Ignoring the moral lapses of President Clinton, Pope
John Paul II flew into in St. Louis on Tuesday and addressed the
broader moral failings of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In a crowded airport hangar, the pope referred to the infamous
1857 Dred Scott case affirming slavery, which was heard in St.
Louis, and called it a ``time of testing,'' which the United States
failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``America faces a similar time of trial today,'' the pope said.
``Today the conflict is between a culture that affirms, cherishes
and celebrates the gift of life and a culture that seeks to declare
entire groups of human beings _ the unborn, the terminally ill, the
handicapped, and others considered `unuseful' _ to be outside the
boundaries of legal protection.''
</P>
<P>
   The president and Mrs. Clinton greeted the pope, who shook hands
with them briefly before turning his attention to the cheers and
the outstretched hands from the first row of seats. He blessed
2,000 people _ mainly Roman Catholic families with young children,
selected by their parishes _ and bent over to pat a small child.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who guided the fragile pope down a red carpet with a
protective hand on his elbow, smiled broadly and introduced him to
people in the audience like a solicitous host.
</P>
<P>
   The entire world had been tut-tutting about the uneasy
juxtaposition of the highest moral authority of the Catholic Church
shaking hands with an American president on trial for lying about
extramarital sex. Clinton looked completely at ease. And the pope
was unlikely to be shaken by Clinton's noisy scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican's main concern was that the pope's message to
Americans not be drowned out by the awkward iconography of the
moment. The Clinton scandal all but obliterated news of the pope's
visit to Cuba in January last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only a higher moral vision can motivate the choice for life,''
the pope said to strong applause. ``And the values underlying that
vision will greatly depend on whether this nation continues to
honor and revere the family as the basic unit of society.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the two leaders sat in a small room on white
armchairs for photographs before their 20-minute meeting. They
exchanged a few words, and Clinton told reporters he was planning
his own trip to Mexico soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to increase the involvement of the United States,'' he
said, words that seemed aimed at pleasing his guest, who throughout
his stay in Mexico repeatedly reminded the United States of its
responsibility to poorer nations in Latin America. ``I am looking
forward to hearing what the holy father has to say about his
trip,'' Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican has often expressed its opposition to some areas of
U.S. policy, including abortion, land mines, the death penalty and
the bombing of Iraq. The pope's prepared text had references to
those issues, but he skipped over them in his speech. Vatican
officials said that even in private the pope was unlikely to raise
issues on which the disagreements between Washington and the
Vatican are deep, longstanding and well known.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the White house said the two men discussed the need for
continental solidarity and stressed the role of the United States.
The pope praised U.S. efforts to help victims in Central America,
as well as to promote religious freedom in totalitarian countries.
The pope alluded to abortion by stressing the need to protect all
human life.
</P>
<P>
   They also discussed Mexico and Cuba. The Vatican spokesman,
Joaquin Navarro-Vals, said they did not discuss the Monica Lewinsky
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said the pope told Clinton that he ``and all
American leaders'' were in his prayers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Vatican was fully aware ahead of time that Missouri had
decided to postpone the execution of a death-row inmate while the
pope was in St. Louis. The pope apparently did not mention it. On
the plane from Mexico, the pope's spokesman described the
postponement as a ``mockery.''
</P>
<P>
   John Paul II had just spent four days in Mexico engulfed by
adoring crowds who lined up by the tens of thousands along his
motorcade routes and camped out overnight in front of the Vatican's
diplomatic residence in Mexico City, where the pope stayed,
serenading him all through the night. The thin welcome at the St.
Louis airport was starkly different.
</P>
<P>
   For security reasons, crowds had been discouraged from going to
the airport, and the sidewalks along the motorcade route into the
city were empty. By the time the pope reached Kiel Center, a huge
indoor sports arena for basketball and ice hockey, to address a
youth rally, the city warmed up.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul II urged the youths to train for their vocation as
Catholics the way Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa would train for the
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a really awe-inspiring guy,'' said Sean Asher, 15, who
drove in with his Catholic youth group from Springfield, Mo. ``You
gotta see him in person _ pictures just aren't enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who did not attend the rally, flew back to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The pope has had three meetings with Clinton. They were always
cordial, but neither Washington nor the Vatican claims their
relationship to be anything more than that. If anything, it may be
less; Clinton dismayed the Vatican when he took communion at a Mass
in Soweto, South Africa, in March last year. The pope did not say
anything about it publicly, but Cardinal John O'Connor, archbishop
of New York, expressed his disapproval openly and firmly.
</P>
<P>
   Vatican officials have never publicly discussed the Lewinsky
affair or Clinton's impeachment trial. The Vatican newspaper
Osservatore Romano has run only one article on the scandal, a
neutral report the day he was impeached.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, Vatican officials make the same kind of jokes about
the scandal as officials and diplomats in other European capitals.
But church leaders have not entirely hidden their disapproval from
their followers. Avvenire, the daily newspaper of the Italian
Catholic bishops' conference, has printed regular reports. A few
have quite vividly expressed deep disapproval of the American
president and the voters who continue to support him.
</P>
<P>
   As a columnist for Avvenire, Romanello Cantini, put it in July:
``Unfortunately, the average American, converted by widespread
permissiveness and complete indifference to what goes on in the
private domain, no longer seems to be shaken by old-fashioned
puritan indignation. The majority of Americans believe that Clinton
has lied but that he is above all a simpatico Pinocchio who must be
forgiven that his nose is growing at least as long as the economy
grows alongside it.''

 &HT;    Chop-block technique common, linemen say
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Much has been made of the ``seal-blocking'' techniques
taught by Denver Broncos offensive line coach Alex Gibbs and
responsible, many observers feel, for the success of tailback
Terrell Davis. One national magazine recently detailed the manner
in which the frontside blockers rotate opposing defensive linemen
sideways, much like setting a ``pick'' in basketball. The backside
blockers allow the defense to pursue the play laterally, then use
their momentum to cut down would-be tacklers.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday, the Denver linemen insisted there is nothing
revolutionary about the tactics employed by Gibbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing new under the sun in the NFL,'' right tackle
Harry Swayne said. ``We do what good offensive lines do. We come
off the ball hard. We try to punch you under the chin. We try to
get away with as much as they'll let us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos have been accused by some teams of using the same
cut-block techniques taught by San Francisco line coach Bobb
McKittrick. Those schemes have made McKittrick a despised coach in
several NFL cities.
</P>
<P>
   Center Tom Nalen stressed that the Broncos emphasize some
techniques in which the defenders are lured away from the play,
then legally chopped when they turn back to pursue the
misdirection. Guard Mark Schlereth politely noted that everyone is
seeking a reason why the NFL's lightest line unit (average 286
pounds) is so good. ``Instead of looking for all these reasons for
our success, people should acknowledge we're pretty good,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   They also block . . .
</P>
<P>
   The Denver offensive linemen splurged at Joe's Stone Crab on
Monday night and it turns out the group invited a couple hangers-on
to attend. Both fullbacks, starter Howard Griffith and backup
Detron Smith, accompanied the blockers. ``For just one night, they
had linemen status bestowed on them,'' tackle Tony Jones said.
``But the expiration date has expired now. They're back to being
just fullbacks.'' In postscript to the dinner, paid for with the
kangaroo court fines the linemen collect during the season, backup
center K.C. Jones was penalized $500 for revealing the plans in
advance to the media. ``Because of him, the place was crawling with
TV cameras,'' guard Dan Neil said.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for work
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator Greg Robinson is sympathetic to the plight
of minority coaches, who have had problems securing head coach
opportunities. But Robinson made it clear he someday wants to be a
head coach, and said all hires should be made on merit. ``I
understand perfectly what the league and commissioner (Paul)
Tagliabue are trying to do in calling attention to the minority
problem. It's something that desperately needs to be addressed. But
I feel like I've earned consideration, too.'' In each of the last
two seasons, Robinson's name has been mentioned on the grapevine.
</P>
<P>
   Piece of the action
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback John Elway continues to leave the door open, just
barely, on his possible return in 1999. But when Elway does retire,
speculation is that Broncos owner Patrick Bowlen might invite him
to become a minority partner in the franchise. ``I know he does not
want to be a coach,'' Bowlen said. ``But I think he wants to work
here. I think that he probably wants to be a part of the ownership
group and I would welcome him.'' Elway certainly has the financial
wherewithal to buy into the Broncos. Last year he sold his six
Denver area car dealerships to Miami Dolphins owner Wayne Huizenga
for more than $87 million.
</P>
<P>
   The homeboy
</P>
<P>
   Broncos kicker Jason Elam, the former Brookwood High School star
from Snellville, allowed on Tuesday that it's ``a little strange''
facing the Falcons in the Super Bowl. ``I grew up a Falcons fan as
far back as I can remember,'' Elam said. ``I used to live and die
by what those guys did. Tim Mazzetti, Mick Luckhurst, Greg Davis,
Steve Bartkowski _ I remember them all. It's going to be tough to
root against them. It's going to be pretty special when we kick off
against them.''
</P>
<P>
   Inquiring minds
</P>
<P>
   Ever wonder if ``Barrel Man,'' the guy who comes to every
Broncos game dressed in a huge orange-and-blue barrel, has anything
on underneath? The Denver mascot, real name Tim McKernan, has
always claimed he was naked except for the barrel. But a curious
scribe who does not work for the Journal-Constitution caught a
sneak peek on Tuesday and issued this report: Bermuda shorts.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy system
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Ed McCaffrey, who was selected to the AFC Pro Bowl
squad, felt partner Rod Smith should have made the team as well. So
he's paying for Smith to accompany him to Hawaii for the game.
``The way I see it, he's one of the biggest reasons I made the
team,'' McCaffrey said. ``It's the least I could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Stat of the day
</P>
<P>
   There have been over 300 punts in Super Bowl history but none
has ever been returned for a touchdown. ``Let's keep it that way,''
Denver punter Tom Rouen said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos did not practice Tuesday because the the Media Day
activities, but will resume workouts this afternoon... Coach Mike
Shanahan imposed a 12:30 a.m. curfew on Tuesday for the next few
nights.
</P>
<P>
   The last word(s)
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe, who played at Savannah State, when asked what it might
be like to be covered Sunday by Falcons free safety Eugene
Robinson, a Colgate graduate: ``He can't out-talk me and he can't
cover me. Just because he went to Colgate, doesn't mean anything to
me. I don't have a degree from Harvard, but I can count to a
million.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Republican leaders on Tuesday took the
gamble that they can open the door to witnesses and yet still
somehow bring the trial of President Clinton to a relatively quick,
dignified and non-confrontational conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, and his
deputies have struggled to find a footing in the midst of powerful
political cross currents: the general public overwhelmingly wants
the impeachment drive to end, but the party's conservative base
demands that it move forward.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans have wondered just what loyalty they owe to
their colleagues in the House, who pulled them over the cliff once
before during the government shutdown of 1995-1996. And they wonder
what kind of precedents they are creating for history.
</P>
<P>
   With all these conflicting impulses in mind, Lott has now
arranged a middle ground for his party: to approve subpoenas for
just three witnesses (aside from a House request, which may be
ignored, that the Senate invite Clinton to testify), with sharply
limited questioning time that could bring the Senate to an end to
the trial by mid-February. Although some Republicans were still
wavering, Lott seemed likely to win when the Senate votes Wednesday
on whether to depose witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just trying to have a fair process here,'' the
Mississippi Republican said this week, ``but one that gets us to a
conclusion, as soon as possible, without rushing to judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott has been navigating his way through a caucus of many views,
not always following predictable ideological predilections.
Conservatives like James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, Wayne Allard of
Colorado and Don Nickles, the majority whip from Oklahoma, or
former House members like Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania have pushed
to support the House with a full trial and as many witnesses as the
prosecutors wanted, Republicans say.
</P>
<P>
   But moderates like Susan M. Collins of Maine and John H. Chafee
of Rhode Island have also argued for witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Shelby of Alabama, a usual ally of Lott's has been one
of the Republicans most skeptical about witnesses. And Richard
Lugar of Indiana, usually a centrist, has been mostly quiet in
caucus, Republicans say, but sounded fierce on Tuesday when he
blamed the White House for any partisanship developing in the
Senate. ``The White House has stonewalled almost every opportunity
to inquire about the president's activities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To hold this group together and win a majority for witnesses,
Lott has steadily reined in the House prosecutors. They once wanted
to call 15 witnesses instead of the three they ultimately settled
for on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He thus has played almost the opposite role as the leadership in
the House. There Rep. Tom DeLay, the majority whip, aggressively
pushed impeachment forward, by cleverly pushing moderates to vote
for impeachment, by not allowing them an easy out through a censure
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   The House prosecutors made it clear on Tuesday they were less
than delighted. ``We have always believed and we still do believe
that 10 or 12 witnesses are what we should have, and should have
been permitted to call to prove our case,'' Rep. Bill McCollum,
R-Fla., said.

COACH'S PREPARATION MEETS OPPORTUNITY AT ARIZONA STATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
TEMPE, Ariz. _ In baseball, it's the trade that helps both teams.
In this particular college basketball story, it's the hire that
helped both schools.
<TEXT>
<P>
   About a year ago, when it was apparent that Texas A&AMP;M would
dismiss coach Tony Barone, the leading candidate was quickly
apparent. Rob Evans, the Mississippi coach who had been an
assistant at Texas Tech and Oklahoma State, seemed to be the
perfect fit.
</P>
<P>
   But, as often happens with the Aggies, ``negotiations broke
down.'' Instead of Evans, A&AMP;M wound up hiring Melvin Watkins of
North Carolina-Charlotte. Evans was hired at Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for Melvin and he's fabulous for Texas A&AMP;M,'' Evans
said after a recent Arizona State practice. ``It's something where
it really worked out for both of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have always worked out for me. I've always felt like
when I recruit a kid and I don't get him, the one I wind up with is
better. The man upstairs is looking out for me because this is a
great situation.''
</P>
<P>
   If you say so, Mr. Positive. Arizona State is recovering from a
point-shaving scandal that forced the resignation of coach Bill
Frieder two years ago. Don Newman, Frieder's interim replacement,
lasted one season before the school decided to hire a New Sheriff
to come in and clean up the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my view, Rob is someone who is very straightforward, a
stand-up professional,'' Arizona State athletic director Kevin
White said.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State's last conference championship came in 1973. The
Sun Devils have made two NCAA Tournament appearances in the past 17
seasons. The school's basketball tradition is as arid as the
climate.
</P>
<P>
   And that's another reason why Evans is a good fit here. He knows
all about winning at a school where the basketball history fits on
an index card. Compared with his former school, Arizona State is a
veritable North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   After a quarter of a century as an assistant coach, Evans got
his chance to be a head coach. He was handed the keys to
Mississippi's program in 1993. Few expected Evans to be seen or
heard from again.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got to Mississippi, that might have been the bleakest
situation I've seen,'' said Evans, 52. ``I took a pay cut. I was
making $70,000 and I was making more at Oklahoma State as an
assistant. The facilities were awful. Attendance was awful.''
</P>
<P>
   What Evans doesn't say is that he is a black man who was taking
over as coach at a school that has displayed a Confederate flag as
its symbol and has played ``Dixie'' as a ``fight'' song. Try to
recruit African-American players to a school with ``that'' baggage.
</P>
<P>
   In his final two seasons the Rebels won 42 games and twice
finished on top of the Southeastern Conference West Division. Evans
proved that he could build something out of very little.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils are 11-8 overall and 3-4 in the Pacific-10. Evans
is trying to build his program's foundation by emphasizing defense
and discipline. Arizona State's gambling scandal, he said, ``was no
factor'' as the Sun Devils signed an impressive recruiting class in
November.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Arizona State is one of the few schools, probably one
of 20, that has the chance to win the national championship,''
Evans said. ``It may never happen. But you've got the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the A&AMP;M job was a good situation and possibility for
me. The new facility, the location ... I thought there were three
or four jobs in the country that were ones I would leave Ole Miss
for, and A&AMP;M was one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State, it turned out, was also on that list.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Efforts by the conservative and reform Jewish
movements to gain official recognition in Israel suffered a setback
Tuesday when the Israeli Parliament passed a bill intended to bar
non-orthodox Jews from the country's powerful religious councils.
</P>
<P>
   Although the bill's practical effect is still to be tested, it
has fueled the debate on religious pluralism in Israel and on the
role of religion in the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the small conservative and reform movements here, who
have been been chipping away at the orthodox control of religious
affairs in Israel, warned that the legislation would cause a rift
with Jews abroad, most of whom are not orthodox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am deeply concerned that this legislation will alienate
diaspora Jewry, two-thirds of the Jewish people, from the state of
Israel,'' said Rabbi Ehud Bandel, president of the conservative
movement in Israel. ``The Parliament has said that there is only
one legitimate Judaism in Israel: Orthodox Judaism.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel's Sephardic chief rabbi lashed out at the Reform
movement, saying it had led to the loss of more Jews by
assimilation than in the Holocaust. ``We know that the one-way
street sanctioning assimilation is the Reform system, the Reform
conversion, the Reform synagogue,'' said the rabbi, Eliahu
Bakshi-Doron.
</P>
<P>
   The government-sponsored bill was proposed by the strictly
orthodox United Torah Judaism party to counter Supreme Court
rulings that conservative and reform Jews should be included in
religious councils, traditionally an orthodox preserve.
</P>
<P>
   The state-financed councils in cities and towns serve both
religious and secular Israelis, running marriage bureaus and burial
societies, maintaining synagogues and ritual baths and supervising
kosher inspections at restaurants and shops.
</P>
<P>
   Facing the prospect that strictly orthodox lawmakers would block
approval of the state budget if the councils bill was not passed,
the governing coalition of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
mustered just enough votes to pass the bill 50 to 49, with one
abstention. Suspended budget discussions resumed after the vote,
which followed a stormy debate that lasted late into Monday night
and ended Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   A crucial yes vote was cast by Yitzhak Mordechai, the former
Israeli defense minister, who was recently dismissed by Netanyahu.
Running for prime minister at the helm of a new centrist party,
Mordechai is courting orthodox support in the Israeli elections set
for May.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Uri Regev, a leader of the Reform movement in Israel,
called the legislation ``a slap in the face.'' As head of the
movement's Israel Religious Action Center, Regev has waged a decade
of court battles to seat reform and conservative Jews on the
councils.
</P>
<P>
   Designed to exclude non-orthodox Jews, the bill passed Tuesday
requires council members to pledge that they will abide by rulings
of the Chief Rabbinate and of local rabbinates.
</P>
<P>
   But reform and conservative representatives say that they are
willing to acknowledge the Chief Rabbinate's authority in matters
of Jewish law, and are prepared to make the pledge in order to
serve on the councils.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will make the pledge required by law, though our
interpretation of it might be different that that intended by the
lawmakers,'' said Bandel, who is a designated member of the
Jerusalem religious council.
</P>
<P>
   But Bandel and his colleagues are sure to run into resistance
from orthodox council members, who have boycotted recent council
meetings in the cities of Haifa and Tel Aviv to avoid having to sit
with conservative and reform representatives. The religious council
in Jerusalem has not even been called into session, and the
conservative and reform movements have gone to court to demand that
it be convened.
</P>
<P>
   The interior and religious affairs minister, Eliahu Suissa, a
member of the strictly orthodox Sephardic Shas party, is leading
the resistance to the court-ordered integration of the councils. He
warned on Monday that he would resign rather than violate Jewish
law or the injunctions of the chref rabbis. He has also ordered the
appointment next month of new religious councils with fewer members
in an effort to restrict he number of non-orthodox representatives.
Bakshi-Doron has called for the abolition of the religious councils
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Defiance of court orders to integrate the councils is a
religious imperative, argued Avraham Laserson, a lawmaker from
United Torah Judaism. ``Matters that are sacrosanct in Judaism are
not subject at all to the authority of the court,'' he told
Parliament Tuesday.

 &HT;    Republicans cut potential witness list to 3; Currie not
includedBy Mark Sherman and Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republican prosecutors whittled their
proposed witness list to three Tuesday to focus on obstruction of
justice charges against President Clinton and to coax a reluctant
Senate to extend the impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors also ``made a rather gentle request,'' in the
words of prosecutor Rep. Asa Hutchinson (R-Ark.) that senators
invite Clinton to submit, under oath, to another round of questions
about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky and attempts to conceal
it. White House aides quickly ruled out an appearance by the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Under a measure that the Senate will vote on today, Lewinsky,
Clinton friend Vernon Jordan and presidential aide Sidney
Blumenthal would answer questions from prosecutors and Clinton's
defense team in the presence of a senator from both parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Witnesses help you. They won't help me,'' Rep. Henry Hyde
(R-Ill.) told senators. ``I'm satisfied a compelling case is here
for the removal of the president.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest surprise was that Oval Office secretary Betty
Currie, who plays a critical role in two of the seven obstruction
of justice counts, was not included on the list. Hyde, the lead
prosecutor, said there is already enough from her in the record.
</P>
<P>
   David Kendall, Clinton's personal lawyer, scoffed at the need
for witnesses in a presentation to the Senate that was laced with
sarcasm. ``We know what they're going to say,'' Kendall said of the
proposed witnesses, ``because it's all right there in the volumes
before you.''
</P>
<P>
   Comparing the prosecutors to Mr. Micawber in David Copperfield,
Kendall said that they keep hoping something new will turn up.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't know what it is, but they believe they'll know it
when they see it,'' Kendall said.
</P>
<P>
   He also warned senators that if they let the ``genie'' out of
the bottle, White House lawyers would need ample time to examine
evidence they have not yet seen and prepare for witnesses they
might call in Clinton's defense.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall sparred with the House team during an afternoon session
that at times resembled a ``did too, did not'' spat.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said the White House is afraid of witnesses. We are
not, Kendall said. Are too, Rep. Bill McCollum (R-Fla.) said in
closing the debate.
</P>
<P>
   In arguing for witnesses, the prosecutors acknowledged that they
had wanted to ask for more witnesses _ up to 18, according to Hyde.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they were settling for ``a pitiful three,'' Hyde said,
because senators left little doubt that they would reject a lengthy
list of witnesses and seek to end the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we made such a request, it would not be approved,''
McCollum said.
</P>
<P>
   The prospective witnesses, and the issues prosecutors said they
would explore, indicate that they will emphasize the article of
impeachment charging Clinton with obstructing justice over the
article that alleges the president testified falsely to a federal
grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cover six of the elements of obstruction,'' Hutchinson
said, explaining how prosecutors decided which names to include.
</P>
<P>
   At least two Republican senators, Susan Collins of Maine and
Gordon Smith of Oregon, and two Democrats, Bob Graham of Florida
and Russell Feingold of Wisconsin, have said that they consider the
obstruction charge the stronger of the two. Conviction on either
article, which requires a two-thirds vote in the Senate, would be
sufficient to remove Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   The House prosecutors argued that the witnesses would remove any
doubts that the senators might have about the case against Clinton
by injecting live voices into the case, which has so far been told
by depositions and video and audio tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Today's vote, if successful, still would defer a decision on
whether to call any of the witnesses to the floor of the Senate for
live testimony. One possibility under discussion would involve
videotaping the witnesses' testimony in private sessions with the
lawyers, then making the tapes available to senators.
</P>
<P>
   The House prosecutors also asked permission to introduce three
pieces of evidence that weren't in the official House impeachment
record used so far during the trial:
</P>
<P>
   _ An affidavit from Barry Ward, the clerk for U.S. District
Judge Susan Webber Wright who oversaw the Paula Jones sexual
harassment lawsuit against the president. Prosecutors said Ward
attended Clinton's deposition in the Jones case and observed a key
moment in the testimony in which presidential lawyers contend
Clinton was not paying attention. Ward testified the president was
attentive, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   _ An affidavit from T. Wesley Holmes, a lawyer for Mrs. Jones,
who testified that the Jones lawyers had subpoenaed Oval Office
secretary Betty Currie as a witness in their case in January 1998,
around the time Clinton had summoned his secretary to his office
and gone over his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. Clinton has said
he wasn't tampering with Ms. Currie because he had no reason to
believe she would be a witness in any proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   _ Records of telephone calls between Ms. Lewinsky and the
president, including a Dec. 6, 1997, call that lasted 56 minutes.
The call occurred around the time Ms. Lewinsky was emerging as a
possible witness in the Jones case.

 &HT;    Three qualify as potential jurors in dragging death case
 &HT;    By Zach Maxwell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ Prosecutors and defense attorneys in the capital
murder trial of John William King interviewed 10 potential jurors
Tuesday, but qualified only three for a final pool from which they
will select the 12 jurors and two alternates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three out of 10 won't get us there,'' Jasper County District
Attorney Guy James Gray said after the third session of questioning
Tuesday. He said simply finding a jury to decide the fate of King,
accused in the June 1998 dragging death of James Byrd Jr., ``has
always been a concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the seven excused from jury duty, four were steadfastly
against the death penalty, one had a prior conviction for
shoplifting and another said their opinion in the matter was
already set.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential juror revealed he was related to Michelle
Chapman, who received letters from King while he was in jail and
has been subpoenaed to testify in the trial. The DA's office filed
a list of 48 subpoenas last week, including a man from Diboll,
Steven Potter. Potter's relation to the case was not known.
</P>
<P>
   Gray showed confidence that a jury of Jasper County residents
would be set, even if it becomes necessary to dip into jury pools
from other county court jury lists.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning session, one of three people from the 122-member
jury pool _ a black woman whose husband is a Jasper County
sheriff's deputy _ made the cut.
</P>
<P>
   James Byrd Sr., the father of the 49-year-old killed in a
possibly racially-motivated hate crime, attended the morning
session.
</P>
<P>
   Five people were interviewed in an early afternoon session.
Three were dispatched within 10 minutes for their qualms against
the death penalty. The fourth was subjected to lengthy
back-and-forth questioning from Gray and defense attorney Brack
Jones. He and a postal worker, both white men, completed the day's
qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
   Two more men were excused from duty in a short 3 p.m. session,
again for their stands on the death penalty. One of the men quoted
the Bible (``Thou shalt not kill.'') on a lengthy questionnaire
distributed to potential jurors Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're moving faster than expected,'' Gray said. ``Six were
disqualified in a heartbeat. That speeds things up.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the anti-death penalty theme of the day was to be
expected in Jasper, a deeply religious town of 8,000 in the East
Texas piney woods, but called the disqualifications a ``statistical
blurp.''
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge Joe Bob Golden issued an order to the jury
pool to steer clear of a cable television special on the killing
that aired Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Potential jurors were interviewed one-by-one, with an audience
of mostly news media in the courthouse gallery. King wore an
untucked black and white checkered shirt concealing a stun belt,
occasionally laughed at banter with his attorneys, and made a point
to scan the gallery before taking his seat at the start of the
day's final session.

 &HT;    Minister's trial focuses on where donations went
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEARWATER, Fla. _ When the burning of black Southern churches
began to sink into the nation's conscience 30 months ago, the
Anti-Defamation League rose as a voice against the evil. Even more,
with the resources of a national fund-raising campaign, the
organization offered itself to black pastors as a source of seed
money for new rural churches.
</P>
<P>
   To spread the word _ and the money _ the ADL turned to the Rev.
Henry Lyons, who had become familiar to legions of black Christians
as president of the National Baptist Convention USA.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of funding the reconstruction of burned churches,
Lyons gave away only a fraction of the $244,500 and devoted the
rest to personal matters like savings accounts, his waterfront home
and various women across the country, state prosectuors said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   During the first day of testimony in his trial for alleged
racketeering, grand theft and money laundering, Lyons watched a
parade of rural black Baptists from Alabama say they received far
less than the $35,000 apiece Lyons told the ADL he had donated.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged fraud against the ADL is a small part of a
multimillion-dollar conspiracy Lyons masterminded by selling his
name and the reputation of the National Baptist Convention,
according to state attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1996, three Alabama pastors flew from Birmingham to
Atlanta where they met Lyons and traveled as a group to New York
City for an ADL meeting. During a videotaped ceremony, Lyons was
given a check for $225,000.
</P>
<P>
   One of the three pastors, the Rev. Levi Pickens, who was missing
his right leg but refused to use a wheelchair, was chosen to
address the Jewish group, according to Tuesday's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning from prosectors, Pickens said he didn't
mention to ADL members that his church had been rebuilt months
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Another in the trio, the Rev. Arthur Coleman, testified Tuesday
that Lyons instructed Pickens ``to make it seem a little, you know,
make it seem a little badder, really ... something along that
line.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyons first met officials from the Anti-Defamation League _
national director Abraham Foxman and top volunteer Howard Berkowitz
_ as part of the U.S. delegation sent to Israel after the
assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   When black Southern churches became a public issue in 1996, the
ADL turned to Lyons as a conduit for its donations solicited from
ads in The Washington Post, The New York Times and The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, ADL official Mark Medin testified Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a follow-up letter to the Anti-Defamation League, Lyons
informed the group he had made donations to several Alabama
churches of $35,000 each. Prosecutors showed the letter to Medin,
who confirmed it was from the ADL's files.
</P>
<P>
   The group never authorized Lyons to use the money to redecorate
his house, pay a credit card, give to his wife or put in his
savings account, Medin said under questioning from prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Within two weeks after receiving $225,000 from the ADL, Lyons
called back to thank the group for its contribution and said, ``If
there are any further funds, please think of the National Baptist
Convention,'' former ADL official Amy Goldstein testified.
</P>
<P>
   She said she told Lyons an accounting of the first check might
help secure more money for the NBC. Within 48 hours, a letter from
Lyons arrived explaining who had received the money, including
several $35,000 payoffs to churches.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from four churches mentioned in the letter
testified Tuesday they never received that large a payment, though
some said their churches got $10,000 for capital improvements and
another $3,000 for the pastor.
</P>
<P>
   The ADL suspected something was amiss when journalists and state
investigators started calling.
</P>
<P>
   When the ADL asked for an explanation, Lyons' attorney sent a
letter stating that the donations were in an escrow account and
would be returned. Prosecutors submitted that letter into evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Later Tuesday, prosecution witnesses detailed negotiations that
resulted in a credit card deal Lyons tried to arrange with a
Memphis bank. The talks started when a Texas communications
businessman was approached by an NBC representative to design a
prepaid phone card with a picture of Lyons.
</P>
<P>
   That evolved into a credit card scam that resulted in Union
Planters of Memphis losing $300,000 to Lyons, prosecutors said in
their opening statement.
</P>
<P>
   Detailed testimony about that deal, as well as one with a
funeral supply company and a life insurance corporation, is
forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   When court recessed Tuesday, one juror hinted that she might
lose her job because of the length of the trial, expected to last
at least a month.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Susan Schaeffer advised the juror to consult an attorney,
since an employer cannot legally fire a worker because of jury
duty. Schaeffer said she was contemplating a criminal contempt
charge against the employer, who was not identified.Marlon Manuel

 &HT;    BellSouth releases plans for office complex
 &HT;    By Sallye Salter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ BellSouth's estimated $750 million program to build
three large office centers in Midtown and Buckhead will relocate
most of its metro Atlanta employees to within walking distance of
MARTA transit stations. At the same time, the project will deal a
blow to the suburban office space market. The company will vacate 2
million square feet in the suburbs while it builds 3 million square
feet in the city.
</P>
<P>
   In Midtown, BellSouth plans to build three buildings of 350,000
square feet each on the seven-acre site of the vacant First Baptist
Church at Fourth and Peachtree. The telecommunications company has
offered to give the sanctuary building to the Atlanta Symphony
Orchestra for a concert hall. The new BellSouth office would be
near the North Avenue MARTA station and a block from the 1
million-square-foot BellSouth Center at 675 West Peachtree.
</P>
<P>
   The Midtown land was part of several blocks assembled by a
Swedish investor in the 1980s for a massive high-density
development. It is now owned by a Swedish lender of the developer
who went bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   At Lenox Park in Buckhead, north of the Lenox MARTA station,
BellSouth will buy 12 acres. The company will build three office
buildings containing a total of 640,000 square feet alongside three
existing office buildings containing 360,000 square feet. The site
is zoned for one additional building.
</P>
<P>
   At the Lindbergh MARTA station, BellSouth will construct two
500,000-square-foot office buildings that will be developed by
Carter &AMP; Associates as part of a retail-office-residential-hotel
complex on land leased from MARTA. Carter is also developing
BellSouth's other two centers.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth's consolidation, which will put 17,000 of its 19,000
employees within I-285 by 2003, is the second such plan unveiled by
Atlanta-based corporate giants this month. Two weeks ago, Coca-Cola
Co. said it is working on a consolidation plan to relocate 2,500
employees from the suburbs and Midtown to sites near its
4,500-employee North Avenue headquarters in the western sector of
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congestion has turned on the suburbs,'' said Gregg Logan, who
heads the Atlanta office of Robert Charles Lesser Co., a national
consulting firm. ``It is not surprising that companies are looking
back in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given Atlanta's inability to build highways in the suburbs,
BellSouth seems to be betting that the situation is going to get
worse before it gets better,'' said Logan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's validation of the notion that development demand by
corporate users is gravitating intown,'' said Tom Watson, executive
vice president of Jamison Research Inc., a major provider of
information on commercial real estate here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a warning flag to the suburbs that it's time for smart
growth,'' Watson said. ``It is going to say a lot to north Fulton,
Cobb and Gwinnett that have been attracting these technology
companies. ``
</P>
<P>
   While Midtown development is more expensive than the suburbs,
BellSouth will be able to achieve costs comparable to those for
suburban office space in the Buckhead locations, Logan said.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth officials indicated the buildings will be functional
and not landmark towers.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its off-Peachtree location, Lenox Park is closer in
price to the suburbs, and at Lindbergh ``BellSouth will have
transportation and almost suburban land prices in an area that's
about to take off,'' Logan said.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Stevenson, Carter executive vice president of
development, said BellSouth's addition to the complex ``gives
instant credibility to the site.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth's plan, developed over the past 14 months, ``is
cheaper and gives more flexibility'' than the company's current
leases, expected renewal costs and growth projected for five to
seven years, according to Inge Waddle, vice president of property
at BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still exploring the financial alternatives,'' Waddle
said, and the company has not determined if it will own the
facilities or lease them, perhaps in a sale-leaseback transaction.
Construction is expected to be started later this year and
buildings will be completed between 2001 and 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The suburban space to be vacated is in 75 locations. The larger
locations are at Century Center in DeKalb County, Perimeter Center
in Sandy Springs and Executive Park in northeast Atlanta. All of
the large spaces are leased by BellSouth, with the exception of one
building at Perimeter Center and another at Executive Park. Both of
those will be placed up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Neither BellSouth Center nor the 600,000 square feet of space
the company occupies in the Campanile building and the 1100
Peachtree Building will be affected.

STUDY EQUATES BENEFITS OF LIFESTYLE, GYM EXERCISE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Science has come to the rescue of all who can't imagine
themselves wearing Spandex and sweating in a gym. Two studies
published Wednesday show that no-sweat, no-equipment activities
squeezed into busy everyday lives produce equal health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Improvements in fitness, blood pressure, cholesterol, weight
loss, amount of body fat, and mood were no greater among
individuals randomly assigned to vigorous aerobic programs than
among comparable people who engaged in dribs and drabs of
moderate-intensity ``lifestyle'' exercise such as brisk walking,
taking the stairs instead of elevators, and doing household chores.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is good news for people who don't enjoy traditional
exercise programs or are not able to do it,'' said Ross E.
Anderson, a Johns Hopkins University researcher who led a study
comparing the two exercise approaches among 40 obese women.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to go to the gym unless you want to,'' added
Andrea L. Dunn of the Cooper Institute for Aerobic Research in
Dallas, an author of a second study comparing the two strategies
among 235 previously sedentary men and women.
</P>
<P>
   Exercise experts said the new studies, published in this week's
Journal of the American Medical Association, provide some of the
strongest evidence so far on the health benefits of moderate
activities that can be worked into daily life.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence ``substantially bolsters the case for lifestyle
physical activity and has important public health implications,''
said Dr. Michael Pratt of the US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta. ``Modest amounts of physical activity,
within the reach of most people, will improve health.''
</P>
<P>
   Research over the past five years has pointed in this direction,
but until now the evidence has been largely epidemiological _ based
on statistical associations in large populations. The Dallas and
Baltimore groups documented the effects on individuals randomly
assigned to one or the other type of exercise program.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt said the studies were ``noteworthy'' because they
monitored the exercise effects for two years, in the case of the
Dallas study, and 68 weeks, in the Baltimore project. ``Long-term
health benefits require long-term behavioral changes,'' Pratt noted
in a journal editorial accompanying the studies.
</P>
<P>
   The results may surprise many Americans who remember the
oft-repeated maxim that it takes at least 20 minutes of daily
vigorous exercise three times a week _ running, swimming, cycling
and the like _ to achieve meaningful health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The great majority of Americans have found that prescription
beyond their reach. Only about one-fifth of the population is
active enough to derive health benefits from exercise of any kind,
according to a 1996 report of the US Surgeon General.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gym-based programs probably help about 12 to 20 percent of
people,'' Dunn said, ``and that hasn't changed since the mid-1980s,
when the fitness boom occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   Even for those motivated to hit the gym, the conventional
exercise wisdom has actually worked against long-term adherence
because many people think it's no use if they can't keep up the
thrice-weekly routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people think `Oh, I've missed a week of exercise, I might
as well give up,' '' Dunn said. ``What these studies say is that
even these moderate activities can help maintain fitness during
those times, such as business trips, when they can't get to the
gym.''
</P>
<P>
   The new results do not imply that more intensive exercise
doesn't provide additional benefits, but both sets of researchers
agreed that the major gain comes from moving from being sedentary
to moderately active.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most encouraging results come from the study of
obese women, a collaboration of researchers at Johns Hopkins, the
University of Pennsylvania, and Cabrini College in Radnor, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers assigned 40 middle-aged women, obese since
adolescence and weighing an average of 192 pounds, to a vigorous,
16-week aerobics program or a four-month series of classes to teach
them how to be more active in their daily lives. All were asked to
stick to a 1,200-calorie daily diet _ a the American Heart
Association's standard weight-loss regimen.
</P>
<P>
   The aerobics program used stepping platforms and low-impact
movements choreographed especially for obese women; each 45-minute
session was designed to expend 450 to 500 calories _ a considerable
workout.
</P>
<P>
   The ``lifestyle'' group was quizzed regularly about how often
and how far they walked briskly, how often they climbed stairs, and
other activities. But researchers checked their answers against a
wearable computerized device to record their movements.
</P>
<P>
   Women in the lifestyle group increased their total activity
level by 28 percent, according to the devices. They lost the same
amount of weight as the aerobics group (about 17 pounds), but the
``lifestyle'' group actually did better in keeping weight off in
the year after the formal instruction ended.
</P>
<P>
   Other improvements, such as reduced body fat, lower blood
pressure, and better cholesterol and blood fat readings, were
comparable between the two groups. Both had substantial
improvements in mood too.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas study had a similar design, with 235 men and women
randomly assigned either to six months of intensive instruction in
gym workouts on their choice of treadmills, bicycles,
stairclimbers, and other equipment; or to classes that helped them
work out ways to accumulate at least 30 minutes of brisk walking
and other moderate exercise each day.
</P>
<P>
   The ``novel finding,'' the Texas researchers said, is that the
``lifestyle'' approach ``is as effective in producing beneficial
changes in physical activity, cardio-respiratory fitness, blood
pressure, and body composition as the traditional structured
approach.''

SENATORS ADAPT TO CLOSED SESSIONS

(bl) 
 By FRANK BRUNI and KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When their gazes drifted upward, toward a
four-sided gallery recently packed with reporters, foreign tourists
and even the stray Hollywood celebrity or two, senators saw only
empty seats and, behind those vacant rows, something that had been
invisible to them for the last few hectic weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You sat there looking up at the busts of the vice
presidents,'' said Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., referring to the
marble statues lining the outer, upper rim of the Senate chamber.
``Usually, they are camouflaged with thousands of people teeming
around.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the impeachment trial of President
Clinton began, Frist and other senators noted, there was relative
stillness: no revolving groups of spectators streaming in and out,
no aides scurrying to and fro.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a greater hush, especially Monday night, when
senators addressed one another without benefit of microphones. If
the colleague speaking was disinclined to shout, other senators
sometimes left their seats, strayed informally toward the well of
the chamber and leaned in close to listen.
</P>
<P>
   It was ``more intimate, more personal,'' Sen. John Kerry,
D-Mass., said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., agreed. ``We stripped away the
theater,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual closed-door debates that the Senate held Monday
night and again Tuesday afternoon and evening did not yield
agreement among senators on a number of points, including whether
they were proper and whether they were helpful.
</P>
<P>
   But there was almost unanimous consensus, in interviews with
more than a dozen senators Tuesday, that the atmosphere of these
sessions was rare and extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, this is a new process for almost everyone in the
Senate,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, saying that the only other
closed sessions he and many other senators had ever participated in
were national security briefings from outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very specific, and very limited in time,'' Gramm
said. ``Nothing like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday evening, the doors to the chamber closed for more than
four hours for a debate on a Democratic motion to dismiss the
charges against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday afternoon, the doors closed again for a debate on a
Republican motion to depose three witnesses. Suddenly, the hundreds
of spectators were asked to leave, and for several
movement-crippling minutes, they packed the third-floor hallways
outside the chamber, a startling reminder of the abrupt transition
inside from public proceeding to private conference.
</P>
<P>
   On both days, the television cameras in the chamber were turned
off, the reporters sent away. Senators could not summon aides to
their sides and, on Monday, could not use microphones.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, although the main audio system was again shut off and
senators could not use the microphones at their desks, a portable
microphone attached to two loudspeakers was made available to them.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, the senators were bound to a code of secrecy
about the content of their discussions. Any violation could, under
Rule 29 of the Standing Rules of the Senate, lead to ``expulsion
from the body.''
</P>
<P>
   Several senators, seemingly relishing this aura of mystery,
joked that the penalty could be even worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I tell you anything,'' Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, said
late Monday, ``they'll hang me by my thumbs.''
</P>
<P>
   A majority of Democrats had voted not to close these debates,
while a majority of Republicans wanted them held in secrecy, so
assessments of how useful the sessions were often split along party
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Most Republicans said the sessions promoted candor and comfort.
``If the public could see it, they would demand that we do it more,
not less,'' said Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would see people talking to each other instead of at each
other,'' Smith said. ``It's really remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Without television cameras, Smith added, ``people assume a
different posture.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., had apparently observed an
entirely different proceeding Monday night, after which he said he
concluded that ``senators are theatrical even in the privacy of
their home showers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't detect any noticeable change in demeanor,''
Torricelli said Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., said many senators seemed confused by
the sudden isolation. Imitating them in a mocking fashion, he said:
``Where do I look? Who do I talk to? What about these cards I want
to use? Where is my staff to tell me what to say?''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., one of the few Democrats who
voted to shut the chamber's doors, said that the measure was indeed
proving helpful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you about a closed debate,'' Byrd said Tuesday
morning. ``If the Constitutional Convention of 1787 had not closed
its doors, we would not have the Constitution we have today.''
</P>
<P>
   He explained that the Constitution's framers could speak bluntly
and fearlessly, and he said that that held true when the Senate's
doors closed this time.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., had voted to keep the
debate open, he said during a break in this evening's session that
closing it did have some positive effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Members are talking to one another,'' Schumer said, ``instead
of the rest of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Senators said that the tone of discussion on both nights
remained civil. One senator, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said that Tuesday evening's discussion was much more
intense and animated than Monday's, because the upcoming vote on
witnesses would be closer than the one on dismissing the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Another person who was in the chamber Tuesday night and who also
spoke on the condition of anonymity said that there were private
negotiations going on constantly in the back of the room. Up front,
this observer said, most senators spoke for five minutes each, with
Democrats and Republicans taking alternate turns speaking.
</P>
<P>
   Senators moved around more freely, sometimes drifting into small
clutches of private conversation, sometimes stretching their legs
or backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a remarkable thing,'' said Smith or Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Or, in the words of Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, ``very strange.''

   TELAGAKODOK, Indonesia _ The hands on the broken white plastic
wall clock show 10 minutes past 11, almost the exact time that an
enraged Muslim mob entered this village Wednesday and began killing
Christian residents, sending the entire population fleeing for
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The clock lies outside the ruins of a house, one of more than 40
set afire in this once bustling hillside village 20 miles northeast
of the town of Ambon, in the Spice Islands or Moluccas. Local
officials had originally reported that the attacks were on
Thursday. But they have concluded that the attacks were on
Wednesday, after clashes that began Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of life are few. A lone dog guarding the burned ruins of
his house barked at a stranger. On a neatly tended hedge
uncollected clothes had been set out to dry. A few goats, some
ducks and chickens foraged among the ruins, the only other signs of
life.
</P>
<P>
   Under police escort, a reporter visited the site, but the
officers were not eager to linger. They said many of the attackers
were from a Muslim community 300 yards down the road.
</P>
<P>
   The situation remains tense.
</P>
<P>
   A parish priest from a nearby village supervised the burial of
12 victims of the attack. But with many villagers unaccounted for,
several senior government and church officials said they believed
that the final death toll would be at least 40.
</P>
<P>
   The killings followed five days of rioting, looting and arson
that destroyed Muslim and Christian villages in the region and much
of the waterfront commercial district of Ambon.

 &HT;    Regulators hope for settlement on gas prices
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ State regulators hope the settlement of Atlanta Gas
Light Co.'s rate debacle will now clear the way for Georgia's
natural gas deregulation to proceed with promised savings for
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The Public Service Commission voted 4-0 Tuesday to accept a
settlement worked out between the utility and commission staff. The
pact should go a long way toward ending customer confusion over
AGL's bills.
</P>
<P>
   The utility agreed to refund $14.5 million in the form of checks
and bill credits to its customers, with most of the relief going to
those hurt the most by December's rate shock. Refunds for those
custromers will vary, but average about $23.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, AGL abandoned its controversial new rate structure
that resulted in many consumers' getting socked with hefty bills
when they used little or no gas in December because of built-in
charges for interstate pipeline capacity.
</P>
<P>
   The utility will return to a system that bases all gas charges
on the amount of gas actually consumed by a home or business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customers have spoken loud and clear,'' said Paula Rosput,
president and chief operating officer of AGL, referring to the the
outcry.
</P>
<P>
   The flap over AGL's rates, a controversy unprecedented in the
utility's 143-year-old history, was anticipated by few in the
utility industry. But it's been credited by many observers as being
a critical factor in a larger-than-anticipated migration of AGL
customers to marketers that began selling gas in the state Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   At last count, 284,000 of AGL's 1.5 million customers -- or 19
percent -- had switched to marketers, a much higher rate than in
other deregulation programs around the country at this stage in the
process. Once 33 percent have switched, the rest will be assigned
at random to marketers, and AGL will exit the gas sales business.
</P>
<P>
   PSC Chairman Stan Wise said he doubted that bringing AGL's
prices into line would stem the migration to marketers. ``The
momentum is there,'' he said. ``Over time and once market forces
are in control, prices will come down. ''
</P>
<P>
   The general sentiment at Tuesday's PSC meeting was, as state
utility counsel Jim Hurt put it, the settlement is not perfect.
``But we think it's in the best interest of everyone to move on,''
Hurt said.
</P>
<P>
   PSC member Robert Durden called the controversy a ``horrendous
experience'' that he blamed on AGL's ``failure to communicate'' and
hoped would not happen again.
</P>
<P>
   A sour note was sounded by Lynn R. Westergaard, president of
Resource Service Mininistries, an Atlanta activist group that is
active in PSC proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a mean-spirited and evil way, AGL has taken money from the
ratepaying public that borders on extortion, if not out-and-out
stealing,'' Westergaard said in a letter to the commission.
``Refunds should be made on a formula that matches
dollar-for-dollar for each household from whom money was
overcollected.''
</P>
<P>
   AGL said its new rate for gas usage that will show up in
February bills is 40 cents per therm, based on normal weather. Last
February, before deregulation, AGL's rate was 37 cents though the
utility undercharged consumers by $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   The new rate, however, is subject to change due to the weather.
Mark D. Caudill, vice president/rates and regulatory affairs at AGL
Resources Inc., parent of Atlanta Gas Light, said if weather is 50
percent warmer than usual, the rate could go as high as 52 cents
per therm. If it's 50 percent colder than usual, the AGL rate could
go as low as 35 cents per therm, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But at least, consumers will be able to figure out their bill
based on how many therms they use in a given billing period, AGL
officials said, instead of trying to figure out hoplessly
complicated pipeline capacity charges.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, customers will only be charged based on what they
use. ``If they use zero gas, they won't see gas charges on their
bill as in the last few months,'' said Terri Reichert, AGL's rates
manager.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of January rates offered by marketers found that gas
charges ranged from 37 cents per therm to 47 cents per therm, in
addition to fixed monthly delivery charges not affected by the
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Some marketers offer to lock in rates for up to three years,
others change rates monthly.
</P>
<P>
   Several marketing executives said the settlement would not cause
them to lower their rates to be more competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we're below AGL, we'll be fine,'' said Warren
Darby, senior vice president of South Carolina-based SCANA Energy,
which is believed to have a leading share of customners who have
switched to marketers. SCANA's current rate is 37 cents per therm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our pricing is not going to be affected,'' said A. Clifton
Payne, vice president for marketing at Georgia Natural Gas
Services, AGL's marketing affiliate.

AGAIN, CLINTON CREATES HIS OWN POLITICAL AURA 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also POPE-U.S., POPE-EXORCISM, POPE-JEWS) 
(lb) 
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ With Pope John Paul II at his side, Bill Clinton
declared Tuesday that the United States was striving to be ``an
example of justice and civic virtues'' _ as he once again adroitly
harnessed the presidency to save his situation.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, Clinton took President Nelson Mandela's hand to help
him down from a podium, and on Tuesday, again playing the admiring
protege, he did the same with the pope; but while he may have been
offering his support each time, Clinton clearly got at least as
good as he gave.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Washington, the House prosecutors were declaiming about
witnesses to the crimes of perjury and obstruction of justice that
they say Clinton committed in covering up his affair with Monica
Lewinsky. But as the president demonstrated again Tuesday, his most
potent cover-up is the political one he has conducted, all year, in
plain sight.
</P>
<P>
   By never mentioning Ms. Lewinsky or the trial while performing
the duties of his office and commanding its majesty, Clinton
essentially creates his own political atmosphere; through the
press, he pulls the country in.
</P>
<P>
   The thousands of Roman Catholics gathered in a shadowy, stuffy
airplane terminal here warmly greeted Clinton. They may not have
been applauding the Southern Baptist who has confessed his
infidelity to the world, but they most certainly applauded the
president of the United States, repeatedly punctuating his words of
welcome, on behalf of the country. There were no cries of ``God
bless you!'' as there were for the pope, but there were no cries of
protest, either.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told the pope, ``You have never let those of us who
enjoy the blessings of prosperity, freedom and peace forget our
responsibilities.'' He said the pope would see ``an America working
harder to be what you have asked us to be: an example of justice
and civic virtues, freedom fulfilled and goodness at home and
abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee
who is the lead prosecutor in the president's impeachment trial,
and David Schippers, the committee's chief counsel, are both papal
knights, an honor granted to several hundred Roman Catholics who
promote the church's interests. Hyde and Schippers were in
Washington working to remove Clinton from office as the pope
clasped the president's hands in both of his and smiled up at him
on the podium.
</P>
<P>
   The pope brought no hint of the storm in Washington to Clinton's
self-created political atmosphere. He thanked Clinton for his
courtesy, and did not say a word about Ms. Lewinsky. The pope stuck
with policy, the arena the president prefers, making his profound
policy differences with Clinton clear by declaring that the United
States must outlaw abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only a higher moral vision can motivate the choice for life,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who did not publicly address the issue Tuesday,
supports abortion rights, saying abortion should be ``safe, legal
and rare.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, his aides say over and over, is just doing the job that
he loves the way that he loves to do it. And that is true. It is a
classic bit of Clinton luck, however, that the job is now, as the
trial is under way, supplying him with extraordinary opportunities
to switch subjects.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago he delivered his State of the Union address, resting
his arms on the lectern and leaning toward his hostile audience in
a folksy, friendly, initiative-packed appeal that shot right over
their heads. On Tuesday he descended the stairs of Air Force One
holding the hand of his wife, Hillary, before sharing the world's
spotlight with the pope. And on Monday, Clinton will unveil his
budget _ part intricate policy statement, part political broadside,
and a certain attention-getter.
</P>
<P>
   A less skilled politician or policy-maker, or perhaps a more
easily abashed man, could not pull it off. But Clinton makes it
look easy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In December, Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the House majority whip,
said, ``I'm suggesting that the president of the United States
cannot be believed, and I think it's reflected in his foreign
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in anchoring Clinton's defense to the Senate, former
Sen. Dale Bumpers of Arkansas countered with a list of foreign
leaders _ from Mandela to President Carlos Menem of Argentina to
King Hussein of Jordan _ who have praised Clinton's leadership in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   But the president seems to make the debate over his credibility
irrelevant by ignoring it and simply showing up for his job. On
Tuesday he met with the pope for about 20 minutes and covered a
broad range of subjects, from Iraq to Cuba to Mexico. The pope
urged the United States to remain engaged in the world, and Clinton
asked him to repeat that message to the American people. Mrs.
Clinton had a meeting with 15 cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton landed in the blue-and-white presidential 747, he
left it to his aides to handle the matters in Washington. In a
trailer by the runway, Joe Lockhart, his press secretary,
criticized the House prosecutors as ``falling back on their old
habit of playing politics.''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Clinton gave no hint of concern. He was relaxed and
cheerful, even joking with the pope, whom he has met three times
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Church should buy the company producing the
film,'' he said, as photographers' shutters chattered madly, ``and
you could fund all the Catholic charities all over the world with
it. We could sell all the film the photographers use.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was any doubt that by virtue of his position, Clinton
occupied as lofty a plane as the pope on Tuesday _ or that the
pope, by virtue of being human, had some of the same needs as
Clinton _ it was erased by the sign marking a restroom near their
meeting room: ``President or Holy Father Only,'' it read.

COMMENTARY: THE CRYBABY PARTY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK RICH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was just a year ago that America's TV anchors dumped the pope
in Cuba for a rendezvous with Monica Lewinsky in Washington. Almost
all you need to know about what's happened since is that Bill
Clinton flew to St. Louis to bask in the sunny glow of the pope,
while his tormentors remained mired in D.C. with Monica.
</P>
<P>
   A cynic might say that the president was exploiting the papal
visit to burnish his image. But you could argue that the pope has
more to gain: in a year-end Gallup Poll Americans named the
president as ``most admired'' man, reducing the pontiff to a
distant runner-up. Where does that leave the high priests of
morality who are prosecuting Clinton for sleazy sex and lies?
They're not even in the game. In a Washington Post poll this week,
Larry Flynt earned a 40 percent approval rating _ which means the
publisher of Hustler has now pulled ahead not only of Kenneth Starr
but of the Republican Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even now Clinton's adversaries don't know what hit them.
They argue that Slick Willie, through some black arts of spin, has
stacked the deck. They cry that the polls are rigged. They will
soon, no doubt, return to vilifying the ``liberal media.'' But
while the right is fond of lecturing everyone else about
``individual responsibility,'' it takes no responsibility for its
own calamities, whether political (dumping all of Starr's
unexpurgated porn on the country) or moral (ceding the impeachment
high ground to Trent Lott and Bob Barr, who not only appeared
before a racist organization but lied about it). The Republicans'
woes are everyone else's fault. Newt Gingrich may be gone, but now
more than ever the GOP is the party of crybabies.
</P>
<P>
   In their who-blew-impeachment debate, the Clinton adversaries
are even turning on each other rather than accept any culpability
for their ill fortunes. The hard right bashes GOP conservatives,
and House managers like Barr trash their Senate colleagues for
short attention spans and failings of principle. But the greatest
anger _ and blame _ is directed at the idiotic, craven, morally
bankrupt American people. William Bennett's yearlong lament over
the death of public outrage is rapidly becoming his party's
post-impeachment platform.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend Henry Hyde called for an ``abnormal
psychologist'' to do ``a dissertation'' on our ethical failings.
Andrea Sheldon, whose Traditional Values Coalition cheerleads
Republican gay-bashing, declared last week that ``the American
people are really messed up.'' James Dobson, the party's most
influential religious-right power broker, has decreed that ``our
people no longer recognize the nature of evil.'' Somewhat more
elegantly, Bill Kristol has suggested that ``the Founders were
right to have a certain distrust of democracy.'' His contempt is
breezily fleshed out this week in the pages of his magazine, The
Weekly Standard, by the humorist P.J. O'Rourke, who describes ``the
American people'' as ``masses waddling into airports, business
offices and churches dressed in drooping sweats or fuchsia warm-up
suits or mainsail-sized Bermuda shorts, each with a mobile phone in
one ear and a Walkman in the other and sucking Diet Pepsi through a
straw.''
</P>
<P>
   The only Americans these American-loathers seem to like are
``the children.'' Ever since Hyde closed his trial summation with a
letter from 8-year-old William Summers of Chicago chastising the
president for lying, the mantra of the impeachment brigade has been
that the president must be punished to save America's youth, who
have been mortally poisoned by Clinton's sordid behavior. Perhaps
if some of these politicians actually had children at home _ or
spent any time with them _ they'd learn that kids do not look to
Washington, whether the White House or Congress, for spiritual role
models. If they did, how do we account for the fact that teen-age
pregnancies, out-of-wedlock births, abortions and cocaine use, not
to mention crime, have all declined during the years our president
has been setting his appalling example?
</P>
<P>
   In their desperate search for a scapegoat for their woes, the
right may have to turn on children next _ starting with little
William Summers. The day after Hyde read the third grader's letter
in the Senate, the boy went on TV to say that he liked the
president and thought he was ``doing a good job'' and should not be
impeached. The death of outrage, it would seem, must be nipped in
the crib.

BEADS GIVE WILLIAMS A HEADACHE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE _ To bead or not to bead?
</P>
<P>
   If that is the question for Venus Williams, the answer is that
the headstrong young lady is not amused by any suggestion that she
change her hairstyle. Even though, extraordinarily, it cost her a
critical game and, admittedly, her poise as she faded from
prominent view at the Australian Open. She will continue with the
baubles and beads, but she may have to tighten up the act.
</P>
<P>
   Hoist by her own beads _ and the petard-like explosive strokes
of Lindsay Davenport _ Williams was victimized by perhaps the most
curious penalty point ruling in the game's annals. Surely a
coiffure had never caused its owner to be officially disciplined,
and trimmed of a point, but she head-bumped into the so-called
``hindrance rule.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as Williams has often said, ``I'm new and different.''
</P>
<P>
   Beads flew like birds from her renowned braids in the second set
of the long-awaited all-American quarterfinal clash Tuesday with
the game's newly anointed No. 1, Davenport, and an audience of
15,000 were themselves amused. At first.
</P>
<P>
   Clicking and spilling across the green asphalt floor as Williams
launched a serve, they were a rolling rainbow of pink, blue, green,
yellow, but mostly white, interrupting the point. Bead eruption
summoned laughs from witnesses as umpire Denis Overberg called,
``Let!'' The point would be replayed.
</P>
<P>
   At that juncture of Davenport's 6-4, 6-0, victory _ which
elevated her to the semis against Amelie Mauresmo, a startling
unseeded French teen-ager _ Williams was struggling. Down, 0-2,
30-all, she needed a break, not a bead breakup.
</P>
<P>
   The replayed point went to Davenport's fiery forehand passer
along the line, and Williams faced a breaker at 30-40.
</P>
<P>
   There was a gasp from the customers as Williams uncoiled into
another serve _ hers is the speediest in the female precinct,
clocked as high as 127 m.p.h. _ because accompanying a yellow ball
were more beads. The splatter was accompanied by Overberg's voice:
``Point. Game, Davenport. She leads, three games to love.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams was furious. She stormed at the man in his highchair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said a lot of things to him,'' she recalled with a smile,
``but I can't remember what.''
</P>
<P>
   She demanded that the case go to the supreme court, in this
jurisdiction the tournament referee. Referee Peter Bellenger
appeared on court to hear her arguments, nodded politely, but
confirmed the umpire's verdict. ``It's the rule, no question, even
if it's not always enforced,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though played out to a closing bagel, the match was as good as
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost my focus, my composure,'' Williams said. ``It wasn't
fair. I'm not notorious for losing my beads. It's happened before,
and I wasn't penalized.''
</P>
<P>
   But she also conceded that Overberg had issued a ``warning'' at
the first jewelry overflow, saying, ``If this happens again you
lose a point.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately it was a break point, and the beads seemed pennies
from heaven for Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   ``That rule wasn't made for beads,'' pleaded Williams. ``This
was an isolated incident. But I learned a lesson, and there's no
need to be emotional about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The rule reads: ``If a player hinders an opponent it can be
ruled involuntary or deliberate. The first time (ball falling out
of pocket, hat falling off etc.), a let should be called and player
told that any such hindrance thereafter will be ruled deliberate,
and result in loss of a point.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently those naughty beads fall (or fell) under the ``etc.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport sympathized to the extent that, ``It's happened to me
when my cap fell off a couple of times. But the beads are a little
annoying _ and I'd think dangerous to her if she stepped on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport, nearly beaten by Williams in the quarters a year ago
(1-6, 7-5, 6-3), said, ``She didn't have a Plan B to fall back on
when I got out of the first set.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport slipped four break points to seize that five-deuce
battle to 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   The breathtaking, rocketing baseline duels of the two most
imposing adversaries to grace a major championship (Davenport an
inch taller, 6-3, four years older, 22) usually went to Davenport.
Williams, five lengths behind at No. 6, couldn't come up with
anything to swerve Davenport from her self-assured broadsides.
</P>
<P>
   She needs to work on volleying and beads. Would a super
hairspray prevent beadspray? Not my department, but we've all had
bad hair days, haven't we?

SEC OFFICIAL JOINS BEAR STEARNS UNIT UNDER INVESTIGATION 
</HEADLINE>

 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Richard R. Lindsey, director of market regulation for
the Securities and Exchange Commission, is stepping down to join a
unit of Bear Stearns Co. that is being investigated by the
Manhattan District Attorney's office and federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey, 44, will become a senior managing director at the
company and the No. 2 at Bear Stearns Clearing Corp., which
processes and guarantees the trades of small firms, maintains their
customers' accounts and lends them money. He is expected to begin
work in March.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey's move to a company that is under scrutiny by regulators
and the authorities is sure to raise eyebrows. At issue in the
investigations is Bear Stearns' role in the demise of A.R. Baron &AMP;
Co., a small brokerage firm in New York City that failed in 1996.
Bear Stearns was Baron's clearing firm. Customers of A.R. Baron
lost $75 million in what Manhattan District Attorney Robert
Morgenthau called a criminal enterprise. Morgenthau's office won
convictions against 14 Baron employees in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an intriguing move by Bear Stearns,'' said Lewis D.
Lowenfels, a securities lawyer in New York who represents a firm
that lost money with A.R. Baron. ``The larger question is what
effect this will have on their pending investigations and
litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   As is its custom, the SEC would neither confirm nor deny that it
is investigating Bear Stearns' role in the failure. Morgenthau had
no comment on what effect Lindsey's hiring might have on his
office's continuing investigation.
</P>
<P>
   James E. Cayne, president and chief executive of Bear Stearns,
said that Lindsey's hiring was not an effort to shore up the
brokerage firm's reputation or credibility. ``His basic function is
to come into the correspondent clearing company at Bear Stearns,''
Cayne said. ``It is a very big part of our business. He is a
visionary; he's got a terrific reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Cayne, Richard Harriton, head of Bear Stearns
clearing unit, will remain in the top job. There is currently no
second in command.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he was the commission's chief market regulator,
people close to Lindsey said he has not been involved in the Bear
Stearns matter. As a Bear Stearns employee, he must follow strict
government guidelines in dealing with his former colleagues at the
commission. He cannot appear before the commission, for example, or
telephone or write to former colleagues there for one year after he
leaves. And Lindsey cannot ever lobby the SEC on any matter that he
may have worked on while he was a regulator.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey said his decision to join Bear Stearns crystalized in
the last two weeks. He declined to comment on what his pay at the
firm would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that I have a lot of things to contribute,'' Lindsey
said. ``I've had a long management history working in a lot of
different types of organizations. That usually brings something to
the table to see where you need to take things.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As the chief regulator of the securities markets, Lindsey has
been responsible for a number of SEC initiatives, including
regulations developed late last year that allow for the creation of
new stock exchanges through alternative trading systems. He was the
first director of market regulation who was not a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   But Lindsey's biggest accomplishment was carrying out the SEC's
order-handling rules in 1997, which required that customers who
wanted to buy or sell Nasdaq stocks at prices in between the
current bid and asked prices could have their orders displayed on
the national quotation system. This rule change, which came out of
the enforcement action brought in 1996 by the SEC against Nasdaq
for unfair trading practices, has made it easier for individual
investors to meet on Nasdaq rather than having to place trades
through an intermediary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard Lindsey was the catalyst for dramatic changes in the
way our markets operate, saving investors billions of dollars a
year,'' said SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt. ``He really was the
architect of the order-handling rules, and he went around to firms
and he sold it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey became director of market regulation at the SEC in
November 1995 after having served as the commission's chief
economist. He came to the SEC from Yale University, where he was a
professor of finance.
</P>
<P>
   Before teaching, Lindsey was a research engineer for Owens
Corning Fiberglas and later worked for the CertainTeed Corp., a
privately held maker of fiberglass, first as manager of process
engineering and then as plant manager for the company's
manufacturing plant in Dallas. Lindsey has a bachelor's degree in
chemical engineering from the Illinois Institute of Technology, an
MBA from the University of Dallas and a doctorate in finance from
the University of California at Berkeley.

 &HT;    Partisan voting expected in impeachment trial
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After three-weeks of largely bipartisan harmony,
Senate leaders predict mostly party-line votes today in the first
of two crucial test votes on the impeachment evidence against
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Key Republicans said they had the numbers to defeat a Democratic
motion to dismiss the two charges against Clinton and enough votes
to depose three witnesses requested by House prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to end the trial with some bipartisan agreement to vote
directly on the articles of impeachment evaporated Tuesday after
Senate Republicans appeared to embrace a call by House prosecutors
to depose only three witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``My instincts say that would pass,'' said Sen. Paul Coverdell
(R-Ga.), a Senate GOP leader.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the prosecutors pleaded with the Senate to subpoena
and depose Monica Lewinsky, the central player in the impeachment
drama; presidential confidant Vernon Jordan and White House aide
Sidney Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors also asked for the opportunity to question
Clinton himself, a proposal quickly dismissed by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders insisted that the three witnesses could be deposed
in fewer than five days, keeping the impeachment trial contained to
a short but undefined duration.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's lawyers and several Senate Democrats warned that
any vote to depose witnesses, no matter how few, would lead to a
prolonged trial that most Americans do not want.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are spinning this notion somehow that this can be done in
a few days,'' said Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.). ``That's nonsense.
This will take weeks, if not months.''
</P>
<P>
   Senators deliberated the motion for witnesses late into the
evening Tuesday after rejecting a second bid by Sen. Tom Harkin
(D-Iowa) to open up the deliberations to the public. The 41-58 vote
was mostly along party lines, with three Republicans joining
Democrats in voting ``yes'' and six Democrats joining Republicans
in opposition. Sen. Max Cleland (D-Ga.) voted for it and Coverdell
voted against, Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.) missed the vote after
checking into a Baltimore hospital to undergo observation for flu
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   At some points during the day, the confluence of events bordered
on the absurd. While White House lawyers were making the case that
no witnesses should be called, Clinton himself was in St. Louis
welcoming Pope John Paul II. CNN telecast a split screen showing
David Kendall, Clinton's personal lawyer, standing in the well of
the Senate while Clinton embraced the Pope a 1,000 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time Rep. Bill McCollum (R-Fla.) was making
the case to depose Lewinsky, Lewinsky herself decamped from the
Mayflower Hotel, where she has been holed up since Saturday, and
left for an undisclosed location.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement worked out three weeks ago, the Senate will
reconvene at 1 p.m. today and vote first on a motion to dismiss the
charges that Clinton perjured himself and obstructed justice. If
that motion fails, as most predict it will, senators will
immediately vote on the motion to depose the three witnesses
requested by House prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   If that motion succeeds, Republicans plan to offer a motion that
would put the depositions on a speedy track. Sen. John Chafee
(R-R.I.), a key GOP moderate, circulated language that would limit
the depositions to a maximum of four hours, with prosecutors and
White House lawyers allowed two hours each to ask questions.
</P>
<P>
   The depositions would be videotaped and the questions to the
witnesses could relate only to the official record _ not subjects
that haven't previously been covered. Under Chafee's timetable, the
depositions could be completed by Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans suggested that the videotaping could be a way for
the Senate to avoid actually having to call witnesses to testify in
person, which will require a separate vote.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats offered no official response to Chafee's proposal, but
they signaled that they will reject any witness procedure that they
believe limits Clinton's opportunity to gather evidence and call
witnesses himself.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the Republican timetable for witnesses ``unrealistic,''
Sen. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), the Democratic minority leader, said
there were 54,000 pages of evidence that White House lawyers have
not yet reviewed. Daschle's chief lawyer estimated such a review
could take ``weeks,'' not including additional time to prepare
their own witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of that must be made available in order for us to be fair
as we begin to consider contributions made by witnesses,'' Daschle
said. ``Our colleagues need to clearly understand that if it's a
choice between expeditious and fair, Democrats are going to fall on
the side of fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House echoed the theme both on and off the Senate
floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you have one witness or 15 witnesses, there will still
be a need for extended discovery,'' said White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart, traveling with the president in St. Louis. White House
lawyers do not plan to make their own witness list public until
after the Senate vote.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas) accused Democrats of posturing simply
to maintain the pressure on Republican moderates, who are leery of
dragging out the trial by deposing witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think their threats are meaningless,'' Gramm said.
</P>
<P>
   The hardening positions on the part of both Republicans and
Democrats on the issue of witnesses was the latest signal Tuesday
that the impeachment trial is entering a new phase.
</P>
<P>
   Senators from both parties have congratulated each other on the
relative calm and cooperation that has characterized the trial so
far, but now some are beginning gird themselves for a period of
heightened partisan confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said he feared that partisanship would
escalate like a nuclear arms race, spiralling ``up and up.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Kerry said he thought that Republicans had seized on
their first exit plan by promoting only three witnesses who would
be deposed quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to finish it on their terms,'' Kerry said. ``But it
may not be on their terms....They cannot dictate the president's
strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there appeared to be no love lost between the House
prosecutors and Senate Republicans, who repeatedly told them in no
uncertain terms that any more than three witnesses would not be
supported in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had to narrow our requests down at the urgent request of
well-meaning senators who really don't want any witnesses at all,''
said Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) with more than a trace
of sarcasm.

TRIAL WATCHERS WONDER: WHY BLUMENTHAL? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the end, Betty Currie got dumped for Sidney
Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   Republican prosecutors Tuesday said they want to call
Blumenthal, assistant to President Clinton, as one of three
witnesses on their truncated wish-list in the Senate impeachment
trial. The move surprised many legal scholars who viewed Currie,
Clinton's personal secretary, as a much more important witness.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal, a journalist turned presidential adviser, was one of
the aides to whom Clinton first denied having a sexual relationship
with Monica S. Lewinsky after the scandal became public last Jan.
21.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say his testimony would help shed light on Clinton's
efforts to obstruct justice by proving the president lied to his
aides knowing that they might be called to testify before the grand
jury and showing that the president, by depicting her to Blumenthal
as a ``stalker,'' may have been trying to conceal the true nature
of the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   David Kendall, Clinton's personal attorney, said there was no
reason to call Blumenthal ``except to try to embarass the president
by the presentation of testimony from a member of his senior
staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal's attorney, William A. McDaniel, said in an interview
that ``Sidney has no objections under the proper circumstances to
testify. He would be glad to.''
</P>
<P>
   McDaniel added: ``I know what he's testified to and so does
everybody else, and I don't know why they want to get at it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   The other two witnesses prosecutors want to call, should the
Senate allow it, are Lewinsky and Washington power broker Vernon E.
Jordan Jr., Clinton's confidant and golfing buddy. These two
witnesses have been widely expected to be summoned to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Peter J. Wallison, a White House counsel to President Reagan
during the Iran-Contra affair, said the decision to call Blumenthal
was ``puzzling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I could understand bringing him in if Currie was invited,'' he
said. ``I can't understand inviting him without Currie, because I
think she is more important, at least as I understand the case,
more important than he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen A. Saltzburg, a law professor at George Washington
University, also questioned the wisdom of the House prosecutors
wanting to depose Blumenthal and call him as witness, noting that
Blumenthal is one of the most impassioned defenders of the
president and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton as can be found at
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Brandeis University, Blumenthal joined the White
House staff in the summer of 1997, after a journalism career that
began in Boston and included work as a writer for the New Yorker,
the New Republic and the Washington Post. He is considered
especially close to the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Saltzburg suggested Blumenthal was called because Republican
prosecutors ``don't have anywhere else to go,'' and Currie's
``memory got worse and worse every time she appeared before the
grand jury'' investigating whether Clinton covered up his
relationship with the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Rose O'Sullivan, a criminal law professor at Georgetown
University Law Center, said of Blumenthal: ``If that's one of their
top three, then you have to wonder how strong there case is.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Currie would have been a more logical choice because
her testimony seemed to change over time, making it useful to call
her in, nail her down on her story and subject her to
cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps they don't like the idea of calling two
African-Americans'' said O'Sullivan, referring to Jordan and
Currie, both of whom are black.
</P>
<P>
   But Leonard Garment, who was a White House counsel to President
Nixon during Watergate, disagreed. ``It was smart of them to call
Blumenthal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Citing Clinton's reference to Lewinsky as a stalker in his
conversation with Blumenthal, Garment suggested that these
misleading buttressed the case for obstruction of justice. ``That
was really bad stuff, very different from anything that has been
said or suggested. It's clear cut.''
</P>
<P>
   In making the case to call Blumenthal, House prosecutor James E.
Rogan of California told senators that, ``The White House contends
before this body that the president did nothing to obstruct their
investigation. The evidence shows that he did.''
</P>
<P>
   According to House prosecutors, Clinton told Blumenthal the same
day news surfaced of his affair with Lewinsky that she came on to
him and made a sexual demand. Clinton stated that he rebuffed
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also told Blumenthal that Lewinsky had ``threatened''
him, saying she would tell people they had had an affair, and that
she was known as a ``stalker'' among White House aides.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan said Blumenthal's grand jury testimony came before Clinton
admitted the affair with Lewinsky. He said prosecutors also want to
know of a ``potential plan to destroy Monica Lewinsky if she ever
decided to cooperate with law enforcement authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   McDaniel, Blumenthal's attorney, said such allegations were
based on ``just speculation. They have no basis for it in fact.''

 &HT;    Sharpe tongue tireless
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The incident that informed Denver's Shannon Sharpe he
had an uncontrollable proclivity for, well, running his mouth,
occurred when he was in elementary school. He was around 7 or 8,
and no one was talking to him, but the urge came to interject, and
he did. He hasn't shut up since.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a speech class,'' Sharpe said Tuesday at the Super
Bowl's Media Day. ``This guy named Johnny was reading, and the
teacher said, 'No, student, don't you help him. Let me help him.'
She wanted him to sound the words out.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so, he got to a word he couldn't pronounce, and the
teacher said, 'OK, Johnny, it sounds like? Sounds like?' So I said,
'It sounds like Johnny can't read.' She said to me: 'Shannon
Sharpe, you get out of the class. Get out of class.'''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Broncos treated the barrage of media as if they were
in class. They had been through it before _ last year in San Diego
_ so it was more business as usual than an annoyance.
</P>
<P>
   For Sharpe, who grew up in the tiny town of Glenville, near
Savannah, business as usual means talking. And talking. And ...
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, he enjoys the give and take.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the best blocking tight end in the NFL because my back
(Terrell Davis) got 2,000 yards behind me,'' Sharpe said. ``No one
else got 2,000 yards, so that makes me the best tight end in the
game. People said, 'Shannon Sharpe is the best catching tight end
in the game.' But they say 'Brett Favre is the best quarterback.'
They don't say, 'Brett Favre is the best handoff quarterback.' So,
why label me?''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe could go on and on _ and did. But his teammates,
especially the offensive line, have chastised him for dishing out
nasty lyrics to defenders that do not line up against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it irritates you,'' offensive lineman Mark Schlereth
said. ``Shannon always wants to trash talk against a guy he's not
playing against. We tell him, 'Don't start a fire under my guy.'
He's been better about it (recently).''
</P>
<P>
   Considering his Sharpe tongue, it's a wonder it was the Falcons'
Ray Buchanan who issued the guarantee of victory, instead of the
rangy tight end. But Sharpe did say to the Dolphins during a
playoff game on Jan. 9: ``What's it feel like to have the Super
Bowl in your house and not be invited?''
</P>
<P>
   He said he omits mothers, girlfriends and wives from his trash
talking during games; everything else is fair game. ``If you have a
deformity, yes, I will talk about it,'' he said. ``Anything to get
into someone's head. So, I'll be talking Sunday. Bet on that.''

SHOCK TO REPLACE DUMMIES IN TV ADS ON SEAT BELTS
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Convinced that friendly persuasion has reached its
limit, the Transportation Department is switching to shock in its
effort to convince people to wear seat belts. The department's new
television advertisements drop the clownish crash-test dummies
Vince and Larry, which have been smashed in countless
advertisements, in favor of the everyday activities of live actors
who, in the last seconds of the advertisement, fall prey to
heart-stopping crashes.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements begin soft and friendly, like those for
long-distance telephone service, but end abruptly with a crash. In
one, a husband on a midnight run to buy the ice cream that his
pregnant wife craves is hit by an oncoming car when he backs out of
the driveway. Another features teen-age girls in a convertible and
two boys in a sedan, all giggling and pointing as they cruise down
a street, until the boys' sedan is struck by a speeding van.
</P>
<P>
   ``Didn't see that coming?'' says the caption. ``No one ever
does. Buckle up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Advertising Council plans to produce a series of such spots
after deciding, along with the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, that Vince and Larry were not reaching the
one-third of the population _ mostly young males _ that still does
not wear seat belts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vince and Larry are dead,'' said Kenneth Ulmer, a spokesman
for the council. But they will continue to appear in time slots
when small children are likely to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ricardo Martinez, the administrator of the highway agency,
said studies show that many people do not wear seat belts because
``they believe they are in charge and nothing will happen to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get a bit of reality out there so people understand
they're not in charge and it can happen to anyone,'' added
Martinez, a former emergency room physician.
</P>
<P>
   Seat belt use has reached a plateau, at about 68 percent for
front-seat occupants. The federal government and private campaign
organizers have been influenced by Australian television
advertisements, truly gory by American standards, that officials
there say have helped cut accident rates among young drivers. Those
spots show dead bodies and a crash survivor struggling to learn how
to walk.
</P>
<P>
   The new American advertisements, which will appear in February,
tread a fine line. Emily Soell, a member of the committee of
outsiders that reviews Advertising Council public service
announcements, said they went through several editings. ``We had to
bring them to a point where it really was believable, and it wasn't
just so depressing that you would turn off and go into denial,''
said Ms. Soell, the chief creative officer of Draftworldwide, an
advertising agency in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The new advertisements face a challenging task, said Dr. Jay
Winsten, associate dean and director of the Center for Health
Communication at the Harvard School of Public Health. ``The
seat-belt issue is not really on people's radar screen right now,''
he said. ``The biggest challenge is to get it back on.''

 &HT;    Atwater bats down talk of his decline
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Even before he put pen to paper, Steve Atwater knew a
five-year contract was a stretch when he signed it in 1995. He was
29, played the game as violently as it can be played and understood
that retirement was perhaps only one collision away.
</P>
<P>
   And so that time had appeared to come in November. Atwater had
been slow to come around from offseason surgeries on both shoulders
_ making five total, plus two on his knees _ and the Broncos had
started benching their captain and seven-time Pro Bowl safety on
third down for second-year man George Coghill. A final year
remained on his contract at a non-guaranteed $2.6 million. But even
if it looked like the end of the road, Atwater wasn't going to give
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothered me somewhat,'' he said. ``George is a friend of
mine, and I was supporting him as much as I could. But that really
wasn't a motivation for me... I don't regret any of it. It was just
something I went through.''
</P>
<P>
   In short order, Coghill was back on the sideline, and Atwater
returned to a form that got him to the Pro Bowl for the eighth
time. He began to feel better. In the postseason, he has been
active, causing two fumbles in the AFC title game with the New York
Jets; the second came in a fourth-quarter collision with Alex Van
Dyke, and Bill Romanowski recovered to secure the victory.
</P>
<P>
   When the retirement questions come now, he smiles at them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've thought about it just a little bit,'' he said. ``My
body's feeling good. I don't feel like this will be my last year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every once in a while, you may look at a guy, and he may not
have had a great offseason program and he doesn't come in in great
shape,'' Broncos coach Mike Shanahan said. ``Or maybe he goes
through a preseason where he isn't as sharp as he was the year
before. And he's got to push it a little harder. Maybe he's a year
older and he's lost a step.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you can't do is lose that edge. Steve Atwater is a smart
safety. He understands the game. He's a worker, and he does
everything he can to prepare himself to play his best. And that's
why he's had an excellent year.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no denying Atwater has lost that step, but he and
Romanowski remain the top names on a defensive unit that has
allowed only 98 rushing yards in its past four games. Still a
ferocious hitter, he is a man the Falcons have to beat for a chance
to win on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just adds a dimension,'' linebacker John Mobley said.
``Steve's still one of the elite players in the league, one of the
classiest guys you ever would want to meet. He's meant a great deal
to all the younger players coming up. He's someone to look up to.''
</P>
<P>
   Still.

SPLIT VOTE UNCONSTITUTIONAL, SCHOLARS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Budgeted as Impeach-Collins)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It is a novel exit strategy for ending the Senate's
impeachment trial. It offers the opportunity for lawmakers to
harshly penalize President Clinton for his conduct _ something
members of both parties favor _ while bowing to the political
reality that there aren't enough votes to remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, legal scholars said Tuesday, is it's
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wrong, that's all there is to it,'' said Akhil Amar, a
Yale law professor and constitutional scholar.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, Republican Senators Orrin Hatch of Utah and Susan
Collins of Maine have raised the possibility of splitting the final
impeachment vote. The first would be on whether Clinton committed
perjury or obstruction of justice. If found guilty on either
charge, a separate ballot would be held on removing the president
from office.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would permit Republicans to end the trial saying they
had tried to impose as severe a penalty on the president as
possible given the political realities of 45 Democratic senators
and huge public support for Clinton. At the same time, they would
be bowing to those realities by leaving the popular Democratic
leader in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and many Democrats seem unlikely to support the
split-vote idea because it gives the GOP majority too much of what
it wants. But whatever the political considerations, legal scholars
said, the idea should be rejected because it is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a perversion of the Constitution,'' said Margaret
Russell, who teaches at the University of Santa Clara Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Added Lawrence Sager of the New York University Law School: ``If
they even tried to do this, the precedent would be a very dangerous
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Article 2 of the Constitution sounds unequivocal: the president
or vice president ``shall be removed from office on impeachment for
and conviction of treason, bribery or other high crimes or
misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Joseph Isenbergh, a professor at the University of
Chicago Law School, sees some wiggle room in that phrasing.
Isenberg, who teaches tax law, waded into the constitutional debate
over impeachment with a recent paper arguing that removal from
office was mandated only if the accused was found guilty of high
crimes and misdemeanors _ but not if the crimes were determined to
be of lesser gravity.
</P>
<P>
   Some senators are using an offshoot of Isenberg's writing to pry
a political opening for concluding the trial without seeming to
have capitulated to the Democrats or having lost a partisan war to
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Further details were not available since no formal proposal has
been drafted and ultimately might not be. But a two-thirds majority
of the Senate, or 67 votes, presumably would be needed for either
conviction or removal.
</P>
<P>
   No public official has ever been allowed to remain in office
after being found guilty of impeachable offenses. Despite questions
about the constitutionality of the proposal, the legal analysts
said the senators probably could adopt the plan because no
individual or institution could stop them.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, the Supreme Court could step in, but past rulings
make it clear that impeachment is the sole purview of Congress.
Justice David Souter suggested in a dissent that the court could
intervene if lawmakers took an action that was ``dangerously
unconstitutional,'' but doing so would raise profound questions
about the separation of powers.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, who is presiding over
Clinton's trial, presumably could rule against any measure that
would permit splitting the final votes. Even if he did, however,
the impeachment process allows a simple majority of senators to
overrule the bench on any matter.
</P>
<P>
   Sager differs from many constitutional experts by not basing his
opinion solely on the Constitution's wording. The document, he
argued, should be subject to reinterpretation as social and legal
realities change.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, though, he said that detaching the conviction from
the removal from office would water down impeachment to the point
where it could become a tool for eliminating political opponents,
rather than a complex mechanism for removing elected officials
under extreme circumstances. ``It should be avoided at all costs,''
said Sager.

SENATE EXPERIENCES DELIBERATIONS WITHOUT THE THEATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After weeks of anticipation, the Senate Tuesday
entered into its second night of closed session to deliberate its
most divisive issue: whether witnesses should be called to testify
in the impeachment trial of the president.
</P>
<P>
   But there was another pressing matter. No microphones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have, out of 100 members, a certain percent who are hard of
hearing,'' said Senator Bob Kerrey.
</P>
<P>
   During the Monday meeting, Senator Herbert Kohl agreed: ``We had
to strain.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, senators fixed the problem themselves, hooking up
the sound system and, in a rare step, taking turns speaking from
the Senate well. It was one of a number of unfamiliar elements they
faced during secret deliberations, and as they emerged, most agreed
it made for a somewhat bizarre atmosphere in the chamber _
particularly as senators spoke to each other instead of the
television cameras scattered around the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stripped away the theater because the only people we were
playing to were our colleagues,'' Senator Chuck Hagel, a Republican
from Nebraska, said Tuesday afternoon. ``There was a lot of
listening going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Conversation flowed more freely _ even if at a quieter volume _
in part because of a formal restriction forbidding participants
from talking about it afterward. A senator can be expelled from
Congress for violating the gag rule.
</P>
<P>
   With guards positioned outside the doors, Chief Justice William
H. Rehnquist presided over the deliberations as he has over the
trial itself, calling senators to speak in turn. Nearly everyone
who spoke Tuesday night used the allotted time _ 10 minutes at
first, then five minutes, after senators agreed to shorten the time
as the session wore on _ indicating that publicity is not the only
reason the Senate has a reputation for verbosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're talking as much,'' Senator Edward M. Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Each night they broke for dinner, and on Monday, the meals were
divided along partisan lines, as Republicans feasted on fried
chicken and Democrats ate pizza, ordered by California Senator
Dianne Feinstein, aides said. By Tuesday night, the snacks had
dwindled to more meager fare: pretzels, apples and cookies brought
in by Senate staff.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of food did not deter them from pontificating; Tuesday
night, the session lasted more than three hours, the time allotted
by an earlier consent decree, with only a single 10-minute break.
</P>
<P>
   The talk was ``more personal, more frank,'' according to Senator
John F. Kerry. It was ``a little bit like being in the back room of
a committee,'' Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat from New
York, agreed. Senator Robert F. Bennett, a Republican from Utah,
described the tone as ``very civil and very frank.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some advantages to keeping you folks out,'' Bennett
told a reporter Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey, a Nebraska Democrat, joked that ``it's only useful
because it might make the case that we ought to get the televisions
out of there permanently.'' Kerrey, like 42 other Democrats, had
voted a day earlier to open the sessions to the public following a
motion by Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa _ and said the real
value in the secrecy was observing his publicity-starved
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do I look? Who do I talk to? Where's my staff to tell me
what to say?'' cracked Kerrey, mocking the senators lost in a world
without television. ``It's fun to watch human beings behave when
there's not cameras on them.''
</P>
<P>
   And, despite the enthusiasm for the exchanging of views, the
numerous speeches did not appear to change any minds. As they head
into a vote Wednesday on whether witnesses are to be called, few
senators expect the Republican majority to fail _ a victory that
was effectively secured days before.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl, a Democrat of Wisconsin, said the closed-door sessions
were not ``anymore useful in private than it would have been in
public.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't anything said that could have been said in open
session,'' said Kohl. ``Had you heard them, you would have just
said, `OK.' ''

 &HT;    Super hype begins with Media Day
 &HT;    By Joe Capozzi
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ It started with a police escort up Interstate 95 and a
welcome by a shirtless guy called Barrel Man. It ended 12 hours
later in a beery swing by the bay with Big Bad Voodoo Daddy.
</P>
<P>
   In between, there were football players _ wearing a dog collar,
playing a board game and answering questions like, ``What makes a
guy like you cry?''
</P>
<P>
   We're talking, of course, about Media Day, the annual ritual of
Super Hype that unfolded Tuesday at Pro Player Stadium where a
no-holds-barred circus of more than 1,500 journalists squared off
against the rosters of the Denver Broncos and Atlanta Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   It's meant as a way for the media to take the pulse of the NFC
and AFC championship teams in the week leading up to the biggest
sporting event of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But the reality of Media Day is this: ``It has nothing to do
with football,'' said Broncos tight end Byron Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   OK, it has a little to do with football. But ``it's really kind
of a free-for-all,'' said former Super Bowl executive director Don
Weiss, who has watched Media Day evolve from its 1967 precursor
``Photo Day,'' which attracted 338 media members before the first
NFL Championship game.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days, Media Day often meant reporters entering a
hotel lobby to find a list with a player's name and room number.
``And we'd go knock on his door,'' recalled Vito Stellino of the
Baltimore Sun, a veteran of 25 Media Days.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a light-flashing motorcycle cop led a caravan of bus
coaches from the Hyatt Regency Hotel in downtown Miami _ the
headquarters for the 3,000-strong contigent of media accredited for
Super Bowl XXXIII _ and through rush-hour traffic toward the site
of Sunday's big game.
</P>
<P>
   At Pro Player Stadium, the throng of reporters armed with
microphones, cameras and step ladders (for unobstructed
photographs) was herded through Gate H, the perch of Tim McKernan,
a Broncos fan known as Barrel Man because of his attire.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``a cattle call,'' as one NFL official put it, the herd of
media lumbered onto the field. Lining the sidelines was a flea
market of 10 booths, some with rows of aluminum bleachers erected
in front, each with a sound speakers and a metal pole displaying a
player's name.
</P>
<P>
   Each team was given an hour, which was kept down to the last
second by a ticking clock on the scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   There's Shannon Sharpe, the outspoken Denver Broncos receiver,
sitting like a clown on a dunking platform, talking about his
chlildhood heros. ``Jack Lambert. Jack didn't have any teeth. I
liked him because I didn't have any teeth at the time, either.''
</P>
<P>
   There's Ray Buchanan, the Atlanta Falcons corner back, wearing a
silver-studded dog collar around his neck. ``I bought it at the pet
store. Everyone says we're the underdogs.''
</P>
<P>
   There's John Elway, the Denver Broncos quarterback, who's barely
visible through the skyline of reporters tippy-toed on bleachers
and step ladders but can be heard answering a question for Austrian
television crew: ``This is what American football is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Wandering in the stands and on the sidelines are dozens of more
players, many aiming $700 video cameras at the media frenzy.
``Gotta take home some memories,'' said Cyron Brown, a Broncos
defensive end.
</P>
<P>
   There's Chamberlain, the Denver tight-end, sitting on a
rolled-up tarp, engaged in a game of Operation with teammate Keith
Burns. There's broadcaster Sal Paolantonio of ESPN interviewing
broadcaster Chris Berman of ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   There's Falcons defensive end John Burrough conducting a live
radio interview from his cell phone. And there's cable channel
Comedy Central's own Beth Littleford asking Falcons safety Chris
Bayne: ``How dirty is your bird?''
</P>
<P>
   That was mild compared to some of the classics that players have
been asked at previous Media Days: To Washington quarterback Doug
Williams, ``Have you always been a black quarterback?'' To
Oakland's Jim Plunkett, ``Jim, as that dead father and blind
mother, or dead other and blind father?''
</P>
<P>
   One Atlanta writer earlier this week began a column, directed at
players about the media onslaught: ``While there's still time, let
me take a moment to issue a sincere 'I'm sorry' for what is about
to happen...''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the journalists at Media Day XXXIII asked about Sunday's big
game. And the cliches echoed out the loudspeakers over each other
in stereo _ ``It's David versus Goliath...'' ``It's the dream of a
lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   By 11:30 a.m., the reporters filed out of Pro Player Stadium to
write their stories and prepare for the evening's Media Day party
with swing band Big Bad Voodoo Daddy at Bayfront Park. Several
Denver players said the media seemed well-behaved.
</P>
<P>
   ``One woman asked me about the Monica Lewinsky scandal,'' said
Denver safety Eric Brown. ``I told her I didn't have an opinion.
But if we win the Super Bowl and I get to meet the president, I'm
going to ask him about it.''

VATICAN REVISES EXORCISM RITE BUT SAYS DEVIL EXISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also POPE-U.S., POPE-CLINTON, POPE-JEWS) 
(lb) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Reaffirming that the devil exists and is at work in the
world, the Vatican on Tuesday issued a revised rite of exorcism,
the Roman Catholic ritual for driving out demons. In an apparent
effort to placate liberal Catholics embarrassed by a practice that
seems to echo medieval superstition, the Vatican urged those
performing exorcisms to take pains to distinguish between possessed
people and those suffering from forms of mental or psychological
illness.
</P>
<P>
   Exorcism is an ancient practice of driving the devil from people
believed to be possessed. It remains a source of theological
debate, and in recent years, despite its renewed popularity in the
United States and elsewhere, the church has sought to play down its
significance without shaking the foundations of belief in a
personal source of evil in the world.
</P>
<P>
   By revising the rite of exorcism, the Vatican was following a
mandate of the Second Vatican Council, which met from 1962 to 1965.
It also took the opportunity to urge priests and bishops to seek
professional medical assistance in cases where the true nature of
what seems to be diabolical possession is in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   In a Latin text titled ``De Exorcismis et Supplicationibus
Quibusdam'' (Of Exorcisms and Certain Supplications), the Vatican
cautioned that exorcists ``first of all, must not consider people
to be vexed by demons who are suffering above all from some psychic
illness.'' It cautioned against treating as possessed ``victims of
imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   The 84-page Latin text, which Pope John Paul II approved before
he left for his visit to North America, contains prayers and rites
for driving out devils, but also for cleansing places and things of
demonic influence.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Jorge Arturo Medina Estevez, head of the Vatican
congregation responsible for religious rites, said genuine
possession could be recognized by various criteria, including the
use of unknown languages, extraordinary strength and the disclosure
of hidden occurrences or events. He also mentioned a ``vehement
aversion to God, the Blessed Virgin, the saints, the cross and
sacred images.''
</P>
<P>
   By issuing the text, which replaces a 1614 version, the Vatican
reaffirmed the existence of the devil.
</P>
<P>
   Medina Estevez acknowledged that many modern Catholics no longer
believed in the devil, but he called this a ``serious fault in
religious education,'' adding that the existence of the devil
``belongs to Catholic faith and doctrine.''
</P>
<P>
   Issuing the revised text could ``provide some incentive for the
appointment of more official exorcists,'' said Michael Cuneo, a
Fordham University sociologist who is writing a book on exorcism in
American culture. But he said that despite a ``flourishing market
for exorcisms,'' most Catholic bishops in the United States
considered exorcism ``to be antiquated, to be an embarrassment, to
be a survival of medieval superstition.''

   MIAMI _ Bill Parcells has pulled out of the Pro Bowl. The New
York Jets coach said Tuesday that team doctors told him he would be
better off if he stayed at home instead of joining the Jets'
coaching staff in Honolulu for the Feb. 7 games.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Belichick, the Jets' assistant head coach, will lead the
staff instead.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells had two physicals after the Jets' season ended with a
loss in the AFC Championship game at Denver, and both times doctors
advised him to stay at home and rest. Parcells said he was feeling
very run down, much more than usual, when the season ended.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells and his wife, Judy, went to their Florida vacation home
for at least two weeks.

 &HT;    Don't believe the feud has ended

<P>
   MIAMI _ ``Bygones.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the one-word directive Ally McBeal office boss Richard
Fish issues whenever he wants the firm's lawyers to forget past
disagreements and move immediately on to new business.
</P>
<P>
   It's also what Mike Shanahan, John Elway and Dan Reeves _ Super
Bowl XXXIII's very own Bermuda Triangle _ would have everyone think
is an accurate description of how they view their own past
disagreements.
</P>
<P>
   Don't believe them.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan and Elway, as head coach and star quarterback,
respectively, of the Denver Broncos, would like nothing better
Sunday night than to win (and win big) at the expense of Reeves,
who was once their boss as head coach in Denver but now looms as a
loathsome opponent in charge of the Atlanta Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, too, would like nothing better than to stick it to
Shanahan and Elway.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why it's best to ignore the chorus of ``bygones''
coming from the unholy trinity and wait for the curtain to go up on
what should be a game stuffed full of venomous animosities.
</P>
<P>
   The abridged version of the Reeves-Shanahan-Elway history is
that they won three AFC championships together in Denver, but never
a Super Bowl. Reeves subsequently fired Shanahan, who was his
offensive coordinator, for what he viewed as conduct unbecoming an
underling. And he thought Elway was in cahoots with Shanahan when
it came to usurping authority. Reeves was dismissed himself a year
later, and the guess has long been that Elway had much to do with
the ouster.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan, obviously, later found his way back to Denver in
Reeves' old job, and last year won a Super Bowl with Elway.
</P>
<P>
   There's enough bitterness in all of this to fill a blimp and
float it above Pro Player Stadium even though all parties involved
are busy floating fluff.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves brought the whole mess bubbling back to the surface last
week after the Falcons won the NFC title, but has since apologized
``for opening those wounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway has said ``it's water under the bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan has gone even further: ``I'm glad it's over,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Over? This isn't over. It's just getting started.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that would make Reeves happier than winning the
Super Bowl would be winning it while beating Shanahan and Elway,
whom he considers traitors to his, if not Denver's, cause while
they were working in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Let's just suggest that if the Falcons win, Reeves will make
sure to Dirty Bird-dance on the fresh graves of two Broncos in
particular.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan and Elway, on the other hand, would like to extend
Denver's reign as pro football champions and do so while proving _
on a global stage _ that they never needed Reeves in the first
place. And going 2-0 in Supers without him compared to 0-3 with him
would be a ferocious kick in Reeves' teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Let's just suggest that if the Broncos are ahead, 38-3, on the
Falcons and threatening to score late (as they were, you'll
remember, against the Dolphins a few weeks back), nobody's going to
be taking a knee in a show of mercy.
</P>
<P>
   Don't believe what you're hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Don't believe Reeves' apology ``for ever having brought it up.''
Why? Because it's at least possible it was a premeditated ploy
aimed at distracting the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   Don't believe Elway's re-evaluation of his relationship with
Reeves when he says ``there were a lot more positive times in
Denver than negative ... a lot more.'' Why? Because he once said it
was ``hell'' playing for the man.
</P>
<P>
   And don't believe Shanahan's posture of goodwill when he says
what Reeves ``has done in Atlanta in such a short time is
remarkable.'' Why? Because he knows winning consecutive Super Bowl
titles is what would be remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   Don't believe in ``bygones.''
</P>
<P>
   Believe something else.
</P>
<P>
   Believe that Sunday will prove living well really is the best
revenge.

THE BRAZIL EFFECT ON COMMODITIES: FORGET THE NEW TRACTOR
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Midwestern farm-belt states, including Ind., Ill., N.D.,
S.D., Iowa, Idaho) (nk) 
By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ From a pit on the floor of the Chicago Board of Trade,
Steven P. Bruce has been watching events in Brazil make the prices
of wheat and soybeans swing with impunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``All commodity prices have been slipping,'' he said, shouting
above a crowd of futures traders who were bidding down the
long-term prices of a variety of commodities. ``We will sell less
wheat to Brazil and they will compete with us on soybeans; it's
that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   While the overall economy remains vibrant, calculations by
futures traders like Bruce are an indication that the crisis in
Brazil is already reverberating in the United States _ both
positively and negatively. As the value of Brazil's currency, the
real, has dropped by more than a third in the last two weeks, the
wholesale prices of a broad range of goods, including wheat and
soybeans, have fallen 7 percent, according to key measures of
commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the benchmark Commodities Research Bureau/Bridge index
reached another recent low Tuesday, settling at 187.60, down 0.93.
</P>
<P>
   All this comes on top of double-digit declines in the last few
years. Prices for basic industrial products like steel have been
similarly hit by events in Brazil. These declines are sending new
shock waves through the United States' grain belt and industrial
heartland.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, the drop in wholesale prices means that inflation
_ which has been lower than at any time in recent decades _ is even
more likely to remain in check. But economists and retailers say
the lower wholesale prices will not necessarily translate into
broadly falling prices at the supermarket or the auto showroom.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, bakers, benefiting from lower wheat and flour
prices, will probably enjoy fatter profits. And auto manufacturers,
who get just modest gains from the falling price of steel, will
have a little more margin to play with.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even if consumers are not reaping all the benefits of the
drop in commodity prices, most economists see the outlook for
inflation as extremely favorable. And as long as most Americans
enjoy real pocketbook gains _ wage gains go further in the absence
of inflation _ the U.S. economy should continue to enjoy steady
growth this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd have to go back to the 1960s to see this kind of
environment,'' said Patrick Jackman, an economist at the Bureau of
Labor Statistics, which calculates the nation's consumer price
index. ``While lower commodity prices might not generally translate
into sharp declines in consumer prices, they translate into more
stable prices. And viewing it from the point of view of the
consumer, if you find that prices have not gone up, you're usually
satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, commodity prices started to decline well before
Brazil stopped defending its currency earlier this month. Financial
crises that began a year and a half ago and swept through Asia and
Russia had already begun to dry up the demand for commodities
worldwide, including some mainstays of the Midwest. And with steep
currency devaluations in countries like South Korea, American
exports have been competing against cheaper goods, forcing
depressed prices lower. Brazil's problems have deepened the crisis
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil is really reinforcing the slowdown in the global
economy,'' said James E. Glassman, a senior economist at Chase
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   At its simplest, Brazil's decision to devalue its currency means
that the country will reduce imports while exporting its own
cheaper products like iron and steel, soybeans, wheat and coffee.
That could cause lower commodity prices throughout Latin America,
forcing U.S. producers to sell their commodities for even less, and
in some cases much less.
</P>
<P>
   But while consumers and a lot of manufacturers have seen
benefits from lower commodity prices, many basic industrial and
agriculture-related companies have been suffering for months from
the various foreign financial crises.
</P>
<P>
   Cargill, the nation's largest private company and shipper of
much of the world's grain, has lost money in the last two quarters.
USX, which operates U.S. Steel, has idled one of its blast furnaces
in Gary, Ind., and laid off contract workers.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Steel, which supplies galvanized steel to the auto industry
that is usually sold on long-term contract, may have to lower its
prices to compete with cheaper foreign imports. The price of
soybeans, already down 40 percent from two years ago, may have to
fall further because of decreased demand in Asia and elsewhere. In
trading Tuesday at the Chicago Board of Trade, soybeans for March
delivery settled at $5.14 a bushel, down 3.5 cents, a four-month
closing low.
</P>
<P>
   Economists say that ripples from the slowdown overseas are
already causing losses for the nation's farmers. Problems are
particularly acute across the northern tier of states _ from
Illinois, where farmers are getting a cash price of just $2.07 for
a bushel of corn, down from $3.97 a few years ago, to Idaho, where
wheat is being sold at $2.69 a bushel, down from $5.49 a few years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This industry is not well,'' said Bill Flory, president of the
National Association of Wheat Growers, noting that many farmers in
North and South Dakota are putting their land up for sale. ``It's a
liquidation year for the industry, and there's not a lot of light
at the end of the tunnel.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Midwestern farmers are storing their corn and soybeans in
huge grain elevators, in hope that prices will bounce back. But the
Agriculture Department projects that 1999 could be just as weak as
1998, with farm exports expected to decline 10 percent from their
already depressed levels.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of looking ahead to next year's crops, many farmers are
retrenching, holding off on fertilizer purchases or that new pickup
truck, and depressing those merchants' business.
</P>
<P>
   ``If farmers don't make money they don't replace their
equipment,'' said Larry Mitchell, an Agriculture Department
spokesman. ``It means the local equipment dealer doesn't make the
sale. The people who haul the equipment don't have anything to
haul. The equipment maker doesn't make the equipment. This all
begins to ripple.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Deere &AMP; Co., the nation's largest maker of farm equipment, said
in November that it would lay off 2,400 workers, or 7 percent of
its work force after demand for its tractors and combines
plummeted. Now, with recession in Brazil, the company's problems
are mounting.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer farmers, for instance, are lining up to purchase Deere's
new, $160,000 Maximizer combine. ``People are cutting back,'' said
Dick Gady, chief economist at Conagra, the giant food-processing
company. ``Two dollar corn doesn't buy them a lot of combines.''
</P>
<P>
   Just about any company that makes heavy equipment for the farm
is being hurt. Even Caterpillar, which is the world's largest maker
of earth-moving equipment, has seen its profit growth slow.
</P>
<P>
   Cargill, which has more than 80,000 employees in 65 countries,
says that its once-vibrant grain trade is sagging, and there has
been weaker demand for food products in emerging nations. ``People
out there just don't have the purchasing power to buy more food and
better food,'' said Linda Thrane, a Cargill spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, the steel industry has asked the
government to impose higher import duties on Japan, Russia and
Brazil, asserting that they are dumping steel at a loss into
markets here. In the last few months, several smaller steel
companies have filed for bankruptcy protection. And bigger
steelmakers are reeling. On Friday, for instance, U.S. Steel
reported a 50 percent drop in profit from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go back to the 1970s, when the steel industry had it
tough, it looks like that all over again,'' said William Szakacs,
50, an employee at Gary Works, the U.S. Steel mill in Gary, Ind.,
that is the largest in North America. ``Things are getting tighter
every day. There's not a lot of steel to roll.''
</P>
<P>
   For other companies as well as most consumers, the commodity
collapse has brought benefits. Oil prices have declined because of
slowing global demand, cutting transportation costs for big
companies as well as for millions of Americans filling their tanks
at gasoline stations.
</P>
<P>
   Other commodities are more complex. In automobiles, for example,
steel is just one component. There is only $700 worth of steel in a
$25,000 vehicle, so prices will not be affected sharply, steel
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   And when it comes to food _ coffee, sugar, corn, soybeans for
cooking oil and wheat _ Americans are not seeing significantly
lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even though the commodity price of wheat has plummeted
40 percent in the last two years, bread prices have increased
slightly, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Food companies and retailers contend that is because commodities
make up a small part of their expenses, which include labor and
manufacturing costs, as well as substantial processing,
transportation and marketing expenses. Many economists say that, in
fact, food companies and retailers, particularly those that operate
on low margins, enjoy heftier profits when wholesale prices drop.
</P>
<P>
   So while Flory, who grows wheat on 7,000 acres of farmland in
northern Idaho, sells his grain at some of the lowest prices in a
decade, a company like Interstate Bakeries, the distributor of
products like Wonder Bread and Hostess Twinkies, holds prices
steady.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question from a cost perspective, a bakery would
benefit from lower wheat prices,'' said Mark Dirkes, an Interstate
spokesman. ``Flour is the single largest commodity we purchase.''
</P>
<P>
   For every $1 decline in the wholesale price of wheat, he said,
Interstate plans to pass along a 1.5-cent saving to the consumer.
Still, despite the windfall from cheaper wheat, he said that the
bottom line declined at Interstate in the most recent quarter,
primarily because of fierce competition and higher operating costs,
including labor.

SENATE MOVES CLOSER TO CALLING 3 MAJOR WITNESSES IN IMPEACHMENT

 By R. W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fervent arguments from the prosecution and defense
counsel on the highly divisive question of calling witnesses in
President Clinton's impeachment trial, followed by a second
straight evening of closed-door debate, moved the Senate closer on
Tuesday night to a decision to take depositions from three of the
main figures in the protracted proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers, fighting a rear-guard action against new
testimony, warned again that witnesses would delay the trial for
weeks _ a tactic that brought irked resposes from Republicans.
David S. Kendall, who heads the president's private legal team,
compared the prosecutors to Mr. Micawber in Dickens' ``David
Copperfield:'' ``always hoping something would turn up.''
</P>
<P>
   On the brief list of potential witnesses, announced by House
prosecutors in the Senate on Tuesday morning, were Monica S.
Lewinsky, whose illicit sexual relationship with the president led
to his impeachment; Vernon Jordan, the Washington lawyer who sought
a job for Ms. Lewinsky, and Sidney Blumenthal, a White House
adviser to whom Clinton gave a false account of the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   All can be subpoenaed. The Republican prosecutors from the House
also urged the Senate to ``request the appearance'' of Clinton
himself, who was in St. Louis meeting Pope John Paul II. His
lawyers and spokesman have repeatedly said he will not appear, and
a subpoena would be of doubtful validity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two people who know the most about this are Monica
Lewinsky and William Jefferson Clinton,'' said Rep. Bill McCollum
of Florida, opening the prosecutors' arguments that they should be
heard again.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate will vote on two pivotal issues on Wednesday: whether
to dismiss the case against the president, as proposed by Sen.
Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, a Democrat, and whether to
authorize the depositions from witnesses. The Byrd motion seems all
but certain to lose, but the proposal for depositions, top
Democrats conceded, now has a better than even chance to be
approved.
</P>
<P>
   Simple majorities are required on both the procedural issues.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night's debate on witnesses was shorter but more
passionate, one senator said, than Monday night's on dismissal _
perhaps because the witness issue remains in doubt. The senator,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said the discussion was not so
much bitter or partisan as highly animated.
</P>
<P>
   At least at first, the three witnesses would not appear in the
chamber where the impeachment drama has now played out over 10
tense days. They would testify in private, with only lawyers
present, although the appearances would probably be videotaped. The
Senate would have to vote anew, after it had reviewed the
depositions, if it wanted them to testify in public.
</P>
<P>
   Facing probable defeat, with several Republican senators
threatening to vote against calling witnesses, the House
prosecutors, or managers, made two important concessions that
seemed to stiffen the resolve of some waverers. They agreed to
settle for depositions instead of live testimony, and they cut back
their witness list to what Rep. Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, the
beleaguered lead prosecutor, described as ``a pitiful three.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal's name on the short list came as something of a
surprise. He testified to the grand jury that Clinton told him,
contrary to the facts, that Ms. Lewinsky had stalked him, and the
prosecution has charged that the president did so in an effort to
pass lies on to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant omission from the House list was Betty
Currie, Clinton's secretary, who was involved not only in hiding
the gifts Clinton gave Ms. Lewinsky but also in a celebrated
episode where Clinton appeared to ``coach'' her, the prosecution
contends, in anticipation of her later testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall argued that witnesses would be superfluous, noting that
the House had called none during its impeachment proceedings. He
laid heavy emphasis on the extent of evidence collected by the
independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr _ ``10,000 pages of grand
jury testimony; over 800 pages of olther testimony, such as
depositions; 3,400 pages of documentary evidence, 1,800 pages of
audio transcripts and 800-and-some pages of FBI interviews.''
</P>
<P>
   `I will certainly say this for Mr. Starr,'' Kendall said. ``He
is thorough. He is thorough.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the House prosecutors ``sang a different song,'' he
said, quoting several of them as dismissing the need for witnesses.
Hyde, Kendall told the senators, had said on Nov. 5: ``We believe
the most relevant witnesses have already testified at length about
the matters at issue.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM CAN START HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Kendall also played for the Senate several videotapes of Jordan
speaking to reporters after emerging from his grand jury
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came here in March,'' Jordan said on June 9, as
recorded on videotape, ``I said that I helped Ms. Lewinsky get a
lawyer, I helped her get a job, I had assurances there was no
sexual relationship, and I did not tell her to lie. That was the
truth then, and that is the truth today. And I have testified five
times, over and over again, to those truths.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors also asked the Senate on Tuesday to admit into
evidence a sworn declaration of T. Wesley Holmes, a lawyer for
Paula Jones, whose sexual harassment suit against Clinton led to
the revelation of the Lewinsky affair; an affidavit of Barry Ward,
law clerk to U.S. District Court Judge Susan Webber Wright, who
presided over the Jones suit, and telephone records of
conversations between Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky, particularly a
56-minute talk they had on Dec. 6, 1997, the day Clinton learned
she was on the Jones witness list.
</P>
<P>
   Ward, who was present at the time of Clinton's deposition in the
Jones case on Jan. 17, 1998, apparently commented on whether the
president seemed to be paying attention when he allowed his lawyer,
Robert S. Bennett, to make untrue statements about the president's
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. Holmes' document, McCollum said,
was three paragraphs long and concerned his decision to call Mrs.
Currie to give evidence in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be expeditious'' if the Senate votes to admit this
evidence and to call witnesses, Kendall said. But he added: ``In
the event the genie is out of the bottle, we need time, we need
access to defend the president in the way any client ought to be
defended.'' And that, he said, would mean extensive ``discovery'' _
depositions and the gathering of other evidence.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM CAN END HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ed Bryant of Tennessee said the prosecutors had originally
planned to ask for as many as 15 witnesses. The three persons
finally chosen, he said, gave ``the broadest coverage'' of the
impeachment articles, because they could testify on seven of eight
charges of obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky could help resolve the crucial conflict in
testimony as to the nature of her sexual contact with the
president, Bryant said. Ms. Lewinsky has said under oath that
Clinton touched her breasts and genital area, and Clinton, also
under oath, denied it. Bryant pledged that she could deal with
``salacious questions'' without mentioning ``those words.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, she could testify on the gifts and who it
was who asked her to hide them.
</P>
<P>
   It fell to Rep. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas to outline, in part,
the kinds of information the prosecutors would seek from Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, he said he wanted to ask Jordan and Ms.
Lewinsky whether she had given him an advance look at a false
affidavit she was preparing to file after he got her a job in New
York, and whether he had urged her to get rid of notes that she had
written to the president. On some issues, he said, Jordan had never
been questioned, because they came up after his last day of
testimony. Defense lawyers denied this.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth should be determined,'' Hutchinson contended.
``Justice should be accomplished. That is done not through lawyers
up here talking, it's done not through transcripts, but through
witnesses.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rep. James E. Rogan of California, another one of the managers,
rebutted the defense argument that no witnesses were needed now
because none had been called in the House, when the Republicans had
the chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the constitutional responsibility of the House of
Representatives to act as the accusatory body in an impeachment
proceeding,'' he said. ``The Constitution gives the authority to
this body to try that case. This is the place for trial. This is
the place to determine guilt. This is the place to determine
credibility. This is the place for witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   As it has so often in this case, the last word went to Hyde.
</P>
<P>
   ``The threat of prolonged hearings, I suppose, is supposed to
make you tremble,'' the prosecutor said. ``It doesn't to me, but
then different strokes, I guess, for different folks.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Sens. Tom Harkin of Iowa and Paul D. Wellstone of
Minnesota, both Democrats, moved to suspend the Senate rules to
open the debate on witnesses to the public and to television
cameras. Once again, they failed, this time on a 41-58 vote.

   WASHINGTON _ As a response to Iraq's concerted challenge to U.S.
aircraft, President Clinton has within the last month expanded the
powers of military flight crews to fight back when threatened while
enforcing the no-flight zones over northern and southern Iraq, the
president's national security adviser acknowledged Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our pilots understand, and our Air Force understands, that if
there are violations of the no-fly zone, that our response be not
simply against the particular source of the violation or source of
the threat,'' said National Security Adviser Samuel Berger. ``But
our response, as appropriate, will be against any of the air
defense systems that we think makes us vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger disclosed the change in policy at a breakfast for
reporters covering the military.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Department officials confirmed Tuesday that one of the
U.S. missiles launched on Monday had missed its target by at least
18 miles and struck a residential neighborhood in Basra in southern
Iraq. Eleven civilians were killed, the Iraqi government said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the four-day air campaign against Iraq in December, U.S.
planes have encountered nearly daily provocations from
surface-to-air missiles, ground fire and radar installations while
patrolling the zones over southern and northern Iraq, the Pentagon
says.
</P>
<P>
   The zones were set up to protect Iraqi Kurds and Shiite Muslims
from attacks by President Saddam Hussein's government. But until
Tuesday the Pentagon had not admitted that it had increased the
authorization to respond beyond earlier rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're responding in a different way, and it's not
tit-for-tat,'' said a Defense Department official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``Now if you challenge us, you threaten us,
we'll respond in the way we think best reduces the threat to our
pilots.``
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The bombing in Basra on Monday highlighted the risks of the new
policy, which Pentagon officials said was aimed at protecting
pilots patrolling the no-flight zones.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the pilots may now attack a variety of
installations within Iraq's air defense system even if those sites
were not the immediate source of action against American planes.
</P>
<P>
   In acknowledging the errant missile Tuesday, Kenneth Bacon, the
spokesman for Defense Secretary William Cohen, said: ``We regret
any civilian casualties,'' although he said U.S. officials had ``no
independent confirmation'' that the missile had killed any Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, U.S. planes attacked five sites in the northern
no-flight zone after hostile action by Iraqi forces, the Defense
Department said.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Steve Campbell said Iraqi anti-aircraft artillery
systems near Mosul had targeted the U.S. planes with radar,
indicating a possible intention to shoot them down. In response,
two F-15Es dropped precision-guided bombs. Earlier in the day, U.S.
planes fired on three other sites in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The new bombing policy builds on what Berger described as the
increasing diplomatic isolation and resulting frustration of
Saddam. On Sunday, Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Said Sahaf
walked out of an Arab League meeting in Cairo when the assembled
diplomats urged Saddam to comply with United Nations resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam's growing antipathy toward his neighbors as well as his
attacks on U.S. planes, Berger said, ``reflects a man who is off
balance.''
</P>
<P>
   The new U.S. policy reflects the new situation after the
evacuation from Iraq of experts from the U.N. Special Commission,
which had made fitful progress toward finding and destroying
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Now with little hope of resuming the commission's mission, the
United States has fallen back on a policy of containing Iraq, to
keep it from using its weapons against its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   After giving up on persuading Saddam to live up to United
Nations demands for disarmament, the United States is again calling
for the overthrow of the Iraqi leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``While publicly saying this is a regime that should go, we're
reverting to a containment policy,'' said William Quandt, professor
of government and foreign affairs at the University of Virginia.
``But containment's not terribly sexy. We lived with it with the
Soviet Union for 50 years and it worked. But it takes patience.''
</P>
<P>
   And Saddam's actions and language consistently provoke the ire
and impatience of the United States, to the dismay of its allies.
Only Britain gave the United States full support in its air attacks
on Iraq in December. At the United Nations, Canada and France have
submitted alternative proposals for dealing with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   In Baghdad on Tuesday, Saddam pressed his case against the
United States and said in a message about the civilians who were
reported to have died in Basra: ``Your blood will not have been
spilled in vain. Your blood will give flower to the tree of
freedom, resistance and victory.''

ROMANOWSKI STILL ON A HITTING STREAK  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ When last seen on a football field, Bill Romanowski was
being ever so gingerly helped to the sideline to find his sense of
direction after losing it in a violent collision with Curtis
Martin.
</P>
<P>
   This was two Sundays ago. Romanowski, the Broncos' Pro Bowl
linebacker, had just stopped Martin, the Jets' running back, in the
American Football Conference championship game.
</P>
<P>
   But wait. Isn't this the same Bill Romanowski who has been
labeled ``the best-conditioned athlete I ever coached,'' according
to his coach, Mike Shanahan. The same Bill Romanowski who says,
``When you get a good hit on someone, it doesn't hurt''?
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that hit didn't look good,'' Romanowski said Tuesday.
``But I was fine. I was able to get my balance back.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he wound up as the game's leading tackler with 11
takedowns. Along the way, he produced a key first-half hit on
fullback Keith Byars that dislodged the ball deep in Denver
territory and resulted in one of six Jets turnovers that helped
propel the Broncos to Sunday's Super Bowl showdown with Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 32, having made the Pro Bowl for the second time,
and producing what, in his opinion, might be his finest season,
Romanowski will now use all his wiles and his guile to get the
upper hand on anyone in a Falcons uniform. Much will be spent
banging into Atlanta's 6-foot-7-inch, 270-pound tight end, O.J.
Santiago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to take a player out of his zone, any way I can,''
Romanowski said. ``Some guys, you get in their face and they start
reacting. I'll yell something about a family member, or something
personal.''
</P>
<P>
   But wait, this is the new Romanowski, so he added: ``Santiago's
a big guy and if I tried that he'd probably work even harder. So
I'll just try to beat him with great technique.''
</P>
<P>
   Romanowski said Tuesday that he remains contrite over the most
notorious incident of his career, one that has overshadowed the
fact that he has played on two Super Bowl winners in San Francisco
and a third in Denver. The incident occurred last season, during a
Monday night game against the 49ers, when Romanowski spit at
receiver J.J. Stokes.
</P>
<P>
   The action was spotted on instant replay, and Romanowski was
fined $7,500 by the league. Because Romanowski is white and Stokes
is black, the incident also took on racial overtones and
Romanowski's own teammate Shannon Sharpe, the outspoken tight end,
said he thought the linebacker had gotten off too easy.
</P>
<P>
   The Stokes fine was the second of 1997 for Romanowski. The first
was $20,000 for a helmet-to-helmet hit against Kerry Collins, then
the quarterback for the Carolina Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of what happened last year, I'm a better person and a
better player than I was,'' said Romanowski, referring to the
Stokes incident. He spoke in his typical off-the-field fashion _
thoughtfully and softly. ``I vowed to myself and to my family it
would never happen again. When emotion is high, logic is slow.''
</P>
<P>
   As the strongside linebacker, Romanowski routinely has to handle
the opposing tight end, as well as perform the usual duties of
halting runners and receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Because Romanowski is so adept at what he does, the Falcons
decided to imitate him in practice, using backup linebacker Craig
Sauer as the stand-in. And what did Sauer do to Santiago? ``I held
him,'' Sauer said. ``Romanowski's very good. He knows the tricks.
You wonder how he does them. But he's a hard worker. You can see
him running around finishing every play.''
</P>
<P>
   Romanowski got his first two Super Bowl rings in his first two
seasons in the league _ as a 49er in 1988 and 1989. San Francisco
traded him to Philadelphia after the 1993 season and he stayed
there for two years before Shanahan brought him to the Broncos as a
free agent for the 1996 season. He proceeded to make the Pro Bowl
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought his personality was important to the football
team,'' Shanahan said in explaining why he recruited him. ``He
works out 365 days a year. After Sunday's game, he will work out
four hours.''
</P>
<P>
   One Falcon who knows all about Romanowski is the backup center,
Dave Widell, who was a Boston College teammate of Romanowski's,
whom he calls Billy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a typical Boston College guy,'' Widell said. ``It can be
summed up easily. They tend to be great interviews, great family
guys, someone you want to have dinner with. Once you got them on
the field, there's a switch. I was on the dirtiest players list in
Sports Illustrated. By dirty, if you mean do I love to play till
the whistle, yes, and I think Billy plays the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   When told of Widell's comments, Romanowski responded: ``I had a
scratch under my face mask where he tore at my face. I think the
way we play is typical of guys from the school. A lot of people
call me an overachiever. But if that's part of it, I'm guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Romanowski claims he doesn't even think of football as
a tough business. ``They say if you like what you do, you never
have to work a day in your life,'' he said. ``I've been on a
ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Robinson, the Broncos' defensive coordinator, recalled
meeting Romanowski and telling the linebacker that ``we wanted a
confidant who's an extension of the coaches, a guy in the core who
could explain what we're looking for.'' Romanowski became that
person, Robinson said, ``and it helped us.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came the spitting incident, which happened in the
next-to-last game of the regular season. ``I talked to him about
that,'' Robinson said. ``I told him, `Be you and don't worry about
it.' I think afterward he started to worry what people thought, but
those around him knew who he was, it was him and his gamesmanship,
being his feisty self. You can't be less than what you are.''  &QL;

 How to Tap Into Venture Capital Pool  &HT;       
 By Peter Sinton  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  Venture capital is usually hard to get without a track
record and blue chip contacts. Can you suggest ways to find private
equity financing quickly and easily, preferably online?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  You probably won't snare $1 million by simply
broadcasting your business plan over the Internet. But there are
more than a dozen services specifically designed to post
information and introduce needy entrepreneurs to venture capital
firms and deep-pocket individual investors known as angels.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some online services you might start with:
</P>
<P>
   _ Garage.com ( &LR; www.garage.com &LR; ) calls itself a farm club for
venture capital firms. Since last October, the Web-based Palo Alto
company headed by former Apple Computer ``chief evangelist'' Guy
Kawasaki has been matching high-tech and medical science startups
in need of seed capital with investors.
</P>
<P>
   About 25 entrepreneurs contact Garage.com each day. But only a
fortunate few _ about 3 percent _ survive Garage.com's rigorous
screening process, says VP of Business Development Bill Joos. They
are referred on to a network of 130 venture capital firms, 60
corporate investors and hundreds of angels.
</P>
<P>
   Garage.com charges investors a membership fee. Entrepreneurs pay
no application fee but they do have to fork over a percentage of
the $500,000 to $1.5 million they may eventually raise.
</P>
<P>
   Garage.com also has started a monthly forum where entrepreneurs
make live presentations. At the end of March, it also will hold a
two-day ``Bootcamp for Startups'' conference in Mountain view
(cost: $395). Other Bay Area organizations that hold forums include
Band of Angels and San Francisco law firm Niesar &AMP; Diamond's Angel
Law Forum ( &LR; www.ndlaw.com &LR; ).
</P>
<P>
   _ Venture Capital Online ( &LR; www.vcapital.com &LR; ), started by
Chicago venture capitalist Leonard Batterson, has an office in San
Francisco. This week it is launching a Web site that streamlines
the process of matching entrepreneurs with venture capital
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Among the nearly 30 early members who paid $2,000 to join the
venture capital clearinghouse are a unit of Allstate and Hambrecht
&AMP; Quist Venture Capital.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone can take a free look at the Web site, which includes
venture capital market information, capital raising guidelines and
other resources.
</P>
<P>
   Entrepreneurs who submit applications and business plans pay $99
to have Venture Capital Online screen, match and refer investment
opportunities to its members based on their investment preferences.
Entrepreneurs pay more for additional services plus a percentage of
any capital they raise.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of GROW27 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;   &UR;  &LR;  _ The Small Business Administration's Angel Capital Electronic
Network ( &LR; www.sba.gov/ &LR;   &LR; services/acenet.html &LR; ), is an Internet
listing service that is designed to link entrepreneurs looking for
$250,000 to $5 million with accredited investors, accountants and
securities attorneys nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The government-sponsored program also provides links to
university and nonprofit organizations that can help develop
business plans.
</P>
<P>
   Hiring on the Cheap
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are ways a startup operating on a shoe string can find
and recruit an energetic and experienced marketing assistant? We
can only pay about $500 a week and offer few benefits.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; A: Several books such as ``Small Business Kit for Dummies''
(IDG Books, $24.99) by San Francisco lawyer Richard Harroch, give
some pointers.
</P>
<P>
   You might not be able to afford an employment agency or
headhunter. But you probably can offer employees a ``bounty''
(perhaps a few hundred dollars) to recruit the right candidate. You
also might hire a temp and, if it works out, offer the person a
full-time position.
</P>
<P>
   Harroch says the tried-and-true method of advertising in
newspaper and trade magazines still works, as does posting
opportunities on your business' Web site or on job-related Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Use your Internet search engine to find these sites. They
include &LR;  www.careermosaic.com, www.intellimatch.com, &LR; 
 &LR; www.selectjobs.com &LR; ,  &LR; www.espan.com &LR; , &LR;  www.careerpath.com &LR; ,
Virtual Job Fair's  &LR; www.vjf.com &LR; , Monster Board's  &LR; www.monster.com &LR; 
and Online Career Center's &LR;  www.occ.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Posting job openings and company information on these sites
often costs $100 to $200. You also can access newspaper ads online.
For example, Chronicle classifieds (as well as stories) can be
found at  &LR; www.sfgate.com.  &LR; Many other papers post ads on
 &LR; www.careerpath.com &LR;
</P>
<P>
   One of your best bets might be to use JobTrak
( &LR; www.jobtrak.com &LR; ). The Los Angeles company has partnerships with
850 college and university career centers and alumni associations
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to place an ad on one campus, the charge is $18 a
month. But if you want to reach all 40 Bay Area colleges, from
Berkeley and Stanford to Foothill to Cal State Hayward, the charge
is $145 a month. JobTrak posted more than 400,000 jobs last year,
and co-founder Ken Ramberg says you can target the colleges of your
choice and link your ad to your company's home page.

 &HT;    Andersen's silent kicks
 &HT;    By Ethan Skolnick
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Kickers are generally different, commonly
individualists. But Morten Andersen is extreme, the Henry David
Thoreau of kickers, who has seen the solar eclipse in the Guadalupe
Canal, hiked through the Himalayas on Marco Polo's trade route,
even seen monks levitate, though he concedes that may be
exaggeration.
</P>
<P>
   He has been ''mentally naked,'' realized ''you're just a small
part of the world,'' gotten ''the sense of being on a planet,'' and
concluded that ''we're really dust to dust, we're small entitities,
and what we're doing here guys, in the larger scheme of things, is
not going to be defining.''
</P>
<P>
   It makes one wonder what this great Dane's doing here, in the
NFL, in his 17th season, in the twilight of a Hall of Fame-worthy
career. But wonderment stops when his starts, as he speaks in
transcendental terms about striking the ball, when his mind is
clear and he is ''just being.'' Kicking is his Walden Pond.
</P>
<P>
   ''You almost don't hear the ball making contact,'' said
Andersen, who kicked an overtime 38-yarder at Minnesota on Dec. 17,
the 26th game-winner of his career. ''It's so fluid and smooth. The
ball jumps off your foot, it's gone and it's end-over-end and
pretty. If you don't force it, it's a real treat. It's a lot of fun
when you hit the ball pure.''
</P>
<P>
   He shares these deep thoughts in English, the one of five
mastered languages he uses to wish Jean Baker a happy Mother's Day
each year. Jean and her husband Dale took him into their
Indianapolis home was an exchange student his senior year. Andersen
was born in Struer, Denmark, populated by 9,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''I came here to open my mind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So he didn't mind going with Dale Baker and his son to a
football jamboree on his 17th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a foreign exchange student, you don't really have much
information on a kid, just the front and back of a form,'' said
Baker, an offensive guard at Indiana St. ''He wrote that one of his
interests was football. Dumb old me, I know football. Well, he was
talking soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bob Wilbur's son Tim, a star quarterback and defensive
back, was supposed to be the kicker. But Andersen got a Saturday
tryout, and Baker recalls ''90 kids, lining up, bug-eyed, watching
this guy kick, trying to figure out why he was upset when he missed
from 50 yards.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Thirty yards, 40 yards, 50 yards, the things were still going
through,'' Andersen said.
</P>
<P>
   He was a kicking prodigy, if not a football one. Wilbur told him
to ''haul to the sidelines'' after kicking off, and Andersen did
more tumbling (on the gymnastics team) than he did tackling.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never been a football player,'' Andersen said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Michigan State signed him to replace their graduating
Danish kicker Hans Nilsson, and Morten called his mother Hanne, to
say he was staying four more years. In 1982, Saints coach Bum
Phillips would call, asking if Andersen liked Budweiser and country
music.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen, naturally, would say yes. He sees putting his new
house together as a ''journey in itself,'' and says that talking to
reporters on Super Bowl media day was ''something I've visualized
for many years.'' He doesn't close his mind to much.
</P>
<P>
   Football, however, did stump him for a time. ''Have you ever
tried to explain our game of football to a foreigner?'' Baker asks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got into college, and I figured it would be a good idea to
learn the rules,'' Andersen said. ''I thought it was a slow-moving
game. They were constantly stopping the game, it wasn't as fluid as
I was used to. As I learned the game, I became fascinated by it.''
</P>
<P>
   He has tried to introduce it to Danes, doing color commentary on
the past several Super Bowls. ''It's interesting calling the game
in Danish, because I could get away with a few things,'' Andersen
said. ''I'm not pretending that I know all the nuances of football.
I'm not John Madden.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Andersen would work off an American network's feed, and
need to explain why Madden was scribbling on a lineman's stomach.
''He could be talking about what the guy had for breakfast,''
Andersen said.
</P>
<P>
   American football is still ''not a big sport in Denmark,''
trailing soccer and team handball, according to Ekstra Bladet
reporter Troel Christensen, who came to interview Andersen. The
major Danish networks had balked at covering the game _ which airs
at midnight their time _ this year, until Andersen's kick beat
Minnesota. TV-2 outbid TV-3 for the rights Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Lassen, a Berlingske Tidende reporter, was an Danish
exchange student in Georgia. And a kicker. ''A 50-yard field goal
isn't that hard in practice, but under pressure,'' Lassen said.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen has kicked 35 field goals from that far, plus one from
60 yards and one from 59. Broncos kicker Jason Elam has a record
63-yarder.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope there are some big kicks Sunday,'' said Andersen, who
is bringing the Bakers to watch.
</P>
<P>
   If he misses a kick, he'll accept it as he did after a shank put
Jacksonville in the playoffs in 1996. ''I've realized that one kick
is not going to define my career,'' he says. With some kickers, it
has. Andersen called Scott Norwood's miss in the 1991 Super Bowl,
and now calls the reaction ``a shame.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't carry ''mental luggage.'' He needs his mind for the
spiritual stuff, on trips like the one with friends through that
Guadalupe Canal in the Caribbean, where the moon lined up behind
the sun: ``I saw birds nesting, the sea became calm, almost a
pinkish hue in the sky, it was really bizarre.''
</P>
<P>
   Bizarre?

EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS MAY BE LINKED TO LA NINA
</HEADLINE>
 
(REPEATING to add SCI- prefix to slug; no other changes)  (bl) 
By WILLIAM K. STEVENS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Record snows in Buffalo, N.Y., and Chicago. Record numbers of
tornadoes in the country's midsection. All-time low temperatures in
Indiana and Maine. Double the normal amount of precipitation,
coupled with an extended warm spell, in New York. What accounts for
this month's run of extreme weather?
</P>
<P>
   One big factor, experts say, is probably La Nina: an abnormally
cold pool of water stretching across the equatorial Pacific that
causes far-flung changes in the atmosphere's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   La Nina may not be as familiar as its opposite number, El Nino,
which warms the Pacific instead of cooling it. It does not appear
as often, and its impact is somewhat less predictable and
clear-cut. But this winter, government scientists say, its
interaction with routine climate behavior has produced an unusual
run of weather in North America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's La Nina plus the normal chaotic variability of the
atmosphere,'' said Dr. Gerry Bell, a researcher at the Climate
Prediction Center of the National Weather Service in Camp Springs,
Md. While no single weather event can be directly attributed to La
Nina (or to El Nino, for that matter), it has been ``a big player''
in this winter's events, Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, says the Weather Service, more of the same appears
in the cards for the rest of the winter. ``Everyone should be
prepared, because extreme weather may reoccur this cold season,''
Ed O'Lenic, one of Bell's colleagues, said in an advisory issued
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The El Nino-La Nina cycle is wholly natural. But some scientists
believe that extreme weather generally is increasing as a result of
an observed rise in the average global surface temperature of 1
degree Fahrenheit over the last century. A warmer atmosphere
stimulates more precipitation, for instance. Whether the warming is
also modifying the El Nino-La Nina cycle in some way is an open
question.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was only a year ago that the most recent edition of El Nino,
one of the two most powerful on record, altered and strengthened
storm tracks flowing from the Pacific into North America. As a
result, storm after storm slammed into California and skimmed
across the southern tier of the country. Mudslides plagued the West
Coast, while killer tornadoes ravaged Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the rest of the country basked in unusual warmth. And
on the other side of the world, droughts and forest fires plagued
Indonesia and other parts of normally wet Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But in May, the extra-warm Pacific waters that define El Nino
began to lose much of their heat, and by autumn those waters had
become abnormally cool, ushering in La Nina. Now sea-surface
temperatures along the Equator are 2 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit below
normal, marking the existence of what the Federal scientists call
``mature La Nina conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Those conditions are expected to persist until May or June, then
begin to decay. What will happen after that is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   La Nina's effects on the atmosphere now, as it impinges on North
America, seem clear. Its main impact has been to alter the path of
the jet stream, the high-altitude river of air that runs from west
to east and marks the boundary between cold air masses from the
north and warm ones from the tropics. It is along this boundary,
where warm and cold air clash, that most winter storms develop.
</P>
<P>
   La Nina's main signature in North America is an exaggerated
pattern of jet stream flow in which the jet, leaving the North
Pacific region, frequently curves northward around a vast
high-pressure system near Alaska, then plunges down into Montana
and the Northern Plains and then into the central part of the
country before curving northeastward again. On the northern and
western sides of the downward bulge is cold winter air from Canada;
on the southern and eastern sides, warm tropical air from the
South. These circulation patterns typically span the entire
country. The weather any locality gets depends on where it is
situated in relation to them.
</P>
<P>
   The clash of the two big air masses is what led to this month's
tornadoes _ more than 100 so far, almost double the previous record
for January, 52. Thirty-one twisters touched down in Tennessee,
Arkansas and Mississippi on Jan. 17, followed by an outbreak of 55
more across the South on Jan. 21 and 22.
</P>
<P>
   In a normal winter, a southward bulge of cold air would enter
the United States farther east, in the Great Lakes region or the
Northeast, or both. This year, under La Nina's influence, the
bulges have materialized farther west, and then the masses of cold
air behind them have drifted slowly to the east.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever the cold air has gone this winter, it has brought harsh
conditions. Chicago broke a single-day snowfall record for the city
with 18.6 inches of snow Jan. 2. Buffalo, which styles itself the
nation's snow capital, received a record five feet of snow in two
weeks earlier this month. Indiana set an all-time low-temperature
record of minus 36 degrees Fahrenheit. Three feet of snow fell on
South Bend.
</P>
<P>
   In the east, between the periodic arrivals of cold air drifting
in from the west, the weather has often stayed unseasonably warm _
as in New York's ``January thaw.'' From time to time, the country
as a whole warmed up as the Alaskan high-pressure system broke
down. The jet stream, no longer having to surge far to the north as
it climbed over the high, resumed a more or less straight
west-to-east course, wafting warm Pacific air clear across the
continent.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Alaskan high would build up again, and the exaggerated
southward bulge of cold air would come once more.
</P>
<P>
   The other major effects of La Nina, Bell said, have been mostly
in the tropics. For instance, there have been good rains in
Indonesia, just the opposite of El Nino's drought last year. But La
Nina, he said, has also ``completely shut down'' rainfall in the
eastern tropical Pacific.

 E-Tailing's Rising Stars  &HT;       
 By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Neither Matt Glickman nor Mark Selcow had a child when they came up
with the idea three years ago of launching an online company
focused exclusively on new and expectant parents.
</P>
<P>
   But Glickman and his wife were thinking about having a baby and
Selcow was familiar with the women's health market from his job at
a bio-medical company.
</P>
<P>
   The two decided to meld editorial content and commerce and
provide comprehensive information on preconception, pregnancy and
babies as well as health education and a full line of products.
</P>
<P>
   Their San Francisco company, BabyCenter Inc., has its sights set
on becoming the Amazon.com in its field _ dispensing information
about babydom and selling thousands of products from maternity
clothes to bibs and cribs over the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The two are riding the boom in e-tailing, as it's called. And
Glickman, who now has a 10-month-old daughter, and Selcow seem to
have done a good job of corporate parenting so far.
</P>
<P>
   Both 33-year-olds have MBAs from Stanford. Both earned valuable
experience and made useful contacts in the real business world.
Glickman worked in marketing at Intuit, maker of Quicken financial
software, while Selcow worked for Amgen.
</P>
<P>
   With their experience and contacts they were able to get in many
doors. ``But we still had to sell our vision,'' Glickman said. ``We
got about 99 `no's' for every `yes'.''
</P>
<P>
   BabyCenter's start was a bit premature. Three years ago,
e-commerce was hardly a buzzword. But the two founders pressed
their point and rattled off favorable market data to support their
budding business.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. baby market is an $18 billion annual business, wedged
neatly between toys at $22 billion and CDs at $13 billion. In
addition, new parents are hungry for information and spend an
average of $7,100 in their baby's first year.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman and Selcow successfully won $13.5 million in startup
capital from respected venture capital investors including Bessemer
Venture Partners, Intel Corp. and Trinity Ventures. Sales and
advertising revenues are mushrooming. Its Web site
( &LR; www.babycenter.com &LR; ) has won the industry's ``Webby Award,'' and
it gets 10 million page views a month.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of ECOMMERC () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  On Monday, BabyCenter was one of more than a dozen companies
featured at Bessemer Venture Partner's e-Commerce CEO summit in
Menlo Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``We began investing in the consumer segment early because we
felt the major retail segments like baby products, furniture and
vitamins would start getting filled by the end of 1998,'' said
Bessemer general partner David Cowan.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of that market segment and the rise in e-tailing have
made for a strong combination. At Bessemer's conference, Ernst &AMP;
Young released its second annual Internet shopping study that shows
the number of retailers selling on the Web jumped to 39 percent
from 12 percent in the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers are getting more enthusiastic, too. More than half (51
percent) of online shoppers purchased at least five times over the
Internet last year, compared to only 17 percent the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Suisse First Boston Director Lise Buyer noted that online
shopping this past holiday season jumped 230 percent to $8 billion
from $3.5 billion in 1997 and the number of online shoppers has
quadrupled in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the hype about its potential, however, online
retailing still represents only about 1 percent of retail revenues.
Ernst &AMP; Young notes that nearly two-thirds of consumers don't shop
online for fear of sending credit card information over the Net and
difficulty navigating around a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it projects online sales will grow to 9 percent of retail
sales by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   To win venture capital and ultimately become a stock market
success, Buyer of CS First Boston said it is essential to have not
just ``an online solution, but a better solution.''
</P>
<P>
   She also observed that online traffic is ``a means to an end,
not the end; you can't pay employees with page views.'' And though
``it may be important to be first, it is even more important to be
best.'' For example, Yahoo, the leading search-engine company, was
the third to go public.
</P>
<P>
   Besides e-tailing companies that target large consumer markets
like BabyCenter, eToys, Furniture.com and health supplement vendor
MotherNature.com, Bessemer is investing heavily in Internet
infrastructure companies and the business-to-business market.
</P>
<P>
   Hambrecht &AMP; Quist Internet analyst Danny Rimer believes this
so-called B2B market could outstrip the consumer market and be
worth $300 billion within three years.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of ECOMMERC () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Within a decade, Bessemer principal Ravi Mhatre believes B2B will
be a trillion dollar market and suggested if ``The Graduate'' were
filmed today, Dustin Hoffman would be advised to get into B2B
instead of plastics.
</P>
<P>
   Entrepreneurial business-to-business startups featured at
Bessemer's e-commerce summit included:
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Collabria Inc.  &LR; The Menlo Park company, which just merged with
the Corporate Stores of San Jose, provides an online solution for
automating the purchase and production of printed materials such as
business cards, data sheets and brochures. A recent survey by the
National Association of Purchasing Managers pegs commercial
printing as the biggest opportunity for e-commerce procurement
efficiencies after office supplies. Collabria's customers range
from 3Com to the University of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; National Transportation Exchange &LR; . The Chicago company has
formed an Internet site to match shippers and commercial carriers
and help fill half-empty trucks. NTE figures that trucks are
underutilized as much as half the time and the Internet could help
eliminate as much as $31 billion a year in industry inefficiency.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; SciQuest &LR; . The Research Triangle Park, N.C., company is the
leading Internet source for laboratory and scientific products from
test tubes to rubber gloves. It connects 3,500 manufacturers with
25,000 pharmaceutical, biotechnology, university and industrial
buyers and aims to grab a chunk of the $9.4 billion annual market
for scientific products.
</P>
<P>
   The third piece of the e-commerce pie, as seen by Bessemer
Venture Partners, includes ``infrastructure'' companies that help
the Internet run better and companies that use it to gain a
competitive edge. Bay Area startups in this category include:
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Tumbleweed Software &LR; . The Redwood City company has raised
$11.6 million in venture capital since 1996 to become the leading
provider of online document delivery. Its flagship product, Posta,
combines the reliability and control of overnight delivery services
with the speed and simplicity of e-mail. The company has signed
several distribution partners including United Parcel Service,
Pitney Bowes and the U.S. Postal Service to send certified
electronic mail across the Internet.
</P>
<P>

 &LR;  _ &UR; Keynote Systems &LR; . The latest brainchild of serial entrepreneur
Umang Gupta, this San Mateo company has raised $8.5 million since
1995 and is the leading supplier of Internet measurement,
diagnostic and consulting services to companies that operate
e-commerce Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   With 70 computers around the world to measure Web traffic,
Keynote lets customers such as Amazon.com, Cisco systems and Wells
Fargo assess how quickly their customers get access to their sites
and how long it takes them to complete transactions versus their
competition. Gupta said Keynote plans to be ``the Internet

 Compaq Plans To Spin Off AltaVista  &HT;       
 By David Einstein 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Hoping to create a new Internet portal power and make a bunch of
money for its shareholders in the bargain, Compaq Computer said
yesterday that it is spinning off AltaVista as a stand-alone
company.
</P>
<P>
   The new AltaVista Co. will be based in Palo Alto, with a
development office in San Mateo. It is expected eventually to
employ up to 400 workers in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes one year to the day after Compaq
announced its acquisition of Massachusetts-based Digital Equipment
Corp., which developed the AltaVista search engine.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the acquisition, AltaVista was not viewed as one
of the linchpins of the deal, which brought Compaq Digital's
extensive service organization and its large-scale computer
business.
</P>
<P>
   AltaVista was a money-losing operation quickly falling behind
other search engines such as Yahoo and Excite, which were busily
turning their Web sites into Web portals featuring news,
entertainment, shopping and free e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   For the past year, however, stock prices of portals have soared,
creating companies worth billions of dollars. Compaq decided that
it could take advantage of the exploding market by turning
AltaVista into a portal and positioning it for an initial public
offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clearly our intent to take it public,'' Compaq chief
executive Eckhard Pfeiffer told a news conference yesterday. He
said the spin-off ``will unlock AltaVista's tremendous value for
company shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he gave no timetable, Compaq officials say an IPO could
come sometime this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compaq looked out and saw what the market was bidding for
these kinds of assets, and they figured they'd be idiots not to put
it out and let the market have a field day with this puppy,'' said
analyst Rob Enderle of Giga Information Group.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq already has begun its campaign to beef up AltaVista and
make it competitive with other portals. Recently, it acquired
Shopping.com, the popular online shopping site.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, in conjunction with the spin-off, Compaq announced an
agreement with Microsoft in which AltaVista users will be offered a
version of Microsoft's Hotmail, a leading free Internet mail
service. They also will get instant messaging that Microsoft is
developing.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, Microsoft agreed to use AltaVista as the
search engine on its own online service, the Microsoft Network.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say AltaVista, which trails other portals in usage
among Web surfers, has a long way to go to catch leaders Yahoo,
Excite, America Online and Netscape. But it does have a key
advantage the others lack: Compaq, the world's No.1 PC-maker,
installs a direct link to AltaVista on every home computer it
sells. Pfeiffer said those links have accounted for some 20 million
visits to AltaVista a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives them a resource the others don't have'' and could
vault it into the top ranks in short order, Enderle said.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq will invest heavily in adding content to AltaVista,
according to Rod Schrock, the general manager of Compaq's Consumer
Products Group, who will head up the new unit. ``We're going to
aggressively pick up the pace,'' he said, adding that AltaVista
soon will add entertainment and other information components to its
site.
</P>
<P>
   Schrock conceded that AltaVista probably will not be profitable
for at least two years.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq could have built a portal site without spinning it off,
he said, but decided that AltaVista would do better if it had its
own brand identity and access to the vast capital that comes with
going public.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, ``This is enough of a different business
model from Compaq's that we wanted to give it a clarity of focus.''

 Apple Will Settle Case Of Tech Help  &HT;       
 By Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Apple Computer has agreed to settle federal charges that it billed
thousands of consumers for technical support it advertised as free,
the Federal Trade Commission said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Apple will reimburse customers _ who were
charged $35 each time they called the firm for help beginning in
October 1997 _ and reinstate free, lifetime assistance for selected
computers and hardware peripherals sold from 1992 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC didn't specify how much the move will cost Apple, which
had promised free support as part of the Apple Assurance program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get a lot of complaints from individual users about
different brands,'' said Matthew Gold, the FTC lawyer in San
Francisco who worked on the case. ``When there is a pattern, like
we had with Apple, we investigate. They reneged on a promise to a
large number of consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   About 100 Apple hardware products _ including older Power Mac
desktop and PowerBook laptop models, defunct Performa and Quadra
computers, printers, scanners and digital cameras _ are covered by
the program. A complete list is available at
 &LR; www.ftc.gov/os/1999/9901/appendixa.htm &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   In its complaint, the FTC said Apple offered the free service
for products sold from September 1992 to April 1996 but in October
1997 began charging consumers a $35 fee for access to technical
support. In some cases, consumers were charged repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   But while millions of Apple-branded products were sold during
the four-year period, only consumers who called Apple's technical
help line and were charged $35 are eligible for a refund.
</P>
<P>
   ``For prospective purchasers of computer products, free access
to live technical support is especially enticing,'' Jodie
Bernstein, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection,
said in a statement. ``Companies that make such offers have to live
up to their promises.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple told the FTC that it will send a refund check or credit a
customer's bank account for any amount paid for technical support
under the Apple Assurance program. The Cupertino company is
expected to begin payments when the agency's order goes into effect
in 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   Apple had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement is the FTC's second with Apple in three years.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1997, the FTC charged that Apple misled consumers when
it advertised that all top-of-the-line Macintosh models could be
easily and immediately upgraded to the new PowerPC desktop system.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of APPLE27 (55552 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Although the claim was true for many Macs, it didn't apply to
certain Performa models and the Mac LC. Their upgrades were not
available for a year. Apple agreed to offer discounted updates to
owners of the affected machines.
</P>
<P>
   Apple currently offers a limited, one-year warranty and 90 days
of free telephone support for most of its products purchased after
1997. Defective hardware can be returned for repairs to thousands
of Apple Authorized Service Providers nationwide, including
CompUSA, ComputerWare, Best Buy and other computer stores. The
company offers extensive technical support online at
 &LR; www.apple.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   After three months, telephone support costs $35 per incident.
Customers have the option of buying phone-support packets of three
calls for $69, or 15 for $340.
</P>
<P>
   Apple suggests that consumers call (800) SOS-APPL (767-2775) for
more information.

SHARES ARE UP ON THE STRENGTH OF BLUE-CHIP COMPANIES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings reports
and stock-split announcements by a number of blue-chip companies
helped push stock prices higher Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   All major market gauges registered gains, with the Nasdaq
composite index rising to another record. The Nasdaq, far and away
the best performing index in January, jumped 64.10 points, or 2.71
percent on Tuesday, to 2,433.41, propelled by big gains in stocks
like Microsoft, Intel, Yahoo and Cisco Systems. The index is up
just under 11 percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average gained 121.26, or 1.32 percent,
to 9,324.58. Announcements that IBM, McDonald's and Xerox are
splitting their stocks helped propel the blue-chip index.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index gained 18.33, or 1.5
percent, to 1,252.31. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies
gained 3.22 points, or eight-tenths of a percent, to 425.33.
</P>
<P>
   And Thestreet.com's index of 20 Internet companies rose 23.51,
or 4.7 percent, to 520.10.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said the rise in Internet shares was caused by
expectations that America Online will easily beat earnings
estimates when it releases its quarterly report Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, a component of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500, rose
9, to 155 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite the big gains in the averages, winners only
narrowly outnumbered stocks that fell in price. Traders and
analysts said this was an indication the market remained
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil, which is the biggest problem, is quiet right now,''
said one trader, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``When
and if the next shoe drops down there, this market is going to go
right back down again. But for the moment everything is kind of
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices surged in Brazil on Tuesday, with the country's
Bovespa index gaining 6.33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Richard McCabe, chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.,
said he was not encouraged by Tuesday's market action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that just over 100 issues closed higher than those
that closed lower on the New York Stock Exchange is a pretty
miserable performance when the Dow is up this much,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are building a top on this post-October rally and
that we are in for a decline during the next few months that by
spring will bring the averages close to the lows they hit last
fall. That might complete a rotational, step-by-step bear market
that has been in effect for more than a year. About the only thing
it hasn't hit so far are the technology stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology shares, which slumped a bit last week, were stalwarts
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   IBM gained 3|, to 185|, after it said it would split its stock 2
for 1. Microsoft, which announced a 2 for 1 stock split on Monday,
rocketed 9 11/16, to 171 9/16. And Lucent Technologies, which had
been pounded recently on worries about slowing demand for its
products, gained 7 15/16, to 110.
</P>
<P>
   Among Internet companies, Yahoo jumped 39 1/4 to 351 1/4, and
Mindspring Enterprises, an Internet access provider, rose 14 5/16,
to 102 7/8.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies announcing stock splits included Xerox and
McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox, the copier company, gained 10 15/16 to 116 5/16 after its
fourth-quarter earnings report beat expectations and it said it
would split its stock 2 for 1.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth-quarter profits at McDonald's rose 8.8 percent from
year-earlier levels. The company also announced a 2 for 1 stock
split. McDonald's shares rose 3 1/6, to 78 15/16.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Drug stocks, which have been lower of late, recovered some
ground Tuesday on the strength of positive earnings reports.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson gained 3}, to 82{, after reporting that
fourth- quarter profits before charges rose 10 percent. Merck
gained 6 1/2, to 144, after it said fourth-quarter net income rose
13 percent on sales of five new drugs. And Schering-Plough, maker
of the allergy drug Claritin, rose 11/16, to 52 5/8, after it
reported a 22 percent gain in fourth-quarter profits.
</P>
<P>
   Warner-Lambert did not release its earnings Tuesday, but its
stock gained 1 5/8, to 69[, after it said it will buy Agouron
Pharmaceuticals for $2.1 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Trading in Agouron, manufacturer of the best-selling protease
inhibitor to treat AIDs, was halted before the announcement. The
stock last traded at 56 13/16, up 3 21/32 from Monday's close.

IN ST. LOUIS, POPE AGAIN EXTENDS HAND TO JEWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ When Pope John Paul II presides at a prayer service
at this city's Roman Catholic cathedral on Wednesday afternoon, a
local rabbi will read from Scripture and a Polish-born Jew who fled
her homeland during the Nazi invasion will be among the guests.
</P>
<P>
   Before the pope celebrates Mass at a domed stadium earlier in
the day, a synagogue's choir director has been invited to call
people to worship by blowing the shofar, the ram's horn
traditionally used during services at the Jewish High Holy Days.
</P>
<P>
   What may be most notable about such features of the pope's brief
visit here is that they are not terribly remarkable for a papal
visit these days, a sign of how far Roman Catholic-Jewish relations
have advanced during John Paul's 21-year pontificate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tangible sign, in the heart of America, that this pope
reaches out, especially to Jews, wherever he goes,'' said Rabbi
James Rudin, interreligious affairs director of the American Jewish
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The events will come on the second and final day of the pope's
visit to St. Louis, a stop he is making after five days in Mexico
City on his 85th pastoral trip. The visit here _ the fifth time he
has set foot as pontiff on U.S. soil _ is widely seen as a gesture
of his regard for Archbishop Justin Rigali of St. Louis. Rigali
served at the Vatican for nearly 30 years before the pope appointed
him to his current position.
</P>
<P>
   In the church's relations with Jews, the pope has built on the
spirit of reforms adopted 34 years ago during the Second Vatican
Council, specifically the document ``Nostra Aetate,'' which, among
much else, condemned anti-Semitism and called for ``brotherly
dialogue'' between Catholics and Jews on biblical and theological
issues.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul II has made symbolic and substantive moves to improve
relations between the two faiths, visiting Rome's historic
synagogue, holding a concert memorializing the Holocaust's victims
and establishing diplomatic relations between the Vatican and
Israel. As a Pole who lived through the Nazi occupation of his
homeland, he has also offered personal reflections on Jewish
suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the issue of the Holocaust has remained a complicating
factor in the church's relations with Jews. When the Vatican issued
a long-awaited statement on the Holocaust last year, Jewish leaders
had a mixed response, some praising its overall tone, some voicing
disappointment that it stopped short of a greater discussion of
historic Christian anti-Semitism and that it defended Pope Pius
XII, the wartime pontiff who has been faulted for not having spoken
out publicly against the Nazi attack on Europe's Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Consideration of the Holocaust, said Abraham Foxman, national
director of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, ``is still
an unfinished chapter in the relationship'' between the church and
Jews. But Foxman called the pope ``courageous'' in working to
improve Catholic-Jewish relations. In that spirit, the league's St.
Louis chapter placed an advertisement in the Catholic newspaper
here, welcoming the pope.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Among 95 non-Catholics invited to the service on Wednesday is
Anna Gruber, a Polish native who fled the Nazis and who moved to
the United States after the war. She recalled in an interview that
she was stirred by the pope's visit to the Rome synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I read that a few years ago,'' Ms. Gruber said, ``I said,
`You are a blessing, you are a blessing not just for Christianity
but for all mankind.'''
</P>
<P>
   At the service, Rabbi Robert Jacobs, executive vice president of
the St. Louis Rabbinical Association, will read a passage from the
biblical book of Isaiah (35:1-6).
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs, 90, said he was initially astonished by the invitation,
which he received from the archdiocese two weeks ago, but was
pleased to accept. The pope, he said, ``has gone to every big city
and asked for a special audience with local Jewish leaders. He has
done that for 20 years. He has sought out the Jews.''

 &HT;    At Bowl, they're paying the Shell game
 &HT;    By Dave George
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The subject isn't always football at the Super Bowl.
Tuesday a group of reporters gathered a Pro Football Hall of Famer
in the baseball dugout at Pro Player Stadium to discuss the rules
of a different game altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The Shell game.
</P>
<P>
   It's a con, pure and simple, by the customary definition. Take a
pebble or some other small object and conceal it with such
dexterity and deception that the poor sap who believes he has found
the one shell out of three that actually covers the prize will lose
his bet again and again. Quite literally, he keeps coming up empty.
</P>
<P>
   And so it is with Art Shell, trusted assistant on the Atlanta
Falcons' Super Bowl staff. Not the poor sap part, of course. A
dominating offensive tackle during his playing days, this 260-pound
mountain of power and patience understands exactly what is
happening to him and so many other black assistant coaches around
the NFL. Team owners consistently find reasons to pass over them
when it comes to naming a head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Qualified professionals, in other words, keep coming up empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to find excuses,'' said Shell, ``you can find an
excuse for any situation. Some teams have been saying lately that
they wanted to go with a coach who had experience calling plays.
Well, I didn't call plays before I became a head coach with the
Raiders. I was an offensive line coach.''
</P>
<P>
   And so he is today, getting top production from a Falcons' line
that features rookie Ephraim Salaam.
</P>
<P>
   At San Diego State, Salaam also was a 6-foot-7 basketball
center, nicknamed the ``Shaq of the WAC'' for his piledriver post
moves. Under Shell's guidance, the kid became an immediate force in
Atlanta, the first Falcons rookie since 1993 to start every game.
Tuesday he answered many questions about paving the way for Jamal
Anderson's 1,846-yard rushing season but paused often to speak of
someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even say how tremendous Art Shell is,'' Salaam said.
``He's truly a great coach in terms of football but he's also a
great coach in terms of if you ever need someone to talk to about
anything on or off the field.''
</P>
<P>
   On the field, the only thing that must be said about Shell is
54-38. That was his record as head coach of the Los Angeles Raiders
from 1989-94. And that career winning percentage, almost 59
percent, is better than Jimmy Johnson's.
</P>
<P>
   Off the field, he'll speak for himself, and against anything as
nonsensical as a league that is 70 percent black but has only three
black head coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't regret the guys who were hired,'' Shell said of a half
dozen former coordinators named to lead NFL teams since the regular
season's end despite a lack of head coaching experience. ``They're
all good coaches. I just believe there should be more opportunities
for qualified guys like Sherm Lewis and Emmitt Thomas. Just to go
and talk with a team is not enough. If a guy is going to talk, OK,
let's really talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Rhodes, the only black coach among the recent hires, has
guaranteed a place for Lewis and Thomas in Green Bay as his
offensive and defensive coordinators. He also has promised Lewis
the authority to call the Packers' plays, something he didn't have
under Mike Holmgren. A definite improvement, but still it must feel
like a consolation prize to Lewis after interviewing at Chicago.
The Bears thoroughly bumbled that process, announcing Arizona
assistant Dave McGinnis as their head coach before they had an
agreement and then turning to Jacksonville assistant Dick Jauron as
a fall-back choice.
</P>
<P>
   Shell, meanwhile, was penalized for being part of a successful
program in Atlanta. NFL tampering rules prohibit teams from talking
to job candidates until all games have been played by the
prospect's current employer. In Shell's case, the Falcons going all
the way to the Super Bowl removed him from consideration by panicky
owners who couldn't wait to settle their houses and head to the
golf course.
</P>
<P>
   The one exception was Cleveland, a reborn franchise granted a
special exemption to talk to anyone, anytime. Shell interviewed
there but Jacksonville offensive coordinator Chris Palmer,
considered a longshot at the beginning of the process, got the
Browns' job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a very strong urge to be a head coach,'' Shell said.
``I've never lost that urge. I understood what it would take for us
to have a chance to win with the Raiders but I didn't get the
chance to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   If Al Davis weren't such a notorious contrarian, there would
have been no opportunity at all. When Shell took over the Raiders,
he was the first black head coach in professional football since
1925. It shouldn't be this difficult, especially when owners
regularly fire coaches on a whim and then fill their positions with
such mindless haste.
</P>
<P>
   After all, when Shell was handed the Raiders four games into the
1989 season, it was because Davis had pulled the rug out from under
a kid coach who supposedly couldn't cut it.
</P>
<P>
   Some guy named Mike Shanahan.

 &HT;    Eight Chambers of Commerce announce joint legislative goals
 &HT;    36th Texas Legistlature
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ In an unprecedented joint appeal, Texas's eight largest
chambers of commerce are asking the Legislature to spend more money
on education, job training and transportation and create new tax
credits to add fuel to the state's economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Metro Eight,'' an ad hoc group that includes the chambers
of Austin, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, Fort Worth, El Paso,
Arlington and Corpus Christi, unveiled its five-point proposal on
Tuesday at a Capitol news conference. The chambers have coordinated
their lobbying efforts before, but this is the first time they've
hammered out a common legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a synergy that comes form all of the organizations
working together, and obviously a much stronger voice before the
Legislature,'' said Glenn West, president of the Greater Austin
Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Work-force development is the business community's top concern,
West said, and three of the five proposals address education and
training issues. The chambers want lawmakers to raise salaries for
teachers from kindergarten through 12th grade, spend more money on
reading initiatives and pre-school programs, and funnel additional
dollars to fast-growing urban school districts. At the same time,
without offering specifics, they ask the Legislature to
``strengthen the financial accountability of school districts.''
</P>
<P>
   In the area of higher education, the Metro Eight proposal calls
for more money for two- and four-year colleges and universities,
and more scholarship help for middle-income families. It also calls
for increased state support of ``high-priority'' technical and
vocational programs.
</P>
<P>
   The group wants state lawmakers to substantially expand two of
the state's job training programs, the Skills Development Fund and
the Smart Jobs Program. The proposal advocates between $50 million
and $100 million a year for the Skills Development Fund, up from
the current $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Metro Eight is also urging the Legislature to pour more
money into transportation, and to make sure that gasoline tax
revenue is used only for building and maintaining highways.
</P>
<P>
   ``While public safety and security should continue to be
adequately funded, it is critical for the Legislature to address
our state's transportation-funding needs by refocusing the
dedicated gasoline tax funds for construction and maintenance of
our highways,'' the proposal states.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the group is asking lawmakers to create tax credits for
research and development and major capital investments. Leaders of
the chambers said many businesses decline to move to or expand in
Texas because the state's tax code penalizes those activities.

 By ERIC SCHMITT   and LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Democrats warned on Tuesday that calling
witnesses in President Clinton's impeachment trial would prolong
the proceedings, but Republicans countered with a plan to appease
skittish moderates that would limit the time for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   The off-the-floor skirmishing, which spilled onto the Senate
floor in closed debate Tuesday night, came after House Republican
prosecutors strengthened their case for witnesses by paring their
proposed list to three people who would, at this point, give
depositions that would be closed to the public: Monica Lewinsky,
Vernon Jordan and Sidney Blumenthal. The prosecutors have also
asked the Senate to invite Clinton to give a deposition.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday senators are likely to adhere to party lines and
vote against dismissing the two impeachment articles. But a second
vote, on whether to depose the three potential witnesses, is too
close to call, senators said, although both sides said the momentum
was moving toward passage.
</P>
<P>
   One senior Republican senator, Ted Stevens of Alaska, said that
the motion to question witnesses could win 53-59 votes.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, Republicans cobbled together a proposal
governing how witnesses would be handled, hoping it would satisfy
undecided senators in both parties. At a Republican caucus Tuesday
morning, Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island offered a plan to limit
the questioning of each witness to three hours by the prosecutors
and three hours by the White House and to videotape the witnesses
so senators not at the interviews could gauge their demeanor and
credibility. Some senators suggested that excerpts from the
videotapes could be used in place of live witnesses before the
Senate itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very rational, a very modest proposal,'' said Sen.
Mike DeWine, R-Ohio. ``It is important for many of us who took the
oath, who are still weighing the evidence, who really want to see
these key witnesses testify, to have the opportunity to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, supports
the plan, which could become the centerpiece of a resolution that
guides the Senate through the deposition phase of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate could vote on the plan as early as Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing that they were losing the battle over witnesses,
Democrats immediately took the microphones to play on Republican
fears of a protracted and unseemly spectacle. Democrats cautioned
that by opening the door to witnesses, Republicans would also have
to allow White House lawyers to peruse the 54,000 pages of House
documents they have not seen, as well as documents held by the
independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, a process they said could take
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our colleagues need to clearly understand that if it's a
choice between expeditious and fair, Democrats are going to fall on
the side of fairness,'' said Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the
Democratic leader.
</P>
<P>
   The White House would also have the right to call witnesses,
which presidential aides said would entail lengthy preparations.
``This motion for witnesses is a motion to delay,'' said a White
House spokesman, James Kennedy. ``It makes delay a certainty. There
is no doubt about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans immediately accused Democrats of employing
scare tactics to derail what they said was a legitimate part of any
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that White House has made a threat,'' said Sen.
Jon Kyl, a Republican from Arizona. ``It is not an appropriate way
to influence the Senate in deciding whether to grant the House
managers' motion.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering the third week of the trial, the Senate seems close to
following the same partisan script that engulfed the House's
contentious impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Lott and Daschle have consulted each other regularly through the
trial and brokered an unusual unanimous agreement that has steered
the Senate proceedings up to now.
</P>
<P>
   But aides to Daschle said he had not been told of Chafee's plan,
and several Republican senators said they would use their majority
to muscle the framework for questioning witnesses, if need be.
Daschle, however, has rebuffed several Republican invitations to
talk about witnesses, saying that should wait until after the vote
on depositions.
</P>
<P>
   As Senate Republicans and Democrats jockeyed over the witness
question in corridors, private hideaways and, by Tuesday night, on
the Senate floor itself, Lott was promoting a strategy to end the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Under that approach, the Senate would vote to find that Clinton
had committed the offenses charged in the two articles of
impeachment: perjury and obstruction of justice. After that,
senators would take a second vote on whether to remove him from
office.
</P>
<P>
   It was difficult to judge what chances such a plan would have of
being accepted by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The catalyst for Tuesday's off-the-floor maneuvering was the
House prosecutors' decision, under pressure from Senate
Republicans, to trim their witness list to three people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't what we would like, but we have to be realistic,''
Rep. Henry Hyde, the lead prosecutor, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were virtually united in opposing witnesses. ``They're
just reiterating what they've said from Day 1,'' said Barbara Boxer
of California.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, for the most part, praised the prosecutors. But
Sen. Susan Collins of Maine expressed dismay that they did not put
Betty Currie, the president's secretary, on the list. ``I'm really
surprised and disappointed,'' Collins said. ``She's central to the
obstruction-of-justice charges, and it's going to be harder to
resolve that without her.''
</P>
<P>
   A House Republican aide said the House managers decided that
Mrs. Currie probably would not clear up the question of whether
Clinton was trying to coach her about Ms. Lewinsky's visits to the
White House and would not resolve whether the president directed
her to retrieve gifts he gave Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the House prosecutors asked the Senate to consider,
but not vote on, whether to invite Clinton to submit to
questioning. Sen. Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, said that
senators would welcome the president's testimony but should not
compel it, a common view among most senators.
</P>
<P>
   Lott has not decided whether to request that Clinton testify, a
senior Republican aide said.

 WASHINGTON: R-Fla., said.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   But Lott's efforts seemed to have turned the tide on witnesses.
On Monday night, many Republicans were saying the Senate could very
well decide on Wednesday to block witnesses, with six or more
Republicans voting with the Democrats. On Tuesday, by contrast,
they seemed much more certain that witnesses will be approved when
the crucial vote arrives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow we will vote in favor of deposing witnesses,'' Sen.
Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said confidently. ``And in doing so we will
reinforce the ancient precedents of constitutional impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   So the vote will satisfy those Republicans who believe it would
set a dangerous constitutional precedent to cut off the impeachment
trial. It keeps the party's conservative base from charging that
the Senate just dismissed the case against the president. And, if
things go according to plan, the trial will end by mid-February.
</P>
<P>
   But there are political risks for Republicans as well. Even
though they are reining in their House counterparts, Senate
Republicans will still be voting to prolong a trial that most
Americans want to see end. According to a poll taken by the Gallup
organization for CNN and USA Today last weekend, two-thirds of
Americans believed the Senate should go directly to a final vote on
impeachment without hearing from witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   And Wednesday's votes will once again mark the Republicans as
the party of impeachment, for it is expected to bring what
Republicans had once hoped to avoid: near party-line votes, as the
Republicans first defeat a Demoratic effort to outright dismiss the
case against the president and then most likely approve, with
little Democratic help, witness depositions.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are also wagering that once they allow
depositions, they will still be able to end the trial quickly. But
that may not necessarily be the case. Under the bipartisan trial
plan approved in early January, the majority leader and minority
leader are supposed jointly to set the ground-rules for
depositions.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Tom Daschle, the minority leader, and the White House
warned in increasingly strident tones on Tuesday that once
depositions are allowed, the trial of the president will inevitably
spiral out of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our colleagues need to clearly understand that if it's a
choice between expeditious and fair,'' Daschle said, ``Democrats
are going to fall on the side of fairness.'' And David Kendall,
Clinton's private lawyer, warned the Senate of a long legal process
ahead ``if the genie of discovery is let out of the bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   There are several ways this trial could yet be extended. After
the depositions, the Senate can take individual votes on whether it
wants to allow prosecutors to call Monica Lewinsky or any other
witness to testify in the chamber. And after the House's three
witnesses are questioned, the White House has a chance to present
its own witness list for a Senate vote. Some Democrats have
threatened that the White House will call Kenneth Starr or Linda
Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are counting on the fact that the Democrats and
Clinton's lawyers are bluffing. One senior Republican leadership
official said on Tuesday that if the White House ever does submit
its own witness list, ``it will be rational.''

BUSH TO OUTLINE PLANS FOR SCHOOL FUNDING, TAX CUTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush is expected to outline his
plans for a $2 billion property tax cut and more money for public
schools in his state of the state address to the Legislature on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes declined Tuesday to discuss
details of the speech, which governors traditionally use to focus
Texans' attention on their programs. But she said he would address
his top priorities of a tax cut and school funding.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush was expected to hold firm to the $2 billion cut in
local school property taxes that he pledged during his re-election
campaign, the governor already has hinted that he may back off of
some other tax cut promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all going to have to adjust our sights,'' he said two
weeks ago, in the face of a smaller-than-anticipated budget
surplus, an increase in basic spending needs and a warning from key
legislative budget writers.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's staff was believed to be reducing some of the
$600 million in state sales and business tax cuts that Bush also
proposed during his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's remarks also may attract significant national interest
this year, given his role as an unannounced, but anticipated,
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Although the governor has said he hasn't even made up his mind
on a White House race, a television news crew from New Hampshire,
which holds the first presidential primary of the election year, is
among media organizations that asked for credentials to cover the
speech.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Bill Siebert, R-San Antonio, said the governor, who
met privately with the House Republican Caucus on Tuesday, gave
lawmakers a ``good pep talk'' on his ``two top priorities _
education and tax relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Siebert didn't recall any specific figures from Bush's
presentation but said he believed the governor was committed to
substantial tax reductions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Bush has proposed increasing state funding for
public schools by $1.6 billion _ on top of the $2 billion the state
would reimburse local school districts for the property tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   But the governor, in remarks to the Texas Farm Bureau later
Tuesday, cautioned against the Legislature being too eager to spend
money on other new programs.
</P>
<P>
   If lawmakers spend too much money now, he warned, ``You wake up
five or 10 years from now and say, `Oops, we need an income tax.'''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``My budget proposal is designed to make sure Texas
will never have a personal income tax. I'm dead set against a
personal income tax.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's other education priorities include a pilot
program that would allow some students in low-performing public
schools to use tax-paid vouchers to attend private schools and a
new plan for ending social promotion in Texas schools.

 &HT;    Costello to admit part in murder
 &HT;    By Pat Moore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   STUART, Fla. _ Lisa Costello will end more than 2 1/2 years of
silence today and admit her role in the 1996 murder and kidnapping
of New Jersey bus company owner Frank Black, according to a plea
agreement her attorney reached with prosecutors this week.
</P>
<P>
   A judge is scheduled to hear Costello's plea to reduced charges
that implicate her in the elaborate plot to murder her millionaire
boyfriend's business rival.
</P>
<P>
   The former Jupiter woman has agreed to testify against Alan
Mackerley as he appeals his convictions for kidnapping and
murdering Black at his Stuart waterfront home Feb. 24, 1996.
Mackerley was sentenced to life in prison after jurors found him
guilty of both charges last year.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the plea deal, Costello will admit Frank Black is
dead, that Mackerley killed him, but that she did not see Black
being killed, court records show.
</P>
<P>
   If retired Florida Supreme Court Chief Justice James Alderman
accepts the plea recommendations from prosecuting and defense
attorneys, Costello will be sentenced to 10 years in prison with
credit for the past 2 1/2 years she spent in the Martin County
Jail.
</P>
<P>
   She spent nearly two of those years jailed on a contempt charge
for refusing to tell investigators what she knew about Black's
disappearance. On the day the contempt charge expired,
investigators charged her with Black's murder and kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to hearing what she has to say _ that's
for certain _ but it's not over until it's over,'' said Florida
Department of Law Enforcement Agent Mike Driscoll. He and retired
FBI Agent Jay Miller are scheduled to interview Costello under oath
before today's court session at the Martin County Courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say Costello used a false name to lure Black to
Florida under the guise of conducting a business deal nearly three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   She picked him up at Palm Beach International Airport and used
one his credit cards seven hours after his arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Mackerley shot Black at his Stuart home, then dumped his body
from his speedboat into the ocean, authorities say. Black's body
was never found.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors will give Costello a choice of pleading to several
charges, but they will recommend a 10-year prison sentence and a
15-year probation term no matter what she decides.
</P>
<P>
   With credit for good behavior in prison, she could be out in
about five years, her attorney Richard Kibbey said.
</P>
<P>
   Black's daughters, Diane and Leeanna Black, said they did not
want to comment Tuesday on the proposed plea deal.

IRAQ STILL TRIES TO HIDE ARMS PROGRAMS, REPORT SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ President Saddam Hussein, who barred the return
of arms inspectors to Iraq after U.S.-British air strikes in
December, is still actively trying to conceal past and present
illegal weapons programs, the chief inspector told the Security
Council in a report this week.
</P>
<P>
   The report says that Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz is
among a handful of officials close to Saddam who devised and still
run the concealment effort. He is Saddam's chief liaison with the
outside world.
</P>
<P>
   The report, possibly the last to be submitted by the U.N.
Special Commission, known as Unscom, the body specially created to
disarm Iraq, says for the first time that credible information on
Iraqi concealment efforts continues to be supplied to the
inspectors by Iraqis outside the country and by others who have
dealt with Saddam over the years.
</P>
<P>
   It has created new tensions in the Security Council between the
United States and Russia, which wants to lift sanctions on Iraq.
Russia, which now refuses to recognize Unscom and is demanding the
dismissal of its executive chairman, Richard Butler, has
effectively suppressed the publication or distribution of the
262-page report, even within the U.N. system.
</P>
<P>
   Copies of it were made available by diplomats and officials
eager to see its conclusions made public before a debate on Iraq
resumes Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council is now facing a decision, largely forced by
Russia and France, over whether to declare the active disarmament
phase over in Iraq, a necessary step to lifting the oil embargo,
which was instituted after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The report, however, recommends that if intrusive inspections
are to end or be scaled back, any monitoring system that takes
their place will require a doubling of the inspection budget and
considerably enhanced access to hundreds of sites around Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report documents that Iraq has never really intended to
cooperate with the U.N. despite a history of agreements to do so,''
said Peter Burleigh, the U.S. representative on the council.
</P>
<P>
   He said in an interview that the report ``reflects the
consistent pattern of concealment as well as confirms that there
are many basic unanswered questions with regard to the disarmament
of Iraq in all weapons of mass destruction areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq insists that it has met all disarmament requirements and
poses no danger to its neighbors. The report attempts to catalog
exhaustively why inspectors do not accept that assurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to receive reports from Iraqis outside Iraq
diametrically opposed to what Iraq is telling us,'' said Charles
Duelfer, deputy executive chairman of the commission. ``Are we
supposed to ignore them?''
</P>
<P>
   Half a dozen proposals are now on the table for discussion when
debate resumes. A number of council members appear prepared to
strip the Special Commission of its autonomy and make it part of
the U.N. Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
   The comprehensive report is largely a summary of what is already
known about Iraqi programs, and as such serves as a handbook for
council members who argue that it would be dangerous to reward
Saddam for his defiance. It surveys at considerable length the area
of biological weapons and Iraq's potential ability to deploy or use
them. More concerns surround the biological program than any other.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the International Atomic Energy Agency, a U.N.
agency that has been monitoring Iraq for nuclear activity while the
commission watched biological, chemical and missile programs, has
waded into the debate with an unofficial report by the agency's
director, Mohamed Elbaradei, that criticized the commission as
being too insensitive and adversarial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Needless confrontation can only detract from the efficiency of
the verification process,'' the paper said. It described the best
kind of inspectors as ``international career civil servants who
have loyalty to the verification organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats see this as support by the IAEA for demands that
the Special Commission, a body of independent experts loaned by
national governments, be folded into the U.N. bureaucracy. The IAEA
has had disagreements with the special commission.
</P>
<P>
   David Albright, president of the independent Institute for
Science and International Security in Washington, said that while
there may a need for a shake-up of both the Special Commission and
the IAEA, which has its own independent ``action team'' working on
Iraq, ``you don't want a culture that would rather avoid
confrontation than face it head on'' when dealing with a leader
like Saddam.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   France's representative on the council, Alain Dejammet, who has
also called for lifting the oil embargo but retaining financial and
disarmament restrictions on Iraq, has told reporters in recent days
that a standoff in the Council helps no one but Saddam. No arms
inspections have taken place in Iraq since early December, and the
program will remain frozen until there is a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   In a section devoted to Iraq's concealment policies, the report
describes how Saddam and a few top aides, backed by the Special
Republican Guard and at least two intelligence services, devised a
policy to deflect inspectors. The Iraqis lied about the extent of
the weapons they possessed, then destroyed some of them secretly,
never providing the commission with credible accounts of their
activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was not recognized at the time,'' the report says, ``was
that the unilateral destruction action itself was a determined
measure taken to conceal evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the commission had to turn to forensic work and
considerable intelligence-gathering on its own. A deep distrust of
all Iraqi information soon developed. It was intensified in 1995
when Iraq was forced to admit to having programs it had earlier
denied after the defection of Lt. Gen. Hussein Kamal, the
president's son-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commission still does not know the precise meaning of
Iraq's failure to provide accurate data,'' the report concludes.
</P>
<P>
   The account of Iraq's biological weapons program, how the
commission came to know about it and what it still does not know,
is considered by the United States to be the most frightening and
damning warning against declaring an end to active arms
inspections, lifting the oil embargo and allowing cash to flow
directly to the Iraqi government.
</P>
<P>
   From 1991 to 1995 Iraq steadfastly declared that it had never
tried to make germ agents or conduct research on how to mount them
on missiles or aircraft. In 1995, the commission confronted Iraq
with evidence of huge imports of material on which to grow toxins,
much of it imported under the guise of ingredients for making
pesticides or other non-weapons goods, often in quantities larger
than those needed by industry or medical institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Baghdad subsequently admitted in July 1995 that it had made
anthrax and botulinum. In August 1995, the Iraqis further admitted
that they had tested weapons loaded with germ agents.
</P>
<P>
   It is now known that there was a biological weapons program as
early as 1973, and that aflatoxins were also among the germ agents
produced by Iraq. A complete tabular account of what is known and
not known now about the Iraqi germ warfare agents is included in
the report.
</P>
<P>
   Three times, Baghdad has presented the commission with ``full
final and complete disclosures,'' each different from the one
before, and none considered acceptable by international experts.
The last expert review was done in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq has recently pressed for the experts to make a `quality
assessment' as to whether any biological weapons or agents remain
in Iraq,'' the commission report says, and adds: ``To assess the
quality of any biological agent over time requires knowledge and
confidence in that knowledge. This includes the physical state of
the agent, e.g, liquid or dried, with or without stabilizers;
storage conditions of the filled weapons or bulk agent, e.g.,
temperature, humidity, containers etc.; tests done on the agent
before and after filling, and the results of such tests. None of
this information on Iraqi weapons is available to the commission.''

ABU NIDAL, MIDEAST TERRORIST, IS SAID TO BE BACK IN IRAQ  
 (FE) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Abu Nidal, one of the world's most infamous
terrorists, moved to Baghdad late last year and obtained the
protection of Iraq's president, Saddam Hussein, according to
intelligence reports received by U.S. and Middle Eastern government
officials. The reports have raised questions about whether Iraq is
pushing to establish a terrorism network, American and Middle
Eastern officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Nidal, a brutal survivor of the Middle East's terrorist wars
dating to the 1970s, had been living in Cairo for more than a year,
according to Middle Eastern government officials who say they have
information from inside his organization. While intelligence
information about terrorist groups is by nature difficult to obtain
and hard to corroborate, American intelligence officials say they
consider these Middle Eastern officials to be highly reliable about
terrorism in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Although Abu Nidal's organization is a shadow of the terrorist
machine that staged airport killings in the mid-1980s and other
raids on Arab, Jewish and other targets, since he moved to Egypt,
the Middle Eastern officials said, he has been directing attacks on
Islamic radicals who have been at war with the Egyptian government.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence officials said he has been hard-pressed
financially and has been seeking financial backing and a new
government sponsor since Col. Moammar Gadhafi of Libya, looking for
ways to persuade the United Nations to lift economic sanctions,
backed away from him in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Nidal's move to Iraq, which he was forced to leave 15 years
ago, suggests that he may have renewed a relationship with Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could become a more significant threat again if he finds
more effective state sponsorship,'' an American intelligence
official added.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Nidal still has 200 to 300 followers in his organization,
and they have been active in recent years, especially against Arab
targets. His group's recent actions included killing a radical
Egyptian cleric in Yemen in July, according to the Middle Eastern
government officials. Saddam lacks such hard-earned expertise at
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Officials caution that there is no evidence that Abu Nidal is
planning to conduct terrorism on Iraq's behalf. In recent years, he
has not attacked American targets and has become a lower priority
for American counterterrorism officials, who have focused instead
on Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile who officials say was the
mastermind behind the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania in August.
</P>
<P>
   But counterterrorism experts in the Middle East say Abu Nidal
remains a significant threat. One official who has watched Abu
Nidal for years said, ``Osama bin Laden is a student by
comparison.''
</P>
<P>
   About 10 days before the Dec. 16 start of American and British
attacks against Iraq, Abu Nidal traveled from Cairo to Baghdad
through Tehran, Middle Eastern officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian authorities have denied that he was recently in their
country. But other Middle Eastern officials said that Abu Nidal
arrived in Cairo from Libya in 1997 and that he was in Egypt with
the knowledge of the nation's internal security service. A coup
attempt within his organization eventually drew attention to his
presence in Egypt, posing a new problem for the Egyptian
government, the Middle Eastern officials said. Abu Nidal's move to
Baghdad ended embarrassing attention for Egypt, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Some American officials have acknowledged receiving reports that
Abu Nidal has moved to Baghdad. After concluding that the Central
Intelligence Agency and other intelligence services had blunted
Iraq's previous efforts to sponsor terrorism, officials in
Washington say that that could change with the arrival of Abu
Nidal.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Nidal was once America's most wanted terrorist. A 1989 State
Department report called his organization the most dangerous
terrorist group in the world, and a 1991 report calculated that it
had been responsible for more than 100 attacks and the deaths of
more than 280 people since 1974.
</P>
<P>
   A Palestinian renegade who broke with the Palestinian Liberation
Organization to undertake his own terrorist campaign, Abu Nidal,
now about 60, has had a long running war with both the Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and King Hussein of Jordan, accusing them of
being too willing to compromise with Israel. He has vowed to kill
both Arafat and Hussein, and the PLO sentenced him to death in
absentia in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   He and Saddam also have a tortured history, and their
relationship is not built on mutual trust. Iraq helped Abu Nidal
become an international terrorist in the early 1970s, but Abu Nidal
left Bagdhad in the early 1980s, in part because Saddam discovered
that he was also working with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was double dealing on Iraq,'' says one Middle Eastern
government's expert on Abu Nidal's operations.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has a history of conducting terrorist acts on behalf
of his hosts, Abu Nidal has also worn out his welcome because of
his bloody methods and his willingness to betray his sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Reports last year that he was in Cairo proved awkward for the
Clinton administration, since Egyptian support is vital to American
policies in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the United States has also expressed qualms about Egypt's
counterterrorism policies, especially the ruthless tactics used
against Egyptian radicals. The Central Intelligence Agency even
suspended a counterterrorism training program for a hostage rescue
unit.
</P>
<P>
   Washington did not press the Egyptians about Abu Nidal's
presence in the country. When the administration asked about Abu
Nidal last fall, the Egyptians denied that he was in the country,
and the United States did not publicly protest.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian officials continue to deny that Abu Nidal was in Cairo
or that Egyptian intelligence was complicit in any of his terrorist
activities. They note that Egypt was the victim of Abu Nidal in the
past and say their country would not deal with him. ``There is
absolutely no foundation for any of these allegations,'' said an
Egyptian embassy spokesman, Abdelaleem Elabyad. ``I was told to
deny them in the most affirmative way.''
</P>
<P>
   American intelligence officials declined to comment on the
allegations that Abu Nidal conducted terrorist acts while in Egypt
or that the Egyptians knew of his actions. At the State Department,
officials said they were unaware of the allegations.

RED SOX TALKING TO HAMELIN

<P>
   BOSTON _ This should not be interpreted as an open casting call
to find a replacement for Mo Vaughn, but the Red Sox have invited
former American League Rookie of the Year Bob Hamelin to big league
camp next month.
</P>
<P>
   Hamelin hit 24 home runs as a rookie for the Kansas City Royals
in 1994, which is 20 more than Vaughn hit his rookie season, 1991.
But while Vaughn went on to hit 40 last season, Hamelin has never
come close to matching his rookie output. His average dived to .168
in 1995, when he had more strikeouts (56) than hits (35), and he
has reached double figures in home runs only once since his
coming-out season, hitting 18 for the Tigers in '97.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, playing for Milwaukee, Hamelin hit .219, with just
7 home runs in 146 at-bats. Hamelin, a first baseman/DH, signed a
minor league deal with the Sox, with an invitation to big league
camp.
</P>
<P>
   A similar deal was extended to El Guapo, righthanded reliever
Rich Garces, whose Red Sox career has been revived just when it
appeared over; he was given his unconditional release last month.
Garces began last season in the Boston bullpen but underwent
surgery to remove bone chips from his elbow in September and
appeared done.

WASHINGTON: the allegations. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Born Sabri al-Banna in Palestine in 1938, he grew into a
pro-Nasser Palestinian nationalist. After briefly working in Saudi
Arabia, he moved to Jordan and joined the Fatah, the Palestinian
movement that was the forerunner of the Palestinian Liberation
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, Fatah's chief, sent him to Sudan in 1969, and while
there he apparently first came in contact with Iraqi intelligence
officers.
</P>
<P>
   He briefly returned to the group's headquarters in Amman,
Jordan, but soon came to believe that Arafat was too willing to
compromise with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   He was next sent to be the PLO's representative in Bagdhad just
as Iraq's relations with the PLO were souring. Bagdhad refused to
turn its army loose to support the Palestinians during the Black
September uprising against Jordan in 1970. Abu Nidal, already on
the outs with the PLO leadership, allied himself with the new Iraqi
leader, Saddam. In 1973, he confiscated the PLO's offices and
resources in Bagdhad and declared that he had officially broken
with the PLO. With Iraqi weapons, training and intelligence
support, he began a wave of terrorist actions beginning in 1973,
when his group occupied the Saudi Arabian embassy in Paris and took
11 people hostage.
</P>
<P>
   He stayed in Iraq until November 1983, when he was forced out by
Saddam, who then needed Western support in his war with Iran.
Saddam's regime had also discovered that Abu Nidal had established
a secret intelligence relationship with Syria while still operating
out of Bagdhad.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Nidal moved to Syria, staying until 1987 and carrying out a
long string of terrorist acts against other Arab and Jewish
targets, often working with Syrian intelligence. In 1986, Abu Nidal
provided Syrian air force intelligence with the suitcase bomb used
in an abortive attempt to blow up an El Al airliner in London,
Middle Eastern officials allege. A Syrian intelligence agent, Nezar
Hindawi, was later convicted for attempting to have his girlfriend
carry the suitcase aboard an El Al plane at Heathrow Airport in
London.
</P>
<P>
   But Abu Nidal once again had a falling out with his hosts, after
Syrian intelligence caught one of Abu Nidal's lieutenants at the
Damascus airport carrying sensitive documents and found weapons he
had stored in Syria without their knowledge, according to Middle
Eastern government officials.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, his organization relocated to Libya, while Abu Nidal
moved to Poland for a year, where he was protected by the security
service of Warsaw's communist regime.
</P>
<P>
   In Libya, internal feuds ripped his group apart. In 1989 and
1990, hundreds died in battles between Abu Nidal and dissidents
supported by the PLO who sought to take control of his operations
in Libya and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1998, after Abu Nidal moved to Egypt, a fundamentalist
mosque in Sanaa, Yemen was bombed. In July, an Egyptian radical
sheik, Mohammed Salah Abdal Mottalib, was murdered at another
mosque in Yemen.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Hayat, a London-based Arab newspaper often used by militant
groups to issue statements, reported that one of the suspects in
the killing was affiliated with the Abu Nidal organization.
</P>
<P>
   Middle Eastern government officials with sources in the Abu
Nidal organization also say that his group was behind the mosque
bombing and the attack on the sheik. In May 1998, the officials
said, he met with Rifqi al Mahseri, a cadre in his special missions
committee, and told him to plan to carry out the murder, but to act
only after received a coded message from Abu Nidal.
</P>
<P>
   On July 3, 1998, while living in Cairo, Abu Nidal was confronted
by 10 members of his organization who wanted to end his control
over the group. But the Egyptian government, tipped off to the coup
attempt by one member of the group, convinced them to hold off. Two
days later, on July 5, the Egyptians arrested Abu Nidal and
eventually ordered the 10 dissident members of his group out of
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Nidal was apparently able to order the murder of Salah from
jail in Cairo, the Middle Eastern officials who have investigated
Abu Nidal's activities in Egypt say. But his time in Egypt was
limited. While it is not clear how long he remained in jail, after
the coup attempt failed, the officials said, Abu Nidal remained in
Cairo until his move to Bagdhad was arranged.

A MEETING OF CONTRASTS AS PRESIDENT GREETS POPE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Sub to correct slug. Pope-Clinton sty will move shortly.) 
 
By KIM COBB 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Pope John Paul II's meeting with President Clinton
on Tuesday presented a stark contrast between the world's most
popular spiritual leader and this country's most visible,
self-described sinner.
</P>
<P>
   A cross section of Catholic leaders had said they would not
expect John Paul to use his brief visit to the United States to
chastise Clinton. The consensus was that the pope is far too savvy
a politician for that.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Michael Miller, president of the University of St.
Thomas in Houston, said the pope tends to criticize systems, not
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really not his style to address something which could so
quickly be turned to partisan use,'' Miller added.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, a Southern Baptist, greeted the pontiff warmly upon his
arrival at the St. Louis airport. A few minutes later the pope
referred to ``times of trial, tests of national character'' and
challenged Americans to reach for a higher moral vision.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the same Catholics who say they don't think the
country needs spiritual healing in the wake of the president's sex
scandal and subsequent impeachment concede they would like to hear
what John Paul has to say on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is known for his ability to ``compartmentalize'' his
thoughts and feelings about one issue while he tackles another.
</P>
<P>
   So apparently too are American Catholics, who are celebrating
the pope's visit even during this current period of political
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't hear the kids talk about the president, but they get
pumped up about a 78-year-old man,'' said Mary Thole, youth adviser
to a group of Catholic teen-agers from Highland, Ill., attending
Tuesday's rally and prayer service.
</P>
<P>
   In his last visit to the United States in 1995, John Paul chided
Americans repeatedly for public and private immorality. His
frequent message, particularly to young people, is that a
permissive morality reduces freedom to a license to do as one
pleases.
</P>
<P>
   But even as sociologists talk about a deep distrust of rigid
authority among Americans born after World War II, the most
prosperous religious communities tend to be more rule-oriented than
others, said one expert on popular religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody's going to benefit (from Clinton's problems) it's
maybe that the religious leadership goes up in public esteem _
people you look up to for moral leadership,'' said Charles Howard
Lippy, Martin Professor of religious studies at the University of
Tennessee at Chattanooga.
</P>
<P>
   But Howard noted that ``the religious world'' has suffered under
its own share of sex scandals in recent years, including those of
Catholic priests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're discovering that clergy are no different than
other folks,'' Lippy said. ``We all have problems when those people
get caught.''
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Oksiupa, a student at St. Louis University, said, ``I
guess I hope he'd be addressing some of (the President's) problems.
I'd actually like to hear what (the pope) would say about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Oksiupa, 19, said she expects the pope's visit to be
overshadowed by public interest in Clinton's trial before the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   And some Catholics confessed that they'd would have liked to be
the proverbial ``fly on the wall'' when the president met privately
with the pope if the two discussed Clinton's trangressions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard a lot of people talk about the dichotomy of the
president talking to the pope,'' said St. Louis resident Frank
Fick. ``It's an interesting transposition of values.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if the president brought it up, but I
wouldn't expect the pope to,'' Fick said.
</P>
<P>
   The world leaders met privately for about 20 minutes. Their
respective press aides said Clinton and the pope talked about
challenges to peace and justice around the world, religious
freedom, and the pope's hope that the value of human beings will be
defended and protected in all circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The pope told the president that Clinton and all the other U.S.
leaders were in his prayers.

ADVERTISING COLUMN: PROCTER &AMP; GAMBLE SHRINKS AD AGENCY ROSTER
AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Ohio)  (nk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Procter &AMP; Gamble Co., the world's largest
advertiser, is reducing its agency roster again in a paring that
ends a relationship with one shop dating back 43 years.
</P>
<P>
   P&AMP;G said Tuesday that it would shift the North American and
European accounts of five well-known household brands with combined
billings estimated at $100 million to $125 million from offices of
Euro RSCG Worldwide in New York, effective on April 1. The brands
leaving the Euro RSCG agencies, primarily Euro RSCG Tatham in
Chicago, are being consolidated at other roster shops that handle
more P&AMP;G assignments around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Euro RSCG Tatham and predecessor agencies had worked for P&AMP;G
since 1956; the first assignment was Fluffo shortening (oh, those
vintage product names). Two brands leaving the agency have been
there since they were introduced by P&AMP;G: Clean liquid cleanser,
which came out in 1957, and Head &AMP; Shoulders dandruff shampoo,
which made its debut in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   This is the most sweeping of four roster realignments in the
last year by P&AMP;G, which spends more than $5.7 billion annually on
advertising. Most of the changes have consolidated brand accounts
by designating agencies to handle consumer products on a worldwide
basis. Euro RSCG agencies lost one large assignment, the Vidal
Sassoon line of hair care products, in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision is especially difficult because Euro RSCG has
been a good agency partner for many years,'' Denis Beausejour, vice
president for global marketing at P&AMP;G in Cincinnati, said in a
statement. ``But unfortunately, we have never reached a critical
mass of business with them.''
</P>
<P>
   In simplifying its agency lineup, P&AMP;G has favored four other
worldwide networks, developing much closer ties to them at the
expense of rivals like Euro RSCG. They are: Leo Burnett Co. in
Chicago; D'Arcy Masius Benton &AMP; Bowles Communications in New York,
a unit of MacManus Group; Grey Advertising in New York, and Saatchi
&AMP; Saatchi in New York, part of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi PLC.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question they're going to focus on those four
agencies,'' said Bob Schmetterer, chairman and chief executive at
Euro RSCG, a unit of Havas Advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since this is part of a longer-term trend,'' he added, the
account losses were ``not a surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the consolidation, one Euro RSCG agency remains on the
P&AMP;G domestic roster. Jordan McGrath Case &AMP; Partners/Euro RSCG in
New York, which Euro RSCG acquired only last week, creates
campaigns for Bounty paper products, Era detergent and Zest soap in
North America.
</P>
<P>
   Beausejour said that he hoped the acquisition would ``help both
agencies grow to better meet the needs of their clients,'' adding
that P&AMP;G would continue to work with Jordan McGrath on a regional
basis.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, when the acquisition was announced on Jan. 19,
Schmetterer played down the significance of the fact that Jordan
McGrath and Euro RSCG Tatham shared P&AMP;G as a client.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you know why,'' he said Tuesday, adding that executives
had known for about 18 months that such a consolidation was
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Schmetterer confirmed a report this week in the trade
publication Adweek that Steve Dworin, the vice chairman at Euro
RSCG whose duties included overseeing the agency's relations with
P&AMP;G, had left the agency. Schmetterer said the departure was
unrelated to the consolidation, but declined to elaborate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Now for the details of the changes.
</P>
<P>
   First, the two accounts that are estimated to be the largest of
the five. One is Clean, which Euro RSCG Tatham had handled in the
United States. That brand leaves for Grey, making Grey the brand's
worldwide agency.
</P>
<P>
   The other is Head &AMP; Shoulders, a brand that Euro RSCG Tatham had
handled in North America. Those duties shift to Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi,
which handles the shampoo in Asia and Europe. Burnett remains the
brand's agency in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The other three brands involved are Old Spice fragrances and
toiletries, Metamucil laxatives and Clearasil acne medications.
</P>
<P>
   Old Spice sails from Euro RSCG Tatham, which had handled it in
North America, and other Euro RSCG agencies in Europe. Destination:
Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi, which handles the brand in China and Latin
America and becomes its worldwide agency.
</P>
<P>
   Metamucil, handled by Euro RSCG Tatham in the United States and
other Euro RSCG agencies in Europe, moves to Burnett. In a related
move, Burnett becomes the worldwide agency for Metamucil by
assuming from Grey the brand's accounts in Asia, Canada and Latin
America; those shifts are also effective on April 1.
</P>
<P>
   As for Clearasil, that brand is leaving Euro RSCG Tatham, which
had handled it in North America, and other Euro RSCG agencies in
Europe. The new agency will be announced at a later date, P&AMP;G said.
</P>
<P>
   Two other brands that had been at Euro RSCG Tatham, Biz bleach
and Coast soap, have not been advertised for about 18 months.
Gretchen Briscoe, a spokeswoman for P&AMP;G, said those accounts would
remain inactive.
</P>
<P>
   The consolidation will cost Euro RSCG Tatham about $75 million
in billings of total billings estimated at $565 million. In the
last two years, though, the agency has landed assignments with
billings estimated at $230 million from other advertisers like
Bayer AG, the Hunt-Wesson unit of Conagra Inc., Midas Inc., the Red
Lobster unit of Darden Restaurants and Sara Lee Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The other brands consolidated by P&AMP;G in the last year, in
addition to Vidal Sassoon, include Crest toothbrushes, consolidated
at DMB&AMP;B, and Safeguard soap, which left Jordan McGrath and Burnett
for Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi.
</P>
<P>
   The largest of the consolidations came in January 1998 when P&AMP;G
dismissed Wells BDDP in New York, now defunct, and moved United
States accounts with billings estimated at $125 million to Saatchi
&AMP; Saatchi (Oil of Olay beauty products), Grey (Pringles snack
chips) and Burnett (Gain detergent).

 &HT;    County failing Florida's standard for class sizes
 &HT;    By Mary Ellen Flannery
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Class sizes in Palm Beach County have
been among the largest in the state during the past three years and
haven't come close to meeting the state's goals set in 1995 and
1996, according to reports from Florida's Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   The legislature wanted primary grade classes _ kindergarten
through third grades _ to have no more than 20 students. But in
1995, only 4.3 percent of Palm Beach County's first-grade classes
had 20 students or less; the figure was 5.7 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, class sizes have decreased slightly. Out of 442
first-grade classrooms this year, about 10 percent have 20 students
or less. They average 26 students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not where we want to be,'' said Sandra Richmond, school
board chairwoman, who will meet today with other board members to
discuss class sizes for 1999. ``As a teacher, I know the incredible
difference that happens when you take five students out of a class
of 40. We need to start building changes into the budget.''
</P>
<P>
   The school district wasn't alone in its failure. Statewide, 29
percent of first-grade classes met the goal in 1996. Of the largest
districts, Orange County did best with 54 percent of its
first-grade classes in compliance.
</P>
<P>
   But Palm Beach County failed most miserably _ more than
one-quarter of its first-grade classes had more than 30 students in
1996, compared with 8 percent in Broward County and 14.9 percent in
Miami-Dade County.
</P>
<P>
   The reports show that legislative goals don't carry much weight
if they don't come with enough money to accomplish them. In 1995,
the legislature appropriated $40 million to lower class sizes and
then $100 million in 1996. But based on one DOE study of 1996
figures, it would have cost $273 million to hire enough teachers to
meet class size goals.
</P>
<P>
   In Palm Beach County, it would have cost $29 million to hire the
teachers. And buying portable classrooms for every one of the
additional classes would have added about $23.5 million more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, if they gave us the money for teachers to reduce
class size, I'd support leasing portables to meet the need,'' said
school board member Paulette Burdick. ``But did they give us any
money at all? No, they did not.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of lowering class size in 1996, school board members
actually voted to raise it. In third, fourth and fifth grades,
class sizes went from 29 to 31 students, on average. At the middle
school level, they went from 28 to 29.5.
</P>
<P>
   Experts generally agree that reducing class size in the primary
grades is most critical because that's when students learn to read.
</P>
<P>
   However, most studies show that class size has to get down to 20
students to make a difference. Only one Palm Beach County school,
Barton Elementary in Lake Worth, averages 20 students or less in
its primary grade classrooms, and hiring extra teachers to lower
class size there cost the district $425,000.
</P>
<P>
   Districtwide, the average is 26 students in primary grades. But
40 percent of the district's schools had higher averages in
October. At Starlight Cove in Lantana, the primary grade classes
had 31 students on average.
</P>
<P>
   At least one school board member wants less variation in class
sizes across the district for the next academic year. A class size
of 26 should mean no class has more than 26, said school board
member Jody Gleason. ``I walked into a kindergarten classroom last
week that had 27 kids. I don't think that's appropriate,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But it's unlikely the school board will get much state support
soon. While class-size reductions have been discussed in the
Florida Senate, they weren't a priority in the governor's education
package released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Burdick said she was disappointed by the governor's proposal to
set aside $15 million to reward high-achieving schools, but nothing
to reduce class size. Doing that would have helped all schools
become high-achieving, she said.

DAY AFTER SUPREME COURT RULING, PARTIES CONTINUE ARGUING OVER
CENSUS
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Partisan lines hardened on Tuesday over the 2000
census, as the White House said it was strongly considering a
proposal to produce census figures using statistical sampling that
states could use for drawing legislative districts, while
Republicans vowed to fight any such plan in the courts and
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The new round of sparring came the day after the Supreme Court
ruled that sampling, a statistical technique, could not be used to
adjust the 2000 census for the purposes of apportioning seats in
the House. The ruling was a victory for Republicans because
sampling tends to increase the count of Democratic-leaning groups,
including immigrants, ethnic minorities and city dwellers.
</P>
<P>
   But the court left the door open to using sampling for other
purposes, including possibly redistricting and allocating federal
money. And White House officials said on Tuesday that the
administration was considering plans to produce two sets of
official census data in 2001: one based on a traditional head count
to be used for apportioning congressional seats, and another
adjusted by sampling that states could use to draw lines for
federal, state and local political districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our understanding,'' said Barry Toiv, a White House
spokesman, ``that the court affirmed the use of scientific sampling
for allocating federal funds and providing data to the states for
redistricting. The president still believes that every individual
ought to be counted. And the Census Bureau has already begun
working to make sure the census is accurate but also accommodates
the court's ruling.''
</P>
<P>
   But producing two sets of official census figures would increase
the price of the 2000 census, now placed between $4 billion and $6
billion, by $1 billion or more, administration officials said. And
on Tuesday, House Republicans said they would fight any efforts to
spend money on sampling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will give them the money for an actual count, not a poll,''
said John Feehery, a spokesman for Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican officials believe their party would lose control
of several state legislatures if sampling is used in redistricting.
For that reason, many Democrats and census experts said they
expected House Republicans to make census financing a major budget
issue in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   And the leader of a conservative legal group said on Tuesday
that his organization would urge House Republicans to hold firm
against sampling, even if it leads to a budget impasse and shutdown
of the federal government, similar to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you Republicans don't have a good track record in
standing up to this president,'' said Matthew J. Glavin, president
of the Southeastern Legal Foundation, a conservative group in
Atlanta that filed the legal challenge to sampling. ``We have to
see whether the Republicans have the will to battle the president
on this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if such an impasse were possible, Feehery said, ``I
certainly hope not. But it remains to be seen how this will play
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Producing two sets of census data would be a major logistical
problem for the Census Bureau, which is required to give census
figures to the states for redistricting by April 1, 2001. And
having two sets of data to choose from would create immense
political headaches for state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would put the states in a very difficult position,'' said
Tim Storey, a redistricting expert for the National Conference of
State Legislatures. ``They would have to choose one, and there is
no bright-line legal precedent to help. And whichever unit they
use, they will be sued.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not sampling is used, both the Clinton administration
and congressional Republicans said they were developing plans
designed to count traditionally undercounted groups. In 1990, the
census missed 8.4 million people and double counted 4.4 million
others, according to an analysis the government conducted later.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce Secretary William M. Daley said in a telephone
interview on Tuesday that the Census Bureau would be releasing a
plan in the coming weeks that calls for spending additional money
on advertising in immigrant and minority communities, hiring
community residents to serve as enumerators and recruiting
community groups to help promote the census in hard-to-reach
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that if somebody doesn't want to be
found, they won't get found,'' Daley said. ``But that means we have
to do more on outreach, more on advertising, a better mailing list,
greater outreach.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are also preparing a census outreach plan. In a
speech he is scheduled to give on Wednesday, Rep. Dan Miller of
Florida, who is chairman of the House subcommittee on the census,
will call for adding $300 million to the federal budget for
promoting the census in undercounted communities.
</P>
<P>
   Miller will also propose teaching about the census in schools,
establishing a grant program to help municipalities promote the
census and hire at least 100,000 additional census enumerators to
work in traditionally undercounted communities.
</P>
<P>
   But some Democrats and immigrant groups contend that without
sampling, the Census Bureau will still get a severe undercount no
matter how much more it spends on outreach. ``History has shown
that is not effective,'' said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y.

BRAZIL'S CURRENCY PLUNGES IN A DAY OF WIDE SWINGS
</HEADLINE>
  (See also BRAZIL-PRICES) 
 (nk) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Brazil's currency swung wildly in
foreign-exchange dealings Tuesday and briefly fell to a low of
nearly two to the dollar because of growing uncertainty about the
country's economic health.
</P>
<P>
   The volatility in the currency, the real, came as another credit
rating service lowered its assessment of Brazil's ability to repay
debts. The action by Fitch IBCA, coming atop a downgrade by the
Duff &AMP; Phelps service on Monday, partly reflected worries that the
government lacks the leadership to deal with an economic crisis
that is growing more acute.
</P>
<P>
   But the anxiety about Latin America's largest economy appeared
to have little effect on the stock market, where the key index rose
6.33 percent on purchases by investors who thought shares were
selling at bargain levels.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil has been in an increased state of economic turmoil since
the government abruptly decided more than a week ago to stop
defending the value of the real by buying the currency in the
foreign exchange market. It had spent billions of dollars in
foreign reserves with that approach but the real's value kept
falling.
</P>
<P>
   The cheapened currency, in turn, has unnerved consumers and
investors because it threatens the return of higher inflation and
has raised the costs of servicing the country's foreign debts. An
estimated $42 billion in debts is coming due in the next few
months.
</P>
<P>
   But with pressure growing for economic austerity measures from
the government, the central bank's president, Francisco Lopes, told
the Brazilian Senate on Tuesday that no new steps were forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   A team of technical experts from the International Monetary Fund
arrived in Brazil to review the country's economic performance
under an agreement for a $41.5 billion standby loan. The fund's
approval will be needed before a second allotment of the loan,
originally due to be disbursed in late February, can be released.
</P>
<P>
   The main barometer of Brazil's economic slide has become the
real, which fell Tuesday to 1.955 to the dollar before rebounding
to settle at 1.85, compared with 1.78 on Monday. At many banks,
which charge foreign exchange fees, citizens and tourists had to
pay a rate of two reals to the dollar.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This week, the Brazilian Congress is scheduled to vote on 28
billion reals ($16 billion) of cuts to this year's budget, and to
finish voting on Social Security reform legislation. It will also
vote on extending and increasing a tax on financial transactions.
</P>
<P>
   But without any more ambitious plans to cut costs, economists
said, the Brazilian government risks a repeat of the kind of
capital flight and panic that has gripped the nation for much of
this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the events of the last week or so, you get the
impression that the government has just taken a back seat,'' said
Philip Smith, a banking expert at Fitch IBCA. ``What you've got is
very much a void where people don't know what the strategy is.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, simultaneously
facing a punishing recession and the return of high inflation,
convened panels of ministers to find ways to invigorate economic
growth. Finance Minister Pedro Malan was not included on either of
the panels. Joao Pimenta da Veiga, the government's communications
minister, said, however, that Malan would be consulted.
</P>
<P>
   Telling the Senate Economic Affairs Committee not to expect any
new austerity package, the central bank's Lopes said the votes that
would be taken this week were ``of the greatest importance, and are
sufficient for the consolidation of the program of stability.''

KINGS HAVE A LOT TO OVERCOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has come down to 37 games and 81 days for the Kings, a time
when all they have to do to save their season is find scoring
balance, develop a power play, learn to win at home, learn to get
off to good starts in games, and, oh yes: Major players have to
stay healthy.
</P>
<P>
   If they can accomplish all these things, they can still make the
playoffs. If not, the five-point gap that separated them from the
playoffs at the All-Star break will assume mountainous proportions,
and the Kings (16-25-4) will look back on their final season at the
Forum as one of disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   As far as coach Larry Robinson is concerned, it's a matter of
getting a commitment from all of his players. That commitment will
be tested immediately when the Kings begin a four-game trip tonight
against the Dallas Stars, who have the best record in the National
Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   ``To play the game, it's difficult,'' Robinson said. ``You're
going to have to take bumps and bruises and get hit with the puck.
It boils down to how much commitment you have to winning games. The
teams that are going to be successful are the teams that are going
to be committed to winning hockey games.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he was questioning some of his players'
commitment, Robinson said: ``I think they're trying. But a lot of
times, they almost think they're doing what they're supposed to do.
But they don't realize their feet aren't moving. They think they're
working hard. But maybe they're working hard the wrong way. They're
going south when the play is going north.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from avoiding injuries, which is out of their control,
there are several things the Kings can and must do consistently if
they are to turn their season around:
</P>
<P>
   _Get off to good starts. The Kings are only 2-19-1 when allowing
the first goal, 0-12 when trailing after one period and 0-15 when
trailing after two. Sluggish starts _ and the inability to recover
from those starts _ have been hurting the Kings all season.
</P>
<P>
   _Win at home. When the Kings concluded their recent home stand
with a 1-3 record, Robinson said he actually was happy that the
team was about to hit the road. The Kings are an abysmal 8-13-3 at
home, a comparatively acceptable 8-12-1 on the road.
</P>
<P>
   It is imperative that the Kings establish a home-ice advantage
for the final two-plus months of the season. Eight of their final
17 games at the Forum are against the Mighty Ducks, San Jose,
Edmonton, Vancouver and St. Louis _ teams they are battling for a
playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   _Get production from Jozef Stumpel. Injuries have slowed the
Kings' top center most of the season, and after getting 79 points
in 1997-98, he has only 18 this season. But with 37 games left, if
he could produce a point a game the rest of the way, it would help
the Kings immeasurably.
</P>
<P>
   _Score on the power play. The Kings hoped to improve on the
power play with the signing of free agent Steve Duchesne last
summer, but instead, they are worse with the man advantage than
they were a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   How much difference would even an adequate power play have made
this season? Of the Kings' 25 losses, 10 have been by one goal; in
four other games, they were losing late by one goal and wound up
losing by two when they pulled the goalie and allowed an empty-net
goal. In those 14 games, the Kings' power play was a combined 6 for
68 (8.8 percent), compared with a 12.7-percent overall productivity
rate, which is dismal in its own right.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the Kings' power play is costing them games. But in
Robinson's eyes, greater commitment from his team would mean at
least as much as a potent power play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still making fundamental errors that shouldn't be there
at this point,'' Robinson said. ``It's not that we haven't told
them. A lot of it is their concentration level, when they get on
the ice, is not what it should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing I see is there isn't that commitment from
the first guy on the forecheck to go and go hard. He knows where to
go, but he's not going with the conviction of getting the job done.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you watch the game, watch how a guy goes. If he goes with
his feet apart and is gliding to be in position, he's not working
hard. When we don't have success, we're gliding. When we're going
hard and our feet are moving, then you've done your job.''

MRV COMMUNICATIONS STOCK BOUNCES BACK WITH GAIN OF OVER 20 PERCENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Shares of telecommunications equipment specialist
MRV Communications Inc. surged more than 20 percent for their
biggest gain since the stock melted down five months ago.
</P>
<P>
   MRV rose $1.6975 to $9.875 a share Tuesday with 2.97 million
shares changing hands, or six times the 30-day average volume. The
upward spike followed an announcement of new router and switching
products for networks along with analyst Richard Berry of J.P.
Turner &AMP; Co. issuing a ``trading buy'' recommendation with a
three-to-six month target of $12 to $13.
</P>
<P>
   The run-up erased a significant chunk of the issue's Aug. 28
plunge, which saw shares fall from $14.375 to $6.8125 after MRV
announced a downbeat third-quarter forecast due to slow European
sales and delays of new products. MRV shares are still down 31
percent from the Aug. 27 close and 74 percent off the all-time high
of $38.75 in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Fredrik Tjernstrom of Emerging Growth Alert, who issued
a ``buy'' rating on the stock after the August decline, said MRV
had fallen out of favor with investors due to concerns about its
ability to produce profits after recent acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Tjernstrom also said it would be no surprise for MRV's stock to
keep rising due to the strong fiber-optic products in development.
</P>
<P>
   The company made the product announcements Tuesday at the Comnet
trade show in Washington, D.C. It will ship the GFS3012 switch
router, listed at $7,995, next month and the AccelRouter, listed at
$13,995 with the ability to boost network performance by as much as
100 times, in March.
</P>
<P>
   MRV's third-quarter earnings declined sharply to $1.55 million,
or 6 cents a share, from $5.92 million, or 23 cents a share, in the
same period in 1997. Sales amounted to $62.3 million, compared with
$42 million in the year-earlier period, but were down $3.4 million
from the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to report fourth-quarter earnings Feb. 16.

POPE SPEAKS ON MORAL AGENDA FOR U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Inserts 2 grafs beginning ``The crowd of 20,000.'' Changes
wording of the following 2 grafs.)  (See also POPE-CLINTON, POPE-EXORCISM, POPE-JEWS) 
(lb) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Ignoring the moral lapses of President Clinton, Pope
John Paul II flew into in St. Louis on Tuesday and addressed the
broader moral failings of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In a crowded airport hangar, the pope referred to the infamous
1857 Dred Scott case affirming slavery, which was heard in St.
Louis, and called it a ``time of testing,'' which the United States
failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``America faces a similar time of trial today,'' the pope said.
``Today the conflict is between a culture that affirms, cherishes
and celebrates the gift of life and a culture that seeks to declare
entire groups of human beings _ the unborn, the terminally ill, the
handicapped, and others considered `unuseful' _ to be outside the
boundaries of legal protection.''
</P>
<P>
   The president and Mrs. Clinton greeted the pope, who shook hands
with them briefly before turning his attention to the cheers and
the outstretched hands from the first row of seats. He blessed
2,000 people _ mainly Roman Catholic families with young children,
selected by their parishes _ and bent over to pat a small child.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who guided the fragile pope down a red carpet with a
protective hand on his elbow, smiled broadly and introduced him to
people in the audience like a solicitous host.
</P>
<P>
   The entire world had been tut-tutting about the uneasy
juxtaposition of the highest moral authority of the Catholic Church
shaking hands with an American president on trial for lying about
extramarital sex. Clinton looked completely at ease. And the pope
was unlikely to be shaken by Clinton's noisy scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican's main concern was that the pope's message to
Americans not be drowned out by the awkward iconography of the
moment. The Clinton scandal all but obliterated news of the pope's
visit to Cuba in January last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only a higher moral vision can motivate the choice for life,''
the pope said to strong applause. ``And the values underlying that
vision will greatly depend on whether this nation continues to
honor and revere the family as the basic unit of society.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the two leaders sat in a small room on white
armchairs for photographs before their 20-minute meeting. They
exchanged a few words, and Clinton told reporters he was planning
his own trip to Mexico soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to increase the involvement of the United States,'' he
said, words that seemed aimed at pleasing his guest, who throughout
his stay in Mexico repeatedly reminded the United States of its
responsibility to poorer nations in Latin America. ``I am looking
forward to hearing what the holy father has to say about his
trip,'' Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican has often expressed its opposition to some areas of
U.S. policy, including abortion, land mines, the death penalty and
the bombing of Iraq. The pope's prepared text had references to
those issues, but he skipped over them in his speech. Vatican
officials said that even in private the pope was unlikely to raise
issues on which the disagreements between Washington and the
Vatican are deep, longstanding and well known.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the White house said the two men discussed the need for
continental solidarity and stressed the role of the United States.
The pope praised U.S. efforts to help victims in Central America,
as well as to promote religious freedom in totalitarian countries.
The pope alluded to abortion by stressing the need to protect all
human life.
</P>
<P>
   They also discussed Mexico and Cuba. The Vatican spokesman,
Joaquin Navarro-Vals, said they did not discuss the Monica Lewinsky
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said the pope told Clinton that he ``and all
American leaders'' were in his prayers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Vatican was fully aware ahead of time that Missouri had
decided to postpone the execution of a death-row inmate while the
pope was in St. Louis. The pope apparently did not mention it. On
the plane from Mexico, the pope's spokesman described the
postponement as a ``mockery.''
</P>
<P>
   John Paul II had just spent four days in Mexico engulfed by
adoring crowds who lined up by the tens of thousands along his
motorcade routes and camped out overnight in front of the Vatican's
diplomatic residence in Mexico City, where the pope stayed,
serenading him all through the night. The thin welcome at the St.
Louis airport was starkly different.
</P>
<P>
   For security reasons, crowds had been discouraged from going to
the airport, and the sidewalks along the motorcade route into the
city were empty. By the time the pope reached Kiel Center, a huge
indoor sports arena for basketball and ice hockey, to address a
youth rally, the city warmed up.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 20,000 teen-agers waved yellow scarves, screamed
and chanted ``We love you'' as the pope drove into the arena in a
white golf cart blessing the crowds. Before the pope entered the
arena, Mark McGwire, the St. Louis Cardinal, who is a Catholic,
greeted him and kissed his right hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christians are always in training,'' he said. ``Freedom is not
the ability to do anything we want,'' he warned. ``Rather, freedom
is the ability to live responsibly the truth of our relationship
with God and with one another.''
</P>
<P>
   John Paul II urged the youths to train for their vocation as
Catholics the way McGwire and Sammy Sosa would train for the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a really awe-inspiring guy,'' said Sean Asher, 15, who
drove in with his Catholic youth group from Springfield, Mo. ``You
gotta see him in person,'' he added, referring to the pope.
``Pictures just aren't enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who did not attend the rally, flew back to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The pope has had three meetings with Clinton. They were always
cordial, but neither Washington nor the Vatican claims their
relationship to be anything more than that. If anything, it may be
less; Clinton dismayed the Vatican when he took communion at a Mass
in Soweto, South Africa, in March last year. The pope did not say
anything about it publicly, but Cardinal John O'Connor, archbishop
of New York, expressed his disapproval openly and firmly.
</P>
<P>
   Vatican officials have never publicly discussed the Lewinsky
affair or Clinton's impeachment trial. The Vatican newspaper
Osservatore Romano has run only one article on the scandal, a
neutral report the day he was impeached.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, Vatican officials make the same kind of jokes about
the scandal as officials and diplomats in other European capitals.
But church leaders have not entirely hidden their disapproval from
their followers. Avvenire, the daily newspaper of the Italian
Catholic bishops' conference, has printed regular reports. A few
have quite vividly expressed deep disapproval of the American
president and the voters who continue to support him.
</P>
<P>
   As a columnist for Avvenire, Romanello Cantini, put it in July:
``Unfortunately, the average American, converted by widespread
permissiveness and complete indifference to what goes on in the
private domain, no longer seems to be shaken by old-fashioned
puritan indignation. The majority of Americans believe that Clinton
has lied but that he is above all a simpatico Pinocchio who must be
forgiven that his nose is growing at least as long as the economy
grows alongside it.''

THREE POTENTIAL JURORS PICKED IN JASPER CASE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATTY REINERT 
and RICHARD STEWART 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ A potential juror in the trial of a white
supremacist accused of dragging a black man to his death last
summer was excused Tuesday after saying a relative had received
racist letters from the defendant.
</P>
<P>
   The man was one of seven people dismissed as lawyers began
individually questioning 122 prospective jurors. Three others made
the cut.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Halmon, a white construction worker, volunteered that he
had read letters addressed to his step-granddaughter, Michelle
Chapman. The prospective juror said he didn't know capital murder
defendant John William ``Bill'' King personally and wasn't biased
against him. But he also said, ``I have the thought that he is
guilty,'' and after repeated questioning, conceded that opinion
might prevent him from being a fair juror.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman, who is listed in court papers along with about 50
others who have been subpoenaed as potential witnesses, is one of
several young girls King had written to while he was serving time
for probation violations at the Beto I prison in Tennessee Colony
from 1995 to 1997. Some of the letters, which were romantic in
nature but also included anti-black comments, were turned over to
investigators by the girls' parents shortly after King's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities also have theorized that King was trying to organize
a racist gang in Jasper, and had talked of planning a violent
racist act. But District Attorney Guy James Gray refused to comment
Tuesday on whether he would produce evidence during the trial to
confirm that. He also declined to say whether Chapman will take the
stand.
</P>
<P>
   On June 7, a year after King was released from prison, he was
arrested along with two buddies in the death of James Byrd Jr. of
Jasper. Byrd, a 49-year-old black man, was beaten, chained by his
ankles to a pickup and dragged about three miles to his death. His
dismembered body was dumped in the middle of a road east of Jasper,
outside the gates to an old African-American cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   King, 24, has denied involvement in the killing, though police
have said the victim's blood was found on the shoes of all three
suspects.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, King would face either the death penalty or a life
prison sentence. His co-defendants, Shawn Allen Berry, 23, and
Lawrence Russell Brewer, 31, will be tried later.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Jasper County Sheriff Billy Rowles said Imogene
Hopson, a 62-year-old woman arrested after taking a gun into the
Jasper County Courthouse the day before, is Berry's great-aunt.
</P>
<P>
   But Rowles said he was convinced Hopson had no intention of
harming anyone. She simply forgot she had the gun in her purse, he
said. Hopson was charged with unlawful possession of a handgun and
released on $5,000 bond.
</P>
<P>
   Hopson could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday morning, signs were posted at the entrance to the
courthouse, reminding visitors that no guns are allowed inside.
</P>
<P>
   Of the seven people released from jury service Tuesday, one was
eliminated because of a theft conviction and two because they could
not put their personal opinions aside and decide the case based on
what they learn in the courtroom. Four others were dismissed
rapidly when they said they could not vote for the death penalty if
King is convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Those qualified for jury service include an African-American
woman who works as a corrections officer and is married to a deputy
sheriff, a white maintenance man who works for the Post Office and
a white papermill worker.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen more people will be questioned Wednesday, but Gray and
defense lawyer C. Haden ``Sonny'' Cribbs Jr. said they are
concerned about finding 46 qualified jurors from the current jury
pool. That is the number needed before they can begin the final
process of seating 12 jurors and two alternates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest handicap so far is the death penalty,'' said Gray.
</P>
<P>
   And the prosecutor conceded that he might not reach his goal of
finding at least three black jurors to match the racial makeup of
the county, which is about 20 percent black. Gray said that in his
experience, many African-American jurors are disqualified because
they oppose the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, three black men were eliminated and one black woman
was qualified, leaving only 17 more African-Americans in the pool
to be questioned in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But Gray also said he was encouraged to find that only two of
the jurors screened Tuesday were eliminated because of their strong
opinions on King's guilt or innocence. Both were white men.
</P>
<P>
   The black woman who was accepted said she had already formed an
opinion that King could be guilty. But when asked if she could set
aside that opinion and fairly consider the facts and evidence
presented during the trial, she said, ``I have an opinion. I don't
think it would influence my decision.''
</P>
<P>
   She also indicated that she had some religious reservations
about serving on the jury, but said she could handle it. ``If I'm
chosen, I can be on the jury. If I'm not, it won't offend me,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, whose family works either in law enforcement or
corrections, said she also would not be swayed by peer pressure
from relatives or co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   The postal worker also said he wouldn't bow to peer pressure.
``I think I would be a weak person to give in to something like
that,'' he said. And when defense attorneys asked if working for
the federal government would make him more sympathetic to
government prosecutors in this case, he said, ``No sir. I don't owe
my life to them. I owe them my eight hours a day.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   King's father, Ronald, who attended the first day of jury
selection, was absent Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's father, James Byrd Sr., sat on the front row of the
courtroom Tuesday morning, but declined comment. Four hand-lettered
signs written on white poster boards and posted outside the Byrd
home asked the media to stay away. ``No media,'' one sign said,
``Please, no media,'' another said.

DELAHOUSSAYE NEAR MILESTONE
</HEADLINE>
 D-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA -- In a corner of the jockeys' room, Eddie Delahoussaye
appeared at ease as he sat with a warm towel draped around his
neck, awaiting the single mount he was scheduled to ride one day
last week.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed all he needed was a champion's cigar to go with his
peaceful look.
</P>
<P>
   After all, this is a man who has done it all in the past 31
years, providing many memorable moments for Southern California
horse racing fans.
</P>
<P>
   He scored back-to-back Kentucky Derby victories in 1982 and '83
aboard Gato del Sol and Sunny's Halo, respectively. He captured the
1988 Preakness and Belmont Stakes aboard Risen Star and the 1992
Belmont Stakes with A.P. Indy to go along with seven Breeders' Cup
winners.
</P>
<P>
   But as each day passes for the Arcadia resident, he is
constantly reminded of another big day that is looming.
</P>
<P>
   With 5,994 career wins, Delahoussaye needs six more trips to the
winner's circle to become only the 14th rider in North American
racing history to reach 6,000 victories.
</P>
<P>
   He's on four mounts today as Santa Anita's winter/spring meeting
continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing. It will be a great achievement for me
personally,'' Delahoussaye said. ``I've had to battle my weight my
whole career. When I first started riding in 1967, people told me I
wouldn't last a year because I'm as big as I am now. But I love
this sport so much, nothing was going to keep me away.''
</P>
<P>
   With a normal daily schedule of three to four mounts,
Delahoussaye could easily reach 6,000 in the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think about it, just to be riding 31 years is a feat in
itself for a jock,'' Delahoussaye, 47, said. ``I'm not the kind of
guy who starts reminiscing through the years, but I think this
accomplishment speaks as much for my love of this sport as it does
my dedication to it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a dedication the legendary Bill Shoemaker saw during
countless battles with the rider simply known as Eddie D.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that often that guys like Eddie come around,''
Shoemaker said. ``Like Laffit (Pincay) and Chris (McCarron), Eddie
has a great mind and he's got the love for the sport. You need
those two things if you're going to ride this long.''
</P>
<P>
   Alex Solis, who leads Santa Anita's winter/spring title chase,
says racing needs more riders like Delahoussaye.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's everything I pictured in my mind when I came over here
from Panama,'' Solis said. ``It's amazing to watch guys like Eddie
ride as they get older.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may not have the physical abilities or the strong legs he
used to have, but his mind is in great shape. Give him a good horse
and he knows what to do in a race. With all his experience and wit,
he can compete with anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, as Delahoussaye keeps approaching milestones, he is
constantly reminded that the end is nearing. It has become a
nagging question.
</P>
<P>
   ``People keep asking when I'm going to retire,'' Delahoussaye
said. ``How would that feel if someone kept asking you, `When are
you going to retire?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody likes to hear that, especially if you love your job. If
you don't love your job, you could say, `Hey, I'm gonna quit
tomorrow.' But when you love what you're doing, you want to enjoy
every moment of it and not think about what's coming next.''
</P>
<P>
   Delahoussaye may not get the number of mounts he received during
his glory years, but that doesn't mean his work rate has slowed.
He's still out most mornings looking for work along Clockers
Corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Successful people are usually workaholics because they enjoy
what they are doing,'' Delahoussaye said. ``If you start thinking
of the end of your career or job, you start backing off a little
bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be competitive as a jockey, you have to be out there
hustling and promoting ever day. It doesn't matter if you're on top
or not, you have to show your face, and that's what I've always
tried to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Delahoussaye hinted that his career would end if his stock
started to decline. He doesn't need more days like last week, when
he rode only one race on an entire day's card.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you come in to ride one horse and he has a legitimate
chance of winning, it's worth coming in,'' Delahoussaye said. ``But
if it comes to the point where I'm coming in for one horse that's
20-1, then I'd be at the point or stage in my career where I still
enjoy riding, but I'd rather not be riding a 20-1 shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, one last crack at a Kentucky Derby is enough to keep
Delahoussaye working on his diet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to be there if I got a good horse.'' he said. ``I
wouldn't go there just to ride it, I've already done that. But if I
had another realistic chance, I'd love to do it again.''

ANOTHER CHECKPOINT ON NFL EXPANSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to determining which millionaire or billionaire
will be invited to join the NFL's most-exclusive ownership
fraternity, the league can be as dogged as a probation officer.
</P>
<P>
   There are checkpoints every few miles on the road to acceptance,
and the detail work rivals anything your local FBI could muster. If
the league were as vigilant about its background checks of players,
there would be a lot less police notices around the league.
</P>
<P>
   But the league is dealing with a billion-dollar industry here,
not some nickel back who majored in breaking and entering. It will
offer no apology for its pending financial strip search of the
three parties seeking an expansion franchise Michael Ovitz, the Ed
Roski/Eli Broad Coliseum partnership and Houston businessman Robert
McNair.
</P>
<P>
   The league's expansion committee will meet Thursday in Miami,
site of Sunday's Super BowlXXXIII, and get an update on where each
group stands in its bid for a 32nd expansion franchise. That
meeting will be followed by a special league meeting in February,
all leading to some kind of action at the annual March owners
meetings in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The league protects this process better than the Broncos do John
Elway. The line-by-line detail gets hidden by a handful of public
hard-and-fast criteria.
</P>
<P>
   To wit: One individual must own 30 percent of the team. Only
$100 million of the franchise fee can be in the form of debt (i.e.,
a bank loan). Private Seat License money can be included in the
projection, but only after the league has concluded it is feasible.
</P>
<P>
   Any proposal must include some public money, usually in the form
of direct contributions to a new stadium. And while prospective
owners have flexibility in how they erect a new stadium, the league
must sign off on it, too.
</P>
<P>
   Behind closed doors, the league is blunt and stringent. It wants
to see the money. It wants to see fluid dollars, too, not paper
assets, because it expects cash when the time comes to go forward.
It wants background on every minority owner. It wants operating
budgets which include reserves. And it wants to make sure ownership
isn't spreading its assets too thin.
</P>
<P>
   Various sources privy to how these meetings work also admit the
league has a double standard: It can be a stickler on details with
one group and a bit accommodating to another.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Baltimore and St. Louis proposals for expansion franchises
in some ways were better than those in Carolina and Jacksonville,''
said a source. ``In one case, the league just didn't like the
ownership group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The league's priority is to make sure any ownership will be
able to have success,'' said league spokesman Greg Aiello. ``If you
look at some past decisions, you'll see that.'' Exhibit A would be
Tom Clancy getting bounced as prospective buyer of the Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   But once the league has two or three groups in hand that meets
their criteria, the source said, ``things can then come down to
personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the two L.A. groups and Houston reach that point remains
to be seen. There are still questions to be answered about all
three. To wit:
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz/Carson: Beyond some pretty stadium sketches and one public
appearance by Ovitz, the former Hollywood agent, this proposal has
been cloaked in secrecy. Ovitz's rivals say that's because there's
nothing behind the curtain.
</P>
<P>
   No one on the well-healed list of prospective minority owners
has stepped forward publicly. If Ovitz is to be the 30 percent man,
he'll need $150 million of his own money. While his severance check
at Disney was substantial, much of it came in the form of stock
options subject to the whims of Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the partnership Ovitz has with real estate man Hebert
Glimcher, who holds the option on the property and plans to build
the adjacent mall, are still sketchy, too. Is Glimcher a part owner
of the team with Ovitz? How will the league assess his role in the
project, and will it change the way the league looks at Ovitz?
</P>
<P>
   Sources say the league is also concerned about Carson's $180
million contribution via bonds, since the proposal includes a mall
as well as the stadium. It would like to see more direct revenue.
For what it's worth, the city of Carson is still waiting for
paperwork from Ovitz that fleshes out the city's role and potential
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   New Coliseum, Roski/Broad: The addition of billionaire Eli Broad
to the New Coliseum team as the 30 percent front man was a response
to NFL concerns that Roski, the Kings owner and man behind The
Staples Center, was overextended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indirectly, I understand the NFL was very happy to hear (about
Broad),'' Roski said last week. ``If we hadn't done this, there
would have been a question in their minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Roski's Majestic Reality is one of the largest real estate
concerns in Southern California, but his equity there wouldn't have
mattered when the NFL came looking for a check. Now, Roski can
focus on financing stadium construction against his equity.
</P>
<P>
   Broad is no figurehead: He plans to run the franchise. But the
league will need time to investigate his involvement. Plus, the
Coliseum group is still claiming it can raise $100 million through
PSLs. The league is dubious, to the degree that it has hired Max
Muhelman to assess the PSL potential in Los Angeles for both
groups.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL still needs convincing that there is a public investment
at work here. Most of the $350 million the New Coliseum group says
has been committed is in the form of work already done on
retrofitting the stadium after the Northridge earthquake and
neighborhood infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Houston: The McNair group has all of its financial ducks in a
row. McNair recently sold a company for $1.6 billion. He's been
through the process with the NFL, because he investigated buying
the Miami Dolphins before Wayne Huizenga.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Sports Authority (HSA) has already approved its
investment in stadium construction, around $195 million of a $310
million budget, financed by tax surcharges on tickets, hotels and
rental cars.
</P>
<P>
   The county has also donated the land involved; the PSL threshold
has been set at $50 million; and the HSA has already booked other
events into the stadium guaranteeing $35 million in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very fluid,'' said Steve Patterson, a spokesman for the
McNair group. ``All of the details about public investment are
there, and there may be another $200 million available. We don't
have any environmental questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the league thinks, but I've heard people say
the other groups have holes and don't have their financing
together. All I know is that every time we ask the league if they
have any questions, they say we're there.''
</P>
<P>
   At least until someone finds another question to ask tomorrow.
By the time the league meets in March, it will likely be able to
tell you if McNair wears boxer or jockey shorts, what toothpaste
Roski uses, and if Ovitz has any outstanding parking tickets.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the Olympic family, the Atlanta Olympic organizers
have often been looked on as poor relations _ the long-shot bunch
from this Southern city who were, in a stunning upset, awarded the
1996 Centennial Games, then managed to make a mess of them.
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1996 Summer Games, they were criticized for being too
crass in seeking sponsor dollars. During the Olympics, the Games,
mocked by some as the ``Bubba Games,'' were plagued by poor
transportation, substandard living quarters for the athletes and a
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, in what was perceived as an international insult,
International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch
failed to call the $1.7 billion Games the greatest ever, a standard
bouquet thrown to previous host cities.
</P>
<P>
   Now, more than two years after the Olympic flame was
extinguished in Atlanta, Olympic organizers here are set to face
the most serious inquiry into their performance: did they do
anything unethical in obtaining the Games in the first place?
</P>
<P>
   The IOC, having uncovered widespread misconduct in Salt Lake
City's effort to gain the 2002 Winter Games, has said it will
investigate how each city for the last decade earned its
designation as an Olympic site. For the moment, the Atlanta
organizers have been almost defiantly confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``No cash, no scholarships, nothing illegal, unethical,
inappropriate or untoward,'' Billy Payne, the chief architect of
the Atlanta Games, said of his organization's efforts to win the
Olympics. ``We are more than delighted and willing to show that all
that is good about the Olympic Games can be acquired following the
bid rules and doing something as simple as making friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta organizers are particularly defensive about their
behavior during the bid process because winning the bid in 1990 was
a rare and, by their telling, pure moment of euphoria. By their
account, they began the bid process as a core of seven to a dozen
civic-minded lawyers and bureaucrats who, on a relatively small
budget of $7.4 million, traveled to more than 40 countries,
befriending Olympic committee members through Southern charm and
hospitality. Athens reportedly spent more than $30 million in its
failed effort.
</P>
<P>
   They say the gifts they gave ranged from the gimmicky _
pillowcases stitched with ``Georgia on My Mind'' _ to the more
personal. When the late committee member from Cuba, Manuel Gonzalez
Guerra, admired a ceramic bulldog on Payne's desk, the former
football star at the University of Georgia bought a live bulldog
and made sure the dog had its shots and was waiting on the plane
when the Cuban member left.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Battle, the bid committee's roving ambassador, said he
was aware of the so-called agents, or vote brokers who claimed they
could deliver members, but said he was never approached by them. He
joked that the worst indignity he suffered was having to brave the
icy, polluted waters of the Danube River to swim with a
granddaughter of a Slovakian IOC member.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say that I never asked anyone if they were going to vote
for us,'' said Battle, who traveled to more than 40 countries to
enlist support for Atlanta's bid.
</P>
<P>
   There were other actions, however, that perhaps pushed at the
margins of appropriateness and that ultimately spurred others to
speak of what became known as the ``Atlanta model.''
</P>
<P>
   This past weekend, Australia's Olympic chief, John Coates, said
that former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young, also a former U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations and an Atlanta bid committee
member, had toured Africa dispensing aid commitments in exchange
for support for Atlanta's successful bid for the 1996 Summer
Olympics. Coates remarks came as he explained why he pledged
$35,000 each to the Olympic committees of two IOC members from
Africa in a last-ditch effort to ingratiate himself with voters.
Sydney was awarded the 2000 Summer Games by 2 votes over Beijing,
45-43.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drafted the original strategies, and early on had identified
that we had to do something in Africa,'' said Coates, who offered
no evidence of his allegation against Young. ``I came to grips with
that because I knew that's how Atlanta had achieved it, so I didn't
feel uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Through a spokesman, Young denied the allegation. ``It was an
irresponsible comment by John Coates,'' said Lee Echols, the
spokesman. ``It really upset Andy. It was an insulting comment to
make.'' Young has been traveling, and has not returned several
telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Young, who has maintained ties to Africa throughout his life,
has a long relationship with one of the key figures in the Salt
Lake City scandal _ the IOC member from the Congo Republic,
Jean-Claude Ganga. He was one of six committee members expelled
Sunday by the organization's executive board after it found he had
accepted direct payments, free medical care, gifts and travel
subsidies amounting to $216,010 from Salt Lake City's organizing
committee.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Young has acknowledged that in August 1990 _ a month before the
bid vote _ he went to the Congo Republic with sports equipment.
Doug Gatlin, executive director of the committee then, said he was
with Young when they delivered 50 soccer balls, 100 handballs and
200 pairs of gym shorts, all of it donated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We handed it out directly to kids in the villages,'' Gatlin
said. ``He has enormous respect in Africa because he helped put
Africa on the U.S. radar scope while serving under President Jimmy
Carter. He helped make human rights in Africa part of the theme of
the administration. He never needed to bribe anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Gatlin said Young never promised foreign aid on their trips to
Africa. Referring to himself, Gatlin said he made calls to
international sports organizations to inquire about coaching and
athletic exchange programs, but nothing more. He said he shared
Young's belief that their work fell under humanitarian aid and not
under vote buying.
</P>
<P>
   Many African nations benefited from Young's and the Atlanta
organizers' attentions, but the Atlanta organizers emphasize that
it was after the Games were awarded to the city. When told by
Mozambique officials that their female marathoners couldn't afford
proper foods, for example, Young helped send food and protein
supplements to the country.
</P>
<P>
   After getting the Games, the Atlanta organizers helped set up a
training center for African athletes in LaGrange, Ga. With funds
from local residents and the IOC's Olympic solidarity program, the
training center hit full stride in 1994, with 20 athletes from
Africa and the Middle East. They also allowed an association of
African nations, headed by Ganga, the unusual privilege of
marketing its own merchandise during the Games. Host committees are
usually vigilant about honoring licenses to the paying rights
holders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had told every country that we intended to set up a
training center for weather acclimation, and that we'd help in
whatever way we could to make sure teams and athletes got here,''
Battle said. ``We wanted every country to have an opportunity to
compete in the games. But it was never a `vote for us and we'll do
this' kind of deal.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Atlanta won the 1996 Games over Athens, the Atlanta
organizers said they contended with the rumors about how they did
it. The Greek news media charged that Coca-Cola _ one of the
Olympics oldest sponsors _ bought the Games for its home city.
``That's one of the biggest myths,'' Battle said. ``Heck, Coke
would rather have them in Beijing, where there's 400 billion
potential Coke drinkers.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's Olympic spokesman, Ben Deutsch, said the company
policy was not to provide financial support to any host-city bid.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, the German magazine Der Spiegel reported that Atlanta
Olympic officials offered IOC members gold credit cards, free heart
surgery and scholarships for their children, as well as cash. The
Atlanta organizers vigorously deny the charges. Two incidents
involving two of the IOC members implicated in the corruption
scandal, however, have been acknowledged by Payne.
</P>
<P>
   David Sibandze, a member from Swaziland, had a heart attack
while visiting during the bid process. Atlanta organizers paid for
part of his treatment while Piedmont Hospital absorbed the rest.
Sibandze resigned from the IOC over the weekend after it was
discovered that his son was given a job at the Salt Lake City
Economic Development Office.
</P>
<P>
   And Payne said he made calls in 1991 to the University of
Georgia on behalf of the stepson of the IOC member from Russia,
Vitaly Smirnov. The stepson was enrolled at Georgia from 1992 to
1994, but received no scholarship money from the school, according
to university officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nine months after the vote, and all I did was make some
calls like I often do when asked by friends,'' Payne said.
</P>
<P>
   Several Atlanta officials say they were approached in a subtle
fashion by certain members ``to meet privately'' or to discuss
Atlanta's ``chance of winning,'' including once before the vote in
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   And so the Atlanta organizers insist that they will answer fully
and honestly a letter expected to arrive any day from the IOC
asking for details. They are currently reviewing documents
chronicling the two years spent chasing and entertaining Olympic
committee members across the globe. But they have refused to make
those records public.
</P>
<P>
   For Payne, this last look at Atlanta's Olympic experience offers
a chance for, if not vindication, some reclamation of the Atlanta
Games' legacy. ``Hundreds of thousands of Georgians spared no
effort in welcoming the world into our state and community,'' Payne
said. ``I represented them and they should know, as I do, that we
shouldn't bow our heads. We should all feel good about it.''

PANEL NEARS CONSENSUS ON REDESIGNING MEDICARE
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: La., Tenn., Wash., Mich., Calif., Neb.) (bl) 
By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal advisory commission inched toward a
fragile consensus Tuesday on a plan to redesign Medicare as a
marketplace in which the government would compete with private
insurers. But Democrats insisted that elderly people get coverage
for prescription drugs, raising doubts about whether the plan would
save money.
</P>
<P>
   No votes were taken. But it appeared that 8 Republicans were
ready to join 3 Democrats in support of the basic framework
proposed by Sen. John Breaux, D-La., chairman of the 17-member
commission.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's debate, though vehement, was civil. After it ended,
Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., co-chairman of the commission, said:
``Nobody turned over a table and walked out. Nobody blew up the
basic structure. People complained about parts of the proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel, created by law in August 1997, is supposed to
recommend ways of solving Medicare's long-term financial problems.
The deadline for its final report is in just five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Commission members debated radical changes in Medicare that
would affect virtually every baby boomer. Under Breaux's proposal,
Medicare officials, rather than setting prices and reimbursing
doctors and health care providers separately for each medical
service, would offer a fixed amount of money to each beneficiary to
purchase insurance from a private health plan or from the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of this approach say, without definitive proof, that
it could save money because beneficiaries would be more sensitive
to prices and premiums, and would shop around for the best deal.
For the same reason, critics say, elderly beneficiaries would be
more exposed to financial risks and ruin if health costs rose more
than expected, as has often happened.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal Democrats on the commission _ Rep. Jim McDermott of
Washington, Rep. John Dingell of Michigan and Bruce Vladeck, who
ran Medicare for the first five years of the Clinton administration
_ denounced Breaux's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Vladeck told Breaux, ``You are disentitling a generation of
American workers'' to benefits they have been guaranteed since
1965. Dingell said Breaux assumed that ``the private sector will
have some wonderful mechanism, which I don't quite understand, to
save money.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., enthusiastically supported Breaux's
proposal. Two pivotal Democrats on the panel _ Laura D'Andrea
Tyson, former chief economic adviser to Clinton, and Stuart Altman,
a professor of health policy at Brandeis University _ said they
could support it if elderly people were assured of prescription
drug coverage in both the original fee-for-service Medicare program
and in the private health plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drug coverage is the condition of my support,'' Ms. Tyson said
in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials, while holding back public comment till
they see the panel's final report March 1, have told the commission
staff that they have many concerns about Breaux's proposal. They
worry, for example, that benefits would erode and that the federal
subsidy would become less and less adequate over the years.
</P>
<P>
   It became clear Tuesday that Clinton's recent proposal to use
some of the federal budget surplus for Medicare had altered the
politics of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey said the president might have made the commission's work
more difficult because Clinton ``left the impression that there are
no tough choices, that it's fairly easy'' to solve Medicare's
financial problems. On the other hand, Ms. Tyson said Clinton's
suggestion was helpful because it ``put a new source of financing
on the table'' _ $650 billion to $700 billion over 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies fear that Medicare coverage of prescription drugs
would lead to federal price controls, which they say would reduce
their profits and the money available for pharmaceutical research.
But there may be ways of limiting the government's role, commission
members said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, private companies could manage prescription drug
benefits for Medicare, in an effort to obtain discounts from drug
makers and pharmacies and to encourage doctors to use lower-cost
drugs. Moreover, economists said, thought the manufacturers'
average profit on each prescription might decline, the loss of
revenue could be partly offset because the demand for drugs would
increase if Medicare covered them.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux said his proposal was likely to succeed because it was
modeled on the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, which
covers 9 million people. Many lawmakers say HMOs can slow the
growth of Medicare spending, but HMOs have dropped more than
400,000 Medicare beneficiaries in the last six months, saying
federal payments were not keeping up with their costs.
</P>
<P>
   Under Breaux's proposal, a new government agency, known as the
Medicare Board, would supervise both the government-run program and
private health plans for the elderly. HMOs would have to provide
the same types of benefits now covered by Medicare, but Congress
would leave the details to be worked out in negotiations between
the board and private health plans.
</P>
<P>
   Commission members of both parties said they were dissatisfied
with the Federal Health Care Financing Administration, which now
runs Medicare. Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., described it as ``a huge,
unresponsive bureaucracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Breaux's proposal, the Health Care Financing
Administration would run the original Medicare program, but would
no longer regulate HMOs. It would be given new power to negotiate
prices and sign contracts with selected doctors and hospitals, so
it could compete with private health plans.

   WARNER-LAMBERT TO ACQUIRE AGOURON FOR $2.1 BILLION
</P>
<P>
   Warner-Lambert, one of the hottest drug companies in the
industry, announced that it would acquire Agouron Pharmaceuticals,
a small biotechnology firm, for $2.1 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   The deal enables Warner-Lambert to add Agouron's Viracept, the
United States' leading protease inhibitor, to its pipeline along
with several other anti-viral and cancer drugs. Although the deal
was announced after the market closed, shares of both stocks
climbed steadily throughout the day before they were halted in
afternoon trading. Shares of Warner-Lambert rose $1.625, to
$69.125, while Agouron jumped $3.65625, or 6.9 percent, to
$56.8125.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings at four of the largest drug companies _ Merck, American
Home Products, Schering-Plough and Johnson &AMP; Johnson _ met or
slightly beat Wall Street expectations.
</P>
<P>
   MORE INSTABILITY IN BRAZIL
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's currency briefly tumbled to a rate of nearly two to the
dollar as another credit-rating agency lowered its assessment of
the nation's economic prospects and ability to repay debts. But the
stock market rallied as buyers sensed bargains, pushing the main
index up 6.33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has weathered the worst blows of the global economic
crisis and is not likely to suffer severe trauma from Brazil's
instability, top finance officials said.
</P>
<P>
   BOEING BEATS WALL STREET FORECASTS
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, which released fourth-quarter results that were 3 cents
a share better than expected, tried to reassure investors that it
was finally turning itself around. But Wall Street remained
skeptical, sending shares of the aerospace company down $1, to $35.
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT WITNESS ON COMPETITION
</P>
<P>
   A senior Microsoft official testified in the government's
antitrust case that the company tried to persuade Netscape
Communications, its main rival in the Internet software market, to
become less of a head-on competitor.
</P>
<P>
   COCA-COLA EARNINGS DECLINE 27 PERCENT
</P>
<P>
   Confirming the bad news it had warned Wall Street analysts about
last month, Coca-Cola reported its fourth-quarter earnings fell 27
percent as volume and revenue dropped in many parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com, the online retailer, said its fourth-quarter loss
widened less than expected, while sales almost quadrupled, as more
holiday shoppers used it to buy gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Strong international sales and a rejuvenated U.S. restaurant
business lifted McDonald's fourth-quarter profit 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   COMPAQ OFFERS STAKE IN ALTA VISTA
</P>
<P>
   Rod Schrock, the executive who introduced Compaq's Presario line
of personal computers, was named president and chief executive of
the new Alta Vista. Compaq Computer, which owns the Internet search
engine, plans to sell a minority stake in it to the public as part
of an effort to expand Alta Vista into a leading player in online
advertising and shopping. The news follows the collapse of talks in
which Compaq hoped to sell a stake in Alta Vista to Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   MOODY'S LOWERS RATINGS ON MAZDA
</P>
<P>
   Moody's Investors Service lowered its ratings on Mazda Motor's
long-term unsecured debt to below investment grade, citing
continued deterioration in the Japanese car market.
</P>
<P>
   BRITISH NEWSPAPER EXECUTIVE QUITS
</P>
<P>
   David Montgomery resigned as chief executive of Mirror Group,
pressured to leave by board members and stockholders who were angry
over his refusal to consider purchase offers for the company.
Montgomery's departure opens the way for a takeover battle for one
of Britain's oldest tabloid newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   SOTHEBY'S SEEKS EXCLUSIVE DEALS
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent attempt to undermine its archrival Christie's
entry into the potentially lucrative online auction business,
Sotheby's is asking art dealers to sign exclusive contracts that
would prevent them from selling wares through other auction houses
online.

 &HT;    SSharpe lets tongue do his talking
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Shannon Sharpe was telling about the day it became
evident that his tongue was the same as his name:
</P>
<P>
   ``It all began in a speech class in elementary school. The
teacher said, `Now don't any of you help your fellow students, let
me do it.' And then one kid got stuck pronouncing a word and she
was saying, ``Now Johnny, it sounds like . . . It sounds like . .
.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, I piped in, `It sounds like Johnny can't read!'
</P>
<P>
   ``The teacher turned to me and snapped, `Shannon Sharpe, you get
out of this classroom and don't come back until you learn how to
talk!' ''
</P>
<P>
   And learn he has.
</P>
<P>
   The All-Pro tight end of the Denver Broncos is also the league's
top lip. Back in Colorado, he's known as the Megaphone of the
Mountain Zone. Here, four days before the Super Bowl XXXIII
match-up between Denver and the Atlanta Falcons, he's quickly
established himself as the Mouth of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Tuesday's meet-the-team picture day at Pro Player
Stadium. Each marquee player gets a small podium and microphone on
the edge of the field, the press gathers around him and the stadium
clocks are set to 60 minutes, the length of the interview session.
</P>
<P>
   And when the public address announcer finally intoned, ``The
Bronco media session is beginning now,'' Sharpe, with 10 minutes of
wolfin' already in his wake, stopped in mid-sentence, glared in the
direction of the voice and offered tongue-in-cheek annoyance:
``Don't interrupt me.''
</P>
<P>
   He knew he was on a roll. Asked about the Dallas Cowboys, he
shrugged: ``They used to be America's Team, now they're America's
Most Wanted . . . We've got to be America's team now. The
(defending) champs always get that consideration. You always bet
the lead horse 'til he falters. When they saw Secretariat out 21
lengths ahead, no one ran to the window to bet the second place
horse.''
</P>
<P>
   What about the Falcons though? Since he grew up in Glenville,
Ga., played college ball at Savannah State and now lives in
Atlanta's Buckhead section, did he have some special feeling for
the team?
</P>
<P>
   ``Want me to lie or tell the truth? I didn't like 'em. They lost
all the time. If you had a pair of cleats and walked into Fulton
County, they put you in the game. Walk in with $20 and they put you
in the luxury box with the owner.''
</P>
<P>
   But these Falcons are different. They're 16-2 and in safety
Eugene Robinson, they even have a big-league talker of their own.
``Look, you can take a leopard out of the Serengeti and put him in
the zoo, but he's still a leopard,'' Sharpe said in mangled axiom.
``The thing is, Eugene played 11 years in Seattle and they were
terrible _ 3-13, 4-12, 5-11_ and he never said a word. And now he
doesn't want to get into a jawing match with me. He can't out talk
me, he can't cover me one-one-one and even though he went to
Colgate, I'm smarter than him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe calls himself the league's best trash talker _ ``If I
can't upset you, you're not human,'' _ and anyone who saw that
Monday Night game in mid-November and what he did to linebacker
Derrick Thomas and the rest of the Kansas City Chiefs won't argue.
</P>
<P>
   He noted Thomas had undersized feet and equated that to other
body parts and soon the emotional defender was in full meltdown.
Kansas City was hit with five personal fouls in the fourth quarter.
Two were by Thomas, who had Sharpe by the face mask.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Sharpe didn't just rile a team, but part of an
entire stadium of fans. As Denver was trouncing New England in
Foxboro, Sharpe came to the sidelines with a press box phone and,
as NFL Films recorded the moment, he boomed into the receiver ``Mr.
President, bring in the Army, the Navy, the National Guard.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it's the Miami Dolphins and their fans who want his head.
During the Dolphins embarrassing 38-3 playoff loss at Denver, he
needled Miami players: ``How's it feel to have the Super Bowl in
your house and not be invited?''
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, the Broncos now are ensconced in the
Dolphins practice complex. ``I've got Terrell Buckley's locker,''
Sharpe said of the loquacious Miami defender whom he burned for
five catches. ``I'm leaving little notes for him. Mike (Shanahan)
moved into Jimmy's office. We ran 'em right out of their own home.
They locked up their Gatorade on us, but Jimmy's fish tanks are
still in there. Maybe we'll put a little arsenic or strychnine in
'em.''
</P>
<P>
   The one thing Sharpe said he regrets is calling Miami
quarterback Dan Marino ``a loser,'' after the rout. He has
apologized _ thanks, in part, to a no-nonsense call from his
grandma back home.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Porter, Sharpe's 76-year-old grandmother, is the woman who
has hold of his ear . . . and lips. And when you talk to her, you
get to know who Shannon Sharpe really is.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe, his brother Sterling, who played for Green Bay and is
now an ESPN analyst, their sister Sherra, her mentally handicapped
son and four aunts all lived with their grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon slept with his grandma, Sterling with his grandpa. The
roof leaked in one side of the bedroom, which meant Sterling and
his granddad slept in rain coats, while Shannon moved buckets
around the room. The family was the poorest of poor, raising hogs,
picking tobacco and, in Shannon's words, ``workin' from cain't see
to cain't see. Can't see in the dark when you start work before
dawn and can't see at the end of the day when you finish work at
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Shannon always dreamed _ and talked _ of brighter days
ahead he was nicknamed Chateau. It was short for chateaubriand and
stood for a kid who had nothing and wanted the best.
</P>
<P>
   When Sharpe came out of high school, it was Sterling who
convinced him to skip going to the service and give college
football a try at the Division II school. After college, Sharpe
wasn't taken until the 192nd pick of the 1990 NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos gamble paid off. Sharpe is a seven-time NFL All Pro
selection and already ranks third in NFL history _ behind Ozzie
Newsome and Jackie Smith _ in career receiving yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever my play doesn't match my quotes, people will quit
listening to me,'' Sharpe said with a candidness that is often on
the mark. He praises Falcons coach Dan Reeves, who, as the old
Broncos coach, ``believed in me when no one else did. When I see
him we always hug.''
</P>
<P>
   He minces no words when he says the current flap between
quarterback John Elway, Shanahan and Reeves, ``should have been
taken to the high road this week,'' and he makes sense when he said
``there should be a flag for celebration dances if a player's team
is down by more than 14 points.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Atlanta cornerback Ray Buchanan, who showed up Tuesday
wearing a big spiked dog collar to poke fun at the Falcons underdog
role, Sharpe just shook his head: ``He's another one. Who ever
heard of Ray Buchanan before he ever came to Atlanta a year ago?''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe spares almost no one: ``I won't talk about your mother,
your girlfriend or your wife, but other than that . . . If you have
a deformity I'll talk about that.''
</P>
<P>
   As he was talking, the public address announcer said ``the
Broncos session is over. Sharpe momentarily glared _ ``if that guy
interrupts me one more time,'' _ and then picked up where he had
left off.
</P>
<P>
   And as you walked away and he talked on, you remembered
something else he's said about the birth of his babble: ``I
remember my grandma would say child, `Wait 'til you get to school
to talk.' And the teacher would say, `Wait 'til you get home to do
your talking.' Both of 'em wanted me to find someplace else to
talk.''
</P>
<P>
   And now he had.

 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nothing personal. But if your application to the business school
of your choice is rejected later this year, a cold, unfeeling
machine may be at least partly responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning early in February, the two essay questions on the
Graduate Management Admission Test, taken by about 200,000
business-school applicants every year, will be scored by both a
human being and an electronic robot called the ``E-rater'' (as in
``e-mail'').
</P>
<P>
   The essay scoring system was devised by the Educational Testing
Service of Princeton, N.J., a nonprofit educational measurement and
research organization, after more than five years of research and
experimentation. Educators, not all of whom are thrilled about
machines whose inventors claim they are able to read and grade
essays, believe the technology will soon spread throughout the
field of educational testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've given it a thorough trial and are confident that E-rater
will provide a valuable assessment tool,'' said Frederic McHale, a
spokesman for the Graduate Management Admission Council, which owns
and sponsors the test which is is administered by the Educational
Testing Service.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, two experts have read each essay, assigning a grade
ranging from a low of 0 to a high of 6. If the readers differ by
more than a point, the essay goes to a third expert reader, who
assigns a final score.
</P>
<P>
   The E-rater will serve as a second reader. To prevent the
computer from dominating the procedure, if the electronic score
differs from the expert reader's score by more than a point, the
essay will be judged by a second human being before going to a
final referee if the readers still disagree.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, electronic grading has drawn sharp criticism from those
who say a computer cannot judge creativity. ``Computers can judge
only what's been fed into them,'' said Trent Anderson, a spokesman
for Kaplan Educational Centers, a major test-preparation company.
``And a creative writer is someone who writes something that's
never been seen before. Consequently, the computer cannot know
whether what it's reading is good or bad.''
</P>
<P>
   McHale defended E-rater by agreeing with Anderson. ``We're not
measuring creative writing,'' he said. ``We know we can't do that.
Instead, we are assessing organized thoughts through writing on
very specific topics. What we look for are such things as the
organization of ideas and syntactical structure. These things can
be scored by a computer.''
</P>
<P>
   McHale said his company decided to develop the E-rater to cut
costs, to provide test-takers with their scores more quickly and to
improve the objectivity of test scoring. He also said the
technology developed by the Educational Testing Service would be
used to provide instructional services, teaching students how to
improve their writing skills as they take practice tests.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan has issued a list of ``strategies'' likely to impress its
hard-wired brain. These include stressing the importance of making
an outline before writing a test essay, using such transitional
phrases as ``therefore,'' ``since'' and ``for example,'' and using
plenty of synonyms, because ``the computer rewards a strong
vocabulary.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The technology for the E-rater dates to the interest in
artificial intelligence in World War II, which gathered force in
the 1960s with the development of computational linguistics _ the
merging of computer science with the study of language.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, researchers were trying to design a machine that
could read a book and create an index for it. The effort was
successful; today, many word processors can manage the task.
</P>
<P>
   Soon money became available from the federal government and
private industry to advance the study. The Defense Department was
interested in developing language-translating machines, and
telephone companies wanted speech-recognition computers. In
general, they got what they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   A breakthrough came about two years ago, when a development team
at Educational Testing Services led by Jill Burstein invented the
E-rater.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key was that we figured a way to combine many of the
technologies that had been developed up to that time,'' Ms.
Burstein said. ``These included looking at syntactic structure like
finding a subordinate clause, analyzing discourse structure like
where a discussion starts and ends, and looking at topical content
like examining vocabulary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting all this together,'' she continued, ``made possible a
machine for reliable automated essay scoring.''
</P>
<P>
   What lies ahead?
</P>
<P>
   More literate robots in and out of the classroom, specialists
say.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Landauer, a professor of psychology at the University of
Colorado at Boulder who is a longtime researcher in the field, says
he expects that someday the descendants of the E-rater will be able
to teach as well as grade test papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never before had a tool that could help a student learn
without the presence of a teacher,'' Landauer said. ``But soon we
will.''

COMMENTARY: THE APOSTLE OF HYPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (nk)  
 By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The only real question was: How far would Bill
Clinton go to ingratiate himself with the pope?
</P>
<P>
   Would he wear a black mantilla?
</P>
<P>
   Would he kiss the pontiff's ring?
</P>
<P>
   Would the Jesuit-educated Baptist married to the Methodist try,
as the saying goes, to be more Catholic than the pope?
</P>
<P>
   The president is so ingratiating toward the world leaders he
meets with that he actually takes on some of their coloration. With
Helmut Kohl, he expanded with satisfaction. With Boris Yeltsin, he
grew jovial and ruddy. With Nelson Mandela, he drew himself up
straighter.
</P>
<P>
   But this was a tricky one, even for the Great Empath. After
ignoring so many ``Thou shalt not's,'' how could Clinton snuggle up
to John Paul II and wrap himself in the beatific glow of His
Holiness' holiness?
</P>
<P>
   Two of the president's most rabid tormentors, Henry Hyde and his
impeachment lawyer, David Schippers, are devout Catholics who
became papal knights together at a ceremony in Cleveland three
years ago. The House managers were trying Tuesday to lasso Clinton
into making an appearance at his impeachment trial, even as he was
seeking papal indulgence. It would be so helpful, in the
president's personal journey toward atonement, if he could get the
pope to bless his spin.
</P>
<P>
   So there they were Tuesday in a dark, stuffy airplane hanger, an
astonishing odd couple.
</P>
<P>
   The infallible and the inordinately fallible. The moral pillar
and the moral contortionist. The Holy Father and the very Prodigal
Son.
</P>
<P>
   The sign on the bathroom behind the stage where the two leaders
met illustrated the elite nature of the summit, even harder to get
into than the closed-door Senate session. It read: ``President or
Holy Father Only.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an amazing spectacle of religion vs. religiosity.
</P>
<P>
   The pope tries to use religion to make the world a better place.
Clinton uses religiosity tactically to get beyond his troubles with
carnality and mendacity, quoting the Bible, praying with Jesse
Jackson and bringing a team of ministers into the White House to
work on his soul.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a group of scholars on Monday night at a White House
``Millennium Evening,'' the president told them, ``You all know I
am a walking apostle of hope.'' The pope, who ordinarily loves to
lecture Americans about personal morality at the drop of a miter,
steered clear of Clinton's personal morality, in his remarks and in
their private meeting. He gave a sermon against abortion and
euthanasia.
</P>
<P>
   The pope was cordial and businesslike but the president tried
for the personal. Always the respectful protege with older leaders,
Clinton took the pope's arm and helped him around the stage. In his
speech, the president put in a plug for sinners.
</P>
<P>
   ``People still need to hear your message that all are God's
children, all have fallen short of His glory,'' he told John Paul
II. Maybe the pope, who decries capitalism while allowing himself
to be marketed like a sports superstar, wanted to get a boost from
the popular president.
</P>
<P>
   Moral clarity is all well and good, but you've got to keep those
poll numbers up. This month CNN/USA Today/Gallup released a poll in
which the president easily trumped the pope in a contest for Most
Admired Man. Even though the Republicans keep foaming at the mouth,
the president has proved you can govern without moral authority.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, the pope did not want a repeat of last year's visit to
Cuba. Proving that sin gets bigger ratings than spirituality, the
anchors deserted him when the Monica story broke, dashing back to
get all the details.
</P>
<P>
   Before he was felled by sin himself during the 1996 campaign,
Dick Morris bragged that he was running Clinton not as president,
but as pope.
</P>
<P>
   Morris' theory was that you did not need personal values if you
had public values. As he recalled on Fox TV, before the State of
the Union: ``If you wanted to get voters that were turned off by
the way the president behaved in private, he needed to be
advocating a values agenda in public that would appeal to those
people, not economic, but values. ... In other words, essentially,
what the president is doing is saying, `I'm going to help you raise
your children into being better adults than I am.'''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bill Clinton's moral and ethical sloppiness is less
heinous than the unforgiving and hypocritical behavior of Henry
Hyde, Bob Barr and their lynch mob.
</P>
<P>
   It is worse to refuse to forgive than to need forgiveness.

 &HT;    Pope brings message to Middle America
 &HT;    By Charlise Lyles
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Pope John Paul II, stooped, his hands trembling,
beckoned to the young of the Roman Catholic Church to ``be a light
to the world'' in the century to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the world itself seems filled with darkness,'' the
pontiff said Tuesday night. ``The darkness of children who go
hungry and even die. The darkness of homeless people who lack work
and proper medical care. The darkness of violence: violence against
the unborn child, violence in families, the violence of gangs, the
violence of sexual abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands crammed the streets, four and five people
deep, in a wave of humanity seeking to lay eyes on the 78-year-old
pontiff, reaching out to touch those trembling hands.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Dickmann did not touch him. She did not even get close
when the pope entered the Kiel Center where he spoke to 20,000 who
attended the Walk in the Light Youth Rally. But the 19-year-old
University of Dayton freshman said that she felt the Holy Father's
aura of goodness just the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that I will be a better person because of this,''
said Dickmann. ``I believe I will be better in my faith.''
</P>
<P>
   About 4:30 p.m. Monday, after UD classes, Dickmann and a dozen
friends piled in a van and a car and drove six hours through the
heartland to the suburban St. Louis home of Dickmann's parents. At
11 p.m. they made a run for cheesy St. Louis-style pizza. Between 2
a.m. and 4:30 a.m., they tried to sleep. But Mountain Dew and a
Santa Claus-like anticipation kept their eyes open, their mouths
chattering and giggling.
</P>
<P>
   She dressed hurriedly in 5:30 a.m. darkness, downed a breakfast
bar, and the group was off to the pickup point for the downtown
rally.
</P>
<P>
   The confluence of events, the approaching millennium, the moral
debacle that the nation finds itself in as President Clinton faces
an impeachment trial and the pope's message to youth, flowed into a
moment in time that the students felt they should not miss.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, some downtown streets surrounding the Papal
Plaza were empty. So were many parking spaces. The city's
Metro-Link subway had transported only a fourth of expected riders,
St. Louis Mayor Clarence Harmon told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like we gave a party and nobody came,'' he said at
midday, imploring residents to come downtown to greet the pontiff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely surprised and disappointed that there aren't
more people,'' said Pamela Day, a Dallas health-care worker who
drove her mother and three children to St. Louis. ``Especially in
comparison to the reception he got in Mexico. I don't want him to
be disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Some speculated that media predictions of heavy traffic and
crowds kept many away.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day President Clinton and first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton
</P>
<P>
   As Pope John Paul II stepped onto St. Louis soil at 1:23 p.m.
Central Daylight Time at Lambert International Airport, the youth
watching the televised arrival from inside the Kiel Center let out
a deafening shouts of jubilation, then fell silent in prayer. Some
held hands. In some eyes, tears glistened.
</P>
<P>
   By about 6:30 p.m., when the ``POpemobile'' rounded the corner
of Olive Street bound for the youth rally, crowds had swelled
considerably. As dusk fell over the city, a chilly wind whipped
after a sunny day of unseasonably balmy 45-degree weather. The Holy
Spirit Adoration Sisters, known as ``the Pink Sisters,'' had been
assigned to pray for good weather.
</P>
<P>
   In his white skullcap and cassock, the 264th successor to Peter
cut an odd figure against a backdrop of vintage Americana _ Mark
Twain's Mississippi River and floating casinos.
</P>
<P>
   It was a day of sharp contrast. There was the unbridled energy
of youth and there was withering age. Holy serenity and
pandemonium.
</P>
<P>
   There was a pope who has spoken in Mexico against greedy
capitalism as vendors hawked his holy image on souvenir mugs,
T-shirts and scarves for as much as $20.
</P>
<P>
   Bomb-sniffing hounds and police with semiautomatic weapons
cleared the way for a messenger of universal peace and love.
</P>
<P>
   There were the masses and a single man.
</P>
<P>
   They saw John Paul the showman. Once an aspiring actor and
playwright, he oozed charisma. ``I am feeling this is awesome,'' he
told the youth rally.
</P>
<P>
   They heard John Paul the uncompromising moral force. ``Do not
listen to those who encourage you to lie, to shirk responsibility,
to put yourselves first. Do not listen to those who tell you that
chastity is passe.''
</P>
<P>
   The night before, member s of three church reform groups had
gathered for a candlelight vcigial at the cathedral basiclia of St.
Louie to protest the churcsh's refuse to ordain women. But int he
crowd that greeted the pope, some could hardly bring themselves to
speak in oppossition to church teachings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women in leadership is an issue,'' said Mary McKeirnan, 42, as
the papal motorcade approached. ``But he is so uplifting. And the
man has done so much for social justice. He is a pope for the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   And they heard John Paul the recruiter of church personnel.
``Each of you has a special mission in life and you are each called
to be a disciple of Christ,'' he said. ``Many of you will serve God
as priests and religious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt the pope's visit will encourage other young
people to join the vocation,'' said Sister Catherine Marie of the
Dominican Sisisters of St. Cecelia in Nashville, Tenn. Flanking her
were 30 novitiate nuns, ages 17 to 30, their habits bouncing as
they cheered the pope.
</P>
<P>
   And they heard John Paul the lover of young people, who has
spoken he Gospel to thousands of Catholic youth in Mexico City,
Paris and dozens of his 85 trips outside Italy.

CUSTOM CD PLAN SENDS K-TEL'S STOCK UP THE CHARTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Shares in K-tel International Inc. rose as much
as 10 percent on news that the company will offer custom-made music
CDs through its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   K-tel stock closed up 87.5 cents Tuesday at $11.875, for a daily
gain of 7.95 percent. More than 884,000 shares traded hands, or 1{
times the issue's 30-day average trading volume.
</P>
<P>
   The direct music marketer, best known for kitschy television
commercials in the 1970s and '80s, enjoyed a virtual rebirth last
year after moving to an Internet-based business model. Tuesday's
announcement is another step for the organization along that road,
company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In offering custom-made CDs, which customers order by mixing and
matching compositions from a 4,000-item song list, K-tel joins the
likes of Musicmaker.com, online music retailer CDNow and the
now-defunct MyCD.com. The first two each offer far more songs than
K-tel to choose from, but those companies must pay royalties to the
artists. K-tel owns the rights to its songs outright.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a margin standpoint we have a big competitive
advantage,'' said Scott Blum, head of K-tel's online operations.
</P>
<P>
   K-tel's discs are also cheaper. The company charges $10 for 10
songs and 99 cents for each additional track. Other sites typically
charge $15 to $16 for up to 70 minutes of music. Blum declined to
say how much revenue K-tel expects to generate from its custom
music business.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of the suburban Calabasas-based company have surged twice
in the past year, first on news that it was switching to an
Internet model and then that it had signed a licensing deal with
Microsoft. In each instance, K-tel shares climbed to nearly $40
before tumbling back down.
</P>
<P>
   K-tel faces an avalanche of lawsuits stemming from allegations
that it tried to hide from investors the fact that it was being
investigated by the Nasdaq stock exchange last fall for failing to
meet listing requirements.

FLORIDA TRIES USING DNA SAMPLING TO PROTECT CHILDREN
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLANTATION, Fla. _ Lying in a hospital bed a day after giving
birth to her second child, Yanith Martinez has only the highest
hopes for her baby, Valeria.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want her to be an excellent mother and a great
professional,'' she said, signs of fatigue still evident in her
countenance.
</P>
<P>
   But grim reality, not hope, held the upper hand last week, when
Ms. Martinez became one of the first mothers in the nation to allow
the hospital to take a sample of her infant's DNA, along with her
footprints. The blood nurses drew from Valeria's tiny heel will
allow the child, or her body, to be identified should she ever be
switched with another baby, abducted, murdered or mutilated beyond
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``God forbid you should ever need it,'' Ms. Martinez said. ``My
neighborhood is quite calm, with little crime, but you move around,
so you never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerned over a recent rash of highly publicized cases of child
molestation, abuse and mutilation, the Florida Department of Law
Enforcement has begun to encourage hospitals to offer parents not
only footprints of their children, but also samples of their
children's blood, which, like all substances of the body, carry
their genetic blueprint, or DNA, in an attempt to better trace
those who fall victim to violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The program, the only one of its kind in the country, came to
life last December, weeks after Juan Carlos Chavez, a 31-year-old
handyman, was sentenced to death in the abduction, rape and murder
of 9-year-old Jimmy Ryce in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Traces of Jimmy's dismembered body were discovered near Chavez's
home in south Miami-Dade County three months after his
disappearance. Investigators were forced to use DNA extracted from
the traces and compare it with that of Jimmy's parents in order to
identify the body.
</P>
<P>
   Although Florida does not lead the nation in crimes against
children, the state, which has sophisticated equipment for DNA
testing, has become a pioneer in the use of DNA as a form of
identification.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before his death in December, Gov. Lawton Chiles made
child welfare a priority, and victims' parents have made an effort
to bring the plight of their children to public attention.
</P>
<P>
   So far, nine hospitals have volunteered to offer parents the
blood samples, and state officials hope the practice will become
common, eventually replacing footprints as the primary form of
identification.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Nash, the director of the Woman's Pavilion at Plantation
Medical Hospital, said extracting the blood cost the hospital about
$1.40 per child but was being offered free.
</P>
<P>
   The sample is taken from blood that is routinely extracted from
a newborn's heel for a series of state-mandated tests for diseases
like sickle cell anemia and PKU, a rare disorder that can lead to
brain damage or mental retardation.
</P>
<P>
   The sample consists of three droplets of blood that are placed
on special paper the size of a small index card. The paper is
designed to preserve the DNA in the blood for at least 100 years.
The samples are put inside envelopes and given only to the parents
who can store them in a safe-deposit box, the freezer of a
refrigerator or the pages of a Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are seeking to expand the program to include older
children. Next month, four elementary schools in northern Florida
will begin offering free blood samples to parents of the students.
</P>
<P>
   And a bill that would require the state's hospitals to offer the
test to parents of newborns at a ``reasonable price'' is in a
committee of the Florida House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is only the first step in our effort to make the option
available to all parents of all children,'' said Bill Hebrock,
chairman of the Missing Children's Information Clearing House
Advisory Board, which was created by Chiles at the behest of Jimmy
Ryce's parents.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy's parents, Don and Claudine Ryce, who are members of the
advisory board, say their son's fate could have been discovered
much sooner if they had owned a preserved sample of his blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know if your child is going to be taken by a
predator,'' Mrs. Ryce said. ``We believe any caring parent would
want to have a DNA sample.''

SPORTS COLUMN: YOUR TABLE IS READY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. _ Near the front desk at Joe's Stone Crab
restaurant, three dozen people were waiting to be seated when the
maitre d'hotel, Dennis Sutton, heard a voice say, ``The 20 Broncos
are here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bring 'em in,'' Sutton said.
</P>
<P>
   They had arrived in three white stretch limousines from their
Fort Lauderdale hotel and now, as those waiting quickly stepped
aside, these big, burly Bronco offensive linemen moved in single
file through the foyer and the bar to the long table set up for 20
_ the linemen, two assistant coaches, three equipment men and some
of their buddies.
</P>
<P>
   As others in the restaurant stared, this, too, was the Super
Bowl, especially for the Broncos' offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a dinner like this in San Diego a year ago before we
won,'' tackle Tony Jones recalled. ``But when they brought us sushi
to start, some of us couldn't look at it. I told 'em, `Bring me a
steak.'''
</P>
<P>
   Some people were surely at Joe's Stone Crab to dine on Monday
night, but the Broncos were there to eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the guys had never had stone crabs before, but they
loved them,'' K.C. Jones, the backup center who knew the restaurant
from having played at the University of Miami, said Tuesday.
``Everybody ate until they were content, but nobody overate. We
know what we're here for, to beat the Falcons on Sunday _ but
you've got to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, the Broncos' tab was $1,856.92, including
$1,039 for 20 jumbo orders of stone crabs, the Florida delicacy
that made this Miami Beach restaurant famous. It also included
$79.75 for five stone crab cocktails and $59.60 for 14 orders of
key lime pie, plus $11 for two a la mode. Their bar bill for drinks
and beer was $317.50.
</P>
<P>
   ``To pay the tab,'' center Tom Nalen said, ``we used the fine
money from our kangaroo court.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Nalen, the court treasurer, more than $5,000 in
fines had accumulated this season from violations that only the
Bronco offensive linemen recognize.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got fined $100,'' Nalen said, laughing, ``for my wife's
picture being in the Game Day program.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We get fined for crazy stuff like that,'' Tony Jones said.
``Like if your wife gets caught on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   As offensive lines go, these Broncos are different. On most
National Football League teams, offensive linemen weigh more than
300 pounds, the better to block the defensive linemen who weigh
more than 300 pounds. But all of these Broncos are listed at less
than 300.
</P>
<P>
   Not that they're undernourished, but from left to right, the
starters are the 291-pound tackle Tony Jones, the 287-pound guard
Mark Schlereth, the 286-pound Nalen, the 281-pound guard Don Neil
and the 293-pound tackle Harry Swayne _ pro football's lightest
offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   They're usually the quietest line, too.
</P>
<P>
   During the season they prefer not to talk with the news media,
under penalty of a fine from their kangaroo court, but at the Super
Bowl they must be available to talk on Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday, under penalty of a fine from the NFL office.
</P>
<P>
   They're also pro football's quickest and most efficient
offensive line, with two of the best assistant coaches: Alex Gibbs
and Barney Chavous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line,'' quarterback John Elway has said, ``is that
our offensive line doesn't get enough credit. They are the nucleus
of where our offense starts. If they're not doing it up front,
Terrell Davis doesn't have the holes and we don't have the time to
throw the ball. They're the guys that deserve the credit and don't
get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Schlereth, completing his 10th season, has two Super Bowl rings
(the 1991 Redskins and the 1997 Broncos) despite having had more
than 20 operations, primarily for damaged knees and spinal disks.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me,'' he said, ``everything is a game _ cleaning the
kitchen, putting the kids to bed. How many operations can you
endure and still continue to play? Well, all I know is that it's
been a challenge to play through all those injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   And on Monday night it was a challenge for all the Bronco
offensive linemen to eat all those stone crabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any real big eaters now,'' Lane said. ``When we
had Brian Habib, now he was a big eater. He ate everything in
sight. He'd eat dinner, then he'd have a snack an hour later.''
</P>
<P>
   What did Habib weigh?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not much,'' Lane said. ``Maybe 290.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Democrats warned on Tuesday that calling
witnesses in President Clinton's impeachment trial would prolong
the proceedings, but Republicans countered with a plan to appease
skittish moderates that would limit the time for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   The off-the-floor skirmishing, which spilled onto the Senate
floor in closed debate Tuesday night, came after House Republican
prosecutors strengthened their case for witnesses by paring their
proposed list to three people who would, at this point, give
depositions that would be closed to the public: Monica Lewinsky,
Vernon Jordan and Sidney Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday senators are likely to adhere to party lines and
vote against dismissing the two impeachment articles. But a second
vote, on whether to depose the three potential witnesses, is too
close to call, senators said, although both sides said the momentum
was moving toward passage.
</P>
<P>
   One senior Republican senator, Ted Stevens of Alaska, said that
the motion to question witnesses would win more than the 51 votes
required for passage, estimating that it might be in the range of
53-59.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, Republicans cobbled together a proposal
governing how witnesses would be handled, hoping it would satisfy
undecided senators in both parties. At a Republican caucus Tuesday
morning, Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island offered a plan to limit
the questioning of each witness to three hours by the prosecutors
and three hours by the White House and to videotape the witnesses
so senators not at the interviews could gauge their demeanor and
credibility. Some senators suggested that excerpts from the
videotapes could be used in place of live witnesses before the
Senate itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very rational, a very modest proposal,'' said Sen.
Mike DeWine, R-Ohio. ``It is important for many of us who took the
oath, who are still weighing the evidence, who really want to see
these key witnesses testify, to have the opportunity to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, supports
the plan, which could become the centerpiece of a resolution that
guides the Senate through the deposition phase of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate could vote on the plan as early as Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing that they were losing the battle over witnesses,
Democrats immediately took the microphones to play on Republican
fears of a protracted and unseemly spectacle. Democrats cautioned
that by opening the door to witnesses, Republicans would also have
to allow White House lawyers to peruse the 54,000 pages of House
documents they have not seen, as well as documents held by the
independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, a process they said could take
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our colleagues need to clearly understand that if it's a
choice between expeditious and fair, Democrats are going to fall on
the side of fairness,'' said Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the
Democratic leader.
</P>
<P>
   The White House would also have the right to call witnesses,
which presidential aides said would entail lengthy preparations.
``This motion for witnesses is a motion to delay,'' said a White
House spokesman, James Kennedy. ``It makes delay a certainty. There
is no doubt about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans immediately accused Democrats of employing
scare tactics to derail what they said was a legitimate part of any
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that White House has made a threat,'' said Sen.
Jon Kyl, a Republican from Arizona. ``It is not an appropriate way
to influence the Senate in deciding whether to grant the House
managers' motion.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering the third week of the trial, the Senate seems close to
following the same partisan script that engulfed the House's
contentious impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Lott and Daschle have consulted each other regularly through the
trial and brokered an unusual unanimous agreement that has steered
the Senate proceedings up to now.
</P>
<P>
   But aides to Daschle said he had not been told of Chafee's plan,
and several Republican senators said they would use their majority
to muscle the framework for questioning witnesses, if need be.
Daschle, however, has rebuffed several Republican invitations to
talk about witnesses, saying that should wait until after the vote
on depositions.
</P>
<P>
   As Senate Republicans and Democrats jockeyed over the witness
question in corridors, private hideaways and, by Tuesday night, on
the Senate floor itself, Lott was promoting a strategy to end the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Under that approach, the Senate would vote to find that Clinton
had committed the offenses charged in the two articles of
impeachment: perjury and obstruction of justice. After that,
senators would take a second vote on whether to remove him from
office.
</P>
<P>
   It was difficult to judge what chances such a plan would have of
being accepted by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The catalyst for Tuesday's off-the-floor maneuvering was the
House prosecutors' decision, under pressure from Senate
Republicans, to trim their witness list to three people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't what we would like, but we have to be realistic,''
Rep. Henry Hyde, the lead prosecutor, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were virtually united in opposing witnesses. ``They're
just reiterating what they've said from Day 1,'' said Barbara Boxer
of California.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, for the most part, praised the prosecutors. But
Sen. Susan Collins of Maine expressed dismay that they did not put
Betty Currie, the president's secretary, on the list. ``I'm really
surprised and disappointed,'' Collins said. ``She's central to the
obstruction-of-justice charges, and it's going to be harder to
resolve that without her.''
</P>
<P>
   A House Republican aide said the House managers decided that
Mrs. Currie probably would not clear up the question of whether
Clinton was trying to coach her about Ms. Lewinsky's visits to the
White House and would not resolve whether the president directed
her to retrieve gifts he gave Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the House prosecutors asked the Senate to consider,
but not vote on, whether to invite Clinton to submit to
questioning. Sen. Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, said that
senators would welcome the president's testimony but should not
compel it, a common view among most senators.
</P>
<P>
   Lott has not decided whether to request that Clinton testify, a
senior Republican aide said.

CHEMICAL INDUSTRY PLANS TO ASSESS PRODUCT SAFETY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years _ maybe decades _ the chemical industry has argued
that its products are safe, and environmentalists have hollered
back, ``Prove it.'' On Wednesday the Chemical Manufacturers
Association will announce that the industry is spending more than
$1 billion to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are going to advocate decisions based on sound science,
we darned well better have some good science to base them on,''
said Lawrence Wilson, chairman of the big chemical company Rohm &AMP;
Haas, and a member of the association's research committee.
</P>
<P>
   At a luncheon in Washington on Wednesday, the chemical industry
plans to spell out the particulars of a six-year research program
that will gather data on toxicity and other details of nearly 3,000
so-called high production volume chemicals, common substances like
turpentine or acetylene that are produced or imported in quantities
of more than 1 million pounds a year.
</P>
<P>
   Some 15,000 chemical and pesticide ingredients will be screened
to see whether they adversely affect human endocrine systems, and
the mechanisms by which whole families of chemicals _ say, salts,
or halogens _ act on the environment or human health will be
studied.
</P>
<P>
   Although that last effort will probably account for only $100
million of the money, it is generating most of the interest. Many
scientists think it will provide the means to determine when it
does or does not make sense to extrapolate from epidemiological
studies and animal tests to assessments of a chemical's human
health risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will let us apply our understanding of how one chemical
behaves to predicting how a whole class of chemicals will act,''
said Roger McClellan, president of the Chemical Industry Institute
of Toxicology, the industry-financed research center that first
raised an alarm about the link between formaldehyde and nasal
cancers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will not just gather data and do tests, but they will do
true research that can develop better test protocols,'' said Dr.
Lynn Goldman, a pediatrician who until a month ago was the
Environmental Protection Agency's chief chemicals regulator and is
now a visiting scientist at Johns Hopkins University.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the new initiative were presaged on April 21, the eve
of Earth Day, when Vice President Al Gore announced his support for
filling in the data gaps on common chemicals. In November the
chemical association said its members would probably devote $700
million toward that end.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the research initiative is a pre-emptive strike.
``Public policy is increasingly based on science, but without good
data, policy-makers can fall back on overly conservative
assumptions,'' said M.L. Mullins, a vice president of the chemical
association. Translation: The environmental agency and others could
pass rules that make it difficult to introduce new products.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has promised to post all its data on the
association's Web page (www.cma.org) as the data come in.
Eventually it hopes to have a setup in which people could type in
their zip codes and find out the composition and health data on any
chemicals made in their localities.
</P>
<P>
   The approach is already garnering support from what is usually
the opposing camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has total and continuous public transparency, and that in
itself is unique,'' said David Roe, a senior lawyer for the
Environmental Defense Fund, whose 1997 study, ``Toxic Ignorance,''
charged that there was a lack of adequate health data for more than
70 percent of chemicals produced in high volume.
</P>
<P>
   Still, data that spring from company files and
industry-sponsored research inspire skepticism along with trust.
``This is an important step in the right direction, but we will
work with them closely to ensure that all the research is done with
the right checks and balances,'' said Carol Browner, the
administrator of environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are that it will be, said Kenneth Olden, director of the
National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences. Referring to
the industry's toxicology institute, Olden said, ``The CIIT has
always operated fairly and independently and it subjects its
research to the most rigorous peer review.''

 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a significant victory for Kenneth Starr, a
divided Federal appeals panel on Tuesday reinstated a tax fraud
case he had brought against Webster Hubbell, a longtime Arkansas
friend of President and Mrs. Clinton. The court majority said that
a lower-court judge was wrong when he threw out the case on grounds
that the independent counsel had overreached, essentially
conducting ``a fishing expedition.''
</P>
<P>
   The 2-1 ruling provides new leverage for Starr to press Hubbell
for information damaging to the Clintons, even though he has
insisted he has no such information. Starr has asserted in court
filings that Hubbell accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in
bogus consulting fees from Clinton's political supporters on which
he paid no taxes. Starr contended the payments were ``hush money''
meant to discourage him from disclosing what he knows about the
Clintons' financial dealings in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   In upholding Starr's right to bring the tax fraud case, the
United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
even affirmed the idea that the fees paid to Hubbell appeared, in
fact, to be hush money. ``The timing, sources and extent of the
payments make the belief that they were hush money reasonable,''
said the majority opinion written by Judge Stephen F. Williams, an
appointee of President Reagan, and joined by Judge Patricia M.
Wald, named to the bench by President Carter. Judge David S. Tatel,
appointed by President Clinton, dissented from that portion of the
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   But the appeals court also raised a possible obstacle to Starr
in prosecuting the tax case. In a separate 2-1 ruling with Wald and
Tatel in the majority, the panel raised questions about whether
Starr may build his tax case on documents he collected from Hubbell
under a grant of immunity.
</P>
<P>
   The court said the independent counsel must establish that it
did not rely on Hubbell's testimony to obtain the financial
documents that are a major part of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the ruling affords Starr some measure of legitimacy
in an area in which he had been widely criticized, that is whether
his investigation had improperly strayed far beyond his original
mandate of investigating Whitewater, the Arkansas land deal
involving the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell's case, in fact, had other repercussions. Some of the
fees he received that Starr said amounted to hush money were
arranged by Vernon Jordan, a close friend of the president. It was
Jordan's help in trying to find a job for Monica Lewinsky that
Starr cited in seeking permission to expand his investigation into
Clinton's relationship with the former intern.
</P>
<P>
   In dismissing the tax fraud case against Hubbell last July, U.S.
District Court Judge James Robertson reflected the criticism that
Starr had reached well beyond his mandate, calling the subpoena in
the tax fraud prosecution ``a quintessential fishing expedition.''
</P>
<P>
   But the majority on Tuesday said that it was reasonable to
relate the possibility that Hubbell accepted hush money to the
original scope of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If payments Hubbell received beginning in 1994 were indeed
hush money to secure Hubbell's silence vis-a-vis Whitewater, the
possible obstruction of justice therein would certainly be a crime
`relating to' Whitewater for it would be an attempt to cover up
wrongdoing afterward,'' the majority opinion said. The judges then
went on to criticize Robertson, saying that the Supreme Court has
upheld the constitutionality of the independent counsel law and
that ``it is not for lower court judges to undercut that decision
by constructions of the act that prevent this prosecutor from
performing his duty in a manner reasonably approximating that of an
ordinary prosecutor.''
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell was once the chief justice of the state of Arkansas, a
position to which he had been appointed by Clinton when he was that
state's governor. Later, Hubbell was the No. 3 official in the
Justice Department, but he was forced to resign in 1994 over a
messy billing dispute at his Arkansas law firm. The payments in
question came after Starr began investigating him.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's ruling also means that Hubbell, who has already served
a prison sentence on charges brought by the independent counsel,
now faces two additional trials on separate charges brought by
Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell spent nearly 17 months in prison after pleading guilty
to bilking his partners in the Little Rock, Ark., law firm at which
he once worked with Mrs. Clinton. But Starr failed to get from
Hubbell what he was really after: incriminating evidence about the
Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   Starr then brought the indictment for tax fraud that was
reinstated on Tuesday. Last November, Starr brought yet another
indictment against Hubbell, charging that he had concealed
information about the role he and Mrs. Clinton played in a
complicated land transaction in Arkansas that helped lead to the
collapse of a savings and loan association.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell has said that he does not know of wrongdoing on the part
of the Clintons and that ``nothing the independent counsel can do
to me is going to make me lie about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The tax fraud indictment that was reinstated on Tuesday accused
Hubbell; his wife, Suzanna; and two advisers, Michael Schaufele, an
accountant, and Charles C. Owen, a lawyer, of scheming over four
years to evade taxes and penalties on more than $850,000 in income.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment also charges that Hubbell made premature
withdrawals from an individual retirement account without paying
withholding taxes. In all, the indictment alleges that the Hubbells
owed nearly $900,000 in taxes to the federal government, the state
of Arkansas and the district of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing outside his Washington-area home Tuesday afternoon,
Hubbell said, ``We're innocent, not only myself but my wife and my
friends, of any of the underlying charges.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how much of an obstacle the second part of
Tuesday's ruling would prove for Starr. The appeals court said that
to use the financial documents to make his case, Starr must show
``reasonably particular knowledge'' of their existence before
Hubbell turned over more than 13,000 pages under a grant of
immunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should the independent counsel prove unable to meet the
requisite evidentiary burden, the contents of those documents will
be inadmissible,'' the court ruled. Charles Bakaly, a spokesman for
Starr, said on Tuesday that the office of independent counsel was
prepared to demonstrate it was entitled to use the financial
documents.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has said he knew about consulting payments Hubbell
received from the Riady family of Indonesia and the city of Los
Angeles. But the appeals panel said that ``these snippets of
information do not come close to establishing the existence of the
myriad of documents sought through the subpoena.''
</P>
<P>
   John W. Nields, Hubbell's lawyer, declined to say Tuesday night
whether he would appeal the latest ruling.

PROSECUTORS SEEK THREE WITNESSES AT CLINTON TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Frustrated House managers sought subpoenas Tuesday
for only ``a pitiful three'' witnesses, including Monica S.
Lewinsky, as the Senate's Republican majority moved toward
extending the impeachment trial of President Clinton, to the
outrage of his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The House team, abandoning hopes of calling as many as 15
witnesses, also asked the Senate to subpoena Clinton's friend,
Vernon E. Jordan Jr., and a senior White House aide, Sidney
Blumenthal, to bolster the case for removing the 42d president from
office.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprise twist, the House Republican managers also
``requested'' that Clinton submit to a deposition, which the White
House promptly rejected.
</P>
<P>
   The managers dropped their plan to subpoena Clinton's personal
secretary, Betty Currie, as they struggled to fashion a narrow
witness list that would satisfy a majority of senators.
</P>
<P>
   The developments unfolded as the Senate came close to polarizing
over the witness issue, threatening to shatter the fragile
bipartisanship of the proceedings. The events played out in
split-screen as some television networks showed both the Senate
proceedings and scenes from St. Louis, where Clinton met with Pope
John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   Facing back-to-back votes Wednesday, the Senate was poised to
defeat a Democratic-sponsored motion to dismiss the impeachment
charges and approve the request by House Republicans for witnesses,
according to members of both parties. Senators secretly debated the
issues for four hours Tuesday night in their second closed-door
deliberations of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Olympia J. Snowe, a Maine Republican, said after the
session that members of both parties are seeking a compromise to
avoid partisan votes Tuesday. Members of both parties said two
senators _ Sam Brownback, a Kansas Republican, and Tom Harkin, an
Iowa Democrat _ were working on a bipartisan plan for the next
phase of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's back on,'' Harkin said of cooperation between the
parties.
</P>
<P>
   After a long day of attacks and counterattacks, the private
session appeared to have fostered fresh concern for restoring
decorum and completing the trial under a compromise pact.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't want this to become perceived as being partisan,
so we're trying to find a way to avoid that,'' said Senator John F.
Kerry. ``Whether that's possible, we don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted 58-41 to keep Tuesday night's debate secret.
Kerry, who had voted to open the first session, took the opposite
position Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He issued a statement saying he voted to close the session ``in
order to respect and protect the privacy of the named witnesses and
the identity of potential witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   The movement toward approving the witness request marked a
pivotal shift among Senate Republicans, just two days after several
GOP senators predicted the trial could end as early as this week
without a witness phase.
</P>
<P>
   ``There clearly has been a dramatic change,'' said Senator Phil
Gramm, a Texas Republican, before the private deliberations. ``I
believe it is now certain we will have witnesses on the floor of
the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers and Senate Democrats warned that a witness
phase would prolong the trial for weeks, if not months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has a right to defend himself properly, which
means calling Linda Tripp, calling Ken Starr, showing the
unfairness, demonstrating the rest of his constitutional options,''
Kerry said, referring to Lewinsky's former friend, Linda R. Tripp,
and the independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the president's lawyers go the full distance under their
rights,'' Kerry said, ``we will be here for months.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans said they were persuaded during private
caucuses over the last two days to support a limited number of
witnesses out of fairness to the House managers.
</P>
<P>
   Many GOP members supported a plan by Senator John H. Chafee,
Republican of Rhode Island, to complete the depositions of
Lewinsky, Jordan, and Blumenthal by early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Under Chafee's plan, each witness would be questioned no longer
than two hours each by House managers and White House lawyers. One
senator from each party would observe the depositions, which would
be videotaped and provided to all senators for review.
</P>
<P>
   Before the discussions, Republican leaders said they expected
votes next week on whether any of the witnesses will testify before
the full Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Chafee predicted before the secret talks that the request by the
House managers for depositions would be approved and possibly
carried out under his plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that they have come down with so few witnesses is a
tremendous concession,'' Chafee said of the House managers. ``It
certainly pleases me, and I think it pleases most of the
Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Facing an extended trial, the Senate majority leader, Trent
Lott, Tuesday asked a group of GOP senators to examine a plan that
would end the proceeedings by dividing the charges into two parts:
During the final vote, senators would be allowed to find Clinton
guilty of the charges, but would then face a second vote on
removing him from office. ``It's still very much on track,'' said
Senator Ted Stevens, an Alaska Republican, although the White House
expresses strong opposition to the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the House managers were far from pleased to cast
aside a dozen potential witnesses to satisfy the Senate's political
concerns. ``We have narrowed it down to three, a pitiful three,''
Representative Henry J. Hyde, leader of the managers, said on the
Senate floor. ``And I should think you would want to proceed with
that minimal testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton faces two articles of impeachment alleging that he lied
under oath to a federal grand jury and obstructed justice to cover
up his sexual affair in the White House with Lewinsky, a former
intern. He faces four counts of lying under oath and seven counts
of obstruction.
</P>
<P>
   House managers, in a two-hour public presentation, vowed they
would not ask Lewinsky about details of her sexual liaisons with
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the managers said, they would question Lewinsky about
help she received from Clinton and Jordan to find a job in New
York, and about gifts Clinton gave Lewinsky that Currie later
collected. The House managers said they also would ask about an
affidavit Lewinsky filed in the sexual harassment lawsuit that
Paula Corbin Jones filed against Clinton and settled last year for
$850,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's one witness that you and the American people
honestly need to hear, it's Ms. Lewinsky,'' Representative Ed
Bryant of Tennessee told the Senate. ``Her testimony in particular
would be extraordinarily enlightening in resolving factual disputes
about the very charges for which we ask you to convict the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   As Bryant argued for Lewinsky's deposition, she was leaving a
Washington hotel for an unspecified location, with a police escort
to shield her from a media throng. Lewinsky had flown to Washington
on Saturday to comply with a court order to be interviewed by the
House managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her state of mind is, she wants to get out of town,'' said her
lawyer, Plato Cacheris. ``She's been cooped up in the hotel, she's
not able to leave, and she wants to get on with her life.''
</P>
<P>
   The House managers argued that Jordan should testify about his
role in helping find Lewinsky a job and that Blumenthal should be
questioned about a series of remarks that Clinton made about
Lewinsky last year after the scandal broke.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal has testified that Clinton described Lewinsky as a
``stalker'' who made sexual advances on him. The obstruction charge
alleges that Clinton concocted the story to induce Blumenthal to
testify falsely to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   On the Senate floor, Clinton's private lawyer, David E. Kendall,
argued that Clinton's comments to Blumenthal involved the
president's effort to avoid embarrassment by disclosing his affair
with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall argued that reams of sworn testimony gathered during
Starr's eight-month investigation of the Lewinsky matter was more
than the Senate needed to reach a verdict. ``The managers' case is
in no way hindered by being unable to call witnesses at this
point,'' Kendall said.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers also sought permission to introduce three new
pieces of evidence, including telephone records that cite a
56-minute call from Clinton to Lewinsky the day after lawyers in
the Jones case included Lewinsky on their witness list.
</P>
<P>
   Although many Senate Republicans reacted favorably to the House
requests, some of Clinton's key supporters lashed out. ``The motion
for witnesses is a motion for delay,'' said Senator Edward M.
Kennedy. ``The time to end the trial is now, and the correct number
of witnesses is zero.''

   BC-JORDAN-SUCCESSION-NYT (moved on Monday, Jan. 25)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Monday, Jan. 25,
about King Hussein's selection of his eldest son, Prince Abdullah,
as his successor misstated the adopted name of the King's second
wife, Toni Avril Gardiner. She was known as Princess Muna, not
Musa.
</P>
<P>
   Because of an editing error, the article misstated the site of
Deerfield Academy, where Prince Abdullah attended secondary school.
It is in Massachusetts, not Illinois.

</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Friday, Jan. 15,
about the effects of low oil prices on the Persian Gulf region
referred incorrectly to a standard unit of measurement. The barrel,
used throughout the world to measure crude oil and other oil
products, is defined as a volume of 42 gallons. It does not
correspond to any actual container, and has no relation to the
55-gallon steel drums that are widely used for shipping liquids.

EARTHQUAKE LEVELS COLOMBIAN CITY AS DEATH TOLL RISES 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ARMENIA, Colombia _ Bodies piled up at a makeshift morgue,
refugees huddled under plastic tarpaulins and ashen-faced survivors
inspected their crumpled homes Tuesday following the worst
earthquake to strike Colombia this century.
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude-6 quake struck Monday afternoon, wreaking havoc on
cities and villages in the fertile, coffee-growing mountains of
western Colombia. Interior Minister Nestor Martinez said Tuesday
night that at least 670 people were killed and 2,505 injured. Other
reports put the death toll at more than 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue workers have yet to pick through much of the debris, a
clean-up operation that could take months and an even higher death
toll. Hundreds of people were buried under the rubble. Some,
though, managed to get out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen so much desolation or damage,'' said
National Police Chief Rosso Jose Serrano, who toured the area
Tuesday with Colombian President Andres Pastrana.
</P>
<P>
   Armenia, a city of 250,000 about 100 miles west of the capital
of Bogota, was hardest hit. Some 15,000 houses were reported
destroyed here. The danger of cave-ins from ruined buildings was so
great that Mayor Alvaro Patino ordered the evacuation of the
central business district.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's Treasury Minister Juan Camilo Restrepo refused to put
a price tag on the damage but issued an urgent plea to the World
Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank for emergency
assistance to rebuild Armenia and other towns.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, France and Japan all dispatched excavation
experts to help in the rescue effort. The governments of Argentina,
Guatemala, Honduras and Spain also pledged their help.
</P>
<P>
   Shocked residents of Armenia roamed through the streets as the
stench of rotting corpses grew stronger in the scorching sun.
</P>
<P>
   At a university gymnasium, a red dump truck backed up to the
door. Workers, wearing plastic bags on their hands instead of
gloves, carried limp bodies past crowds of shrieking relatives.
Inside, the basketball court was covered with corpses awaiting
identification.
</P>
<P>
   Fabio Lopez, who leaned on his pickup in the gym parking lot,
couldn't stop crying. He was at work when the quake struck, and
dashed home.
</P>
<P>
   But in the rubble he couldn't distinguish which house was his.
When he asked a neighbor for help, his daughter, who was trapped
under bricks and boards, heard his voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was yelling. `Daddy! Daddy! I'm here! Down here! Lower!'''
Lopez recalled. ``No one had heard her. I dug her out, brick after
brick.''
</P>
<P>
   When Lopez reached his daughter, he discovered the lifeless body
of his 10-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   In the center of the city, a three-story fire station collapsed
into a mass of red bricks and twisted metal rods. Eight volunteer
firefighters and two cleaning women were crushed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's dead. We're trying to get at the last body,'' said
one worker, who was sweating from pounding at the concrete with a
crowbar.
</P>
<P>
   Others seemed to come back from the dead. Lilian Echeverry was
on the second floor of her house when the quake struck and ended up
on the first floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The staircase was on my legs,'' said Echeverry, who started
screaming and was eventually rescued.
</P>
<P>
   Armenia's main hospital was accepting only the worst cases.
Adriana Quintero, whose left hand was mangled when her house fell
down, was rejected by doctors Monday but tried again Tuesday as her
swollen fingers turned blue and yellow.
</P>
<P>
   The waiting room was jammed with moaning patients. Many wore
homemade splints of cardboard and tape. Outside, people on the
lookout for the missing frantically read through lists of admitted
patients posted on the hospital walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't find him,'' wailed Betty Mejia, who has no idea what
happened to her cousin.
</P>
<P>
   On the southern edge of the city, the working-class neighborhood
of La Brasilia looked like a demolition site. Where once there were
city blocks, now there are piles of rubble two stories high.
Three-inch-wide cracks split streets, and fallen electric poles
block them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, determined survivors returned Tuesday with hammers,
crowbars and shovels to salvage what they could. One man called
into the ruins for his dog. Another man gingerly removed his
amplifier, tape deck and speakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't tell where one house ends and the other begins,''
said Pedro Alberto Rojas, another homeless man.
</P>
<P>
   Lilian Echeverry mused that while her house was destroyed, her
Mazda 323 emerged from the garage with a shattered windshield, but
in working order. Urbina Serna saved his motorcycle from his ruined
bakery but lost his wife and two employees. He wore dark glasses to
hide his tears.
</P>
<P>
   Many moved in with relatives. Others erected tarpaulins and
tents in Armenia's parks and boulevards and lined up at hastily
erected soup kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very sad,'' said President Pastrana, following a tour
of Armenia. ``This is the most critical area.``
</P>
<P>
   City officials here warned that things could get worse. The
quake knocked out electricity and telephone service in the city,
and drinking-water supplies were running short. A strong aftershock
rocked the downtown Tuesday afternoon causing panic.
</P>
<P>
   Armenia's airport closed for commercial flights because it was
jammed with air force jets, helicopters, cargo planes running
relief missions. A 6 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew remained in effect to
prevent looting, but it also hindered rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Since most of the damage was in urban centers, it appeared that
plantations, roads and other infrastructure for Colombia's vital
coffee industry were largely unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the tragedy, Colombians pulled together to help
survivors. It momentarily took their minds off other national woes,
such as the nation's 35-year-old civil war, rising crime and a
stagnating economy.
</P>
<P>
   TV stations broadcast nonstop reports from the disaster zone,
newspapers published extra editions and radio stations spent much
of their time relaying on-air messages for victims. Banks opened
special accounts for donations and quickly received hundreds of
deposits.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need is the solidarity of the Colombian people and
international public opinion because the situation is very grave,''
said Serrano, the police chief.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's earthquake was the deadliest in Colombia since 1875,
when a quake killed 1,000 at Cucuta on the border with Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's last major natural disaster occurred in 1986 when a
volcanic eruption caused massive mudslides that buried the town of
Armero and killed 23,000.

NEW VOTES ENOUGH TO OK MLK HOLIDAY, GLOBE SURVEY SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ After years of notoriety as the only state
without an official holiday bearing the name of Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr., New Hampshire is poised to join the other 49 states in
honoring the slain civil rights leader.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Globe survey of all but one of 125 new voters,
there are now almost certainly enough votes to approve the holiday
in the House. Their votes will be crucial because returning
incumbents are evenly split on the issue. Supporters have 199 House
votes _ just two short of the 201 needed for passage. There are
about 30 undecided Republicans, three undecided Democrats, and one
Democrat who could not be reached. Further, key Republican backing
for the measure _ in a GOP-dominated House _ is beginning to
emerge.
</P>
<P>
   The state Senate approved a King holiday in 1997, when it was
controlled by Republicans. Now, with Democrats having seized the
majority in the last election, the current Senate is virtually
certain to approve it, too.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Jeanne Shaheen declared in her January inaugural speech
that New Hampshire must not enter the year 2000 without a day
honoring King by name.
</P>
<P>
   Honoring King would be another step in an evolutionary process
that has seen the state shedding the ultraconservative image that
has clung to it for more than 25 years. It is a process highlighted
not only by the election in 1996 of Shaheen, a Democrat and a
woman, to the governor's chair, but also by Democrats capturing the
Senate in the last election; the rise of women to positions of
power throughout state government; and the fact that people in both
parties are now discussing broadbase taxes _ in a state with no
sales or income taxes _ to address problems in school funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little older and a lot more tolerant,'' said
Representative David Young, an Acworth Republican who voted against
the bill in the past, but now says he supports it.
``African-Americans have made a determination'' about the
significance of Dr. King in the civil rights movement, said Young,
``and I've got to respect that.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, when Arizona adopted a King holiday, New Hampshire
has been the only state without a holiday in the civil rights
leader's honor. The first attempt to name a holiday for King in New
Hampshire came in 1979. That effort failed, as did repeated
attempts through the 1980s. In 1991, the state adopted Civil Rights
Day and, since 1993, governors have added King's name to the
holiday by proclamation.
</P>
<P>
   Passing this year's bill, which will probably be considered this
spring, will still take some care, according to those familiar with
the legislative process.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters must make sure that all 120 returning lawmakers who
voted for the bill last time do so again. Further, they must make
sure the 13 returning supporters who left the chamber before the
1997 vote _ when it lost by one vote, 178-177 _ stay and vote this
time.
</P>
<P>
   Accomplishing that, with 201 votes needed for passage in the
400-member House, means they must find 68 votes among the new batch
of lawmakers. That appears within easy reach.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Globe survey, 66 of the new lawmakers support
renaming the holiday. Only 39 of the new members oppose it.
Nineteen are undecided and one _ Somersworth Democrat Richard Hemon
_ could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Among the undecideds are three Democrats _ Michael J. Blaisdell
of Keene, Lucien Bergeron of Nashua, and James Phinizy of Acworth.
To win on the issue, supporters need to win the backing of two of
these three _ and only two Democrats in the survey said they were
against the measure _ or pick up a few Republican votes among the
other undecided newcomers or veterans. One Democratic backer said a
survey of Republicans shows those votes would be forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the measure this year appear divided into two
camps: those with lingering and absolute dislike for King, and
those who argue that no one person should have their name attached
to Civil Rights Day because no president has a day named after him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's race-based,'' Michael Gilman, a Littleton Republican,
said of the measure. ``If he had blond hair and blue eyes, you
don't think they'd be having a day for him, do you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot vote to honor a man who was a communist, who called
our soldiers baby-killers,'' said James Johnson, a Gilford
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Among proponents there are those, like Young, who think it is
time that after, what he calls years of meaningful independence and
debate, New Hampshire honor a national decision. There are those
who love King as much as others hate him. And there are those who
want his visage on the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so important for our kids to be able to put a face on
Civil Rights Day,'' said Donald Lent, a Durham Democrat. ``I
thought we lost something when we got Presidents' Day'' _ instead
of Washington's and Lincoln's birthdays.
</P>
<P>
   It would also be a vote that would help put a different face on
New Hampshire because it would erase some of the last vestiges of
perceptions of the state as a poor and rural place run by
arch-conservatives. Never mind that it is one of the wealthiest
states in the nation, that its southern tier is a booming economic
engine, and that the conservative wing of the Republican Party here
has marginalized itself, able to push the party into nominating
conservatives in the presidential primaries and gubernatorial
races, but failing recently to put up winners.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, conservatives are blamed for driving from the party a
host of moderates, particularly women, who became a key bloc in
Shaheen's ascendancy.
</P>
<P>
   If New Hampshire, through its vote on a King holiday, is to
continue its evolution, Representative Peter Burling, the House
minority leader, will have to play a strong role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not let happen what happened last time happen this
time,'' he vowed.

MOUSE UNLIKELY TO ROAR AS DISNEY EXPECTED TO REPORT POOR QUARTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Wall Street trackers following The Walt Disney
Co. are bracing for the entertainment giant to post one of its
worst quarters in memory due to continued poor performance at ABC
and home video operations.
</P>
<P>
   Disney, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, is
expected to report earnings before markets open today for its first
quarter ended Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to expect December quarter results to look ugly,''
said ING Barings Furman Selz analyst Stewart Halpern, who expected
per-share earnings to fall 38 percent to 23 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   First Call's recent survey of 15 analysts generated a mean
estimate of 24 cents a share. ``There are a lot of things still
impacting the company,'' said Edward Jones Co. analyst Linda
Bannister, who expects earnings of 24 or 25 cents a share due to
ABC's higher costs for pro football rights, declining ratings for
ABC programming and weakness in sales of Disney products in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Halpern predicts operating profit in broadcasting will fall 32
percent to $330 million due to higher costs and a 3 percent decline
in network ratings. He said creative content will decline 39
percent to $425 million because the quarter saw significant video
contributions only from ``Simba's Pride'' and because foreign
product sales will remain sluggish.
</P>
<P>
   Bannister noted strong results from ``A Bug's Life'' and ``The
Waterboy'' had been offset partly by a poor performance from
``Mighty Joe Young'' and splitting profits from ``A Bug's Life''
with Pixar Animation.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, Halpern said theme parks should post a 12
percent gain to $321 million due to Animal Kingdom's opening in
Florida and renovations at Disneyland's Tomorrowland.
</P>
<P>
   The report will follow downbeat results in the previous quarter,
when earnings fell 24 percent to $296 million, or 14 cents a share,
due to weak films such as ``Holy Man'' and ``Beloved,'' poor
foreign video performance and continuing problems at ABC. That
fiscal fourth quarter capped a year where profits fell 6 percent at
a company that had often posted year-to-year gains topping 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Disney stock has been bumped up recently by investor enthusiasm
over its launch of the Go.com portal site, which analysts believe
is worth an additional $6 a share. Shares closed Tuesday at
$34.4375, off 37.5 cents.

 &HT;    House Republicans resist Bush agenda
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr. and Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ With his enormous popularity and bipartisan
support, one might think the legislative process could be dispensed
with and Gov. George W. Bush's legislative proposals, to be laid
out in today's State of the State speech, simply put into action.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, say state lawmakers, including members of Bush's own
Republican party, who themselves have killed or watered down major
Bush legislative proposals in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bush's conservative credentials are being debated
nationally, conservatives in the Legislature say they believe that
even as he reaches out to more moderate factions that he is with
them. The question for Bush is whether conservatives will stay with
him as the details of his legislative agenda are hammered out.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, for example, a few conservative Republicans killed a
Bush-backed plan to make clear that eight-liner machines are
illegal. Some conservatives also refused to pass a massive tax cut
bill that Bush supported, though they did approve a scaled-back
plan to give tax breaks to property owners. ``I respect George Bush
to no end ... but the people of Senate (district) 10 didn't send me
here to automatically jump to any drummer's beat other than what I
believe is in their best interest and what they have communicated
to me,'' said Sen. Chris Harris, R-Arlington. ``I do not give up my
right to think.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris was among conservative Republicans who rejected the
larger, Bush-backed property tax cut. Harris said the bill raised
too many other taxes to pay for the property tax cut. ``It wasn't
needed,'' Harris said. Sen. Jane Nelson, R-Flower Mound, also
rejected the larger property tax plan. She said, however, that her
split with the Bush-backed plan was based on the issue, not
philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have consistently been ranked the most conservative
member,'' Sen. Jane Nelson, R-Flower Mound, said Tuesday. ``I sure
consider him a good solid conservative who reflects the interest of
most Texans.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush Spokeswoman Karen Hughes and conservatives in the
Legislature add that Bush faces no more threat from within his own
party than he faces from others in the political arena.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday evening remarks to the Texas Farm Bureau, Bush said
his speech today would key on taxpayers and schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we ought to share the surplus with the taxpayers of
Texas,'' he said. ``I'm going to propose substantial property tax
cuts...again.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would resist efforts to spend the entire surplus, a
move he said could take Texas toward a place it has resisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd certainly hate to be in a position where we put in all
kinds of new programs ... and wake up five to 10 years from now and
say, Oops, we don't have enough money, we need a personal income
tax,'' said Bush. ``I think that would be a disaster for Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor also will push his anti-social promotion plan. The
state, as a result of years of promoting kids who didn't earn it,
now has ``a pipeline full of illiterates'' in the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   On an issue of keen interest to social conservatives, Bush said
he backs Pampa Rep. Warren Chisum's bill that would ban homosexuals
from adopting children or serving as foster parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the first thing we ought to do in any placement is we
ought to be looking for heterosexual couples,'' he said. ``To have
a male and female in the household I think provides the proper role
models for children's future.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are positions that are winning the hearts of
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is a ``conservative with wide-ranging appeal,'' said Sen.
John Carona, R-Dallas. ``He's very committed to the principles he
believes in, having limited government, lowering taxes and
individual responsibility. But at the same time, he recognizes that
effective politics today means reaching out to all segments of our
community and listening to people of different views. That's what
has made Governor Bush so remarkably successful. He's true to his
party and his conservative beliefs, but at the same time he
acknowledges that we (must) build coalitions.''
</P>
<P>
   A key conservative issue that Bush is expected to discuss in his
speech is parental notification or consent before minors get
abortions. Chisum said Bush could be more strident on that issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I clearly think the governor would be in favor of parental
consent or notification or maybe both. He's got a couple of teenage
daughters _ you put yourself in those shoes and you absolutely want
to know what's happening in their lives and in their friends
lives,'' Chisum said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he needs to tell us where he's at, if this is a
priority to him. Parental consent, that is absolutely such a basic
issue. I'd love to see him on that bandwagon, and I suspect he is
on it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Florence Shapiro, R-Plano and head of the Senate Republican
Caucus, said she, too, wants Bush to touch on the issue, but
doesn't expect the governor to focus on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A State of the State is a speech that touches on many, many,
many issues,'' Shapiro said. ``Often times, if your issue is even
mentioned in the State of the State, it gives it credibility and an
elevation in the eyes of the other legislators.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Corona, ``His speech will be one that by design is
intended to reach out broadly to people of both political
parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bill Ratliff, R-Mount Pleasant, noting the wide range of
conservatives and moderates in the Republican Party, said, ``Nobody
can span the entire spectrum of the Republican Party. That would be
a superhuman feat.''
</P>
<P>
   Juan B. Elizondo Jr. and Scott S. Greenberger write for the
Austin American-Statesman, Austin, Texas.

<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ Lacey Sanchez was afraid to visit her dad and
scared to touch him. The sight of Frank Sanchez lying in the
hospital bed with tubes running through his body terrified her.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Frank Sanchez underwent his third brain surgery. The
left side of his face and much of the right side of his body were
paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't breathe and talk at the same time. He dragged his
right foot when he walked. He drooled. He couldn't sleep without
choking.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Sanchez, the 46-year-old father of a 3-year-old daughter
and 7-year-old son, a husband for 10 years and the baseball coach
at Pepperdine University, could not swallow.
</P>
<P>
   But he knew he would.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't start screaming. I didn't start yelling,'' he said.
``I didn't go through the `Why Me?' I figured, `Let's regroup.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez has.
</P>
<P>
   Obstacles remain; he still suffers facial paralysis and he
chokes periodically. But some baseball normalcy has returned _ he
helps with watering and dragging the Pepperdine infield, and once
he starts pulling weeds, he can't stop.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, he is leading his Waves in their season opener
at home against Nevada on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a pretty sight now, but I'm light years better,'' he
said. ``There comes a time when many of us are down and out. You
have to battle.'' &UR;  &QL; 
Preparing for the worst &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez has had a benign brain tumor since 1984. His previous
surgeries, in 1985 and 1990, failed to remove the tumor, so it
continued to grow. Doctors told him he needed the third surgery
last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no choice,'' he said. ``You try to prepare without
thinking negatively. I made sure my life insurance was squared
away. You don't know how it will come out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to run with the kids, play with the kids and walk the
dog. I told them, `Daddy's going to be sick for a while.' I tried
to prep them.''
</P>
<P>
   Before each operation, doctors warned Sanchez and his wife April
of the possible complications, yet the first two surgeries resulted
in nerve damage so minor it was hardly noticeable.
</P>
<P>
   The third surgery, performed Aug. 17 at USC University Hospital,
lasted 11 hours and appeared to end like the others.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez remembered awakening in the recovery room being able to
blink, swallow and hear. He even propped his head up and said to an
attendant, ``Can you give me something for my head?''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty minutes later (his doctors told him afterward), he awoke
again, but in an intensive care unit. He knew something was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, plenty was wrong. The swallowing reflex, which every
healthy baby has at birth, was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first instant, I remember trying to assess my state of
being,'' he said. ``I figured out what my quality of life will
be.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't going to be great.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was devastating to see this strong, physical, athletic man
reduced to that,'' April said. ``I cried a lot, tears of
uncertainty and sadness.''
</P>
<P>
   In the hospital, after Frank began rehabilitation, April saw an
old man sitting in a wheelchair sleeping. Then she walked into her
husband's room and saw the same scene. &UR;  &QL; 
Facing a new crisis &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   April expected this surgery to end like the others, and she
planned to take off just a week from her job as a Valencia
elementary school teacher.
</P>
<P>
   She was emotionally shaken, but Frank never wavered in his
belief he would, eventually, recover. He left rehab after about 10
days, on Sept. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Sanchez still could not swallow and, finally, sought an
experimental treatment in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment center, operating since 1995 out of Mayfield
Heights Community Hospital, deals with patients suffering from a
variety of illnesses, including strokes, Parkinson's, ALS and
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not exactly the kind of stuff that happened on `Marcus
Welby,''' said Marcy Freed, one of the founders and speech
therapists at Mayfield Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Freed said Sanchez was a typical case.
</P>
<P>
   Each day for the approximately two weeks he was there as an
outpatient, Sanchez received electrical stimulation in the throat
to strengthen the muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Twice a week, Sanchez had a 3-foot long and 2-inch wide garden
hose-like tube put down his throat, then pulled up after a minute.
Freed said Sanchez couldn't swallow because a sphincter muscle in
the back of his throat didn't open and close. The insertions
stretch the muscle and allow it to open and close normally.
</P>
<P>
   Patients usually take anesthesia, but Sanchez couldn't. Earlier,
when Sanchez had his stomach tube removed, his heart stopped. Freed
said doctors feared the anesthetic would stop his heart again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a fun thing,'' Freed said, ``but for the minute of
traumatization, it's worth it. He had to do all of them (without
medication), and let me tell you something: That takes guts. It
tells you how badly he wanted to swallow.'' &UR;  &QL; 
Returning to the field &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Sanchez could drink.
</P>
<P>
   It was Oct. 20. Sanchez came home and returned to work, little
more than two months after his surgery and having missed just two
weeks of fall practice.
</P>
<P>
   Friends who visited Sanchez were amazed at his condition, but
not surprised by his progress.
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Mike Gillespie, who had Sanchez as his assistant from
1985-95, said he couldn't imagine anyone returning to work just two
months after such serious surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he has faced it, (it's) never an `Oh, poor me'
attitude,'' Gillespie said. ``He's been remarkable in the way he
has not allowed this to defeat him.''
</P>
<P>
   The first time his players saw him, they were shocked at
Sanchez's appearance. Dan Bir, the Waves' starting right fielder,
said it broke his heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see him in the condition he was in, it was tough,'' Bir
said.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Mike Kramer said he didn't think there was any way
Sanchez could come back. The baseball team had to be the least of
his worries.
</P>
<P>
   So to have Sanchez in the dugout Friday is, as pitcher Brad
Tucker said, ``Courageous, inspirational, all those type of
words.''
</P>
<P>
   Bir knows. He broke a bone in his left hand in the last
summer-league game. At first, he was upset at the prospects of
missing fall ball and starting the season out of shape. Then his
father reminded him of Sanchez's battle.
</P>
<P>
   Bir woke up and tackled rehabilitation with new gusto. He is
expected to start on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember his first day back. He told us of how he'd take the
extra step,'' Bir said. ``So I did it, too. I'd do the extra rep or
put on some extra weight.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez continues to recover slowly. He has regained four
pounds. Choking episodes aren't as intense. His children don't fear
him. His wife teases him when he wobbles around the house.
</P>
<P>
   The latest and best news came in December. An MRI exam revealed
the possibility doctors removed the entire tumor. Sanchez said he
has never seen his neurosurgeon that excited.
</P>
<P>
   But after three surgeries, the Sanchezes prefer to wait before
they join that excitement. Another MRI is scheduled for June.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very hopeful,'' April said, ``but we've been told it
wouldn't bother him for a long time, so we're cautious.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank added: ``I'm saying my prayers that they got it all. If
not, then you've got to prepare.''

 &HT;    A wrangling jury selection for King murder trial
 &HT;    By Denise Gamino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Many were called, but few are being chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors in Jasper County earn $15 a day, but even in a county
with a 12 percent unemployment rate _ more than double the 5
percent statewide average _ the jury job is proving hard to fill
for the most notorious murder trial in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, seven of the first 10 people interviewed to sit in
judgment of a white man accused of fatally dragging a black man
behind a pickup were sent home. Most opposed the death penalty, but
one man revealed that the accused killer sent his
step-granddaughter letters from prison that tout white supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called her his little Aryan princess,'' Donald Halmon said
after being disqualified for admitting he believes John William
``Bill'' King is guilty of killing James Byrd Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Jury duty notices were sent to 400 residents of this Piney Woods
county near the Louisiana border. But even before jury selection
began this week, nearly 185 people claimed medical conditions or
other personal situations that exempted them from service.
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge Joe Bob Golden, concerned about possible
shirkers, required a doctor's note from any prospective juror who
claimed that a medical condition would prevent jury duty. Even a
pregnant woman whose baby is due next week had to submit
verification.
</P>
<P>
   The notoriety of the case has made many prospective jurors
uneasy. They realize the world will be watching what, if any,
punishment Jasper gives to the man who allegedly masterminded the
unthinkable hate crime that killed Byrd on June 7, a crime that
brought the Ku Klux Klan and gun-toting New Black Panthers to
Jasper to protest last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Many people here believe the KKK and the black militants may
bring their hate-filled demonstrations to Jasper again, depending
on the outcome of King's murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, we don't have a problem getting enough people to
serve on a jury here,'' said Jasper County Judge Joe Folk.
</P>
<P>
   In the economically depressed Jasper area, heavily hit by a
slumping timber market, the $15-a-day job of juror should look good
to people, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looks like anybody would want to work for that,'' the judge
said.
</P>
<P>
   To help put jurors at ease, the Jasper County sheriff's office
promises to provide personal escorts to and from the courthouse
each day of the trial. The escorts will protect the 12 jurors and
two alternate jurors from contact with the media, which has been
forbidden by the judge from releasing juror names or photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors and defense attorneys for King are taking a close
look at the personal backgrounds of prospective jurors. On Monday,
they gave detailed questionnaires to the 122 people who qualified
for the jury after the first elimination round of opening
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers want to know the last book read, the last movie viewed,
messages on bumper stickers, which three people the prospective
jurors most admire and what is the most important value a parent
can teach a child.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney C. Haden ``Sonny'' Cribbs Jr. is looking for
jurors who are independent thinkers, people who may be willing to
hold out for a life sentence rather than the death penalty if they
find King guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want somebody who is not a follower,'' Cribbs said.
</P>
<P>
   King denies he killed Byrd, and blames the black man's death on
Shawn Allen Berry, who owned the pickup that dragged Byrd until he
was decapitated. Berry and Lawrence Russell Brewer also have been
charged in Byrd's death, but have no trial date.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray is looking for
jurors who are educated and hold professional jobs, including at
least two blacks so that the jury will mirror the county's 20
percent black population.
</P>
<P>
   He wants jurors who can understand complex DNA evidence because
authorities plan to introduce evidence of blood on King's shoes.
</P>
<P>
   And he believes educated professionals are more outraged over
Byrd's death than others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It offends anybody, but it tends to offend professional,
educated people maybe a little more,'' Gray said. ``The
professional, educated people tend to be a little more liberal than
the general population and this type of offense offends liberals a
little more than it does conservatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Individual jury interviews will be conducted all week. If too
many people continue to say they oppose the death penalty or that
they have made up their mind that King is guilty, lawyers may have
to begin drawing people from two upcoming county jury pools.
</P>

TO THOSE WHO KNEW HIM THEN, REEVES IS A NEW MAN  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ After Dan Reeves left the Giants, he went through an
evolution ... wait. Check that. Don't use the ``e'' word around
players who were with Reeves when he was coach of the Giants from
1993 to 1996 and migrated with him to Atlanta. Do so, and a harsh
stare will come your way.
</P>
<P>
   These players believe there is no new Dan. No transformation. No
sudden spark of offensive genius. His supporters say the man who
ran a Giants offense described as archaic by the former Giants wide
receiver Mike Sherrard _ ``like a Big Ten offense,'' he said _ ran
the same plays then that he does now with the high-scoring Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   The coach who kept John Elway bottled up like a well-kept secret
for years in Denver, akin to putting a race horse behind a plow,
according to Broncos tight end Shannon Sharpe, is the same person
who now gives quarterback Chris Chandler freedom to call audibles
at the line of scrimmage and throw deep downfield.
</P>
<P>
   For those who followed Reeves closely when he was the Giants'
coach, he simply looks like a different man. No longer involved in
skirmishes with the front office, he looks happier. No longer
saddled with what he always thought were average players _ at best
_ the Falcons have reached Super Bowl XXXIII.
</P>
<P>
   They have done so with one of the most potent offenses in
football. Jamal Anderson rushed for a National Football
Conference-best 1,846 yards, Chandler passed for 3,154 yards and in
his past six games has a quarterback rating of 118, and the
Falcons' two starting wide receivers, Tony Martin and Terance
Mathis, caught passes for more than 1,000 yards each.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves runs this offense? The same Reeves who commanded several
of the worst offenses in football from 1994 until he was fired
after the 1996 season? The same Reeves who ran the ball on first,
second and third downs? Believe it, say former Giants players now
with him in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The reason Reeves lost with the Giants, they say, is because of
bad players at key positions, no team speed and an overall lack of
toughness.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, and I know it won't be popular in New York, but
to me Dan is the same coach,'' said Gary Downs, a backup running
back for the Falcons who played for the Giants in 1994 and 1996.
``It is just that now he has total control. He can bring in the
players he wants, run his system. In New York, someone else chose
the players, and sometimes they didn't go a very good job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The personnel we have now allows him to do different things.
We had no speed in New York, now we have wideouts who can fly. I
disagree that the offense here is more wide open. The same plays
are being called, we didn't have the guys in New York that could
play, and we had a quarterback who couldn't throw deep.''
</P>
<P>
   That last comment seemed to be a shot at the former Giants
quarterback Dave Brown, who often feuded with Reeves. Some players
thought that Brown never had support from Reeves and that Reeves
was an unimaginative play-caller. Others felt that Brown was simply
a poor quarterback _ he had a 69.3 quarterback rating with the
Giants _ and that Reeves ran a conservative offense because he had
to.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of Reeves as an ultraconservative coach was not born in
New York. Sharpe said Tuesday that if Denver Coach Mike Shanahan,
considered one of the best innovators of the last 10 years, had
coached the Broncos instead of Reeves, Elway would own every
National Football League passing record.
</P>
<P>
   That is not true, maintain Reeves' Falcons players, especially
those with Giants backgrounds. ``I don't know what happened in
Denver, but I know that Dan was a great coach in New York, and he
is a great coach now,'' said Falcons tight end Brian Kozlowski, who
played for Reeves from 1994 to 1996. ``This is his fourth Super
Bowl. How bad a coach could he have been in Denver or New York or
anywhere?''
</P>
<P>
   Downs gave an example of how Reeves has not changed since the
Giants. Two running plays used in Atlanta are identical to ones
they ran in New York, called ``94 outside'' and ``34 big.'' In New
York, the plays were for Rodney Hampton, the Giants' leading career
rusher. In Atlanta, they are run by Anderson, who in addition to
possessing great power _ he can squat 600 pounds _ has good
quickness. He can zig when his linemen zag, cutting against the
grain to find an open spot.
</P>
<P>
   Downs said that Hampton was a great back but often failed to
break long gains because he would simply run straight ahead and
follow his blockers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rodney was good,'' Downs said, ``but Jamal is like Barry
Sanders. That's what I mean. Run the same plays with one guy, you
get one set of results. Run the same plays with a Jamal, and you
get a whole different result.''
</P>
<P>
   Downs added that another problem was that too many Giants
players lacked toughness.
</P>
<P>
   ``On this team, we have guys like Chuck Smith, who says before a
game, `Let's go hit somebody. Let's give it everything,''' Downs
said. ``We didn't have that in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Was Downs saying the Giants were soft?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say that, but their players then weren't like
our guys,'' he said. ``They weren't tough all the time, I'll just
say that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Reeves has evolved ... uh oh, there is that word
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about Dan,'' Kozlowski said, ``is that now, unlike
in New York, he has a lot of great players to work with.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Republican leaders on Tuesday took the
gamble that they can open the door to witnesses and still bring the
trial of President Clinton to a relatively quick, dignified and
civil conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and his deputies
have struggled to find a footing in the midst of powerful political
crosscurrents: the general public overwhelmingly wants the
impeachment drive to end, but the party's conservative base demands
that it move forward.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans have wondered just what loyalty they owe to
their colleagues in the House, who pulled them over the cliff once
before during the government shutdown of 1995-1996. And they wonder
what kind of precedents they are creating for history.
</P>
<P>
   With all these conflicting impulses in mind, Lott has now
arranged a middle ground for his party: to approve subpoenas for
just three witnesses to be desposed; sharply limit the questioning
time to just hours a witness, and arrive at an end to the trial by
mid-February at the latest. Although some Republicans were still
wavering, Lott seemed almost certain to win when the Senate votes
on Wednesday on whether to depose witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just trying to have a fair process here,'' the
Mississippi Republican said this week, ``but one that gets us to a
conclusion, as soon as possible, without rushing to judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott has been navigating his way through a caucus of many views,
not always following predictable ideological predilections.
Republicans say that conservatives senators like Don Nickles of
Oklahoma, the majority whip, or others who are former House
members, like James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, Wayne Allard of Colorado
and Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, have pushed to support the House
with a full trial and as many witnesses as the prosecutors wanted.
</P>
<P>
   But moderate senators like Susan M. Collins of Maine and John H.
Chafee of Rhode Island have also argued for witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama, a usual ally of Lott, has been
one of the Republicans most skeptical about witnesses. And Sen.
Richard Lugar of Indiana, usually a centrist, has been mostly quiet
in caucus, Republicans say, but sounded fierce on Tuesday when he
blamed the White House for any partisanship developing in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The White House has stonewalled almost every opportunity to
inquire about the president's activities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To hold this group together and win a majority for witnesses,
Lott has steadily reined in the House prosecutors. They once wanted
to call 15 witnesses instead of the three they ultimately settled
for on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He thus has played almost the opposite role as the leadership in
the House. There Rep. Tom DeLay, the majority whip, aggressively
pushed impeachment forward, by cleverly pushing moderates to vote
for impeachment, by not allowing them an easy out through a censure
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   The House prosecutors made it clear on Tuesday they were less
than delighted. ``We have always believed and we still do believe
that 10 or 12 witnesses are what we should have, and should have
been permitted to call to prove our case,'' Rep. Bill McCollum,
R-Fla., said.
</P>
<P>
   But Lott's efforts seemed to have turned the tide on witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, many Republicans were saying the Senate could
very well decide on Wednesday to block witnesses, with six or more
Republicans voting with the Democrats. On Tuesday, by contrast,
they seemed much more certain that witnesses will be approved when
the crucial vote arrives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow we will vote in favor of deposing witnesses,'' Sen.
Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said confidently. ``And in doing so we will
reinforce the ancient precedents of constitutional impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   So the vote will satisfy those Republicans who believe it would
set a dangerous constitutional precedent to cut off the impeachment
trial and those still trying to decide whether Clinton did obstruct
justice and commit perjury. It keeps the party's conservative base
from charging that the Senate just dismissed the case. It keeps
working relations between the House and Senate majorities. And if
everything goes according to plan, the trial will end by
mid-February.
</P>
<P>
   But there are political risks for Republicans as well. Even
though they are reining in their House counterparts, Senate
Republicans will still be voting to prolong a trial that most
Americans want to see end. A poll taken by the Gallup organization
for CNN and USA Today last weekend found that two-thirds of
Americans believed the Senate should go directly to a final vote on
impeachment without hearing from witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The votes on Wednesday threaten once again to mark the
Republicans as the party of impeachment. If all goes as predicted,
the day is expected to bring what Senate Republicans had once hoped
to avoid: near party-line votes, as the Republicans first defeat a
Demoratic effort to outright dismiss the case against the president
and then most likely approve witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of the votes would be minimized if, as looked
possible Tuesday night, the Republicans and Democrats could still
agree on the plan to proceed with depositions and then end the
trial quickly. ``Even a partisan vote tomorrow I don't think will
necessarily be a breakdown into partisanship,'' said Sen. Tim
Hutchinson, R-Ark. ``At that point it might actually be the
catalyst for discussions to go on that would bring it to a rapid
conclusion.'' But if the talks break down, there is also the
possibility of partisan warfare. Before the two parties began
negotiating Tuesday night, Sen. Tom Daschle, the minority leader,
and the White House warned in increasingly strident tones that once
depositions are allowed, the trial will inevitably spiral out of
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our colleagues need to clearly understand that if it's a
choice between expeditious and fair,'' Daschle said, ``Democrats
are going to fall on the side of fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   And David Kendall, Clinton's private lawyer, warned the Senate
of a long legal process ahead ``if the genie of discovery is let
out of the bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are several ways this trial could yet be extended. As
the rules now stand, the Senate can take individual votes after
depositions on whether it wants to call Monica Lewinsky or any
other witness to testify in the chamber.

<P>
   The Republicans are hoping that the White House's veiled threats
of a prolonged trial are empty. ``They'd be nuts to carry this
thing on,'' said Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah. ``That was a big
bluff.''

EXCERPTS FROM U.N. REPORT ON IRAQI DISARMAMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (See IRAQ-U.N.) 
(bl) 
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Following are excerpts of a report by the U.N.
Special Commission for disarming Iraq, distributed among Security
Council members.
</P>
<P>
   Concealment Policy
</P>
<P>
   Immediately following the gulf war the Iraqi presidency
collected reports on weapons remaining with Iraq's Armed Forces,
including its weapons prohibited by recently adopted resolution 687
(1991). Such documents were given to the presidency in the spring
of 1991. A decision was taken by a high-level committee (one of
whose members was Deputy Prime Minister Mr. Tariq Aziz) to provide
to the commission only a portion of its proscribed weapons, their
components and production capabilities and stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The policy, as deduced from a range of evidence available to the
commission, including the initial false Iraqi declarations, was
based on the following Iraqi actions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Provide only a portion of their extant weapon stocks, with an
emphasis on the least modern.
</P>
<P>
   _ Retain production capability and the `know how' documentation
necessary to revive programs when possible.
</P>
<P>
   _ Conceal the full extent of chemical weapons programs,
including its VX project, and retain production equipment and raw
materials.
</P>
<P>
   _ Conceal the number and type of BW and CW warheads for
proscribed missiles.
</P>
<P>
   _ Conceal indigenous long-range missile production capabilities,
specifically with respect top guidance systems and missile engines.
</P>
<P>
   _ Conceal the very existence of its offensive biological weapons
program and retain all production capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1998 there remained significant uncertainties in
the disposition of Iraq's prohibited programs.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has recently received information from multiple
sources identifying organizations that direct and implement the
Iraqi concealment effort. While the information from these sources
differs in some minor details, it agrees on several major points:
</P>
<P>
   _ The highest level of concealment-related decisions are made by
a small committee of high-ranking officials. The Presidential
Secretary, Abed Hamid Mahmoud, chairs this committee.
</P>
<P>
   _ The committee directs the activities of a unit which is
responsible for moving, hiding and securing the items proscribed by
the Commission.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Special Security Organization plays a key role in the
operation of this unit and in the tracking and surveillance of
commission activities.
</P>
<P>
   Biological Weapons
</P>
<P>
   Iraq claims to have produced, filled, deployed and unilaterally
destroyed 25 al-Hussein missile warheads intended for biological
weapons (BW) use. No evidence exists to confirm the number of
warheads produced as 25. Confusion reigns, even among Iraqi
officials, over how many warheads were filled with BW agents. There
is no evidence of the exact contents of the warheads. At al-Nibai
the numbers and whereabouts of remnants of stainless-steel warhead
agent containers, some of which have traces of Bacillus anthacis
spores, contradict the account of the weapons destruction in the
FFCD (Full, Final and Complete Disclosure).
</P>
<P>
   The FFCD states that 200 R-400 aerial bombs were manufactured
for the BW program and that 157 of these were filled with BW
agents, then deployed and unilaterally destroyed. The evidence
available indicates that more than 200 were available for the BW
program. The Iraqis admit that they are guessing as to the number
of and contents of the filled bombs. The physical evidence from the
remnants accounts for less than one-third of the bombs said to have
been unilaterally destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   From November 1990 until the cease-fire in 1991, Iraq worked to
produce a system able to deliver large volumes of BW agent aerosol
from high-performance aircraft. ...
</P>
<P>
   Besides the weapons that reached the production stage, Iraq
experimented with several other potential delivery systems;
122-millimeter rocket warheads were extensively trialed with BW
agent. Iraq claims to have abandoned this research. Iraq first
admitted that cluster munitions were part of the BW program, but
later withdrew that statement.
</P>
<P>
   Artillery shells filled with ricin were trialed. The LD-250
aerial bombs made by al-Muthanna and used in early BW trials were
abandoned in favor of the more robust R-400, according to Iraq.
Iraq investigated the use of gas gangrene. ...
</P>
<P>
   The amount of agent produced and declared by Iraq is
unsubstantiated. Quantities far greater than those declared could
have been easily produced. To complicate this situation even
further, there are no records of storage, filling into munitions,
or destruction.

OFFICIALS AWAIT AUTOPSY IN DEATH OF BABY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOIS R. SHEA AND KELLY WINGET  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANAAN, N.H. _ A newborn baby found dead last week in the room
of her teenage mother was apparently born alive, and authorities
continue to investigate whether to bring charges against the
17-year-old mother.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps groggy from the rigors of birth, the young mother may
have wrapped the infant, placed it under the bed, and then either
fell asleep or collapsed, The Globe has learned. The baby girl was
found dead the next morning. It is not known whether the mother
realized the baby was ever alive.
</P>
<P>
   The identity of the mother, a Mascoma Valley Regional High
School student, has not been released by authorities. They
emphasize that they are still investigating the case.
</P>
<P>
   Results of an autopsy are to be released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of the mother said that she either hid her pregnancy or
was unaware that she was expecting a baby.
</P>
<P>
   At 6 a.m. last Thursday, police responded to a call from a
Canaan home reporting a baby believed to be stillborn, said
Sergeant Tim Cohen of the Canaan police. Authorities said the young
woman was staying with her boyfriend's family.
</P>
<P>
   Three officers and an ambulance crew were dispatched to the
home, where the apparently full-term baby was pronounced dead at
the scene, according to Canaan Police Chief Tony Piscopo.
</P>
<P>
   The death of the child was ruled suspicious, as is done in all
cases where the cause is not immediately clear.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire Attorney General Philip T. McLaughlin said
authorities are ``continuing to investigate and trying to make an
assessment'' of whether the teenager knew the baby was alive when
it was born.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin said he does not know if the girl went to sleep after
giving birth, or simply collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you that the child was found by a woman in the
morning who lived there, and the circumstances of the child being
found and the condition of the child are causing us to look
carefully to see if we can determine what actually happened,''
McLaughlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Chelsie Fellows, 15, of Canaan, said the young mother had
complained of stomach pains, ``but no one really thought anything
of it because she told people she was trying to gain weight because
she was too skinny.''
</P>
<P>
   Fellows said the girl apparently kept her secret from everyone,
including her boyfriend's parents. ``I can't picture what it was
like for her,'' Fellows said.
</P>
<P>
   Friends said the girl and her mother moved north from Louisiana
five years ago, and that she has talked about wanting to become a
model. The girl had been dating her boyfriend for about a year,
friends said.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin said the boyfriend's family has been ``very
cooperative'' with authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a young woman who appears in many respects to have
been very much on her own,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin said he hopes to decide later this week whether
criminal charges are appropriate.

COMPAQ TO SELL SMALL STAKE IN ALTA VISTA SEARCH SITE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (lb) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Compaq Computer Corp. said Tuesday that it would sell a minority
stake in its Alta Vista service to the public as part of an effort
to build a leading player in advertising and shopping on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes just days after extended negotiations
between Compaq and Time Warner Inc. collapsed, according to
executives familiar with the talks. Time Warner was going to
exchange its extensive Internet operations, including sites linked
to its magazines, CNN and Warner Bros. entertainment properties, in
return for a big stake in Alta Vista, the people said.
</P>
<P>
   The talks ended because, among other reasons, Time Warner was
not willing to cede Compaq any control over its news and
entertainment content, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Eckhard Pfeiffer, Compaq's chief executive, said in an interview
Tuesday that Compaq now wants to control its own Internet strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we dug into the capabilities of Alta Vista, we concluded
that rather than give away the tremendous opportunity we had, we
would make the leap into the Internet space in a much broader way
than we have until now,'' he said. ``We intend to be among the top
three leaders in the industry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Alta Vista had mainly been known for its vast index
that allowed people to search millions of pages on the Internet to
find a specific word or phrase. It was started mainly to be a
demonstration of Internet technology by Digital Equipment Corp.,
which Compaq bought last year.
</P>
<P>
   As the stock-market valuations of Internet companies have surged
in recent months, Compaq has realized that Alta Vista may well have
been one of Digital's unappreciated crown jewels.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq will establish Alta Vista as an independent company based
in Palo Alto, Calif. It will be run by Rod Schrock, the executive
who introduced Compaq's Presario line of consumer personal
computers, which are now the sales leaders in their class.
</P>
<P>
   The company hopes the stock offering will be in the second half
of this year or early next year, Pfeiffer said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that in today's market, an offering could value
Alta Vista at between $1 billion and $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq said it wanted Alta Vista to expand from merely a search
service to resemble what have come to be known as portal sites
because they are doorways to everything from news to chat rooms to
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   To flesh out Alta Vista's offering, Compaq had been upgrading
the site with more features and had also engaged in a flurry of
deal making.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Compaq agreed to buy Shopping.Com, an Internet
retailer that had been plagued by accounting irregularities and
management changes. While its sales have been small, Shopping.com
has links to suppliers to offer a very wide range of products from
doghouses to disk drives.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Compaq said it would offer electronic mail on the
site using software based on Microsoft's Hotmail service. It will
also use Microsoft's chat software when it is released this spring.
In exchange, Compaq will allow Microsoft to use Alta Vista
technology to provide Internet searches on its MSN Web site. (Now
Microsoft has been paying another search company, Inktomi, to
operate its search service.)
</P>
<P>
   And Compaq is looking to replace the abandoned Time Warner deal
with another arrangement with a media company, which could provide
information content, perhaps in return for a partial stake in Alta
Vista, Pfeiffer said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Alta Vista faces stiff competition in the portal business. The
leaders are Yahoo and America Online, which has recently bolstered
its presence on the World Wide Web with an agreement to buy
Netscape Communications Corp. Other aspirants include Microsoft's
MSN network, Walt Disney Co.'s Go Network, and Excite, which
recently agreed to be bought by At Home.
</P>
<P>
   And analysts said they do not yet see how Alta Vista will rise
above the pack.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hard part is to give people something better than they
already have,'' said Paul Noglows, an analyst with Hambrecht &AMP;
Quist.

COMING APART, AS AN ART FORM  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 31) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass.)   Matt Wolf is the London Theater critic for Variety and a regular
writer on the arts from Europe  
 (af)  
 By MATT WOLF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The woman looks at the man who may or may not be her
son and asks: ``T b k k k k l?''
</P>
<P>
   That sequence of letters is the penultimate line of ``Blue
Kettle,'' the second of two one-act plays by Caryl Churchill that
make up her double bill ``Blue Heart.'' And the reply _ ``B.K.'' _
prompted by the question is no more immediately clear.
</P>
<P>
   So it fell to the playwright's longtime director, Max
Stafford-Clark, and a game company of actors, two of whom are in
their 80s, to make lucid what is encoded on the page. (In context,
``B.K.'' means ``Yes, please.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue Heart'' was widely acclaimed in its London debut nearly
18 months ago at the Royal Court Theater, where critics praised an
ever-adventurous dramatist _ perhaps Britain's most consistently
daring _ as well as a cast that illuminated fully what in lesser
hands might have come across as a stunt.
</P>
<P>
   The double-bill made its American debut on Friday at the
Brooklyn Academy of Music's Majestic Theater, following an
international tour last year. The stops by Stafford-Clark's Out of
Joint company included Estonia, Israel and Germany, among other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The engagement ends on Feb. 21 at the theater where, two years
ago, Stafford-Clark brought his Out of Joint production of ``The
Steward of Christendom'' by the Irish playwright Sebastian Barry.
``Blue Heart'' will play a final week at City Stage in Springfield,
Mass., from Feb. 24 to 28, as part of the Massachusetts
International Festival of the Arts.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Churchill, 60, declined to discuss her two recent one-acts,
beyond having described them earlier as ``just talking plays.''
This was to set them apart from such collaborative mixed-media
pieces as ``A Mouthful of Birds,'' ``Lives of the Great Poisoners''
and ``The Skriker,'' all of which incorporate music and/or dance in
various ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Skriker,'' seen in New York in 1996 at the Joseph Papp
Public Theater, also involved the manipulation of words. Ben
Brantley, writing in The New York Times, called the play
astonishing and described it as a toxic, urban variation on ``A
Midsummer Night's Dream'' in which even language appeared to be
mutating and dissolving. The title character, a shape-shifting
otherworldly creature, delivered a monologue ``poised between Joyce
and Beckett,'' Brantley said.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Blue Heart,'' Ms. Churchill seems to stretch and bend
language further. And yet the two one-acts can hold their own among
``Cloud Nine'' (1980), ``Top Girls'' (1982), ``Serious Money''
(1987), ``Mad Forest'' (1990), or any of the half-dozen or so works
with which Ms. Churchill, a fierce social critic and taker of
theatrical risks, has made a formidable reputation on both sides of
the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Heart's Desire,'' the opening play of the double bill, the
stop-and-start structure toys with form itself, fracturing a
narrative in ways both comic and frightening. The situation
involves a daughter's return from Australia to her anxious English
family, with husband and wife debating whether they should have met
the plane. Meanwhile, Aunt Maisie _ in a startling speech _ ponders
the nocturnal ``chill'' of death, amid action that involves
numerous children, two gunmen and even a bird.
</P>
<P>
   After the intermission, ``Blue Kettle'' carries the experiment
into the realm of language. A con man named Derek (played by Pearce
Quigley) tries to obtain legacies by duping elderly women into
believing he is the son they long ago gave up for adoption. As the
dialogue develops, the text is gradually taken over by the words
``blue'' and ``kettle'' and their component syllables and letters.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the language can be said to suffer a breakdown
comparable to that of Derek, who seems both to transmit and suffer
from a virus or plague that the syntactical collapse accompanies.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Daldry, the artistic director of the Royal Court in 1997
when ``Blue Heart'' opened, had that summer staged a 35-minute
Churchill piece called ``This Is a Chair'' in the same theater. An
audience of 60 sat on the Court stage, peering out at the
performers (Amanda Plummer, among them) high up in the auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   Daldry said he thought of ``Blue Heart'' as ``a playwright
saying, `What is the role of theater?' '' He continued, ``With
`Blue Kettle,' you've got a play that could be a good enough play
as it is, but there's a virus in it, and `Heart's Desire' is a play
that doesn't really have a story.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like the plays themselves are rebelling against
the idea of what a play is,'' he said, aware of the paradox that,
by breaking down form, Ms. Churchill only reinvigorates it. ``Caryl
is very, very bright. There isn't anyone else that has that degree
of joy at formal experimentation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue Heart'' marks the sixth Churchill play that
Stafford-Clark has directed in a collaboration dating back over 25
years. To him, ``these new plays come out of a distrust of or an
anger with theater; they're angry little antiplays, if you like.''
</P>
<P>
   And what are they like to act?
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, you have to be rather bright to be part of this,''
said Anna Wing, who is 84 and has a brief but telling scene in the
second play as one of Derek's victims. (Among her lines: ``Yes I
have blue a blue mental kettle of you with a lot of black hair.'')
``Of course, I'm not an intellectual,'' she said. ``I'm a simple
woman, really. But Caryl has an awareness of the human predicament;
she's very splendid.''
</P>
<P>
   A new addition to the cast is June Watson, who has pivotal roles
in both plays. In ``Heart's Desire,'' she is Alice, the mother,
whose efforts to set the table become a running gag that Ionesco
might have enjoyed. In ``Blue Kettle,'' it falls to her character,
Mrs. Plant, to ask the seemingly nonsensical ``T b k k k k l?'' _
which, in fact, means ``Would you like a cup of tea?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I started in the profession when I was 21,'' said Ms. Watson,
who is now 63, ``and I've never been in anything like this.'' The
first play, she said, demands the precision of farce: ``You're
continually repeating, then repeating at double and triple speed.
Everything has to be absolutely exact.'' With ``Blue Kettle,'' she,
like the entire cast, took refuge in Ms. Churchill's so-called
ur-script, which contains all the lines free of any invasive
``blue'' or ``kettle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There might be one or two people who get irritated by it,''
Ms. Watson said of that play's conceit, ``by the words being not
the words.'' But, she added, ``I would think if you're prepared to
let yourself go, it would be a wonderful experience.''

PATRIOTS DON'T WANT SHELL, GRIER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ If the Patriots want to add Art Shell as their assistant
head coach, they had better hope Brad Seely chooses not to join
Pete Carroll's staff Wednesday. But do they want Shell or don't
they?
</P>
<P>
   Seely, the former Carolina Panthers special teams coach, is down
to a choice between the Patriots and the Cleveland Browns, and if
he chooses New England when he makes his final decision, current
special teams coach Dante Scarnecchia would reluctantly agree to
take over New England's offensive line. Where that would leave
Shell is very likely in a shell game he has no interest in playing
and one the Patriots say they have no interest in initiating.
</P>
<P>
   Shell currently coaches the Atlanta Falcons' offensive line and
cannot even talk to the Patriots until after Sunday's Super Bowl,
but according to several of his friends, if there were no offensive
line job to occupy his time in New England, he would be unlikely to
join Carroll's staff in a supervisory role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Art is not going to go there just to be a figurehead,'' a
close friend of Shell's said. ``He wants to be a head coach, but
he's not going to New England to stand around all day and look like
he's waiting to replace Pete. That's not who he is. If he goes
there, he wants to help them win, and the way for him to do that is
to coach their line the same way he's coached the Falcons.''
</P>
<P>
   But Patriots vice president of player personnel Bobby Grier
issued an unusual press release Tuesday insisting that Carroll
would finalize his staff in 24-48 hours and that Shell would not be
a part of it under any circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Art Shell is not being considered for a position on Pete
Carroll's staff,'' the release said. ``We've made no effort to
contact him. In fact, he's not even available to be contacted by
another team. I expect Pete to finalize his coaching staff within
the next couple of days and I can assure you Art is not a
candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Grier's statement said he did not know how the Shell reports got
started, ``but quite frankly, I'm sick of this type of speculation.
If you read some of the reports in the papers, you would believe a
deal is already done. This type of speculation is a distraction to
everyone involved, and I hate to even comment on it. I'm sure Art
feels the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll has already offered the special teams job to Seely, a
longtime friend and former coaching associate who also was being
courted by the Baltimore Ravens before they filled their opening.
Scarnecchia, who was unhappy with the decision to fire offensive
line coach Paul Boudreau, initially balked at the idea of switching
to line coach but has told Carroll he would do whatever he is
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Shell, meanwhile, seems to be left where he has been for five
years _ searching for a second chance to be a head coach after
wining nearly 60 percent of his games on his first try, with the
Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday Shell declined comment on rumors that a new job might
await him after the Super Bowl, one that would make him one of the
few minority coaches in a supervisory position in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Shell confirmed that he had not been contacted by anyone in the
Patriots organization and that hadn't asked Falcons head coach Dan
Reeves for permission to so do after the Super Bowl. In fact, he
said he knew little beyond what he had read in the papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I want is a chance to sit down and talk with someone (in a
position to hire head coaches and coordinators),'' Shell said. ``If
you're asking me, do I deserve to be a head coach in the NFL, the
answer is yes. Certainly, it's been disappointing not to get a
second chance, because I feel I have something to offer. The key
thing is, I can lead men.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Shell became the first black head coach in 65 years to
lead men in the NFL, and within a year, he was named Coach of the
Year after taking the Los Angeles Raiders to the AFC Championship
Game. In his 5 1/2 years as head coach, his teams reached the
playoffs three times before he was fired after what was then viewed
by owner Al Davis as a dismal 9-7 season.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Raiders have failed to reach that level again,
yet Shell is not bitter about the firing or the fact that he has
been interviewed for only one other head job.
</P>
<P>
   He is not happy about that or about the NFL's dismal minority
hiring record, but bitterness is of no interest to him. What is of
interest is getting a second chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see the number of minorities running around football
fields, it accentuates the fact that only three guys are head
coaches in the NFL,'' Shell said. ``When Al hired me to coach the
Raiders, I felt ground had been broken and progress would be made.
I remember telling my good friend Terry Robiskie (who coached
Shell's offense) we must be successful because it would reflect on
all the minority coaches in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had success with the Raiders. Denny Green came along, and
then Ray Rhodes and Tony Dungy. We felt we'd done a good enough job
that blacks would get hired in the National Football League in
those roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, sure, it's disappointing not to have gotten a second
chance, but I've been in two other winning organizations (Kansas
City and Atlanta) since and I've seen different ways to do things.
It's helped me grow as a coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was bothered by the fact that eight of the nine
vacancies this season had been filled by white head coaches, many
of whom were relatively obscure assistants, Shell said, ``Every one
of those guys who were hired are good football coaches, so I don't
know if you can say it's a race problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never become bitter about the situation, because if you
become bitter, it's nonproductive. The commissioner has been trying
to do all he can to help improve the situation, but there's only so
much anyone can do until someone gives you a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Grier, that chance won't come with the Patriots.

McDONALD'S REPORTS EARNINGS GAINS, CITING PROMISING TURNAROUND 
(bl) 
By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ McDonald's Corp. said Tuesday that fourth-quarter
earnings were robust, increased by strong international sales and a
rejuvenated restaurant business in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The company also announced a 2-for-1 stock split, effective
March 5, and plans to raise its dividend 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street cheered the earnings report, which was in line with
analysts' expectations. Shares of McDonald's rose $3.0625, or 4
percent, to $78.9375, on the New York Stock Exchange, helping power
a broad rally in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   After a string of lackluster quarters and growing concerns about
the company's flagging U.S. sales in 1997, McDonald's said Tuesday
that its business had made a promising turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter, the fast-food chain said that net income
rose 9 percent, to $447.1 million, or 64 cents a diluted share,
from $410.9 million, or 58 cents a diluted share. Revenues also
rose 9 percent, to $3.22 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a great year,'' said Michael Conley, chief financial
officer at McDonald's in Oak Brook, Ill. ``We did change the
momentum of the U.S. business; in retrospect, we had had three
tough years.''
</P>
<P>
   While the earnings growth in the fourth quarter came as no
surprise to Wall Street analysts, who had predicted a
64-cents-a-share gain, according to First Call Corp., many analysts
said that Tuesday's earnings release offered additional signs that
McDonald's had made a strong turnaround in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   They said the company had been focusing more sharply on
profitability under Jack Greenberg, who took over as chief
executive in August, and that a new decentralized operating
structure _ which deeded more power to regional managers and
franchisees _ was showing good results.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's also saw steady growth in international markets, with
the greatest expansion occurring in Asia and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, McDonald's had worldwide sales of nearly $36
billion and profits of $1.7 billion in 1998. Earnings per share
rose 10 percent from 1997.
</P>
<P>
   That McDonald's was poised for a strong performance has been
evident in it stock performance. After falling 12 percent in 1996
and 1997, shares have risen 69 percent in the last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``McDonald's has been back on track all through 1998,'' said
Joseph Buckley, an analyst at Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co.

YEARBOOK SOFTWARE PUTS THOSE HIGH SCHOOL MEMORIES JUST A CLICK
AWAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- In hindsight, it was probably inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   First, typewriters were muscled out of the classroom by word
processors. Then LPs gave way to compact discs as the teen musical
medium of choice.
</P>
<P>
   Now the staid but proven high school yearbook is going digital,
thanks this time to suburban Thousand Oaks start-up YearDisc
Systems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The company, founded in 1997, has developed a start-to-finish
software package that it is marketing to schools as a cheaper,
faster and more dynamic way to record a year's worth of school
history, complete with sound, motion and hyperlinked text. As the
name implies, the YearDisc system bypasses paper and binding,
instead burning data directly to disk: CDs for now, but even more
powerful DVDs in years to come.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting yearbook, which the company duplicates for a fee,
requires a CD-equipped computer to play and, once installed,
operates much like a Web site. A main menu of buttons takes viewers
to multimedia pages dedicated to students, sports, clubs, dances
and other groups or special events.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have video clips of your prom, graduation or other
significant events in full color . . . and it's a lot easier to put
together,'' said Barry Peters, company co-founder and chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   YearDisc even throws in a free autograph book with each disk so
students can continue to write year-end messages to one another.
</P>
<P>
   Already the system is in place at a dozen schools serving as
beta testers, and a crew of independent and staff sales
representatives is busy hawking it to hundreds more campuses across
the country. Peters said that by the 1999-2000 school year, more
than 300 schools should have the system in place.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal, Peters said, lies in the program's price and power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The schools pay nothing upfront,'' he said. In addition to the
proprietary software, YearDisc provides campuses at no cost with a
450-megahertz Pentium II computer on which to produce their disk,
plus enough propaganda in the form of posters, T-shirts and
brochures to get students and faculty up to speed on just what the
system offers. In return, schools commit for three years to sell
100 of the electronic books annually at a cost of about $25 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always going to be people who want that paper book,
but this gives you extra depth,'' said Robert Haar, yearbook
adviser and a history teacher at Thousand Oaks High School, a
YearDisc test site. ``And it's student-driven as far as production
is concerned, giving them some opportunities to work . . . with
programs and equipment they'll use in the work environment outside
of school.''
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting a cover-your-bets approach, even Missouri-based
Walsworth Publishing Co., one of the nation's top traditional
yearbook publishers, is getting in on the act, recently partnering
with YearDisc to co-promote the product along with its own
services. Noting an increased interest in electronic publishing
overall, Walsworth said it teamed with YearDisc to stay ahead of
the curve.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few years ago there was a big push for video yearbooks, and
there are still some around, but not many,'' said David Massy,
Walsworth's instructional products manager. ``Maybe this'll be
something that'll stick around and maybe it won't. Who can tell?
But you never have anything to gain by standing in the way of
change.''

POPE URGES U.S. TO TAKE MORAL LEADERSHIP ROLE 

</HEADLINE>

and KIM COBB 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Welcomed by a beaming President Clinton and
thousands of cheering, flag-waving Catholics, Pope John Paul II
urged Tuesday that the United States aspire to a higher moral
vision.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing this country's turmoil over abortion to the
controversy surrounding slavery in the 19th century, John Paul
said, ``Only a higher moral vision can motivate the choice for
life.''
</P>
<P>
   The pontiff arrived in this historically Roman Catholic city for
a short meeting with Clinton as well as a youth rally, prayer
service and Mass spread out over two days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every nation faces times of trial, tests of national
character,'' he said. ``America has not been immune to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to St. Louis' link with the 19th-century Dred Scott
case, the pope said that the landmark, pre-Civil War decision by
the U.S. Supreme Court ``declared an entire class of human beings _
people of African descent _ outside the boundaries of the national
community and the Constitution's protection.''
</P>
<P>
   But today, he said, ``the conflict is between a culture that
affirms, cherishes and celebrates life, and a culture that seeks to
declare entire groups of human beings _ the unborn, the terminally
ill, the handicapped and others considered unuseful _ to be outside
the boundaries of legal protection.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Arriving in St. Louis immediately after a five-day visit to
Mexico City, the pope wore his 78 years heavily. He moved slowly
down the jet's stairway, his shoulders stooped, and used a cane to
walk across the tarmac. He shook hands with Clinton and first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The president took the pope's left elbow and guided him through
the crowd waiting in a nearby hangar. John Paul paused once to
stroke the cheek of a toddler in a stroller.
</P>
<P>
   Joining government officials for the welcoming ceremony were the
nation's nine cardinals and Bishop Joseph Fiorenza, head of the
Diocese of Galveston-Houston and president of the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
``Welcome on behalf of Houston,'' said the much taller Fiorenza,
bending low so that his face was even with the pope's.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A deep smile crossed the pope's ruddy face as the crowd cheered
his remarks at the airport. His left arm shook visibly during his
address.
</P>
<P>
   On this, his fifth U.S. tour, the pontiff stressed that the
moral leadership of the United States should equal its economic
prowess.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of America's great impact on the world as a whole, the
resolution of this new time of testing will have profound
consequences for the century whose threshold we are about to
cross,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the pope's fourth meeting with Clinton and his 85th
pastoral trip outside of Italy.
</P>
<P>
   In a 20-minute talk with the president, the pope again raised
the subject of dignity for all human life. White House spokesman
P.J. Crowley said, however, that the president had no response to
John Paul's brief private reference to abortion or to his public
remark about a ``culture of death'' in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pontiff's views on respect for human dignity and life are
well known,'' Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
   In welcoming the pope, Clinton said that John Paul has touched
American hearts. ``For 20 years, you have challenged us to think of
life not in terms of what we acquire for ourselves but in terms of
what we give of ourselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``On your last visit to the United States, you called on us to
truly build a society worthy of the human person,'' Clinton said.
``Today, you visit an America that is thriving, but also striving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am nowhere near as gifted a linguist as you are, Holy
Father,'' the president said. ``But as they say in your native
Poland: May you live 100 years and more.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the St. Louis residents attending the airport ceremony
were Cris Conner, who grew up in Houston; his wife, Yvonne; and
their children, Matthew, 13, and Meredith, 12. The family won
tickets to the event in a lottery at church.
</P>
<P>
   Yvonne Conner said welcoming the pope added a new dimension to
her faith. Her husband, a convert to Catholicism, called it ``the
greatest experience imaginable.'' Matthew said he yearned to know
more about the pope's childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did he spend all of his childhood years in church and praying,
or was he a comical prankster like me?'' Matthew wondered. ``Did he
have a Bible before he had a squirt gun? When he was 18, did he
have a license plate that said, ``Born to be pope?'''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, it looked as though St. Louis's downtown
streets, its Kiel Center and a huge park-like area dubbed the Papal
Plaza had become the site of a huge gospel-rock concert. There were
posters, placards, big-name Christian bands and even a Christian
juggler.
</P>
<P>
   In a city where one-third of the citizenry is Catholic, a papal
visit is something to celebrate. Vendors hawked commemorative
T-shirts, and people stood five deep along sidewalks, waving,
cheering and crying as the papal motorcade wound its way to the
residence of St. Louis Archbishop Justin Rigali.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday evening, a vintage John Paul spoke during evening
prayer with 20,000 young people at the Kiel Center. Throughout his
reign, John Paul II has enjoyed a special rapport with youth,
drawing hundreds of thousands to international World Youth Days and
to huge outdoor Masses in nations circling the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Before his speech at Kiel, he met local baseball legend Mark
McGwire, a lifelong Catholic, who knelt to kiss the pontiff's ring.
</P>
<P>
   Later, despite his obvious fatigue, John Paul proved that he is
still capable of playing a crowd with a master showman's sense of
timing. At the Kiel Center, he paused, gauging youths' reaction to
one of the lighter moments in his address.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am told there was much excitement in St. Louis during the
recent baseball season, when two greater players (Mark McGwire and
Sammy Sosa) were competing to break the home-run record,'' the
pontiff said, provoking laughter and prolonged applause from his
towel-waving, baseball-hat-wearing audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can feel the same great enthusiasm as you train for a
different goal: the goal of following Christ, the goal of bringing
his message to the world,'' the pope said.
</P>
<P>
   He drew wild cheers when he told the young people: ``Tonight,
the pope belongs to you!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Young friends, in the days and weeks and years ahead, for as
long as you remember this evening, remember that the pope came to
the United States to call the young people of America to Christ, to
challenge you to be the light of the world!
</P>
<P>
   ``The pope believes in you, and he expects great things of
you!'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the pope arrived, tens of thousands of young people
huddled against the cold near St. Louis' famous Gateway Arch for a
march through downtown and a daylong youth rally featuring gospel
singers and motivational speakers.
</P>
<P>
   The youngsters whooped, cheered and sang through the streets.
Some carried banners identifying their home parishes.
</P>
<P>
   Wilford Salinas, an 18-year-old high school senior from Justin,
Texas, said this was the third trip he had made to see the pope.
This trip, he added, promised to be as exciting as the first.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Leible, a 16-year-old from Perryville, Mo., leaned on
crutches outside the Kiel Center, waiting to pass through security.
She wasn't about to miss the rally because of an injured foot, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the chance of a lifetime to even be in his presence,''
she gushed. ``I think he's just amazing. He's done so much for the
youth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of my close friends aren't Catholic,'' said Cara
Scatizzi, 17 of Wildwood, Mo. ``But when I told them I was coming,
they thought it was pretty cool.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a feeling of being part of something,'' said
her friend Matt Hay, 17.

A PROSECUTOR SEEKS TO SHOW THAT MICROSOFT THWARTED COMPETITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A senior executive of the Microsoft Corp. testified
Tuesday that his company tried to convince its main rival in the
Internet software market to become less of a head-on competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Maritz, the highest-ranking executive appearing as a
witness at the Microsoft antitrust trial, portrayed the discussions
with the Netscape Communications Corp. in 1995 as mainly an effort
to find ``common ground'' between the two companies.
</P>
<P>
   But the government maintains that a June 1995 meeting was a
crucial episode in its sweeping antitrust case. After Netscape
rejected Microsoft's proposal, the government contends, Microsoft
embarked on what the prosecution regards as a pattern of practices
intended to thwart competition.
</P>
<P>
   David Boies, the Justice Department's lead trial lawyer,
presented several Microsoft e-mails written shortly before the
Netscape meeting saying that Microsoft wanted to make sure
Netscape's software for browsing the World Wide Web did not become
a technology ``platform'' for which software programmers would
write applications _ making it a potential alternative to
Microsoft's industry-standard Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   In a June 1, 1995 e-mail, one Microsoft executive identified key
goals as ``move Netscape out'' of Internet browser software for
future versions of Windows and to ``avoid a cold or hot war with
Netscape.'' adding, ``Keep them from sabotaging our platform
evolution.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked to comment on this e-mail and others, Maritz replied,
``We clearly had an agenda for making certain technologies common
in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   But in some of the sharpest questioning since the trial began
last October, Boies persistently asked an elusive Maritz about the
implications of Microsoft's proposal. If Netscape had agreed to
shift its focus away from software that Microsoft deemed mainstream
to its strategic interests, he asked, would Netscape have become a
``less significant platform threat?''
</P>
<P>
   That, Maritz conceded, was partly true. ``At one level, yes,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he noted Microsoft was mainly trying to get Netscape to
agree to Microsoft's preferred set of basic Internet technologies
and nothing in their talks would have prevented Netscape from
competing in other Internet-related software, including multimedia
software, groupware and Java, an Internet programming language.
</P>
<P>
   The result, he said, could have been that Netscape would have
become an even more formidable rival. If Netscape had focused less
on the browser and more on software and services that compete less
directly with Microsoft, for example, Maritz said Netscape might
have a ``much more entrenched position within large corporations
today.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, Maritz said the result of Microsoft's proposal might
have been to reduce competition in certain niches of the software
business, but not to diminish competition overall.
</P>
<P>
   William H. Neukom, Microsoft's senior vice president for law and
corporate affairs, said words matter less than actions in antitrust
law. ``After that meeting,'' he said, ``there was full-fledged
competition between Microsoft and Netscape.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the government replies that the head-to-head competition
occurred only after Netscape rejected Microsoft's proposal. After
Tuesday afternoon court session, Boies said, ``It is significant
for our case that Microsoft has admitted seeking to persuade
Netscape not to engage in platform competition.''
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, the government tried to raise questions about
the credibility of Microsoft's current legal stance by accusing the
company of engaging in a ``concerted effort'' to alter the words
used to describe Internet software internally and in its public
statements to suit the company's legal stance.
</P>
<P>
   The government pointed to company e-mail from early last year
that said Microsoft had to make sure that the word ``browser'' was
no longer used in referring to its Internet browsing software and
that the ``legal staff'' be brought in to check the language.
</P>
<P>
   The wording plays a role in the case because the government
contends that the software maker bundled its Internet Explorer
browser into its Windows operating system to thwart competition in
the Internet software market.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft replies that since the rise of the Internet the
company had always planned to fold the software used to browse the
World Wide Web into its operating system. The browser, Microsoft
insists, is merely a feature of the operating system and not a
stand-alone product.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail in February 1998, a Microsoft executive, wrote that
``saying `put the browser in the OS' is already a statement that is
prejudicial to us,'' and went on, ``The name `browser' suggests a
separate thing.'' (OS stands for operating system.)
</P>
<P>
   In another e-mail in February 1998, a Microsoft executive
reported ``good progress'' in cleaning up the wording used on the
company's Web site. ``We don't refer to it as a product or even a
browser,'' he wrote. ``It's browsing software.''
</P>
<P>
   By early 1998, Microsoft was already being sued by the Justice
Department in a related case concerning a 1995 antitrust consent
decree. Maritz emphasized that the change in the approved corporate
vernacular was mainly to clearly explain the consumer benefits of
tightly integrating the browser with the operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Maritz said the legal environment also played a role,
necessitating the use of ``more precise language'' as ``this set of
events was heating up.''

   Boeing Co. released quarterly results Tuesday that were better
than expected, and it tried to assure investors made wary by a
string of unpleasant surprises over the last 16 months that it was
finally turning itself around. But Wall Street remained skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, the world's largest aerospace company and the United
States' largest single exporter, beat by 3 cents a share the
average estimate of Wall Street analysts surveyed by First Call
Corp. Analysts said that the company's military and space divisions
were stronger than they had expected and that the company had
benefited from a favorable tax rate.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing earned $465 million, or 48 cents a share, in the fourth
quarter, including a $30 million tax credit worth 3 cents a share.
In the same period in 1997, the company lost $498 million, or 51
cents a share, including an after-tax charge of $876 million, or 89
cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   The company stunned Wall Street last month by announcing that
its projected earnings over the next two years would be as much as
40 percent lower than analysts were estimating. The company said it
would earn $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion in 1999 on revenue of $58
billion and $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion in 2000 on revenue of $49
billion.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Philip Condit, Boeing's chief executive, said the
company was now expecting to hit the high end of those projections.
``What you will see is a lot more aggressive attention to the
numbers,'' he told analysts, reiterating his commitment to
revamping Boeing's antiquated accounting and manufacturing systems.
</P>
<P>
   To underscore the point, he formally introduced Deborah Hopkins,
Boeing's new chief financial officer. Condit praised Ms. Hopkins,
who held a similar post at General Motors Europe, as a ``change
agent'' and added that she had already had a strong impact on
Boeing after only five weeks on the job.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Hopkins' initial progress may say more about how far
Boeing has to go than about how far it has come. Speaking to
analysts, she said she had started a companywide campaign to
educate Boeing senior executives about such common measures of
profitability as return on investment and inventory turnover. She
also said the company's top managers now know how much each Boeing
passenger airplane costs to produce.
</P>
<P>
   As impressive as Ms. Hopkins' performance may have been, Wall
Street remained cautious. Boeing shares fell $1 Tuesday, to $35, on
the New York Stock Exchange. The price is now 38 percent below its
52-week high of $56.25 set in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once burned, twice shy,'' said Byron Callan, an analyst at
Merrill Lynch, summing up the feelings of many investors. ``Is this
something of a turning point?'' he added. ``Yes. But it is going to
take time.''
</P>
<P>
   One investor who believes Boeing stock is a bargain is Boeing
itself. In the last half of 1998, the company spent $1.3 billion to
buy 3.5 percent of its stock, or 35.2 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing had revenue of $17.1 billion in the fourth quarter,
compared with $11.73 billion in the last quarter of 1997. Much of
the increase came from delivering a record 191 passenger jets. But
the company still earned no profit from making the airplanes
because of its production difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hopkins said that would change this year, when the company
plans to deliver a record 620 airplanes, compared with 563 in 1998.
Still, commercial airplane profit margins are expected to be only 2
percent to 3 percent this year and 1 percent to 3 percent in 2000,
when Boeing will cut production to 480 jets.
</P>
<P>
   The company's military and space divisions, which it acquired
from McDonnell Douglas and Rockwell International in the last two
years, helped to counter the airplane division's poor showing.
Operating profits of combined businesses rose 46 percent, to $452
million, at the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hopkins said Boeing was once again evaluating its forecast
and would announce new long-term profit targets within 30 to 60
days. But Callan of Merrill Lynch, who has seen several recent
Boeing pronouncements come to naught, was wary.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a side of me,'' he said of the company's projections,
``that says, `Just leave them where they are.'''

 Crackdown on Securities Lawbreakers  &HT;       
 By Mark Veverka  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
There's a new sheriff in town, and he doesn't take kindly to
white-collar cowboys who break securities laws.
</P>
<P>
   Robert S. Mueller III has only been U.S. attorney in these parts
for about six months, but he already is showing that he's a man of
his word. Not long after being appointed federal prosecutor for
Northern California, Mueller declared that he was going to make
fighting white-collar crime a priority, particularly insider
trading and high-tech-related fraud in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of the local Securities and Exchange Commission
office, Mueller has nabbed his first suspects. Together, the U.S.
Attorney's Office and the SEC filed insider-trading charges against
two former employees of Advanced Fibre Communications, a Petaluma
telecommunications concern.
</P>
<P>
   Three people have been named in a criminal indictment and civil
complaint. They are Chi-lin Tom, 45, a former director of design
verification, and Hong Lu, a 27-year-old engineer. Hong Lu's wife,
Yi Lu, 27, also was cited in the civil complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Both the criminal and civil charges contend that the high-tech
workers made $327,000 in profits by illegally trading in Advanced
Fibre options last June and July. The two men allegedly learned
that Advanced Fibre was going to announce lower-than-expected
revenues for the second quarter. And they used that information,
prior to the announcement, to buy options contracts that paid them
off when their employer's stock price declined.
</P>
<P>
   The criminal indictment, which was brought by a federal grand
jury on Monday, charges each man with one count of conspiracy, one
count of securities fraud and two counts of mail fraud. In
addition, each man faces four counts of making false statements to
the SEC, and one count of obstruction of justice. Both men pleaded
not guilty yesterday, and each was released on $50,000 bond.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of STREET27 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The SEC's civil complaint, which often can bring only monetary
fines and other wrist-slaps, accuses the men of committing illegal
insider trading. Advanced Fibre shares slipped only 6 cents to
$13.44 on the news.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC referred the case to Mueller's office because
investigators felt there was strong evidence that the high-tech
employees were deliberate in how they used insider information to
execute their trades, says Helane Morrison, head of enforcement at
the SEC's San Francisco office.
</P>
<P>
   But more important, ``we think they lied to us during our
investigation,'' Morrison says.
</P>
<P>
   If so, the obstruction of justice charges filed by federal
prosecutors could send the accused to the slammer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's appropriate for them to face jail time for their
conduct,'' Morrison says.
</P>
<P>
   And that's why Mueller's interest in fighting white-collar crime
could have a resounding impact on questionable trading practices in
Silicon Valley, where workers are flush with shares and exposed to
important financial information.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, insider-trading investigations are brought by
the SEC and result in noncriminal penalties, says Joe Grundfest, a
law professor at Stanford University and former SEC commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as he tells his students, any attempt to interfere with an
investigation can lead to harsher penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Perjury and obstruction of justice ``are the surest way to
convert a civil matter ... into a potential criminal offense,''
Grundfest says.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the heightened cooperation between the top cop for
Northern California and the local SEC office is no coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to have a close working relationship with the
SEC in order to pursue insider-trading and fraud cases when
appropriate,'' says Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Mueller has recruited some big guns to his staff
who boast experience in prosecuting insider-trading and other
securities fraud cases.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Mueller appointed a former New York City
prosecutor, David Shapiro, to chief of the criminal division. Among
other things, Shapiro, who most recently was in the Oakland office,
has extensive experience investigating securities, wire and
bankruptcy-fraud cases. He currently is assigned to the continuing
criminal case against executives at Media Vision Technology in
Fremont.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of STREET27 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Another recent addition to Mueller's staff is Leslie Caldwell, an
assistant U.S. attorney from Brooklyn, N.Y., who has been named
Shapiro's deputy and chief of the office's economic crime division.
One of her most recent assignments was to crack down on small-cap
stock fraud, directing investigations into such illegal practices
as market manipulation and unlawful short-selling.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, appointing some prosecutors with experience at
tracking down cheats on Wall Street isn't a bad career strategy,
either. After all, putting Michael Milken behind bars worked out
pretty well for then-federal prosecutor Rudolph Giuliani.

BOARD OF MEDICAL JOURNAL DEFENDS AN OUSTED EDITOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By GINA KOLATA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Editors and members of the editorial board of the Journal of the
American Medical Association are defending the dismissed editor of
the publication in its next issue.
</P>
<P>
   The editor, Dr. George D. Lundberg, was dismissed last week
because he published a paper reporting that many Midwestern college
students, surveyed eight years ago, did not consider oral sex to be
``having sex.'' The association's vice president, Dr. E. Ratcliffe
Anderson Jr., said that Lundberg had expedited the article for a
political purpose, to coincide with the impeachment trial of
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial criticizing Anderson for dismissing Lundberg,
editors of the association's journals say that ``innumerable
commentators worldwide'' viewed that action as ``a direct threat to
the journal's historic tradition and integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Their editorial appears in next Wednesday's issue of the journal
and was released Tuesday. Jeff Molter, a journal spokesman, said
the signers of the editorial ``wanted to get this out as quickly as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The journal also released a news article to be published next
week on Lundberg's dismissal and the reactions it engendered. It
stated that the journal had received hundreds of comments from
supporters and critics Anderson's action.
</P>
<P>
   In discharging Lundberg, Anderson said that the immediate cause
was the oral sex article but that he had over time ``lost
confidence and trust'' in Lundberg. Anderson would not be specific,
but many observers said that in his 17 years as editor of the
Journal of the American Medical Association, Lundberg had nettled
some people with his strong opinions and the sometimes
controversial papers he published.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Ewe Reinhardt, an editorial board member and health
economist at Princeton University who protested the dismissal,
noted that Lundberg had irritated some doctors with his comments on
autopsies on the CBS News program ``60 Minutes.'' A ``60 Minutes''
producer, Walt Bogdanich, reported that Lundberg had said, ``Some
doctors, some medical staff, are afraid to find out what happened
in people who died.''
</P>
<P>
   The signers of the editorial state that Lundberg made the
journal ``a world-class scientific publication.'' They said that
although Anderson had the authority to dismiss Lundberg, they
strongly disagreed with the decision. And they reaffirmed their
commitment to the journal's editorial independence.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson declined to be interviewed. A spokeswoman, Linda
Stepanich, said he released a statement Tuesday that called the
editorial ``a clear, balanced assessment of several important
issues that go to the heart of JAMA's integrity and excellence.''
It added that Anderson was pleased by the endorsement of the
journal's editorial independence.
</P>
<P>
   Lundberg, reached at his home Tuesday, said he could only read a
prepared statement: ``On advice of counsel, I continue to not make
statements except to express profound gratitude to leaders of
American and international medicine for their support of me and of
the academic publication process.''

MEXICO'S CENTRAL BANK IS OPTIMISTIC ON ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Mexico has already weathered the worst blows of
the global economic crisis and is not likely to suffer severe
trauma from the instability in Brazil even if it deepens, top
finance officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The relatively sanguine prognosis for Mexico came from senior
officials of the Banco de Mexico, the central bank, as they
announced that they would take more aggressive action to rein in
inflation in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Despite dizzying fluctuations in many emerging markets last year
and a drop in the price of crude oil, one of Mexico's main exports,
by about 30 percent, the economy held its own overall, the
officials said, growing by about 4.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers continued to spend, although more cautiously toward
the end of 1998, and official unemployment reached the lowest
levels of the decade at 2.6 percent. Most economists believe these
official figures do not reflect the large numbers of Mexicans who
only have part-time jobs or have precarious income from street
vending or other insecure work. But they remain an indicator of the
creation of formal jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico is better protected than other Latin American countries
from the disarray in Brazil, the region's largest economy, the
officials said. Less than 1 percent of Mexico's foreign trade is
with Brazil, while more than 80 percent of its manufacturing
exports are sold in the United States, where growth is projected to
slow only mildly this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There just aren't many paths by which the crisis in Brazil can
reach us,'' one senior central bank official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our principal nexus is with the United States, and we hope
that it will maintain its growth,'' another official said. ``As
they say, you should hitch your wagon to a rising star.''
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts said the Mexican officials were too optimistic
but not completely off base.
</P>
<P>
   ``No country in Latin America is as far removed from Brazil in
terms of trade and investment flows as Mexico,'' said Gray Newman,
senior Latin American economist at Merrill Lynch. ``There are
really two Latin Americas, one with a hub in Brazil and another in
Mexico. But it's a little too early to say they are decoupled.
Mexico is still vulnerable to investor sentiment about all the
emerging markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Economists noted that the peso slipped only slightly, to 10.15
to the dollar in New York on Tuesday from 10.23 on Monday, after
Brazil's currency _ the real _ was allowed to float earlier this
month and lost 30 percent of its value.
</P>
<P>
   The view at the Banco de Mexico is that international conditions
cannot get much more unsteady than they were in 1998, with Russia's
default on part of its debt and the uncertainties in Asia. The
central bank's estimates are based on an estimated average price
for Mexican crude oil this year of only $9.25 a barrel, and the
officials do not believe prices can go much lower than that.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The officials said they were ``not happy'' that inflation ended
the year at 18.6 percent, well above the original goal of 12
percent. Inflation was increased by some devaluation of the peso,
by increases in prices of basic goods like gasoline and tortillas,
and by erratic weather, which ruined many food crops and made
produce more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank will stick to its policy of allowing the peso
to float but will react faster and more aggressively to
international shocks, which depress the currency and fuel
inflation. The bank will continue to limit the amount of money in
circulation every day as an anti-inflationary measure.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank also restricts bank lending by forcing banks to
maintain the equivalent of $1.9 billion in deposits in the central
bank. Although the policy raises interest rates in the short term,
in the long term it reduces inflation by strengthening the peso and
encouraging foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to have a very careful, very vigilant,
fundamentally very restrictive policy,'' one top official said.

 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Jessie Tuggle and Eugene Robinson, a linebacker and a
free safety, stand tall here at Super Bowl XXXIII. Both are Atlanta
Falcons. Tuggle is 33. Robinson is 35. Both have played at least 12
professional seasons and are football purists, loquacious and
spirited leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Tuggle is the leading active tackler among all National Football
League players. Counting this year's playoffs, he has made 1,701
tackles in 187 games. Robinson ranks second among all active
players with, counting the playoffs, 1,253 tackles in 218 National
Football League games.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that's some hitting. Some mileage. We can read it a couple
of ways. First, Tuggle and Robinson have played so long for such
lousy teams that they were always on the field, giving both
frequent opportunities to tackle. Also, both have such a nose for
the ball, such a feel for the flow of an offense, that they usually
finish with a hand, a shoulder, a helmet on the ball carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Cut it anyway and the conclusion is this:
</P>
<P>
   1.) Tuggle and Robinson paint the Falcons' defense with a
glowing shell of experience, appreciation, confidence, attitude and
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   2.) The Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXXIII on Sunday must
account for these two players in their offensive game plan by
either attacking them directly or by running plays away from their
zones.
</P>
<P>
   By all means, do not ignore them.
</P>
<P>
   The careers of Tuggle and Robinson unfolded that way, with fans
and peers around the league generally ignoring their talents and
savvy. Tuggle is in his 12th pro season, all with Atlanta, and
before this season he had played in three playoff games. Robinson
is in his 14th season, and in his first 11 in Seattle he played in
two playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   Do your primary work in the regular season and people tend to
think of you _ with the infrequent exception of a player such as
Detroit's Barry Sanders _ as a regular player.
</P>
<P>
   This season Tuggle broke the NFL career record for touchdowns
scored off fumble recoveries with six and Robinson improved as the
career leader in interceptions among active players with 53.
</P>
<P>
   Both players kept making big plays for a defense that has helped
thrust Atlanta into the Super Bowl. Both were undrafted free agents
_ Tuggle from Valdosta State, Robinson from Colgate _ who used to
live in anonymity but now stand tall here at Super Bowl XXXIII.
</P>
<P>
   For Robinson, the rise in post-season stature began two years
earlier than it did for Tuggle. This is Robinson's third
consecutive Super Bowl. He played in the last two with the Green
Bay Packers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in Seattle, and when we didn't win consistently,
people didn't come knocking on my door,'' Robinson said. ``I didn't
get attention. No big endorsements. So, I don't care now if people
jump on my bandwagon or the Atlanta Falcons' bandwagon. I have been
there when nobody was screaming and hollering. I know what that
feels like when nobody cares. So, jump right on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that Jessie feels the same way. He told me the other
day: `Hey, we've been down for so long and now we're up! And we're
going to win this thing!' I'm happy for what's happened for me and
Jessie Tuggle. The Lord has shown us much favor.''
</P>
<P>
   For both of them, for the Falcons, it took so long. ``I used to
sit there and say maybe this will be the year for the Atlanta
Falcons; no, maybe this will be the year for the Atlanta Falcons;
no maybe this will be the ... '' Tuggle said, breaking off the
thought and shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been 32 Super Bowls played and the Atlanta Falcons
have not been close to any one of them. I haven't been as a player.
I had to be realistic about it. I was beginning to think I'd play
my career without this chance. I looked around and I was getting
old and I didn't even realize it, but then it started to sink in
the last couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this game, I have the chance to show the people around the
country and the world that I can play. We have the chance to change
the whole image of the Atlanta Falcons for good. The best thing I
can say about the past is it's behind us. The greatest thing I can
say about the future is come Sunday, I know that this did not come
easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson is a rangy player in size (6 feet 1, 197 pounds) and in
the way he plays free safety. He covers plenty of ground in the
passing game yet supports the run defense. He has terrific
technique and is a thinking man's defensive back. Cornerbacks love
playing with him because they know he will always be there, over
the top, covering the cornerbacks' backside.
</P>
<P>
   Tuggle (5-11, 230) was not considered big enough to play
linebacker in the NFL. Scouts called him too short, too small. But
he has proved them all wrong. He is a consummate captain of the
Atlanta defense. And he packs a punch. When Tuggle busts you in the
mouth, you know you have been busted in the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson loves to say that: bust you in the mouth. He is
counting on the Falcons' defense to play Denver in that fashion,
not retreating or playing on its heels but fighting. Tirelessly.
The key, he said, is for his teammates to remember that the Broncos
are mere men. Tuggle, meanwhile, takes the lead in keeping the
Falcons' united _ no personal agendas, no divisive wedges. Their
teammates call Tuggle the Hammer and Robinson the Prophet.
</P>
<P>
   Tuggle and Robinson will tell you that losing, plain and simple,
stinks.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this will be the year for Tuggle and Robinson. Maybe this
will be the year for the Atlanta Falcons, maybe this will be the
year for the Atlanta Falcons, maybe this will be the ... Well,
finally, it is.
</P>
<P>
   Tuggle, Robinson and the Falcons all stand tall here at Super
Bowl XXXIII.

<P>
   MIAMI _ Win or lose this weekend, Terance Mathis has had a
lifesaving year.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta receiver, whose name is generally linked with fellow
receiver Tony Martin, admitted Tuesday that alcoholism, and an
ensuing deep depression, nearly ended his career a couple of years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   In an exclusive interview with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution,
Mathis detailed a typical day of drinking that generally began with
couple of beers before lunch and didn't end until the wee hours of
the morning, when he would often find himself checking into a hotel
because he couldn't drive home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to come clean,'' Mathis told the paper. ``And
hopefully, doing so will allow me to help other people with the
same problem I experienced. I figure there's someone out there who
can relate, who I can help. But there was a time (when) I was
scared that my (drinking) would hurt somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Falcons coach Dan Reeves who put Mathis in touch with a
doctor. Rather than go into a clinic, he quit cold turkey. He
admits he drinks a beer or two in a social setting but says he's
cured of the need to overindulge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been chewing at me and chewing at me for a long time,''
Mathis said when questioned about the interview he gave. ``This was
the first opportunity I've had in my career when I could speak
about Terance Mathis. That was one of the obstacles I've overcome
to reach this week.''
</P>
<P>
   The realization saved his career. Mathis and Martin didn't get
as much attention as other tandems, particularly Vikings rookie
Randy Moss and Cris Carter, but the Atlanta duo finished just seven
yards behind as the second-most prolific twosome this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're right up there with those guys,'' Martin said before the
NFC Championship Game. ``But attention will come.''
</P>
<P>
   It certainly came after Mathis and Martin combined for 202 yards
and two touchdowns in the Falcons' 30-27 overtime win over
Minnesota on Jan. 17, earning them some of the Super Bowl
spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people were very surprised,'' Mathis said. ``When the
magazines came out and the predictions come out, the media makes
all of their superstars before the games are played. We were always
taught that you don't hand out medals for people at the 10-meter
mark of a 100-meter race. You give the medals out when it's all
over with. You can have as many catches as you want, but the big
key for Tony and me is to know our roles with this football team.
We're going to do the job and whatever is asked of us.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no ego problems between the two. Their regular-season
statistics were nearly identical. Martin caught 66 passes for 1,181
yards. Mathis caught 64 for 1,136. Mathis, however, got into the
end zone more often, scoring 11 touchdowns to Martin's six.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis scored two touchdowns against Minnesota. Martin had a
spectacular 70-yard gain to help set up a fourth-quarter field goal
by Morten Andersen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can break the defense down by going deep,'' Martin said.
``And Terance can break the defense down by moving the sticks, with
third-down plays. That's how we complement one another, although
he's also been a deep threat this season.''
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a couple of guys who weren't expected to do much in
the NFL. Mathis was selected in the sixth round of the 1990 draft
by the Jets. He started only one game in four years and had only 93
catches for 1,242 yards and four touchdowns in that time. In his
first season with Atlanta (1994), he had 111 catches for 1,342
yards and 11 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, a quarterback in college, was a fifth-round pick in '89
by the Jets, who converted him to wide receiver. He was then
released on the final cut and picked up by Miami, which signed him
to the developmental squad. He started eight games for Miami in
four years, then was traded to San Diego (1994) for a fourth-round
pick.
</P>
<P>
   Martin proved quite a deal for the Chargers. His first catch was
a 61-yarder against Cincinnati. One week later, he tied an NFL
record with a 99-yard touchdown catch at Seattle. He helped lead
the Chargers to Super Bowl XXIX by catching the 43-yard winning
touchdown pass against Pittsburgh in the AFC Championship Game.
</P>
<P>
   This season, however, proved to be Martin's best. His 1,181
yards were a career high, as was his 17.9-yard average per catch.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis and Martin have been in the background all season, and
not just because of other receiving tandems. They also have been in
the shadow of Atlanta Pro Bowl running back Jamal Anderson, the
player other teams focus on when trying to stop Atlanta's offense.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Vikings held Anderson to 67 carries on 27 yards in
the NFC Championship Game, it was Mathis and Martin who kept
Atlanta's offense going.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone always talks about, `If we can just stop Jamal
Anderson, we can win,''' Mathis said. ``Jamal deserves all the
talk. He's been great this year. But I think we've proven that you
can't overlook us, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to catch 100 balls apiece. We talk about our age.
We're the old guys (Mathis is 31, Martin 33) _ no respect for old
guys. We didn't talk about being the best tandem in the league; we
just talked about being the best old guys at our position. We had
fun with that. We've had fun with our age and things we've overcome
to get to this point.''

EDITORIAL: THE POPE'S MESSAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Jan. 27: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Pope John Paul II completes his eighth visit to North
America. In his appearances in recent days in Mexico City and St.
Louis, he spoke haltingly at times and walked unsteadily. But his
message _ the primacy of the human being _ rang out. Early in his
papacy he attacked the dehumanization of communism, and now he
sounds warnings about the human costs of hard-edged capitalism.
World events have risen and fallen around John Paul, but his theme
has never changed.
</P>
<P>
   In his mass in Mexico City's Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe,
he attacked Latin America's free-market policies for their neglect
of the poor and their ``purely economic conception of man.'' He
blamed globalization for causing environmental destruction and a
growing gap between rich and poor. He criticized the materialism
inspired by the media.
</P>
<P>
   When the pope was elected in 1978, his first foreign visit took
him not to his native Poland but to the Dominican Republic and
Mexico, which has more Catholics than any nation except Brazil. His
latest trip to Mexico was his fourth, and the country's embrace
seemed even warmer for his failing health.
</P>
<P>
   One of the pope's goals in Mexico was to stop the flood of
millions of Catholics who have joined evangelical Protestant
churches. He was also trying to attract young people to the
priesthood. There is only one priest for every 13,000 parishioners
in Latin America. Some of the church's problems stem from John
Paul's conservative views on doctrinal matters, especially birth
control and divorce, which have convinced many Latins that the
church is irrelevant to their daily lives.
</P>
<P>
   The church in the United States has also experienced a shortage
of priests, and officials here are worried about Catholic adhesion
among young people, whose views on premarital sex, homosexuality
and birth control are far more liberal than those of their parents.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul also sought to warn Mexicans of the dangers of
technology, which can lead, the pope said, to a world without a
soul. His trip, however, inadvertently reveals the magnitude of
what he is battling. He has always relied on modern media to
enhance his extraordinary charisma and communication with his
faithful. Before he spoke of technological dangers in Aztec
Stadium, the arena's screen blazed with greetings to the pope
transmitted from all over the hemisphere. His criticisms of
materialism were part of a trip underwritten by Pepsi-Cola and
several other companies. Pope John Paul won his battle with
communism, but his struggle to mount a spiritual critique of
capitalism and a global commercial culture promises to be an even
more complex task. &QL;

COLOMBIAN IMMIGRANTS WORRY AND WAIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By VIVIAN TOY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Cristina Marquez couldn't stop crying on Monday
night, worrying about her grandmother, who had just narrowly
escaped being crushed to death in her family home in Armenia,
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think about anything else,'' said Ms. Marquez, who
immigrated from Armenia three years ago and now works as a waitress
at La Pequena Colombia in Jackson Heights, Queens. ``I just keep
seeing my grandmother and all my family. They're all alive, thank
God, but now they have no home, nowhere to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two-thirds of Ms. Marquez's hometown was reduced to
rubble when an earthquake hit Colombia's central coffee-growing
region Monday, and hundreds were confirmed dead.
</P>
<P>
   Many Colombian immigrants like Ms. Marquez spent the day Tuesday
trying to reach relatives in Armenia or in Pereira, a nearby city
that also was hard hit by the earthquake. Local Colombian community
leaders gathered at the Colombian Consulate on Tuesday to help
coordinate efforts to get medical supplies, bottled water, basic
housing needs and money to earthquake victims.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Marquez said she tried in vain to contact her family and
friends and only learned that her grandmother, her sister and an
assortment of uncles and aunts had survived when a family friend
was able to get word to Ms. Marquez's husband, who lives in Cali, a
city about 100 miles southwest of Armenia. ``My husband called to
tell me they were OK,'' she said, ``but even he was shaken up
because he felt the earthquake all the way in Cali.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Marquez said that she often teased her 74-year-old
grandmother because of her penchant for complaining about minor
aches and pains, but she said her grandmother's mild hypochondria
ultimately saved her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said she wasn't feeling too good, so she made my uncle
take her to the doctor, and that's the only reason they weren't in
the house when it fell,'' Ms. Marquez said. ``It saved them,
otherwise they would have been killed.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that her father, with whom she lives in Jackson
Heights, desperately wants to get back to Colombia now. ``He said
he needs to go,'' she said. ``He needs to see the house where he
grew up, even though there's nothing left. Everybody wants to go,
but it's impossible right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jairo G. Casas, a leader of the Colombian community in
Queens, said that many of the estimated 80,000 Colombian immigrants
in Queens are from Armenia and Pereira.
</P>
<P>
   Casas, who is from Bogota, said friends in Colombia called to
say that hospitals need blood and basic medical supplies like gauze
and antibiotics to treat the injured. So Casas has gone on local
Spanish television and radio shows with that appeal and dozens of
people have already contacted his office to make donations. He said
he hoped to start a blood drive for earthquake victims within the
next few days. The Colombian Consulate also has established a bank
account to accept contributions to help earthquake victims.
</P>
<P>
   William Salgado, an attorney and a former president of the
Colombian Civic Center, said that hundreds of people have called
his agency to offer help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm from Bogota and none of my immediate relatives were
affected, but you can't distance yourself when something like this
happens,'' he said. ``Somebody always knows somebody else who was
affected, maybe it's a neighbor or a neighbor's friend, but there's
somebody close by who's fretting over their loved ones and
everything they have lost.''
</P>
<P>
   John Galvez, a waiter at La Pequena Colombia, went to work
Tuesday, even though it was his day off. He said he just had to
share his relief that his wife and 7-year-old daughter, whom he
left behind in Pereira, were all right.
</P>
<P>
   ``And really I just wanted to hold them and hug my parents, but
they're in Pereira, too, so I came here instead,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Galvez said everyone in his family survived because they live
outside the city center, where the earthquake did the most damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my daughter is very scared now and she doesn't want to go
home because she's afraid the walls will come down,'' he said.
``It's terrible and there's nothing that I can do for them because
I'm here.''

CITING HEALTH REASONS, PARCELLS WILL SKIP PRO BOWL
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Only a couple of weeks after saying that he wondered how
much he would be fined if he did not go to the Pro Bowl, New York
Jets coach Bill Parcells on Tuesday got a doctor's excuse to skip
the game. The league accepted it, and Jets assistant head coach
Bill Belichick, will run Parcells' staff at the game, which is in
Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   The game is held the Sunday after the Super Bowl and is coached
by the losing staffs in the conference championships. The day after
the Jets lost to Denver in the conference title game Jan. 17,
Parcells described himself s ``very tired'' and bemoaned pro
football's year-round workload.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells has undergone four heart procedures this decade.
According to a statement released Tuesday by the Jets, Parcells
underwent a series of medical tests last week. His cardiologist and
the club's medical director, Dr. Elliot Pellman, recommended that
he not travel to Hawaii. Commissioner Paul Tagliabue concurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``He clearly was showing the physical effects of the long
season,'' Pellman said in a statement. ``Given his medical history,
I told him that he should not travel to Hawaii and participate in
the Pro Bowl. He will remain under my care for the foreseeable
future.''
</P>
<P>
   A team official, who spoke only on condition of anonymity,
however, said that the 57-year-old Parcells' current condition
would not prevent him from returning, as he has said he plans to,
next season.

   Parcells, who is also known to dislike flying, is believed to be
the first head coach to fail to attend the Pro Bowl since it was
recast in its present state in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   During a taping of his pre-game show with Phil Simms before the
conference title game, Parcells told his former quarterback off
camera: ``If I have to coach the Pro Bowl, I'll throw up. How much
would they fine me if I didn't go?''
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's statement from the Jets, Parcells said: ``I was in
the midst of preparation for the Pro Bowl with my staff and fully
planned to carry out my obligation under the NFL guidelines. But
after undergoing a thorough medical examination, I feel it would be
a big mistake on my part not to listen to the doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This limited period of rest will rejuvenate me and allow me to
continue to carry out my duties and commitments to the Jets and to
do everything I can to improve our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick is right in step with his head coach. Just as Parcells
had done during the season, Belichick will not allow the Jets'
assistant coaches to be interviewed by the news media during Pro
Bowl week.  &QL;

WARNER-LAMBERT TO ACQUIRE AGOURON PHARMACEUTICALS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif.) (bl) 
By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Warner-Lambert Co., one of the hottest drug companies in the
industry, announced Tuesday that it would acquire Agouron
Pharmaceuticals Inc., a small San Diego biotechnology concern, for
$2.1 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   The deal enables Warner-Lambert to add Agouron's Viracept, the
nation's leading protease inhibitor, to its pipeline along with
several other anti-viral and cancer drugs. Analysts praised the
purchase, noting that it was an inexpensive way for Warner-Lambert
to bolster its drug offerings in areas where it had expertise but
few compounds ready for market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, Warner-Lambert decided that it wanted to get bigger
in the anti-cancer, anti-viral markets,'' said Neil Sweig, an
analyst with Southeast Research Partners. ``This was a good
diversification move for Warner-Lambert into several high-growth
product areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Each Agouron share will be exchanged for $60 worth of
Warner-Lambert stock, a premium of 5.6 percent based on Agouron's
last price Tuesday. In a statement issued Tuesday, Warner-Lambert
executives noted that the exchange would be tax-free and would
require the approval of Agouron's shareholders and federal
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The companies did not announce the deal until after the stock
market had closed Tuesday. However, both stocks had climbed
steadily throughout the day before being halted in afternoon
trading. Warner-Lambert's shares rose $1.625, or 2.4 percent, to
$69.125. Agouron rose $3.65625, or 6.9 percent, to $56.8125.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call Tuesday afternoon, Warner-Lambert
executives were enthusiastic about Agouron's pipeline and Viracept.
Analysts noted that Agouron was primarily a one-drug company with
Viracept contributing 87.7 percent of the company's $466.5 million
in sales for 1998, which ended in June.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Agouron transaction is not expected to lift
Warner-Lambert's earnings this year, Viracept is projected to
remain a strong seller. Sweig expects Viracept sales to increase 40
percent to 50 percent for the year ending June 30, a strong gain
for any drug.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is clear that Warner-Lambert executives are counting on
several other drugs in Agouron's pipeline to develop into top
sellers. Analysts said Tuesday that Remune, a treatment for AIDS,
and several cancer compounds, including one for small-cell lung
cancer, had already gained some interest on Wall Street. Agouron
executives said Tuesday that Remune could be on the market as early
as 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Agouron acquisition comes when Warner-Lambert's fortunes are
especially robust. Monday, the company announced that its 1998
fourth-quarter earnings had increased 45 percent, the most of any
company in the drug industry. The gain was propelled by two drugs,
Lipitor for cholesterol and Rezulin for diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, Warner-Lambert gave investors a boon
typically found in high-technology stocks: its shares rose 81.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
   However, in the last three weeks, analysts have begun to
speculate that Warner-Lambert's fortunes may be fading. Earlier
this month, an advisory committee to the Food and Drug
Administration announced that it would review Rezulin after it was
reported that 32 people taking the drug had died.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA's review of Rezulin appeared to have played no part in
the Agouron acquisition. Analysts noted Tuesday that even
profitable drug companies like Warner-Lambert are making
acquisitions to maintain strong earnings gains, which averaged 16
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``By acquiring Agouron, Warner-Lambert will receive some
immediate sales and get some interesting drugs at the same time,''
Sweig said. ``It's a good investment.''

BOEING REPORTS NEGLIGIBLE PROFIT IN 1998 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Boeing Co.'s once vaunted commercial airplane
business made a negligible profit last year while the company was
carried by the strength of its fast-growing space and defense
business.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Boeing's jetliner factories in Puget Sound are
returning to health, it will take time _ and a lot of efficiency
changes by Boeing _ before profit margins in the commercial
airplane building business improve to where they once were,
industry analysts said Tuesday after Boeing released its year-end
and fourth-quarter financial results.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, they said, the world's largest aerospace company
will make most of its money from its defense and space business,
known formally as Information Space and Defense Systems (ISDS).
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, ISDS will carry this company for the next couple of
years,'' said aerospace analyst Peter Jacobs of the Ragen MacKenzie
firm in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing delivered a record 559 commercial jets in 1998, up from
374 a year earlier, resulting in revenues of $35.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But those sales contributed only $63 million in profits for the
year, or a .2 percent profit margin, according to the financial
results released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's basically a zero profit margin,'' Jacobs noted. Boeing
has said it would like to see margins of more than 7 percent for
its commercial division.
</P>
<P>
   The star for Boeing last year was its defense and space
business.
</P>
<P>
   It contributed $1.5 billion in profits on sales of $19.9 billion
in 1998, for a much healthier 7.7 percent profit margin.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing did have a better fourth quarter than Wall Street
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing earned $465 million, or 48 cents a share, for the final
three months of 1998 compared with a loss of $498 million, or 51
cents a share, a year earlier. The 1997 loss reflected a special
charge of $876 million for commercial aircraft product lines of the
former McDonnell Douglas Corp., which Boeing acquired that year.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue for the quarter rose to $17.1 billion, up 46 percent
from $11.7 billion. The fourth-quarter results beat the average 42
cents a share estimated by analysts surveyed by First Call.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's stock fell $1 a share Tuesday, to close at $35.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was OK ... but not outstanding,'' said Nick Heymann,
analyst with Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, Boeing said it earned $1.1 billion, or $1.15 a
share, on total revenue of $56.2 billion. That was significantly
better than 1997, when charges related to jetliner production
problems resulted in a loss of $178 million, or 18 cents a share,
on revenue of $45.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   During a conference call with the media, Boeing Chairman Phil
Condit called 1998 ``challenging.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had significant problems and we met them head on and we
have achieved some significant success throughout our business
segments,'' Condit said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Boeing Commercial Airplanes started the year with
serious parts shortages, a high level of out-of-sequence jobs and a
high rate of overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We focused our efforts, made the necessary changes and now
production in the factories is much healthier,'' Condit said. Parts
shortages and out-of-sequence jobs are down to ``reasonable
levels,'' he said, though overtime remains too high.
</P>
<P>
   With fewer production line snags, Boeing is is close to
delivering all aircraft on schedule, said Alan Mulally, who was
named president of Boeing Commercial Airplanes in September after
the ouster of Ron Woodard.
</P>
<P>
   It was part of a top management shake-up at Boeing that also saw
the retirement of Boyd Givan, the company's longtime chief
financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   Givan was replaced late last year by Deborah Hopkins, who was
chief of finance for General Motors operations in Europe. She is
the highest-ranking woman executive ever at Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, she joined Condit, Mulally and other top company
executives in answering questions from the media and industry
analysts during separate morning conference calls.
</P>
<P>
   She gave her first interview for an article published Tuesday in
the Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Though she has been on the job less than two months, she was
quoted in the story as saying she wants to run Boeing after Condit
retires. She also indicated she would not mind running the
company's commercial airplane business.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about those seemingly brash statements during the media
conference call, Condit had this to say:
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to build a team that's world class. I want every
single member of this team to feel like they have the capability of
developing, of running any part of the organization. That the kind
of team I want.''
</P>
<P>
   In the media conference call, Hopkins said she is committed to
educating Boeing leaders on financial principals such as net assets
and inventory turnover.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to go down into the organization, not just the
executive branch, but all the way to the manufacturing floor. ...
to teach, to listen and to answer questions,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Educating the business team is going to go on forever. It will
be part of my own personal scorecard of how well we do. ... We will
expect improved results as people get a better handle on
understanding what their role is in contributing to the enhanced
shareholder value of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Boeing's highest priorities, she and the other executives
said, is reducing the costs of building airplanes and restoring
commercial profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name of the game is being the lowest cost producer,''
Hopkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has acknowledged that for too long the company went after
market share at the expense of profits in the heated battle with
European airplane maker Airbus Industrie. Executives have vowed
that will change and they will make a reasonable return on the
planes Boeing sells.
</P>
<P>
   But Boeing factories have not been very efficient. And becoming
more efficient will take time.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial group has forecast profit margins of from 2 to 3
percent this year, and from 1 to 3 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing already has announced plans to reduce its worldwide
employment from a high of 238,000 this year to between 185,000 and
195,000 by the end of 2000.

EDITORIAL: A HOSTAGE IN THE POLITICAL WARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Jan. 27: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Gov. George Pataki both have national
ambitions, and New York City is getting caught between them. Their
relationship got off to a spectacularly bad start when Giuliani
endorsed Mario Cuomo, the Democratic incumbent, in the 1994
gubernatorial election. The mayor has made reparations since, but
Pataki and his aides have not forgotten. Now both these Republican
politicians have political action committees aimed at raising their
profiles for 2000, and New York state hardly seems large enough for
both of them.
</P>
<P>
   The easygoing Pataki would be a more likely vice-presidential
nominee than the mayor, but he must be frustrated by Giuliani's
ability to win national attention. Giuliani seems to have lowered
his sights to the Senate seat being vacated by Daniel Patrick
Moynihan. As a senator, the mayor could pose a threat to Pataki's
control of the state party. Perhaps that is the reason for the
continued leaks from Albany suggesting other Republican
possibilities for the Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   Since Pataki was re-elected last year he has approved several
legislative initiatives the mayor opposed, including a law that
puts the city at a disadvantage in negotiations with the police
union. Giuliani then surprised the governor by announcing that he
wanted to build a football stadium on land Pataki controls on
Manhattan's West Side. The football plan stole all the thunder from
the governor's State-of-the-State address.
</P>
<P>
   Now Pataki has surprised the mayor with plans for a major
investigation of the city's Board of Education and School
Construction Authority. Given the fact that Pataki appoints one of
the three trustees who run the Construction Authority, and that he
has shown no particular interest in its operations in the past, it
seems reasonable to ask about his motives. A recent report,
co-written by Giuliani's own Department of Investigation, found
that the governor's last appointee broke the authority's rules to
get a job for the husband of an aide. The hiring became an issue in
mismanagement that led to the death of a young girl in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Construction Authority and the school system are
much-investigated organizations that are being managed better now
than in the past. They seem to need stability more than a lengthy
inquiry that will distract the top management from its normal
duties. Critics have a right to question whether Pataki is trying
to cover his own embarrassment over his trustee's performance and
to avoid giving more aid to the city's needy schools. Giuliani,
meanwhile, should try working together with the governor on
developing Manhattan's West Side. It is a long time until the 2000
elections, and New York City cannot afford to spend it as the
captive of dueling politicians.

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Jan. 27: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you watch televised golf, you have either hit the wrong
button on the remote or you are part of an audience with plans, as
Bernard Darwin once put it, of ``drinking into our own disjointed
system(s) the rhythm of a great player.'' Golf differs from most
other sports in that respect. Virtually none of the Super Bowl
spectators this coming Sunday will be wondering what John Elway can
teach them about releasing a pass. But many people who watch golf
are actually golfers, and they keenly appreciate the virtuosity of
players excelling at a game whose difficulty seems to vanish when
seen through the foreshortening lens of a TV camera.
</P>
<P>
   Golf's difficulty also seems to vanish when David Duval, who is
27, plays it. He has won nine tournaments since 1997. He is the
hottest golfer since Tom Watson in 1980. Last Sunday, to win the
Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, Duval shot a final round of 59. Only two
other men have shot 59 in the 82-year history of PGA competition.
Duval's is the only 59 ever shot on a tournament Sunday, a day when
even the coolest player _ and Duval is a cool one _ discovers he
has nerves.
</P>
<P>
   How great is a 59? It is a little like taking Mark McGwire's 70
home-run swings this past season and putting them back to back in
70 at-bats. Each of Duval's shots on Sunday, from his first drive
to his final putt, was a home run. After the tournament, one
interviewer tried to pry some secret from Duval _ something unusual
about his dreams, something different about his breakfast, anything
that would make it easier for fellow golfers to believe he has some
unattainable mojo working.
</P>
<P>
   But the place Duval is playing from cannot really be explained.
He seems to understand that there is no accounting for it. He says
that when he shoots a 63, he gets ``some wild hair out there.''
That is not much of a clue for the rest of us to go by.

By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
MIAMI _ Atlanta has four players with Super Bowl experience: safety
Randy Fuller (Pittsburgh), safety Eugene Robinson (Green Bay),
receiver Tony Martin (San Diego) and linebacker Cornelius Bennett
(Buffalo).
<TEXT>
<P>
   However, only Robinson is giving his teammates advice on how to
win the game. The other players and coach Dan Reeves (three losses
with Denver) have bad memories from their Super Bowl experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, meanwhile, is trying to find the right formula to get
his team to play a competitive game. His three previous teams lost
by the combined score of 136-40.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lost three times, and I've changed the way we prepared
every year,'' Reeves said. ``So I've tried every way you can. All
I'm asking is that our football team play well for four quarters in
all phases of the game and then see who wins the thing.'' From
birds to dogs The dirty-bird dancing Falcons officially went to the
dogs yesterday; cornerback Ray Buchanan stole the show at media day
by wearing a dog collar.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's explanation: ``I'm doing this for fun. People have us
as seven-point underdogs, so I thought I would put on my dog
collar.''
</P>
<P>
   Though teammates didn't follow Buchanan's lead, they seem to be
of the same mind-set.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been the underdog from day one,'' Archambeau said.
``From the start of the season right through the NFC Championship
Game, we have been the underdog. That's fine. It doesn't matter
what you are going into the game, only what you are coming out of
the game. We are going to come out on top of this one.'' Not the
same 14-2 The Broncos and Falcons both were 14-2 in the regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   However, Reeves said the records are deceiving and that the
Broncos' 14-2 is better.
</P>
<P>
   His reasoning is that the Broncos earned their record with
pressure of having the target of Super Bowl champion on their back,
while the Falcons snuck up on some people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Broncos are the best team in football,'' Reeves said.
``This is a team that has the same record as we do, but it's a
totally different record. A lot of people didn't even get up for
us. That's never true with defending world champions. They went out
with all the pressures and responded to every challenge.'' DeBerg
plans return Those who thought Steve DeBerg's comeback was a
one-year thing should think again.
</P>
<P>
   The 45-year-old quarterback, who came out of retirement because
the Falcons wanted a veteran backup, has no plans to retire again.
</P>
<P>
   ``In July, I plan to try to make a football team,'' DeBerg said.
``I really think my concept _ coming into this situation and
contribute as a backup quarterback _ is valid. I think I proved
that. I'd like to try and do it again.''

 DENVER'S SHANAHAN ASKS A LOT OF, GIVES A
LOT TO PLAYERS (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) By KEVIN
LYONS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Start with the travel accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   First-class hotels, and everybody gets his own room, from the
millionaire superstars to the lower-waged veterans. Even rookies.
</P>
<P>
   Meals are free. And so is Spectravision.
</P>
<P>
   Players for the Denver Broncos must wonder sometimes if they are
royalty, or if they are on a road trip to play a football game.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth-year Broncos coach Mike Shanahan would like to think that
one has to do with the other. When you feel good, you play good.
And there is certainly no doubting how good the Broncos have
played. With a victory against the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl
XXXIII on Sunday, the Broncos would set a league record with 46
victories the past three years. More important, they would become
the sixth team in NFL history to repeat as Super Bowl champions.
</P>
<P>
   During this remarkable run, Shanahan _ a carefree man who rides
a Harley and likes to bungee jump and scuba dive _ has been the
team's stern taskmaster and its chauffeur. One minute he may pull a
veteran into his office to grill him for goofing off in practice;
the next minute he's inviting the same veteran to his
8,000-square-foot home for casino night, which he holds once a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in doing the little things and doing them right
because we expect so much from our players,'' Shanahan said.
``That's why we buy them breakfast, lunch and all of the other
stuff. In return, when the game is on the line and you ask them to
do something they might not normally want to do, they'll do it for
you because they know you care about them, because we're all out
for the ultimate goal, and that's to win a championship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike is more than just a players' coach because players'
coaches may get too close to the players and not do what's best for
the team,'' cornerback Ray Crockett said. ``Mike just wants to make
it as comfortable as possible when you come to work. He told us
from Day One, `If there is anything you guys need to make you do
better and feel better when you're at work, that's what I'm going
to try to do.'
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the incentives, the perks. If we win, the next two
days we can come in and work out on our own time, and the next
Friday we don't have to wear helmets to practice. We call it hat
day. When we were 13-0 and went to play the Giants, the thing we
were concerned about was not that we'd lost, but that man, `We
messed up hat day.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Before Spectravision and hat day, Shanahan was a scrawny,
150-pounder at Eastern Illinois where his dreams of becoming a
wishbone quarterback ended before they started. In the school's
annual spring game in 1973, he was hit hard in the back. He went
home, got sick, then was rushed to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors had to remove a kidney.
</P>
<P>
   To stay in football, Shanahan, now 46, got into coaching. Barry
Switzer gave him his first coaching job, working with running backs
at Oklahoma in 1975-76. Shanahan spent time as an offensive
coordinator at his alma mater and Minnesota and Florida before Dan
Reeves hired him as the Broncos' quarterbacks coach in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The stormy relationship between Reeves and Shanahan might be the
talk of Super Bowl week. But back then, Reeves thought Shanahan was
one of the brightest young offensive minds around.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had area scouts, and when they would come in every year for
the draft, I would ask them to list their top coaches in the
area,'' Reeves told the ``Denver Rocky Mountain News''. ``Mike was
one of those coaches that was on the top of the list of the scouts
in the Southeast. I called him in, and he was extremely impressive.
In fact, I hired him immediately when I talked to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Shanahan was fired twice before he started his run of
success; after going 8-12 as the Los Angeles Raiders' head coach,
and after his feud with Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   As the Broncos' head coach, Shanahan referred to his days as the
San Francisco 49ers' offensive coordinator (1992-94) as his guide.
He took the Bill Walsh way of offense and added his intricacies,
with more motion and more formations. He didn't just script the
first 15 plays. He scripted every minute of training camp, down to
the last minute. He even scripted some of the speeches he used
before regular-season and playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   His organization has carried over to the playing field. The
Broncos have finished among the NFL's top five in total offense in
each of Shanahan's four seasons as head coach. In 1998, the John
Elway-Terrell Davis-led unit scored a team-record 501 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got so much confidence in Mike,'' Elway said. ``He's got
a great mind, and he knows football better than anyone I've ever
seen. And he's been good with me. If there is something in the game
plan that I really don't like and I tell him, he won't call it'' in
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Mike is similar to Bill Walsh and George Seifert in
that the attention to detail for this football club is superior,''
said Broncos linebacker Bill Romanowski, who played for the 49ers
from 1988-93.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a perfectionist.''

SHANAHAN IS TASKMASTER, GIFT GIVER

MIAMI _ Start with the travel accommodations.
<TEXT>
<P>
   First-class hotels, and everybody gets his own room, from the
millionaire superstars to the lower-waged veterans. Even rookies.
</P>
<P>
   Meals are free. And so is Spectravision.
</P>
<P>
   Players for the Denver Broncos must wonder sometimes if they are
royalty, or if they are on a road trip to play a football game.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth-year Broncos coach Mike Shanahan would like to think that
one has to do with the other. When you feel good, you play good.
And there is certainly no doubting how good the Broncos have
played. With a victory against the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl
XXXIII on Sunday, the Broncos would set a league record with 46
victories the past three years. More important, they would become
the sixth team in NFL history to repeat as Super Bowl champions.
</P>
<P>
   During this remarkable run, Shanahan _ a carefree man who rides
a Harley and likes to bungee jump and scuba dive _ has been the
team's stern taskmaster and its chauffeur. One minute he may pull a
veteran into his office to grill him for goofing off in practice;
the next minute he's inviting the same veteran to his
8,000-square-foot home for casino night, which he holds once a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in doing the little things and doing them right
because we expect so much from our players,'' Shanahan said.
``That's why we buy them breakfast, lunch and all of the other
stuff. In return, when the game is on the line and you ask them to
do something they might not normally want to do, they'll do it for
you because they know you care about them, because we're all out
for the ultimate goal, and that's to win a championship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike is more than just a players' coach because players'
coaches may get too close to the players and not do what's best for
the team,'' cornerback Ray Crockett said. ``Mike just wants to make

STARS NOT WORRIED ABOUT BURNOUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ A hockey team can burn out during an 82-game
regular season.
</P>
<P>
   But Stars players insist they're not going to be that team.
</P>
<P>
   With 39 games remaining and coach Ken Hitchcock calling for more
emotion from his team, the Stars addressed the theory of saving
something for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A team can burn out; I've seen it happen before,'' center Guy
Carbonneau said. ``But this is a team that's built not to have that
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars captain Derian Hatcher said Hitchcock's drive for
intensity throughout the season won't be the Stars' downfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's hard, but I don't think he's too hard,'' Hatcher said.
``He gives us plenty of days off, and we have to make use of those.
You can burn out, but I think we do a lot of things to prevent that
from happening.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars often are compared to the Detroit Red Wings in their
ascent toward a potential Stanley Cup. The Red Wings won three
consecutive divisional titles from 1993-96, including two
Presidents' Trophies for best record in the NHL. But they didn't
win the Stanley Cup until they finished fifth overall in 1996-97
then cruised through the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Detroit did that, but we're not them,'' Hatcher said. ``Last
year is a good example. We didn't lose in the playoffs because of
burnout; we lost because of injuries and some other problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock drove the Stars hard from the opening whistle last
season when they won the Presidents' Trophy and the top seed in the
playoffs. He said the Stars had plenty of energy all the way
through the Western Conference Finals, where the Stars lost to the
Red Wings in six games.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's asking for the players to put their foot on the gas
once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to have raw emotion in our game; it's as simple as
that,'' Hitchcock said. ``Our game is pressure and pursuit, and you
have to have emotion to play that game. When we were winding down
to the break, we didn't have that emotion and we didn't play well.
Now, since we're well-rested, we need to get that raw emotion
back.''
</P>
<P>
   But isn't the first half an indication of why the Stars have to
pace themselves? They played 43 games, hit a high point with a
15-game unbeaten streak in December and early January then
staggered into the break at 2-4-1, seemingly exhausted. They can
blame a tough road schedule in December, but they face the same
hurdle in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to us before the break is I think we had more
troubles mentally than we did physically,'' Hatcher said. ``When
you go 15 games without losing, you start to believe you can't
lose, no matter what you do. So you don't take the games as
seriously, and bad habits start to creep in.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think we learned from that, and I think it's just
another thing we'll be able to use this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Carbonneau said the Stars' team system helps protect them from
burnout.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look, we have four lines and six defensemen and
that's why we won't wear down,'' he said. ``Even the players we do
have that play a lot don't play near as much as the top guys in the
league. So I think that helps keep us fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher leads the Stars in ice time at approximately 24 minutes
per game, ranking him 28th in the NHL. Mike Modano is the most-used
Stars forward, averaging 20:45 per game, 99th in the league.
</P>
<P>
   And if the frequent rest and balanced play isn't enough, veteran
Brian Skrudland said individual motivation can go a long way in
keeping the team from burning out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at our team, all of us are hungry. The guys who
are getting 10 minutes want 15 and the guys who are getting 15
minutes want 20,'' Skrudland said. ``I think we'll be a very hungry
team when the playoffs come, because that's who we are. We all want
\Rthe Stanley Cup\S, and that's what it's all about. We want it
now, and we're going to want it even more then.''

PRO BOWLERS LACK FLAIR OF YESTERYEAR'S STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAULA CABALLERO 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Pro bowler Carmen Salvino moved like a dancer on the
approach, gyrating at the foul line, putting a little body English
on the ball, the pins. With his pants pitched up in vintage-Salvino
fashion, he engaged the crowd while keeping people at home glued to
ABC on Saturday afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   Salvino and other stars of the 1950s and '60s such as Dick
Weber, Harry Smith, Billy Hardwick and Don Carter sold the game to
fans as not just bowling but entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't start bowling for the bowling itself. I did it
because they looked like they were having fun on TV,'' said
Marshall Holman, bowling Hall of Famer and current Professional
Bowlers Assocication tour broadcaster. ``That's what drew me to the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Pro bowling might never see another Salvino and the television
exposure that went with his era. But the tour does not lack for
marquee attractions, such as Walter Ray Williams Jr., or
up-and-comers, like 1998 rookie of the year Chris Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   The talent is on display this week at the Don Carter PBA
Classic. Qualifying competition begins today at Don Carter's All
Star Lanes-West in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The guy to root for and against might be one and the same:
Williams. He has been so dominant, some fans can't help but want to
see him lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are a lot of people who want to beat Walter Ray,
and there are probably a lot watching who want to see people beat
Walter Ray,'' Barnes said. ``It's the same with everyone who has
success. People want to see them knocked down a notch.''
</P>
<P>
   Other fans root for him because he's simply the most dominant
player in the game. He was recently selected PBA player of the
year, the third consecutive year he has won the honor, and has
earned more total money than any player in PBA history. He was
inducted into the PBA Hall of Fame in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes Walter great is the ability to understand what the
lane is looking for,'' Holman said. ``He can make the adjustment in
the least amount of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams entertains with his mesmerizing skill. Although he has
become more demonstrative as his career has progressed, he is not
apt to show the kind of enthusiasm fellow PBA Hall of Famer Brian
Voss does. Voss seems to exude charisma paired with intensity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems to thrive in that environment,'' Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Weber is another player who is likely to let fans see his
emotions _ bad or good. Holman, the bad boy of his era, said he
sees a comparison between him and Weber.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very excitable and gets very angry,'' Holman said. ``I
joke with Pete and tell him he's the new me.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker Bohn III and David Ozio also rank high as fan favorites.
Bohn, a left-hander, impresses with his silky smooth game. Ozio
gets the crowd going.
</P>
<P>
   ``He yells, but it's never vicious,'' said Fort Worth bowling
pro Susie Minshew. ``He shows you, `I'm excited about my stuff' but
not `Nyah-nyah-nee-nyah-nyah.'''
</P>
<P>
   The stars of the past, however, are more compelling to some.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lot looser back then,'' said Joe Doctor of Arlington,
who runs the Dallas/Fort Worth National Amateur Bowlers Inc.
tournaments. ``Every competitor seemed a lot looser. Now it's a
more serious game. I understand they're making a living, so it has
to be serious, but it seems like some take it too seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   There are reasons why fans might not see the ``looseness'' of a
Salvino on the lanes these days. Salvino and several of his peers
owned bowling centers or pro shops, creating a second source of
income. Today, many of the bowlers use tour earnings as their sole
source of income.
</P>
<P>
   The game itself has also become far more complicated and
technical, mostly because of new equipment. In the past, a pro
could arrive at a tournament armed with one or two rubber bowling
balls.Today a pro has 10 to 15 reactive resin balls.
</P>
<P>
   Although reactive resin balls might hook and hit harder, unlike
rubber balls, they also eat up lane oil, which results in constant
adjustment from shot to shot. Unlike the golfer who can see the
bunkers and the undulations of the greens, the bowler cannot see
the changes in lane conditions until the ball reacts to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just move two boards left with your feet,'' PBA
assistant tournament director Damon Sarrocco said. ``Now, you need
to jump left, change the ball, change the angle, change the speed,
change four or five different things.''
</P>
<P>
   More decisions, more choices _ more at stake.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps in time, a new showman will be born.
</P>
<P>
   ``As some of the younger players make TV, I think they'll get
into that environment, that part of the game,'' Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I will.''

   NEW YORK _ When Adam Kasanof arrived on the campus of Columbia
University, he was a budding Latin scholar, a fan of Catullus, a
student of declensions and dactylic hexameter who was there to
pursue the life of the mind.
</P>
<P>
   But when he returned to the Ivy League campus as an alumnus
seven years later, it was not as a doctor, or a physicist, or a
Nobel laureate in literature.
</P>
<P>
   He came back as a cop, a police officer from the 26th Precinct,
there to help an emotionally disturbed woman perched atop a stone
wall who was yelling ``Dead white meat'' at anyone who approached.
</P>
<P>
   Kasanof, class of 1981, is the first to admit that this sort of
endeavor was not promoted in the catalog for Columbia, which has
little history as a finishing school for New York's Finest.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my college instructors actually said when he found out
I was going to the Police Department that I was a saintly madman,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kasanof is certainly unusual _ not everyone can score 1410 on
the SAT _ but he is not alone in forsaking the status and wealth
that prestigious degrees can yield for the modest salary and
multiple perils of a career as a New York City police officer.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bronx, there is a plainclothes narcotics officer who went
to Harvard. In Queens, there is a sergeant who graduated from
Cornell. In Brooklyn, the commander of the 67th Precinct detective
squad joined the force after earning a master's degree from New
York University. In northern Manhattan, Officer Christopher
Schmidt, who graduated from Columbia in 1993 with a 3.4 grade point
average, works the night shift riding in a radio car.
</P>
<P>
   These officers with elite degrees can find themselves astride
two worlds _ their police careers at odds with the conventions of a
first-class college, and their educational pedigrees often viewed
as eccentric in the station house. ``Some people think you are
nuts,'' said Sgt. Andrew Hatki, a 1989 Cornell graduate who joined
the force in 1992. ``They don't understand. They say, `With that
kind of education?' They think you are wasting it. But I don't feel
that way. I feel like I'm doing what I want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department does not record where all of its officers
attended college, but officials estimate that a few dozen have
joined the force after studying at elite universities. Several of
these officers acknowledged in interviews that their choice of
police work, at first glance, might seem odd, but they said they
were attracted by the same sort of incentives that lure other
recruits: adventure, hefty pensions, lofty ideals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to sound corny,'' said Schmidt, ``but I always liked
helping people and this is a real helping-people job.''
</P>
<P>
   David Durk appealed to the social conscience of the
well-educated three decades ago when he showed up on Ivy League
campuses, a whistle-blowing New York police lieutenant in the midst
of unearthing a major corruption scandal. He told students that if
they really wanted change, they should drop the ``Pig'' chants and
take the police test. Many did. But Durk, an Amherst College
graduate, said the department never pushed to enroll these
candidates. ``They told me I was a starry-eyed idealist,'' he said.
``Later on they acknowledged they were not going to let these
people in, because they were going to be troublemakers.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the department seems more in touch with its academic
side. Since 1995, recruits have been required to have two years of
college or two years of military service. Candidates for captain
must have a four-year degree. Although no one is about to confuse
the department with Cambridge, some 7,350 officers, about one-fifth
of the force, now hold college degrees. Another 535 have advanced
degrees, like a law degree.
</P>
<P>
   But very few were educated in the Ivy League, where the career
orientation is decidedly white-collar and the political ethos can
be considerably left of center. Indeed, one of the darkest moments
in Columbia history is the bloody day in 1968 when administrators
called in the police to sweep the campus of a student rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Kasanof, who returned to Columbia to get his law degree in 1988,
said that while his friends supported his interest in a
law-enforcement career, some fellow undergraduates carried a
misconception that ``the people who work in the Police Department
are basically all Philistines, brutes, idiots, or that they do
something that is essentially undesirable and that is oppress
people or act as an occupying army.''
</P>
<P>
   The climate is more balanced today, said Capt. William Gorta,
who earned his bachelor's degree at Columbia in 1995, while working
as a police officer. ``Maybe they were surprised to find an egghead
with a shield,'' he said of his Ivy League classmates, ``but I
never heard a snide remark.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although few officers express regret about the decision they
made, their families can be another story. Officer Edward Conlon,
who pursues drug dealers in the Bronx and writes about police
matters for The New Yorker, has said he believes his late father,
who was an FBI agent, would have disapproved of his decision to
join the police after graduation from Harvard in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Rosendo Velez, Columbia class of 1984, said his father, a
grocer on the Lower East Side, was initially disappointed by his
choice. ``I was supposed to be the doctor in the family,'' he said.
But a chance encounter with a retired detective, who photographed
his wedding and proselytized about the nobility of police work,
convinced the young graduate to return, as a police officer, to the
mean streets his family had hoped he would escape. He has
questioned the decision only once.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first night, I had to take my gun out three times,'' he
said. ``I said to my wife when I got home, `What the heck am I
doing here?'''
</P>
<P>
   When they are finished assuaging their families, some highly
educated officers have to confront the stereotype that someone
acute enough to have attended an Ivy League school would be obtuse
patrolling the streets of New York. Though many of these officers
are savvy city natives and physically fit, there is sometimes a
lingering sentiment in station houses that what an officer needs to
know cannot be found in any book.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone seems overly academic, there is an inclination to
question whether they can handle themselves in a street
condition,'' said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police
Executive Research Forum, a research group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Velez said he occasionally feels that he must ``let people know
that before I got promoted, I did my share of street work and made
my share of arrests.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Kasanof, the cerebral Latin major, showed he was
much more than a student of an ancient language in 1984, when he
shot and killed a mugger who tried to rob him on a Manhattan subway
train.
</P>
<P>
   Although they have given up a lot in terms of wealth, status and
even safety for their law-enforcement careers, the officers said
they found that they were often envied by their college classmates
as people of action who are not shackled to a desk, and were
prodded at parties to detail their derring-do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you are talking to a kindergarten class or a group of
Columbia professors,'' said Gorta, ``they always ask the same two
questions. One, `Do you have a gun?' And two, `Have you ever shot
anyone?'''

STARS SAYS THEY CAN MAINTAIN INTENSITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
IRVING, Texas _ A hockey team can burn out during an 82-game
regular season.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But Stars players insist they're not going to be that team.
</P>
<P>
   With 39 games remaining and coach Ken Hitchcock calling for more
emotion from his team, the Stars addressed the theory of saving
something for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A team can burn out; I've seen it happen before,'' center Guy
Carbonneau said. ``But this is a team that's built not to have that
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars captain Derian Hatcher said Hitchcock's drive for
intensity throughout the season won't be the Stars' downfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's hard, but I don't think he's too hard,'' Hatcher said.
``He gives us plenty of days off, and we have to make use of those.
You can burn out, but I think we do a lot of things to prevent that
from happening.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars often are compared to the Detroit Red Wings in their
ascent toward a potential Stanley Cup. The Red Wings won three
consecutive divisional titles from 1993-96, including two
Presidents' Trophies for best record in the NHL. But they didn't
win the Stanley Cup until they finished fifth overall in 1996-97
then cruised through the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Detroit did that, but we're not them,'' Hatcher said. ``Last
year is a good example. We didn't lose in the playoffs because of
burnout; we lost because of injuries and some other problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock drove the Stars hard from the opening whistle last
season when they won the Presidents' Trophy and the top seed in the
playoffs. He said the Stars had plenty of energy all the way
through the Western Conference Finals, where the Stars lost to the
Red Wings in six games.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's asking for the players to put their foot on the gas
once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to have raw emotion in our game; it's as simple as
that,'' Hitchcock said. ``Our game is pressure and pursuit, and you
have to have emotion to play that game. When we were winding down
to the break, we didn't have that emotion and we didn't play well.
Now, since we're well-rested, we need to get that raw emotion
back.''
</P>
<P>
   But isn't the first half an indication of why the Stars have to
pace themselves? They played 43 games, hit a high point with a
15-game unbeaten streak in December and early January then
staggered into the break at 2-4-1, seemingly exhausted. They can
blame a tough road schedule in December, but they face the same
hurdle in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to us before the break is I think we had more
troubles mentally than we did physically,'' Hatcher said. ``When
you go 15 games without losing, you start to believe you can't
lose, no matter what you do. So you don't take the games as
seriously, and bad habits start to creep in.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think we learned from that, and I think it's just
another thing we'll be able to use this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Carbonneau said the Stars' team system helps protect them from
burnout.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look, we have four lines and six defensemen and
that's why we won't wear down,'' he said. ``Even the players we do
have that play a lot don't play near as much as the top guys in the
league. So I think that helps keep us fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher leads the Stars in ice time at approximately 24 minutes
per game, ranking him 28th in the NHL. Mike Modano is the most-used
Stars forward, averaging 20:45 per game, 99th in the league.
</P>
<P>
   And if the frequent rest and balanced play isn't enough, veteran
Brian Skrudland said individual motivation can go a long way in
keeping the team from burning out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at our team, all of us are hungry. The guys who
are getting 10 minutes want 15 and the guys who are getting 15
minutes want 20,'' Skrudland said. ``I think we'll be a very hungry
team when the playoffs come, because that's who we are. We all want
\Rthe Stanley Cup\S, and that's what it's all about. We want it
now, and we're going to want it even more then.''

SPORTS COLUMN: FOR MARTIN, NEW TEAM, SAME GOAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Four years ago, Tony Martin and I were on the same
wavelength in this very same city at this very same stadium. Martin
was with San Diego; the Chargers were playing the San Francisco
49ers in Super Bowl XXIX.
</P>
<P>
   As a staunch fan of the old American Football League, I picked
San Diego to win, more from emotion than intellect. Martin, being a
San Diego Charger, felt the Chargers could win.
</P>
<P>
   Three plays into the game, Martin and I had the same sinking
feeling. Jerry Rice scored on 50-yard touchdown, and I looked at
the person next to me and shook my head. Martin was sitting on the
Chargers' bench. ``I remember looking at Shawn Jefferson and
saying, `This is going to be a long day,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A long day, indeed. When the nightmare ended, San Diego was
routed, 49-26.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, both of us are back _ same city, same stadium
_ but Martin is on a different team. Last June the Chargers traded
Martin to Atlanta; this week he is attempting to make sure the
Falcons are on a different wavelength, prepping them, as much as he
can, for what to expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them they have to be focused from the starting
lineups,'' Martin said, looking over his shoulder at the Pro Player
Stadium field.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I told them that there's going to be fireworks and
all that. Even the halftime show. I told them during the halftime
show they're going to sit in the locker room for 30, 40 minutes.
You got to warm back up again. During the regular season, as soon
as you go to the locker room, it's time to go back out. But they're
going to have to experience it for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Atlanta is experiencing something the organization
may never have thought would happen. In making its first Super Bowl
appearance, the franchise made one of the most dramatic turnabouts
in National Football League history. Martin, 33, has played a
resounding role in Atlanta's transformation. He has given the
Falcons a deep threat, and he is a feared receiver who is
acknowledged as one of the most precise runners of routes in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   In nine NFL seasons, the Miami-born Martin has refused to be
denied, and he has made himself into a star. ``I was going to make
it in the league,'' he said. ``It was a matter of who had the
patience.''
</P>
<P>
   The mantra for Martin and the Falcons is: time and patience.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was a quarterback at Mesa College in Colorado. The Jets,
coached by Joe Walton, drafted him in the fifth round, converted
him to a receiver, then cut him. Martin was picked up by the Miami
Dolphins, who put him on their developmental squad. In four years
with Miami, Martin played in all 16 games each season, starting at
least five games. In 1994, he was traded to San Diego, where he
blossomed into one of the NFL's most well-rounded receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Martin led the team in receptions, receiving yards
and touchdowns. But Martin and Chargers Coach Kevin Gilbride did
not get along. A trade was arranged with Atlanta, with Gilbride
apparently thinking he was sending Martin to an official NFL
wasteland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't see eye to eye for whatever reason,'' Martin said of
Gilbride. ``He said I couldn't get off the bump-and-run coverage,
and that other guys were having better camps than me. That was
ludicrous. Anyway, that was his opinion; the Chargers listened to
him, and now he's not there.''
</P>
<P>
   More revealing than anything Martin says about himself is what
teammates say about him. Terance Mathis, another former Jet, was
Atlanta's primary receiver the last four seasons but needed another
half. Martin has been it.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis is recovering from a drinking problem, and he said Martin
had been an immeasurable help. Mathis said when his energy was low
in a game, Martin would pat him on the back and pick him up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was my roommate in training camp; we talked about a lot of
things,'' Mathis said. ``The only thing he talked about was getting
back to the Super Bowl and being successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathis said Martin talked about how San Diego treated him.
``Tony has overcome some things off the field also,'' Mathis said,
``but he hasn't let that affect him on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Buchanan, the Falcons' cornerback, said that Martin was
``tough as nails.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't let Tony Martin fool you,'' Buchanan said. ``They say
he's a smooth dresser, how laid back he is. When he gets out on
that football field, he's an animal.''
</P>
<P>
   So this is homecoming week for Tony Martin. He was born here in
1965, attended high school here and, for four seasons, played pro
ball here.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's back in the Super Bowl for the second time in five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredible,'' he said. ``I pinch myself every morning
that I'm playing in the Super Bowl, again, in Miami. That has to be
a record.''

IN PBA, TECHNICIANS HAVE REPLACED SHOWMEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAULA CABALLERO 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
Paula Caballero DALLAS _ Pro bowler Carmen Salvino moved like a
dancer on the approach, gyrating at the foul line, putting a little
body English on the ball, the pins. With his pants pitched up in
vintage-Salvino fashion, he engaged the crowd while keeping people
at home glued to ABC on Saturday afternoons.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Salvino and other stars of the 1950s and '60s such as Dick
Weber, Harry Smith, Billy Hardwick and Don Carter sold the game to
fans as not just bowling but entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't start bowling for the bowling itself. I did it
because they looked like they were having fun on TV,'' said
Marshall Holman, bowling Hall of Famer and current Professional
Bowlers Assocication tour broadcaster. ``That's what drew me to the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Pro bowling might never see another Salvino and the television
exposure that went with his era. But the tour does not lack for
marquee attractions, such as Walter Ray Williams Jr., or
up-and-comers, like 1998 rookie of the year Chris Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   The talent is on display this week at the Don Carter PBA
Classic. Qualifying competition begins today at Don Carter's All
Star Lanes-West in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The guy to root for and against might be one and the same:
Williams. He has been so dominant, some fans can't help but want to
see him lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are a lot of people who want to beat Walter Ray,
and there are probably a lot watching who want to see people beat
Walter Ray,'' Barnes said. ``It's the same with everyone who has
success. People want to see them knocked down a notch.''
</P>
<P>
   Other fans root for him because he's simply the most dominant
player in the game. He was recently selected PBA player of the
year, the third consecutive year he has won the honor, and has
earned more total money than any player in PBA history. He was
inducted into the PBA Hall of Fame in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes Walter great is the ability to understand what the
lane is looking for,'' Holman said. ``He can make the adjustment in
the least amount of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams entertains with his mesmerizing skill. Although he has
become more demonstrative as his career has progressed, he is not
apt to show the kind of enthusiasm fellow PBA Hall of Famer Brian
Voss does. Voss seems to exude charisma paired with intensity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems to thrive in that environment,'' Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Weber is another player who is likely to let fans see his
emotions _ bad or good. Holman, the bad boy of his era, said he
sees a comparison between him and Weber.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very excitable and gets very angry,'' Holman said. ``I
joke with Pete and tell him he's the new me.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker Bohn III and David Ozio also rank high as fan favorites.
Bohn, a left-hander, impresses with his silky smooth game. Ozio
gets the crowd going.
</P>
<P>
   ``He yells, but it's never vicious,'' said Fort Worth bowling
pro Susie Minshew. ``He shows you, `I'm excited about my stuff' but
not `Nyah-nyah-nee-nyah-nyah.'''
</P>
<P>
   The stars of the past, however, are more compelling to some.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lot looser back then,'' said Joe Doctor of Arlington,
who runs the Dallas/Fort Worth National Amateur Bowlers Inc.
tournaments. ``Every competitor seemed a lot looser. Now it's a
more serious game. I understand they're making a living, so it has
to be serious, but it seems like some take it too seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   There are reasons why fans might not see the ``looseness'' of a
Salvino on the lanes these days. Salvino and several of his peers
owned bowling centers or pro shops, creating a second source of
income. Today, many of the bowlers use tour earnings as their sole
source of income.
</P>
<P>
   The game itself has also become far more complicated and
technical, mostly because of new equipment. In the past, a pro
could arrive at a tournament armed with one or two rubber bowling
balls.Today a pro has 10 to 15 reactive resin balls.
</P>
<P>
   Although reactive resin balls might hook and hit harder, unlike
rubber balls, they also eat up lane oil, which results in constant
adjustment from shot to shot. Unlike the golfer who can see the
bunkers and the undulations of the greens, the bowler cannot see
the changes in lane conditions until the ball reacts to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just move two boards left with your feet,'' PBA
assistant tournament director Damon Sarrocco said. ``Now, you need
to jump left, change the ball, change the angle, change the speed,
change four or five different things.''
</P>
<P>
   More decisions, more choices _ more at stake.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps in time, a new showman will be born.
</P>
<P>
   ``As some of the younger players make TV, I think they'll get
into that environment, that part of the game,'' Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I will.'' \Ntagtop:Paula Caballero, (817) 685-3863

AN INSPIRATION COMPOUNDED OF HANDS AND FEET  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 31) 
</HEADLINE>
   Ann Daly teaches performance studies at the University of Texas at
Austin  
 (af)  
 By ANN DALY 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imogen Cunningham photographed Martha Graham in the summer of
1931, in Santa Barbara, Calif. They worked outside, in front of the
barn at Graham's mother's home. The afternoon was hot, the smell
unpleasant and the flies bothersome, but together they managed to
produce a collection of nearly 90 images, an extraordinary
double-portrait of both photographer and choreographer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The new acquaintances were well matched. Graham, 37, stood at
the forefront of the modern-dance movement back in New York.
Cunningham, 48, one of the most important experimental
photographers on the West Coast, was given her first retrospective
exhibition later that year, at the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum in
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The work of both artists was marked by clarity and simplicity
and the afterglow of a youthful lyricism. What Graham had to say
about modern dance applied as well to Cunningham's photography:
``It is not `pretty,' but it is much more real.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By the time she met Graham, Cunningham had shifted her focus
from plants to body parts, especially artists' and musicians'
hands. Both vegetation and human form were rendered so literally as
to become abstract, and poetic. Her portraits of Graham's hands and
feet retain a palpable sense of the organic, even though they are
severely cropped and composed.
</P>
<P>
   The picture frame functions for its interior space much as
Graham's masklike face heightened the expressiveness of her body.
There is something quite poignant in the way these hands and feet
converse, echoing each other in lines and triangles.
</P>
<P>
   Shape, Cunningham observed, is the photographer's only means of
empathy. And to animate those shapes, she often used natural light;
Graham's skin is touchable, and her toes graspable. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Graham, the feet and hands were neither to be ignored nor
wasted on decoration. They were an integral component of the
tensile body structure that she was in the process of building:
flexed feet that pressed the ground and cupped hands that pressed
the air. ``Think of what a wonderful thing the hand is,'' she said,
``and what vast potentialities of movement it has as a hand and not
as a poor imitation of something else.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The feet were to function as sensitively as hands, able to
apprehend all the minute adjustments made throughout the body
during even the simplest shift of weight when walking. ``Primitive
Mysteries,'' immediately acknowledged as a masterpiece after its
premiere in February 1931, was based on a walk.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's group had investigated this fundamental movement for
months and even visited Jones Beach on Long Island to press their
feet into the surf. Graham's technique required a complete
articulation of the foot; all of its bones must move, she said.
Cunningham understood the preternatural strength and flexibility of
those feet and made monuments of them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In those early years, Graham's now-famous contraction and
release was not confined to the torso. The hands and feet, she
insisted, must respond as well. This relationship was activated in
the warm-up to her technique class, which had been largely codified
by 1929-30. Cunningham's photos suggest this first sitting
position.
</P>
<P>
   Graham made little use of these photographs, which are held by
the Cunningham Trust in Berkeley, Calif., and can be seen by
appointment at Photography: The Platinum Gallery in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Today, we identify Graham with the later repertory pictures by
Barbara Morgan. Cunningham suspected the choreographer's
disapproval, and, most likely, she was correct.
</P>
<P>
   Graham spent six more decades cultivating a portraiture as
theatricalized and archetypal as the characters she danced. In
contrast, Cunningham's images feel far too sensuous and intimate.
In them, the dancer regains her human flesh and sinew.

GRETZKY'S 38TH BIRTHDAY IS A BASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOE LAPOINTE 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two days after winning a sport utility vehicle as
the most valuable player in the National Hockey League All-Star
Game, Wayne Gretzky observed his 38th birthday. He celebrated
Tuesday night by giving out the gift of goals.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky assisted on two scoring plays by Adam Graves and one by
Mathieu Schneider to help the Rangers gain a 4-1 victory over the
Washington Capitals.
</P>
<P>
   Ranger Coach John Muckler said, ``I was at the All-Star Game. I
watched Gretz very closely. He had a big smile on his face. He was
having some fun. Things were working for him, which is all great.
It looks like he had some fun tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Niklas Sundstrom clinched the decision with a short-handed goal
late in the third period, assisted by Graves, and Graves scored his
21st into an empty net after Washington pulled its goalie for an
extra attacker.
</P>
<P>
   Also starring for the Rangers was Mike Richter, the goalie, who
stopped 34 of 35 shots and kept the score tied when the Rangers
were overwhelmed by Washington attackers in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   The victory ended the Rangers' losing streak at four games, kept
them within range of a playoff berth in the Eastern Conference and
got them off to a good start on a difficult three-game road trip.
They visit Carolina on Thursday night and Detroit on Saturday
night. They have 43 points, 4 behind the eighth and final playoff
spot in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just love to play the game,'' Gretzky said. ``Mike's a
world-class goalie. He stood on his head in the second period, and
that was the difference in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The score was tied, 1-1, after one period and it was the same
after two, only because Richter played brilliantly in the Rangers'
net and the Capitals misfired on a few glorious scoring chances.
</P>
<P>
   During the middle period, Washington outshot the Rangers by
16-3. The Rangers had a power play during the period, but were
outshot, by 1-0, during the two-minute span and never managed to
set up the attack in the Capitals' zone.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what line or defensive combination Muckler sent out in
the period, all of them seemed to be a step slower. It was not as
if the Rangers were tired. This was the first game in five days,
thanks to the All-Star Game break.
</P>
<P>
   Coming into the game, the Rangers' power play had scored only
one time in its previous 25 chances to fall from first in the
league to second. But they scored on their first manpower advantage
Tuesday night. Getting the goal was Graves, assisted by John
MacLean and Gretzky, at 11 minutes 51 seconds of the first period.
</P>
<P>
   After he took a pass behind the goal line from Brian Leetch,
Gretzky fed the puck to the front to MacLean, who moved it
left-to-right for Graves, who was parked on the doorstep of goalie
Olaf Kolzig. It was Graves' 20th goal of the season, most on the
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Graves, who could become an unrestricted free agent this summer,
has scored at least 20 in his eight Ranger seasons except for the
lockout-shortened 1994-95 season, when he scored 17. He had 23 last
season despite being slowed by injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's Adam Oates, in his first game since recovering from
a groin injury, tied the score at 1-1 by scoring at even strength
at 18:04. Assisted by Joe Juneau and Petr Bondra, Oates' was the
last shot of several during an intense foray. He collected a
rebound and beat Richter as the goalie sprawled toward him.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider, the Ranger defenseman also returning from a groin
injury, gave New York a 2-1 lead at 1:37 of the third period by
pouncing on Gretzky's rebound and firing the puck high into
Kolzig's net before the goalie could move from side to side.
Gretzky, in his 20th season, is tied for third in the league in
assists with 39.
</P>
<P>
   With the Capitals on the power play, the Rangers made it 3-1 at
12:34 when Graves rushed the puck up ice after Sergei Gonchar
failed to handle a pass near Richter's net. When Juneau neglected
to cover Sundstrom, Graves timed a pass to him and Sundstrom
steered it in from the edge of the crease. It was only the second
short-handed goal of the season for the Rangers. The other, by
MacLean, came on a penalty shot.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second game of the season between the Rangers and the
Capitals. The Capitals won the first by 5-1 on Jan. 7. They will
play three more times in the regular season. Washington is one of
the few Eastern teams trailing the Rangers. The Capitals, who went
to the Stanley Cup finals last season, are 12th, with 36 points. &QL;

FALCONS SAYS THEY CAN CONTAIN DAVIS, with chart 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
MIAMI _ Talk to any member of the Atlanta Falcons' defense, and
you'll get the same answer.
<TEXT>
<P>
   All together now:
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to stop Terrell Davis and the running game first.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering that Denver's Davis led the NFL in rushing with
2,008 yards, scored 21 touchdowns on the ground and was selected
the league most valuable player, that the Falcons would have to
stop Davis first is not a revelation.
</P>
<P>
   How, however, is another story.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like we can stop anybody,'' defensive tackle Travis
Hall said. ``We are just going to play defense like we have all
year. We've stopped most running backs. We are not going to hold
him to nothing, but we must contain him.''
</P>
<P>
   During the regular season, the Falcons allowed only 75.2 rushing
yards per game, 3.33 per play and gave up a league-low six rushing
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta safety Eugene Robinson said the Falcons will play the
safeties close to the line of scrimmage and take their chances
against the Broncos' passing game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been getting advice from other players \Raround the
league\S on how to stop Terrell,'' he said. ``You have to try to
cut out the running lanes and play an eight-man front.''
</P>
<P>
   Falcons linebacker Cornelius Bennett said they must also play
aggressive but smart.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to know your assignments and be where you are
supposed to be,'' he said. ``Terrell likes for you to overpursue.
You can't pursue straight up the field. You have to go at angles to
take away the cutback lanes.''
CHART: Nowhere to run How the Falcons' defense fared against the
run during the regular season: Second in the league in yards
allowed per play (3.33) Second in the league in yards allowed per
game (75.2) Held 12 opponents to less than 100 rushing yards Set
team record by giving up only 1,203 rushing yards Led the NFL in
fewest rushing touchdowns allowed with six

Sharpe not shy MIAMI _ Broncos tight end Shannon Sharpe, the most
loquacious, lip-serving player in the NFL, was at his bombastic
best yesterday at Media Day.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some Sharpe samplings:
</P>
<P>
   On trash talking: ``I think I'm labeled as a guy that talks a
lot of trash, but I normally don't say anything until someone
starts talking to me. I'm always going to have the last word. I can
assure you of that. ... As Terrell Davis is the best player in the
game, I'm the best trash talker in the game. ... People say,
`Shannon is the most quotable guy,' but when my play doesn't match
my quotes, people will stop listening to me.''
</P>
<P>
   On how much he'll enjoy this week: ``We realize that we're here
for business. If you want to go on cruises or rent Sea Doos, come
back after the game and you can do all that. You can rent a villa
on Star Island, or fly on Sly Stallone's private jet if you want.
We're here to win a football game.''
</P>
<P>
   On why his brother, ESPN analyst Sterling Sharpe, didn't talk to
the media while he was playing: ``It came about while he was in
Green Bay. He only caught 55 balls. They criticized him, said the
Packers should have drafted Anthony Miller or Michael Irvin. The
next year, \RSterling\S comes back and leads the league in
receiving and everybody was saying what a great choice. It was too
late. He was scared. He really backed off and didn't have much to
say.'' Where's the hype? When John Elway's name is mentioned on
television, radio or in newspapers, it is often precluded with ``a
leader in fourth-quarter comebacks.'' Terrell Davis' name usually
goes with ``one of four men to rush for more than 2,000 yards.''
</P>
<P>
   But nothing is mentioned besides the name of cornerback Darrien
Gordon, who doubles as the club's punt returner. And that's too
bad, Gordon said, for quiet as it has been kept, Gordon is the
all-time leading punt returner _ in terms of average per return _
in league history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I line up to catch a punt I wonder why they don't
post, `Darrien Gordon, all-time leading punt returner,' '' Gordon
said. ``I don't get any pub for that, and it's a shame.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's regular-season punt-return average is 13.2 yards. He
has six touchdowns, including a record-tying two in one quarter. He
has averaged 9.7 yards on 17 postseason returns with no touchdowns.
Mr. Mom After the Super Bowl last year, John Elway's wife, Janet,
developed an infection after abdomen surgery. John Elway said it
was particularly tough on his four children.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were really worried because they know what cancer is,''
Elway said. ``I just had to sit down and try to explain what was
wrong with Mom, that it wasn't cancer and that she wasn't going to
leave us. My kids are 13, 11, 9 and 7, and things get going a
little wild in their minds, and so we had a little family talk and
they were a lot better after that.'' Briefly Wide receiver Willie
Green rented a convertible blue Lamborghini that is costing him
$1,500 a day. He is sharing the expense with wide receiver Marcus
Nash. Green drove the car Monday and yesterday. Nash gets it the
rest of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Safety Tyrone Braxton on dealing with the hype of Super Bowl
week: ``You've got to love this. How can you not love all these
people? You're down here in Miami and it's January. I'm from
Wisconsin. I had the convertible top down. This is great.''
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Rod Smith on his favorite pass pattern: ``Me,
myself, I like to go deep. That way we can get off the field, and I
can catch my breath.''

COACH'S PREPARATION MEETS OPPORTUNITY AT ARIZONA STATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
TEMPE, Ariz. _ In baseball, it's the trade that helps both teams.
In this particular college basketball story, it's the hire that
helped both schools.
<TEXT>
<P>
   About a year ago, when it was apparent that Texas A&AMP;M would
dismiss coach Tony Barone, the leading candidate was quickly
apparent. Rob Evans, the Mississippi coach who had been an
assistant at Texas Tech and Oklahoma State, seemed to be the
perfect fit.
</P>
<P>
   But, as often happens with the Aggies, ``negotiations broke
down.'' Instead of Evans, A&AMP;M wound up hiring Melvin Watkins of
North Carolina-Charlotte. Evans was hired at Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for Melvin and he's fabulous for Texas A&AMP;M,'' Evans
said after a recent Arizona State practice. ``It's something where
it really worked out for both of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have always worked out for me. I've always felt like
when I recruit a kid and I don't get him, the one I wind up with is
better. The man upstairs is looking out for me because this is a
great situation.''
</P>
<P>
   If you say so, Mr. Positive. Arizona State is recovering from a
point-shaving scandal that forced the resignation of coach Bill
Frieder two years ago. Don Newman, Frieder's interim replacement,
lasted one season before the school decided to hire a New Sheriff
to come in and clean up the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my view, Rob is someone who is very straightforward, a
stand-up professional,'' Arizona State athletic director Kevin
White said.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State's last conference championship came in 1973. The
Sun Devils have made two NCAA Tournament appearances in the past 17
seasons. The school's basketball tradition is as arid as the
climate.
</P>
<P>
   And that's another reason why Evans is a good fit here. He knows
all about winning at a school where the basketball history fits on
an index card. Compared with his former school, Arizona State is a
veritable North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   After a quarter of a century as an assistant coach, Evans got
his chance to be a head coach. He was handed the keys to
Mississippi's program in 1993. Few expected Evans to be seen or
heard from again.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got to Mississippi, that might have been the bleakest
situation I've seen,'' said Evans, 52. ``I took a pay cut. I was
making $70,000 and I was making more at Oklahoma State as an
assistant. The facilities were awful. Attendance was awful.''
</P>
<P>
   What Evans doesn't say is that he is a black man who was taking
over as coach at a school that has displayed a Confederate flag as
its symbol and has played ``Dixie'' as a ``fight'' song. Try to
recruit African-American players to a school with ``that'' baggage.
</P>
<P>
   In his final two seasons the Rebels won 42 games and twice
finished on top of the Southeastern Conference West Division. Evans
proved that he could build something out of very little.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils are 11-8 overall and 3-4 in the Pacific-10. Evans
is trying to build his program's foundation by emphasizing defense
and discipline. Arizona State's gambling scandal, he said, ``was no
factor'' as the Sun Devils signed an impressive recruiting class in
November.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Arizona State is one of the few schools, probably one
of 20, that has the chance to win the national championship,''
Evans said. ``It may never happen. But you've got the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the A&AMP;M job was a good situation and possibility for
me. The new facility, the location ... I thought there were three
or four jobs in the country that were ones I would leave Ole Miss
for, and A&AMP;M was one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State, it turned out, was also on that list.

WITH TERRERI IN GOAL, DEVILS STOP SENATORS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Nothing discouraged the Devils on
Tuesday night, not the three losses to Ottawa earlier this month,
not even a sore neck to Martin Brodeur that developed just before
the game and forced him to sit.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Terreri, Brodeur's understudy, stepped right into
Brodeur's skates and came up with an inspiring performance in goal
in only his seventh start of the season. Terreri's timely saves and
some effective finishing led the Devils to a 4-1 triumph over the
Senators, the team that has been their biggest nemesis the past
three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The victory brought revenge and redemption against Ottawa and
Damian Rhodes, the starting goaltender. The Senators eliminated the
Devils in the playoffs last spring and prevented the Devils from
making the playoffs in the last game of the regular season in 1996,
the year after the Devils captured the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Pandolfo, Brendan Morrison, Brian Rolston and Vadim
Sharifijanov scored the goals for the team's third consecutive
victory, which pushed the Devils (26-14-5) into fourth place ahead
of the Senators (25-15-6) in the overall standing in the Eastern
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Terreri won his first four starts this season before losing his
next two. He gained his fifth victory of the season Tuesday night
on 24 saves and just one blemish, a goal by Shawn McEachern, which
came late in the second, after the Devils had scored their four
goals.
</P>
<P>
   A save by Terreri in the eighth minute after a giveaway in his
zone inspired the Devils to take the lead on Pandolfo's 11th goal
of the season about five minutes later. His goal came from a sharp
angle on the left after the puck ricocheted into the net off
Rhodes' skate.
</P>
<P>
   Another good save by Terreri in the 15th minute of the first
period, this time on Aleksei Yashin, encouraged the Devils even
more. Morrison extended the lead to 2-0 with 1 minute 39 seconds
left, when he found the upper right corner from the bottom of the
right circle for his sixth goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils came out with plenty of enthusiasm for the second
period. It reached a higher level when Rolston stripped Wade Redden
at the Devils' blue line during an Ottawa power play, skated in
alone on Rhodes and beat him with a backhander.
</P>
<P>
   Rolston's goal was his 13th of the season (and fourth
short-handed) to give him his 33rd point of the season, passing his
total last season. Playing in his 300th game, Rolston had trouble
controlling his joy as he joined his teammates on the bench after
his goal.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes was under siege for the rest of the second period as the
Devils kept entering his zone in waves and Sharifijanov gave the
Devils a 4-0 lead with his eighth goal of the season with 1:48
left.
</P>
<P>
   But McEachern took part of the momentum and joy away from the
Devils by getting his 22nd goal of the season with 47.5 seconds
left to narrow the gap going into the last period.

SALO CONTINUES TO SAVE HIS JOB AS WELL AS SHOTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ Shots have been fired at the New York
Islanders' Tommy Salo from all angles this season. He was
considered to be good, but not a legitimate starting goalie,
someone who cracked under pressure and wasn't consistent enough.
Once the Islanders' franchise goalie, Salo was reduced to trade
bait two weeks ago when the Islanders acquired Felix Potvin, a
two-time All-Star, from the Toronto Maple Leafs.
</P>
<P>
   Salo never complained and he never demanded a trade. He never
said anything negative about Mike Milbury, the team's general
manager, who had promised to trade him as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing Milbury was preoccupied with other things last
week. Because on Tuesday night, Salo found his way back into net,
and he was outstanding again. Salo stopped 25 shots as the
Islanders beat the Boston Bruins, 4-1, at Nassau Coliseum. As the
clock expired, the 10,061 fans revived the chant ``Salo! Salo!''
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders (15-29-3) got goals from Robert Reichel (two),
Bryan Smolinksi and Zigmund Palffy in their second straight victory
under Bill Stewart, who replaced Milbury as head coach last
Thursday, when Stewart guided them to their first victory since
Dec. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Taylor scored the only goal for the Bruins (20-17-7), who
had 16 saves from Byron Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   When the Islanders traded Bryan Berard to the Maple Leafs for
Potvin on Jan. 9, Salo's days as an Islander seemed to be finished.
Berard for Potvin, Salo for a much-needed scorer.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it has been almost three weeks since the 21-year-old
Berard was dealt for Potvin, 27, a move that was widely criticized
as shortsighted. And not only does Salo still have a Long Island
address but he has also started the Islanders' last two games.
</P>
<P>
   Looks as if the Islanders have themselves a goalie controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Potvin, and his $2.7 million contract, watched from
the bench as Salo stole another game. Salo had earned Tuesday
night's start, Stewart said, after his sparkling 26-save
performance in the Islanders' slump-busting 5-2 victory in
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   So where does this leave Potvin? In the same spot he was in at
Toronto before demanding to be traded. He has struggled since
coming to the Islanders, and has yet to start for Stewart, whose
philosophy is to play the goalie who is winning.
</P>
<P>
   So if Salo continues to win, Potvin will continue to sit.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders handed Salo a two-goal lead in the first period,
and Salo took it from there.
</P>
<P>
   Reichel gave the Islanders a 1-0 lead at 5 minutes 42 seconds of
the first period. Palffy started the play with a snappy drop pass
to Reichel, who whipped a wrist shot through a screen and past
Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   On the same shift, only 40 seconds later, Smolinski scored his
first goal since Dec. 18. Reichel set up Smolinski with a behind
the back pass into the slot. Smolinski controlled the puck and
lifted it into the corner, over Dafoe's right leg pad.
</P>
<P>
   In the second period, Reichel scored again and Palffy got his
first goal since Jan. 2 to put the Islanders ahead by 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   Reichel's second goal was set up by Trevor Linden, who threaded
a pass behind the Bruins' lone defenseman on a two-on-one rush.
When the puck hit Reichel's stick, he faked left, then right, then
left again and slid the puck under Dafoe's stick.

SHIMMERING ORCHESTRAL TAPESTRIES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 31) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It may not be helpful to living musical practitioners to know
this, but death does wonders for a composer's reputation, at least
as measured by representation on CD.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous recordings of works by Luigi Nono, John Cage, Witold
Lutoslawski and Toru Takemitsu have come too late for them to hear,
and the posthumous crescendo is even more spectacular in the case
of Morton Feldman.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his death, in 1987, the CD catalogue included
barely a handful of his pieces. Now his whole immense output is
heaving into view, and the peaks are beginning to become evident.
Most recently, three releases have started to repair the neglect of
his orchestral compositions.
</P>
<P>
   Feldman's absorption with the orchestra was a phenomenon of the
1970s, when he produced 11 big scores, most of them with abstract
titles: ``Cello and Orchestra,'' ``String Quartet and Orchestra''
or simply ``Orchestra.'' The list looks monotonous, perhaps
deliberately so, and certainly the works are all alike in being
continuous, slow and generally quiet.
</P>
<P>
   But the range possible within that overall character is
astonishing. Where ``Piano and Orchestra,'' for instance, suggests
stillness, bells and clouds, ``Oboe and Orchestra'' is urgent and
intense. There was also, it seems, an increasing concern with
repeating patterns, until Feldman stopped writing for large
resources and began his great carpets of sound for piano, string
quartet or other small ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   His only composition for full orchestra after 1979 was ``Coptic
Light,'' written after a gap of seven years on a commission from
the New York Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   This unique piece amplifies the carpet manner. A string-led
orchestral body weaves stitch after similar stitch, occasionally
shifting to a different motif. Meanwhile, percussion instruments
patter with other repeated figures and the rest of the orchestra
supports held tones in an effect Feldman likened to that of a
piano's sustaining pedal.
</P>
<P>
   The textile metaphor, too, was his own. He loved, studied and
collected Oriental rugs, and titled ``Coptic Light'' with reference
to Coptic textiles he had seen at the Louvre. Like those scraps of
fabric, this music is woven, and the light surely comes from its
shimmer of similar threads repeating over background hazes.
</P>
<P>
   Long awaited on CD, this remarkable composition can now be heard
in two versions, performed by Michael Tilson Thomas and the New
World Symphony (Argo 448 513) and by Michael Morgan and the
Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin (CPO 999 189).
</P>
<P>
   The recordings are quite different. If Thomas' has more light,
Morgan's is more Coptic. One puts more emphasis on continuity, into
which the repetitions start to blur (though they blur clearly),
while the other keeps the weaving in focus.
</P>
<P>
   The American recording is also slower, by a significant 25
percent, and more laid back. Perhaps it is thereby truer to the
composer, though one might well prefer Morgan's more insistent
approach, especially when he combines insistence with objectivity.
</P>
<P>
   The music sounds as relentless as the sea washing onto a beach:
each repetition is a new wave, often only marginally distinct from
the last in its force and the outline it leaves on the sand. And
the process seems just to stop, whereas Thomas shapes the piece
toward a dissolve.
</P>
<P>
   Different couplings may help the buyer choose. Morgan's
recording comes with a set of Feldman pieces from the beginning of
the 60s, ``Durations I-V.'' Comparative miniatures in length and
sonority, these are scored for groups ranging from duet (cello and
piano) to sextet by way of two delightful and very Feldmanesque
trio combinations: violin, piano and tuba, and violin, cello and
vibraphone.
</P>
<P>
   Each instrument proceeds in its own time through a sequence of
short phrases, repetitions and lone sounds, but there is no danger
of inconsistency when the atmosphere is so calm. The performances,
by the Ensemble Avant-Garde of Leipzig, are poised and beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas offers two orchestral works from the preceding decade:
``Piano and Orchestra'' and ``Cello and Orchestra,'' with Alan
Feinberg and Robert Cohen the soloists. ``Piano and Orchestra'' is
an anticoncerto, not only in its concentration on minimal effect in
the solo part, much of which consists of single chords or note
repetitions, all quiet, but also in its use of an orchestral piano
to play some of the solo material while the ostensible soloist sits
silent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cello and Orchestra,'' on the other hand, is centered on the
soloist, who lifts up one contemplative phrase after another, then
takes a wonderfully long time to find the right close.
</P>
<P>
   The performances are much surer than those to be heard in an
alternative release, again from CPO (999 483; two CDs), which
combines these two works with others of the same period, ``Oboe and
Orchestra'' and ``Flute and Orchestra,'' all played by the
Saarbrucken Radio Symphony under the direction of Hans Zender.
</P>
<P>
   But this set, on two disks for the price of one, has the
advantage that ``Oboe and Orchestra'' is so strong and moving a
piece. It starts with the oboe slowly wailing over a background of
tam-tam crashes and continues like a wild lament heard from a great
distance. Sometimes the oboe seems to be remembering its role as
orchestral tuner, though it might appear that the orchestra is
tuning the oboe rather than the other way round. At other times the
soloist's repeated motifs are wide and fraught.
</P>
<P>
   Armin Aussem is the excellent oboist, and this recording, along
with Morgan's of ``Coptic Light,'' demands to be heard widely. It
may be significant that ``Oboe and Orchestra'' came just before
``Neither,'' another high point in Feldman's output (available on
Hat Art).
</P>
<P>
   ``Flute and Orchestra,'' which came later, drifts into endless
repetitions without yet acquiring the qualities of ``Coptic
Light,'' whether the soft ferocity of Morgan's performance or the
quiet blaze of Thomas'.

PATAKI WANTS TO USE TOBACCO FUNDS TO REDUCE DEBT
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki said Tuesday that for the next
five years, New York state should use 75 percent of its share of
the national tobacco lawsuit settlement, or $1.5 billion, to reduce
state debt.
</P>
<P>
   Just days ago, his aides signaled that the governor wanted to
use some of the settlement to provide coverage for the rapidly
growing number of people without health insurance, raising the
hopes of health-care advocates that Pataki planned a major
initiative for the uninsured. But the governor made it clear
Tuesday that he had in mind a sum that would cover only a small
fraction of the more than 3 million New Yorkers who are uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   The $25 billion settlement is to be paid over 25 years, with the
state and local governments splitting the money. Pataki said in the
first five years he wanted to dedicate 25 percent of the state's
share to health care, about $100 million a year, a fairly small
amount to a state health care budget that stands at $27 billion.
Uses for that $100 million, he said, would include not only
coverage for the uninsured, but anti-smoking programs and doctor
training.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican governor was declaring his opening position in
what is sure to be a long, hard piece of bargaining with the
Legislature. His stance puts him starkly at odds with the Democrats
who control the state Assembly, and with health care advocates and
leaders of the health care industry, who had hoped that most of the
money would go toward helping the uninsured and reducing the number
of people who smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's tobacco proposal is part of a larger plan to keep state
debt essentially flat over the next five years. Independent
analysts have sharply criticized the governor for increasing debt,
even as the state enjoys record surpluses, and the debt is
frequently cited as a factor in the state's low credit rating.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco money comes from last year's settlement of lawsuits
filed by the states against tobacco companies, to recoup money
spent on treating people with smoking-related illnesses. The
companies agreed to pay the states $246 billion over 25 years. New
York's share would be $800 million a year at the start, growing to
$1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Around the country, states are just starting to decide how to
use the tobacco money, and no real patterns have emerged. But a
handful of governors have proposed that virtually all the money go
to health care.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the governor and the Legislature must decide
together how to spend the money, and Pataki's stance Tuesday puts
him at odds with both houses. The Democrats who control the state
Assembly say it should go to health care and school construction,
and the Republicans who control the Senate want a large part of it
to be used for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, D-Manhattan, said: ``It's
totally inappropriate that the scarred lungs of New Yorkers be used
to enhance his political ambitions. He's designing his priorities
to appeal to the radical right of the national Republican Party,
instead of using these dollars the way they were intended, like
anti-teen-age smoking programs and coverage for the uninsured.''
</P>
<P>
   State Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, R-Rensselaer County,
had talked about using one-third of the money for health care
programs, one-third for tax cuts and one-third for debt reduction,
but he refrained from criticizing Pataki's proposals Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Kenneth Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital
Association, said, ``Since these funds were predicated on the pain
and suffering of tobacco users, it ought to be used for health care
purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals stand to gain directly from any program to aid people
without health insurance, because those people are often treated in
emergency rooms and cannot pay their bills, so the burden for their
care falls heavily on hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the governor's proposal for using the tobacco money drew
fire Tuesday, his debt reduction plan attracted praise from fiscal
analysts, some of whom have been sharply critical of him in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that this is a very good first step, and I'm pleased
that the governor has shown some real commitment on this,'' said
state Comptroller H. Carl McCall, a Democrat who has frequently
called for debt reduction. ``I think he's listening to me.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ If Denver receivers Ed McCaffrey and Rod Smith were a
comedy team, they would be like Laurel and Hardy, Martin and Lewis
or the Smothers Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey would be the straight man. He's about as lively as
cold oatmeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what you play your whole career for,'' McCaffrey said
Tuesday about being in Super Bowl XXXIII.
</P>
<P>
   The loquacious Smith would be the comedian. He accommodates all
requests for sound bites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got so much talent on this team _ kind of like having a
six-pack of Coke,'' Smith said. ``When you finish one bottle,
there's always another one right there ready for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Broncos, McCaffrey and Smith make a great
team _ not as comedians but as receivers. This season, they
combined to catch 150 passes (Smith 86, McCaffrey 64) for 2,275
yards (Smith 1,222, McCaffrey 1,053) and 16 touchdowns (McCaffrey
10, Smith six).
</P>
<P>
   In playoff victories over Miami and the New York Jets, Smith had
seven catches for 108 yards and a touchdown. McCaffrey had six for
118.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do everything together off the field,'' Smith said. ``My
kids play with his kids. I go to his house and play video games.
All the functions we have (off the field), we do together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed's a great competitor. I love playing with him because I
know he's going to be on the other side busting his butt. I know I
have to be just as good or better.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey was voted to the Pro Bowl, but Smith wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he's taking me with him, so I'm getting a free trip out of
it,'' Smith said. ``It's good to have a friend like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith and McCaffrey couldn't be more different. McCaffrey is
white, 6-5 and 215 pounds. He grew up in Allentown, Pa., played at
Stanford, was drafted by the Giants' Bill Parcells, was cut by Dan
Reeves and earned his first Super Bowl ring with San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is black, 6-0 and 196 pounds. He grew up on the Arkansas
side of Texarkana, played at Missouri Southern, was not drafted and
signed with the Broncos as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons cornerback Ray Buchanan, who will be covering Smith and
McCaffrey on Sunday, guaranteed an Atlanta victory. Buchanan has
been outspoken, and he showed up for media day Tuesday wearing a
dog collar.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys like to have the image,'' Smith said with a
laugh. ``Nothing he says or does is going to win the game. The only
people who talk and can affect the game are the refs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of what he says or does, he's still got to come out
and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who has quietly become one of the better receivers in the
league, can't wait for the Super Bowl, because he loves to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to play with fear,'' Smith said about his
motivation. ``If you play overconfident, you'll get slapped in the
face. You've got to have the fear that somebody's trying to take
something away from you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not scared of my opponent. I'm just scared of failing the
guys that I go to work with every day. I have to come back to the
sideline and look them in the eye. I want them to say to me, `Wow,
how'd you do that?' I don't want them to say, `You cost us the
Super Bowl.'''
</P>
<P>
   Smith is a big-play receiver. McCaffrey is a clutch receiver.
</P>
<P>
   In his career, McCaffrey has played with quarterbacks Phil
Simms, Steve Young and John Elway.
</P>
<P>
   ``All are very talented, but they have different styles,''
McCaffrey said. ``In terms of accuracy, Phil was unbelievable. He
was so smart. Steve's lefthanded, so right off the bat I had to
adjust because the ball comes at a different angle. He was
extremely quick, a pretty talented passer.
</P>
<P>
   ``John has unbelievable arm strength. It's never too late to get
the ball from him. If the ball's in his hands, you've still got a
chance to catch it.''
</P>
<P>
   If McCaffrey were the vengeful type, Sunday's game would mean
more to him because Reeves placed him on waivers when he coached
the Giants. But Reeves has since said it was one of his biggest
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the best thing that happened to me,'' McCaffrey said.
``I went to San Francisco (1994), and not only did I earn a Super
Bowl ring, but I met Mike (Shanahan), who was the offensive
coordinator.''
</P>
<P>
   When Shanahan was hired as head coach of the Broncos, he signed
McCaffrey.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and McCaffrey are excellent blockers. They wouldn't be on
the field if they couldn't block, especially for running back
Terrell Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason our offense is so successful and we score so many
points is because we're multifaceted,'' Smith said. ``Man, we've
got balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrell makes it go. If we aren't working hard and blocking
for him, the running game won't work as well as it does. The reason
Ed and me were over 1,000 yards is because of Terrell. With all the
emphasis the defense puts on Terrell, Ed and me get a lot of man
coverage. We should beat man coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   And they are favored to beat the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if this is going to be John's last game or not,
but we can't let him lose this one,'' Smith said. ``Whether he
retires after this game or another year, one day I can tell my
grandkids that I caught a lot of passes from him. And I dropped a
few, too.''

   WASHINGTON _ There she goes, again. Monica Lewinsky and her
entourage decamped from Washington on Wednesday, her business with
the House impeachment managers finished for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   Soon enough, Lewinsky is likely to be talking to the Senate, and
eventually to Barbara Walters. But she arrived and departed from
this visit without dispelling the air of mystery that has
transformed her from a California girl to a national enigma. Except
to those authorized to question her, she remained silent, lips
closed in a faint half-smile, Mona Lisa with a logo on her cap.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost exactly a year ago that the networks cut away from
their coverage of Pope John Paul II's visit to Cuba to broadcast
that footage, which we have come to know so well, of the president
greeting Lewinsky in a receiving line. This year, as Lewinsky was
leaving Washington, the president was greeting the pope in St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, celebrating the beginning of its second year of
convulsion over the former White House intern, gave her a new
sobriquet, the ``Mademoiselle of the Mayflower,'' after the swank
hotel where she stayed this week.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, when the House managers conducted their
informal interview with her, several Republican senators appeared
to be backing away from calling witnesses in Bill Clinton's
impeachment trial. By Wednesday the partisan lines had formed
again, causing Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle to repeat his
prediction that witnesses are ``inevitable. ``
</P>
<P>
   ``I think those soft Republicans have turned hard,'' Daschle
said.
</P>
<P>
   To win over their Senate colleagues, the House Republicans
reluctantly agreed to pare their witness list down to only three
names. There could have been no question Lewinsky would be on the
short list. Nor was it surprising that Clinton adviser Vernon
Jordan was named, despite White House attorney Charles Ruff's
impersonation last week of the testimony he might give.
</P>
<P>
   Given the case that the managers have laid out over the past two
weeks, however, the third choice seems very odd.
</P>
<P>
   Given the number of times her name has come up, the obvious
choice would have been Betty Currie, the president's secretary who
retrieved the gifts Clinton gave Lewinsky. Arkansas Rep. Asa
Hutchinson, in fact, made reference to what the Senate might learn
from observing Currie's body language under questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of Currie, however, the third person on the list is
former White House aide Sidney Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   It's important to call Blumenthal as a witness, argued Rep.
James Rogan of California, because Clinton lied to him about his
relationship with Lewinsky, knowing that he might be called as a
witness before a grand jury where he would repeat the lie. Yet
Rogan also described Blumenthal as ``just one example of several
aides whose testimony is already on the record,'' to whom the
president lied.
</P>
<P>
   Currie, on the other hand, is the only person beside the
president who can testify about several critical matters in the
managers' case. The conversation in which the managers allege that
Clinton coached Currie about what she could say she knew about his
contacts with Lewinsky has been quoted literally dozens of times
during the impeachment trial, the House debate and the House
Judiciary Committee hearings.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton attorney David Kendall pointed out Wednesday, the
idea of calling Currie to testify has already been condemned by
Utah Rep. Chris Cannon, a Republican prosecutor, as ``a rotten,
nasty thing to do with a public servant.''
</P>
<P>
   Could it also be that the managers shied away from putting an
African-American woman on a list that already includes Jordan? And
was it a point in favor of naming Blumenthal that he is roundly
disliked by many of the reporters and pundits who will be analyzing
his testimony?

SHARP-EYED COLLECTORS DRIVE UP THE PRICE OF FOLK ART  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 31) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RITA REIF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Outsider art continues to upstage American folk art
in gallery and museum exhibitions as well as in the press. But at
the auctions, traditional American folk art chalks up spectacular
prices for the choicest examples, while the quirky, visionary
Outsider art lags far behind in prices fetched at auction.
</P>
<P>
   This month's folk-art sales began with the proverbial bang at
Christie's when two extraordinary paintings by Edward Hicks rewrote
the records for the artist and for folk art.
</P>
<P>
   The first painting, ``The Residence of David Twining,'' which
had never been on the market previously, was sold by Dr. Thomas
Lincoln, a descendant of Twining and of Abraham Lincoln, for $1.4
million. Seconds later, a second painting, ``Peaceable Kingdom,''
from 1837, was sold for $4.7 million to Richard York, a New York
dealer. The total sales of folk art at Christie's was $9.3 million
and $2.6 million at Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in prices for folk art reflects the broadening and
maturing of the market. Twenty five years ago, most collectors
bought largely on instinct because the field was still relatively
new and few books had been written on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Today's collectors come armed with scholarly studies and advice
from experts, and as a consequence, they are knowledgeable about
the minutest details of objects, what makes them rare and even who
owned them.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of ``Peaceable Kingdom'' sheds light on how the prices
for folk-art masterpieces have escalated over the last 20 years.
The painting metaphorically depicts Isaiah's prophecy of the
animals of the earth in a wooded idyll while in the background
William Penn signs a treaty with Indians.
</P>
<P>
   It was auctioned in 1980 at Samuel T. Freeman in Philadelphia
for $210,000, which was then the record for the artist and for folk
art. Long admired as among the most gripping of the 62 versions of
``Peaceable Kingdom,'' it is also considered desirable because it
is one of few that include every animal in Isaiah's prophecy.
</P>
<P>
   The sales at Christie's and Sotheby's offered works from
important collections, each of which exceeded the totals expected.
The largest was the 660-piece collection of John Gordon, a folk-art
dealer in New York who had amassed pottery, weathervanes, painted
furniture and watercolors as well as the idiosyncratic 20th-century
works of Bill Traylor, Minnie Evans and Edgar Tolson. The pieces
fetched a total of $2.8 million at Christie's.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Kleckner, director of folk art sales at Christie's,
attributed the success of the Gordon sale in part to new findings
by scholars over the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   Three frakturs in the sale from Bucks County in Pennsylvania,
for example, which were identified as having been painted by a man
called the Rockhill Township artist, brought from two to four times
expectations. When not attributed to an artist, similar works sold
below estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, an 18th century floral-decorated redware bowl was
expected to sell for at most $3,500 but brought $13,800. Until
recently, Ms. Klechner said, the bowl would have been identified as
generic redware from Pennsylvania, but because its origins could
now be pinpointed to Hagerstown, Md., it was more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   At Sotheby's, traditional portraits, landscapes and marine
paintings from the collection of Edgar William and Bernice Chrysler
Garbisch, well-known collectors of Americana, were sold for the
Whitney Museum of American Art for a total of $685,000. And the
collection of Outsider art works by Traylor, Henry Darger, Nelly
Mae Rowe and Lee Godie, assembled by Herbert Waide Hemphill Jr., a
pioneer collector in this field.
</P>
<P>
   The collection was sold for $239,200 by the National Museum of
American Art. The costliest lot was a surreal Traylor drawing of a
leaping man on the head of a bird, which was sold for $46,000 to
James Curtis, a New York private dealer in 20th century prints.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the best economic environment for this sale,'' said
Nancy Druckman, the director of folk art at Sotheby's. ``And we had
an unusually high number of pieces that were fresh to the market.
This was really the last public chunk of the Garbisch folk art.''
</P>
<P>
   David Wheatcroft, a folk-art dealer from Westboro, Mass., was an
active buyer at both houses this month, spending in all more than
$330,000 for about about 30 items. His buying ranged from redware
pottery and paper cutwork to a Garbisch prize, a richly detailed
watercolor, ``Berks County Almhouse, Hospital and Lunatic Asylum''
by C.C. Hofmann. The painting is the only such watercolor on paper
known by Hofmann, and it sold for $112,500, more than three times
what Sotheby's had expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serious money was spent this month on folk art,'' Wheatcroft
said. ``It's pretty obvious that the folk art field is carried by
the economy. This market is not so superheated as the late 1980s
when it was almost as good as sold when you bought it. But we did
see some wild abandon at these sales.''

WAITING FOR A TRANSPLANT, WAITING FOR LIFE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 31) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Neb.)   (af)  
 By JEAN NATHAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Early last month at the New York Public Library's
Donnell branch, a standing-room-only screening was held of ``The
Kindness of Strangers,'' a 104-minute documentary that provides a
close look at organ donation and transplantation from the personal
perspective of donors, survivors, recipients and their families.
</P>
<P>
   When the lights came up, teary audience members could be seen
fishing for their drivers' licenses and filling out the organ donor
consent information.
</P>
<P>
   At the reception following, attended by, among others, friends
and family of the filmmakers as well as several of the film's
subjects, nearly everyone seemed shaken. In one corner, Lola Van
Wagenen, the mother of James Redford, the film's producer, was
huddled with her two daughters. All three were weeping.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which had its premiere at the Telluride Film Festival
in September, was also shown last Monday at a special _ and
especially packed _ screening at the Sundance Film Festival,
founded by Robert Redford, Redford's father. (Photographers flocked
to the screening with hopes of catching the elder Redford, who, of
course, was there.) The decision to include the film was made by
Geoffrey Gilmore, the director of programming for Sundance.
</P>
<P>
   Almost six years ago, after years of health problems stemming
from an autoimmune disease of the liver, Redford, 36, a
screenwriter, underwent two liver transplants performed by Dr.
Byers W. Shaw Jr. at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in
Omaha.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Redford, the father of two children, runs five miles, or
skis, or mountain bikes most days near his Marin County, Calif.,
home, and his career as a screenwriter is thriving. ``Hearts and
Bones,'' based on his screenplay, starring Kiefer Sutherland and
Darryl Hannah, has just been completed and other projects are in
development.
</P>
<P>
   But Redford is also trying to write a better script for the more
than 60,000 Americans now waiting for organ transplants. In 1995 he
founded the James Redford Institute for Transplant Awareness to
produce films that would educate people about organ donation. (Each
day, Redford said, 11 people die while waiting for a transplant.)
</P>
<P>
   To find a filmmaker for ``The Kindness of Strangers,'' Redford
did not have to look far. His best friend, Maro Chermayeff, whom he
met in pre-kindergarten at the Dalton School in Manhattan, was also
a classmate at the University of Colorado in Boulder.
</P>
<P>
   While he, in worsening health, went on to earn his Master's
degree in English at Northwestern University, she came home to New
York to begin a career as a film editor and documentary filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Redford and Ms. Chermayeff, who served as one of the film's
producers as well as its director and editor, decided to use the
technique of cinema verite, dispensing with narration and letting
their subjects tell their own harrowing stories.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Chermayeff scouted for patients and families, Redford
set to work raising the $600,000 required to make the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I begged, borrowed and stole from everyone, starting with my
parents,'' Redford recalled. (Ms. Chermayeff also called on her
family's resources for help, and Chermayeff &AMP; Geismar, her father
Ivan's graphics design firm, contributed the film's credits and
graphics.)
</P>
<P>
   Shooting began in October 1995, with one-third of the budget
raised, and was completed in March 1998. Since then, the filmmakers
have been seeking a distributor.
</P>
<P>
   The final film interweaves the stories of four transplant
patients with the stories of two families on the other side of the
equation who made the wrenching decision to donate while they were
still struggling to absorb the shock of a sudden death.
</P>
<P>
   The organ recipients _ all patients at Shaw's hospital in Omaha
_ were filmed during the first year.
</P>
<P>
   When it came time to address the donor side of the equation, Ms.
Chermayeff and Christine Le Goff, a third producer on the film,
made weekly trips from New York to Philadelphia to participate in a
support group for donor families at the Delaware Valley Transplant
Program.
</P>
<P>
   After two months, having gained the trust of the group, Ms.
Chermayeff brought in the film crew. And by then, Kathy and Russell
Kilmer, whose 20-year-old daughter Meghan had died in June 1996 in
a car accident, had invited Ms. Chermayeff and her crew into their
home.
</P>
<P>
   There, they filmed the couple discussing the painful decision to
donate their daughter's organs, and their heartbreaking
descriptions of coping with the loss of their daughter. They also
watched home videos of Meghan Kilmer on her prom night and of a
family Christmas when they were all together, footage that is
incorporated into the film.
</P>
<P>
   The logistics of such a project were daunting.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout most of the two and a half years of filming, Ms.
Chermayeff wore a beeper so that she could be there if an organ was
located for two of the would-be recipients she was chronicling, as
well as every time the Delaware Valley Program received a call
about a potential organ donor.
</P>
<P>
   And constantly she had to switch gears as the story shifted
beneath her. When a 4-year-old boy she had been following died of
an infection just after his transplant, Ms. Chermayeff, who was to
begin filming his part of the story in two days, instead helped his
father carry the child's body to the morgue.
</P>
<P>
   The viewer has the sense that Ms. Chermayeff and her crew were
everywhere at once. They are on the phone line when 12-year-old
Maria Darrah, who had hepatic fibrosis, learns that a liver has
been found for her, and they are there hours later as she arrives
in Omaha from Ohio and while her father comforts her as she is
prepared for surgery.
</P>
<P>
   They are there as Peter Wiley, a hepatitis C patient, weeps with
fear and relief with his wife as he is told the bad news, that his
condition is worsening, and the good news, that he is being moved
to the head of the waiting list to receive a new liver. And they
are there as the roller coaster dips again when he is moved down
the list as his condition slightly improves and no organs are
available.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chermayeff said both Ms. Darrah and Wiley, whose eventual
transplant surgery was chronicled in the movie, are doing well more
than ``two years out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just so pleased with what they've done,'' said Shaw, now
chairman of the department of surgery at the Omaha hospital, in a
telephone interview from Omaha. ``They dug through the superficial
layer of spectacle and got down to the human interest story.''
</P>
<P>
   And he spoke of an unexpected therapeutic effect the film has
had for him: ``Everytime I watch it I get more emotional about it.
You'd think that wouldn't happen. I thought I was dealing OK with
these things. Now I realize I was dealing by repressing my
feelings. The film has helped me to deal with the tragedy I see all
the time.''

TELEVISION AND THE HOLOCAUST: AN ODD COUPLE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 31) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAVID MARGOLICK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What millions saw that day in May 1953 from El Kapitan Theater
in Hollywood was a classic scene from the raw, unpolished days of
early television. Primitive microphone in hand, the host of ``This
Is Your Life,'' Ralph Edwards, plucks a pretty young woman out of
the studio audience, ostensibly at random.
</P>
<P>
   He then asks the actor Jeffrey Hunter, sitting strategically at
the woman's side, to read the cover of the book Edwards is holding.
``This Is Your Life, Hanna Bloch Kohner,'' Hunter declares. Mrs.
Kohner's eyes open wide and her jaw drops. ``Oh, no! Oh, my God!''
she exclaims in an Eastern European accent before sinking her head
into her gloved hands. The music swells, the audience applauds and
Mrs. Kohner is then escorted to the stage.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcast appears to be little more than vintage schlock,
but it is actually an important historical artifact. Sandwiched
between harp glissandos and commercials for Hazel Bishop's lipstick
_ ``won't eat off, won't smear off, won't kiss off'' _ may well
have been television's first feature on a Holocaust survivor.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the ``chair of honor,'' Mrs. Kohner watches in wonder
as people from her past materialize to recall her childhood in
Czechoslovakia, her deportation in a cattle car to Theresienstadt,
her survival at Auschwitz and liberation at Mauthausen. A studio
band plays Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, ``The Horst Wessel Song''
and the Kol Nidre prayer from Yom Kippur in the background.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards has a script, of course, but by today's standards the
show seems refreshingly awkward and unrehearsed. If television was
young, so, too, were public discourse about the Holocaust (the term
itself did not even come into popular use for another two decades)
and most survivors themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kohner had ceased to be one of those mute, gaunt, ageless
figures in striped uniforms standing at the barbed wire but had not
yet become one of the aged, often vulnerable remnants of Hitler's
Europe we've heard so often since. She's a beautiful woman in her
30s, confident, composed, surprisingly good-natured.
</P>
<P>
   ``May I say, Mrs. Kohner, that looking at you it's hard to
believe that during seven short years of a still short life, you
lived a lifetime of fear, terror and tragedy,'' Edwards tells her.
``You look like a young American girl just out of college, not at
all like a survivor of Hitler's cruel purge of German Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   Television and the Holocaust are clearly an odd couple, says
Jeffrey Shandler, who teaches in the department of Hebrew and
Judaic studies at New York University. But they are also ``age
mates,'' having entered the American consciousness around the same
time. And more than film or art or literature, Shandler says, the
much-maligned small screen is responsible for turning the Holocaust
from a calamity befalling a foreign people in a different time and
place into a ubiquitous, paradigmatic part of American culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Television and the Holocaust may seem strange partners,''
Shandler writes in ``While American Watches: Televising the
Holocaust,'' published this month by Oxford University Press, ``but
their half-century of shared history has shaped how Americans now
understand and respond to moral crises of modern life.''
</P>
<P>
   Scholars accustomed to maligning the medium have overlooked
television's contribution to that understanding, says Shandler, who
has a doctorate in Yiddish studies from Columbia University.
Eminent writers from television's early days like Rod Serling,
Reginald Rose and Paddy Chayefsky weighed in on the subject, in
shows featuring actors like Charles Laughton, Maximilian Schell,
John Cassavetes and Robert Redford; few then raised the point,
heard often years later, that television and the Holocaust were
inherently incompatible, that the first inevitably trivialized the
second.
</P>
<P>
   Because Yiddish culture, too, has historically been
underestimated, he says, redirecting his attention from Sholem
Aleichem to ``The Twilight Zone'' may not seem such a stretch.
``I've moved from one vernacular unjustly held in low regard to
another,'' he said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Television's ability to mold attitudes about the Holocaust stems
both from its intimacy _ its peculiar power to penetrate our homes
and lives _ and its reach. The 1978 mini-series ``Holocaust'' alone
reached 120 million Americans. But the coverage didn't come only in
extravaganzas; over the years the Holocaust has made guest
appearances on ``All in the Family,'' ``Lou Grant'' and ``Star
Trek.''
</P>
<P>
   Television helped the Holocaust infiltrate the American psyche
precisely because of the ease of the exposure; you could always
turn the channel or get up during a commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Shandler was working on an unrelated topic in the National
Jewish Archive of Broadcasting at the Jewish Museum in New York
when an excited colleague told him about Hanna Kohner's television
appearance. To Shandler it sounded like a parody from ``Saturday
Night Live.'' But when he watched the episode, he found it
grotesque, moving and utterly unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from Yiddish radio, he notes, individual survivors of
Hitler's concentration camps had been largely invisible and unheard
on the airwaves. Newsreel photographers had been more intent upon
filming bulldozers burying piles of corpses than on interviewing
anyone still alive.
</P>
<P>
   Early television approached the topic gingerly; so did American
Jewish leaders and Jewish television writers and executives. And
Holocaust survivors, then still known as ``refugees'' or
``displaced persons,'' were more intent on building new lives than
on reliving tortured old ones.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it took ``This Is Your Life'' _ which The Saturday
Evening Post once called ``the weepiest show on television,'' whose
guests had to be tricked into letting their life stories be told
and whose endings were all happy _ to make it happen. That six
million Jews were murdered isn't mentioned; that Mrs. Kohner's
parents and her first husband were among them is, but only briefly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Hanna Bloch Kohner, this is your life, safe and happy in
the country of your adoption,'' declares Edwards. He then presents
her with a charm bracelet commemorating moments from her life
(``Wouldn't you give anything to see what's on it?'' Shandler asks)
and a movie camera from the Spiegel catalogue.
</P>
<P>
   Discussions of the Holocaust, albeit in ways that underplayed
its specifically Jewish dimension, actually had became a staple of
postwar television's ``Sunday ghetto,'' those devotional programs
broadcast while people prepared for church.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1948 ``Lamp Unto My Feet'' featured two newly arrived
children discussing in Yiddish their first Thanksgiving in the
United States. Four years later, ``Frontiers of Faith'' did the
first English dramatization of Anne Frank's diary. More impressive
and more widely watched were the docudramas, which have since
become, quite literally, museum pieces.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Holiday Song,'' a 1952 ``Philco TV Playhouse'' production,
Paddy Chayefsky tells how a cantor rediscovers his flagging faith
in God by helping to reunite two Auschwitz survivors in Brooklyn.
To Chayefsky and other writers, Shandler says, the problem was
always ``how to present a Jewish story, especially one about
anti-Semitism, to an audience largely composed of non-Jews, during
a period when American Jews are particularly circumspect about
being distinguished as Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the producer David Susskind, a Jew himself, reportedly
complained that the script was ``too Jewish'' and asked Chayefsky
to make the cantor a minister or priest. It was Susskind's boss, a
non-Jew, who let Chayefsky change things back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playhouse 90'' presented a Holocaust-related drama in each of
its five seasons. One was Abby Mann's ``Judgment at Nuremberg,''
expanded two years later into the better-known movie; it achieved
dubious notoriety when one sponsor, the American Gas Association,
pressured CBS into bleeping out several references to gas chambers.
Another show, Rod Serling's ``In the Presence of Mine Enemies,''
featured Charles Laughton as a (British-accented) rabbi in the
Warsaw Ghetto and Robert Redford as a sympathetic Nazi who falls in
love with his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joseph Goebbels himself could not have produced such a piece
of Nazi apologetics,'' Leon Uris said afterward. Undeterred,
Serling later featured the Holocaust on several ``Twilight Zone''
episodes.
</P>
<P>
   Shandler says of these dramas: ``As documents about American
Jewish identity in midcentury, they're very revealing. American
Jews were then reaping all these benefits the country had to offer,
but at the same time they had complex and unresolved feelings about
losing their families in Europe. These two impulses were difficult,
if not impossible, to reconcile.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanna Kohner notwithstanding, the first watershed in Holocaust
television, Shandler argues, was the Eichmann trial in 1961.
Chastened into temporary public-spiritedness by the recent quiz
show scandals (in fact, Eichmann's glass booth reminded many
viewers of the isolation booths on shows like ``The $64,000
Question''), the networks began playing taped excerpts of the
trial, flown over daily from Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But many viewers were disappointed; the defendant was too
``banal, puny, enigmatic and boring,'' Shandler says. When ratings
dropped, so did the coverage. Convinced that a more palpably
loathsome Eichmann would produce higher ratings, CBS soon did a
docudrama on the subject, with Telly Savalas and Carroll O'Connor
playing Eichmann acolytes.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 17 years, the Holocaust appeared regularly in
dramas, science fiction series and even comedies, invariably to
examine issues of justice, intolerance, evil. Dennis Hopper went
through a mini-neo-Nazi phase in episodes of ``The Defenders'' and
``The Twilight Zone.'' Lou Grant has to approve a story of another
young American neo-Nazi, this one hiding his Jewish roots.

<P>
   Archie Bunker, of all people, discovers a swastika splattered
over his front door. The Starship Enterprise beams Captain Kirk and
Spock onto a planet where extraterrestrial Nazis have recreated
1930s Germany and cite Spock's distinctive physiognomy to prove his
inferiority.
</P>
<P>
   But the Holocaust moved ``from the episodic to the epic,''
Shandler says, with ``Holocaust: The Story of the Family Weiss,'' a
nine-and-a-half-hour, four-day prime-time mini-series just before
Passover 1978. It was this series that generated the first real
debate about whether television inherently trivialized genocide.
</P>
<P>
   But the same series arguably helped prompt the pope's visit to
Auschwitz, the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington and efforts
to videotape genuine Holocaust survivors before it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   For all of the shows he retrieved, Shandler knows that many more
are missing. For instance, he knew nothing about a drama I remember
vividly from my own childhood, circa 1960, in which a Polish
husband and wife, ignoring the ridicule of their anti-Semitic
neighbors, hide a Jewish couple under the floorboards of their
house.
</P>
<P>
   At the show's conclusion, two frail, elderly Jews, the real-life
couple, appeared on the screen; inelegantly reading a prepared
statement in heavily accented English, they thanked viewers for
witnessing their story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very often, people will mention programs I hadn't heard of,
and what is striking is that they not only remember the programs in
great detail but also the context in which they saw it, the time of
year, the room of the house they were in, who was or wasn't there,
the discussion or the bad dreams they might have had afterwards,''
Shandler says. ``It's a testament both to how much of early
television has simply disappeared into the ether and how pervasive
this subject was, even in the early years.''
</P>
<P>
   Shandler has even been told of the time a Holocaust survivor
appeared on ``Queen for a Day.'' ``It could be apocryphal,'' he
says. ``But it would be worth getting your hands on.''

MAVERICKS ROOKIE ADJUSTING TO NBA SPEED, STRENGTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Mavericks long-shot rookie Greg Buckner irritatingly
hung inside Dirk Nowitzki's jersey like body odor when the
20-year-old, prized German almost snapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get off!'' yelled Nowitzki, trying to clear offensive room by
swinging his bony elbows.
</P>
<P>
   When the scrappy Buckner wouldn't relent, Mavericks coach Don
Nelson stepped in with a lesson and a warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweep the ball low to get away from him, don't throw elbows,''
Nelson said calmly to Nowitzki. ``If you throw elbows in our
league, it's a technical foul. Two technical fouls and you're
kicked out of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   After a second, Nowitzki literally scratched his head.
``Really?'' he said. ``Wow.''
</P>
<P>
   One lesson down for the Mavericks' first-round pick, one million
to go.
</P>
<P>
   After two weeks in Dallas and six days on the practice court
with the Mavericks, Nowitzki is slowly but surely adjusting to the
drastic differences in culture and competition.
</P>
<P>
   Off the court, Nowitzki is quickly becoming Americanized.
Learning to live on a $1.47 million salary after a year of
$1,000-a-month wages in Germany, he has rented a luxury car for
three months, stopped calling Reunion Arena ``a big gym,''
developed a fondness for rap music and found his way to Taco Bell
on the 10-minute drive from the Baylor-Landry Center to his
downtown apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's OK, but I miss mom's kitchen,'' he said, joking.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in his life, Nowitzki is apart from his
parents and longtime coach/adviser Holger Geschwindner. His
girlfriend, Sybille, is coming to visit this week, but Nowitzki's
new caretakers are teammates Steve Nash, Hubert Davis and Chris
Anstey, who live in the same complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bit scary being so far from home and alone,'' said
Nowitzki, who, at first reluctantly, left his tiny hometown of
Wurzburg to pursue his NBA dream. ``But right now it's OK because
all I have time to do is just eat and sleep and play.''
</P>
<P>
   In between faxes and e-mail with the folks, Nowitzki is
furthering basketball skills that will, according to Nelson, make
him a strong rookie of the year candidate, and, according to
assistant coach Donnie Nelson, ``revolutionize the game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His size and skills are unbelievable,'' Nash said. ``The game
is probably a little fast for him right now because they don't play
at this speed in Germany. But once he gets more comfortable and
confident, watch out.''
</P>
<P>
   Pushing 7 feet but only 240 pounds, Nowitzki has been roughed up
by the Mavericks during the first week of training camp. Buckner, a
6-4 guard from Clemson, has frustrated him with physical defense,
and teammates said he has been passive to make his move or take the
open shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so physical,'' Nowitzki said. ``I'm not so good with that
right now. It's a huge difference.''
</P>
<P>
   In the open court, Nowitzki appears comfortable, fluid and, at
times, spectacular. But in bump-and-grind half-court sets, he has
not matched his teammates' intensity and aggressiveness. All to be
expected, Don Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's passing up some shots we want him to take,'' he said.
``But you don't get on him yet because it's not wrong how he's
playing. He's trying to blend in, and we understand that. At times
he's too unselfish, but he'll come out of his shell. I don't know
if it'll be this year or three years, but when it happens he'll be
a fantastic player.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowitzki, slated to be the Mavericks' starting small forward in
the mold of Toni Kukoc and Kevin Garnett, said he's struggling
knowing when to say when as far as being aggressive offensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Germany I shot about 25 times a game,'' he said. ``I don't
think I can do that here. I'm mostly a shy guy, and I'm holding
back. But hopefully it will click.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnie Nelson said this week that Nowitzki has the talent to
post up and score on any small forward in the league this side of
the Lakers' Robert Horry, and Don Nelson said he has seen nothing
to deter the enthusiasm that led him to acquire Nowitzki in a
draft-day trade in June.
</P>
<P>
   Even the off-court transition _ including the 24-hour
availability of volunteer assistant Bill Peterson to talk or shoot
jumpers _ is progressing smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't like Sarunas Marciulonis coming from communism to
free enterprise,'' Donnie Nelson said. ``We had to show him and his
wife simple things like how to use a credit card. But it is a jolt
for Dirk, and there's going to be a transition period. We want him
to live in the gym and get better, and so far that's just what he's
doing.'' Walker next With Steve Nash signed to a six-year contract
extension, signing power forward Samaki Walker is Don Nelson's next
priority. The Mavericks have until March 13 to sign the 6-foot-9,
260-pounder to an extension or risk him becoming a free agent July
1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to lock him up, too,'' said Don Nelson, who plans to
send a proposal to Walker's agent, Norm Nixon, this week.
``Depending on the numbers, of course. But I'm confident we can get
it done. He's an important piece to our puzzle.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker, after two seasons the longest-tenured Maverick, has been
limited to 43 and 41 games because of injuries but was Dallas' most
effective low-post threat when healthy last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried either way,'' Walker said. ``If we get it
done, great, I love it here. But if I have to play it out and test
myself on the open market, that's fine too. I hope it works out I
get to stay here, but there's always the business side of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson has used the extension period, which allows rookies
beginning in '96 to sign an extension during their third season, to
sign Nash this season and Michael Finley last season.

EDWARD J. KIERNAN, PRESIDENT WHO STRENGTHENED POLICE UNION, DIES AT
77
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Edward Joseph Kiernan, a retired New York City police officer
who headed the city's police union and two international police
organizations, died on Saturday at Castle Point Veterans Hospital
near Newburgh, N.Y. He was 77 and lived in Congers, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a stroke, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Kiernan spent 27 years on the police force assigned to the 110th
Precinct in Elmhurst, Queens. During that time, he helped to
transform the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association from a relatively
meek fraternal order into a militant and recognized bargaining
agent.
</P>
<P>
   With a touch of sarcasm, he liked to refer to the PBA's earlier
history as ``those days when we were just benevolent.''
</P>
<P>
   Educated at St. Agnes Academic High School in College Point,
Queens, Kiernan was appointed to the police force in 1942 while
serving in the Army Air Force. His duties took him to the South
Pacific, Australia, New Guinea, the Philippines and Okinawa. He was
discharged as a flight engineer and master sergeant.
</P>
<P>
   He was elected a PBA delegate in 1947, only two years after
joining the police force. After rising through the ranks, he became
president of the 30,000-member organization in 1969. He also headed
its legislative committee and helped shape a number of state laws
that benefited police officers and their families. Among them were
one allowing officers to ``moonlight'' in part-time work, one
permitting officers to reside outside of the city and various
pension and retirement benefit bills.
</P>
<P>
   Kiernan quit as president in 1973, a year earlier than his term
ran out, when faced with a rebellion of PBA militants who derided
him for refusing to support a five-day wildcat police strike in
1971. Kiernan said he believed that the association had better ways
to reach its objectives than walking out on the job.
</P>
<P>
   After also retiring from the police force in 1973, he served as
president of the International Conference of Police Associations
and of the International Union of Police Associations, of which he
was a founder. He retired from the international union in 1982 as
president emeritus.
</P>
<P>
   Kiernan is survived by his wife, Alice May Packard Kiernan; five
sons, Edward Jr., of Stuyvesant; Kevin, of Nanuet; Keith, of
Boston; John O'Brien of Congers; and Timothy O'Brien of Haverstraw;
three daughters, Karen Muller of Princeton, N.J.; Kathleen Maffeo
and Carol Klecar, both of Congers, and 10 grandchildren.

LORD LEWIN, 78, BRITISH STRATEGIST IN FALKLANDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lord Lewin, the British seadog who is credited with engineering
his country's victory over Argentina in the Falkland Islands war in
1982, died Jan. 23 in Woodbridge in the County of Suffolk in
southeastern Britain, not far from the sea. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was stomach cancer, The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   After four decades in the Royal Navy, the future Lord Lewin was
Admiral of the Fleet Sir Terence Thornton Lewin, chief of the
British defense staff, when Argentina started the brief undeclared
war by invading the Falklands, a crown colony, on April 2, 1982.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict was the outgrowth of longstanding claims to the 200
islands in the South Atlantic 300 miles east of the Strait of
Magellan and 8,000 miles from Britain.
</P>
<P>
   After Britain regained the Falklands in June, Admiral Lewin
retired, was made a life peer _ a baron _ and became Lord Lewin of
Greenwich in Greater London.
</P>
<P>
   The admiral was in New Zealand in early April when Argentine
forces occupied the islands, whose total area is 4,618 square
miles. But he hastened back to a meeting of Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's newly created War Cabinet, of which he was a member.
</P>
<P>
   Doggedly the admiral told the group, which included the prime
minister: ``We must be prepared to take losses. But we are not
going to lose. The only thing which will make us lose is if you
lose your nerve.''
</P>
<P>
   But later he confessed that the truth was that his countrymen
``had no right to expect that we could succeed in this.''
</P>
<P>
   His advice won Mrs. Thatcher's confidence. What he said in the
Cabinet's meetings gained weight from the fact that he had been
through extensive naval combat in World War II, and he had been the
respected contact man between the War Cabinet and the British task
force whose ships set out for the islands.
</P>
<P>
   As M.L. Dockrill, an expert on British defense policy at King's
College, London, has written, the British government ``was able to
muster an impressive naval armada that sailed to the Falklands.''
</P>
<P>
   The first ships put to sea less than a week after the invasion.
Before long Britain mounted a sea blockade around the islands. On
April 25, South Georgia Island, a dependency of the Falklands about
1,200 miles east of Cape Horn, was taken over by British commandos.
</P>
<P>
   On May 2, Lewin took a crucial step. Accounts differ somewhat,
but The Independent reported Monday, in an obituary on Lewin, that
he called the War Cabinet together and asked for a change in the
``rules of engagement'' _ governing the British forces' conduct of
the war _ that would permit an attack on the Argentine cruiser, the
General Belgrano, even outside the ``total exclusion zone'' that
Britain had proclaimed in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister said yes, as The Independent put it, and
``the submarine Conqueror sunk the Belgrano, killing 368 of her
sailors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the turning point of the war,'' the paper said.
</P>
<P>
   Terence Lewin was born in the channel port of Dover, the son of
Eric Lewin. He rose to be chief of the Naval Staff and First Sea
Lord from 1977 to 1979 and Chief of the Defense Staff from 1979 to
1982.
</P>
<P>
   He was made a Knight of the Order of the Garter in 1983. During
retirement he was for more than 10 years president of the
Shipwrecked Fishermen and Mariners' Royal Benevolent Association.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving are his wife, the former Jane Branch-Evans; two sons,
and a daughter.

LAKERS HAVE WORK TO DO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA _ Training camp is over. The training isn't over
at all.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers left Santa Barbara on Tuesday, leaving behind the
double-day practice schedule as well. But after the six-month
layoff, they have no illusions of being ready for the season that
starts, gulp, nine days from today.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say that we're ready to start the season, I don't think
anybody would say that,'' Derek Harper said. ``I'm happy that we
have another week to go, to brush out some more of the wrinkles.
Because we're facing Houston (Feb. 5) and we're playing Utah and
we're playing against a very good San Antonio team to open up the
season. There's a lot of work to put in before we face those
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's intrasquad scrimmage, played before a wild crowd
of 5,000 at UC Santa Barbara's Thunderdome, certainly showed the
wrinkles _ errant passes, air balls, airheaded plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's just overanxiousness, being out on the court in
front of a crowd, guys trying to do too much, trying to find a
rhythm again,'' said Rick Fox. ``The body does tend to turn on a
little different, the adrenaline tends to flow a little more.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' first public display since last May did have its
bright spots, particularly the play of Shaquille O'Neal, Eddie
Jones, Derek Fisher and rookies Tyronn Lue and Ruben Patterson. It
is perhaps no coincidence that O'Neal, Jones, Fisher and Lue were
regular attendees at UCLA pickup games.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, however, the game was an uninspiring portrait, one the
Lakers hope to improve upon in tonight's public scrimmage at the
Forum and in exhibition games Friday and Saturday against the
Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely rust,'' said Kobe Bryant, who was wild at
times Monday night. ``There's a lot more to be worked out, but
we're gonna do it.''
</P>
<P>
   There is precious little time to work out the bugs. Due to the
exhibition schedule, the Lakers only are holding four or five
complete practices before their season opener. And the compacted
50-game season virtually eliminates practices between games, other
than light, shootaround-type workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so essential that we stay with it and not become
complacent,'' coach Del Harris said, ``because we have covered a
lot of material and we're not going to be able to add much as the
season goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   Empty infirmary: The subject was injuries _ the lack thereof _
and so many Lakers were knocking on wood, you worried someone might
bruise a knuckle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to speak too soon,'' Harris said, knocking on a
reporter's head, then his own, in lieu of wood. ``We've been
fortunate so far not to have any (injuries).''
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of bumps and bruises to go around, but no one
missed much practice time _ in stark contrast to the Lakers' last
training camp, when O'Neal and Nick Van Exel both were nursing
serious injuries that lingered all last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knock on wood,'' Bryant said, joining the cliche parade.
``Hope nobody slips in the shower. Everybody's healthy for the
first time in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Familiar faces: Training camp came and went, and the Lakers
return home with the same 14 players with whom they left. That's an
unexpected development, considering they hoped to trade for a power
forward, specifically Tom Gugliotta, during camp.
</P>
<P>
   The Gugliotta deal was thwarted by Minnesota's refusal to do a
sign-and-trade, denying O'Neal his biggest wish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to make some moves, but I guess other teams really
don't want to help us. So from now on I hold a personal vendetta
against Minnesota,'' he said. ``Add them to the list.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal said the Lakers have enough talent to win, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have liked to have that thuggish forward that I was
looking for, that Horace Grant-type guy, but what we got is pretty
good,'' he said. ``We just have to work with what we got and
everybody just has to be on the same page.''

ABOUT NEW YORK: THE YEAR OF THE RABBIT BRINGS LUCK TO AN ARTIST
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Like many artists, Francisco Cardenas came to New
York intent on making his mark in SoHo. ``You have to go outside of
the familiar so that people will pay attention to you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his case, he had to go outside to help pay the bills.
Recently, he took a construction job installing a smokestack at a
restaurant at Houston Street and Second Avenue. But when he looked
at the long, black tube he couldn't help thinking like an artist.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the smokestack was covered with dozens of footprints that
looked like the spoor of a sky-walking phantom. The sight was
enough to let Cardenas justify the months he spends each year
separated from his family in Mexico when he travels to New York to
show his paintings to galleries and collectors. Besides, who knows
who might see the smokestack on the way to West Broadway?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting closer to SoHo now,'' he said. ``This is one way
to leave some footprints behind.''
</P>
<P>
   While he approaches SoHo from the north, he was already
encroaching from the south. He just ended an exhibition of
paintings and drawings at the Feng Shui Gallery, a small storefront
space in what had been a Buddhist temple on Eldridge Street in
Chinatown. Much of his work is surrealistic and filled with social
commentary. Granted, it seems fittingly surreal to find his
paintings on a street filled with trading companies and small
businesses with Chinese signs. But Cardenas thinks it's a perfect
setting that fits his plan to get outside and encounter the
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I came to New York,'' he said. ``To learn the
world, you have to travel the world. Now I have a chance to meet
the Chinese. Tomorrow, maybe Russians. Next, I'll go to upper
Manhattan. But to get there I have to go through different
cultures. In New York, you don't cross the street, you cross
cultures. On every street there is another world.''
</P>
<P>
   His work got the attention of Zaihong Sara Shen in December,
when a painting _ of a cherub hovering like a guardian angel above
a red, windowed apple symbolizing New York _ was included in a
group show. She offered him a solo show at her new gallery, Feng
Shui, which she named after the ancient principles that guide
architects in choosing harmonious colors and design. After speaking
with him, she could relate to his idea that you had to journey to
other lands to find what eludes you at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here to study something that China does not have,'' she
said. ``Which is capitalism.''
</P>
<P>
   When Cardenas arrived at her gallery a few weeks ago to hang his
show, he took the usual selection of Latin-tinged images. But he
surprised Ms. Shen with six drawings of rabbits done in bold, black
brush strokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw on television back home that the Chinese were going to
celebrate their New Year,'' Cardenas said. ``The Year of the
Rabbit. A rabbit is simple, no? So I drew it fast, like Picasso.''
</P>
<P>
   The rabbit drawings went over well at Ms. Shen's gallery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rabbit is a very nice year,'' Ms. Shen said. ``Not like
the Year of the Dragon. People get very nervous about the Year of
the Dragon. That is a year for extremes. The Year of the Rabbit is
very smooth and nice.''
</P>
<P>
   That is just the omen Cardenas needs. In the six years he has
been in New York, he has been doing whatever it takes to get ahead.
He saves money by living with Mexican friends in Brooklyn in a
house just yards off the elevated expressway in Clinton Hill. For a
while last year, he gave painting lessons to some people he met
while doing a mural in Bushwick. His friends had let him use a few
empty rooms in their house as a studio classroom, but they
reclaimed them this year because their children needed room to run
around. Now he sleeps and paints in a little room.
</P>
<P>
   Difficult? Sometimes. Maybe it's no surprise that among all the
surrealistic paintings he showed in Chinatown, the only realistic
image was one of a Mexican peasant selling carved fish against a
wall that had a faded and cracked sign for American Express. He
titled it ``The Daily Struggle.'' He was talking about it at the
gallery a few days ago when he spotted a ragged woman rooting
through the garbage cans outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``You come to New York and you see another daily struggle,'' he
said, standing by the window. ``Only this glass separates us. We
both are struggling. We are both from different cultures. Here,
everyone has to eat, dream and live. That is the great encounter.''

WILLIAM BATTEN, 89, EX-HEAD OF J.C. PENNEY, N.Y. STOCK EXCHANGE
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: W.Va., Mich., S.C., N.Y., Ohio) (bl) 
By SHARON R. KING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   William Milfred Batten, a former chairman of the New York Stock
Exchange and a former chairman and chief executive of the J.C.
Penney Co., died Jan. 22 in Hilton Head, S.C. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   Batten, who was often called Mil, became only the second paid
chairman of the New York exchange in May 1976 after his retirement
from Penney. While his original $2 million contract to head the Big
Board expired in May 1981, it was extended another three years.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman, Batten oversaw a $70 million renovation of the
exchange floor and the installation of electronic equipment that
tripled the daily trading capacity to 150 million shares. Other
changes during his chairmanship included development of a
subsidiary, the New York Futures Exchange, which was later sold,
and work on a system linking price and volume information for all
stock exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   Before Batten took over the exchange, it faced criticism that it
was dominated by securities industry insiders and calls that
specialist who match buy and sell orders should be replaced by
computers. The exchange was also under fire from the government for
not moving fast enough to develop a unified national market system.
</P>
<P>
   Amid such turmoil, James Needham, the exchange's first paid
chairman, resigned in 1976 with almost two years remaining on his
contract. The abolition of fixed brokerage commissions on stock
transactions a year earlier had slashed the profits of many Wall
Street firms, leading to a number of mergers and closings.
</P>
<P>
   And the stock market was still shunned by many investors who had
lost 40 or 50 percent of their investments in the severe bear
market of 1974. Other investors were turning to other forms of
investment, including commodity futures contracts and stock
options, which were not available on the New York exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Partly because of Batten's ability as a low-key diplomat, the
exchange installed enough computer systems to improve efficiency
yet retain specialists, whose job is to insure orderly buying and
selling of stocks. He also calmed the concerns of regulators in
Washington and worked to include traders and member brokerage firms
of the Big Board in making decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Batten became J.C. Penney's fourth chairman in 1964. As head of
the store chain, he presided over its transformation from a company
of Main Street merchants primarily in small towns into a
diversified, mass merchandiser primarily in shopping malls. As a
result, his predecessor, A.W. Hughes, referred to Batten as ``the
chief architect of the new Penney company.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also responsible for a significant expansion of the
merchandising line, the introduction of the Penney credit card and
the company's entry into the catalog business.
</P>
<P>
   Batten began his career with Penney in 1926 as a part-time
salesman in his hometown of Parkersburg, W.Va. In 1935, he was
offered a full-time job in Penney's store in Lansing, Mich., at $70
a month. He was told that this would be enough to live on until he
proved he was worth more.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran of World War II, Batten moved to Penney's New York
office in 1945. He became vice president of the company in 1953 and
a member of the board in 1955. He was named president and chief
executive in 1958. In 1964, he became chairman. Although he reached
retirement age in 1969, he was asked to stay on, remaining until
1974.
</P>
<P>
   Batten received a Bachelor of Science in economics from Ohio
State University in 1932 and did graduate work at the University of
Chicago. From 1984 to 1986, Batten was a fellow at the Kennedy
School of Government at Harvard University. He also served on the
boards of numerous corporations including AT&AMP;T, Boeing, Citibank
and Texas Instruments.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Kathryn; a son, David, of Palma de
Mallorca, Spain; a daughter, Jane Wild of Lawrence, Kan.; a sister,
Francis Young of Akron, Ohio; two grandchildren, and a
great-grandchild. &QL;

BEADS AND WILLIAMS FALL TO DAVENPORT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia _ Venus Williams' trademark beads went
skittering across the court in the second set Tuesday, earning her
a point penalty and the chair umpire her wrath. But Williams' game
was already coming apart under the relentless baseline pressure
that Lindsay Davenport was applying.
</P>
<P>
   Deep, forceful and relatively flat, Davenport's ground strokes
are now the confident shots of a player who belongs at No. 1, and
no matter what Martina Hingis achieves the rest of this week in
Melbourne, Davenport will remain atop the women's rankings.
</P>
<P>
   The evolution from slightly self-conscious, slightly erratic and
somewhat ungainly threat to poised, consistent and fluid force is
nearing completion. Tuesday's 6-4, 6-0 victory in the quarterfinals
of the Australian Open was merely the latest example.
</P>
<P>
   In the other half of the women's draw, No. 2 Martina Hingis, the
two-time defending champion, advanced to the semifinals with a 6-3,
6-4 victory over seventh-seeded Mary Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding Davenport's impressive game, even Williams, once
parsimonious with compliments, is willing to give the Californian
credit. ``She has improved,'' Williams said last week. ``She has
made it known she wants to be a competitor, a Grand Slam winner, a
No. 1. And I have made it known that I can be No. 6, so I have to
do better.''
</P>
<P>
   And after all, who respects power more than a power player?
Davenport, one of the rare women who can look down on the
6-foot-1{-inch Williams, has now defeated her at her own game seven
times in eight meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I did pretty much everything I wanted to do,'' said
Davenport of Tuesday's encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Her opponent in Thursday's semifinal will be Amelie Mauresmo, an
unseeded French teen-ager with broad shoulders and plenty of
breadth in her tennis, too. Mauresmo had to save two match points
in the first round against Corina Morariu, but she upset
eighth-seeded Patty Schnyder in the next round and then did the
same to No. 11 Dominique Van Roost of Belgium Tuesday, 6-3, 7-6
(7-3) to reach her first Grand Slam semifinal and probably not her
last.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is probably going to be very soon in the top 20 and
probably also in the top 10 because she has the game,'' Van Roost
said of the 19-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether Nicolas Lapentti of Ecuador has the same
sort of game. Even though he was a brilliant junior player, being a
fine junior seldom guarantees Grand Slam success for men. But like
his good friend and fellow South American, Gustavo Kuerten, who
emerged from obscurity to win the 1997 French Open, Lapentti is in
the midst of a memorable run of five-set victories.
</P>
<P>
   Four of his five matches have gone the distance and Tuesday he
upset the seventh-seeded Karol Kucera of Slovakia, 7-6 (7-4), 6-7
(6-8), 6-2, 0-6, 8-6, and gave the ever-more-egalitarian game of
men's tennis its latest unseeded sensation.
</P>
<P>
   It is just as well that Lapentti is only 22 because he has
played more than 20 hours of singles and doubles in this
tournament. On Wednesday, he is scheduled to play the quarterfinals
of the men's doubles with Kuerten, who was watching in the stands
Tuesday along with Lapentti's good friend Anna Kournikova.
</P>
<P>
   His coach, Pato Rodriguez, credits Lapentti's five-set success
to a month of intense training in Chile in December and a slightly
less fraternal approach to competition. ``Before, he was a little
too nice,'' Rodriguez said. ``When his opponent was down, you had
the impression he wanted to help him up.''
</P>
<P>
   Lapentti, who had never made it past the second round at a Grand
Slam event until this year, will need to lift himself up if he is
to change Thomas Enqvist's luck. The Swede, who had already
eliminated Australia's main attractions, Pat Rafter and Mark
Philippoussis, defeated Marc Rosset of Switzerland in straight sets
Tuesday to reach his first Grand Slam semifinal.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For Davenport, advancing that far is rapidly becoming a habit.
She has not lost a set in a Grand Slam tournament since losing at
Wimbledon last summer, but she would surely not have won with quite
such ease against Williams if not for what happened in the second
set with Williams serving at 0-2.
</P>
<P>
   On the first point of the game, the chair umpire, Denis
Overberg, called a let when a string of Williams' hair beads broke
and fell to the court. Overberg then informed her that if it
happened again, she was going to lose the point. Williams played on
and at 30-40, after she hit her first serve and then prepared to
hit a backhand, more beads fell free. Overberg called ``point.''
</P>
<P>
   In tennis, there is a rule against hindrance. Balls falling out
of pockets or hats falling off heads in the middle of play are
ruled a hindrance because they are a distraction. Williams' beads
apparently fall into the same category. Williams called for the
tournament referee, Peter Bellenger, but Bellenger would stand by
his umpire, even as Williams began to get tears in her eyes and ire
in her voice. ``This has never happened to me before,'' she
shouted.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after saying that she was ``losing control,'' she
walked away and screamed once more at nobody in particular as she
changed ends, now down two breaks of serve and 0-3. The match,
which had been of remarkably high quality early, and Williams'
ability to concentrate would not be the same again.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said she didn't think her beads falling off represented
a distraction. But Davenport said of the beads: ``You can hear
them, and you can see them a little bit. Fortunately, you learn to
play the ball. I'm not going to say it was a total distraction, but
it is a little annoying maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, it is also against the rules, but Williams has no
intention of changing her look in order to change her luck against
the formidable likes of Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like my hair,'' she said.

TAKING THE CENSUS TWO WAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Wednesday, Jan. 27: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's ruling against the use of statistical
sampling to supplement the traditional head count in the 2000
census is disappointing. Sampling has long been endorsed by
experts, including panels convened by the National Academy of
Sciences, to produce an accurate population count. But the ruling,
based on the wording of the Federal Census Act, is actually quite
narrow.
</P>
<P>
   The court did not address the argument that sampling violates
the ``actual enumeration'' requirement in the Constitution. The
court held only that the federal statute prohibits the use of
sampling to determine population for purposes of apportionment of
congressional seats among the states. That is a blow against
political fairness because states with immigrant, minority and
low-income populations have suffered significant undercounts under
traditional census-taking methods, making them likely to be
shortchanged on seats in Congress. The 1990 census missed an
estimated 8.4 million Americans, a disproportionate number of them
blacks and Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   But the court's ruling allows the use of sampling in collecting
census data for all other government purposes, including federal
aid to state and local governments. As the majority opinion by
Sandra Day O'Connor explains, the 1976 revisions to the Census Act
actually require the use of sampling for non-apportionment purposes
if it is deemed ``feasible'' by the secretary of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   That means the more accurate, adjusted figures can be used in
drawing within each state the congressional, state and local
legislative district lines. Using better data could affect the
control of Congress by increasing the number of districts with
substantial urban and minority populations. A more accurate count
could also affect state legislatures by giving more voice to areas
where undercounting has been rampant. The adjusted data should also
be used to determine distribution for more than 160 federal aid
programs. The Clinton administration should move forward with
sampling for those important uses while producing a separate set of
unadjusted figures for apportionment only. The Republicans will
balk at the two-track proposal, but accuracy, fairness and the
Census Act demand it.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Anyone looking at the lineup of ``Women in Music,
1960-1999,'' which assembled eight singers in a benefit for Zero
Population Growth on Monday night at the Theater at Madison Square
Garden, could have predicted doses of empathy, folky guitar picking
and sweet-voiced sing-alongs. Those were all part of the headlining
set by Jewel, whose fans joined in on ``Foolish Games'' and ``You
Were Meant for Me,'' and they had their place during sets by Paula
Cole, Judy Collins, Phoebe Snow and Janis Ian.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the songs were about romantic longing and healing the
wounds it left behind. But the gist of the concert had to do with
wordless music: the power of voices swooping, growling, breathing
heavily or holding high notes proudly aloft.
</P>
<P>
   At this point in pop history, the rubric ``women in music'' is
about as meaningful a category as ``men in politics.'' The mildly
eclectic concert included a young but old-fashioned country singer,
Mandy Barnett, the middle-of-the-road pop of Helen Reddy, Odetta
singing a spiritual and a blues and Phoebe Snow belting
rhythm-and-blues along with the folky contingent.
</P>
<P>
   The audience belonged to Jewel, who played a businesslike
35-minute set that was beset by technical problems and a band still
feeling its way into her newer songs. She has a gift for
heartwarming melodies; more often than not, however, she applies
them to trite lyrics, seesawing between self-pity and self-help:
``You realize that your only friend/Has never been yourself or
anyone that cared in the end.'' The awkwardness and adolescent
banality of her lyrics may bring her closer to her teen-age
audience. But her fans are also swayed by her voice: a girlish lilt
that can suddenly open up to a deep Joni Mitchell croon or a
country singer's twang or a bluesy growl, revealing the woman
within the girl.
</P>
<P>
   The concert's organizing principle _ beyond who would donate the
performances _ seemed to be that women over 40 could easily hold
their own with the young women who command major-label contracts
and Top 10 singles. From Odetta's African-tinged leaps and
syncopations to Ms. Snow's octave-hopping, gospelly glides and
Janis Joplin imitation, to Ms. Collins, whose legato phrases poured
out with her old vocal purity intact, they proved that point.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everybody showed off. For her virtuoso turn, Jewel packed
a big crescendo and a sustained peak into ``Who Will Save Your
Soul?'' Later she yodeled, with her glottal stops arriving in
quadruple time. Ms. Cole devoted most of her set to a come-on over
a funk vamp: cooing like Prince's falsetto, moaning like a
phone-sex operator and winding up with some mock-gospel
exhortations. Ms. Snow reveled in her gigantic range, from
ultrahigh near-whistling tones to low bluesy growls and siren
wails, pushing songs over the top.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ian _ wearing a Ninja headband, high-heeled sneakers and a
T-shirt that said ``Godlike'' _ sang her 1975 hit, the ugly
duckling's lament ``At 17,'' to a fully sympathetic response. Two
newer songs traded self-pity for defiance: ``Take no prisoners/Tell
no lies,'' she insisted. She then turned that song into a long
guitar showcase: strumming resonant chords, picking modal lines,
invoking the blues. Ms. Collins' showpiece was ``Colorado,'' with
her restless, quasi-classical piano lines creating flurries of
notes for a story of a kindly stranger during a blizzard. Ms.
Reddy, alone onstage with her backup on tape, struck Broadway
poses: wide-eyed, confiding, imperious.
</P>
<P>
   Mandy Barnett, the least known of the performers, arrived with a
full country band, including fiddle and pedal steel guitar, and
harked back to the sultry ease and controlled heartbreak of her
model, Patsy Cline. Her three songs used vintage country styles _
torch ballad, Western swing _ and her band had the preternatural
ease of prerock country bands. Most important, Ms. Barnett had the
vocal finesse: the husky dives, the controlled slides and the
timing to make her voice break just as she confessed ``I don't know
what to do.'' Surrounded by showboating, she made understatement
persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   After Jewel's last song, the women all returned to the stage.
There wasn't time for them to sing along to the tape of Ms. Reddy's
``I Am Woman,'' which was just as well.

GABOR CARELLI, 83, OPERA SINGER
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gabor Carelli, a Hungarian tenor who sang at the
Metropolitan Opera between 1951 and 1974, and was on the vocal
faculty of the Manhattan School of Music for 35 years, died Jan.
22. He was 83 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Carelli was born in Budapest in 1915 and began his vocal studies
at the Franz Liszt Academy, but it was not until he completed a law
degree at the University of Budapest that he decided to become a
professional singer. He continued his studies in Rome with
Beniamino Gigli, and made his debut as Rodolfo in a production of
Puccini's ``Boheme'' in Florence.
</P>
<P>
   In 1939 Gabor moved to New York and traveled across the United
States as a recitalist and as a principal singer with operatic
touring companies. He sang in the American premiere of Puccini's
Messa di Gloria, and performed with many orchestras as a soloist in
the Verdi Requiem, Rossini's Stabat Mater, Kodaly's ``Psalmus
Hungaricus'' and the Beethoven Ninth Symphony. He also sang the
role of Dr. Caius in a 1951 NBC Symphony broadcast performance of
Verdi's ``Falstaff,'' conducted by Arturo Toscanini. That
performance has been reissued on compact disk by RCA.
</P>
<P>
   Carelli made his debut at the Metropolitan Opera as Don Curzio
in Mozart's ``Nozze di Figaro'' in 1951, and over the next 23
years, he sang 1,079 performances of 56 roles in 39 operas. Most of
them were brief character roles that demand the good comic
instincts for which Carelli was known. But he occasionally sang
larger roles as well. Reviewing Carelli's 1957 performance as
Tamino in Mozart's ``Zauberfloete'' in The New York Times, Harold
C. Schonberg praised his ``sweet-voiced, dependable style'' and his
``smooth legato, sure breath and niceties of phrasing.''
</P>
<P>
   Carelli joined the faculty of the Manhattan School of Music in
1964. He was a voice teacher and also an ensemble coach until his
death.

SOTHEBY'S ASKS DEALERS FOR EXCLUSIVE INTERNET RIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In an apparent attempt to undermine its archrival
Christie's entry into the potentially lucrative online auction
business, Sotheby's is asking art dealers to sign exclusive
contracts that would prevent them from selling wares through other
auction houses on the Internet for at least two years.
</P>
<P>
   The effort comes as the two famous auction houses have moved to
enter the world of cyberspace, seeking a potentially rich new
marketplace to sell the high-end goods that have been their
traditional franchise. Sotheby's announced Jan. 19 that it would
begin selling some items online, while Christie's followed with a
similar announcement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But dealers around the country who received Sotheby's 10-page
contract, which the company stipulated must be signed within seven
days, are up in arms over the auction house's demand, on short
notice, for exclusivity. Many dealers, some of whom spoke on the
condition of anonymity, said they would not sign the exclusive
agreement because the Internet auction business is still in its
formative stages and should not be hindered by exclusionary
contract provisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't consider signing an exclusive contract to any auction
house which would inhibit the freedom to participate in a free and
open market,'' Barbara Mathes, a Manhattan dealer, said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Angela Westwater, a Manhattan dealer, says
she doesn't have much to lose by signing up with Sotheby's now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've signed it because we don't see a down side,'' she said.
``Two years isn't that long. Do I think it's going to be the wave
of the future for selling our best pictures? No. But why not give
it a try.''
</P>
<P>
   At stake is control of an online auction industry that a recent
study from a researcher, Jupiter Communications, said would sell
$3.2 billion worth of merchandise a year by 2002 as Internet
technology becomes more accepted as a means of commerce. The stock
price of Ebay, the online auctioneer, which was offered at $18 a
share when issued in September, closed at 220~ yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the 10-page contract that Sotheby's sent to
dealers last week, it would waive its vendor's fee, which varies
from 6 to 15 percent in live auctions for items under $100,000, if
vendors sign up within a week. The contract in turn would give
Sotheby's the exclusive right to present dealer items in
cyberspace, although it would rely on the dealers to bear
responsibility for authenticating their lots.
</P>
<P>
   Both auction houses, in stepping onto the Internet, said they
would concentrate on mostly lower-end goods. For its first online
auction this July, for example, Sotheby's plans to offer baseball
memorabilia from the collection of Barry Halper, a limited partner
in the New York Yankees. Executives at Christie's said Tuesday that
they would follow suit with an auction in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``The anticipation in the beginning is that we will be selling
things of lower value that are both easily describable and do not
require personal inspection, such as jewelry or collectibles,''
said Patricia G. Hambrecht, president of Christie's in North and
South America. ``Over time we expect that what we sell on the
Internet will change and be driven by what the marketplace wants to
buy.''
</P>
<P>
   If Sotheby's announcement of its new online foray last week took
Christie's by surprise, company officials are not admitting it.
Christopher M. Davidge, Christie's chief executive, said his
company had spent months planning a move into Internet
auctioneering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't caught off guard at all,'' he said Tuesday in a
telephone interview from his London office. If anything, Davidge
added, Sotheby's is the one feeling the pressure to jump into
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   But Sotheby's chief executive Diana Brooks said Christie's
announcement yesterday, with few details and five weeks ahead of
any official proclamation, carried a whiff of desperation. ``Their
reaction is, I think, a reaction to what we've done,'' Ms. Brooks
said.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Christie's and Sotheby's said they could not
estimate how much an Internet presence would increase business. But
Ms. Brooks said half the merchandise Sotheby's sells each year,
about 250,000 items, could eventually find a buyer through the
Internet. ``It's a new marketplace,'' she said. ``We are taking it
very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   So are other, more established virtual-auction companies like
Ebay. But it may take some time, perhaps years, before premium
brokers like Christie's and Sotheby's find themselves in direct
competition with the likes of Ebay, which is based in California
but exists only in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's such a wide gap between Christie's and Sotheby's
business and Ebay,'' said Nicole Vanderbilt, a senior analyst with
Jupiter Communications, an Internet market-research company based
in New York City. The two traditional auction houses, she added,
``might bring in some incremental business, but not nearly the
volume of the lower-end auction houses that you see online now.''
High-end luxury goods, she added, don't sell all too well online.
</P>
<P>
   But clearly the world of auction houses, still a province of the
wealthy few, now has the potential to transform itself into
something resembling an upscale home-shopping network.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, you are going to
be able to buy a work of art,'' Ms. Brooks of Sotheby's declaimed
enthusiastically. ``How exciting is that?''

A WRITE-WING CONSPIRACY FOR RAIDERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's bring back the Raiders, who we never should have let get
away.'' &UR;  &QL; 
_Larry Robbins, Encino &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
``I really think it's time we quit fooling around and get (the
Raiders) back in L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _LissAnn Recup, &LR;   &UR; Northridge &LR; !off! &QL; 
``Please do whatever you can to get the Raiders back to Los
Angeles.'' &UR;  &QL; 
_Norm Zeichner, Tarzana &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
LOS ANGELES _ When a newspaper is peppered with letters pleading
for the Raiders' return to Southern California, as this newspaper
has been lately, the possible explanations are various.
</P>
<P>
   It might be that Raiders fans have a little too much free time
on their hands, considering their team missed the playoffs for the
fifth straight year.
</P>
<P>
   It might be that Raiders passion burns deeper here, four years
after they skipped back to Oakland, than surveys suggest.
</P>
<P>
   It might be a vast write-wing conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Or it might be all of the above. With the Raiders anything is
possible.
</P>
<P>
   The letters have been landing on my desk and the sports editor's
desk for a few months, as many as three a week, which is a lot on
one topic. It wasn't until December that I spotted the pattern and
started to save the letters.
</P>
<P>
   The first thought was, Hey, if all these people concluded
independently that Los Angeles should invite Al Davis back, maybe I
should take their opinions more seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The second thought was, Hey, these letters have more in common
than I realized.
</P>
<P>
   They're all computer-printed on 8{-by-11 paper.
</P>
<P>
   The letter from Larry Robbins and the one from Carlos Rodriguez
have neighboring return addresses in Los Angeles; they appear to be
the products of the same printer; the date and salutation on each
is smashed together (``Dec.23,1998,'' ``Dear Mr.Modesti''); and the
stamp on each was upside down.
</P>
<P>
   LissAnn Recup uses the same space-saving style on the date, as
does Eunice Fischer.
</P>
<P>
   The letters from Robbins, Rodriguez and Fischer all are
postmarked in Los Angeles, even though Fischer's return address is
in Canyon Country.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody is behind this letter-writing campaign, and I was going
to find out who even if it meant dusting for Al Davis'
fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't that hard.
</P>
<P>
   I phoned Recup. She said she wrote her letter as a favor to
Larry Robbins, who is a golfing buddy of her husband, LeRoy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked, `Would you write letters?' and we said, `Sure,'''
said Recup, who, with LeRoy, is in the business of selling humidors
out of their home.
</P>
<P>
   I phoned Zeichner. He volunteered that he's an old New York
friend of Larry Robbins. They had lunch the other day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told (Robbins), I told him to get Al Davis off his
backside,'' said Zeichner, 69, who is retired from the shoe
business.
</P>
<P>
   I phoned another letter writer, Mike Bernstein of Costa Mesa. He
said he knows Larry Robbins because both are in the textile
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job is basically to pepper all the news outlets,''
Bernstein said.
</P>
<P>
   I'm guessing the common denominator here is... Larry Robbins?
Hello, Larry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not keeping any secrets,'' Robbins, 68, said cheerfully on
the phone Tuesday morning. ``I'm writing to all the newspapers,
(to) all the names I can get ahold of.''
</P>
<P>
   He called the other letter writers ``my group,'' and said they
number 10 to 12. Friends, business associates, season-ticket
holders from old Coliseum days. Also Robbins' wife, Sally, and
brother, Mike.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins said nobody has been paid to write letters.
</P>
<P>
   He said he did not write any of the letters over other people's
signatures _ ``I gave them !ital!suggestions!off!.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he does not work for the Raiders _ though ``I would like
to.''
</P>
<P>
   His loyalty to the Raiders stems from the fact he and Davis
attended the same high school, Erasmus Hall in Brooklyn, a few
years apart, Robbins said. Davis is one of the school's major
benefactors. The men worked together on a school reunion last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Davis knows about it (the letter campaign) and he's behind
us,'' Robbins said. But he denied Davis put them up to this.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, Robbins said, is to sway reporters, whom
torch-carrying Raiders fans believe have ignored Davis' side of the
breakup with Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the Raiders) were pushed out of here. Davis didn't leave
because he wanted to leave,'' Robbins said.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins and ``his group'' would prefer see Los Angeles try to
lure the Raiders back than pursue an NFL expansion team. They're
impatient and believe the Raiders could play here as early as next
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides,'' Recup wrote, ``I love their uniforms.''
</P>
<P>
   Would Davis come back? He probably would. He has lawsuits
working on two fronts that could clear the way _ one challenging
Oakland's hold on the Raiders under terms of a 16-year contract,
the other seeking to maintain ``territorial rights'' to Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Would we want them back? A poll showed Los Angeles-area
residents would prefer an expansion team over an existing team by a
3-2 ratio, and showed that our favorite NFL team is the San
Francisco 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   A Raiders spokesman, reached in Oakland, offered no comment on
the letter campaign, and could not confirm that Davis knows about
it.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least Davis should know he has friends in Los
Angeles. Or Larry Robbins has friends. One or the other.
</P>
<P>
   They're going to keep those letters coming. Another arrived
Tuesday. What else are Raiders fans going to do during Super Bowl
week? &QL;

there is one intriguing wine-related activity that remains in its

enterprises in this state are engaged in the exacting business of
producing brandies or eaux-de-vies by traditional Continental

CELTICS PUT ON QUITE AN EXHIBITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ SkyDome's gates opened at 5:30 last  &UR; evening &LR; , and
soon after, the destruction began. First, two doors and a turnstile
were shattered. After that, the Celtics went to work on the
Raptors, 106-88, in their belated exhibition opener. By the end of
the night, the memory of the NBA lockout had taken a beating, too.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been easy to forget about Ron Mercer, Antoine
Walker, Kenny Anderson, and Paul Pierce during the 204-day lockout.
That was when a mention of their names was usually followed by talk
of labor unions and salary caps. Tuesday night they brought their
labor to a familiar place: the court. It took about five minutes
for them to remind you why you might have missed them.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a Celtics fan, let's hope you can handle their
performance better than the people here. Before seeing Mercer
dribble behind his back and finger-roll in one motion, several
Toronto fans were so eager to take their free seats that they
destroyed a turnstile and broke down two doors. No one was
seriously hurt and there were no arrests. All other damage was done
by the Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not bad for nine guys, huh?'' Walker said when it was over.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics had nine players available, but it didn't matter.
This game was never close. That's because there were 14 points
scored in the first five minutes, and 13 of them belonged to the
Celtics. And of those 13, 11 belonged to Mercer.
</P>
<P>
   You may have heard that Mercer switched agents over the summer,
from David Falk to an agency owned by a rapper named Master P (also
known as Percy Miller). You may not have heard that hanging out
with the Master all summer made Mercer more vocal and assertive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being around Percy Miller has made me more relaxed and
outgoing because that's how he is,'' Mercer said after his
25-point, 9-rebound, 40-minute night. ``We'll be in the airport
walking together and a whole bunch of people, like 10 different
people, will go up to him and ask for autograph. Instead of just
signing, he'll go up to them and give them a hug, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Master P has had such an impact on Mercer that even Coach P,
Rick Pitino, mentioned his name Tuesday night. The coach believes
Miller's work with Mercer will help the player's game. ``I'm glad
he wasn't writing lyrics over the summer,'' Pitino joked. ``He was
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   That was apparent early because the 6-foot-7-inch guard was
brilliant for most of the  &UR; evening &LR; , shooting from every spot on
the court. With ease. After the game, Walker, Mercer's neighbor in
the locker room, paid him the highest compliment: He listened to
his music. While Mercer was explaining his 17-point first half,
Walker slipped on a pair of Mercer's headphones and listened to the
stuff that obviously has inspired his friend. ``And this isn't even
my type of music,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Mercer is the humble type, he would never take all the
credit for the win. He had help everywhere. There was plenty to
like. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   --Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   In short, you will like the rookie from Kansas. He passed well,
rebounded well (7), and shot well (14 points). He probably believes
he defended well (4 steals), too. But he was called for two quick
fouls in the first quarter. He will soon discover that NBA law
dictates that any questionable foul almost always goes to a rookie.
``I warned him about that before the game,'' Mercer said. ``That's
just the way it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   --Walker.
</P>
<P>
   Not much appears to be different with the captain, which is good
news for Pitino. He had 19 points and 6 rebounds. And he still is
not shy. As soon as the final buzzer sounded, Walker headed toward
the locker room and saw a scout from another team. The two are
friendly, so they chatted a bit before Walker said, ``We'll be
ready for y'all'' during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   --Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, numbers tell you everything. The point guard
played 15 minutes in the first half. He had nine assists in those
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   --Dwayne Schintzius.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I felt like I was going to die out there, but I'll be
OK,'' the 7-3 center said. He finished with 10 rebounds. ``The ball
was falling my way  &UR; tonight &LR; ,'' he shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino was able to smile at the end of the night. ``This game
helped us establish our offensive philosophy,'' he said. He raved
about Dana Barros, Popeye Jones, Tony Battie . . . everyone.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics took 204 days off and still came back looking good.
Everything went well for them. They even survived the Toronto fans'
attempts to, literally, bring down the house.

SENATE SEEKS A DIGNIFIED EXIT AS IT OPENS THE DOOR TO WITNESSES

 (Eds: SUBS 4th graf to note some Democrats may back Lott's plan)

By ALISON MITCHELL    c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Republican leaders on Tuesday took the
gamble that they can open the door to witnesses and still bring the
trial of President Clinton to a relatively quick, dignified and
civil conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and his deputies
have struggled to find a footing in the midst of powerful political
crosscurrents: the general public overwhelmingly wants the
impeachment drive to end, but the party's conservative base demands
that it move forward.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans have wondered just what loyalty they owe to
their colleagues in the House, who pulled them over the cliff once
before during the government shutdown of 1995-1996. And they wonder
what kind of precedents they are creating for history.
</P>
<P>
   With all these conflicting impulses in mind, Lott has now
created a middle ground for his party: to approve just three
witnesses, sharply limit the questioning time to just hours a piece
and arrive at an end to the trial by mid-February. It even seemed
possible Tuesday night, as a new flurry of bipartisan negotiations
started, that significant numbers of Democrats could sign onto this
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just trying to have a fair process here,'' the
Mississippi Republican said this week, ``but one that gets us to a
conclusion, as soon as possible, without rushing to judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott has been navigating his way through a caucus of many views,
not always following predictable ideological predilections.
Republicans say that conservatives senators like Don Nickles of
Oklahoma, the majority whip, or others who are former House
members, like James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, Wayne Allard of Colorado
and Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, have pushed to support the House
with a full trial and as many witnesses as the prosecutors wanted.
</P>
<P>
   But moderate senators like Susan M. Collins of Maine and John H.
Chafee of Rhode Island have also argued for witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama, a usual ally of Lott, has been
one of the Republicans most skeptical about witnesses. And Sen.
Richard Lugar of Indiana, usually a centrist, has been mostly quiet
in caucus, Republicans say, but sounded fierce on Tuesday when he
blamed the White House for any partisanship developing in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The White House has stonewalled almost every opportunity to
inquire about the president's activities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To hold this group together and win a majority for witnesses,
Lott has steadily reined in the House prosecutors. They once wanted
to call 15 witnesses instead of the three they ultimately settled
for on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He thus has played almost the opposite role as the leadership in
the House. There Rep. Tom DeLay, the majority whip, aggressively
pushed impeachment forward, by cleverly pushing moderates to vote
for impeachment, by not allowing them an easy out through a censure
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   The House prosecutors made it clear on Tuesday they were less
than delighted. ``We have always believed and we still do believe
that 10 or 12 witnesses are what we should have, and should have
been permitted to call to prove our case,'' Rep. Bill McCollum,
R-Fla., said. and should have been permitted to call to prove our
case,'' Representative Bill McCollum, Republican of Florida, said.
</P>
<P>
   But Lott's efforts seemed to have turned the tide on witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, many Republicans were saying the Senate could
very well decide on Wednesday to block witnesses, with six or more
Republicans voting with the Democrats. On Tuesday, by contrast,
they seemed much more certain that witnesses will be approved when
the crucial vote arrives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow we will vote in favor of deposing witnesses,'' Sen.
Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said confidently. ``And in doing so we will
reinforce the ancient precedents of constitutional impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   So the vote will satisfy those Republicans who believe it would
set a dangerous constitutional precedent to cut off the impeachment
trial and those still trying to decide whether Clinton did obstruct
justice and commit perjury. It keeps the party's conservative base
from charging that the Senate just dismissed the case. It keeps
working relations between the House and Senate majorities. And if
everything goes according to plan, the trial will end by
mid-February.
</P>
<P>
   But there are political risks for Republicans as well. Even
though they are reining in their House counterparts, Senate
Republicans will still be voting to prolong a trial that most
Americans want to see end. A poll taken by the Gallup organization
for CNN and USA Today last weekend found that two-thirds of
Americans believed the Senate should go directly to a final vote on
impeachment without hearing from witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The votes on Wednesday threaten once again to mark the
Republicans as the party of impeachment. If all goes as predicted,
the day is expected to bring what Senate Republicans had once hoped
to avoid: near party-line votes, as the Republicans first defeat a
Demoratic effort to outright dismiss the case against the president
and then most likely approve witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of the votes would be minimized if, as looked
possible Tuesday night, the Republicans and Democrats could still
agree on the plan to proceed with depositions and then end the
trial quickly. ``Even a partisan vote tomorrow I don't think will
necessarily be a breakdown into partisanship,'' said Sen. Tim
Hutchinson, R-Ark. ``At that point it might actually be the
catalyst for discussions to go on that would bring it to a rapid
conclusion.'' But if the talks break down, there is also the
possibility of partisan warfare. Before the two parties began
negotiating Tuesday night, Sen. Tom Daschle, the minority leader,
and the White House warned in increasingly strident tones that once
depositions are allowed, the trial will inevitably spiral out of
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our colleagues need to clearly understand that if it's a
choice between expeditious and fair,'' Daschle said, ``Democrats
are going to fall on the side of fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   And David Kendall, Clinton's private lawyer, warned the Senate
of a long legal process ahead ``if the genie of discovery is let
out of the bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are several ways this trial could yet be extended. As
the rules now stand, the Senate can take individual votes after
depositions on whether it wants to call Monica Lewinsky or any
other witness to testify in the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are hoping that the White House's veiled threats
of a prolonged trial are empty. ``They'd be nuts to carry this
thing on,'' said Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah. ``That was a big
bluff.''

 &HT;    Clemens could still hang his hat in Houston
 &HT;    By Kirk Bohls
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ More than six months ago, when the Houston
Astros front office was deliberating over trades to bolster the
team for the stretch run and was considering aces like Randy
Johnson and Roger Clemens, Larry Dierker made his preferences
known.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them I'd prefer Roger over Randy,'' the Astros'
second-year manager recalled Tuesday in between signing more than
500 autographs during the team's winter caravan stop.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Dierker didn't get his wish. His second choice didn't turn
out all that bad as Johnson won 10 of his 11 decisions, never lost
in the Astrodome and held opponents scoreless in 42 of his 43
innings in games pitched under a roof.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens won his fifth Cy Young Award, which is four more than
Johnson owns.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker still likes Clemens, especially since Johnson took his
talented left arm and windmill frame to Arizona's greener pastures.
Clemens remains in Toronto _ for now. Curiously enough, Dierker and
Clemens will be united, at least temporarily, when both are
inducted tonight into the Texas Sports Hall of Fame at a banquet in
Waco.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he expects Clemens to be a Blue Jay when the season
opens in April, Dierker said, ``From what people are telling me,
probably not. It still may be possible (for him to be an Astro),''
said Dierker, who was named the National League Manager of the Year
for directing Houston to 102 wins and a playoff appearance _
albeit, a brief one _ against San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told our people I liked Roger because he's a more vocal guy
than Randy. He's a very dominant personality and has a similar
domineering personality. The two go together. He's an extremely
successful person who doesn't accept anything less, and that part
of him is what makes him great.''
</P>
<P>
   The bet here is Clemens will become an Astro, maybe by the time
pitchers report to spring training Feb. 17. Houston has all but
listed future Cy Young candidate Scott Elarton and budding outfield
star Richard Hidalgo off-limits in talks with the Blue Jays, but
don't rule out a trade that would send outfielder Derek Bell, a
pitcher such as Jose Lima or Sean Bergman and a minor-league
prospect. The Astros could even wind up with outfielder Jose Cruz
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   You might remember that the Astros flirted with Clemens last
month after the former Texas Longhorns pitcher told Toronto he
wished to be traded to a contender, preferably one closer to his
home, which just happens to be a Jeff Bagwell home run away from
the Astrodome. As All-Star second baseman Craig Biggio described
the previous negotiations Tuesday, ``the way it went down the first
time wasn't that smooth.''
</P>
<P>
   Smooth? The ugly scene between Clemens, his agents and Astros
General Manager Gerry Hunsicker made Latrell Sprewell and P.J.
Carlesimo look like bosom buddies in comparison. First, Houston
lost out on the Big Unit, and then Clemens all but flicked away the
Astros. Hunsicker railed at excessive salary demands in general and
Clemens took it personally, as he always does, and ranted in
return. Astros owner Drayton McLane then added kerosene and
announced he would handle any communications, undermining his own
GM.
</P>
<P>
   But that was adversarial then, and this is peace-and-harmony
now. Clemens extended an olive branch of sorts last week when he
said he'd still love to pitch in an Astros uniform. They haven't
completely kissed and made up, but they're puckering. Clemens would
be wise to take a public page from prodigal Astros son Ken
Caminiti, who rejected Detroit's annual $7 million-plus offer for
Houston's $5 million. Caminiti even let his agent of 11 years go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to come home,'' Caminiti said. ``I didn't really care
about the money. Roger called me and apologized (for the bitter
sound bites) and told me to apologize to the rest of our team. I
know he really wants to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker, reached at a Temple hotel, said the commissioner's
ruling against tampering precludes him from commenting about any
new talks. But he did say the hatchet's as good as buried _ and in
no one's back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had any intent of personally attacking anyone,''
Hunsicker said, ``and I don't feel I did. That's water over the
bridge right now. I'm not one to hold grudges or let anything
interfere with doing what's in the best interests of the ballclub.
I think the ball's in Toronto's court. We've got a club capable of
getting to the World Series, but it's just not as easy without a
dominant pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   A blockbuster trade for Clemens is even more critical in the
aftermath of the payroll-reducing trade of proven catcher Brad
Ausmus to Detroit, weakening Houston behind the plate and leaving a
platoon situation with Tony Eusebio and switch-hitting rookie Mitch
Meluskey. If ever there was a mixed message, it was the decision to
save $2.5 million by unloading Ausmus at the same time the club
still pursues $8 million-a-year Clemens. Even Dierker labeled the
catching move ``very risky.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed,'' Biggio said. ``Usually when you have a
championship team, you want to stay strong up the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   No one could make it stronger than Clemens. And as Dierker said,
``He hasn't gone anywhere else, so no news is good news.''

VISA PROBLEMS DELAY OLOWOKANDI
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM DESERT _ Add at least another 172,800 seconds to the
countdown for Michael Olowokandi's arrival in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   According to agent Bill Duffy, author of an earlier escape from
an early escape-clause deal that released the 7-foot-1 rookie from
the tyranny of shot-happy Italian League guards, a delay in
obtaining a work visa will keep Olowokandi in Milan awhile longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The earliest he'll be there (L.A.) is Friday,'' said Duffy,
who had hoped to deliver Olowokandi by Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   But Jan. 29 is not bad, considering how the original clause in a
three-month deal would have kept his client in Italy through Feb.
15. ``We'll get him there as soon as possible,'' Duffy said. ``I
know he's excited about being with the Clippers.''
</P>
<P>
   A large portion of that excitement may have been established by
leaving Italy and Kinder Bologna, the team that hired the NBA's top
draft pick just before the lockout ended. And even though
Olowokandi will be paid a handsome $480,000 for three weeks of
basketball work, the perimeter-oriented European style of play
didn't exactly showcase his developing skills.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper reports from Italy suggest Olowokandi was another
potential bust for the Clippers museum, but his modest, six-game
stats _ 7.7 points and 5.8 rebounds per game _ were recorded in
only 14 minutes per game. Tendinitis in his right knee had
something to do with that. So did Kinder's reluctance to rely on
Olowokandi after he turned down an updated offer of $5 million to
stay in Italy through June.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, it was a good experience for Michael,'' said Duffy,
who added that his client's knee is fine. ``He did get in game
shape, and I think _ even though things were pretty nice over there
_ he'll really appreciate being in the NBA even more.''
</P>
<P>
   Point in right direction: It appears the responsibility for
putting the ball in the hands of Olowokandi and his teammates will
be given to last year's point guards, the recently re-signed
Darrick Martin and veteran Pooh Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been very pleased with our point guards,'' said new coach
Chris Ford as the team's accelerated training camp was winding down
at College of the Desert. ``They've done everything I've asked at
both ends of the court.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a league source, the possibility of the Clippers
bringing in free-agent point guard Sherman Douglas is slim.
Instead, the team is expected to bank its $3.2 million in cap room.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly: The 5,500 free tickets made available last Saturday for
this Saturday's exhibition game with the Lakers were snapped up in
14 minutes. An estimated 100 fans already were lined up outside the
Sports Arena at 8 a.m., even though the ticket office didn't open
until noon. The team donated another 5,000 tickets for this game to
the L.A. City Parks and Recreation Department.... The Clippers will
practice at the College of the Desert this morning, then return to
L.A. for a workout at the Sports Arena tonight.

OREGON RECRUITS CHOOSE USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC has added to its recruiting class by picking
up two oral commitments from players in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Cook, a 6-foot-5 tight end, and Troy Polamalu, a 5-11
defensive back, decided to attend USC after visiting the campus
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Polamalu is the nephew of former USC fullback Kennedy Pola,
currently an assistant coach at Washington. Polamalu chose USC over
Colorado and Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame was recruiting Cook until he tore the anterior
cruciate ligament in his knee in the seventh game of the season. He
caught 23 passes for 390 yards and four touchdowns. Oregon,
Washington and California were recruiting Cook as well.
</P>
<P>
   USC now has 17 commitments, and is awaiting decisions from about
10 more players, including offensive lineman Lucas MacKay (6-5,
260) of Hughson, Calif., running back Joe Weber (6-2, 210) of San
Bernardino and wide receiver Andre Johnson (6-2, 205) of Miami.

NO ROOM FOR SHELL WITH PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Any chance of Art Shell coming to New England as
assistant head coach apparently ended Tuesday night as former
Carolina assistant Brad Seely accepted an offer to became the
Patriots' special teams coach, according to sources.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Seely, who had a similar offer from the
Cleveland Browns, created a domino effect on Pete Carroll's staff
as former special teams coach Dante Scarnecchia agreed to take over
the offensive line, leaving no place for Shell, who is currently
offensive line coach for the Super Bowl-bound Atlanta Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   After several days of speculation that Shell might end up in New
England, Patriots vice president of personnel Bobby Grier issued an
unusual press release Tuesday night saying Carroll would finalize
his staff in the next 24-48 hours and that Shell would not be a
part of it under any circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said that release came only after Seely notified Carroll
that he would accept New England's offer, which one NFL insider
described as ``a ton of money for a special teams coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the Patriots' offer were unavailable, but the Browns'
offer was for three years at $240,000, $260,000, and $280,000.
</P>
<P>
   In his release, Grier said, ``Art Shell is not being considered
for a position on Pete Carroll's staff. We've made no effort to
contact him. In fact, he's not even available to be contacted by
another team. I expect Pete to finalize his coaching staff within
the next couple of days and I can assure you Art is not a
candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why this started, but quite frankly, I'm sick of
this type of speculation. If you read some of the reports in the
papers, you would believe a deal is already done. This type of
speculation is a distraction to everyone involved and I hate to
even comment on it. I'm sure Art feels the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Seely, a longtime friend and former coaching associate of
Carroll's, also was under consideration by the Baltimore Ravens
until they filled their opening. Carroll told Scarnecchia last week
that he might be shifted to offensive line if Seely came on. After
expressing his reluctance to make such a move and his unhappiness
with the decision to fire previous line coach Paul Boudreau,
Scarnecchia told Carroll he would do whatever he was asked.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Seely had the best special teams unit in the league as
the Panthers stunned the NFL by reaching the NFC Championship Game.
But as the star of head coach Dom Capers began to fade this season,
his staff went with him.
</P>
<P>
   With Seely on board and Scarnecchia running the offensive line,
Shell would be left in the same position he has been in for five
years _ searching for a second chance to coach an NFL team after
winning nearly 60 percent of his games on his first try.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, friends of Shell said that if there was no
offensive line job available in New England, he would have been
unwilling to join Carroll's staff in a supervisory role that lacked
real duties or authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Art is not going to go there just to be a figurehead,'' a
close friend of Shell's said. ``He wants to be a head coach, but
he's not going to New England to stand around all day and look like
he's waiting to replace Pete. That's not who he is. If he goes
there, he wants to help them win, and the way for him to do that is
to coach their line the same way he's coached the Falcons.''
</P>
<P>
   Shell declined to comment on the speculation beyond confirming
that he had not been contacted by the Patriots and saying they had
not asked Falcons head coach Dan Reeves for permission to talk to
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I want is a chance to sit down and talk with someone,''
Shell said. ``If you're asking me do I deserve to be a head coach
in the NFL, the answer is yes. Certainly, it's been disappointing
not to get a second chance because I feel I have something to
offer. The key thing is, I can lead men.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Shell became the first black head coach in 65 years to
lead men in the NFL, and within a year, he was named Coach of the
Year after taking the Raiders to the AFC Championship Game. In his
5 1/2 years, his teams reached the playoffs three times, but he was
fired after a dismal 9-7 season. Since then, the Raiders have not
reached that level again.

   MARIGNANE _ The monster which has stalked French, and European,
politics for the last 15 years was dismembered and divided Sunday:
a Frankenstein movie, played in reverse.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Marie Le Pen will keep the mouth and the spleen of France's
far-right National Front; Bruno Megret will take the legs, brains
and most of the muscle.
</P>
<P>
   A two-day breakaway National Front congress at Marignane, near
Marseilles, began Saturday with whistles, boos and insults for Le
Pen, who was formally deposed as President. Le Pen was invited to
come onto the stage, amid cheers and cat-calls. A spotlight fell on
an empty chair.
</P>
<P>
   Le Pen had refused to attend, mocking the 2,000 congress
delegates as ``pirates and Lilliputians'' (a reference to the
diminutive stature of their leader, the longtime second force in
the Front, Megret).
</P>
<P>
   The Congress, amid baying and rhythmic clapping, declared Le Pen
to have forfeited his leadership of the party by his failure to
turn up. Sunday it elected Megret, 49, as President and claim to be
the true, democratic representative of the French far-right, under
the title ``Front National _ Mouvement National.''
</P>
<P>
   Le Pen, 70, will attempt to rebuild and remodel his rump of the
party as _ more than ever _ a vehicle for his own bloated
self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   Posters for the ``official'' National Front have now dropped the
party's title altogether in favor of an avuncular picture of le
chef and the words ``Jean-Marie Le Pen.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, this is what the six-weeks-old civil war is all
about: on the one hand, Le Pen's belief that he is bigger than the
party; on the other hand, the Megretiste conviction that the party
could be bigger without Le Pen.
</P>
<P>
   One of Megret's lieutenants, Franck Timmermans, read the
impeachment charges against le chef Saturday. (As an additional
insult he referred to the party's founder throughout as ``tu'' not
``vous,'' an impertinent familiarity which he admitted that he
would not have attempted to his face.)
</P>
<P>
   Timmermans accused Le Pen of having cut off the real workers and
brains of the party and listened only to a small band of
``parasites, profiteers and courtesans.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Le Pen had lavished the party's resources on his friends
and family, while keeping the grass roots organizations in penury.
</P>
<P>
   He had ruined the party's electoral chances with ``provocative''
(i.e.: racist) remarks. He had linked the NF to the ``least
respectable'' nationalist parties in eastern Europe, including the
``insane Russian, Vladimir Zhirinovsky.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of these charges _ precisely the charges made by the NF's
enemies _ was received with boos and baying by the Megret
faithful. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 450; OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Who is winning the battle for the French far-right? In the short
term, both men seem destined to lose.
</P>
<P>
   An Ipsos poll for the magazine Le Point last week suggested that
Le Pen might score only 7 percent in June, less than half the NF
score in recent elections.
</P>
<P>
   The polls suggest that Megret's list might score only 4 percent,
which would leave him with no seats. Even the combined total would
be the worst far-right score for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   By independent estimates, Megret has the support of just under
half the party's 42,000 members; 62 out of 104 local branch
secretaries; two out of four NF mayors; 138 out of 273 regional
councillors and _ most surprisingly _ the biggest part of the
Front's boiler-suited and bovver-booted security service.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Courcelle, head of this organization, and Le Pen's
unsmiling shadow for years, was fired by le chef last week. He
announced on Thursday that he was joining Megret.
</P>
<P>
   In broad sociological terms, judging by the attendance at
Marignane Saturday, Megret has the 30- and 40-somethings, the
better educated and the better off.
</P>
<P>
   Le Pen has the support of the NF old guard, the blue-collars and
its failing youth movement. He has the NF headquarters and its bank
accounts (which are likely to be the object of a vicious legal
struggle in coming weeks).
</P>
<P>
   The founder President of the party retains the affection of two
in every three NF voters, but that may change as the strength of
the breakaway becomes clearer.
</P>
<P>
   Le Pen predicts that Megret will not get one percent of the vote
in the European election in June. He may be underestimating Megret
once again. On TV, he is a more convincing and more reassuring
presence than Le Pen (even if his true views on racial issues may
be more extreme).
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, Megret's problem is the presence of three
other, small hard-right, anti-European but more respectable parties
in the European campaign, one of them led by the popular former
Gaullist and former interior minister, Charles Pasqua.
</P>
<P>
   In the longer term, it is just this continuing fragmentation of
the ``traditional'' right in France which could provide Megret with
his big opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   The polls suggest that the total ``nationalist,'' Euro-skeptic
vote _ now divided five ways _ could add up to as much as 30
percent of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   It is Megret's belief that a cleaned-up National Front could
emerge in the new century at the head of an anti-European counter
movement in French politics.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the history of the century just ending
suggests that the French far-right tends to shrink into
insignificance when it turns its talent for hatred against itself. &QL;

   MARIGNANE _ The monster which has stalked French, and European,
politics for the last 15 years was dismembered and divided Sunday:
a Frankenstein movie, played in reverse.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Marie Le Pen will keep the mouth and the spleen of France's
far-right National Front; Bruno Megret will take the legs, brains
and most of the muscle.
</P>
<P>
   A two-day breakaway National Front congress at Marignane, near
Marseilles, began Saturday with whistles, boos and insults for Le
Pen, who was formally deposed as President. Le Pen was invited to
come onto the stage, amid cheers and cat-calls. A spotlight fell on
an empty chair.
</P>
<P>
   Le Pen had refused to attend, mocking the 2,000 congress
delegates as ``pirates and Lilliputians'' (a reference to the
diminutive stature of their leader, the longtime second force in
the Front, Megret).
</P>
<P>
   The Congress, amid baying and rhythmic clapping, declared Le Pen
to have forfeited his leadership of the party by his failure to
turn up. Sunday it elected Megret, 49, as President and claim to be
the true, democratic representative of the French far-right, under
the title ``Front National _ Mouvement National.''
</P>
<P>
   Le Pen, 70, will attempt to rebuild and remodel his rump of the
party as _ more than ever _ a vehicle for his own bloated
self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   Posters for the ``official'' National Front have now dropped the
party's title altogether in favor of an avuncular picture of le
chef and the words ``Jean-Marie Le Pen.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, this is what the six-weeks-old civil war is all
about: on the one hand, Le Pen's belief that he is bigger than the
party; on the other hand, the Megretiste conviction that the party
could be bigger without Le Pen.
</P>
<P>
   One of Megret's lieutenants, Franck Timmermans, read the
impeachment charges against le chef Saturday. (As an additional
insult he referred to the party's founder throughout as ``tu'' not
``vous,'' an impertinent familiarity which he admitted that he
would not have attempted to his face.)
</P>
<P>
   Timmermans accused Le Pen of having cut off the real workers and
brains of the party and listened only to a small band of
``parasites, profiteers and courtesans.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Le Pen had lavished the party's resources on his friends
and family, while keeping the grass roots organizations in penury.
</P>
<P>
   He had ruined the party's electoral chances with ``provocative''
(i.e.: racist) remarks. He had linked the NF to the ``least
respectable'' nationalist parties in eastern Europe, including the
``insane Russian, Vladimir Zhirinovsky.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of these charges _ precisely the charges made by the NF's
enemies _ was received with boos and baying by the Megret
faithful. &QL;

   Who is winning the battle for the French far-right? In the short
term, both men seem destined to lose.
</P>
<P>
   An Ipsos poll for the magazine Le Point last week suggested that
Le Pen might score only 7 percent in June, less than half the NF
score in recent elections.
</P>
<P>
   The polls suggest that Megret's list might score only 4 percent,
which would leave him with no seats. Even the combined total would
be the worst far-right score for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   By independent estimates, Megret has the support of just under
half the party's 42,000 members; 62 out of 104 local branch
secretaries; two out of four NF mayors; 138 out of 273 regional

 By ANDREW MARSHALL  
 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It looks as if, after 12 long months, the greatest
show on earth _ though maybe not the trial of the century _ is
drawing to a close.
</P>
<P>
   As Dale Bumpers, the former Arkansas senator, spoke on Thursday,
there was a strange feeling in Washington, as though a wind were
blowing through the city, or a monsoon were breaking.
</P>
<P>
   The sense of an impending end was palpable; the new age of After
Monica. Maybe not today, or this week, but soon, the impeachment
trial of Bill Clinton will come to an end, either with dismissal or
his acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a bizarre year: one of fascination and compulsion at
times; of deep tedium and perplexity at others. But the lasting
question, and the least satisfying element of the whole thing, is:
what is it all about? What is it all for?
</P>
<P>
   For the President's supporters, it is a right-wing conspiracy, a
partisan attempt to bring down a great man and reverse the
electorate's choice.
</P>
<P>
   For his opponents, it is about the rule of law, the Constitution
and the crimes of a man who should have resigned months ago if he
had any honor.
</P>
<P>
   These competing claims just do not meet in the middle in any
way. They are what social scientists call incommensurable: they
reflect two different world views and sets of moral, political and
legal assumptions that just don't match up.
</P>
<P>
   One way of looking at the significance of the whole affair is
just this: that what has happened is a visible manifestation of the
great kulturkampf between two American value systems, the famous
``Culture Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   This argument holds that since the Sixties, the left-leaning,
liberal, secular, modernizing tide in America has competed against
the traditional, religious, conservative view.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton clearly represents the former for most people, while the
other side has been led by people like Kenneth Starr, Henry Hyde
and Trent Lott, unbending advocates of law and morality (in public,
at least).
</P>
<P>
   The right will argue that After Monica, chaos will come again,
and the dominance of White Anglo-Saxon Protestant ways is over.
This is over-egging it.
</P>
<P>
   Free love is unlikely to break out in the streets of middle
America. Cannabis will not be smoked in public buildings (nothing,
in fact, will be smoked in public buildings, bars or restaurants
below a certain size, for the foreseeable future).
</P>
<P>
   The two main candidates for high office in 2000 will most likely
be two impeccable Wasps: George Walker Bush and Albert Gore.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a bit of stretching to see the events of the last year
as constituting a Rubicon. The nation as a whole has been far from
riveted. But to some extent, that is the point.
</P>
<P>
   For at least two decades, the right _ disproportionately
Southern and Western, white and Baptist _ has been politically
dominant, whatever was going on in the streets of America.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives began their ascent in the Sixties, as the white
majority rejected what it saw as the Democrats' shift to the left.
They had money, ideology and political dominance on their side.
Although the nation changed, Washington, to a remarkable degree,
did not.
</P>
<P>
   The hold that the conservative right had on political debate has
been broken, in the last year, by its inept handling of the debates
in Congress, by the internal wars within the Republican Party, and
by its appalling grasp of public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the conflict has looked rather like the depiction
of the English Civil War in 1066: the Clintonites, like the
Cavaliers, are Wrong but Romantic, whereas the Republicans are
Right but Repulsive.
</P>
<P>
   I do not think that the impeachment of Bill Clinton is the
culminating battle of a great social shift in the U.S. and the end
of the fight over values; I think it is the beginning of another
political change: the rewriting of the Republican Party, which has
come badly unhinged.
</P>
<P>
   The party represents a shard of white, Southern, conservative
opinion that is a minority in America, and has been for decades. If
the Republicans identify that, and that alone, with righteousness,
values and morality, it will make a historic mistake.
</P>
<P>
   If there has been a culture war for the last year, it has been
mainly because the Republicans have forced one _ and they have
lost. They cannot blame the moral malaise or the Sixties for that _
they can only blame themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans find themselves somewhere in between the two
great world views, and are not ready to be dragooned into a war. To
the astonishment of the pollsters and politicians, they express
views of some complexity instead of stark ideological polarization,
as they might have done 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And so they have turned off, which is what, in a few weeks, we
shall all be able to do _ with some relief, but a little
nostalgia. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It looks as if, after 12 long months, the greatest
show on earth _ though maybe not the trial of the century _ is
drawing to a close.
</P>
<P>
   As Dale Bumpers, the former Arkansas senator, spoke on Thursday,
there was a strange feeling in Washington, as though a wind were
blowing through the city, or a monsoon were breaking.
</P>
<P>
   The sense of an impending end was palpable; the new age of After
Monica. Maybe not today, or this week, but soon, the impeachment
trial of Bill Clinton will come to an end, either with dismissal or
his acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a bizarre year: one of fascination and compulsion at
times; of deep tedium and perplexity at others. But the lasting
question, and the least satisfying element of the whole thing, is:
what is it all about? What is it all for?
</P>
<P>
   For the President's supporters, it is a right-wing conspiracy, a
partisan attempt to bring down a great man and reverse the
electorate's choice.
</P>
<P>
   For his opponents, it is about the rule of law, the Constitution
and the crimes of a man who should have resigned months ago if he
had any honor.
</P>
<P>
   These competing claims just do not meet in the middle in any
way. They are what social scientists call incommensurable: they
reflect two different world views and sets of moral, political and
legal assumptions that just don't match up.
</P>
<P>
   One way of looking at the significance of the whole affair is
just this: that what has happened is a visible manifestation of the
great kulturkampf between two American value systems, the famous
``Culture Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   This argument holds that since the Sixties, the left-leaning,
liberal, secular, modernizing tide in America has competed against
the traditional, religious, conservative view.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton clearly represents the former for most people, while the
other side has been led by people like Kenneth Starr, Henry Hyde
and Trent Lott, unbending advocates of law and morality (in public,
at least).
</P>
<P>
   The right will argue that After Monica, chaos will come again,
and the dominance of White Anglo-Saxon Protestant ways is over.
This is over-egging it.
</P>
<P>
   Free love is unlikely to break out in the streets of middle
America. Cannabis will not be smoked in public buildings (nothing,
in fact, will be smoked in public buildings, bars or restaurants
below a certain size, for the foreseeable future).
</P>
<P>
   The two main candidates for high office in 2000 will most likely
be two impeccable Wasps: George Walker Bush and Albert Gore.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a bit of stretching to see the events of the last year
as constituting a Rubicon. The nation as a whole has been far from
riveted. But to some extent, that is the point.
</P>
<P>
   For at least two decades, the right _ disproportionately
Southern and Western, white and Baptist _ has been politically
dominant, whatever was going on in the streets of America.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives began their ascent in the Sixties, as the white
majority rejected what it saw as the Democrats' shift to the left.
They had money, ideology and political dominance on their side.
Although the nation changed, Washington, to a remarkable degree,
did not.
</P>
<P>
   The hold that the conservative right had on political debate has
been broken, in the last year, by its inept handling of the debates
in Congress, by the internal wars within the Republican Party, and
by its appalling grasp of public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the conflict has looked rather like the depiction
of the English Civil War in 1066: the Clintonites, like the
Cavaliers, are Wrong but Romantic, whereas the Republicans are
Right but Repulsive.
</P>
<P>
   I do not think that the impeachment of Bill Clinton is the
culminating battle of a great social shift in the U.S. and the end
of the fight over values; I think it is the beginning of another
political change: the rewriting of the Republican Party, which has
come badly unhinged.
</P>
<P>
   The party represents a shard of white, Southern, conservative
opinion that is a minority in America, and has been for decades. If
the Republicans identify that, and that alone, with righteousness,
values and morality, it will make a historic mistake.
</P>
<P>
   If there has been a culture war for the last year, it has been
mainly because the Republicans have forced one _ and they have
lost. They cannot blame the moral malaise or the Sixties for that _
they can only blame themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans find themselves somewhere in between the two
great world views, and are not ready to be dragooned into a war. To
the astonishment of the pollsters and politicians, they express
views of some complexity instead of stark ideological polarization,
as they might have done 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And so they have turned off, which is what, in a few weeks, we
shall all be able to do _ with some relief, but a little
nostalgia. &QL;

 &HT;    Aftermath of terror told as students recover from deadly crash
 &HT;    (ATTENTION: Florida editors.)

<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ As the school bus carrying 16 Indian River
County grade schoolers slid to a stop after slamming into a citrus
truck Monday, 11-year-old T.J. Adams scrambled toward the front,
past his dead classmate, to the radio.
</P>
<P>
   Just three months ago, the bus driver, Mrs. C., had taught him
to use it if an emergency ever happened.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as children all around him fell silent, stunned by what had
just occurred, T.J. climbed over seats in the flipped bus. Driver
Deborah Colletti lay outside the bus, hurled through the front
window by the collision; the front axle of 1995 Thomas Vista was
ripped from its chassis.
</P>
<P>
   Past bloody handprints and a plastic Halloween pumpkin
half-filled with candy, T.J. reached the radio only to find it
dead.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, children began screaming when ``they looked at
themselves bleeding,'' T.J. said. ``I went out the front window. It
looked like a door.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with 8-year-old Victor Dixon Jr., truck driver Sammie Lee
Hughes, 63, died in the 3:30 p.m. accident. Florida Highway Patrol
troopers investigating the accident erroneously reported a second
student's death late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   All but eight remained hospitalized late Monday. The seven are
expected to fully recover from their injuries, Indian River School
Superintendent Roger Dearing said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses told troopers when Colletti, 36, approached the stop
sign over a narrow bridge, she appeared to keep going. She neither
braked nor stopped, they said. But T.J., who said he was just
putting his Game Boy in his pocket, remembers her stopping several
yards in front of the stop sign as usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``She stopped and I think she looked both ways and didn't see
the truck,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But FHP Cpl. Shirley Lindstadt said the bus drove past the stop
at 45 mph, Colletti didn't even appear to be making a turn when the
crash occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The bus slammed into the tanker being driven by Hughes at about
45 mph. The impact, just behind the driver's side door, crushed the
right side of the tractor and nearly tore it off of its wheels. The
collision spun both vehicles in opposite directions, until the rear
of the bus hit the back half of the trailer. The tractor veered to
the right, plowing cab first into a canal on the west side of 66th
Avenue and throwing Hughes partly through the windshield.
</P>
<P>
   The bus continued to spin until it slammed into a utility pole
near the canal, slid up the pole and then back down, coming to rest
on its right side.
</P>
<P>
   Cpl. Frederick Jones, who is friends with both of those that
died, was first on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a mess,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Later he was asked to identify Dixon's body and then went with
another trooper, who was Dixon's second cousin, to tell the child's
mother that he was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost harder then seeing little Jay laying there
smashed up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The intersection has proved treacherous for drivers because the
narrow bridge requires they stop before the stop sign to make room
for cars turning on to 45th Street, said district Transportation
Director Kathleen Geyer. In fact, two other accidents occurred on
the stretch on Monday, said Sheriff Gary Wheeler.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes time, engineering and money to correct these things.
With the rapid growth of this area, it's difficult to keep up,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fatalities on school buses are rare. In a given year, only about
11 bus drivers and passengers are killed, out of 23.5 million
students transported., according to the National Highway Traffic
and Safety Administration. The investigation is pending. Gov. Jeb
Bush has also asked for federal help in reviewing the case.
Colletti remains in critical condition at Indian River Memorial
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon's family, meanwhile, has gone into seclusion, declining
requests for interviews. Sharon Dixon was busy comforting other
families in a conference room off the emergency room at Indian
River Memorial when she learned her only child had died at the
scene, said Carol Marino, the principal of her son's elementary
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knew when they had her go the conference room. She just
went through this three months ago,'' when her father died, said
neighbor Jennine Dash.
</P>
<P>
   In her small neighborhood, her son's playmates described a quiet
boy, sometimes forced indoors on sunny days by terrible migraines.
Little J's favorite thing, said neighbor Andrea Burt, 12, was
Nintendo. He was expert at Sonic, the fireball spitting cartoon
character, said Sean Durkee, 11.
</P>
<P>
   Across town at the Fat Boy's restaurant, customers mourned the
passing of a regular and a friend, said Durkee's mother, Jessica, a
waitress who has known Hughes for 24 years. Hughes drove for Graves
Brothers Harvesting for two decades and trucks in general for 40
years, said his daughter Debra Smith, who drives buses for the St.
Lucie County School District.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a precious man. So happy, go lucky,'' Durkee said. ``He
always had the same: eggs over medium, bacon, grits and toast.''
</P>
<P>
   In the hours after Monday's accident, school officials
implemented an emergency plan adopted just two months ago.
Initially, school officials frantically tried to identify students
on the bus by tracking down school rosters. At the scene, a
passerby rounded up uninjured children and had them write down
names to keep them occupied, said T.J.'s mother, Fran Adams.
</P>
<P>
   By 9:45 p.m. all had been accounted for and teachers and other
officials contacted, Marino said. Tuesday morning, nine counselors
went to Rosewood Elementary and 12 to Osceola. Counselors were also
available to teachers and drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Parents dropping off students Tuesday said their children were
fearful of riding the bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shock. My kids have friends on the bus. My daughter
knows Victor,'' said Kathy Price, whose two children ride the bus
but were not on it Monday. ``The kids told me Mrs. C., the bus
driver, was very safe. They just loved her.''
</P>
<P>
   For students on the bus, many were concerned about Colletti.
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Johnson, 7, who was flown to St. Mary's Medical Center in
West Palm Beach asked immediately ``how is my bus driver,'' Geyer
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had a very good rapport with the children,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Colletti drove for the district from 1991 to 1993 before moving
back to her hometown in Falls River, N.J., where she also drove a
bus for the local district.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was an excellent driver who was always willing to do what
was needed,'' said district spokeswoman Pat Hanlon.
</P>
<P>
   Colletti returned to Vero Beach and resumed driving, picking up
the route she was driving Monday more than a year and a half ago,
Geyer said. Records show she received over 40 hours of training
initially and underwent eight hours of additional training in
August.
</P>
<P>
   Records also show the three-year-old bus with more than 63,000
miles passed its last monthly inspection in November when its
brakes were adjusted along with some other minor repairs.
</P>
<P>
   For Superintendent Dearing, the accident was particularly
disturbing: just six months ago his 20-year-old daughter was left
paralyzed after the family's car collided with a car on a trip to
Miami. Dearing assured families that the district's risk management
department would handle insurance matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our thoughts right now are with the family of Mr. Hughes and
of course the little boy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   David Falzarano, 7, and Ryan Besancon, 9, were both in
satisfactory condition and Colletti remained in critical condition
at Indian River Memorial Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor Rosemond, 7, was in good condition at Arnold Palmer
Hospital for Women and Children in Orlando. Tyler Griffin, 6, was
in stable condition at Holmes Regional Medical Center in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
   Clay Haywood, 11, of Vero Beach and Johnson of Fellsmere were in
stable condition and being moved into a regular pediatric ward at
St. Mary's.
