<HEADLINE> UN Praises African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
noted "with deep satisfaction" the signature of the African
Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty (the Treaty of Pelindaba) Thursday
in Cairo, Egypt, according to a council presidential statement.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Juan Somavia of Chile, president of the council for
April, said in the statement that the Security Council considered
the signature of the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty
constituted an important contribution by the African countries to
the maintenance of international peace and security.
</P>
<P>
"This historic event marks a successful formalization of the
commitment undertaken 32 years ago when the leaders of Africa
adopted in July 1964 in Cairo the pioneering resolution of the
First Ordinary Session of the Assembly of the Heads of State and
Government of the Organization of African Unity, which declared
Africa a denuclearized zone," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the treaty by more than 40 African countries and
the signing of the relevant protocols by the nuclear-weapon states
constituted important steps towards the effective and early
implementation of the treaty, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The council emphasized the importance of early ratification of
the treaty with a view to securing its rapid entry into force, the
statement added.

ANKARA, April (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz
will fly to Baku Sunday for a two-day official visit at the
invitation of Azeri President Geidar Aliyev, the Anatolia News
Agency reported today.

<P>
The Turkish premier is also expected to meet with leaders of

Local newspapers in Baku have reported the scheduled visit on
front pages, saying Yilmaz's visit was of special importance at a
time when Russia was trying to increase its influence on the
Turkic republics.
</P>
<P>
Some editorials noted that the visit shows Ankara's support to
Azerbaijan, the only republic of the former Soviet Union that
rejects Moscow's efforts to increase its power in the region.

<HEADLINE> Swazi Protesters Demand Repeal Of Royal Decree </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 12 (Xinhua) -- About 100 members of the
Swaziland Democratic Alliance today marched to the office of
Prime Minister Prince Mbilini Dlamini to hand over a memorandum
demanding the repeal of the royal decree of 1973.
</P>
<P>
According to the South African Press Association, the
protesting march, banned by the Swazi government on Thursday, was
called by anti-government political formations, including the
Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions, the Swaziland Youth
Congress and the illegal People's United Democratic Movement.
</P>
<P>
Today is the 23rd anniversary of the royal decree which banned
all political parties in Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
On April 12, 1973, Swaziland King Mswati III's father, the
late King Sobhuza II, suspended the kingdom's 1968 Independence
Constitution and banned all political parties in a royal decree.
</P>
<P>
Human Rights Association of Swaziland executive officer Simon
Noge said in Mbabane that the alliance expected the decree to be
repealed "in the same manner that the Independence Constitution
was repealed in 1973".
</P>
<P>
Noge said a mass rally of about 3000 members of the 13 civic
groups which signed the memorandum would converge on the
parliamentary buildings on Saturday to hear the results of
today's demand.
</P>
<P>
"We've informed the police of our marches and have asked them
to monitor violence, but we expect the rally to be peaceful,"
added Noge.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland, a land-locked country surrounded by South Africa
and Mozambique, is the only southern African country where
political party activities are banned by the 23-year-old decree.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Pledges to Continue Reform Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Li Peng
said today in Paris that China will continue its policies of
reform and opening to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Addressing French business and industrial leaders at a
welcoming banquet, Li said a macro economic control system has
taken shape in China to keep pace with the development of the
market economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Centering on the reform of state-owned enterprises, China is
continuing to reform its economic system and will have set up a
basic socialist market economic system by the end of this century,
Li said.
</P>
<P>
Li turned down the allegation by some people that China stops
short of political reforms, saying this is not the fact.
</P>
<P>
China has also attached great importance to political reform,
he said. But democratic political system in China cannot resemble
that in western countries, as it is not suited to the reality of
China's situation, Li added.
</P>
<P>
China has adopted many international practices in technology
exchange and economic cooperation with other nations, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the year, China has halved its tariffs
to an average of 23 percent and will continue to make efforts to
reduce them, the Premier said.
</P>
<P>
China, a giant market for foreign investors and businesses, is
strengthening its agricultural, energy, transportation and
communications sectors, while developing pillar industries,
including electronics, automobile, construction and hi-tech, Li
said.
</P>
<P>
Li welcomed foreign businesses to invest in China, saying the
investment environment has continuously improved and said China's
progress will make positive contribution to world peace, stability
and development.
</P>
<P>
The premier also recalled China's economic achievements during
the period of the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995), saying the
gross national product during that time increased by an average of
12 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
These achievements show that China has found an appropriate
path for development with its own characteristics. That is, to
establish a socialist market economy, said the premier.
</P>
<P>
Li also pledged to maintain long-term stability in China and
expressed his confidence in keeping to an annual economic growth
rate of eight percent in the coming five years and seven percent
in the first decade of the next century.

<HEADLINE> Nixon's All 3,700-Hour Tapes to Be Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. President Richard
Nixon's estate agreed today to release almost 3,700 hours of
still-unheard tapes made by Nixon while he was in the White House,
including many relating to the Watergate scandal that ended his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
The first release of some 201 hours of the tapes is expected in
November and another release of 278 hours of tapings recorded in
the White House Cabinet Room will be followed, with a time not
set, according to a report by the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
To date, only 63 hours of tapes had been available for public
listening.
</P>
<P>
Secret taping systems that recorded both conversations on the
telephone and among people in the Oval Office and other locations
were revealed during Senate Watergate hearings and contents of the
tapes ultimately led to a House Judiciary Committee vote
recommending Nixon's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974, rather than be impeached.
</P>
<P>
The Nixon estate agreed to allow future releases even though
the issue of whether the National Archives is entitled to keep
both originals and copies of tape segments of purely private
conversations has not been resolved.

<HEADLINE> Tunisia to Host Conference of International Federation of Air Traffic Controllers Associations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Tunisia is scheduled to host the
35th conference of the International Federation of Air Traffic
Controllers Associations (IFATCA) due to he held between April 15
and 19.
</P>
<P>
Some 650 representatives from 70 societies specialized in civil
aviation will attend the conference and the technical exhibition
of the IFATCA, said its chief Briben Lorbedson at a press briefing
here today.
</P>
<P>
The conference will discuss the professional and administrative
problems of the federation and review the major technical
developments in the field of aviation during last few years,
Lorbedson said.
</P>
<P>
Controlling air traffic is no longer an internal affair of the
world countries, it is rather an international question involving
satellites, he added.
</P>
<P>
The IFATCA official highlighted importance of cooperation among
different countries in this field to ensure the safety of air
personnel.
</P>
<P>
The conference will hold meetings in camera, grouping the
concerned national associations to discuss issues related to the
standards of air traffic especially in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Some of such standards have not come into effect so far in some
African countries due to lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
The international federation, a non-governmental, was
established in 1961 and its members total 105. It aims to ensure
the safety of air traffic and coordinate the systems of civil
aviation.
</P>
<P>
Established on April 28, 1970, the Tunisian Association of Air
Traffic Controllers joined the organization in 1977. It includes
163 observers, 8 percent of them being women.

ANKARA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Jose Cutileiro, Secretary-General
of the Western European Union (WEU), the defense arm of the

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Minister of Transport
Maj. General Ibtahim Gumel said here today that all the budgetary
allocation to the ministry this year would be used to consolidate
and complete all on-going government projects under the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The 7.1 billion Naira (about 83.5 million US Dollars) budget
would focus on extensive revitalization of the railway system and
consolidation of infrastructural development of the maritime

</P>
<P>
The funds will also be used to improve the navigability of the
Niger and Benue rivers, the two major rivers in the West African

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Sets Out Proposal for Future Sino-French  Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng today put
forward a four-point proposal for the future development of the
Sino-French relations.
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered to the French industrial and commercial
community in Paris, Li said, the two countries should build trust
and establish long-term stable political relations.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, they should seek further achievements in economic
cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, with each
country complementing the other's strengths and giving full play
to the advantages and potentials of the two economies.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, the two countries should deepen mutual understanding
by developing cooperation and exchanges in the fields of culture,
education and science and technology.
</P>
<P>
They should also shoulder their due responsibilities in
international affairs and work together for the maintenance of
world peace by widening consultation and coordination.
</P>
<P>
China and France, both permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council, are countries of world influence and have significant
responsibilities in world affairs, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Both countries, which treasure their own national independence
and are determined to safeguard their sovereignty, should not
allow other countries to make irresponsible comments on their
internal affairs, he added.
</P>
<P>
Faced with a complex and fast changing international situation,
common ground between the two countries has expanded rather than
shrunk, he said. Even so, it is quite natural for there to be
differences between them.
</P>
<P>
Different countries have different historical backgrounds,
cultures, religions and different levels of economic development.
They cannot be required to follow one mode of development, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The only choice in such circumstances is to conduct
consultations and dialogues on an equal footing with mutual
respect, seeking consensus while reserving differences and aiming
at peaceful coexistence.
</P>
<P>
"I believe, in the spirit of the above, friendly relations
between the two countries will develop in a healthy and steady
manner," said Li.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Chinese and French business communities
have long maintained good cooperation.
</P>
<P>
When certain countries couldn't understand China and unjustly
imposed sanctions in the early 1990s, he recalled, French
entrepreneurs and technicians stayed at their posts in China and
guaranteed the construction of several important projects,
including the Daya Bay nuclear power plant.
</P>
<P>
He said the two economies are highly complementary and there is
still great potential for future cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He urged joint efforts to boost bilateral trade, pointing out
that while trade between the two sides has recovered rapidly in
recent years, it is still well below the economic and trade
capacities of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Sino-French economic and trade cooperation has withstood the
test of time and will undoubtedly witness greater progress in the
future.
</P>
<P>
In his address, the Chinese premier also recalled the history
of the development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Sino-French contact can be traced back to a very early age and
the two peoples enjoy a long history of friendship, he noted.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the century, he said, many Chinese,
including Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping, came to France in search
of the truth to save their nation.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-two years ago, the then French President General Charles
de Gaulle, with the foresight of a true strategist, wisely
established diplomatic relations with China, Li noted. The move
opened up a new era in Sino-French relations and bilateral
cooperation in various fields has witnessed all round development
ever since.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral ties have been through unwelcome, turbulent
times, but that is now history, Li said. What is more important
is to look forward.
</P>
<P>
"We are fully confident that, under the leadership of
Presidents Jiang Zemin and Jacques Chirac, friendly Sino-French
relations, which have a long tradition, will undoubtedly enjoy
stable and healthy development."
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Li referred to his meetings with French leaders
and to the contracts and accords signed between the two countries
worth a total of 2.4 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The most remarkable deals are China's purchase of three Airbus
A340s and 30 Airbus A320s, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also signed a document on joint manufacturing
of 100-140-seater commercial passenger planes.
</P>
<P>
These projects will not only involve cooperation between China
and France, but also the European Union, Li noted.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of equality and mutual benefit and through joint
efforts, cooperation in industrial and hi-tech projects will
undoubtedly succeed, Li said.

<HEADLINE> WHO Worries About Meningitis, Cholera in West Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) today expressed its concern at the spreading epidemics of
meningitis and cholera in West Africa since early this year.
</P>
<P>
According to WHO statistics, since January alone, there have
already been more cases of meningitis reported in Africa than in
any year since 1989. Of the nearly 74,000 cases and 9,000 deaths
reported in 1996, more than 95 percent are in four countries of
West Africa -- Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
WHO experts also noted that the incidence of cholera in Africa
had shifted in recent years from the eastern and southern regions
to the western part of the continent.
</P>
<P>
In 1993 only three countries in West Africa reported cases of
cholera. By 1995, the number of countries reporting the disease in
the region had jumped to 11.
</P>
<P>
Of the 17,500 cases of cholera and 1,105 deaths which had been
reported in Africa so far in 1996, more than two-thirds had
occurred in West African countries, with the largest numbers being
in Nigeria, the WHO said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. health agency pointed out that the spread of cholera
in West Africa was associated with crowded living conditions and
poor hygiene. The disease spread along roads and rivers, in large
gatherings such as pilgrimages and feasts, and through mass
movements of populations.
</P>
<P>
WHO epidemiologists and logisticians are currently in Nigeria
and Burkina Faso to assist national authorities to review and
improve strategies to control meningitis and cholera. The
organization has also prepared a plan to improve surveillance
control measures against the two epidemics on a regional basis.

<HEADLINE> China Hopes to Expand Economic Cooperation With  Canada: NPC Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TORONTO, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) of
China, said today that his country hopes to further expand
economic and technological cooperation with Canada.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at a luncheon here today hosted by the Canada-China
Business Council, Qiao said that at present, the Sino-Canadian
trade volume is incompatible with the economic scale or
development needs of the two countries, and that there exists huge
potential for further expansion of the two-way trade.
</P>
<P>
Last year, bilateral trade reached a historical high of 4.214
billion U.S. dollars, up by 29.8 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
"Canada is an economically developed, technologically advanced
and financially strong country in the world, while China enjoys a
rapid economic growth and represents a huge market," said Qiao,
who is here on a 10-day official goodwill visit.
</P>
<P>
He noted Canada's edge in such fields as nuclear energy,
hydropower, telecommunications, transportation, agriculture,
environmental protection and raw material industry, which he said
are exactly the priority sectors in his country's development
endeavor for a fairly long period of time to come.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to see more investment and closer cooperation from the
Canadian business community," Qiao told a crowd of some 200
Canadian officials and businessmen.
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that so long as the two business communities as
well as the competent authorities of the two countries work
together unremittingly, our economic cooperation and trade will
develop to a new level," he said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, Canada had directly invested in 2,727
projects in China, with contractual investments valued at 3.66
billion U.S. dollars. Meanwhile, Canada has become one of the
largest recipient countries of China's investment overseas.

TORONTO, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) of
China, said here today that his country "will be able to provide
adequate food to its population with its own efforts."
</P>
<P>
Qiao made the statement in a speech at a luncheon here today

China, a country with 22 percent of the world's population with

agricultural products, and that there is a great demand for better
quality, Qiao stressed that China's agriculture has a "huge
potential and a promising future."
</P>
<P>
Two thirds of the existing farmland in China is of medium and
low yield. It is estimated that the yield might go up by about 50
percent with the extension and application of the scientific and
technological research results and applied techniques that China
has already developed, he said.
</P>
<P>
With 33 million acres of waste land and 330 million acres of
waste mountains, slopes and shoals to be developed and harnessed
for farming, China's farm produce will also rise considerably.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China will implement series of policies and
measures to strengthen agriculture, which will also include
developing stable commodity grain bases, intensifying efforts in
water conservancy projects, giving science and technology a
greater role to play in developing agriculture and stepping up the
development of agriculture-related industries.
</P>
<P>
"It is a priority of our economic efforts for the coming 15
years to ensure a sustained and steady growth in agricultural
production," Qiao noted.
</P>
<P>
"According to our plan, by the year 2000, the total grain
output should reach 490 to 500 billion kg, and new progress should
be made in other agricultural areas," Qiao told the audience.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that China will be able to provide adequate
food to its population with its own efforts," the NPC chairman
stressed.
</P>
<P>
While solving its problems in the agricultural field on its
own, China will continue to vigorously promote foreign trade,
introduce foreign investment, advanced technology and fine strains
of farm produce, and learn good experience, with a view to further
expanding cooperation with the rest of the world, he added.

<HEADLINE> China Will Pose No Threat to Other Countries: NPC Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TORONTO, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) of
China, said today that his country will pose no threat to other
countries now, nor in the future when it is developed.
</P>
<P>
Qiao made the pledge in a speech at a luncheon here today
hosted by the Canada-China Business Council. Qiao is here on a
10-day official goodwill visit to Canada.
</P>
<P>
"China poses no threat to other countries now, nor when it is
developed with an increased aggregate national strength," Qiao
noted.
</P>
<P>
"China resolutely opposes all forms of hegemonism. China will
never seek to be a superpower," Qiao said. "In fact, a stable and
developed China is an indispensable factor for world peace,
stability and development" and will "reinforce the forces making
for world peace," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Proceeding from our own historical experience and present
position, we highly cherish our hard-won independence and freedom
as well as the peaceful international environment," the NPC
chairman noted.
</P>
<P>
China will forever live in amity with the rest of the world on
the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and
unswervingly work for world peace and development, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the speech, Qiao conceded that it will take a long time to
realize modernization in his populous country with a weak
foundation, a low economic development level, uneven development,
low per capita GNP and a large rural population, of which around
65 million are still struggling below the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
"Many difficulties and challenges will present themselves in
our way ahead," Qiao said.
</P>
<P>
However, looking into the future, the Chinese government and
people have full confidence in turning China into a prosperous,
democratic and modern socialist country with advanced culture, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Calls for Closer Ties Between China, Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is ready to
work with west European countries to push cooperation to a higher
level, Chinese Premier Li Peng told leading French businesspeople
in Paris on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Li said that both China and the European Union (EU) should play
a larger role in international affairs in what is becoming an
increasingly multipolarized world no longer dominated by a single
country.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between Asia and Europe involves on the one hand
one group of nations with huge markets, rapid growth, abundant
natural resources and large population, and on the other, a group
backed by powerful economic strength, advanced technology and
financial resources, Li noted.
</P>
<P>
Such cooperation, he continued, "will not only benefit the
people of the two continents but will also be conducive to
building a just and rational international political and economic
order, and contribute to peace, stability and development in the
21st century."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the four principles of China's policy with Europe
proposed by Chinese President Jiang Zemin during his visit to
France in September 1994.
</P>
<P>
These are: development of an endurable and stable relationship
of friendly cooperation to meet the needs of the 21st century;
mutual respect and seeking common ground while preserving
differences; common development based on mutual benefit and mutual
support of the other country's needs; strengthening consultation
and cooperation in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
"The principles reflect China's emphasis and good faith in
developing its ties with Europe," Li said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that relations between China and Europe have
made further progress over the last few years.
</P>
<P>
Economic and trade cooperation is increasing and west Europe
has become an important trading partner for China.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the Chinese government show that trade
volume between China and west Europe in 1995 rose by 18.3 percent
over 1994 to a record 42.1 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
As exchange visits at senior level and contacts in various
fields have increased, a mechanism for political dialogue and
consultation has been established, said Li.
</P>
<P>
Li arrived in Paris on Tuesday for a five-day visit at the
invitation of the French government.

<HEADLINE> WHO Worries About Health Situation in Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
said today that renewed fighting in Liberia is seriously hampering
provision of health care services to hundreds of thousands of
people in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
A WHO report issued today said that health care services in
Liberia had been precarious at best for some time, but in the
capital city of Monrovia they had collapsed with the upsurge in
fighting in the city during the past week.
</P>
<P>
International agencies, including the WHO, which had been
providing many of the health care services were being forced to
implement partial evacuations of personnel. "Providing emergency
assistance to the local population is all but impossible at
present," the WHO said.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N. health agency, major stocks of medical
supplies had been looted in Monrovia and new supplies must be
channeled through Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The WHO, along with other U.N. agencies, was preparing a joint
list of urgent humanitarian needs for Liberia. The health sector
plan included arrangements for the removal and safe burial of
corpses to prevent epidemics, the WHO said.

<HEADLINE> WHO Worries About Meningitis, Cholera in West Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) today expressed its concern at the spreading epidemics of
meningitis and cholera in West Africa since early this year.
</P>
<P>
According to WHO statistics, since January alone, there have
already been more cases of meningitis reported in Africa than in
any year since 1989. Of the nearly 74,000 cases and 9,000 deaths
reported in 1996, more than 95 percent are in four countries of
West Africa -- Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
WHO experts also noted that the incidence of cholera in Africa
had shifted in recent years from the eastern and southern regions
to the western part of the continent.
</P>
<P>
In 1993 only three countries in West Africa reported cases of
cholera. By 1995, the number of countries reporting the disease in
the region had jumped to 11.
</P>
<P>
Of the 17,500 cases of cholera and 1,105 deaths which had been
reported in Africa so far in 1996, more than two-thirds had
occurred in West African countries, with the largest numbers being
in Nigeria, the WHO said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. health agency pointed out that the spread of cholera
in West Africa was associated with crowded living conditions and
poor hygiene. The disease spread along roads and rivers, in large
gatherings such as pilgrimages and feasts, and through mass
movements of populations.
</P>
<P>
WHO epidemiologists and logisticians are currently in Nigeria
and Burkina Faso to assist national authorities to review and
improve strategies to control meningitis and cholera. The
organization has also prepared a plan to improve surveillance
control measures against the two epidemics on a regional basis.

<HEADLINE> Peres Vows to Retaliate against Hezbollah Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres today defended his country's right to shell Hezbollah (Party
of God) targets inside Lebanon, saying Israel would retaliate
against any further Hezbollah attacks on Israeli targets.
</P>
<P>
Peres's remarks came after Israeli air force helicopters
carried out attacks this afternoon on Hezbollah positions deep
inside Lebanon, in retaliation for the Hezbollah Katyusha rocket
attacks against northern Israel this morning.
</P>
<P>
At least four Israeli civilians were wounded in this morning's
Katyusha attacks on the Israeli northern town of Kiryat Shemona
near the Lebanese border.
</P>
<P>
Later this afternoon, the Shiite Moslem guerrilla group
Hezbollah fired two more rounds of Katyusha rockets on the
panhandle area of Galilee of northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Peres, speaking at a press conference in the north, blamed the
Hezbollah for trying to destroy Lebanon, saying that despite
claims that it is protecting southern Lebanese villages, the
Hezbollah only brings catastrophe to the people in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"Israel has never surrendered to war of terror," said Peres,
"if the Hezbollah thinks it can impose upon us a move or a change
by terrorist attacks, they will learn quickly that it is totally
wrong."
</P>
<P>
Peres called on the Lebanese government to defend its
sovereignty by cracking down on terrorist organizations in that
country.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that Israeli warplanes this afternoon
bombarded Hezbollah targets south of Beirut, the second time in
two days to attack positions in the Lebanese capital.
</P>
<P>
Israeli helicopters and artillery today also attacked villages
north of the "security zone" in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, thousands of Lebanese residents are reportedly
fleeing the region after Israel issued a statement saying that it
would start shelling 49 towns and villages in south Lebanon this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the 1,100-square-kilometer "security zone"
in south Lebanon in 1985 as a buffer against cross-border
guerrilla attacks on its northern Jewish settlements. South
Lebanon has so far become the only active Arab-Israeli war front.

<HEADLINE> Mandela, Buthelezi Discuss Kwazulu/Natal Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 12 (Xinhua) -- President Nelson Mandela
today consulted Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu
Buthelezi by phone about postponing or staggering the local
government elections scheduled for May 29 in Kwazulu/Natal
Province.
</P>
<P>
during the conversation, Mandela and Buthelezi agreed to meet
in Cape Town next week to discuss the polls.
</P>
<P>
However, the two leaders had not discussed Mandela's statement
on Thursday that the polls might have to be staggered or
postponed because of violence and intimidation in the province.
</P>
<P>
Mandela made the statement in Pretoria after having been
briefed by Provincial Affairs and Constitutional Development
Minister Chris Fismer and his deputy Valli Moosa on the situation
in Kwazulu/Natal which could jeopardise the polls.
</P>
<P>
The president said afterwards that the date of the forthcoming
local polls in the province would have to be reconsidered, but
all parties would be consulted before a final decision was taken.
</P>
<P>
But Buthelezi insisted that Kwazulu/Natal local government
elections should go ahead on May 29.
</P>
<P>
"I am totally and utterly opposed to any postponement or
staggering," said Buthelezi, adding he endorsed calls by
Kwazulu/Natal Provincial Government Premier Frank Mdlalose for
the polls to proceed as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Although worried about intimidation in Kwazulu/Natal,
Buthelezi said the 1994 general election should be used as a
barometer for the local polls.
</P>
<P>
The Inkatha leader said the 1994 elections had passed
peacefully in the province despite violence and intimidation.
Therefore, there was no reason why these conditions should now
scupper the local polls.
</P>
<P>
While confirming the meeting between Mandela and Buthelezi
would take place next week, Presidential Spokesman Joel
Netshitenzhe said in Cape Town that the president was still
trying to consult Deputy President and National Party leader F.
W. de Klerk, who was out of town.
</P>
<P>
De Klerk's Spokeswoman Isobet Oberholzer said the deputy
president had already spoken to Mandela on Thursday and had also
discussed the matter with Buthelezi, but could not elaborate on
the nature of the talks.

TORONTO, April 12 (Xinhua) -- China is confident of its
ability to feed its people, Qiao Shi, chairman of the Chinese

</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Allan Mclean, parliamentary speaker of
Ontario Province, Qiao denied reports that China would face a food
crisis in the next century and said it was confident about the
security of food supplies.
</P>
<P>
Mclean said his parliament, as a forum to discuss public
affairs, would like to help promote cooperation with China in
economic, trade and other fields.
</P>
<P>
Qiao, who flew to Canada on Thursday after a four-day official
good-will visit to Cuba, said China and Canada are enjoying good
relations, especially in economic links.
</P>
<P>
He added the friendly ties between Ontario and its Chinese
sister province, Jiangsu, should be further developed.
</P>
<P>
Canada is the final leg of Qiao's five-nation tour, which has
already taken him to Ukraine, Russia, Greece and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Besides Toronto, Qiao will also tour the Canadian capital
Ottawa, Regina, Winnipeg and Vancouver.

<HEADLINE> UK Education Minister Stresses Discipline in School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Education and Employment
Secretary Gillian Shephard warned today that the parents of
violent or disruptive pupils who have been expelled twice from
school may lose the right to choose their school.
</P>
<P>
The education secretary made this announcement at the annual
conference of the National Association of Schoolmaster/Union of
Women Teachers (NAS/UWT), the second largest teaching union in
Britain, in Glassgow.
</P>
<P>
She said this decision would require special legislation.
</P>
<P>
She further stressed that raising education standards was her
government's highest priority and that required good discipline in
schools.
</P>
<P>
However, her announcement undoubtedly was in conformity to the
wishes of teachers.
</P>
<P>
Ten days ago, Nigel de Cruchy, general secretary of the NAS/UWT,
called for the discipline of parents who encourage disruptive
children to disbehave.
</P>
<P>
He also called for new laws to ensure that schools invest in
the surveillance system to protect against intruders.
</P>
<P>
On April 2, another teaching union, the Association of Teachers
and Lecturers (ATL), at its annual conference urged the setting up
of local groups in their communities to tackle the worsening
school violence.
</P>
<P>
The association said that schools would be the starting point
for dealing with crime in society.
</P>
<P>
It asked parents, police and church officials to organize
themselves into local groups to check the school violence.
</P>
<P>
Now violence against teachers and false allegations of abuse by
pupils have been put high on the agenda at the Easter season
conferences of Britain's teaching unions.

</P>
<P>
Alvis, Britain's leading specialist in light armored vehicles,
is expected to make specialist variants for the British Army.
</P>
<P>
Alvis Chairman Nick Prest reportedly said Alvis's share in the
European program would be significant and the deal is a
breakthrough for Alvis as the British company has failed to secure
a German partner to mount an independent bid.
</P>
<P>
The collaboration is part of a wide-ranging shake-up in the
European armored vehicles industry and this is the first common
procurement of the European Arms Agency.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some companies from Britain, France and Germany
will take part in another bid to supply some 8,000 light, wheeled
personnel carriers.

<HEADLINE> Situation in Monrovia "Anarchy:" UNHCR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) today said the situation in the
Liberian capital of Monrovia was "anarchy" and the U.N. began to
withdraw its staff this morning.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made following "repeated raids on the UNHCR
compound" and threats of further attacks, a UNHCR spokeswoman told
a news conference this morning.
</P>
<P>
Armed gangs forced into the UNHCR compound and took away
vehicles and radio equipment and threatened further attacks,
according to her. "The situation was becoming untenable," she
added.
</P>
<P>
She said the compound should be empty this afternoon and it has
been sheltering some 150 civilians since the fresh outbreak of
fighting in Liberia last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
She added at least one of the UNHCR staff members will remain
in Monrovia and open an office in the safer suburbs.
</P>
<P>
"There is almost a complete anarchy in Monrovia" with bodies in
the street and "wanton carnage" occurred, said she, who expressed
the UNHCR's concern about the situation of refugees and the
Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in and around the capital.
</P>
<P>
According to her, however, the anarchy put the UNHCR staff in
evident danger and due to the extremely limited ability to move
around the city, the UNHCR could do very little practically at the
moment in helping these people.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR reports said that there are about 800,000 IDPs in and
around Monrovia as well as some 7,000 of a total of about 120,000
Sierra Leonean refugees in the country.
</P>
<P>
The World Food Program, the food aid organization of the United
Nations, is also warning in a report of an expansion of food
shortage from Monrovia to the rest of Liberia.
</P>
<P>
In Monrovia, "the fighting and on-going massive looting of
homes, markets and shops has sparked off widespread food shortages
for civilians," a WFP top official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"A serious humanitarian crisis is likely to erupt if fighting
continues and humanitarian organizations cannot have safe access
to the affected populations," he added.
</P>
<P>
At the news conference this morning, U.N. spokeswoman Therese
Gastaut said that the United Nations has also decided to remove
its non-essential staff out of Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has 233 civilian staff members in Liberia,
including 92 military observersion, 73 of them in Monrovia.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: 18 Wounded in Second Israeli Air Raid at Beirut's south Suburbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 12 (Xinhua) -- About 18 people, including a
Syrian officer and a Syrian soldier, were wounded in an air raid
carried out by Israeli warplanes at 3:00 p.m. (12:00 GMT) at
Beirut's south suburbs, according to Red Cross sources
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said six Israeli helicopters fired air-to-surface
missiles and machineguns at targets near the airport road, black
smokes rose over the area, and echos of explosions were heard at
every corner in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Police sources reported that the Israeli helicopters launched
nine air-to-surface missiles at positions of the Lebanese army and
Syrian forces in the area, and hit the target of a post of the
Syrian forces.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Red Cross sources reported that some 18 people,
including a Syrian officer and a soldier, were wounded in the air
raid, the second at Beirut's south suburbs in two days.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese army command announced in a statement issued
late this afternoon that Israeli helicopters launched at 3:00 p.m.
two air raids, being five minutes apart, at targets in Beirut's
south suburbs.
</P>
<P>
The Beirut International Airport locating in the area was
forced to temporarily stop its operation, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
This was the first Israeli air raid directly targeting
positions of the Lebanese army and the Syrian forces in Lebanon
since an Israeli large-scale aggression in Lebanon in 1982.
</P>
<P>
There are about 35,000 Syrian troops in Lebanon under the name
of the "Arab Deterrent Force," most of them are stationing in
Lebanon's eastern Beqaa Valley and in the capital.
</P>
<P>
This was also the second Israeli raid at Beirut's south
suburbs in two days. Six people were wounded in another air raid
at the same area Thursday, one of whom died from the serious wound
a couple of hours later.
</P>
<P>
Since early hours this morning, Israeli forces fired heavy
artilleries at a number of targets in south Lebanon. Israeli
warplanes also bombarded a series of villages in the region,
killing 8 people and wounding some 30 others, according to a
preliminary statistics of Lebanese security sources.
</P>
<P>
Israeli helicopters attacked this afternoon an position of the
Lebanese army near the southern Lebanese port city of Sour.
</P>
<P>
Security sources reported that the Israeli helicopters fired
more than 10 air-to-surface missiles at the Lebanese army
position.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Radio ordered local residents in 41 towns and villages
opposite the so-called "security zone" to leave their houses
before 2:30 p.m. local time (11:30 GMT), announcing that Israeli
forces would bombarded these towns and villages at that time.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Radio extended later the ultimatum for a two hours.
</P>
<P>
But the warning has forced thousands of local residents to
leave their houses and surged toward the south port cities of
Sour and Saida. The Lebanese army has to set up a blockade on
the road leading from Saida to Beirut in order to disperse the
exodus.
</P>
<P>
In a retaliation for the Israeli aggression, guerrillas of the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, the very alleged target of
the Israeli strikes, launched this morning and in the afternoon,
dozens of Katyusha rockets at the Jewish settlements in northern
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in northern Israel reported that 8 local
residents in the Jewish settlement of Kyriat Shmona were injured
in the Katyusha rocket attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army asked the Jewish settlers in the area to
evacuate in anticipation for more retaliatory attacks.

LUSAKA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Students of Kabwe Trades Training
Institute, who went on a class boycott on Tuesday this week, have
resumed classes, President of the institute's Students Union
Passmore Muunga confirmed today in the central town of Kabwe.
</P>
<P>
The students were protesting against the institute's
administration for not purchasing enough training materials,
Muunga said.
</P>
<P>
The students' tuition fees toward the purchasing of the
training materials were diverted to buying food for the students,
he revealed.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's college students enjoy free food in the institutions
after paying tuition fees.
</P>
<P>
He said before ending the class boycott Thursday, the union
leadership and the administration had reached agreement that
training materials must be bought by the administration before
the third week of every term, or else the students would boycott
classes.

<HEADLINE> U.N. To Launch Second Appeal for DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations is launching
another appeal to aid agencies for humanitarian aid for the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
Continuing severe food shortages, partly caused by floods last
year, led to an appeal for help by the DPRK government earlier this
month, the U.N.'s Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA) said
today.
</P>
<P>
A three-person team will be sent to Pyongyang to put together
draft appeals by U.N. agencies and assess the needs, a spokesman
said, adding that the job might be completed in May.
</P>
<P>
In its last inter-agency appeal, the U.N. received 48 percent
of the 20 million U.S. dollars it wanted to cover the needs for
about 500,000 people hit by the floods, which worsened an already
severe food shortage in the country.

<HEADLINE> Major Vows to Work On Despite By-Election Defeat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 12 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
pledged today that his government must work on although he was
disappointed by a fatal defeat in the Staffordshire South-West
by-election.
</P>
<P>
It was announced early morning that the opposition Labor won a
smashing victory in the by-election with a 22 percent swing,
leaving the Conservative government only a one-seat majority in
the House of Commons.
</P>
<P>
And this was the seventh seat the Tories have lost at
by-elections in the current parliament, four to the Liberal
Democrats, two to Labor and one to the Scottish National Party.
</P>
<P>
At the 1992 general election, the Tory government won a
majority of 21 seats in the 651-seat House of Commons. But seven
by-election defeats and the desertion of three Conservative
members of parliament have whittled that figure down to one.
</P>
<P>
According to reports here, Major said the by-election results
announced today showed that his party still had a lot of work to
do to get its message across.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that he had been in politics long enough not to
over-react to any by-election results.
</P>
<P>
He vowed, "I am here to do what is right and stick with it."
</P>
<P>
After a poor by-election result before the last election, the
Tories went on to win with a huge vote, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the embattled prime minister at the crucial time has
been given a boost by the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) which enjoys
nine seats in parliament.
</P>
<P>
The UUP, the largest Protestant party in Northern Ireland which
strongly defends British rule over the crisis-laden province, has
made a deal with the Tory government on the Ulster affairs and
thus usually backs the Conservatives.
</P>
<P>
UUP party manager Martin Smyth said, "There will be no change
in the path we have taken for years, that we do not see any reason
to terminate the life of the government.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Asian swimming powerhouse China
topped the medal table with four golds, five silver and one bronze
medals on the opening day of the Fifth Asian Swimmng Championships
here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
It seemed that the close gap between China's recent national
champions' tournament and the current championships did not bother
the Chinese swimmers much as they splashed to top honors in most
of the six events.
</P>
<P>
But a packed schedule did affect swimmers as they failed to
produce any new Asian records Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the women's 200 meters freestyle, China's Nian Yun
out-touched national champion Chen Yan to take the title.
</P>
<P>
Nian's winning time of two minutes 1.55 seconds was far away
from the Asian record of 1:56.89 set in 1994 by her fellow
countrywoman Lu Bin.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Suzu Chiba was third.
</P>
<P>
In the men's 200 meters freestyle, Japanese Ito Shunsuke came
from behind to win in 1:53.41, followed by South Korea's Koh
Yun-ho in 1:53.47 and Uzbiekstan's Kabanov Vyacheslav in 1:53.54.
</P>
<P>
China's Asian record holder He Cihong did not compete in her
speciality event of 100 meters backstroke. She was replaced by
Jia Yuanyuan from the Chinese army, who lost to Japan's new star
Nakao Miki by 0.29 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese touched the pad first in 1:02.60, more than two
seconds slower than He's Asian mark.
</P>
<P>
Another Japanese Mai Nakamura was third.
</P>
<P>
It was the Japanese again in the men's 100 meters backstroke as
Konnai Keitaro and Ito Hajime took the top two places in 55.97 and
56.11 seconds, followed by South Korea's Ji Sang-Joon.
</P>
<P>
The Asian standard of the event is 55.05 seconds, set in 1988
by Daichi Suzuki.
</P>
<P>
China's national champion Qu Yun clocked a new Asian
championships record of 2:10.43 to win the women's 200 meters
butterfly final.
</P>
<P>
Chinese world champion Liu Liming holds the event's Asian mark
of 2:06.77 since 1994. Liu did not come for the Asian
championships here.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Yamamoto Takashi took the men's 200 meters butterfly
with a time of 2:02.69, followed by Chinese Xie Xufeng and South
Korean Lee Jeong-Hyung.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, Chinese Fan Huaqiang and Huang Wen finished 1-2
at the men's 100 meter title. Thailand's Oichi Suchart was third.
</P>
<P>
In the women's one-meter springboard final, China's Wu Shunqun
and Li Rongjuan swept the top two spots and Japanese Yukimoto
Buchi was third.
</P>
<P>
The championships will close on Monday.

BRUSSELS, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from 55 nations
and 29 organizations met here today, to put together a 1.2 billion
U.S. dollar aid package for the reconstruction of war-torn Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting, co-sponsored by the European Commission
and the World Bank, is the second Donor's Conference on Bosnia and
aims to raise the remaining 1.2 billion dollars for this year's
reconstruction plan and select priority programs for funding.
</P>
<P>
The first conference last December aimed to secure commitments
of 1.8 billion dollars in emergency aid from countries and
organizations, but only managed to raise a definite 600 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also discuss ways to raise the 5.1 billion
dollars needed to rebuild Bosnia's shattered economy and
infrastructure over the next four years.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Serbs were invited to the meeting but declined to
attend since they insisted on sending a delegation independent of
the Bosnian central government made up of Croat and Muslim
representatives.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Air Force Planes Attack Beirut Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Israel today dispatched air
force helicopter gunships to bombard the Lebanese capital of
Beirut for the second time in a row since it escalated a limited
battle to full war against the Hezbollah guerrillas Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to a war communique issued by the army spokesman,
Israeli helicopter gunships this afternoon flew over southern
Beirut and fired air-to-surface missiles on some neighborhoods
where Hezbollah, or Party of God, has its main command. The
pilots reported accurate hits.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the helicopters were fired upon from ground
and returned fire.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Beirut said that a Syrian army position was hit
and some 12 Syrian soldiers were wounded when Israeli rockets
struck their encampment on the highway leading to the Beirut
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli fighter planes and helicopters also attacked
villages north of the Israel self-styled "security zone" as well
as a refugee camp near the Mediterranean port of Sur (Tyre).
</P>
<P>
Thousands of villagers in south Lebanon began fleeing from
their homes to the north after the Israeli army issued a warning
that it would start bombing as many as 49 towns and villages in
the south this afternoon in retaliation for Hezbollah rocket
attacks against Israel's northern population centers Thursday
and today.
</P>
<P>
The deadline was initially set at 2:30 p.m. local time (11:30
GMT) and subsequently extended to 4:30 p.m. (13:30 GMT). The
warning was broadcast by Voice of the South Radio, controlled by
the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng today
criticized certain countries for hindering China's entry into the
World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with former French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur,
Li said it is unfair that China has so far not been accepted by
the world trade watchdog.
</P>
<P>
Balladur said France is willing to help bring China into the
WTO as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on issues related to China's entry into the WTO at
Balladur's request, Li said that the main obstacle blocking
China's entry into the organization lies with the political
attitude of certain countries.
</P>
<P>
He said China, as a developing country, can only undertake
commitments compatible with the actual level of its economic
development.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, certain countries are demanding China make
the same commitments as those required of developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that China is gradually speeding up the process of
bringing its economic practices into line with the generally
accepted world norms.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Li also said economic cooperation between China
and France should not be confined to large enterprises and that
exchanges and cooperation between small and medium-sized
enterprises should also be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Balladur agreed with Li and expressed his belief that Li's
current visit to France will help strengthen cooperation between
France and China in various fields.

<P>
TEHRAN, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani today denounced Israeli attacks against Lebanon,
calling on Moslem world to undo the disgrace.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said the latest wave of Israeli attacks on Lebanon
was a "shameless act" and "a disgrace for humanity and the world
of Islam."
</P>
<P>
Calling on Moslem countries to break their silence against the
attacks by Israel, Rafsanjani said in his Friday prayer sermons
at Tehran University, "The Islamic world should be in a state of
mourning, and should put pressure on the world and international
organizations against these savage attacks."
</P>
<P>
He regretted the silence of Arab and Moslem countries toward
"such an important issue," saying that "unfortunately, this
silence gives the Zionist regime a green light to continue its
aggression against other Islamic states."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president also censured the United Nations, noting
that civilians are being killed in Lebanon by the Israeli regime,
"but the U.N. expresses only regret toward these sinister acts,
while the United States, which speaks of the new world order,
supports the aggressor."

MOSCOW, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Crime in Russia could be three
times higher than official figures show as only one in three crimes

<P>
Recorded and unrecorded crime is approaching some 10 million a

Almost 35 percent of registered cases remain unsolved, the top

<HEADLINE> "China, Leading Candidate Site for US-German Joint Venture" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The US's Du Pont Company and
Germany's BASF AG are working together to find a suitable site in
Asia for a joint venture between them which will involve about 750
million US dollars in investment.
</P>
<P>
"China will be a leading candidate for the site," Dr. David
J. Pang, vice-president of Du Pont, told a press conference here
today.
</P>
<P>
Du Pont and BASF announced the signing of a letter of intent
Wednesday to establish the joint venture to manufacture and sell
nylon intermediates in Asia. The two companies will start work
immediately with Chinese officials to evaluate sites in China,
Pang said.
</P>
<P>
Sites in other locations in Asia are also being considered, but
China is the largest market in Asia, and so is the prime
candidate, said Pang.
</P>
<P>
Plant construction is scheduled to begin in 1998 and be
completed in 2001. Once operational, the joint venture is expected
to produce approximately 300,000 tons of adiponitrile annually
from butadiene. And it will lead the world in converting the
adiponitrile to caprolactam for nylon 6 production.
</P>
<P>
This joint venture will be built into one of the world's most
competitive nylon intermediates plants, Pang said, adding that it
will mainly serve markets in China, as well as other Asia-Pacific
customers.
</P>
<P>
As one of the world's largest chemical companies, Du Pont
invented nylon in 1935, and began to manufacture nylon products in
1938. Now nearly 30 percent of sales in the global nylon market
are made by Du Pont.
</P>
<P>
With five offices in China, Du Pont has set up three
exclusively-owned enterprises and eight joint ventures here, with
total investment surpassing 300 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Du Pont's total investment in China is estimated to reach one
billion US dollars by the turn of this century.
</P>
<P>
BASF, also a leading global chemicals company, has invested
almost 700 million US dollars in China, making it the biggest
foreign chemical investor in China. It has eight joint ventures in
Shanghai, Nanjing and Shenyang cities, and Jilin Province.

<HEADLINE> Minister Urges Police to Fully Utilize New Laws (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Amendments to the Criminal
Procedure Law and Law on Administrative Punishment, adopted March
17 this year, provide a new legal basis and an effective legal
weapon for China's public security departments nationwide in
cracking down on crime and maintaining social order, a senior
Chinese official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Tao Siju, minister of Public Security, made the remark at a
five-day national conference, attended by high-ranking officials
of public security departments across the country, on the
implementation of the amendments to the two laws.
</P>
<P>
The conference ended today.
</P>
<P>
Tao ordered systematic training of the national police force in
order to improve their understanding of the laws and their
capability of enforcing them.
</P>
<P>
The minister also called on responsible departments within the
sector to revise the ministry's regulations and documents which
are different or in contradictory with the two laws.
</P>
<P>
The adoption of Amendments to the Criminal Procedure Law, which
will become effective at the start of next year, indicates a major
reform and further progress in China's judicial system, said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
By abolishing unsupervised detention of suspects for
investigation by the police and allowing defendants to have access
to lawyers at a much earlier date, the law intends to better
protect the rights and interests of the suspects and observe the
principle that no one shall be deemed guilty until convicted by a
court of law.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Law on Administrative Punishment, which will take effect on
October 1 this year, stipulates a stricter scope and procedure for
law-enforcement agencies, which, the minister said, "is a
challenge for the national police force."
</P>
<P>
He explained, "Such changes as abolishing unsupervised
detention of suspects for investigation may create some
difficulties for police personnel used to old practices.
</P>
<P>
"But as long as police at grassroots level learn the two laws
well, they will have an effective legal weapon that ensures that
they can better crack down on crimes and safeguard the rights and
interests of the people."
</P>
<P>
Touching on the current social order in China, the minister
said that public security departments at all levels should take
advantage of the new legal weapons, intensify crackdowns on
criminal activities and impose severe punishment on people who
commit major crimes, in an attempt to create a better environment
for China's reform, opening-up drive and economic construction.
</P>
<P>
Ren Jianxin, secretary of the Political Science and Law
Committee under the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee,
also delivered a speech at today's meeting, calling for the
national police force to "raise their level of law-enforcement
through the learning of the two laws".

HONG KONG, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Business receipts in most of
Hong Kong's service industries showed increases in value terms in
1995 over 1994, according to official statistics released today.

The transport and storage industries registered the fastest
growth, both by 18 percent, while the hotels and banking
industries grew 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
The release said that the strong growth in the transport
industry was mainly attributable to increase in business of
companies providing cargo forwarding services, while that in the
storage industry was related to a rapid increase in imports and
re-exports.
</P>
<P>
The surge in the banking industry was mainly brought about by
an increase in net interest income, evidenced by growth in total
loans and advances placed.
</P>
<P>
Continued increases in business receipts were also registered
in the industries of import and export, insurance, communications
and business services, according to the release.

<HEADLINE> Four Arrested for Peddling Giant Panda Skin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Police in Shenzhen City in
south China's Guangdong Province have confiscated a giant panda
skin and arrested four people who attempted to sell the skin to a
Hong Kong businessman.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, the four suspects bought the skin in
inland China for 60,000 yuan (about 7,229 US dollars), and
attempted to sell it for 250,000 yuan (about 30,120 dollars).
</P>
<P>
They tried to sell the skin to the unidentified Hong Kong
businessman in a hotel in Shenzhen, which neighbors Hong Kong, but
police arrived and arrested them.
</P>
<P>
The panda skin is one meter long, and is brown and grey in
color.
</P>
<P>
Animal experts said it is extremely rare to find such a
brown-grey giant panda in the country, which now has 1,000 giant
pandas in the wilderness.
</P>
<P>
Last month police in northwest China's Shaanxi Province also
seized a three-colored giant panda skin, and arrested a person for
trying to sell it.

Last June, a Shaanxi farmer, who was found guilty of killing a
giant panda in 1993, was sentenced to life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
China puts giant panda on top of its protection list, and has
passed strict legislation with stiff penalties for those who kill
or sell the rare animal, which is on the verge of extinction.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Grow Vegetables in Desert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
successfully grown spinach, celery, eggplants, tomatoes and other
vegetables in the barren heartland of the Taklimakan Desert in
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
This desert, known as "The Sea of Death" among the local Uygur
people for its extremely dry climate and lifeless shifting dunes,
is the second-largest in the world.
</P>
<P>
Researchers said that the purpose of growing vegetables in the
desert is to find a way of providing fresh vegetables for workers
drilling for oil in the desert.
</P>
<P>
Over the last two years researchers at the Lanzhou Desert
Institute and Xinjiang Biology and Soil Institute under the
Chinese Academy of Sciences have introduced 20 fine varieties of
plants to the desert and successfully grown 16 varieties of
vegetables and fruits.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about their "desert farm", researchers said that the
output of their spinach can reach as high as 30,000 kg per hectare
and that of celery can reach 75,000 kg per hectare.
</P>
<P>
"The yields of vegetables on desert land can be as high as on
normal farmland," one researcher said.
</P>
<P>
The researchers said that they carried out the experiments
under very bad natural conditions. The precipitation in the desert
is only between 30 mm and 50 mm, and the humidity in the summer
afternoon is almost zero. Researchers have to dig 10 meters deep
to reach underground water.
</P>
<P>
Scientists said that they have opened 2.2 hectares of proper
fields and built two greenhouses. They harvested 2,000 kg of
vegetables last year.

BAGHDAD, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Minister of Health Omed
Medhat Mubarak has disclosed that his Ministry's stores are
presently empty of medical drugs, particularly medicine for
emergency cases, on account of the continued embargo imposed
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In a statement printed in Iraqi weekly Alef Ba, the
Minister is quoted to have said that medical factories in Iraq do
not satisfy the country's needs except for few days.
</P>
<P>
He added that Iraq used to import some 500 million-dollar-worth
of medical drugs a year before the embargo, apart from the
Ministry's strategic stocks which stood at 1.25 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Iraqi citizens were also suffering from
malnutrition as ration cards satisfied less than half the calories
needed by the human body.
</P>
<P>
The supply ration card system was introduced in Iraq after the
embargo was imposed in 1990. The state is providing 90 million
dollars a month in subsidizing the rations.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou to Hold Investment Fair in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 12 (Xinhua) -- This capital city of south
China's Guangdong Province will open an investment fair in Hong
Kong April 22, a municipal official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Over 170 projects for investment will be offered at the fair,
during which new policies and measures concerning overseas
investment in the city will also be announced, said Luo Zhaosi,
deputy director of the Guangzhou Municipal Office for Overseas
Investment.
</P>
<P>
The largest among the investment projects will include the
city's second subway line, an inner ring road, airport
development, and some infrastructural and raw materials projects.
</P>
<P>
Luo said that written introductions to all the projects have
been delivered to potential investors, which include big companies
and consortia in Hong Kong and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that Guangzhou has utilized overseas
investment valued at 9.263 billion US dollars, 80 percent of which
is in the form of direct investment, since China launched its
reform and opening-up drive in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
The amount, from more than 30 countries and regions worldwide,
is the second-largest among all Chinese cities, exceeded only by
that of Shanghai, China's largest city.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou now has over 4,000 foreign-funded enterprises, the
industrial output value of which accounted for 38.9 percent of the
city's total last year. Exports by such enterprises made up 44
percent of Guangzhou's total in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Observers noted that Guangzhou has been shifting more of its
attention to big-name companies for overseas investment.

<HEADLINE> Trade Union Organizations Help Displaced Workers Find Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Since 1994 job placement
agencies run by trade union organizations in east China's Zhejiang
Province have found jobs for 22,000 unemployed workers, according
to an official of the provincial federation of trade unions.
</P>
<P>
For example, the Tian'an Job Placement Agency in the port city
of Ningbo has found jobs for 3,000 unemployed workers since its
establishment one year ago, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Since the second half of 1994 trade union organizations at
various levels have been trying to find new jobs for workers who
became unemployed as a result of enterprise restructuring, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
The organizations in the provincial capital of Hangzhou and the
cities of Ningbo and Wenzhou run technical training classes for
such workers.
</P>
<P>
Trade union organizations in Hangzhou's Xiacheng District have
opened a labor exchange market for displaced workers. After
training, 70 displaced workers in the district became refuse
collectors.
</P>
<P>
Last year at least 2,000 displaced workers in Ningbo found jobs
on the monthly "labor exchange day" organized jointly by the
Ningbo Federation of Trade Unions and the Municipal Labor Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The official said that trade union organizations throughout
Zhejiang have also set up 4,123 businesses hiring displaced
workers.
</P>
<P>
For instance, three companies set up by the Wenzhou City
Federation of Trade Unions have hired at least 1,000 displaced
workers.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Brother Industries Co., Ltd,
a Japanese transnational, has invested three billion yen (about 31
million US dollars) in China over the past four years.
</P>
<P>
Mikihiko Banno, managing director of Brother, said in an
exclusive interview with Xinhua that the company has established
four joint ventures in Zhuhai, Shenzhen, Xi'an and Shanghai,
respectively, and hired 1,000 local workers. These joint ventures
specialize in the production of electronic typewriters, label
printing machines, and household and industrial sewing machines.
</P>
<P>
Its joint venture in Shanghai, SMPIC Brother Industries Co., is
the largest foreign-funded electronic typewriter plant in China.
</P>
<P>
Banno said that China's demand for advanced textile and
electronic equipment is quickly rising, along with the country's
economic take-off. So far, Brother's production capacity in
China account for 10 percent of the whole company, and the sales
in China make up five percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
In China the manufacturing costs of Brother products are about
30 percent lower than in Japan, Banno noted, so the company will
enhance its wooing of the Chinese market and bring more advanced
technologies to China in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
Headquartered in Nagoya, the Brother Corp. has a registered
capital of 18.77 billion yen, and is the largest producer of
electronic printers and sewing machines in the world.

<HEADLINE> Slovakia Interested in Co-operating With China: Kovac </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Slovak President Michal
Kovac said here today that Slovakia is deeply interested in
promoting co-operation with China.
</P>
<P>
Kovac attended a China-Slovakia Economic and Trade Symposium
this morning and briefed the Chinese delegation on the present
economic situation of Slovakia, as well as its development
prospects.
</P>
<P>
The president expressed the conviction that both countries have
great interest in restoring their traditional economic and trade
relations and exploring new co-operative channels.
</P>
<P>
He said that Slovakia can join hands with China not only in
industrial sectors such as machinery and chemicals, but also in
farming and water conservancy.
</P>
<P>
Co-operation can be carried out through various forms such as
the establishment of joint ventures, mutual investment, technical
transfer or technical co-operation in third markets, the president
noted.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese customs statistics, trade between China
and Slovakia reached 68 million US dollars-worth in 1995, a great
development compared with the 24.07 million US dollars-worth of
1994.
</P>
<P>
However, Vice-President of the China Council for Promotion of
International Trade Liu Fugui pointed out that there still exist
problems in bilateral economic and trade ties.
</P>
<P>
A major one is the lack of direct trade channels and mutual
understanding between the two countries, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that through the symposium entrepreneurs
from both countries could get in touch with each other and deepen
their understanding so as to promote Sino-Slovak economic and
trade links.
</P>
<P>
A Slovak entrepreneurs delegation accompanying President Kovac
on his visit and more than 30 Chinese representatives from
different business lines took part in today's symposium.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Exports of Traditional Products Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' exports of
traditional products stood at 92.473 million US dollars in January
1996.
</P>
<P>
According to the Department of Trade and Industry, this is
24.14 percent down from 121.9 million dollars recorded a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Traditional products consisting of coconut, mineral, forest,
abaca, tobacco and petroleum products accounted for 6.51 percent
of the country's aggregate export receipts.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the Bureau of Export Trade Promotion
showed that for the month of January, coconut tops the list of
traditional products with export earnings valued at 48.898 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, coconut export earnings in January dropped 39.39
percent from last year's 80.594 million dollars due to the three
strong typhoons which hit the country in 1995.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji
said here today that there is great potential for the development
of Sino-Slovak trade.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with President of the Slovak Republic Michal
Kovac, Zhu said that the two-way trade should be carried out on
various levels, through different channels and in many ways.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral trade should also be developed on the basis of
equality and mutual benefit, and according to the principles of
the market economy, he added.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that the business circles of the two
countries would increase their contacts and understanding in order
to explore new ways of co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also expressed his conviction that Sino-Slovak trade ties
would enjoy stable development through the joint efforts of the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Kovac noted that every country in the world is facing historic
choices now, and taking every chance to develop itself.
</P>
<P>
Slovakia and China are both undergoing political and economic
reform, which will offer better circumstances for bilateral
economic co-operation and trade, he added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that pursuing sound ties with China is the
diplomatic focus of Slovakia in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the relations between the two countries have
enjoyed smooth development since Slovakia achieved
independence. He added that the Chinese government and people
greatly cherish the traditional friendship between the two
countries and peoples.
</P>
<P>
China attaches great importance to developing long-term and
stable friendship with Slovakia, he said, adding that China
respects the choice of the Slovak people, and Slovak domestic
and foreign policies.
</P>
<P>
Kovac arrived here Wednesday for a six-day official visit, at
the invitation of Chinese President Jiang Zemin.

<HEADLINE> China's Data Base Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- China's data base industry has
taken shape and developed into an independent trade with a
considerable scale.
</P>
<P>
A survey by the State Planning Commission (SPC), the State
Science and Technology Commission, and the State Information
Center has shown that the number of data bases in 64 ministries
and other parts of the State Council, or the Chinese cabinet, and
in many provinces is growing.
</P>
<P>
A data base can store accounting materials, reports, and
documents, reducing the amount of work of clerks, and can provide
information for its users with great speed and a lower rate of
errors.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, the number of data bases in China is
eight times the number in 1992, and the information mix is
improving. It is a promising hi-tech industry, with 1,083 public
and commercial data bases across the country, said an official
from the SPC.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of scientific and technological data handled has
decreased to 44 percent, while the amount of economic and social
information is as high as 56 percent, and the industry is becoming
more commercialized and wide-spread.
</P>
<P>
In addition to its major users in the State Council, data bases
are now accessible to more local users, accounting for 59 percent
of the country's total. But, according to the survey, the present
information mix should be improved, to that of developed nations.
</P>
<P>
Scientific and technical information, which makes up 44 percent
of the whole, occupies too big a share when compared with the
average of 20 percent in western countries. The storage of
economic information should be given more priority in data bases.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jinhua, the minister in charge of the SPC, said that,
after years of rapid development, China has had "a number of
remarkable achievements in the field of information technology."
</P>
<P>
According to a plan by the Ministry of Electronics Industry,
output value of the information industry will reach 100 billion to
120 billion yuan by the year 2000, and data bases will be one of
the biggest money makers in it.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also reveals that 1,000 to 1,500 information
service webs will come into existence in the next five years,
providing a base for the expanding data base industry.

<HEADLINE> India's Ruling Party Vows to Continue Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 12 (Xinhua) -- India's ruling Congress Party
today declared that there would be no reversal of liberalization
process and pledged to step up the momentum of economic reform to
achieve an 8 to 9 percent gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate
if voted to power.
</P>
<P>
The party's 40-page election manifesto, released here today by
party President P.V. Narasimha Rao, said the party would "carry
forward the momentum of economic reform and restructuring of
economic policies to achieve a higher trajectory of economic
growth, efficiency and competitiveness in all production sectors."
</P>
<P>
Harping on the main plank of economic reforms, initiated by the
Rao government in 1991, the party vowed that its government would
accord the highest priority to the restructuring of public sector
in order to make these enterprises "productive, efficient and
profitable."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the agriculture sector, the Congress Party
manifesto, which devotes major portion on economic issues, pledged
to continue the policy reforms, price incentives and input
subsidies which have improved the relative profitability of
agriculture and have enabled farmers to reach "new heights of
production and productivity."
</P>
<P>
On basic needs and human development front, the party promised
that its government would spend 6 percent of GDP on education and
intensify all related activities to promote education on a
"mission mode" to achieve universalization of elementary education
and foster excellence in higher education.
</P>
<P>
The party also promised "near-full employment" by the year 2002
by stepping up efforts through intensive implementation of special
employment programs.

<HEADLINE> Allegation on Chinese Nuclear Exports Refuted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The allegation that Chinese
companies have exported sensitive nuclear materials in large
quantities is an "utterly groundless slander," a spokesman of
Chinese Foreign Ministry said here today.
</P>
<P>
The statement came in response to a remark from foreign
reporters that China has transferred some technology from
Japanese, German and other European companies to other countries
and that certain Chinese companies have exported sensitive nuclear
materials.
</P>
<P>
"Recently, some people with ulterior motives have spread rumors
saying that China has transferred certain high-tech products to
other countries that it brought from Japan, Germany, and other
European countries, and accusing certain Chinese companies of
exporting sensitive nuclear materials. This is an utterly
groundless slander," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
It is well-known that the Chinese companies, when purchasing
dual-purpose high-tech products from foreign suppliers, have
always acted in accordance with international practices; that is,
the Chinese government will present the Importer Statement on
End-Users and Use to the supplier's government upon request, and
promise not to transfer the product to any third country, the
spokesman said, adding that the Chinese government has all along
strictly honored its commitment.
</P>
<P>
"The technologies and equipment imported by China under the
Importer Statement on End-users and Use are subject to the strict
control and supervision of the Chinese government. No Chinese
company has ever violated its commitment," the spokesman
emphasized.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Gain More Revenues from Mining Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The projected boom in the
Philippine mining industry is expected to generate some 500
million US dollars in government revenues until 2010, according to
a study made by the Asian Development Bank (ADB).
</P>
<P>
The ADB study said that the country's mineral sector would be a
major contributor to the government's fiscal outlook in the next
few years.
</P>
<P>
At present, about 60 local and foreign mining firms have
pending applications for financial and technical assistance
agreement (FTAA) with the Board of Investments (BOI), of which
only three have been approved yet.
</P>
<P>
The projected influx of foreign miners has been causing alarm
among local miners, the ABD study said, adding that this would
create a havoc in their stature.
</P>
<P>
However, the ADB study noted, "This in fact will benefit the
local miners as they can immediately benefit from the reduction in
excise tax from 5 percent to 1.5 percent over the next three years
and to two percent in the following three years."

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Holds Economic Conference on Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 12 (Xinhua) -- A large-sized economic
conference was held here today with a focus on promoting Hong Kong
as an international financial and trading center, a shipping and
civil aviation center and a communications center.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Zhou Nan, director of Xinhua News Agency
Hong Kong Branch, said that Hong Kong is facing an unprecedented
development opportunity in the latter part of its transitional
period.
</P>
<P>
Zhou listed four factors that have significant influences on
Hong Kong's future development direction -- the "China factor",
the principle of "one country, two systems", the realization of
"Hong Kong people running Hong Kong" and efforts to maintain
stability.
</P>
<P>
Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of
the State Council, delivered a luncheon speech on Hong Kong
residents' nationality and right of abode.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong residents of Chinese descent can keep
their permanent residence status without sacrificing their foreign
travel documents after 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said that according to the proposal of the Preparatory
Committee for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR),
"returned" emigrants" of Chinese origin, who have emigrated
overseas and obtained foreign passports, are Chinese nationals
unless they declare a change of nationality.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, they can retain their right of abode in
Hong Kong whenever they come back, either before or after 1997.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xuebing, chairman and president of the Bank of China, said
that with 1997 approaching, the Hong Kong banking industry is
facing unparalleled historic opportunities.
</P>
<P>
He said Hong Kong can only maintain its position as an
international financial center through attracting various
international and local financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
He said the Bank of China will spare no effort in working with
the Hong Kong monetary authority to maintain the stability of the
Hong Kong monetary system.
</P>
<P>
Hiroshi Zaizen, senior managing director of Mitsubishi
Corporation, said that in addition to its current function as a
financial, trade and service center, Hong Kong is developing
information communications networks and is expected to establish
itself as a hub of airport of the Asia Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen speakers including senior Chinese officials, Chinese
and Hong Kong bankers, and overseas entrepreneurs delivered
speeches at the conference entitled "Towards 1997 and Beyond --
Hong Kong Economic Development Conference".
</P>
<P>
The one-day conference, organized by the Better Hong Kong
Foundation and the Hong Kong Development Council, attracted over
1,000 business leaders.

DAR ES SALAAM, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa has stressed the importance of women's education
to the development of mankind.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating an additional working space for the Open
University of Tanzania, President Mkapa said here on Thursday,
that although women constituted more than half the country's
population, they lagged behind men in education.
</P>
<P>
He cited a study carried out between 1990 and 1994 on
university enrolement which showed that the female average ratio
was only 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa appealed to women in position of furthering their
education to take advantage of the Open University and the fund
to acquire further studies and challenged men to support their
wives in this direction.
</P>
<P>
"For many women, distant education is their only hope for a
higher education, and as such we must make extra efforts to
ensure women avail themselves of this alternative path," Mkapa
said.

<P>
NEW DELHI, April 12 (Xinhua) -- India's ruling Congress party
(Congress-Indira) today vowed to wage an all out war against
corruption and promised stability, progress and national unity if
voted to power.
</P>
<P>
The party's 40-page election manifesto, released here by party
president P.V. Narasimha Rao, pledged to establish Lok Pal
(people's supervision commission) with jurisdiction over all
political offices including that of the prime minister and the
chief ministers in a bid to control and contain corruption.
</P>
<P>
The release of the manifesto was delayed by over an hour than
expected with reporters making a scramble for limited copies of
the document made available shortly before the arrival of
Narasimha Rao, the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
None of the Hawala-tainted ministers were present on the
occasion. The Hawala case is a 18-million-US-dollar bribery
scandal involving dozens of the country's leading politicians.
</P>
<P>
The manifesto said the Congress-Indira is committed to
providing an effective government for a stable polity, to
preserving and promoting unity and integrity of India in which
every section of the country can live in harmony and in pursuit of
happiness.
</P>
<P>
"The Congress theme for this election is stability, national
security, harmony and development", it said.
</P>
<P>
The document said the Congress-Indira government had fulfilled
almost all the promises made in the manifesto of 1991.
</P>
<P>
Spelling out its vision for the next five years, the party
promised houses for the houseless poor, jobs for jobless so as to
provide near full employment by the year 2002.

<HEADLINE> 120,000 Red Army Veterans Still Alive in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 120,000 veterans of
China's Red Army are still living in various villages, townships,
and cities around China, according to the Ministry of Civil
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
These include retired soldiers and those who were separated
from the main unit during the famous Long March (1934-35).
</P>
<P>
The Red Army, now called the People's Liberation Army, was
under the leadership of the late Chairman Mao Zedong and the
Chinese Communist Party in the 1920s and 1930s, and made a great
contribution to the Chinese revolution.
</P>
<P>
For the past six decades, and the last ten years in particular,
the Party and the army have taken good care of these veterans,
giving them preferential treatment in many ways. They are well
respected wherever they live. They are also provided with certain
annual subsidies.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, a park honoring the Long March of the Red Army will
soon be completed, providing the public with a view of the
difficulties of that long trek.

<HEADLINE> Caltex Drops Sale Of Shares In Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The American Caltex Petroleum
Corporation has withdrawn sale of shares and assets of its
subsidiary company in Uganda, the local daily "the New Vision"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Dana Flanders, a Caltex representative in East Africa and
Indian Ocean region, was quoted as saying that the company had
decided to revitalize its Ugandan subsidiary by investing about
10 million US Dollars over the next three to five years in retail
and commercial marketing facilities.
</P>
<P>
In 1994 the company announced that it was negotiating with a
Tanzanian company with headquarters in Mauritius, the Gulf Africa
Petroleum Company (GAPC), for the sale of its assets and shares in
Uganda, Tanzania and Malawi.
</P>
<P>
The shares in Tanzania and Malawi were bought by the GAPC, but
the company was reportedly unable to complete its negotiations on
shares in Uganda and the negotiations were terminated in November
last year.
</P>
<P>
Caltex has supplied oil products in East Africa since the
1920s and has operated in Uganda since 1961.
</P>
<P>
Flanders added, "We are the third largest oil company serving
Uganda."

<HEADLINE> Tourism Turns Booming Sector in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Mythical Tibetan Buddhism and
exotic folk customs have helped create a multi-million dollar
tourism industry in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Now the flow of overseas and domestic tourists has become a
vital business which has increased Tibet's income and spurred the
growth of many other economic sectors, local officials said.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the Tibet Autonomous Region welcomed more than 30,000
overseas tourists, and earned 11.3 million US dollars in foreign
exchange which rose by 8.1 percent over the figure of the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
The plateau region also received 20,000 domestic tourists last
year.
</P>
<P>
Highland scenery, abundant cultural relics, mythical Tibetan
Buddhism and exotic folk customs have become appealing tourist
attractions for people both from home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, regional tourism departments have made
efforts to expand tourism by opening new tourist sites and
improving facilities at existing spots.
</P>
<P>
Two vocational areas, the Conggo Lake about 300 km east of the
region's capital city of Lhasa, and Xungbalaqu on the outskirts of
Lhasa, were brought into use last year.
</P>
<P>
Two major circular tourist routes to the east and west of Lhasa
City have created a string of tourism spots in Nyingchi, Shannan
and Ngari prefectures.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995 there were 108 businesses linked to the
tourism industry, including 42 tourism agencies. Across the region
38 hotels, with 2,570 rooms, were granted rights to receive
overseas tourists. Some 3,200 people now work in tourism
businesses, 62 percent of them Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
In addition to tourists from Germany, the United States, France
and Britain, more are coming from Japan, the Republic of Korea,
Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Booming tourism has spurred allied industries in Tibet, such as
civil aviation, transportation, posts and telecommunications,
commerce, as well as ticket revenue at tourism spots.
</P>
<P>
Many local residents have also benefitted a great deal from
tourism.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 12 (Xinhua) -- China's largest economic center
plans to have 38 billion US dollars' worth of exports and imports
in the year of 2000.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed at a foreign trade meeting today by the
city's vice-mayor, Jiang Yiren, who said that the value of imports
and exports is expected to reach 12.5 billion US dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
The traditional markets - Japan, Hong Kong, Macao, the United
States, and the European Union - will account for 65 percent of
the city's export markets during the next five-year period, down
from the current 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
Some newly-emerging markets in Southeast Asia, the Middle East,
southern Africa, Latin America, the Commonwealth of Independent
States, and Oceania will have a 35 percent share of Shanghai's
total exports, a rise from present 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the exports will come to 20 billion US dollars, and
imports, 18 billion in 2000.
</P>
<P>
In the next five years, the annual growth rate for exports is
set at 14 percent, and that of imports, 20 percent, he added.

<HEADLINE> Switzerland's UBS Says No to Rival Bank's Merger Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS)
has decided to reject the idea of a merger with its rival Credit
Suisse that would have created the world's largest bank outside
Japan, local press reported.
</P>
<P>
The decision, which was made unanimously by the UBS board in an
emergency meeting Thursday evening, came two days after the news
broke that Switzerland's second-largest bank, Credit Suisse, had
approached top-ranked UBS about a possible link.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Credit Suisse would now almost certainly have to
abandon the idea to create a banking giant with more than 600
billion U.S. dollars of total assets and a combined market value
of about 45 billion.
</P>
<P>
For many experts, UBS's decision was not beyond their
expectations. They had noted that the merger proposal would face
strong opposition in Switzerland on competition grounds and the
two banks have had very different banking cultures with Credit
Suisse known as a risk-taker and UBS an ultraconservative.
</P>
<P>
Politicians have also been upset about the potential loss of as
many as 15,000 jobs as a result of the merger.
</P>
<P>
However, the failed merger plan had shed light on the
overbanked Swiss market, where banking profits have long lagged
behind levels in the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
It also underscored the need for further reform in other
European markets which suffer from a similar excess of banks and a
lack of competition, news reports commented.

<HEADLINE> hke041233--Roundup: Poll Preparation in Full Swing in Bangladesh (by Jiang Xianming) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The political arena is getting
lively in Bangladesh as preparations for the next parliamentary
elections are in full swing.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, the 11-member caretaker government led by Chief
Adviser Mohammad Habibur Rahman formally took oath following the
dissolution of the 12-day sixth parliament and the resignation of
Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia on March 30.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said the swearing-in paved the way for the next
general polls, a task of primary importance for the whole nation.
</P>
<P>
The electioneering has started even before the voting date is
announced, the local press said, adding that people are anxiously
waiting to exercise their rights to franchise in the coming polls.
</P>
<P>
Former Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) A.K.M. Sadeque had to
tender his resignation last Saturday after the opposition charged
him with having helped to rig the February 15 polls won by the
former ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) but boycotted by
the opposition.
</P>
<P>
President Abdur Rahman Biswas, on the advice of the caretaker
government, appointed former secretary and member of the Planning
Commission Abu Hena as the new CEC, who was sworn in Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, the six election commissioners
will be appointed from six divisions of the highest level of the
local administrative body.
</P>
<P>
Moving ahead with its main task of preparing for the elections,
the caretaker government has taken several steps to reorganize the
civil and police administration to ensure free and fair polls.
</P>
<P>
A committee led by two advisers to the caretaker government has
been set up to look into the postings and transfers of field level
officers who will work as returning and assistant returning
officers during the coming elections.
</P>
<P>
A six-member committee headed by Adviser Dr. Mohammad Younus is
currently working to seek the best way to maintain law and order
in the country through the deployment of the existing
law-enforcing agencies in the elections.
</P>
<P>
It will also examine whether the previous BNP government had
politicized the administration and bring about necessary changes
in different tiers of the administration to free it from party
influence as far as possible.
</P>
<P>
A reshuffle is also expected in the Police Department.
</P>
<P>
In action, heat and sound of the campaign are already palpable
as leaders of the major political parties have virtually kicked
off their efforts to woo the voters with all eyes cast on the
elections.
</P>
<P>
The two arch rival parties, the BNP and the Awami (People's)
League (AL), have launched their respective campaign from the
country's largest port city of Chittagong.
</P>
<P>
AL President Sheikh Hasina addressed her first public meeting
there last Friday after the establishment of the caretaker
government while BNP Chairperson and ex-Prime Minister Khaleda did
the same Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The BNP has reportedly decided to launch a poll campaign
similar to that of 1991, targeting the AL as the main opponent
with an emphasis on anti-India issues by describing the AL as a
pro-Indian political platform to safeguard India's interest in
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The BNP is also urging the nationalist forces to unite and
taking initiatives to bring its allies into an electoral alliance.
</P>
<P>
The AL, the Jatiya (National) Party (JP) and the
Jamaat-e-Islami, which jointly led the anti-BNP campaign for the
last two years, have kept their liaison committee in place
although it is a loose alliance.
</P>
<P>
The opposition campaigns against the BNP appear to center on
corruption charges against BNP ministers and leaders, high prices
of daily necessities and misuse of bureaucracy and power.
</P>
<P>
The JP is now seeking for the release of JP Chairman H.M.
Ershad, imprisoned on charges of corruption and illegal possession
of arms and money.
</P>
<P>
The new CEC initiated separate talks Thursday with several
party leaders on various issues relating to the upcoming polls.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the parties assured the CEC of their all-out
support to ensure free and fair elections.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission (EC) has agreed to update the voters'
list in the next 10 days on requests of the political parties.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the election schedule is likely to be announced
after the 10-day period.
</P>
<P>
According to Bangladesh's constitution, the general elections
must be held within 90 days after the dissolution of the last
parliament.
</P>
<P>
As the sixth parliament was dissolved on March 30, the next
general elections must be held by June 28.
</P>
<P>
Senior election officials disclosed that the caretaker
government has decided to hold the polls in mid-June, tentatively
on June 17.
</P>
<P>
Addressing EC officials after taking the oath, CEC Hena asked
all of the officials to treat the coming polls as a challenge and
with sincere and dedicated service.
</P>
<P>
A free and fair election is the expectation of the nation and
all should work closely and with the most sincerity to fulfill it,
he stressed.

<HEADLINE> UK Labour Wins Smashing Victory in By-Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 12 (Xinhua) -- British opposition Labour has won
the by-election in the Staffordshire South-West constituency with
a 22 percent swing, leaving the Conservative government only
one-seat majority in the House of Commons, according to press
reports here today.
</P>
<P>
The by-election was held after the death of Conservative
member of parliament Sir David Lightbown last December. He
had a majority of 7,192 over Labour in the 1992 general
election.
</P>
<P>
The by-election was held on Thursday and it was announced
early today that Labour overturned the Conservative majority
with a lead of 13,762.
</P>
<P>
There were 13 political parties contest the election. Labour's
candidate Brian Jenkins polled 26,155 votes, with the
Conservative candidate Jimmy James polling 12,393. And the
Liberal Democrats with 2,042 votes.
</P>
<P>
The victory is considered very crucial for Labour's
leader Tony Blair, who attempts to portray his "New Labour"
as a moderate alternative after 17 years of conservative
rule.
</P>
<P>
Blair, who is visiting the United States, said that this
victory showed the Britons no longer trust the Tories but the New
Labour.
</P>
<P>
And this could not be dismissed as a protest vote. It was
a rejection of the Tories and their betrayal of the British
people, he added.
</P>
<P>
For the Conservatives, there is a danger that one more death or
defection will leave the Tory party in a minority position. Prime
Minister John Major might be forced to call for an early general
election which is scheduled for May, 1997.
</P>
<P>
This is the 35th successive defeat in by-election for the
Conservatives since their last by-election victory in
February, 1989.
</P>
<P>
The Tory party won a surprise victory in the 1992 general
election with a 21-seat majority in the 651-seat House of
Commons.
</P>
<P>
Since then, deaths, two unexpected defections and
by-elections defeats have gradually whittled that figure
down.
</P>
<P>
Insurance mortality charts indicate that four more MPs
could die by the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> 30 Kilograms Pure Heroin Seized in Eastern Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Turkish narcotics police seized
30 kilograms of pure heroin and detained three suspected
smugglers in Van province, eastern Turkey, the semi-official
Anatolia News Agency reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the Turkish police stopped a car on the
Van-Ercis highway and found the 30 kilograms of pure heroin in 60
parcels hidden in the car, which was transferred from Iran.
</P>
<P>
Three people, who suspectedly smuggled the heroin, have been
arrested, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
The agency said Thursday that the Turkish police had
confiscated over 26 kilograms of heroin on the E-80 highway in
Bolu, about 200 kilometers from northwest of Ankara. The heroin
also came from Iran bound for Istanbul, it said.
</P>
<P>
Anatolia reported in the same day that the Turkish police
seized 80 kilograms of heroin, 11 kilograms of hashish and five
grams of cocaine in three operations against drugs trafficking in
Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Turkish police confiscated three tons and 456
kilograms of heroin, 17 tons and 356 kilograms of hashish, 939
kilograms of base morphine, 121 kilograms of opium, 75 kilograms
of cocaine, 53 tons and 287 kilograms of anhydride acid,

<HEADLINE> China Villages Suffer from Ground Caving In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of buildings in two
Chinese villages have been damaged by a massive cave-in in the
ground.
</P>
<P>
A total of 50 buildings, as well as some rice fields, in two
adjacent villages in Ji'an County, east China's Jiangxi Province,
suffered in the land collapse.
</P>
<P>
When the cave-in occurred, water in wells, fields and rivers
drained away from underneath, fortunately, no casualties were
reported.
</P>
<P>
Families have had to be evacuated while experts were sent in to
investigate the cause of the disaster.
</P>
<P>
The first signs of the disaster appeared in February when
villagers in Shajiang Village of An'tang Township found cracks on
the walls of their homes.
</P>
<P>
By March 15, the foundations of seven buildings had sunk or
were badly leaning.
</P>
<P>
By the end of March, 43 buildings in the village, with a ground
space of 4,500 sq m, had cracks on walls due to caving-in of the
ground in the village.
</P>
<P>
Five buildings in the adjacent Shitang Village, Gongtian
Township, also had cracked walls, with a crack up to 125 cm wide.
</P>
<P>
Rice fields in the two villages, also caved in, with the
biggest of a series of holes measuring four meters in diameter and
over six meters in depth.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the disaster, an investigation team was sent to the
disaster-stricken areas by the provincial government, to find out
the cause of the disaster, and offer effective measures to help
the local people.
</P>
<P>
The team, comprised of experts, believe that the sinking
of the ground in the two villages was the result of karst cave-ins.
</P>
<P>
Since last autumn, a lingering drought dropped groundwater
level considerably, emptying the insides of underground caves.
</P>
<P>
The sub-soil conditions brought about by drought combined with
the soaking by spring rain, which softens soil, resulted in the
caving in of the land.
</P>
<P>
Stratigraphic structures in neighboring counties are similar,
and since 1990 caving-ins have occurred successively in
the counties of Yongfeng, Suichuan and Yongxin.
</P>
<P>
Villagers in the disaster-stricken areas have been evacuated
elsewhere for the time being, while rescue efforts are being made
by the local government, in an attempt to help the villagers
rebuild their homes.

NANNING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region in south China has used 21 million US dollars in funds to
build a 6,522-km-long optical fiber cable network, the fifth
longest in China in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
Foreign funds used in the past five years accounted for 30
percent of the investment on the network.
</P>
<P>
Many parts and equipment were imported from Nokia of Finland,
the US's AT&AMP;T, and NEC of Japan. Nearly 80 percent of the spare
parts for a quasi-synchronous cable, which went operational
recently, were imported.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi welcomes overseas companies to invest in its
telecommunications industry, especially in a high-speed
large-capacity optical cable project to further improve its
telecommunications, said Ou Changxian, director of the regional

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Give HIV Tests to Students in Drug Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Blood tests will be given to
detect HIV carriers among Malaysian students who are confirmed to
be drug addicts, Deputy Education Minister Fong Chan Onn said
today, the Bernama news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said it would be unnecessary to give blood tests to all
students as the Health Ministry has established that the main
cause of AIDS infection is drug addiction.
</P>
<P>
"After we learnt about the cause of the infection, we decided
that blood tests should be confined to students who are confirmed
to be drug addicts through urine tests," Fong told the press in
Kota Baharu, Kelantan.
</P>
<P>
Some social groups in Malaysia have called for blood tests for
all students after the Health Ministry revealed that 13 students
were confirmed to have contracted the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
Fong said school principals have been empowered to order
students whom they suspect to be drug addicts to undergo urine
tests with the cooperation of the state Education Department.
</P>
<P>
"Only if they are confirmed to be drug addicts will they have
to undergo blood tests for HIV," he added.
</P>
<P>
Fong said students infected with the AIDS virus would be
allowed to continue their education but their progress would be
monitored by teachers and school authorities based on the
guideline issued by the Health Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Bernama quoted Fong as saying the identity of the students
would be kept confidential and teachers would be directed to
handle such students in an appropriate way and ensure that other
students are not exposed to any risk of getting the disease.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Lebanese-Syrian Summit in 48 Hours (by Shao Jie) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi
and his Syrian counterpart Hafez Assad are expected to hold a
meeting in Damascus in 48 hours, a well-informed official source
announced this morning.
</P>
<P>
The credible source said that Lebanese House Speaker Nabih
Berri and Prime Minister Rafik Al Hariri would take part in the
summit, in the presence of their Syrian counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Hariri cancelled a private visit to
Saudi Arabia, which had been scheduled on today, the anonymous
source noted. And he quoted the house speaker as saying that the
Lebanese-Syrian summit could very probably be held on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese President Hrawi, in few hours during the daytime
Thursday when Israeli warplanes were bombarding Beirut's south
suburbs and other parts of the country, made "more than one
telephone call" with Syrian President Assad.
</P>
<P>
And Hrawi also held a contact at the same time with Syrian Vice
President Abdel Halim Khaddam.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Lebanese government is studying a move to lodge
a complaint with the U.N. Security Council, against the Israeli
aggressions Thursday, which continued from the first hour in the
morning until later in the afternoon, and led to the killing of
five persons, including a Lebanese army sergeant, and the wounding
of 15 others.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Foreign Minister Fares Boueiz announced last night
that "contacts are continuing and we are seriously studying the
move of filing a complaint with the U.N. Security Council against
the Israeli aggressions."
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Mohsen Dalloul, after a meeting with the
prime minister, disclosed that diplomatic contacts were under way
in order to avoid a further escalation of the tension in South
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said this morning that Lebanese Ambassador
to Washington Riad Tabbara had held a meeting with U.S. Assistant
Secretary for Middle East Affairs Robert Pelletreau.
</P>
<P>
In a report to his government, Tabbara noted that he was told
by Pelletreau that Washington would use the right of "veto" if
Lebanon lodges a complaint with the U.N. Security Council, in
which the United States is one of the five permanent members.
</P>
<P>
Reporting from Washington, a correspondent of the Beirut
largest-circulated daily An-Nahar quoted a U.S. department
official as saying that the meeting between Pelletreau and
Tabbara was "for a frank exchange of views."
</P>
<P>
The American side told the lebanese Ambassador that the
time was not now "for the Security Council and for our
efforts to solve the problem on the ground," the An-Nahar
correspondent quoted the anonymous U.S. official as stressing.
</P>
<P>
However, a Lebanese senior official noted that his government
was not surprised by the air strike carried out by Israel
Thursday, for the Jewish state had announced since a period that
it would launch an air raid rather than a ground action against
the pro-Iranian militant Hezbollah in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Al Hariri stressed last night
that the only way to get out of the current situation and the only
way to cast off the "vicious circle," which has continuously
existed for years, is an implementation of U.N. Security Council
resolutions, especially an implementation of the Security Council
resolution 425, which calls for an unconditional Israeli
withdrawal from South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the resistance is a result of the Israeli
occupation, and "a continuity of the occupation gives an excuse
to all the operations carried out on the Lebanese lands."
</P>
<P>
Hariri underlined that after a termination of the Israeli
occupation, "there will not be a justification for the Hezbollah
to remain armed, and there will not be other arms but the arms of
the Lebanese army and the Lebanese security forces," reiterating
that the Lebanese authorities will be responsible for the security
in the south after the Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Defense Minister Dalloul, on the other hand, accused
Israel of violating a U.S.-mediated understanding, which put an
end to an Israeli blitz in south Lebanon in July, 1993, and under
which Israel promised to refrain from attacking Lebanese civilian
targets in exchange for Hezbollah's guarantee for a security of
northern Israeli settlements.
</P>
<P>
Dalloul attributed an escalation in South Lebanon in the past
few days to the repeated killings of civilians and children in the
south, stressing, "It is Israel which violated the July
understanding, and which committed the massacres against our
people, and it is natural for us to fire back."
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah's Secretary General Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah vowed
that his party would respond to the aggressions taking place
Thursday, noting that the possible targets for a responding
action would not be limited to the Jewish settlements in northern
Israel.

URUMQI, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese city of Urumqi has
experienced its biggest snowstorm for almost fifty years.
</P>
<P>
The two day April snowstorm swept the capital city of northwest
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region on Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The roofs of buildings, electricity lines, and trees were all
covered with snows as thick as a quilt with cotton wadding.
</P>

Cars and trucks moved slowly, bus stations were crowded with
people, and taxis had a brisk business. Police and electricity
workers were called in to provide emergency services.
</P>
<P>
Along the 312 highway, 20 km away from the downtown, more than
400 traffic policemen took to the road, directing traffic, pushing
away road barriers, and sweeping snow off the road.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Some people predict that China
will become one of the world's largest markets for infrastructure
projects in the next five to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 662 cities contain nearly one-third of
China's 1.21 billion people in their urban areas, and 32 cities
have an urban population of more than 1 million each, "China
Securities" reported today.
</P>
<P>
In the next five years, about 200 million rural people are
expected to become urban dwellers in a period of mushrooming
growth in new cities.
</P>
<P>
China is expected to double its investment in urban engineering
projects, pouring 500 or 600 billion yuan into this sector during
the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
According to a new plan of the Ministry of Construction, the
added value generated by the real estate business will grow at an
annual rate of 18 percent in the next five years. The ratio of
added value of properties will account for 3.5 percent of the
country's GDP by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Rapid expansion of that business had created job opportunities
for 857,600 people by the end of 1995. The figure is expected to
climb to 1 million by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Warplanes Launch Air Raid at South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes carried out at
10:45 am (7:45 GMT) an air raid at a hill southwest of the
southern Lebanese market town of Nabatiyeh, security sources
reported.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that two air-to-surface missile fell in the
Nabatiyeh town without causing casualties.
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah or Party of God
launched at 9:50 (6:50 GMT) 15 Katyusha rockets into northern
Israel, wounding nine Israelis in the Jewish settlement of Kyriat
Shmona, security sources in South lebanon reported.
</P>
<P>
And only an hour and half later, the Shiite militant Hezbollah
announced that they launched a second Katyusha attack at the
Jewish settlement of Limttali in northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah guerrillas also fired Katyusha rockets this morning
at Marjayoun, the biggest city in the Israeli-occupied border
strip in South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
This was the second time for the militant Hezbollah to launch
Katyusha attacks at northern Israel in 24 hours. And the Hezbollah
said that today's attack was for a revenge for Israeli aggressions
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Army xonfirmed that some ten Katyusha rockets hit the
Jewish settlement of Kyriat Shmona in northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the first katyusha rocket attack, Radio of the
Israeli client militia threatened that the Israeli forces would
bombard the southern Lebanese villages where the Hezbollah fired
the Katyusha rockets.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah guerrillas fired on Thursday afternoon Katyusha
rockets into the Galilee panhandle in northern Israel, in a
retaliation for a series of air raids Israeli warplanes carried
out at Beirut's south suburbs and other areas in this country
Thursday, in which five people were killed and 15 others were
wounded.
</P>
<P>
In an anticipation for the attack by Lebanese Moslem
guerrillas, local residents in the Jewish settlements in northern
Israel had been asked by the Israel army to resort to bomb
shelters.
</P>
<P>
And Israeli occupation forces, since last night, bombarded a
number of suspected guerrilla targets in South Lebanon and
Western Bekaa, and the bombardments are sporadicly continuing
when this story is dispatched.

in the morning bombardments.

<P>
HONG KONG, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese government officials
and senior Hong Kong officials held their 10th informal
get-together here today.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing after the meeting, Zheng Guoxiong, deputy
director of Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch, said, "Like the
previous nine informal get-togethers, today's informal meeting
with the officials from the Independent Commission Against
Corruption (ICAC) is again a success."
</P>
<P>
Zheng said that the ICAC is an important law enacting
department. The Basic Law clearly stipulates that a Commission
Against Corruption shall be established in the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) and it shall function independently
and be accountable to the Chief Executive.
</P>
<P>
According to the Basic Law, as one of the principal officials,
the Commissioner Against Corruption of the Hong Kong SAR shall be
nominated by the Chief Executive and be reported to the Central
Government for appointment.
</P>
<P>
That is the legal guarantee for the Commission Against
Corruption to fulfill its commitment of preventing and fighting
embezzlement and maintaining clean government, Zheng said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that the ICAC will keep a stable rank
and be devoted to their duties, adding that the ICAC is expected
to make due contributions to the smooth handover of political
power and the smooth transition in Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Guizhou's Cooperation Opportunities for Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, April 12 (Xinhua) -- China's policy of speeding up
economic growth in western parts of the country offers many
opportunities for Hong Kong business people to invest in the energy
giant, Guizhou Province.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came from Lou Jiwei, newly-appointed vice governor
of Guizhou at a discussion with Hong Kong industrialists held
Thursday in Guiyang, the provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
Although Guizhou, in southwest China, is landlocked, it has
plentiful mineral and energy resources, a huge coal reserve, water
resources, and China's largest aluminum plant.
</P>
<P>
Guizhou will try to take advantage of Hong Kong as a leading
financial center in the Asia-Pacific region to enter the
international financial market by issuing bonds and stocks,
Lou said.
</P>
<P>
He said he expects Hong Kong firms to provide his province with
advanced technology, equipment, and information to develop
textiles, electric, foodstuff processing, and the pharmaceutical
industry.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is the largest importer of goods from Guizhou, whose
export value reached 420 million US dollars last year. The
province has 1,000 foreign-funded enterprises, 60 percent of which
involve Hong Kong and Macao investment.
</P>
<P>
To improve its investment environment, the province will
allocate 3 billion yuan for building a 1,300-km expressway
network, which will lead to ports on the Beibu Gulf in neighboring
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Longdongbao Airport in Guiyang,
believed to be the largest in southwest China, is expected to be
open to traffic on July 1, 1997. At present, several railway
projects are going on in Guizhou, as part of the State's efforts
to improve the infrastructure in western parts of the country.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Paper Comments on Jordan's Dramatic Policy Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 12 (Xinhua) -- "Jordan's acceptance today of
a squadron of 30 U.S. Air Force fighter aircraft to patrol
southern Iraq completes a dramatic shift in its regional
orientation," said a commentary published in the English-language
daily, The Jerusalem Post, today.
</P>
<P>
"During the 1991 Gulf War, Jordan did not back the
American-led coalition's war effort largely out of domestic
considerations. In previous years the Jordanians had been a
strategic partner of Iraq. Now, by joining the American effort to
contain Saddam Hussein, Jordan has suddenly emerged as a critical
strategic asset for the U.S. in the defense of the Persian Gulf,"
said the author, Dore Gold, who is the director of the
U.S. Foreign and Defense Policy Project -- Jaffee Center for
Strategic Studies, Tel Aviv University.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the commentary said that "neither of the U.S.'s
other non-Gulf Arab partners -- Egypt and Syria -- have been able
to carve out for themselves an equivalent role in the protection
of Western oil interests."
</P>
<P>
The commentary said: "Until recently, American air patrols over
 the Southern No-Fly Zone in southern Iraq took off from American
air bases in the Arabian peninsula or from U.S. Navy carriers. The
global requirements of American carrier power in the western
Pacific near Taiwan Straits and in the Mediterranean created a gap
for the Gulf region. The Jordanian deployment of U.S. land-based
aircraft is intended to fill this gap."
</P>
<P>
"The American deployment has significant implications for the
Middle East," said the commentary. "It sends a message to
Jordan's potential adversaries in the region -- from Yasser
Arafat to Saddam Hussein -- that the kingdom is a vital American
national interest."
</P>
<P>
The commentary concludes: "This message is no less important
for Syria to hear. The Jordanian role in Gulf security should help
heal the rift between the Hashemite Kingdom and Saudi Arabia, as
well as that with Kuwait." "Finally, it confirms that Jordan's
decision to give asylum to defecting Iraqi officers was not
cosmetic, but a real strategic shift away from Saddam Hussein and
to a new military partnership with the U.S.," it added.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Says Border Wall with Thailand Benefits All </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said today his country meant no unfriendliness
towards Thailand by the construction of a border wall between the
two countries, the Bernama news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Opening a border administration complex in Padang Besar
bordering Thailand, Mahathir said the construction of the
27-kilometer wall was aimed at facilitating administrative matters
along the border, such as checking smuggling activities.
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier Bernama report, Malaysia is building
the border wall near Padang Besar along its border with Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Foreign Ministry said there was no valid reason for
the construction of the wall, arguing that it showed the country
building it did not want to be friendly with its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Thailand even said the International Court of Justice in the
Hague will be asked to rule on Malaysia's construction of the wall
if the two sides fail to reach any agreement.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the wall was being built on Malaysian soil, not
on the border, which reflects Malaysia's respect for its
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"With the existence of the wall, all administrative matters can
be attended to in a better and more orderly manner," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir added that the move would benefit not only Malaysia
but also Thailand in terms of border security.

<HEADLINE> China Developing Cut-Price Space Vehicle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese space experts are working
on a cut-price space vehicle of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
They say that US and former USSR stations are far too costly
to maintain in orbit.
</P>
<P>
And some media reports indicate that China is already training
astronauts to send them into orbit in the next generation of
spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
Officials confirm that China has made headway in major
technology during their studies of the concepts of space vehicle
technology.
</P>
<P>
The experts say China's space program is very much closer to
Europe's, and that future space vehicles will be much smaller, and
less expensive to maintain, after being launched into orbit than
existing stations.
</P>
<P>
Wang Tongyi, vice-minister of the Commission of Science,
Technology and Industry for National Defense, said about 5,600
scientists were working nationwide on space research, in 400 areas
of space and laser know-how.
</P>
<P>
Their work involves space science and its application, large
carrier rockets, space stations, and space-to-earth transportation
systems.
</P>
<P>
He said by researching the concepts of the future development
of space technology, the study by the Chinese scientists has
provided support for the country's decision-making concerning its
future space development.
</P>
<P>
Space and laser technologies are an important part of the
country's hi-tech research and development program, known as the
863 Program.
</P>
<P>
The 1.2 billion US dollar program - spanning 15 years - which
was launched in 1986, also includes five research fields of
automation, information, bio-technology, new materials and energy.
</P>
<P>
China's top space scientist Fan Jianfeng, described the space
station program being developed by the United States for launch in
2010, as "very big, comprehensive, complicated and very
expensive."
</P>
<P>
China, because of its own national economic conditions, should
not develop such a costly space station, said Fan.
</P>
<P>
Fan, who began space technology research three decades ago,
said the Salut and MIR space stations launched by the former
Soviet Union are also very expensive.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the two stations required costly supplies of
materials once every two months while orbiting earth.
</P>
<P>
The proposal Fan and his colleagues have put forward is to
develop the key technology of a new space vehicle that requires
being looked after for a short period of time by astronauts, but
for most of the time can be operated from earth stations through
remote control.
</P>
<P>
The proposed vehicle will greatly reduce the amount of money
needed to maintain the operation of the station in space.
</P>
<P>
"During the past three or four years, the international space
station development programs have tended to scale down, especially
the European space station program, which is very close to ours,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Vice-minister Wang said Chinese scientists have conducted
research for "short-period environment control and life
protection".
</P>
<P>
Some Chinese newspapers have reported the country's training of
astronauts.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Residents Evacuate North Villages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Israeli residents
left northern towns and villages, fearing Hezbollah revenge
attacks following Thursday's Israeli strikes on the guerrilla
group's bases inside Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
According to an Israel Radio report, by this morning, at least
7,000 people, especially youngsters, moved out from their homes to
areas out of Hezbollah's Katyusha rocket range.
</P>
<P>
Israel Air Force helicopter gunships and fighter bombers
Thursday blasted Hezbollah targets, including the group's
operation center in Beirut, which was the first time the Israeli
army attacked the Lebanese capital since the 1982 Lebanon War.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media pointed out that the anticipated retaliation for
the Katyusha rocket attacks earlier this week was seen as a clear
message to Hezbollah leaders that Israel would not tolerate
attacks against its civilians.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah vowed to retaliate against the attacks on Thursday
night, and a number of Katyusha rockets were reportedly fired at
the Israeli border town of Kyriat Shmona this morning.
</P>
<P>
No details about the attacks are available at the movement.
</P>
<P>
Israel's raids deep into Lebanon raised tensions along the
northern border and the in the "security zone" to a fever pitch,
as the Israeli army and the South Lebanese Army troops were on
full alert and all emergency services in the North were on standby
in case of Katyusha rocket attacks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the evacuation of residents from Kyriat Shmona and
other border towns and villages was decided upon at emergency
meetings of council leaders in their communities.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army did not issue any instructions for people to
leave, although throughout Thursday it reiterate calls to
residents to remain in bomb shelters and security rooms.
</P>
<P>
By last night, more than 1,500 people had left Kyriat Shmona on
buses organized by the municipality in conjunction with community
centers.
</P>
<P>
More than one thousand others moved out on regular and extra
buses and in their own cars, to stay with relatives in Haifa and
central parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Reports from other parts of the Galilee said at least 2,000
people had made similar moves from their homes to safer regions
after long nights in bomb shelters and security rooms.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli army spokesman said that most schools in the North
are closed today, and the situation would be reviewed at the
beginning of next week.

</P>
<P>
Local parks, which are usually visited by strollers during
daytime, now have become bustling with noise and excitement at
dawn and dusk.
</P>
<P>
More and more Beijingers, old and young, have chosen dancing as
their spare time fun hobby, giving Karaoke the chop.
</P>
<P>
Parks and open pubic places along the streets, and spare land
in front of high buildings have become makeshift "ballrooms".
</P>
<P>
Yangko (a popular rural folk dance), folk dances, ballroom
dancing, ballet and many other kinds of Chinese and Western style
dances again have become popular.
</P>
<P>
A dozen Yangko dancing groups have been formed, and are very

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Holds Economic Conference on Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 12 (Xinhua) -- A large-sized economic
conference was held here today with a focus on promoting Hong Kong
as an international financial and trading center, a shipping and
civil aviation center and a communications center.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Zhou Nan, director of the Xinhua News
Agency Hong Kong Branch, said that Hong Kong is facing an
unprecedented development opportunity in the latter part of its
transitional period.
</P>
<P>
Zhou listed four factors that have significant influences on
Hong Kong's future development direction -- the "China factor",
the principle of "one country, two systems", the realization of
"Hong Kong people running Hong Kong" and efforts to maintain
stability.
</P>
<P>
Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of
the State Council, delivered a luncheon speech on Hong Kong
residents' nationality and right of abode.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong residents of Chinese descent can keep
their permanent residence status without sacrificing their foreign
travel documents after 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said that according to the proposal of the Preparatory
Committee for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR),
"returned" emigrants" of Chinese origin, who have emigrated
overseas and obtained foreign passports, are Chinese nationals
unless they declare a change of nationality.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, they can retain their right of abode in
Hong Kong whenever they come back, either before or after 1997.

Wang Xuebing, chairman and president of the Bank of China, said
that with 1997 approaching, the Hong Kong banking industry is
facing unparalleled historic opportunities.
</P>
<P>
He said Hong Kong can only maintain its position as an
international financial center through attracting various
international and local financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
He said the Bank of China will spare no effort in working with
the Hong Kong monetary authority to maintain the stability of the
Hong Kong monetary system.
</P>
<P>
Hiroshi Zaizen, senior managing director of Mitsubishi
Corporation, said that in addition to its current function as a

<P>
Lu said that HKSAR Chinese nationals who want to have a change
of nationality can, with valid documentation, make a declaration
to the appropriate authority responsible for nationality
applications.
</P>
<P>
As for the question of whether a declaration is needed or not,
Lu said: "The autonomy is in their hands," They can make a
declaration and choose to reside in Hong Kong as foreign
nationals, or they can choose not to make a declaration and
continue to live in Hong Kong as Chinese nationals.
</P>
<P>
However, Lu ruled out the possibility of declaration for those
who possess various forms of British passports because the Chinese
government opposes the British Nationality Selection Scheme (BNSS)
-- in his words, "a wrong act by the British government". But
China would not discriminate against Hong Kong people who have
participated in the scheme, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Returned emigrants" who come back to Hong Kong as foreign
nationals do not satisfy the requirement of "having Hong Kong as
their permanent place of residence". Nevertheless, he said: "They
do enjoy the right to enter, the right to live and the right to
work,"
</P>
<P>
If they want to become permanent residents in Hong Kong again,
they must, according to the SAR Basic Law, live in Hong Kong
consecutively for seven years or more, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lu, who arrived here Thursday, is on a nine-day visit to Hong
Kong with a keynote speech at the large-sale economic conference,
jointly organized by the Better Hong Kong Foundation and the Hong
Kong Trade Development Council.
</P>
<P>
Lu, also secretary-general of the PC for the future SAR, is
here to seek advice from all circles on the founding of the
Selection Committee, which will choose the first chief executive
of the SAR government and members of the Provisional Legislative
Council.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's United Transport and
Taxis Association (UTTA) has increased transport fares by 20
percent with effect from next Tuesday, local daily "Times of
Zambia" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted UTTA National Chairman Willie Nsanda as
saying that the increase had been necessitated by rising costs of
operations including the fuel hike which was announced on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The operation costs of transport operators had increased in
the last three months and UTTA had no option but to increase
fares to keep operating profitably, he explained.

The Zambia National Oil Company increased prices of petroleum

HONG KONG, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong residents of Chinese
descent can keep their permanent residence status without
sacrificing their foreign travel documents after 1997, said a
high-ranking Chinese official here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a luncheon speech, Lu Ping, director of the Hong
Kong and Macao Affairs Office under the State Council, said: "This
 flexible and practical policy is adopted specifically for
allowing Hong Kong residents to travel conveniently without
contravening the basic principle under the Chinese Nationality
Law, which does not recognize dual nationality."
</P>
<P>
Lu was attending the Hong Kong Economic Development Conference
as a keynote speaker, who talked about the Question of Hong Kong
Residents' Nationality and Right of Abode.
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that those Hong Kong residents who are of
Chinese descent and born in Chinese territory including Hong Kong
are Chinese nationals.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Lu gave a detailed explanation of the proposal,
which was put forward in March by the Preparatory Committee (PC)
for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and is yet
 to be approved by the National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
According to the proposal, "returned emigrants" of Chinese
origin, who have emigrated overseas and obtained foreign
passports, are Chinese nationals unless they declare a change of
nationality. Therefore, Lu said, they can retain their right of
abode in Hong Kong whenever they come back, either before or after
 1997.
</P>
<P>
They can use documents issued by foreign governments to travel
to other countries or places. However, Lu added, they are not
entitled to consular protection in the HKSAR and other parts of
China.

<HEADLINE> Tazara Workers' Strike Enters Fourth Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Large quantities of cargo are
marooned at the Dar es Salaam port of Tanzania and the Kapiri
Mposhi station of Zambia, the two ends of the Tanzania-Zambia
Railway (Tazara), as the strike by some 2,000 Tazara workers
entered the fourth day today.
</P>
<P>
The workers in the Zambian sector of Tazara downed tools on
Tuesday, protesting a meager pay increase of 5 percent awarded to
them by the management. The striking workers are demanding a 150
percent pay rise.
</P>
<P>
The strike has paralyzed operations of the Zambian sector of
the 1,680-kilometer railway which was built with Chinese
assistance in 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the strike, Zambian Communications and Transport
Deputy Minister Gilbert Mululu said the government was monitoring
the situation.
</P>
<P>
The government would also mobilize a Zambian railways team to
move the marooned cargo, should the work stoppage continue, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He maintained that the strike was illegal and the workers
should follow the laid down procedures in presenting their
grievances.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Employs International Convention in Border Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Border trade is being carried out
in line with international conventions in the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianguo, director of the Autonomous Regional Bureau of
Foreign Economic Cooperation and Trade, said that 35 percent of
Xinjiang's border trade volume totalling 695 million US dollars
last year was cash trade.
</P>
<P>
"We plan to raise the percentage up to 80 percent to 90 percent
in two to three years," he added.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang began to undertake cash trading with central Asian
countries in 1994.
</P>
<P>
While raising the percentage of cash trade, the autonomous
regional government is encouraging foreign trade companies to
expand economic and technical cooperation with neighboring
countries, opening enterprises and mines in, and selling
equipment, and sending technicians to the countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it will import technology and equipment in heavy
industries, as well as energy from these countries.
</P>
<P>
The past two years have witnessed the northwest China's region
setting up a border trade coordination committee to unify
commodity prices and keep market order.
</P>
<P>
The regional government has streamlined the system of border
trade, and straightened out or scrapped several hundred
unqualified firms and strictly controlled individual business
people going abroad to do business, while punishing those
businessmen who sell fake products.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang will carry out the trade policy of replacing any
products not up to specifications, and offering after-sales
service, Wei said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup:Tamil Attack on Colombo Port Thwarted  (By Li Zheng) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan navy and port
security forces thwarted an attempt by the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) to launch a major attack on Colombo Port this
morning.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitnesses, two Sea Tiger boats tried to ram
into an army warehouse after entering the harbor premises while
the crew members fired indiscriminately at harbor workers.
</P>
<P>
The port security forces and the navy quickly intervened and
blasted the two boats.
</P>
<P>
The military said the boats, laden with bombs, were manned by
LTTE suicide bombers who had come for a major attack on the port
and the vessels anchored there.
</P>
<P>
According to the state Broadcasting Corporation, one civilian
was injured while three bodies of the LTTE Sea Tigers have been
recovered by the navy, who is conducting a search for more bodies.
</P>
<P>
The radio said the Sea Tigers failed to cause any serious
damage to either the ships or the premises.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been launching a 13-year war for a separate Tamil
state. The conflict has claimed over 50,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have been targeting key installations in Colombo
since they were displaced from their stronghold in Jaffna city
last December.
</P>
<P>
The military has recently unearthed large quantities of arms
and ammunition from various places in Colombo, which they believe
were hidden by the rebels for use when necessary.
</P>
<P>
With the festive Sinhala and Hindu New Year holidays now going
on until Sunday, police have warned of possible further attacks by
the LTTE rebels in and around Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Security in the Sri Lankan capital has been strengthened and
security forces were put on alert.

</P>
<P>
The bill, passed with minor amendment, establishes the Uganda
Wildlife Authority which shall ensure sustainable
management of wildlife conservation areas, develop and recommend
policies on wildlife management to the government.
</P>
<P>
The bill also seeks to provide conservation and sustainable
management of wildlife and wildlife resources.

<P>
The Wildlife Authority will also coordinate the implementation
of government policies on wildlife management among others.
</P>
<P>
Wildlife is the country's attraction for foreign tourists. Its
protection in the country has made big progress. Due to the
strict measures taken by the government to fight against poaching
and other forms of disturbances in recent years, elephant
population in the country has increased from 1,000 at the
beginning of the 1980s to over 3,000 at present.

<HEADLINE> Cableway Opens On China's Most Dangerous Mountain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Tourists can ascend China's most
dangerous mountain in style - after the opening of a new cablecar.
</P>
<P>
The cableway has been built on Huashan Mountain in Shaanxi
Province, a popular tourist attraction, known as the steepest and
most dangerous mountain in China.
</P>
<P>
The 1,500-m-long cableway has 34 coaches that can carry 1,000
passengers an hour. A single tour takes only seven
minutes. Tourists can drive to the cableway station by a mountain
highway.
</P>
<P>
Located in Huayin City, 120 km to the east of Shaanxi capital
Xi'an, Huashan Mountain offers tourists picturesque scenery, as
well as a thrilling experience. The only way up and down the
mountain takes tourists much longer, and can be very
dangerous, especially for the elderly people and the frail.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the cableway started in July 1994 and took
18 months. The whole project cost 80 million yuan. A Singaporean
company undertook the work, together with a local company.
</P>
<P>
Tourism observers believe that the cableway will help bring
more tourists to the mountain, as it offers another choice to
tourists of different ages and conditions, and more importantly,
it keeps to the original beauty of the mountain.

BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Local enterprises which have the

</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 1995 the export volume of these

<HEADLINE> Peres: Israel Not Interested in New Understanding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Shimon Peres
said last night that a new understanding is not necessary
concerning South Lebanon, according to a report of Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Peres made the statement after Israel made a show of force by
bombarding Beirut in an effort to uproot Hezbollah's operating
center in the city. This was the first time for Israel warplanes
to attack the Lebanese capital since 1982 Lebanese War.
</P>
<P>
A top security source admitted the net effect of the action is
changing the rules of the game as set in the aftermath of
Accountability in 1993. The U.S. brokered a deal whereby Israeli
civilians and Lebanese civilians north of the "security zone"
would be outside the parameters of the fighting. A violation by
one side would invite the retaliation by the other. In short, the
"security zone" was supposed to be a boxing ring.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a special meeting of the Knesset Foreign Affairs
and Defense Committee held in Tel Aviv to discuss the situation in
the north, Peres said Israel is still committed to the
understanding, not just a violation of it.
</P>
<P>
Lt.-Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, Chief of General Staff, said at
the meeting that Hezbollah is in shock from yesterday's Israeli
actions, but will recover. Israel is waiting for response and does
not rule out attacks in the "security zone" and elsewhere.

the center to "publicize Deng Xiaoping's theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics, and policy decisions of the
Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and the Central Military
Commission."
</P>
<P>
He said that the center "should also actively publicize the
third generation of the Party's leading collective with Comrade
Jiang Zemin at the core, and the successes scored by the PLA, and
serve PLA officers and men."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the center would attach paramount
importance to politics, adhere to the principle of the Party
spirit, and improve the quality of programs and its work style.

<HEADLINE> One Million Expected to Visit Cuba This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Given a 50 percent rise in
tourists in the first quarter, Cuba is expecting to receive a
total of one million visitors this year.
</P>
<P>
About 297,000 visited Cuba from January to March, according to
Tourism Minister Osmany Cienfuegos at a press briefing today.
</P>
<P>
With the quarterly 50 percent improvement over the same period
of last year, Cienfuegos said, the government has raised its
initial expectation of annual 900,000 arrivals.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Cuba received 740,000 visitors, mostly from Canada,
Italy, Germany and Spain, earning some one billion U.S. dollars in
hard currency.
</P>
<P>
Gross earnings by the tourism sector, the minister said, have
surpassed that of the sugar industry to become Cuba's main foreign
exchange earner.
</P>
<P>
Cuba's tourism boom has been gaining momentum since about five
years ago.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Foreign Trade Sees Modest Improvement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's foreign trade saw a
positive trend in the past eight months with export rising
modestly while import growth slowing down, according to the
country's central bank.
</P>
<P>
A press release on the nation's current economic situation
issued by Nepal Rastra Bank Thursday said the total trade deficit
during the first eight months of the 1995-96 fiscal year,
beginning from last July, was about 622 million US dollars with a
growth of 23.6 percent, compared with 53.1 percent in the same
period of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
During the review period, exports increased 4.4 percent
compared with a 5.8 percent decline last year while the growth of
imports slowed down to 17.8 percent from 28.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysis of trade in the period shows that exports to India,
Nepal's No. 1 trade partner, decelerated while imports from India
began to accelerate, the central bank said, adding that an
opposite trend was witnessed in the case of trade with third
countries.
</P>
<P>
This may be attributed to the exchange rate movement of Nepali
rupee against convertible currencies in relation to the fixed rate
between Nepali and Indian currencies, the bank explained.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the bank said that sluggish growth in revenue
collection along with a higher expenditure growth had resulted in
widening fiscal deficit in the last eight months, causing a higher
inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
Consumer's price index increased 8.8 percent in March 1996
compared with 7.4 percent during the same period last year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Agrees to Return Key Base to Japan: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Japan and the United States have
agreed to return to Japan a key U.S. air base in Okinawa
Prefecture within five years, a leading Japanese business daily
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Property used for the Futemma air base in Okinawa will be
returned to local landowners with the transfer of base operations
to the Kadena air base on the southwestern Japanese island, the
Nihon Keizai Shiumbun said in a dispatch from Washington.
</P>
<P>
The return of land occupied by the Futemma base has been at the
center of ongoing bilateral negotiations on how to consolidate and
reduce U.S. military facilities in Okinawa before President Bill
Clinton's visit to Japan starting April 16.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, U.S. military facilities, including those
in Okinawa and the Iwakuni base in Yamaguchi Prefecture, western
Japan, will be consolidated, paving the way for a reduction of
U.S. troops in Okinawa, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
Okinawa, some 1,600 kilometers southwest of Tokyo, is home to
about 75 percent of U.S. military facilities in Japan and nearly
half of the 47,000 U.S. troops stationed in the country under a
security treaty between Tokyo and Washington.
</P>
<P>
Okinawans have long demanded a reduction in the huge
U.S. military presence on their island, a demand fueled by the
rape of a 12-year-old Okinawa school girl last September for which
three U.S. servicemen have been sentenced to prison terms.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Urged to Simplify Export-Import Procedures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- A UN official has urged the
government of Indonesia to simplify its export and import
procedures to promote the country's trade and economy.
</P>
<P>
The call was contained in a recent study by R.N. Shipvuri,
management consultant for Indonesia of the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).
</P>
<P>
According to the UN official, Indonesia's 36 government and
private agencies are presently involved in the country's import
and export activities, requiring importers and exporters to
process 121 documents.
</P>
<P>
Among the government agencies which contribute to the disarray
of procedures are the customs and excise office, the port
administration, the freight-forwarding firms, insurance companies,
guarantors and banking agencies.
</P>
<P>
Shipvuri said that the long line of procedures made the
movement of goods from one point to another a very arduous job.
</P>
<P>
The situation has limited the government's ability to boost the
country's trade and economy.
</P>
<P>
Shipvuri suggested that the government work harder to reduce
red tape so that it does not pose an obstacle to economic growth.
</P>
<P>
He also offered a three-step solution to the problem.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, the government must identify the bottlenecks occurring
in import-export procedures and design solutions.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, they must systematically rationalize trade and
information procedures as well as documentation inflow.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, reduction of the costs of trade procedures can be
accomplished by increasing the use of information technology and
electronic databases.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Seeks to Promote Trade with Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Fiji Deputy Prime Minister Ratu
Timoci Visikula left here for home today after concluding his
three-day semi-official visit to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, Visikula told the local press that
cooperation with Indonesia will particularly focus on research
projects in the fields of agriculture and forestry, which will
include exchanges of human resources in those fields for
short-term periods.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to the headquarters of the Asian and Pacific
Coconut Community (APCC) in Jakarta Thursday, Visikula said that
Fiji sought the community's assistance in appointing a resource
person for the establishment of a coconut authority in Fiji.
</P>
<P>
Fiji is one of the 14 members of the APCC.
</P>
<P>
The coconut authority is expected to help revive Fiji's coconut
market. Up to 20 percent of Fiji's population of 800,000 people
depend on coconut-based industries.
</P>
<P>
The APCC is an inter-governmental organization established in
1969 to promote, coordinate and harmonize activities in the
coconut industry.
</P>
<P>
Visikula also invited Indonesian investors to do business in
his country. He said that Fiji is presently promoting its tourism
sector, and has already developed garment, agricultural and
processing industries.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Sees 20 percent Drop in House Building in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Thai real estate developers
launched 562 housing projects combining 142,023 units in Bangkok
and surrounding areas in 1995, down 20 percent from the figures in
1994.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from the National Housing Authority, of
the total, 64,979 units were located in Bangkok and 77,044 units
in the provinces surrounding the capital.
</P>
<P>
The big drop was seen in the last quarter of 1995 due to the
impact of heavy flooding and the Bank of Thailand's tight monetary
policy on extending loans to the property sector, said the report
released by the state enterprise under the Administration of the
Thai Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The report also indicated that the housing projects were
smaller in 1995, averaging 253 units per project rather than 277
units per project in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for this change were the increased land costs
and the limited availability of land plots near the city, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Of the units launched in the last quarter of 1995, 26.7 percent
were priced between 300,000-500,000 baht (12,000-20,000 US
dollars), 20.7 percent between 700,000-900,000 baht (28,000-36,000
dollars), and 13,5 percent between 1.5-2.0 million baht
(60,000-80,000 dollars), the report added.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Lack of Civility a Problem in America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Incivility has been getting
worse over the past decade in the United States, according to the
result of a poll released today.
</P>
<P>
The 1,005 adults responding to the poll overwhelmingly agreed
that incivility contributes to increased violence and they pointed
to political campaigns, prime-time television, rock music and talk
radio as the culprits.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-eight percent of the respondents to the Bozell
Worldwide-U.S. News &AMP; World Report Quality Quotient poll said lack
of civility is a serious problem in the society.
</P>
<P>
Ninety-one percent said incivility contributes to increased
violence, and nearly 80 percent said the problem has worsened over
the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Only a minority said lawyers, journalists, police and other
oft-maligned professionals were uncivil.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-one percent said driving habits have become somewhat or
much less civil over the past 10 years. Sixty-seven percent said
people are somewhat or much less civil in speaking with others or
using appropriate language.
</P>
<P>
In addition, some 75 percent said things are somewhat or much
less civil in terms of "keeping one's children under control."
</P>
<P>
The poll, to be published in the U.S. News' April 20 edition,
was conducted by KRC Research &AMP; Consulting and the magazine's
polling consultants from February 8 through February 12.

<HEADLINE> S Korea's Ruling Party Fails to Retain Majority in  National Assembly elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The New Korea Party (NKP), South
Korea's ruling party, failed to win half of the parliamentary
seats in the 15th general elections in the country thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the final results of ballot-counting released here
this morning, the ruling NKP has secured 139 seats, while the main
opposition National Congress for New Politics (NCNP) won 79 seats.
</P>
<P>
The conservative opposition United Liberal Democrats (ULD), the
fourth biggest party entering the elections, has enjoyed an
unexpected victory by getting 50 seats, while the opposition
Democratic Party (DP), the third biggest entering the elections,
only obtained 15 seats. The remaining 16 seats went to independent
candidates.
</P>
<P>
At stake in the elections were 299 seats, of which 253 were
district constituency seats elected by direct popular voting and
the remaining 46 determined by the proportion of votes cast for
each party under the national representation system.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,385 candidates were running for the 253 seats by
popular voting, chalking up a competition ratio of 5.5:1, the highest
in the South Korean National Assembly election history.
</P>
<P>
The Central Election Management Committee (CEMC) said that only
20.12 million people or 63.9 percent of the 31.49 million eligible
voters cast their votes in Thursday's elections. The voter turnout
rate was down 8 percent from the 71.9 percent in the 14th general
elections in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Election watchers here attributed the lower turnout to the public
disgust over negative campaigns by candidates and their parties.
</P>
<P>
The ruling NKP, which was 11 seats short of winning the majority,
is expected to gain control of the National Assembly by drawing
independent and opposition lawmakers into its folds.

<HEADLINE> Perry: U.S. to Tighten Controls on Mass Destruction Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States is making
new efforts to combat the growing threat from weapons of mass
destruction, U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry said here today.
</P>
<P>
Unveiling a Pentagon report on weapons proliferation at a press
briefing, Perry said the rapid pace of technological development
poses new challenges for the Pentagon to control the spread of
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Some technologies and products, once under strict international
controls, "are now available essentially by mail order" from Radio
Shack, a chain of electronic hardware stores, he said.
</P>
<P>
With the end of the Cold War, the threat of nuclear retaliation
that worked so well during the past few decades may not be enough
to deter terrorists from using weapons of mass destruction, Perry
said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government will therefore intensify efforts to counter
terrorists threatening to use chemical, biological or nuclear
weapons against the United States and its allies.
</P>
<P>
Methods outlined in the Pentagon report include greater use of
intelligence gathering, programs to safely dispose of bomb-grade
nuclear materials taken out of former Soviet states, and
development of new military capabilities to protect against
weapons of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Japan Near Agreement on Troop Cut in Okinawa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Japan
are near an agreement on a plan to move some of American troops
from Okinawa to other parts of Japan, a spokesman for the Pentagon
said here today.
</P>
<P>
"We are nearing agreement and we should be able to announce
something soon," Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon told reporters when
briefing them on the forthcoming visit by U.S. President Bill
Clinton to Japan next week.
</P>
<P>
But the spokesman declined to give any details of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Other Pentagon officials told reporters that the military plan
will be discussed at a meeting between U.S. Defense Secretary
William Perry and his Japanese counterpart, Hideo Usui, in Tokyo
next Monday, one day before Clinton's two-day Japan trip.
</P>
<P>
Japanese and U.S. officials have been working intensively since
last fall to find ways to overcome growing resistance in Okinawa
to keeping U.S. troops there.
</P>
<P>
The rape of a 12-year-old schoolgirl in Okinawa by three
U.S. servicemen last September triggered off bitter protests
against U.S. military presence on the island. Three
U.S. servicemen were convicted of the crime last month.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of the 47,000 U.S. service personnel and 75 percent
of the U.S. military facilities in Japan are on Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
Bacon said the overall U.S. troop level in all of Japan would
remain at 47,000 if some of the American troops were moved to
elsewhere in Japan.
</P>
<P>
"The most important part of that agreement is that it will
maintain the U.S. security presence in Japan at current levels
because the U.S. and Japan agree that a robust U.S. military
presence in Japan is a fundamental building block of Asian
security," he said.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Logging Runs Rampant in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- A senior Indonesian official
Thursday warned of serious illegal logging in the country and
called for a comprehensive tackling of the problem.
</P>
<P>
At a national meeting of the Integrated Forest Security Team,
Minister of Forestry Djamaludin Suryohadikusumo said illegal
logging is running rampant and in a more blatant manner in almost
all of the forest areas in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
He said the ministry has received an increasing number of
complaints on the issue from the Mailbox 5000, designed to
accommodate all complaints from the general public related to
public services and law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that some of the complaints implicated
government officials, military officers, concessionaires and
industrialists in the illegal logging.
</P>
<P>
The Integrated Forest Security Team was set up last year to
tackle the problem of illegal forest exploitation across the
archipelago.
</P>
<P>
It found 549 cases of illegal logging last year, involving
80,126 cubic meters of logs and 81,516 cubic meters of processed
woods.
</P>
<P>
However, exact data are not yet available on the amount and
trade of illegal logging or the financial losses it incurs to
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government will take stronger measures
this year against those found to be illegally logging the
country's forests.

<HEADLINE> UN Reports No Breakthrough in Verifying Iraqi Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has not provided
enough evidence to show that it no longer has chemical and
biological weapons and ballistic missiles with a range more than
150 kilometers, the United Nations said today.
</P>
<P>
In a routine report to the Security Council, the U.N. Special
Commission responsible for destroying Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction listed major areas of concern:
</P>
<P>
-- Biological weapons. Iraq had filled close to 200 bombs,
shells and missiles with germs shortly before the 1991 Gulf War
and deployed some of them at an air base.
</P>
<P>
-- Radiological weapons, which scatter deadly radioactive
material without causing a nuclear explosion, needed
verification. Iraq said its program was abandoned years ago, when
it destroyed 25 bombs. But it has not yet accounted for 75 other
bombs sent to its al-Qa Qa facility.
</P>
<P>
-- Missiles of all types. The report said plans for long-range
missiles had been "more advanced than previously declared."
</P>
<P>
The report said that items were "partially or totally concealed
and all materials relevant to their existence were unilaterally
obliterated as it was believed that their revelation would
complicate matters and prolong with the process with the U.N."
</P>
<P>
But in fact this made the task of both the commission and Iraq
much more difficult and delayed its completion, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Under Resolution 687 of the U.N. Security Council, Iraq has to
destroy all chemical and biological weapons and ballistic missiles
with a range more than 150 kilometers before the council can move
to lift economic sanctions it imposed on Iraq after the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions, reviewed by the council every 60 days, have
remained unchanged since they were first enacted. The next review
is due May 6, but the report makes it virtually certain the
embargo will remain intact.

<HEADLINE> Top EU Trade Official Raps U.S. Sanction Against Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A top European Union (EU)
trade official threatened today to take action against a U.S. law
that allows legal suits against those who do business with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from talks with U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher, visiting European Commission Vice President Sir Leon
Brittan said the new legislation is "contrary to the friendly
relations between Europe and the United States."
</P>
<P>
"We reserve the right to take whatever action we are advised is
open to us to do with that legislation,'' he said in capacity as
the 15-nation EU's chief trade negotiator.
</P>
<P>
At the center of the controversy was a part of the U.S. law
that permits Americans to sue foreign companies in American courts
because the non-Americans have bought property confiscated by the
government of Cuban President Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
Referring also to similar bills pending in U.S. Congress
against those who deal with Iran and Libya, Brittan said: "We have
doubts about the legality of those three pieces of legislation."
</P>
<P>
"It is open to European countries to take action in a variety
of ways to deal with them," Brittan said, adding "I hope very much
that wiser forces will still prevail."

<HEADLINE> Nepal Opposition Protest Police Killing, Price Hikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's opposition parties
Thursday lashed out at the coalition government for recent police
killings and price hikes in a protest letter to Prime Minister
Sher Bahadur Deuba, the official RSS news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The letter, signed by eight leftist parties headed by the main
opposition Communist Party of Nepal (UML), accused the government
of extra-judicial killings and arrests and the torture of
political party workers on framed charges.
</P>
<P>
The opposition demanded in the letter that the government check
the on-going killing and violence, take firm action against those
found guilty and release all innocent people arrested.
</P>
<P>
Reports said more than 20 people had been killed and nearly 200
arrested in police operations in the past two months.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Deuba said after receiving the letter that no
one would be allowed to commit killing and violence and he asked
the opposition to cooperate with the government in stopping such
activities.
</P>
<P>
The opposition also urged the government to withdraw its recent
decisions to raise prices of items that have a direct bearing on
the people's daily life, including petroleum products and chemical
fertilizers.

<HEADLINE> Jiangsu Becomes More Efficient in Energy Consumption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province has
increased energy use efficiency by practising economy and
optimizing its industrial structure.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released by the Jiangsu Provincial
Statistics Bureau, last year every 10,000 yuan (about 1,200 US
dollars) of its gross domestic product (GDP) was produced by
burning 2.4 tons of standard coal, down 39.8 percent in energy
consumption from 1990.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991 the country has invested 1.48 billion yuan (179
million US dollars) in the province to help 211 energy saving
projects. In addition, the province itself set aside 1.23 billion
yuan for energy saving.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu, an economic powerhouse in China, produced 515 billion
yuan in GDP last year, an increase of 15.4 percent over the
previous year. However, shortage of energy has long been a
bottleneck in the province's economic development.
</P>
<P>
In response to this problem, the province in recent years has
strengthened management, upgraded technology and closed a number
of heavy energy-consuming enterprises, including some mining firms.
</P>
<P>
Officials also attributed the change of energy consumption
structure to the development of capital- or technology-intensive
joint ventures and township enterprises. Last year, the actual use
of foreign investment by the province topped 5.3 billion US
dollars, 12 times of 1990's figure, while production value of the
rural enterprises has also improved remarkably.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian Parliamentarians Condemn U.S. Law on Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine's parliamentary groups today
denounced the new U.S. law toughening economic sanctions against
Cuba, which they said would affect Ukrainian children who are in
Cuba for medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton last month signed the
Helms-Burton bill aimed at driving foreign investors from Cuba in
retaliation for the shooting down of two U.S. planes piloted by
Cuban exiles on February 24. Cuba has accused the United States of
violating its air space.
</P>
<P>
The law allows U.S. citizens to file lawsuits against
individuals and companies who are using property or assets
previously owned by them and confiscated by the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the parliamentary groups said that certain
provisions of the new U.S. law would pose problems for the
continued medical treatment in Cuba of young Ukrainian victims of
the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine condemned the
tightened sanctions against Cuba and the U.S. violation of Cuba's
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the U.S. move had also been condemned by many
other countries which have normal trade ties with Cuba, such as
Canada and Mexico.

BANGKOK, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Saengchai Sunthornwat, director
of the Mass Communications Organization of Thailand (MCOT), was
killed by a gunman in Nonthaburi province Thursday evening, the
local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
Saengchai was appointed about two years ago the director of the
MCOT, a state enterprise that operates TV Channel Nine, Seven FM
and two AM radio stations and the Thai News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He was struck in the rear left shoulder in front of his house
at Pak Kret at 8 p.m. local time (1300 GMT) when he was being
driven home by his wife after dinner, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The gunman fled on a motorcycle with another man after firing a
single shot, hitting Saengchai through a rear door window of his
Mercedes-Benz car.
</P>
<P>
Saengchai died 45 minutes later in a nearby hospital after an
extensive loss of blood.
</P>
<P>
Police are looking into the motive of the killing. Some MCOT
sources said Saengchai's recent decision to revamp TV Channel Nine

<HEADLINE> Airport Fire Kills 21 in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A raging fire today occurred at the
Dusseldorf International Airport in western Germany, killing at
least 21 people and injuring some 60 others, a spokesman for the
airport was quoted by the local press as saying.
</P>
<P>
Many victims were suffocated by thick acrid smoke containing
corrosive hydrochloric acid and poisonous hydrocyanic acid. Among
them were several women, a policeman and a child, who were
asphyxiated to death in the elevator system.
</P>
<P>
The blaze, one of the worst disasters of its kind in a German
airport, broke out in the arrivals area around 16:25 p.m. (14:25
GMT) when the area was crowded with people, said firefighters and
police.
</P>
<P>
A witness said he saw sparks coming from a false ceiling, where
the fire seemed to break out, rapidly sending the choking smoke
through conduits and passageways.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the disaster was under investigation, but some
people said welding work might have been responsible since there
was no indication of a criminal attack.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the efforts of some 1,000 firefighters, the fire was
finally extinguished.
</P>
<P>
But rescue workers and relatives are still searching for
casualties, some of whom received emergency medical service in
tents set up at the airport.
</P>
<P>
All hospitals in the Dusseldorf region were put on alert to
take in the injured.
</P>
<P>
The Dusseldorf International Airport, Germany's second busiest
airport after Frankfurt in terms of passenger volume, has been
shut down due to the disaster and access roads to the airport were
also closed. Air traffic was diverted to the Cologne-Bonn
airport.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Russian Constructive Partnership Vital: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The China visit by Russian
President Boris Yeltsin will inject new vitality into the
development of bilateral friendship and cooperation between the
two countries, a senior Chinese diplomat said here today.
</P>
<P>
He said that China is attaching great importance to this visit,
and has been carefully preparing for it for a long time.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat also commented that the Sino-Russian Partnership
is a new type of state-to-state relations which has a great
vitality.
</P>
<P>
The official, from the East European and Central Asian Affairs
Department of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, was commenting in an
interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Russian
President Boris Yeltsin agreed in September 1994, during Jiang's
visit to Russia, to build and develop Sino-Russian constructive
ties into a new type of state-to-state relations, from a long-term
view facing the 21st century and a strategic height.
</P>
<P>
This new type of relations, which is non-confrontation,
non-alignment, and not aimed at third parties, is built on the
basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-Existence, while
focusing on the fundamental interest and aspirations of each
country and people, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the official said, such a relationship will have a great
vitality, which can enable China and Russia to maintain a
long-term and stable good-neighborly friendship, and to conduct
reciprocal cooperation with complete equality, despite influences
brought about by international and domestic changes, as well as
the different social systems.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that although the Cold War has come to an
end, the world is not peaceful, which is a result of hegemonism
and power politics.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China and Russia are two big countries in the
world, and the permanent members of the UN Security Council, the
official said, the development of bilateral friendship and
cooperation is undoubtedly an active contribution to pushing
forward the development of a multi-polarization of the world.
</P>
<P>
It is also an active contribution to the peace, stability and
development of the Asian-Pacific region, and the world at large,
added the official.
</P>
<P>
During the past few years, the friendly cooperation between
China and Russia in various fields like politics, economy and
trade, science and technology, and culture have been conducted
comprehensively, said the official.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's coffee exports in March
reached their lowest level since April 1989, the Brazilian
Federation of Coffee Exporters said today.
</P>
<P>
It said that the monthly export volume was 551,706 bags valued
at 78.61 million U.S. dollars, a 52 percent drop from March 1995.
</P>
<P>
March was the sixth straight month Brazil has failed to meet
the export quota of one million bags set by the Association of
Coffee-Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
The falling output resulted from the frost which hit
coffee-producing areas last June and July, the federation said.
</P>
<P>
According to the federation's statistics, Brazil's coffee
exports totaled about 1.7 million bags in the first three months
of this year, 23 percent less than in the first quarter of
1995. Export value stood at 239 million dollars, 47.5 percent less
than in the same period last year.

died and 20 have been saved after being trapped in a watery
coalpit in Neiqiu County in north China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
The rescued miners are now in normal condition, though they are
still recovering in hospital after their ordeal.

At the time, 64 miners were working in the mine, with 30 of
them had a narrow escape, while the other 34 became trapped.

<HEADLINE> India Beats South Korea in Six-Nation Hockey Tourney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- India defeated South Korea 3-0
in the first day of the six-nation pre-Olympic hockey tournament
in Atlanta on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It was India's first win in five matches with the Koreans, who
beat them in the Asian Games final of 1994.
</P>
<P>
India's match winner was one of their substitutes, Baljit Sing
Dhillon, who scored with flick shots from two of India's first
three corners, which came in the 25th and 44th minutes.
</P>
<P>
The match was marred by an incident in the 50th minute in
which the Korean Yang-kyun Jong swung his stick violently across
the legs of the Indian player Sanjeev Kumar, apparently in
retaliation for a blow on the head with an elbow.
</P>
<P>
Jong was shown a red card for a permanent suspension and was
later banned for the next three games of the tournament by the
tournament director, Eric Donegani of Canada.
</P>
<P>
It is one of the severest sentences for a red card offence in
an international tournament and means Jong can play only in the
final game of the tournament next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sanjeev Kumar, the Indian player involved in the incident, was
shown a yellow card (temporary suspension) but hobbled off and
took no further part in the game.
</P>
<P>
With both teams playing with ten players, two minutes later,
the Indian right-winger Mukesh Kumar hit a brilliant third goal
for the Indians to seal the game.
</P>
<P>
In other two matches of the day, Pakistan defeated Argentina
4-1 and Britain beat the United States 5-2.

Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress
(NPC), arrived here today for a 10-day official good-will visit to
Canada.
</P>
<P>
In a written speech released at the airport, Qiao described the
purpose of his Canada visit as "enhancing mutual understanding,
promoting friendship and cooperation and developing an all-round
relationship" between China and Canada.
</P>
<P>
China and Canada, Qiao said, are two influential Pacific
countries. In spite of great distance, the traditional friendship
and friendly exchanges between the two peoples can be traced back
to the time immemorial.
</P>
<P>
"As we both have a vast land and rich natural resources, thanks
to advantages in different areas of economic development, the

in political, economic, trade, scientific, technological,
cultural, educational and other fields has expanded considerably.
</P>

between China and Canada serves the fundamental interests of our
two peoples," he stressed.

of views with Canadian leaders on bilateral relations and on
issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
"During my visit, I would also like to see for myself your
achievements and successful experience in the nation-building
endeavor and to brief you on what is going on in China," Qiao said.
</P>
<P>
The NPC chairman was convinced that his current visit will
"help strengthen the friendship between our two peoples and
further develop the friendly relations and cooperation between
China and Canada which will extend beyond this century."
</P>
<P>
Qiao is here as the guest of Gilbert Adolph Parent, speaker of
the House of Commons, and Gildas Molgat, speaker of the Senate of

<HEADLINE> Ruling NKP Fails to Get Majority in Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 12 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's ruling party has
failed to garner half of the parliamentary seats in the 15th
general election held Thursday, initial counting of ballots showed
early today.
</P>
<P>
The ruling New Korea Party (NKP) had won or was leading in 122
district constituencies, according to results released at 5:00
a.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition National Congress for New Politics (NCNP)
led in 66 constituencies while the Democratic Party (DP), the
third largest party contesting the elections, was in the lead in
nine constituencies.
</P>
<P>
The conservative opposition party, the United Liberal Democrats
(ULD), had an unexpectedly strong showing, leading in 40
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
According to the Central Election Management Committee, 20.12
million South Koreans or 63.9 percent of 31.49 million eligible
voters turned out Thursday to vote.
</P>
<P>
The turnout rate was 8 percent down from 71.9 percent in the
previous general election in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Of the 299 parliamentary seats, 253 are to be filled by direct
popular vote while the remaining 46 seats are to be decided by the
proportion of votes cast for each party under a proportional
representation system.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,385 candidates were running for the 253 seats by
popular vote, meaning a ratio of 5.5 candidates to one seat, the
highest in the election history of the South Korean National
Assembly (parliament).
</P>
<P>
The ruling NKP, projected to end up with 140 seats, including
17 from proportional representation, is expected to woo
independent lawmakers or merge with the DP in order to command a
majority in parliament.
</P>
<P>
Despite its disappointing overall performance, the NKP is
leading for the first time in more than half of the districts in
Seoul.
</P>
<P>
The NCNP, which had hoped to capture upwards of 90 seats, is
likely to end up with 79 seats, including 13 from proportional
representation.
</P>
<P>
Its leader and 14th candidate on the NCNP party list, Kim
Dae-jung, has lost his bid for a seat.
</P>
<P>
The ULD, which is pushing for a constitutional amendment to
change the country's current presidential system, is likely to get
49 seats, including 9 from proportional representation.
</P>
<P>
The DP, with only 15 seats in hand including 6 from
proportional representation, is expected to woo independent
lawmakers or push for a merger with other parties so as to form a
floor negotiation group in parliament.

PARIS, April 11 (Xinhua) -- CSKA Moscow resisted a late
comeback by Real Madrid to beat them 74-73 and take third place
in the European club basketball championship on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Holders Real, who fell in the semifinals to Spanish rivals
Barcelona, due to play Panathinaikos in the final later in the
evening, enjoyed a brilliant start thanks to Zoran Savic.
</P>
<P>
The veteran Croat scored his team's first 10 points to give
them a 10-7 lead after four minutes.
</P>
<P>
Savic then fell heavily, hurting his knee, and was unable to
play until the last two minutes of the first half.
</P>
<P>
Moscow, producing fast, attractive basketball, fought back
and Real reached the break leading by only point, 35-34.
</P>
<P>
But Moscow moved in front after the interval and two crisp
triples by Latvian Gundars Vetra gave them a 51-44 lead with 12
minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for the young Russian side, Savic was back at
his best in the final stages and helped Real level at 73-73 with
two free throws 27 seconds from time.
</P>
<P>
But Vasili Karasev then gained two free throws, converting
one in the very last moments to give Moscow the edge.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Corps Sets Target for Grain Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Production and Construction
Corps of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has
set targets for grain production in the next five years in order
to provide a fairly comfortable life for their 2.2 million
members, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the corps' Commander Jin Yunhui, agriculture has
always been and will remain the top priority for them. They have
set annual production targets of 1.75 million tons of grain,
500,000 tons of cotton, 2 million tons of beets, and 200,000 tons
of commercial meat.
</P>
<P>
Jin told "China Daily" that two major steps would be taken to
meet the targets.
</P>
<P>
One is to open up some 670,000 ha of land, increasing the corps'
farm land to 1.03 million ha, also upgrading water conservancy
projects so as to increase the water supply by 2.5 billion square
metres.
</P>
<P>
The other is to expand research in and use of agricultural
technology. At present, it mainly refers to popularizing improved
seeds.
</P>
<P>
Jin said that research institutes of fine seeds will be
established in all production units and some good varieties will
be introduced from other countries to increase the yield.
</P>
<P>
To date, the corps has 126 scientific and research institutes
and 130,000 researchers.
</P>
<P>
"As long as we take agriculture as our top priority and develop
other industries on this basis, we will reach the aim of leading a
comfortable life by the end of this century, keeping pace with the
rest of the autonomous region," Jin said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China to Maintain Tight Rein on Narcotics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The state will continue to
tighten control over production and use of narcotic products and
encourage clinical use of narcotics for patients with serious
illnesses like cancer.
</P>
<P>
Narcotics experts should strengthen research on treatments for
drug addicts to help them avoid relapses, today's China Daily
quoted Zhang Wenkang, vice-minister of public health as saying.
</P>
<P>
The country has registered some 380,000 drug addicts, yet
Chinese police and medical experts believe the actual figure is
higher.
</P>
<P>
From 1991 to 1995, some 180,000 drug addicts received
obligatory treatment and another 10,000 volunteered to quit their
habit and asked for medical help.
</P>
<P>
Some drug-treatment institutions in China provide medical
treatment without further rehabilitation therapies. As a result,
some addicts may pick up the habit after they recover.
</P>
<P>
Zhang spoke in Beijing during the establishment of a second
National Expert Committee on Narcotics including 29 experts from
across the country.
</P>
<P>
The first committee, set up in 1992, mapped out a national
guideline for clinical use of narcotics on cancer patients. It
asked medical units to use narcotics rationally to help alleviate
pain for those seriously afflicted with cancer.
</P>
<P>
The committee also standardized therapy for drug addicts and
organized training to spread advanced techniques among Chinese
medical workers.
</P>
<P>
The committee has also encouraged the development of new
medicines to combat drug addiction.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, the State Council promulgated a set of
regulations on management of narcotics in 1987 which stipulated
that narcotics be put under special control. Action has also been
taken to crack down on drug smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Between 1991 and 1995, police across the country caught 46,000
drug smugglers. More than 7,300 were sentenced to death or life
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Police solved 144,000 drug-smuggling cased during the five
years and seized 17.1 tons of heroin, 10.8 tons of opium and 2.7
tons of drug "ice".

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Olympic 100 meters champion
Linford Christie criticised that the Olympic Games is growing
commercialism.
</P>
<P>
Christie told British television viewers: "To be honest, I
think the Olympics are losing their ideal.
</P>
<P>
"It started off as a great way for athletes to prove they are
the best. Now, there is all this talk about paying them, which I
don't agree with.
</P>
<P>
"I still think the Olympics should be totally prize or
money-free. Once you win at the Games, the sponsorship and
everything else comes through.
</P>
<P>
"They brought in the Dream Team (basketball), they brought in
the tennis -- I think they have lost it."
</P>
<P>
Christie has still to decide whether to defend the title he
won in Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
He said: "At the moment I'm just training hard, getting myself
into the best shape possible and making sure I'm healthy.
</P>
<P>
"I don't even think about the Olympics. I don't need the
pressure. If I decide to go, people will see me there."

<HEADLINE> HK Faces Unprecedented Opportunity: Senior Chinese  Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 12 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official said
here today that Hong Kong is facing an unprecedented development
opportunity in the latter part of its transitional period.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Nan, director of Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch,
called for an in-depth study of Hong Kong's current economic
situation and development directions in efforts to maintain Hong
Kong's prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech at a large-sized seminar titled "Towards
1997 and beyond -- Hong Kong Economic Development Conference",
Zhou elaborated on the factors that have significant influences on
Hong Kong's future development directions.
</P>
<P>
The "China factor," he stressed, has played a decisive role in
maintaining Hong Kong's stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
He said that the shaping-up of Hong Kong's status as an
international center of finance, trade, shipping and information
was coinciding with the progress of China's reforms, opening up
and modernizations.
</P>
<P>
"Just with the strong backing of its motherland, can Hong Kong
establish itself in an unassailable position in the acute
international competition," he said.
</P>
<P>
China's sustained, fast and healthy economic growth will
provide a huge opportunity for Hong Kong's financial, trade and
shipping business in the coming years, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that after Hong Kong returned to its motherland, the
economic relations between Hong Kong and the interior of the
country are expected to be further enhanced.
</P>
<P>
On the second factor, the principle of "one country, two
systems", he said it agrees with the interests of all the Chinese
people including the Hong Kong compatriots as well as those of
overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the principle has been stipulated in the Basic
Law and that the Chinese government's determination to implement
the principle of "one country, two systems" is firm and
unshakable.
</P>
<P>
"That serves as the legal guarantee for maintaining Hong Kong's
status as international financial, trade and shipping centers,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that after 1997 when Hong Kong gets rid of colonial
rule, the Basic Law will provide various capitals with a fair and
equitable investment environment and a sound legal system, which
will further help promote Hong Kong's development as an
international economic center.
</P>
<P>
The third factor is the realization of "Hong Kong people
running Hong Kong", he said, stressing that Hong Kong's prosperity
in the past has been created by the Hong Kong people, of which the
Chinese constitute a dominant majority, he said.
</P>
<P>
After 1997, Hong Kong people's wisdom and creativeness will be
brought into fuller play, he said.
</P>
<P>
In closing his speech, Zhou stressed the effects of stability
on the further development of Hong Kong's economy and the function
of Hong Kong's financial, trade and shipping centers.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Hong Kong has always been an economic center
instead of a political one.
</P>
<P>
He said the masses of the Hong Kong compatriots do not want to
see Hong Kong turned into a center for political struggle.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that any attempts, no matter under what excuses,
to change Hong Kong's status as an economic center will inevitably
undermine Hong Kong's stability as well as its prosperity and its
functions as a financial, trade and shipping center.

<HEADLINE> Panama Assures Impartial Management Of Canal After 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Panamanian President Ernesto
Perez Balladares pledged to run the Panama Canal with "efficiency
and impartiality" after his country takes over the waterway.
</P>
<P>
Balladares, now on a European tour, said Panama will be fully
responsible in the management of the canal after 1999, when the
U.S. authorities hand over its control under a 1977 treaty.
</P>
<P>
However, according to reports from Rome, Italy, where the
President is on a three-day visit, there may still be an American
military presence in Panama even after 1999.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference that U.S. and Panama are working on
a plan that will keep some of the American troops, currently 7,500
at eight bases along the canal, in his country.
</P>
<P>
His government, Balladares said, hopes to turn tropical forests
that are currently part of U.S. military bases into ecological
reserves, so as to attract more tourism.
</P>
<P>
The President's European tour was to promote his country's
investment opportunities after its take-over of the 81-year-old
waterway, considered crucially important for international trade.
</P>
<P>
He talked Wednesday with Italian Prime Minister Lamberto Dini,
visited Thursday the Rome-based United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization.

JOHANNESBURG, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The South African government
took actions on Thursday to diffuse a row threatening Cape Town's
bid for the 2004 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Randall van der Heever, a member of the parliamentary sports
and recreation committee, told a news conference it would mediate
to restore unity after a key promoter quit over a personality
clash.
</P>
<P>
"We will exert our influence to bring about maximum unity with
all role players. Shows of disunity are damaging to the bid," van
der Heever said.
</P>
<P>
Clive Keegan, deputy chairman of the Cape Town Olympic Bid
Company, said on Wednesday he was resigning because chief
executive Chris Ball had ignored his colleagues and shown no
interest in black empowerment, sports development or
environmental concerns.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary committee's chairman Lulu Xingwana said the
bid would not be derailed by the upset.
</P>
<P>
"We would not like to be dragged into personal allegations.
Our concern is to keep the bid on track," he said.
</P>
<P>
His committee has been involved as an observer since the bid
company was formed. The South African government is to decide
this month whether to underwrite the Cape Town bid.
</P>
<P>
Cape Town, Rome and Athens are front runners for the games
ahead of several other contenders. The International Olympic
Committee will make its choice next year.

<HEADLINE> Most Victims of Firearm Injuries Found to Be Black in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Most victims of firearms in
the United States are black and young people, a study of nonfatal
shootings from crimes said.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department study based on data from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention said 58 percent of firearm injuries
resulted from assaults. Crimes account for fewer than half of
firearm deaths.
</P>
<P>
The data on gun-related injuries came from 91 hospital
emergency rooms across the country in the year beginning June 1,
1992.
</P>
<P>
The study said hospitals treated 99,000 nonfatal wounds in the
one-year period, of which 58 percent resulted from assaults. One
shooting in five was accidental and 5 percent from suicide
attempts. The cause was unknown in 16 percent of the cases.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department said 47 percent of the 37,776 firearm
deaths in 1992 were caused by homicide or legal use of firearms
such as self-defense or police activity. Of the rest, 48 percent
were suicides and 4 percent accidental shootings.
</P>
<P>
An FBI survey of murders in that year said 53 percent of the
victims were black and 38 percent, 15-24 years old.
</P>
<P>
Of those suffering gunshot wounds, 59 percent were black, 19
percent, white and 14 percent, Hispanic. About half were aged
15-24, with 22 percent in the 15-19 age bracket.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Georgia officials made public
a 140 million U.S. dollar traffic-control system based on fiber
optics on Thursday, calling it the world's most advanced
technological network of its kind.
</P>
<P>
After being speeded up by a decade to be ready in time for the
Olympics, Georgia's Intelligent Transportation Systems will
employ an army of cameras, electronic signs and sychronized
traffic lights to guide commuters through the Atlanta
metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the state Transportation Department said the
system also will include 100 "talking" buses equipped with
preprogrammed, automated announcements. Nearly 90 buses owned by
the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority already have
location systems that use satellites.
</P>
<P>
In June, officials said, a four-month federal project called
Traveller Information Showcase will begin providing traffic news
on hand-held computers, in-vehicle navigation units, cable
television, the Internet and on interactive hotel television sets
at a local Holiday Inn.
</P>
<P>
High-tech traffic-control centers are ready to begin
operations in Atlanta and neighbouring DeKalb County. Three
suburban counties are expected to come on line before the
Olympics begin on July 19. A fourth, Cobb County, will not be
fully operational in time for the Games.
</P>
<P>
The Intelligent Transportation Systems operation is designed to
update information about traffic flow on interestate highways and
other major thoroughfares through a network of sensors and video
cameras.
</P>
<P>
Forty-one programmable electronic signs are to go into
operation over the three 12-lane interstate highways that
encircle the Atlanta area. Eight signs already are operable.
</P>
<P>
The system also includes 12 low-power radio units that
broadcast traffic updates on the 530 AM radio frequency.

<HEADLINE> NZ Dairy Farmers to Receive Higher Payout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, April 12 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand dairy farmers are
expected to receive the highest payout this season since the
mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
Estimates made by the Dairy Board show that the average dairy
farmer will get a payout of about 4 NZ dollars (2.68 US dollars)
for a kilogram of milk solids which is 60 NZ cents (40 US cents)
more than last season.
</P>
<P>
Board spokesman Neville Martin said the average dairy farmer
can expect an extra 10,000 to 12,000 NZ dollars (6,800 to 8,160 US
dollars) this year over last year, and the average earning for the
15,000 farmers will reach 70,000 dollars (47,600 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
He attributed the higher returns to a record production,
excellent late-season weather and positive international markets.

<P>
WELLINGTON, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand government is
being urged to take actin to address the serious problem of
poverty in the country.
</P>
<P>
Research from the Poverty Measurement Project, made up of
policy advisers and economic forecasters, show that 20 percent of
New Zealanders and 33 percent of all children are living below
the poverty line, a TVNZ report said today.
</P>
<P>
Project member Charles Waldegrave said NZ has the fastest
growing gap between rich and poor in the industrial world and the
government needs to urgently improve poor people's housing and
incomes.
</P>
<P>
But Health Minister Jenny Shipley dismissed the study, saying
the figures used are old.
</P>
<P>
She said the figures are based on a poverty level 10 percent
above international levels, and she finds it difficult to believe
such poverty exists in a country which has an established welfare
system.

<HEADLINE> Seven-Year-Old Girl Pilot Killed in Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A seven-year-old girl hoping
to set a record as the youngest pilot to fly across the United
States was killed Thursday when her plane crashed shortly after
takeoff in Wyoming, officials said.
</P>
<P>
"There were no survivors," said Charlene Scoville, spokeswoman
for United Medical Center in Cheyenne.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Jessica Dubroff, aged seven, there were two men
aboard the plane when it crashed. The two, apparently the girl's
father and a flight instructor, were also killed, Scoville said.
</P>
<P>
They were identified in earlier press reports as Lloyd Dubroff
and Joe Reid.
</P>
<P>
"The nose of the plane directly impacted the street. Needless
to say there was not a whole lot left," Ron Nimmo, an eyewitness
to the crash, told CNN.
</P>
<P>
It was "fairly obvious that there would be no survivors," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The single-engine plane went down on a street in a commercial
district within a larger residential neighborhood but officials
said no one was hurt on the ground.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the crash was being investigated, but Dick Royce,
a spokesman with the local police, told CNN that "definitely, the
weather is the cause" of the accident.
</P>
<P>
Royce noted there were heavy rains and hail in the area when
the plane went down shortly after takeoff from the Cheyenne
airport.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Agency (FAA), however, reported that other
aircraft were landing and taking off from the airport at around
the same time.
</P>
<P>
Whether Jessica was physically piloting the plane at the time
of the crash was not yet clear, but an FAA spokesman told CNN
that the "person who is legally responsible and physically in
control is the flight instructor."
</P>
<P>
Dubroff left San Francisco Wednesday with her father and her
flight instructor on what was meant to be an eight-day,
11,200-kilometer voyage.
</P>
<P>
Her itinerary was to include a stop in Washington where Jessica
had hoped to visit President Bill Clinton, whom she had invited
to take a spin in her plane.
</P>
<P>
"To visit you at the White House would be wonderful and clearly
to pilot an airplane that you would be in would bring me an even
greater joy," the girl wrote in a letter that had not drawn a
response.
</P>
<P>
It was her father who suggested the cross-country flight and
footed the 15, 000 dolar bill.

<HEADLINE> Asprilla Set for FA Showdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Faustino Asprilla and Keith Curle
will face the Football Association (FA) disciplinary committee on
April 30 over a series of bruising clashes watched by millions on
television.
</P>
<P>
Newcastle's controversial Colombian striker and the Manchester
City skipper were involved in a running battle during the
Premiership clash between the clubs on February 24.
</P>
<P>
Soon after half-time Asprilla, angered by being hauled back as
he tried to break into the City area, lashed out with his elbow,
catching Curle in the face.
</P>
<P>
The City player went down, although referee Martin Bodenham
took no action and the South American subsequently scored his
first goal in English football in what became a thrilling 3-3 draw.
</P>
<P>
But the controversy did not end there. After the final
whistle, the pair clashed again, just yards from a linesman, with
Asprilla appearing to butt Curle, the referee again taking no
action.
</P>
<P>
Both Newcastle boss Kevin Keegan and City manager Alan Ball
said they had not had a clear view of either incident but
television footage was graphic.
</P>
<P>
Within two hours of the match, the FA had launched an inquiry
and Asprilla was later charged with two counts of misconduct and
Curle one.
</P>
<P>
Whatever the outcome -- and history suggests a lengthy ban is
likely for Asprilla -- there is little chance that either player
will miss any games this season.
</P>
<P>
Relegation-haunted City play their final fixture at home to
Liverpool five days later, while the Magpies face two games that
week, at Nottingham Forest on May 2 then home to Spurs on May 5.
</P>
<P>
But both clubs have a 14-day right of appeal against any
punishments imposed by the hearing and should those be claimed it
would mean any suspensions would come into effect at the beginning
of next season.

<HEADLINE> Dow Recovers From Steep Retreat in Heavy Volume </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrials staged
a dramatic comeback Thursday, dropping 70 points on mounting fears
of inflation but gunning into positive territory late in the day
to close slightly higher.
</P>
<P>
The Dow average ended up 1.09 at 5,487.07, breaking a four-day
losing on end that took the blue-chip index down 204 points from
the record 5,689.74 set on April 3.
</P>
<P>
Falling stocks outpaced winners by 7 to 4. Big Board volume was
heavy at 519.65 million shares, well ahead of Wednesday's pace and
the sixth highest on record.
</P>
<P>
Broad-market indexes ended mostly lower. The NYSE's composite
index fell 1.55 to 339.38. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index
fell 2.30 to 631.20. The Nasdaq composite index fell 9.58 to
1,095.70. But the American Stock Exchange's market value index
rose 0.23 to 570.19.
</P>
<P>
The New York Stock Exchange twice imposed trading restrictions,
which are aimed at smoothing out sharp price swings.
</P>
<P>
The market's recent retreat has been fueled by worries that the
combination of a strengthening economy and rising commodities
prices will rekindle higher inflation, according to analysts. As a
result bond prices have been driven down and interest rates have
risen in credit markets.
</P>
<P>
But on Thursday, the 30-year Treasury bond began a rebound and
its yield dipped to 6.93 percent, slightly down from an
eight-month high of 6.94 percent late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The rise in commodity prices boosted some stocks, including
oil-related shares, but in general it weighed down the market.
</P>
<P>
But bank stocks fell sharply along with other
interest-sensitive stocks like brokerage and insurance companies,
and utilities.

LONDON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The London International Financial
Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe) today launched trading in the
euroyen contract, in an effort to strengthen the City's position
as the international centre of yen-denominated swaps and currency
business.
</P>
<P>
The contract, the second most popular money market future in
the world, is listed at the Tokyo international Financial Futures
Exchange (Tiffe) and is being traded in London as part of a link
agreement between the two exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times reported today that the euroyen contract is
fully "fungible", allowing dealers to transfer open positions
between the two exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Open interest in the euroyen contract, currently amounting to
1,216,000 contracts, is to be transferred back and forth between
Tokyo and London.
</P>
<P>
However, unlike the mutual offset system used in other
international link-ups, clearing will take place only in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Liffe began working three years ago on its link-up with the
Tiffe and signed an agreement last year.
</P>
<P>
Later this year, Liffe plans to begin limited floor trading in
the US T-Bond futures contract in London as part of a similar
alliance with the Chicago Board of Trade.

<HEADLINE> Clarke Urged to Rule out New ERM Re-entry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The British Chancellor of the
Exchequer Kenneth Clarke is under renewed pressure to rule out any
UK re-entry into a new European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) at
the coming European Union conference.
</P>
<P>
John Redwood, a senior Euro-sceptic Conservative and challenger
for Conservative leadership last summer, was reported as saying
that Clarke should "warn Europe that single European currency
project and a new ERM is destined to split the European Union
(EU)".
</P>
<P>
Clarke is due to fly to Verona, Italy, on Friday for a crucial
meeting of EU finance ministers to discuss the relationship
between those inside and outside the future single currency, Euro.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is likely to present Clarke with a difficult
battle, since Britain, quitting the European ERM in 1992, is
likely to be forced to rejoin a new ERM, which will be linked to
the currencies outside the Euro.
</P>
<P>
Some Conservative backbenchers have repeatedly warned that the
Chancellor would face pressure to resign if he make any
concessions to his EU counterparts on the issue.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister John Major has made it clear on several
occasions that Britain would not rejoin any form of a new ERM.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said that Clarke is expected to please the
Euro-sceptics by fighting pressure from other EU countries to
accommodate a new ERM.

NEW YORK, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Crude oil futures prices closed
at five-year highs, breaking the 25 U.S. dollar a barrel level
Thursday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, as United Nations

Gasoline futures also surged to five-year highs with
expectations for a strong summer driving season.
</P>

Light, sweet crude oil for May delivery rose 1.13 U.S. dollars

affected by the Gulf War, closed at 32 U.S. dollars a barrel.

<P>
May heating oil rose 1.51 cents to 64.02 cents a gallon. May
unleaded gasoline rose 1.31 cents to 74.30 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
After Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, Iraq was prohibited from
selling oil on world markets. The talks are over a U.N. offer to
allow Iraq to sell 1 billion U.S. dollar worth of oil every 90
days with some of the revenue from the sales to be used to buy
food and medicine for its people.

WASHINGTON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
dispatched the amphibious assault ship Guam and two other vessels
from the Adriatic toward waters off Liberia to help with the
evacuation of remaining Americans and foreign nationals from the
west African country, U.S. military sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the ships, making up part of an elite
Amphibious Ready Group, will arrive near the Liberian coast in an
about a week to provide means for a rapid evacuation if the
violence spins out of control.
</P>
<P>
Aboard the ships, a helicopter assault ship, an amphibious
assault carrier and an amphibious dock landing ship, are more than
1,000 American Marines.
</P>
<P>
There were some 470 U.S. citizens living in Liberia before
evacuations began on Tuesday night. Of those, 45 worked at the
U.S. Embassy in Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
Violence resumed Thursday throughout Monrovia for a sixth
consecutive day as rival gangs went on massive looting and
slaughtering spread in inter-ethnic fighting.
</P>
<P>
"It's just chaotic," said a U.N. official, summing up the
situation in Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
Frightened residents who have hidden in their homes since
fighting erupted in Monrovia Saturday complained that food and
water were running precariously short.
</P>
<P>
Many of the more than 300 remaining Americans in Liberia live
in pockets outside the capital of Monrovia and cannot get to the
U.S. embassy to be evacuated, a Pentagon official told reporters.

WASHINGTON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A freight train carrying
harmful chemicals derailed today in northwestern U.S., prompting
the evacuation of a small town near the site.
</P>
<P>
Officials said at least 37 people were taken to hospitals and
three were reportedly in critical condition after inhaling the
irritating gas leaked from the train's overturned tank car.
</P>
<P>
The train, operated by Montana Rail Link, jumped tracks at
about 4 a.m. local time near Alberton, Montana, a small town of
400 residents.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 1,000 people were evacuated from the area around
the derailment within four hours after the accident.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said the leaking tank car was ruptured on the
bottom and about 170,000 pound od chlorine had leaked.
</P>
<P>
The leakage closed an interstate highway that runs next to the
derailment site.
</P>
<P>
Chlorine is a greenish-yellow poisonous gas used in sterilizing

<P>
"There has been widespread looting, it's a fact that some
apartments have been looted and some vehicles have been stolen,"
said US Embassy spokesman Dudley Sims.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that looters had attacked a Lebanese school
next to the US Embassy and were using vehicles fom the UN
Military Observer Mission in Liberia to carry off their spoils.
</P>
<P>
"Everything is running out -- water, food and fuel," said one
resident.
</P>
<P>
The commander of the West African Peace-keeping Force known as
ECOMOG, General John Inienger, was quoted today by a report as
saying that his men were tryig to take control of the city to
prevent the spread of looting.
</P>

December 1989, capital Monrovia had been relatively quiet until
fighting eupted nearly a week ago after the Liberian interim
goverment tried to arrest militia warlord Roosvelt Johnson on
murder charges.

signed by Liberia's all parties in the Nigerian capital Abuja
last August.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG commander Inienger said that the peace-keepers
intercepted bands of armed guerrillas trying to infiltrate the
capital from western Liberia to back up colleagues locked in
fighting.
</P>
<P>
About 30 ECOMOG soldiers were stilll held by Johnson's
backers, along with other hostages, the commander added.

<HEADLINE> FMs of Yugoslavia, Canada Discuss Bilateral Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Foreign Minister Milan
Milutinovic and his Canadian counterpart Lloyd Axworth discussed
bilateral cooperation and Bosnian situation here today.
</P>
<P>
A Yugoslav Foreign Ministry statement said the talks marked a
resumption of dialogues between the two countries, and made
contribution to a better mutual understanding and an all-round
promotion of relations and cooperation between Yugoslavia and
Canada.
</P>
<P>
Axworth arrived in Belgrade Wednesday for a two-day official
visit to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the two sides agreed to have more talks on
inter-state agreements in all domains of bilateral cooperation, as
diplomatic relations between the two countries is expected to be
upgraded to the ambassadorial level.
</P>
<P>
Both sides showed strong interest in renewing concrete forms of
economic-financial cooperation, and the first step along those
lines is to be the renewal of commercial flights between the two
countries, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Following the talks, Milutinovic told reporters that apart from
bilateral cooperation, they also discussed important issues in
Bosnia, which include fair and free elections, the equal treatment
to the two political entities in the country, reconstruction and
the return of refugees.
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic said that it was of primary importance to secure
equal treatment of the Muslim-Croat federation and the Republika
Srpska, the two entities in Bosnia, especially with respect to
financial and other aid for the program of reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic received
Axworth today in Belgrade and both sides expressed the conviction
that Yugoslavia and Canada would continue to promote the bilateral
relations, Tanjug news agency said.

<HEADLINE> Science and Public Administration Create Miracle,  UN reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Integration of science and
public administration created a miracle -- no one was killed in
the whole county of Qinglong during the Great Tangshan Earthquake
20 years ago, according to a U.N. report.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake of magnitude 7.8 at the Richter scale, which
occurred on July 28, 1976, destroyed Tangshan city in north China
and claimed 240,000 lives and wounded 600,000 others seriously.
All the surrounding counties, except Qinglong, reported hundreds
of deaths, Professor Wang Chengmin of Chinese State Seismological
Bureau told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The report, drafted by Jeanne-Marie Col and Jean J. Chu of the
U.N. Department of Development Support and Management Services,
noted Professor Wang explained to local officials the abnormal
signals for the Tangshan region relating to a possible earthquake
on July 16, nearly two weeks before the catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
After learning the information, leaders of Qinglong County
organized both professional monitoring groups and lay detection
persons to watch and collect signals day and night, disseminated
knowledge about earthquake among local people, advised local
people to be clear of high buildings and power lines, and
mobilized local officials, village chiefs, teachers, high school
students and youth to help people move out their houses to live in
plastic sheet-roofed sheds.
</P>
<P>
As a result, no one was killed though more than 180,000
buildings were destroyed, including 7,000 totally collapsed, in
Qinglong County, which is 115 kilometers from the county seat to
Tangshan, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Department for Development Support and Management
Services, citing the example of Qinglong County, said that it was
good public administration which could methodically respond and
and organize the population while there was a special urgency in
the situation.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. department noted a key linkage was between early
warning and community preparation.
</P>
<P>
"Although early warning is often the purview of the scientific
community, the Global Program seeks to encourage communication
between scientists and administrators, these administrators and
their communities, and the empowering of these communities to
monitor para-professionally in order to assess risk locally and to
provide immediate warnings," the U.N. department said in its
global program for the integration of public administration and
the science of disasters.
</P>
<P>
The global program would begin its activities in a few selected
countries, such as China, where the 1996 Interregional Technical
meeting would be held in its Tangshan city in coming July, the
U.N. department said.
</P>
<P>
The participation in monitoring by students in primary and
secondary schools and other groups would lead not only to disaster
reduction but also to empowerment of community residents to take
responsibility for the well-being of their community, the U.N.
department added.

<HEADLINE> No Rise in Death Rates Among Cellular Phone Users </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Early studies on cellular
telephone users show no evidence of an increase in death rates,
according to the New York Times today.
</P>
<P>
Comparing the 1994 death rates of users of small, one-piece
cellular telephones with those of people who used other types of
portable phones showed no increased overall mortality
attributed to the technology.
</P>
<P>
Investigators said that they used industry and government
records to identify 250,000 people who used either cordless
cellular phones with antennas held near the ear or other mobile
phones, mostly car phones, where these sources of microwave
exposure are located far from the head.
</P>
<P>
The studies found that the 1994 mortality rate of cellular
phone users was 86 percent that of users of mobile car phones. And
the mortality rates of both groups were lower than corresponding
rates for the general population, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
Concerns about the safety of cellular phones surfaced three
years ago because several people believed that their brain
tumors had been caused by the devices.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa To Contribute 16 Million Rand To UNCTAD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(By Ye Xingzeng, Liu Yegang)
</P>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 11 (Xinhua) -- South Africa would
contribute 16 million Rand (about 4.16 million US Dollars) to the
forthcoming ninth session of the United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development (UNCTAD).
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed today by South African Trade and Industry
Minister Alec Erwin at a press conference at Midrand near
Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD IX, scheduled to be opened here by President Nelson
Mandela on April 27, will be attended by more than 2,700 people,
including ministerial level representatives from UNCTAD's 188
member states.
</P>
<P>
Erwin said the theme of the conference would be focused on the
promotion of growth and sustainable development in a globalizing
and liberalizing world economy.
</P>
<P>
Problems to be discussed at the gathering will be similar
to those South Africa has been grappling with for years,
according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
At the same press conference, Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz
Pahad said hosting the UNCTAD IX was again an important signal
that South Africa had completely been admitted to the
international community.
</P>
<P>
Pahad said the country was hosting the conference because it
had a major role in "reversing the so-called African fatigue
mentality".
</P>
<P>
"Africa is the only continent in the world expected to become
poorer in the next ten years, and we are looking for solutions to
turn around the general decline in Africa's economy," added
Pahad.

<HEADLINE> Long-term Mortgage Rates in U.S. Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-year fixed-rate
mortgages in the U.S. topped 8 percent this week, the first time
in 10 months, according to a national survey released today by the
U.S. Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
</P>
<P>
Rates averaged 8.05 percent, up from 7.78 percent last week and
the highest since they averaged 8.27 percent during the week ended
on May 4, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages had dropped to a two-year low
of 6.94 percent last October before they started a gradual rise.
</P>
<P>
On one-year adjustable rate mortgages, lenders were asking an
average initial rate of 5.80 percent, up from 5.62 percent last
week.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for those refinancing
mortgages, averaged 7.56 percent this week, up from 7.29 percent a
week earlier.
</P>
<P>
The increase of long-term mortgage rates, particularly the
thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages is shadowing the U.S. housing
industry. The Mortgage Bankers Association reported today that
mortgage applications during the week ended on April 5 dropped by
18 percent from the previous week. It was the third decline in
five weeks.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Vows to Strike Northern Israel in Retaliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A top leader of the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Party of God, vowed here this evening that his party
would strike back by "bombarding northern Israel" to
retaliate the air raids Israel launched on Beirut's south
suburbs and other areas.
</P>
<P>
"We will respond to the aggressions that took place today, and
we will bombard (Jewish) settlements in northern Palestine,"
Secretary General of the Shiite Hezbollah Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah
told a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
"This is our decision and they (the Israelis) should wait
for the response," the Hezbollah leader announced.
</P>
<P>
Israeli forces launched a series of air raids, from the dawn
to the late afternoon today, killing five people and wounding 15,
according to preliminary statistics of Red Cross sources.
</P>
<P>
In his remarks, Nasrallah alluded to the Hezbollah's refusal
to amend a U.S.-mediated understanding which put an end to an
Israeli blitz in south Lebanon in July 1993, and under the tacit
understanding Israel promised to refrain from attacking civilian
targets in south Lebanon in exchange for a Hezbollah guarantee for
the security of the northern Israeli settlements.
</P>
<P>
Nasrallah said that "the Zionist enemy wanted to impose a new
equilibrium" through today's agressions.
</P>
<P>
"We are the winner as regards the problem of security for
civilians in Lebanon and security for civilians in the (Jewish)
settlements," he said, "but the problem of aggression against the
suburbs (of Beirut) is another problem, and we never accept an
interlock between the two problems."
</P>
<P>
According to the radio of the Israeli client militia in south
Lebanon, an Israeli senior officer in the south claimed earlier
today that there would be no stability in Beirut as long as a
tranquility in the Jewish settlements of Kyriat Shmona and
Nahariyah in northern Israel is not guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
Coordinator of the Israeli activities in south Lebanon Ori
Lubrani said that the Israeli army would strike the terrorists
in any places.
</P>
<P>
Nasrallah stressed that the only way to guarantee the security
for the Jewish settlers "is not to touch our civilians."
</P>
<P>
"And any touch of our civilians will be met by a touch
of the colonies and civilians in northern Palestine and there
will be no safety for the settlements in northern Palestine,"
Nasrallah stressed.

<HEADLINE> Kwazulu/Natal Poll Date Has To Be Reconsidered: Mandela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The postponement of the
local government elections in Kwazulu/Natal Province scheduled
for May 29 has to be reconsidered, President Nelson Mandela said
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at his official Pretoria residence,
Mandela said he would meet Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader
Mangosuthu Buthelezi on a final decision about the election in Cape
Town on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Mandela was briefed by Provincial Affairs and
Constitutional Development Minister Chris Fismer and his deputy
Valli Moosa on the situation in Kwazulu/Natal.
</P>
<P>
The president said later he had accepted their recommendation
on the need for further consultations within the government on
the date of the local poll in the strife-torn province.
</P>
<P>
All interested parties in Kwazulu/Natal should sit down and
decide what to do, added Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Citing a report of about the killings of 90 people in
Kwazulu/Natal over the weekend, the president said: "That is too
much, and the prediction is that more people are going to die as
the rhetoric of political organizations intensifies as the
elections come near."
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the political violence in Kwazulu/Natal
between the supporters of the African National Congress and the
IFP has claimed the lives of more than 20,000 in the province
since the mid-1980s.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Guerrillas Fire More Katyusha Rockets into northern Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Guerrillas of the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Party of God, fired more Katyusha rockets into
northern Israel tonight, in retaliation for a series of Israeli
air raids today at various targets in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of Hezbollah,
announced that it bombarded from 6:20 to 6:50 p.m. local time
(15:20 to 15:50 GMT), with Katyusha rockets in three batches,
five Jewish settlements in northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Syrian army spokesman announced that one Syrian
soldier was killed and seven others were wounded in an air raid
carried out by Israeli warplanes at Ramlet Al-Ali neighborhood in
Beirut's southern suburbs in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
At 3:00 p.m. (12:00 GMT), six Israeli helicopters carried out
an air raid at the southern suburbs of Beirut. Security sources
reported that the Israeli helicopters fired nine air-to-surface
missiles at positions of the Lebanese army and Syrian troops,
hitting a Syrian army post.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes were continuing launching air raids tonight
at targets in south Lebanon and west Beqaa.
</P>
<P>
Latest reports from the south said that Israeli warplanes
launched tonight three successive air raids at the south Lebanese
village of Legryieh.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli warplanes also intensively attacked the
Lebanese villages of Ein Tini, Mashkhara and Sahmor in Western
Beqaa around 9:25 p.m. (18:25 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The Israeli occupation forces were also continuing shelling a
number of villages in those areas.
</P>
<P>
Israeli jet fighters and helicopters have been carrying out
reconnaissance flights over south Lebanon, especially over Iglim
At-Toffah and the Litani river basin, areas actively used by
Moslem guerrillas to launch attacks at Israeli occupation forces,
as well as the south Lebanese port cities of Sour and Saida.
</P>
<P>
Israeli planes soared in the sky over the lebanese capital from
time to time, drawing anti-aircraft fires opened by the Lebanese
army units and Syrian troops stationed on hills around Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the Israeli-occupied enclave in south Lebanon
said that the Israeli army was sending reinforcement to the border
strip by bringing in more heavy artilleries and armored vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen people were killed and some 35 others wounded in the
Israeli air raids and bombardments in south Lebanon since early
hours this morning, according to the latest statistics published
by Red Cross sources.
</P>
<P>
Five people, including a Lebanese army sergeant, were killed
and some 15 others were injured in the Israeli air raids at
Beirut's southern outskirts and other areas Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al Hariri pointed out today that
what was happening would not weaken Hezbollah, but would
strengthen it, and would result in more killings and woundings of
civilians, and destroying villages and dispelling their residents.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the solution was to stop the fighting, and to
negotiate for an Israeli withdrawal form the south and western
Beqaa.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the U.S. Cable News Network, CNN, the
Lebanese prime minister said Hezbollah has "some political
orientations which we do not agree with, and its political
programs are different from ours, and the party has some members
in the parliament who are opposed to my government."
</P>
<P>
"But what Israel is doing does not constitutes a solution for
the situation," he underlined.
</P>
<P>
Calling for a peaceful life, the Lebanese prime minister said,
"Lebanon is a small country, and Israel is stronger than Lebanon.
We know that and we recognize that and we can't and do not want
to destroy Israel."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the solution exists in an Israeli
withdrawal. With this withdrawal, Hezbollah will not have any
legitimate ground to fight, he emphasized.

BELGRADE, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations deplored the
absence of Bosnian Serbs from the Bosnia reconstruction conference
in Brussels, a U.N. spokeswoman said here today.
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman for the U.N. office in Belgrade Susan Manuel told a

conference might cause trouble in the recovery and welfare of the
Serb people, who have already suffered enough.

Srpska needs 1.4 billion U.S. dollars for reconstruction, Manuel
added.
</P>
<P>
Republika Srpska Prime minister Rajko Kasagic sent a letter
Thursday to the international community that representatives of
the Bosnian Serb entity could not attend the donors conference on
Friday and Saturday as members of a "delegation of Bosnia,"
because under the Dayton peace agreement, "no joint Bosnian bodies
existed until the elections."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Retail Sales Rise Slightly in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Commerce Department
reported today that retail sales were nearly stagnant in March,
rising just 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said that sales totaled 203 billion
dollars in March, up from 202.9 billion in February.
</P>
<P>
The department also revised the February increase of
retail sales from originally estimated 0.8 percent to 1.9
percent. It was the best performance in nearly three years.
</P>
<P>
Sales of durable goods, those expected to last more than three
years, were unchanged in March after a 3 percent increase in
February.
</P>
<P>
Sales by automotive dealers, which account for about a quarter
of all retail spending, dropped 0.5 percent after spurting upward
by 4.4 percent in the previous month. February's increase was the
largest since 5.6 percent in February 1991.
</P>
<P>
Nondurable goods sales increased by 0.2 percent following a 1.1
percent gain in February.
</P>
<P>
Total retail sales were 5.2 percent higher than in March 1995.
</P>
<P>
The government figures came one day after many major retail
chains reported vigorous sales in March. Those reports were read
as an indication the economy was about to break out of its
sluggish growth pattern.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Prices Shoot Up in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Consumer prices in U.S. shot
up by 0.4 percent in March, the second steep gain in three months,
the U.S. Labor Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The 0.4 percent increase in March was also one of the
largest since a 0.7 percent jump in October 1990. For the year so
far, inflation at the consumer level in the country has been
rising at an annual rate of 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department said the increase in its Consumer Price
Index (CPI) matched the advance in January when energy costs
skyrocketed because of the severe cold of the month.
</P>
<P>
Consumer prices advanced by 0.4 percent in last January
followed by a just 0.2 percent gain in February when temperatures
moderated.
</P>
<P>
Energy costs jumped 1.4 percent in March, the biggest advance
since a 1.9 percent gain in January. It was the fourth straight
gain after they were declining throughout most of 1995.
</P>
<P>
But other components shared in the CPI increase, including a
0.6 percent surge in food prices, largest since a 0.8 percent jump
in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the
so-called core rate of inflation was up 0.3 percent, matching the
January increase.
</P>
<P>
The CPI rose just 2.5 percent in 1995, the fourth year in a row
it remained below 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The department reported on April 11 that wholesale prices in
U.S. shot up 0.5 percent in March, the biggest increase in three
months. That also was driven by a huge jump in winter-related
energy costs.
