<HEADLINE> Alfalfa Sprouts, Salmonella Linked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Alfalfa sprouts, used as a garnish on everything  
from salads to hamburgers, sickened an estimated 20,000 people in 
the United States in two salmonella outbreaks in 1995, researchers 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers ``should consider this danger when deciding whether to  
eat alfalfa sprouts,'' said the researchers led by Dr. Chris Van 
Beneden, an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention 
</P>
<P>
	Although new methods to prevent salmonella poisoning are being  
tried, the researchers said they may not be adequate. Their work 
was reported in today's Journal of the American Medical 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Salmonella is a strain of bacteria found in animal feces. It  
generally causes nausea but can be fatal in older people, infants 
and those with weak immune systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Tainted alfalfa sprout seeds caused a 1995 outbreak in the  
Northwest and another one that same year from Georgia to Vermont, 
the researchers said. They said the same seeds sickened an 
undetermined number of people in Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
	Although only about 700 salmonella cases were reported, the  
researchers estimated more than 20,000 people in the United States 
alone were sickened since only a fraction of cases are usually 
reported. No one died. 
</P>
<P>
	The seeds were traced to a seed broker in the Netherlands. The  
researchers suspect the seeds were tainted either in the field by 
animal feces or wastewater, or by an infected worker at a 
seed-packaging plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfalfa sprouts were first implicated as a source of illness in  
1973, but their image as a health food may have spared them the 
scrutiny given more widely recognized sources for salmonella like 
meat, chicken and eggs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because it was a health food, it wasn't as highly  
suspicious,'' Van Beneden said. Also, sprouts were not as popular 
25 years ago as they are now. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of the International Sprout Growers Association  
acknowledged the salmonella scare has hurt the industry but said 
the findings predate new methods for safeguarding seeds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The old techniques just didn't work, but the new ones will,''  
said association president Nancy Snider, who owns a sprout farm in 
Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	The outbreaks forced a number of growers out of business. Since  
then, Snider said, some growers have begun using a chlorination 
process approved last fall by the Environmental Protection Agency 
to decontaminate seeds.

<HEADLINE> Sugar Cane Harvest Faces Down Year / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) -- This year's harvest is not looking  
too sweet for the state's $50 million sugar cane industry, the 
Texas Agricultural Extension Service reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Bob Wiedenfield, Texas Agricultural Experiment Station  
agronomist in Weslaco, said harvest is behind and yield is down 
considerably, resulting in a $10 million loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had three dry years in a row,'' he said. ``You can't  
make a good sugar crop without a good water supply.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wiedenfield said in a normal season the yield is 33 tons of cane  
per acre, but this year yield is down to 29 tons per acre. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman Rozeff, agronomist with the Rio Grande Valley Sugar  
Growers Inc. in Santa Rosa, said the water levels along the Rio 
Grande River haven't changed much despite the large amount of rain 
the Valley received this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fall rains came at the worst possible time,'' he said.  
``We normally begin harvesting in the second week of September, but 
harvest was delayed until the end of November.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rozeff said sugar quality is very low due to those untimely  
rains. He said the cane was dry throughout the summer, and the 
moisture in September caused the cane to start growing vegetatively 
again instead of building sugar. 
</P>
<P>
	``Usually, we have about 10 percent sugar content in the cane,''  
he said. ``This year we only have 7 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fall rains also prevented planting of sugar cane for next  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We only have 2,800 acres planted for next year,'' Rozeff said.  
``That's low compared to the usual 6,000 to 10,000 acres.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sugar cane's growing season is 12 months long and sugar cane  
requires more water than most crops grown in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	Rozeff said the cane needs 43 inches of rainfall and irrigation  
during the growing season. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a normal year, we have 24 inches of rain and the other 19  
inches comes from irrigation,'' he said. ``Of course we didn't have 
nearly that much rain this year and four of the water districts ran 
out of water in early July, so we had some cane sitting dry for two 
months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the first eight months of the year being the driest on  
record, Rozeff doesn't expect to see many sugar cane producers 
switching to other crops. 
</P>
<P>
	``Farmers don't have a lot of options down here,'' he said.  
``Once you invest so much capital into a certain commodity, it's 
not easy to change.'' 
</P>
<P>

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Killer bees have colonized most of Los  
Angeles County, according to the county's agricultural chief. 
</P>
<P>
	The area colonized by Africanized honey bees covers 1,010 square  
miles, including 76 cities and 23 unincorporated areas, with the 
entire county to be declared colonized by the end of the year, said 
Cato Fiksdal, chief of the state Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``The declaration of colonization does not really change  
anything but puts the county residents and agencies on a higher 
level of alert regarding the presence of the bees,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first known colony in the county was found in December in a  
Lawndale apartment building, about 16 miles southeast of downtown 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Five people are known to have died from killer bee stings  
nationwide, the last in April 1997 when a 72-year-old man was 
attacked at his mobile home in Casa Grande, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 34,000 square miles across California have been  
colonized with killer bees, including all of Imperial, Riverside 
and San Bernardino counties and parts of San Diego County.

<HEADLINE>  Botha Knows What's Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Francois Botha knows what's expected of him.  
</P>
<P>
	He's supposed to be the legitimate victim for Mike Tyson in  
Tyson's first fight since he bit Evander Holyfield's ears on June 
28, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't want another Peter McNeeley,'' said Shelley Finkel,  
Tyson's boxing adviser. ``Botha is credible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNeeley didn't get through the first round in Tyson's first  
fight after his release from prison in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Botha also is relatively unknown despite a 39-1 record and a  
brief stay as the IBF heavyweight champion. He is well aware this 
fight can bring the kind of recognition that has escaped him in a 
pro career that began in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a huge fight,'' said the 30-year-old South African,  
who has lived in the United States for nine years. ``I believe that 
they bit off more than they could chew with Francois Botha. No pun 
intended.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson was an 8-1 favorite.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a sore loser,'' Botha said Tuesday. ``I've got a great  
chin and I'm ready to fight. I can't be intimidated. I won't be 
intimidated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Botha won the IBF crown on a unanimous decision over Axel Schulz  
of Germany on Dec. 9, 1995. However, he tested positive for steroid 
use. At first, the IBF ordered a rematch but then withdrew 
championship recognition. 
</P>
<P>
	``They found a trace of a steroid,'' Botha said. ``The steroid  
was in medication a doctor had given me for a right-arm injury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Botha called the loss of the title ``devastating.''  
</P>
<P>
	``We had a contract to fight Mike Tyson four years ago,'' he  
said. ``I lost a lot of money then and the opportunity to prove 
what I'm trying to prove now. I had to start all over again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the time he was stripped of the title, Botha was promoted by  
Don King, as was Tyson. Neither is now. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Moorer won the vacant title on points against Schulz. On  
Nov. 9, 1996 in Las Vegas, Moorer defended the title against Botha 
and stopped him in the 12th round. 
</P>
<P>
	Botha admits he fought poorly that night. That plus the fact he  
has fought less then two full rounds (two first-round knockouts) in 
19 months probably accounts for why he was selected to fight Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
	Botha had a successful amateur career in South Africa before  
turning pro in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	After winning his first two fights in South Africa, Botha came  
to the United States, and most of his fights have been in this 
country. The first was a four-round decision over Joe Adams in 1990 
at Biloxi, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I first came to the United States I really had to  
struggle,'' Botha recalled. ``I has $1,200 in my pocket.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His purse for Saturday's fight is $1.94 million.  
</P>
<P>
	Botha lives at Newport Beach, Calif., with his wife Elsje and  
their son Marcel and daughter Cecilia. He is the process of 
becoming a U.S. citizen.

	Clinton Aide Blasts GOP Filing  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's spokesman today dismissed  
the House Republicans' brief for the impeachment trial as an 
overblown account that ``reads like a cheap mystery.'' The White 
House will offer its own next installment tomorrow, he said. 
Clinton spokesman Joe Lockhart focused today on what he called the 
House's ``constantly shifting'' of its version of the charges and 
its reliance on ``hyperbole and overblown rhetoric.'' Republicans 
in their brief said that if Clinton is not convicted of the perjury 
and obstruction-of-justice charges, ``the bar will be so high that 
only a convicted felon or a traitor will need to be concerned.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Quayle Bashes Clinton on Issues  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Vice President Dan Quayle, a likely GOP  
presidential candidate, said today that national security should be 
a major issue in the 2000 campaign and offered a critical 
assessment of President Clinton's foreign policy. Quayle said the 
Clinton administration ``frittered away'' opportunities left by his 
boss, former President Bush. He asserted that Clinton has stumbled 
with regard to policies in China, Cuba, Iraq, North Korea and 
Russia, on terrorism and strategic defense initiatives and in his 
duties to support troops and defense technology. 

</P>
<P>
	Kosovo Rebels To Free 8 Yugoslavs  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Ethnic Albanian rebels have agreed  
to release all eight Yugoslav soldiers they have been holding 
hostage since their convoy strayed into rebel-held territory in 
Kosovo four days ago, an international official said today. 
Officials feared Serb forces would resume their military crackdown 
against ethnic Albanian separatists -- largely halted since they 
agreed to a truce in October -- if the soldiers weren't freed. 

</P>
<P>
	U.S. Imposes Sanctions on Russians  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States imposed economic sanctions  
today against a Moscow university and two other Russian 
institutions, accusing them of leaking nuclear and missile 
technology to Iran. No details of the sanctions were given. A 
similar action was taken against seven other Russian institutions 
in July. The sanctions were announced at a nonproliferation 
conference at which National Security Adviser Sandy Berger pledged 
an all-out effort to gain Senate ratification of the Comprehensive 
Test Ban Treaty. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Aides Oppose Spy Clemency  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Several of President Clinton's top national  
security aides are steering him away from granting clemency to 
Jonathan Pollard, the former Navy intelligence official who spied 
for Israel in the 1980s and is now serving a life sentence. 
Administration officials speaking privately said it was possible 
Clinton would wait weeks or even months before deciding the matter. 
Those urging Pollard's early release argue that his admitted acts 
of providing U.S. secrets to Israel did no real damage to American 
national security. 

</P>
<P>
	Iraq Plans To Raise Oil Output  
</P>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- As oil-producing countries try to cut  
excess global production, Iraq today announced plans to raise its 
output. Iraq hopes to boost production to 3 million barrels per day 
from the current 2.5 million barrels, and to 3.5 million barrels 
within two years. The Oil Ministry's director-general of planning 
said the increase was contingent upon receiving spare parts for the 
country's ailing oil industry, battered by more than eight years of 
U.N. trade sanctions.

	Ala. Care Center Fire Kills 3 Kids  
</P>
<P>
	MOBILE, Ala. (AP) -- Fire blamed on a badly vented dryer swept  
through an unlicensed home day care center, killing three children. 
Four other children were hospitalized along with the center's 
operator, who was credited with saving three children before she 
collapsed. The dead children ranged in age from infancy to 5 years. 
A Fire Department spokesman said today the fire apparently started 
in an electric clothes dryer that was vented to the outside and may 
have allowed lint to accumulate on heating coils.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Just before 2 p.m. EST, the Dow industrials were  
down 123.32 to 9,496.57. Declining issues on the New York Stock 
Exchange led advancers 2,037-883. The Nasdaq was down 59.34 to 
2,325.25.

	Bulls Plot Course Without Jordan  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago Bulls, knowing they are about to lose  
one of the best players in NBA history, are plotting their 
post-Michael Jordan course. The Bulls have only four players under 
contract, and star Scottie Pippen is one of the more sought-after 
free agents. They could become major players in the free-agent 
market, targeting a forward like Antonio McDyess, or could re-sign 
Pippen and trade him, possibly to the Lakers. The Bulls and Jordan 
scheduled a news conference for noon EST tomorrow.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- John Travolta, Robin Williams and Tom Hanks  
battled a weekend of freezing temperatures along the East coast to 
lure chilled moviegoers back into theaters. 
</P>
<P>
	Travolta's crusade against tainted drinking water in ``A Civil  
Action,'' earned the top spot with $15.2 million in its first 
weekend in wide release. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' ``Patch Adams,'' in which he stars as a medical  
student healing with humor, was knocked to second place with $12.7

Boston and Philadelphia and, to a lesser extent, Chicago, on Friday 
night, then rebounded Saturday. January is usually slow because 
people head back to work and school after the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare in Love'' added screens and business, taking in  
$4.2 million for eighth place with a jump of 26 percent. It's

<HEADLINE> Sweepstakes Settlement Call for $3M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- A telemarketer will pay $3 million to  
settle allegations that it engaged in deceptive practices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission and 30 state attorneys general had  
complained that Direct American Marketers Inc., now in bankruptcy 
reorganization, sent sweepstakes mailers to consumers urging them 
to claim prizes by phone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our lawsuit claimed that consumers spent between $20 and $40  
on these 900 number calls, only to learn that they had won a $1 
prize or nothing at all,'' Pennsylvania Attorney General Mike 
Fisher said. ``The defendants, however, grossed millions of dollars 
from the pay-per-call charges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His state will get $145,000 of the settlement, to cover  
investigation costs and provide some restitutiion to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement, announced Monday, was recently approved by a  
bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
	Direct American sweepstakes mailings also were sent to consumers  
under the names ACG Independent Judging Organization, Audit Control 
Bureau and Equity Disbursement Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Direct American stopped mailing the prize solicitations in  
August 1997 and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy court 
reorganization.

<HEADLINE>  Redskins Sold for $800 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- On a somber day at Redskin Park, John Kent  
Cooke met with his employees one by one. There wasn't much he could 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	Now a lame duck president, Cooke knows he will be out of a job  
when the new owners -- the $800 million owners -- take over the 
Washington Redskins in a few weeks. As for everyone else in the 
building, who knows? 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a sad day for me and my family and our Redskins  
family,'' Cooke said in a statement. ``I had the desire and the 
will -- even the ingenuity -- but not enough money to keep the 
Redskins in my family. ... In the end, my family could not pay the 
price of our success, and others could in these affluent times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pending NFL approval, New York real estate and banking scions  
Howard Milstein and Edward Milstein and D.C.-area communications 
executive Daniel Snyder will be the new bosses of the burgundy and 
gold after topping Cooke and several other prospective buyers to 
win the most expensive bidding war in American professional sports 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale -- for the team, Jack Kent Cooke Stadium and Redskin  
Park -- was formally announced Monday, but the successful trio 
didn't want to discuss their plans for the franchise until the deal 
is officially closed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're now focusing on the NFL approval process,'' said Howard  
Milstein, adding that he will have his own one-on-one meetings with 
each employee once the handover takes place. ``At the moment, the 
trustees are still the owner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That leaves everybody hanging, including general manager Charley  
Casserly and coach Norv Turner. Both must continue their usual 
duties -- scouting, preparing for free agency -- without knowing if 
the new regime will keep them. The Redskins haven't been to the 
playoffs since 1992, so changes wouldn't be unexpected if the NFL 
approval happens quickly enough for a new coach and GM to be hired 
before the free agency period begins Feb. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hoping to expedite this process,'' Howard Milstein said.  
``But the NFL has its procedures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sale price sets a dauntingly high benchmark for future sales  
of NFL teams. It could take two decades before the investment 
breaks even, although the timetable could be speeded up if, as 
expected, the new owners add more luxury suites to the stadium and 
rename the 80,116-seat facility in a multimillion-dollar deal with 
a corporate sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you buy a sports team, you're dealing with something that  
you do for the love of the sport first,'' said Howard Milstein, who 
will be listed as majority owner even though the three men say they 
are equal partners. ``The business considerations have to be 
second.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sale of the Redskins was the big surprise found in the will  
after Jack Kent Cooke died in April 1997 at 84. Instead of leaving 
the team to his son, the elder Cooke instructed that the seven 
trustees of his estate sell the team and stadium and that the 
proceeds be used to establish a charitable foundation for children. 
</P>
<P>
	As it stands, 90 percent -- $720 million -- of the sale price will  
go to the foundation. John Kent Cooke gets the other 10 percent, 
the portion of the team he owned when his father died. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Cooke family was seen as the old guard, the  
Milstein-Snyder trio is definitely young blood. Howard Milstein is 
47. Edward Milstein is 41. Snyder is just 34. 
</P>
<P>
	The Milstein brothers, who say they learned from their failed  
effort to land the expansion Cleveland Browns last year, will 
continue to live in New York. Howard Milstein will have to sell his 
stake in the NHL's New York Islanders to comply with NFL 
cross-ownership rules, although it's uncertain whether his brother 
will have to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder is the local connection and a lifelong Redskins fan. The  
three men say one of their first priorities will be to hire someone 
to oversee day-to-day affairs at Redskin Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a lifelong dream,'' Snyder said. ``As good as it  
gets.''

<HEADLINE> Robby Gordon Forms Own CART Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Driver Robby Gordon said he's formed his own  
Indy-car team and will compete on the CART circuit. John Menard, a 
car owner in the rival Indy Racing League, will be a partner in the 
new Team Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
	Menard will continue to run his IRL operation with Greg Ray as  
the primary driver. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the beginning of something very special, something  
I've wanted to do all my career,'' said Gordon, who has two 
victories among 86 starts in his seven-year racing career. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be very tough to do, but I believe we've  
assembled a great group of guys. This is something we talked about 
last year in October. ... We built the facility a year ago to 
eventually have an Indy-car team based here,'' Gordon said from the 
team headquarters in Anaheim, Calif. ``The shop is all together, 
all the equipment that any CART team has today, I think.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, 30, had a brief try in NASCAR's Winston Cup series with  
Team Sabco in 1997, then drove for Arciero-Wells and finished 23rd 
in the CART standings last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon hired Laurie Gerrish, who previously worked for such  
teams as Penske and Walker Racing, as team manager. Dave Forbes, 
who worked with Gordon in 1997, will be crew chief. 
</P>
<P>
	The team will drive Swift chassis powered by Toyota engines.  
</P>
<P>
	Menard, who won the 1997 IRL championship with driver Tony  
Stewart, said there would be no problem being involved in race 
teams in rival series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Between Robby and (partner) Mike Held, they're going to run  
the CART team. I'll continue to spend my time with the IRL team,'' 
Menard said. ``I think it's going to work just fine. There are 
things we'll learn from one another that will be beneficial to both 
teams.''

<HEADLINE> 2 Take Pleas To Avoid Gotti Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- A 66-year-old man accepted a plea  
bargain Tuesday in his hospital bed and his son accepted one in 
court, further winnowing the list of John A. ``Junior'' Gotti's 
co-defendants. 
</P>
<P>
	The guilty pleas were the fourth and fifth this week and leave  
just six defendants -- there were originally 23 -- for a trial likely 
to begin in March or April. The number could get smaller still, 
allowing prosecutors to focus their energies on Gotti, who has 
refused a plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Gotti, son of imprisoned-for-life don John J.  
Gotti, ran the Gambino crime family. He is charged with 
racketeering, extortion and fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregory DePalma, ill with lung cancer at the Westchester Medical  
Center in Valhalla, told federal Magistrate Judge Mark Fox that he 
was guilty of gambling, extortion, labor racketeering and tax 
crimes. Prosecutors agreed to a prison sentence between 10 and 13 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	DePalma was not required to admit membership in the Gambino  
family, where prosecutors say he was a longtime soldier, and he 
will not be cooperating with prosecutors, defense lawyer John 
Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
	But DePalma is likely to be a star of the case against Gotti  
anyway, on telephone recordings made by federal agents. 
</P>
<P>
	DePalma's son, Craig DePalma, 32, appeared in federal court  
later Tuesday and confessed to racketeering, extortion, loan 
sharking, bribery, labor racketeering, gambling and tax violations. 
Prosecutors recommended a sentence of six-and-a-half to eight years 
and did not require DePalma's cooperation or any admission of Mafia 
membership.

<HEADLINE> Neb. Quakers Want Stay of Execution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Audrey Lamm was 2 years old the night her  
pregnant mother and Janet Mesner were stabbed to death in a Quaker 
meeting house. She would now like to save the killer's life. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lamm, now 20, and Quakers across the country have joined in  
a bid to save convicted killer Randolph Reeves from being executed 
in Nebraska's electric chair Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We deserve a hearing!'' shouted Audrey Lamm, weeping and  
holding pictures of the victims during during a break in Monday's 
Board of Pardons hearing on the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-member board rejected the pleas and unanimously voted  
against commuting the death sentence. Reeves still has an appeal 
pending before the Nebraska Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves, an American Indian adopted by a white Quaker family, was  
convicted in 1981 of killing Janet Mesner. Prosecutors say he 
killed witness Victoria Lamm, a friend of Mesner's, to conceal his 
identity. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves, who was drunk and had taken drugs on the night of the  
murders, has said he does not remember the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is of particular interest to Quakers, who are  
fundamentally opposed to the death penalty. Reeves and Mesner were 
both raised in the faith, known as the Religious Society of 
Friends, and Reeves and Mesner were also friends, with common 
relatives in their families. 
</P>
<P>
	``This case hits much closer to home than perhaps others have,''  
said Steve Gulick, a Quaker in Philadelphia who pushed his meeting 
house and others nationwide to pass resolutions opposing Reeves' 
electrocution. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mesner and Reeves families have attended the same Quaker  
meeting house in Central City for decades, and Mesner's mother, 
Mildred, was Reeves' Sunday school teacher. 
</P>
<P>
	She quietly held hands with her husband, Kenneth, as they stood  
before the parole board Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just never did have a feeling of vengeance,'' Kenneth  
Mesner said. ``It didn't occur to us. They grieve with us and we 
are grieving with them now.''

<HEADLINE> Yahoo! Earnings Exceed Projections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Yahoo! Inc. earned $18.5 million in the  
fourth quarter, reversing a loss from the same period last year and 
beating Wall Street expectations handily as its revenue nearly 
tripled. 
</P>
<P>
	The news could add new fuel to Wall Street's Internet stock  
buying frenzy, which took a breather Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The popular Internet site operator reported Tuesday its earnings  
equaled 16 cents per share for the quarter ended Dec. 31. The 
results compared to a loss of $1.9 million, or 2 cents per share, 
in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue soared to $76.4 million from $26.6 million as increasing  
visitors to its Web sites helped fuel advertising. The company's 
sites include a range of features from chat rooms to news and 
search services. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding costs related to acquisitions, Yahoo! earned $25  
million, or 21 cents per share -- easily beating the official 
analysts' estimate of 16 cents per share, according to First Call 
Corp. The results also topped the 20-cent ``whisper'' number -- the 
rumored predictions that circulate prior to earnings announcements. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were released after stock markets closed. Earlier,  
Yahoo! stock dropped $13.37 1/2 a share to $402 as investors sold 
shares to lock in profits, but analysts expected the price to 
resume its recent climb Wednesday. In after-hours trading late 
Tuesday, Yahoo! soared more than 40 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least they're making some money,'' said Jim Balderston,  
director of Zona Research Inc., an Internet market research company 
in Redwood City, Calif. ``Some of these Internet stocks have been 
going through the roof while continuing to pile up negative 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on what the market has been doing, this is an  
encouragement not just for Yahoo! but for a lot of Internet 
stocks,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, Yahoo! announced that Tim Koogle, president and  
chief executive officer, was appointed chairman and CEO, effective 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Mallett, the company's chief operating officer, was  
elevated to the president's post and made a board member, in 
addition to his current title. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also announced a 2-for-1 stock split, which had been  
expected by analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, Yahoo! earned $25.6 million, or 23 cents per  
share, reversing a loss of $25.5 million, or 29 cents per share, in 
1997. Revenue jumped to $203.3 million from $70.5 million.

<HEADLINE> Maier Comes Back To Win Giant Slalom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ADELBODEN, Switzerland (AP) -- Olympic champion Hermann Maier of  
Austria overtook rookie teammate Benjamin Raich on the final run 
Tuesday and won a World Cup giant slalom. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier, a double gold medal winner at the '98 Nagano Games, was  
.16 seconds after the first run, and then delivered a risk-taking 
second run down the perilous Kuonisbergli course and won his sixth 
race of the season with a combined time of 2 minutes. 12.66 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	After losing to Raich last week in Flachau, where the  
``Herminator'' had learned to ski, Maier joked that ``the new 
generation of skiers had no respect for the old.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Maier was back on top with his sixth win .  
</P>
<P>
	``Winning here was important for me but I was not skiing against  
Benjamin,'' Maier said after winning here for the second straight 
year. ``There is no real rivalry between Benjamin and me, and 
Flachau did not come between us. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I was bent on beating the Swiss,'' he added after his 17th  
career win. ``It's tough to defeat them on home snow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The victory marks Maier's first in a giant slalom since the  
season opener in Solden, Austria in October, and solidifies his 
place atop the overall World Cup rankings, Maier is first with 911 
points, 228 ahead of his Kjetil Andre Aamodt of Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	A painful back could threaten the Austrian's lead, however.  
</P>
<P>
	Forced to take painkillers before the first run, Maier said his  
condition would determine whether or not he would race in the 
double downhill in Wengen, Switzerland, this weekend and on home 
snow in Kitzbuehel next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Climbing the podium for the first time this season in a giant  
slalom, Aamodt placed second in 2:12.94, ahead of Raich. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had so many top-10 finishes this season but no podiums in  
the giant slalom,'' said Aamodt. ``To be so close to Maier was 
important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his first year on the World Cup circuit, Raich stunned fans  
and racers alike last week, winning a giant slalom in Flachau, 
Austria, on Monday, and a night slalom in Schladming, Austria, 
three days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-time world junior champion appeared poised for a third  
consecutive victory Tuesday, when he posted the fastest time in the 
opening run on one of the World Cup circuit's oldest and most 
demanding courses. 
</P>
<P>
	But youth proved no match for experience in the second leg as  
the 20-year-old saw his .16 advantage trickle away, and victory 
replaced by a third-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't succumb to psychological pressure and I'm not  
disappointed,'' insisted Raich, who finished .82 back. ``I'm used 
to such situations from the Europa Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just made a big mistake at the top of the course which cost  
me a lot of time. I'm happy that didn't drop me off the podium 
altogether.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sweden's Fredrik Nyberg placed fourth in 2:13.51, ahead of  
Austria's Andreas Schifferer, 1.21 back. 
</P>
<P>
	World Cup giant slalom leader Michael Von Gruenigen was the top  
Swiss skier, finishing sixth in 2:13.96. The result was sufficient 
to maintain his lead atop the giant slalom rankings, where he sits 
with 323. 
</P>
<P>
	American Bode Miller recorded one of the day's most impressive  
runs to place a career best eighth place. 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting 18th after the opening leg, Miller posted the fastest  
second run -- .01 quicker than Maier -- to rise 10 places, and finish 
ahead of Austria's Stephan Eberharter.

	SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- The economy of Shanghai, China's business  
capital, grew by 10.1 percent in 1998, helped by massive spending

<HEADLINE> Hubbell Seeks Indictment Dismissal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Presidential friend Webster Hubbell says the  
latest criminal charges against him are ``tainted'' by documents he 
turned over to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 31-page filing in U.S. District Court this week, Hubbell  
seeks dismissal of allegations that he concealed his and Hillary 
Rodham Clinton's roles in a failed Arkansas land development. 
Federal regulators say the Castle Grande project south of Little 
Rock involved ``insider dealing, fictitious sales and land flips.'' 
It was owned by the Clintons' former Whitewater business partner, 
Jim McDougal, and Hubbell's father-in-law, Seth Ward. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell's lawyers say six of the 15 felony charges against him  
are invalid because of a four-year-old plea bargain agreement in 
which Hubbell admitted defrauding his former law firm and its 
clients of at least $394,000. Hubbell's lawyers say the action in 
1994 means he cannot be charged again. He is accused of fraud, 
false statements and corruptly impeding the functions of two 
federal regulatory agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Hubbell's lawyers, Starr himself ``strongly  
suggested'' that the decision to bring the case ``was influenced'' 
by information received from the documents Hubbell supplied to 
prosecutors under a grant of immunity in November 1996. Those 
documents ``tainted'' Starr's decision to bring the case, Hubbell's 
lawyers stated. The records detail $700,000 in payments to Hubbell, 
much of it from friends of President Clinton in 1994 when Hubbell 
was under investigation by Starr's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell's lawyers raised the possibility of seeking an  
evidentiary hearing to focus on how prosecutors assembled the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Relying on the same argument about the documents, Hubbell last  
year won dismissal of a separate tax evasion case brought by 
Starr's office. Starr is appealing that dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, where Hubbell and Mrs. Clinton  
were partners, performed work in 1985 and 1986 on Castle Grande for 
Madison Guaranty, a failing savings and loan owned by Jim and Susan 
McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's work on Castle Grande came to light in January  
1996 when her long-sought billing records turned up in the White 
House under circumstances that have never been explained. Her 
records had been subpoenaed by Whitewater prosecutors in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Raising additional arguments for dismissal of the charges,  
Hubbell's lawyers wrote that a ``two-year delay'' in obtaining the 
grand jury indictment ``has impermissibly prejudiced'' his defense. 
</P>
<P>
	By September 1996, Starr's office ``had the fruits of its own  
investigation'' and ``no criminal charges were brought,'' said 
Hubbell's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the interim, James McDougal died and Seth Ward has become  
unavailable as a witness,'' Hubbell's court papers stated. ``This 
is particularly unfortunate for Mr. Hubbell's defense, because we 
know to a certainty that Ward had testimony to give that, if 
believed, would have completely exonerated Mr. Hubbell on several 
charges and been very helpful to him on the rest.''

<HEADLINE> Intel Profits Up 18 Pct. in Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Strong demand for Intel Corp.'s pricier computer  
chips helped push up fourth-quarter profits 18 percent, easily 
beating Wall Street expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the world's largest maker of computer chips cautioned  
Tuesday that revenue in the current quarter should drop from 
fourth-quarter levels due to a seasonal slump in sales of personal 
computers that typically follows the holiday buying season. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the results suggested a mixed outlook for the  
computer industry, which looks to the largest maker of computer 
chips as a broader barometer of high-tech demand. Intel's 
microprocessors are used as the brains in about 85 percent of the 
world's personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel earned $2.06 billion, or $1.19 a share on a diluted basis,  
in the three months ended Dec. 26, 1998. That was up from a profit 
of $1.74 billion, or 98 cents a diluted share, in the year-ago 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose 17 percent to a record $7.61 billion from $6.51  
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Intel profit handily surpassed Wall Street forecasts for a  
profit of $1.07 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., tied the profit gain to  
cost-cutting and strong sales of its chips, particularly its more 
profitable Xeon microprocessors used as the brainpower in desktop 
machines bought by businesses. A shift in Intel's sales mix toward 
the expensive processors more than offset damage to Intel's bottom 
line by sharp price cuts in its Celeron chips, which are used in 
inexpensive PCs costing $1,000 and less, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason was that Intel's sales of less profitable Celeron  
chips fell below expectations in the fourth quarter, Intel 
executive vice president Paul Otellini said in a teleconference 
with analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	While Intel is by far the dominant microprocessor maker, the  
company responded late to stiff competition from rivals AMD and 
National Semiconductor's Cyrix in supplying chips for the 
increasingly popular sub-$1,000 PCs. Now starting to retake market 
share in that market segment, Intel has been forced to sharply cut 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe we had taken our eye off the ball in 1998,''  
Otellini said. ``The products we launched into the channel helped 
us retake share back to our historic level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intel said its improved profitability should continue this year,  
with gross margins -- what it makes after subtracting certain 
expenses -- continuing to beat levels set earlier last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the good news,'' said Andrew Peck, an analyst with  
Cowen &AMP; Co., a Boston-based investment bank. ``The only source of 
disappointment is the company is clearly girding for a typical 
season decline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, Intel earned $6.07 billion, or $3.45 a diluted  
share, down from a profit of $6.95 billion, or $3.87 a diluted 
share. Revenues rose to $26.27 billion from $25.07 billion.

	GOP Links Flynt to White House  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans suggested Tuesday that the White  
House may be involved in Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt's 
efforts to brand Georgia Rep. Bob Barr as a hypocrite for his past 
personal conduct. Flynt released a Jan. 8 affidavit from Barr's 
former wife in which she says she believes he was having an affair 
in the mid-1980s with a woman who is now his present wife. ``If 
that's the best he can do, the White House ought to get another 
agent,'' said Rep. John Linder, R-Ga., a former chairman of the 
National Republican Campaign Committee.

</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The second presidential impeachment trial in  
the nation's history should not take place without a photo record, 
news photographers say in urging the Senate to make an exception to 
its rule banning photographers from the Senate floor. The 
congressional Standing Committee of Press Photographers on Tuesday 
asked news executives to urge Senate leaders to change the rules. 
The committee also sent out letters to all 100 senators and 
appealed to the Rules Committee.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will ask for $2 billion over  
five years to help tens of thousands of disabled Americans return 
to work by making it easier for them to keep their health 
insurance, and providing tax credits and better rehabilitation 
services. The announcement will cap years of effort by the 
disability community and members of Congress to encourage people 
with disabilities to go to work.

	McGwire's 70th Sells for $3 Million  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mark McGwire's 70th home run ball sold at  
auction Tuesday night for more than $3 million by an anonymous 
telephone bidder. The amount is well above November's record price 
of $126,500 for a ball that Babe Ruth hit for the first home run in 
Yankee Stadium. ``$3 million is an extraordinary accomplishment. 
It's 23 times the world record for any baseball ever sold, and five 
to six times the record of any sports artifact,'' said Arlen 
Ettinger, president of Guernsey's auction house, which held the 
special sale at Madison Square Garden.

	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Police arrested a Reno construction worker  
Tuesday and planned to charge two Marines in California as well in 
the slaughter of 34 wild horses shot to death in Nevada with 
high-powered rifles. Anthony Jon Merlino, 21 was arrested and 
charged with grand larceny, grand theft and maiming, poisoning or 
killing another person's animal, police said. Arrest warrants on

member, will form an exploratory committee with the Federal 
Election Commission on Wednesday, allowing him to raise and spend

probably would come in the spring.

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Michael Jordan, the greatest player in NBA

source with close ties to the league. If so, it would be his second 
retirement in five years, perhaps for good this time. The Chicago

No. 6 Kentucky on Tuesday night, the Volunteers' first win at Rupp 
Arena in 20 years. As the horn sounded, with Kentucky's Michael 
Bradley struggling to get a shot off from under the basket, 
Volunteer players rushed the floor, celebrating their first win 
over the Wildcats since 1993 and first at Kentucky in a generation.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Teammates Await Word </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Michael Jordan's teammates want to hear  
it from him. 
</P>
<P>
	They'll believe he is retiring from the Chicago Bulls and  
basketball only after he arrives at the United Center on Wednesday 
-- impeccably dressed, no doubt -- faces a mob of reporters and tells 
the world: 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm outta here.''  
</P>
<P>
	The greatest player in NBA history is expected to do precisely  
that at noon EST, according to a source with close ties to the 
league. If so, it would be his second retirement in five years, 
perhaps for good this time. 
</P>
<P>
	Until then, it was pretty much business as usual at Berto  
Center, except for the caravan of TV trucks and the media army that 
swarmed the place. With the lockout over and the season start-up 
less than a month away, several of Jordan's teammates showed up to 
work out, choose up sides and scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
	Some, like Steve Kerr, wouldn't say good-bye until Jordan did.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to get into my soliloquy about Michael Jordan  
until I hear it's official,'' said Kerr, who stayed long after most 
had left to work on his jump shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to hear it from the man himself,'' center Luc Longley  
said. ``Until I hear from M.J. -- and I haven't -- I'll wait and 
see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not Derrick Watt. The 32-year-old Bulls fan was quick to say  
what he thought Jordan's expected departure would mean for the city 
and team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Losers! Losers! Losers!'' he said as he left Jordan's downtown  
restaurant. ``Without Michael, they'll be in the basement of their 
division.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe. But one thing's for sure: The team will never be the same  
without Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	B.J. Armstrong, now with Charlotte but who played on three Bulls  
title teams, had mixed emotions about the retirement reports. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a way to go out as an athlete and that's the way to go  
out,'' said Armstrong, a good friend of Jordan's. 
</P>
<P>
	``He went out on top, he made the last shot, he made all the  
right plays. He's had a fabulous career and everything you could 
ever ask as an athlete he's done. He had a chance to leave and this 
was the chance. '' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Tribune quoted a source as saying Jordan met with a  
few teammates at his home Monday, including Ron Harper and Scottie 
Pippen, and told them the thought of playing an abbreviated, 
50-game season wasn't enough of a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	If that's the case and he retires, Jordan's fans' last image of  
their hero at his best will undoubtedly be his sensational, 
last-second shot that won Game 6 in Utah. That thriller gave the 
Bulls their sixth championship of the 90's. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decision is that you're walking away from something where  
you're the best, not like he's one of the best, he's the best,'' 
Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's doing it his way. There's a part of me that is sad but a  
part of me that is happy to see him go out on top.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He would also be going out as a five-time league MVP, 10-time  
league scoring championship -- and one month (Feb. 17) shy of his 
36th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Jerry Krause, who openly feuded with Jordan, had  
no comment as he pulled his car into the snowy parking lot at the 
practice center. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach-in-waiting Tim Floyd wasn't saying much, either. He rolled  
his car window down and said: ``I don't think it would be 
appropriate for me to say anything at this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In case everyone has forgotten, for a long time Jordan loudly  
proclaimed he had no intention of playing for any coach but Phil 
Jackson, who left the team after June's championship and has 
declined several invitations to return. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's Dream Team teammate and TV commercial sidekick Larry  
Bird, who retired and then returned as coach of the Indiana Pacers, 
jokingly suggested the NBA hadn't seen the last of His Airness: 
</P>
<P>
	``There comes a time in every player's career that they have to  
make that decision and he feels it's his time. We want to wish he 
and his family well and we look forward to seeing him sometime in 
late March when he makes his return again in Market Square Arena.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's where Jordan made his comeback nearly four years ago.  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan retired from the Bulls the first time in October 1993,  
saying he had accomplished everything he wanted to in basketball 
and planned to devote more time to his family. Instead, he spent 
1994 playing minor league baseball for the Double-A Birmingham 
Barons, a farm team of the Chicago White Sox. He left baseball in 
the spring of 1995 and returned to the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	John Bach, an assistant coach on three of the Bulls'  
championship teams, praised Jordan for not only his skill, but for 
the joy he brought to the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He never looked like he'd been sentenced by a judge to play  
basketball,'' Bach said. ``I've seen too many athletes not go out 
at the right time. They stay and struggle and lose some of the 
dignity they are entitled to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appalachian State coach Buzz Peterson called his former North  
Carolina roommate and put the question to him directly. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's going on? I've got 25 pink slip phone messages here in  
front of me,'' Peterson said. ``He just laughed and said 
everything's coming out now and everything's being said.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like the close friend that he is, Peterson declined to say what  
Jordan would announce on Wednesday. But he added: 
</P>
<P>
	``He's just run out of things to prove and he loves those kids.  
Whenever I talk to him, he just can't stop talking about Marcus and 
Jeffrey and Jasmine,'' Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Marcus and Jeffrey are playing basketball now and he could  
tell you how many points they scored and how many assists they had 
and what the final score was of every one of their games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson recalled how Jordan once predicted just how famous he  
would become. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he won the Naismith and the Wooden Award in 1984 he came  
back and said to me, `They're going to name a shoe after me.' And I 
said, `Now, come on, Michael. They make shoes for Larry Bird and 
Magic Johnson. What makes you think they're going to name a shoe 
after you?' 
</P>
<P>
	``And he said, `I'm telling you. It's time to buy some stock in  
Nike.'''

<HEADLINE> Individuals Fuel Web Stock Frenzy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Online investors -- empowered by easy clicks,  
tiny trading costs and passionate feelings about the World Wide 
Web's potential for everything -- are helping to fuel an Internet 
stock rally that many professionals consider perilous. 
</P>
<P>
	Mutual funds and other big investors, which are usually  
responsible for driving the stock market, have largely shunned the 
buying frenzy. They are worried that stocks that have doubled and 
tripled in weeks, or even days, may fall just as quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	This phenomenon is particularly important to understand as  
Internet companies begin reporting their fourth-quarter financial 
performance this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo!, the popular Internet site and Web search engine,  
impressed Wall Street with a strong report late Tuesday, but it's 
unclear whether lesser-known players will be able to justify their 
high-flying stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Most don't even have profits, and will only need to show higher  
sales or even declining losses in order to spark even more buying 
of their shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the slightest disappointment could cause a major reversal.  
</P>
<P>
	One of the chief reasons why individual investors are venturing  
into waters that the professionals are avoiding is that the 
Internet itself has made it so easy for people to move in and out 
of stocks every day. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have firms advertising that they can set up people as day  
traders. Give them `X' amount of money, and they'll give you the 
software and the machinery,'' said Barry Berman, head trader at 
Robert W. Baird, a Milwaukee-based investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Most eye-catching in this high-stakes game have been the daily  
moonshots fueled by Internet-related announcements from online 
newcomers and older companies trying to reinvent themselves. Last 
November, for instance, book store operator Books-A-Million 
announced the revamping of its Web site and saw its shares triple 
in one day. 
</P>
<P>
	On any given day, and for no apparent reason, an industry  
``veteran'' such as Yahoo! can soar 20 percent from levels that 
already represent a 1,000 percent gain in less than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Since professional money managers must report their performance  
to clients once a month, they have a strong incentive to stick with 
companies that have more dependable profits and stable share 
prices. Surprisingly, the investors who do seem willing to take 
chances are those with far less experience and much shallower 
pockets. 
</P>
<P>
	``In general, you don't see institutions paying the kind of  
(prices) you've got on those kinds of stocks,'' said Berman. He 
noted that a large amount of trading in Internet-related companies 
is being conducted in 200- or 300-share blocks rather than the 
thousands often bought and sold in each trade by major portfolio 
managers. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the few mutual funds that bill themselves as cyber-minded  
rarely stray beyond the big names like AOL and Yahoo! 
</P>
<P>
	The Robertson Stephens Information Age Fund, which normally  
devotes about 65 percent of its portfolio to the information 
technology industry, counted America Online, Amazon.com and Yahoo! 
among its top ten holdings at the end of September. 
</P>
<P>
	But those three stocks accounted for only about 13 percent of  
the fund's holdings, while about a third of its assets were tied up 
in plain old hardware and software giants such as Intel, Microsoft 
and Compaq Computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Naturally, since mutual funds don't need to disclose all their  
day-to-day dealings, it's likely that many are trading in some of 
the more speculative issues. But the Internet stock runup has been 
too frantic, analysts say, to be solely the work of institutional 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	``There can't be that many sophisticated traders out there. Even  
sophisticated traders are avoiding this group because it's a very 
irrational thing that's going on,'' said Ricky Harrington, 
technical analyst at Interstate/Johnson Lane in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way Internet stocks are trading is extremely risky even  
for most sophisticated trader and dynamite for those who are not,'' 
said Harrington, asserting that investors can't possibly expect to 
catch every winning stock or sector.

<HEADLINE>  Bulls May Lose More Than Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Get Michael Jordan back in a Chicago  
Bulls uniform, and the rest of the gang gladly tags along for 
another championship ride. Take him away, and running with the 
Bulls loses some of its luster. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that Jordan is retiring, Chicago is free to say, ``thanks,  
but no thanks'' to the players it really didn't want. (Hear that 
Dennis Rodman?) And free agents who are courted by other teams 
won't feel the same loyalty they once might have. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Michael retires, it certainly would change how the team is  
planning to rebuild and how the team is going to approach me,'' 
free-agent center Luc Longley said Tuesday. ``And it's going to 
affect my decision as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan was expected to announce his retirement today at the  
United Center, with Bulls chairman Jerry Reinsdorf and NBA 
commissioner David Stern flying in for the news conference. The 
Bulls made sure this was Jordan's day, as Reinsdorf, general 
manager Jerry Krause and coach-in-waiting Tim Floyd all declined 
comment until today. 
</P>
<P>
	Once Jordan leaves the podium, though, let the dismantling of  
the dynasty begin. The Bulls have 10 free agents, most in the 
league, from last year's team that won a sixth championship in the 
1990s. Of the four players under contract -- Ron Harper, Toni Kukoc, 
Randy Brown and Keith Booth -- Harper is the only starter. 
</P>
<P>
	Krause said Monday that if Jordan did indeed retire, his first  
choice is to re-sign players like Scottie Pippen, Steve Kerr and 
Longley, and make some moves in a free-agent market that includes 
Antonio McDyess, Damon Stoudamire, Jerry Stackhouse and Rod 
Strickland. But that's going to take money, something Chicago 
doesn't have a lot of right now. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls could sign Pippen and trade him, getting three or four  
players for $10 million instead of just one. Or they could dump 
Pippen, Rodman and the rest of the free agents and put all those 
millions toward a youth movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure they're going to try to make it work for the best for  
the Chicago Bulls and to try to compete for another championship,'' 
free agent Dickey Simpkins said. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Krause is already working the telephones to try and  
line up new players. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want us to come in for a visit,'' James Bryant, the agent  
for McDyess, said Tuesday. ``We've talked with them, and right now 
Antonio is interested in looking at all the options. He'll consider 
all factors, but their interest is coming late.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just because the Bulls call, however, doesn't mean they'll get  
the player. It's one thing to play with Jordan, Pippen and Rodman. 
It's another to play for a rookie coach on a team with an uncertain 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	``It opens up options for everybody, including the team and all  
the players,'' Kerr said. ``If this is what's happening, it's 
probably why he's doing it. So he can give the Bulls and the 
players their leeway that they need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kerr said he has no idea what his future holds. The fan favorite  
likes Chicago and wants to stay, but he doesn't know if the Bulls 
will have room for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can draw your own conclusions as far as where I'd fit in  
there. I'd probably fit into plan B and maybe not into plan C,'' he 
said. ``I've been prepared for this for a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The guy who stands to lose the most from Jordan's retirement is  
Rodman. The temperamental and oft-tattooed rebounder made $8 
million last year, but his antics wore thin during the NBA Finals 
and it's unlikely the Bulls will bring him back without Jordan to 
keep him in line. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't do me any good to speculate right now,'' Dwight  
Manley, Rodman's agent, said Tuesday. ``The next thing I have to do 
is talk to Jerry Krause. ... I owe it to them at least to talk to 
them first.''

<HEADLINE>  Bulls May Lose More Than Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Get Michael Jordan back in a Chicago  
Bulls uniform, and the rest of the gang gladly tags along for 
another championship ride. Take him away, and running with the 
Bulls loses some of its luster. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that Jordan is retiring, Chicago is free to say, ``thanks,  
but no thanks'' to the players it really didn't want. (Hear that 
Dennis Rodman?) And free agents who are courted by other teams 
won't feel the same loyalty they once might have. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Michael retires, it certainly would change how the team is  
planning to rebuild and how the team is going to approach me,'' 
free-agent center Luc Longley said Tuesday. ``And it's going to 
affect my decision as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan was expected to announce his retirement today at the  
United Center, with Bulls chairman Jerry Reinsdorf and NBA 
commissioner David Stern flying in for the news conference. The 
Bulls made sure this was Jordan's day, as Reinsdorf, general 
manager Jerry Krause and coach-in-waiting Tim Floyd all declined 
comment until today. 
</P>
<P>
	Once Jordan leaves the podium, though, let the dismantling of  
the dynasty begin. The Bulls have 10 free agents, most in the 
league, from last year's team that won a sixth championship in the 
1990s. Of the four players under contract -- Ron Harper, Toni Kukoc, 
Randy Brown and Keith Booth -- Harper is the only starter. 
</P>
<P>
	Krause said Monday that if Jordan did indeed retire, his first  
choice is to re-sign players like Scottie Pippen, Steve Kerr and 
Longley, and make some moves in a free-agent market that includes 
Antonio McDyess, Damon Stoudamire, Jerry Stackhouse and Rod 
Strickland. But that's going to take money, something Chicago 
doesn't have a lot of right now. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls could sign Pippen and trade him, getting three or four  
players for $10 million instead of just one. Or they could dump 
Pippen, Rodman and the rest of the free agents and put all those 
millions toward a youth movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure they're going to try to make it work for the best for  
the Chicago Bulls and to try to compete for another championship,'' 
free agent Dickey Simpkins said. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Krause is already working the telephones to try and  
line up new players. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want us to come in for a visit,'' James Bryant, the agent  
for McDyess, said Tuesday. ``We've talked with them, and right now 
Antonio is interested in looking at all the options. He'll consider 
all factors, but their interest is coming late.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just because the Bulls call, however, doesn't mean they'll get  
the player. It's one thing to play with Jordan, Pippen and Rodman. 
It's another to play for a rookie coach on a team with an uncertain 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	``It opens up options for everybody, including the team and all  
the players,'' Kerr said. ``If this is what's happening, it's 
probably why he's doing it. So he can give the Bulls and the 
players their leeway that they need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kerr said he has no idea what his future holds. The fan favorite  
likes Chicago and wants to stay, but he doesn't know if the Bulls 
will have room for him. 
</P>

	``You can draw your own conclusions as far as where I'd fit in  
there. I'd probably fit into plan B and maybe not into plan C,'' he

<HEADLINE> Barry Diller May Return To Movies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Media mogul Barry Diller reportedly wants  
back in the movie business. 
</P>
<P>
	Diller, 56, once the head of Paramount Pictures, has negotiated  
to buy at least a portion of October Films and PolyGram Filmed 
Entertainment, the Los Angeles Times and the Daily Variety trade 
paper reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The reports both cited unidentified sources, but disagreed on  
specifics. October Films and Diller's USA Networks Inc. refused 
comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Times, Diller was negotiating with Seagram  
Co.'s Universal Studios for its 51 percent stake in October Films, 
an art-house producer of the critically praised films ``Breaking 
the Waves'' and Robert Duvall's ``The Apostle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Daily Variety said the offer was for 100 percent of the  
company and that it expired Monday after minority shareholders 
failed to agree to terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Daily Variety, citing unidentified sources, said Diller offered  
$10 million to $15 million in stock of USA Networks, which owns 
Ticketmaster and the Home Shopping Network. 
</P>
<P>
	Diller reportedly also is trying to obtain some assets of  
PolyGram Filmed Entertainment from Seagram. A call seeking comment 
from Seagram representatives in New York was not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times said PolyGram is only willing to let go of its small  
television production operations that supply mostly cable 
programming -- Propaganda Films, Scott Free Productions and Gramercy 
Pictures. The deal would be worth up to $400 million, the sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Diller, who also helped create the Fox network under Rupert  
Murdoch, bought control of most of Universal's television assets 
from Seagram last year in exchange for 45 percent of his company. 
</P>
<P>
	Seagram acquired PolyGram last year for its huge music business,  
but sold most of its film library to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. and 
has suggested that other parts of the film business could be sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times said Diller also is chasing the Bravo and Independent  
Film channels, owned by Cablevision Systems Corp. Diller has a 
bargaining chip: USA Networks' biggest shareholder, Liberty Media 
Corp., owns an interest in Cablevision's programming arm.

<HEADLINE> Chiefs Keep Coach Search Wide Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The next coach of the Kansas City Chiefs  
could come from just about anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not looking necessarily for an offensive- or  
defensive-minded coach,'' president and general manager Carl 
Peterson said Tuesday. ``I'm not looking necessarily for a guy 
who's had NFL coaching experience. I'm not necessarily eliminating 
a college coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson said he hoped to name Marty Schottenheimer's successor  
before the Super Bowl on Jan. 31. Schottenheimer, after winning 101 
regular-season games in 10 years with the Chiefs, unexpectedly 
resigned on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We that are in the game of football should always be aware of  
the good coaches at all levels, the ascending coaches if you will. 
I have a list, I've had one for years,'' said Peterson, who hired 
Schottenheimer in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some very talented college coaches out there. I know  
they're very talented. I know they could be capable of leading the 
Kansas City Chiefs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three of Schottenheimer's assistants have formally applied --  
offensive coordinator Jimmy Raye, defensive coordinator Gunther 
Cunningham and assistant head coach Al Saunders. Dom Capers, who 
was fired last month by the Carolina Panthers, and former UCLA 
coach Terry Donahue are also thought to be on the short list 
because they have previous connections with Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
	Capers was an assistant coach with the Philadelphia Stars of the  
USFL in the early 1980s while Peterson was the president and 
general manager. Donahue and Peterson were assistants together at 
UCLA in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson refused to identify any potential candidates other than  
the three current staff members. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he planned to meet with the three again on Tuesday.  
Cunningham and Raye also have interviews with the Chicago Bears. 
Saunders was head coach of the San Diego Chargers for two years in 
the mid-80s. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I did with the three candidates from within our staff was  
give them a little criteria, some questions I wanted them to think 
about,'' Peterson said. ``I'm going to meet with them today and 
probably later in the week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said their knowledge of the players would not necessarily  
give them an advantage over any outside candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, a coach on a current staff has a better  
understanding of your player personnel a lot quicker than a coach 
coming in from the outside,'' he said. ``But you can stand too 
close to the trees to see the forest. There are plusses and minuses 
to both. That's why I want to pursue not only these three 
assistants from within our organization, but also pursue people 
from outside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schottenheimer's replacement will inherit a much better  
situation than the one he encountered in 1989. The Chiefs have led 
the NFL in home attendance for five straight years. Despite a 7-9 
record this past season, the Chiefs have made the playoffs seven 
times this decade and appear to possess the nucleus of a contender. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Kansas City Chiefs head coaching job is a prime job,''  
Peterson said. ``It's a great organization built on a great 
tradition. We expect to win here. We have, we think, the greatest 
fans in the National Football League. We have everything here 
that's necessary to win. I know there are an awful lot of people 
who would really like to come here.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Soars, Tokyo Stocks Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- In a wild day of trading, the dollar dipped, then  
soared against the yen today after Japan's central bank intervened 
in support of the dollar. Tokyo stocks closed slightly lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 112.50 yen in late afternoon trading, up 2.28  
yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also well above its late New York 
level of 108.93 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average drifted down 7.51  
points, or 0.06 percent, to close at 13,360.97. On Monday, the 
average closed down 23.33 points, or 0.17 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar sank as low as 108.65 yen in  
early trading but then rebounded sharply, rising as high as 112.85 
yen after the Bank of Japan intervened. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the central bank's first intervention in support of the  
dollar since February of 1996, the evening edition of the Nihon 
Keizai business daily reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan and the United States had conducted joint intervention  
last June, but that was to weaken the dollar, Kyodo News agency 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The move to intervene was triggered by growing anxiety over the  
yen's recent rally. 
</P>
<P>
	A stronger yen tends to make Japanese exports more expensive  
abroad and cuts into profits earned overseas. Lower earnings at 
exporters could hamper efforts to jump start Japan's recession 
plagued economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan's action came after Finance Minister Kiichi  
Miyazawa expressed concern about the dollar's plunge to a 28-month 
low of 108.21 yen at one point overnight in New York trading. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am carefully watching moves in the yen in domestic and  
overseas markets,'' Miyazawa said. 
</P>
<P>
	That sparked speculation that intervention was imminent and  
immediately buoyed the dollar. The dollar continued to rise once 
the central bank's sell off of yen holdings became evident to 
market players, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow Jones Newswires quoted an unidentified Japanese financial  
source as saying the Bank of Japan spent the equivalent of less 
than $1 billion for the intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank does not comment on reports of intervention.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka, the  
government's top spokesman, hinted late today that more efforts to 
curb the yen's strength could be in the offing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Neither excessive yen strength nor yen weakness is good for  
the world economy,'' he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currency trading, the euro was quoted at 127.83 yen in  
Tokyo, up slightly from 127.81 yen late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices moved into positive  
territory midday, but then gave up those gains in late trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Some investors were sidelined by the uncertain direction of the  
dollar yen exchange rate, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone is watching the currency markets,'' said Kunihiro  
Hatae, general manager of the stock division at Tokyo Securities 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section lost 1.41 points, or 0.13 percent, to 1,055.93 
points. The TOPIX closed down 1.06 points, or 0.10 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	About 361 million shares changed hands on the first section of  
the Tokyo Stock Exchange, up from 304.30 million shares on Monday. 
Declining issues outnumbered advancers 716 to 390, with 169 issues 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
rose to 1.770 percent from 1.750 percent on Monday, pushing its 
price down to 100.24 yen from 100.40 yen.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes Open Spaces Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton proposed a $1 billion  
spending splurge Tuesday to protect unspoiled land and historic 
places. The fight in Congress will be over where and how the money 
will be spent. 
</P>
<P>
	Key Republican members of Congress embraced the idea of putting  
more money into land preservation, but made clear that they and the 
White House probably will disagree on what land should be 
protected. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton ``land legacy initiative'' calls for giving states a  
little more than half of the $1 billion, while devoting $442 
million on direct federal land purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	This year about $320 million was provided by Congress to buy  
land for preservation. 
</P>
<P>
	The new initiative will ``meet the conservation challenges of a  
new century,'' said Clinton in remarks to environmentalists at the 
National Arboretum. 
</P>
<P>
	``It represents the single largest annual investment in  
protecting our green and open spaces since Theodore Roosevelt set 
our nation on the path of conservation nearly a century ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the $1 billion will come from revenue from offshore oil  
drilling, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president had hardly finished speaking when Interior  
Secretary Bruce Babbitt made clear at a White House briefing that 
he already had a list of properties in mind. 
</P>
<P>
	A top priority, he said, was to buy 450,000 acres in the  
Southern California desert within and around the Mojave and Joshua 
Tree national parks. The land can be had for $100 an acre, a great 
bargain, said Babbitt. 
</P>
<P>
	Other priorities would be to buy thousands of acres of  
forestland in New England to keep it out of the hands of 
developers; patchwork parcels in the Florida Everglades; land on 
the Missouri River along the Lewis and Clark trail; lands within 
and near Civil War battlefields such as Gettysburg and Antietam. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's wish list, however, is likely to run into  
trouble in Congress, where lawmakers have their own ideas on how 
the money -- if it is appropriated -- should be spent. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration will ``assert its priorities,'' said Babbitt.  
But he conceded that members of Congress will come up with their 
own lists as well, foreshadowing another budget tussle. 
</P>
<P>
	``The focus ought to be on protecting what we have,'' said Sen.  
Craig Thomas, R-Wyo., chairman of the Environment subcommittee on 
parks. He called Babbitt's proposal to buy land in the Mojave ``a 
new adventure'' he would oppose. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Frank Murkowski welcomed the administration's move to  
provide more money to states for conservation but said the federal 
government shouldn't tell states how to use it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The administration assumes that adding more land to the  
federal estate is the foremost desire of local and state 
governments. It is not,'' said Murkowski. 
</P>
<P>
	So, while the administration will push its list of priorities,  
including expansion of the federal marine sanctuaries program and 
restoration of coral reefs, the lawmakers in Congress will push 
their own projects. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists, meanwhile, welcomed the high-profile  
attention being given to the issue of land preservation. After all, 
they said, Congress for years has severely shortchanged the pool of 
money for buying land for preservation, and that may change. 
</P>
<P>
	``Parks and other public lands have to fight for scraps from the  
federal budget every year,'' said Thomas Kiernan, president of the 
National Parks and Conservation Association, a private advocacy 
group for federal parks. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the debate, Babbitt says funding for land conservation  
and preserving America's natural heritage has widespread appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	As the president was announcing his new lands legacy initiative,  
the American Society of Architects released a poll the group had 
commissioned showing that nearly nine of every 10 Americans 
consider access to parks and high-quality outdoor spaces extremely 
or very important.

<HEADLINE> Steelers' Wolford To Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Pittsburgh Steelers coach Bill Cowher talked  
offensive lineman Will Wolford out of retirement once. He couldn't 
do it twice. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolford, who nearly quit before the 1998 season, has decided to  
retire after 13 seasons, leaving the Steelers with a significant 
hole at left tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	Justin Strzelczyk, who missed most of the season with a serious  
knee injury, will likely move again from right tackle to left 
tackle to replace Wolford. Another possibility is Chris Conrad, a 
1998 third-round draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolford moved from left guard to left tackle this season after  
10-year starting tackle John Jackson signed with San Diego as a 
free agent. Strzelczyk originally shifted from right tackle to left 
tackle when training camp began, but moved back to right tackle the 
week before the season began. 
</P>
<P>
	With no upper-echelon offensive linemen available as free  
agents, the Steelers probably won't try to sign a replacement for 
Wolford. 
</P>
<P>
	By deciding to retire, Wolford will bypass the final season of a  
contract worth $2.1 million in base salary. Because he has not yet 
retired officially, the Steelers listed him Tuesday as one of their 
five players available to the Cleveland Browns in next month's 
expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other players believed to be on the list are wide  
receiver Henry Bailey, tight end Mitch Lyons and safety Bo Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolford played in three Super Bowls in his seven seasons with  
the Buffalo Bills, then spent three seasons with the Indianapolis 
Colts before signing with the Steelers in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolford's final year in football was marked by two significant  
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	He injured his neck in a swimming pool accident last summer,  
causing him to temporarily consider retirement. Later, after moving 
from guard to tackle, he tore a chest muscle in the fourth game of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	He missed two of the next three games, then returned to start  
the final eight while wearing a protective harness that severely 
restricted his mobility. Cowher said he essentially played with one 
arm during the second half of the season.

<HEADLINE> IOC Chief Samaranch Urged To Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The leadership of the IOC, including president  
Juan Antonio Samaranch, should resign in the Salt Lake City bribery 
scandal, the only person ever to quit the committee in a corruption 
case said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Helmick, who resigned as an IOC member and president of  
the U.S. Olympic Committee in 1991 amid conflict-of-interest 
allegations, said Samaranch should take responsibility for the 
biggest ethics-violation case in Olympic history. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said the IOC president apparently had violated the  
committee's ethics code by accepting firearms from Salt Lake worth 
almost 10 times the $150 limit on gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	``He set the rule and he violated it,'' Helmick said in a  
telephone interview. ``You'd expect the president of the IOC to 
adhere to a higher standard. He should resign. The IOC's officers 
should resign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch and other International Olympic Committee leaders have  
said that the president's acceptance of the guns worth more than 
$1,000 from Browning Arms Co. on behalf of the Salt Lake bid and 
Olympic organizing committees was OK because he does not vote on 
where the Olympics are staged. They also said that visitors to 
Samaranch's office traditionally bring gifts out of protocol, with 
the items placed on display or warehoused. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been no evidence that Samaranch or any of the IOC's  
vice presidents or executive board members were involved in the 
rounds of lavish gifts, cash payments, college scholarships and 
other perks from the Salt Lake Olympic panels that are now the 
focus of four investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	But Helmick said that the IOC chief should follow the examples  
of Frank Joklik and Dave Johnson, who resigned as president and 
senior vice president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is right and proper for the leadership to do so, when an  
institution is so shaken,'' he said. ``There are plenty of 
precedents in private business. But instead of taking 
responsibility, the IOC is going to find scapegoats. `The problem 
is fixed.' That's like a bunch of kids. And it will not fix the 
problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said IOC members, now picked at Samaranch's whim and  
remaining on the committee until they turn 70, should be subject to 
term limits or periodic reelection, and that the committee's 
autocratic practices should be made more open and democratic. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have to recognize that's part of the deal that comes with  
the first-class air tickets and the caviar,'' Helmick said. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls for Samaranch to step down followed the resignations of  
Joklik and Johnson but drew little attention. The most notable of 
the critics was Ken Bullock, a member of the SLOC board but 
considered an outsider in the Olympic community. 
</P>
<P>
	Helmick, however, was a member of the club, reaching a seat on  
the IOC's executive board and the presidency of its most important 
national subsidiary before falling from grace. 
</P>
<P>
	He resigned from both the IOC and the USOC presidency after an  
inquiry headed by former deputy U.S. Attorney General Arthur Burns 
found Helmick ``repeatedly violated conflict-of-interest provisions 
of the USOC and created a perception that he was trafficking on his 
Olympic positions for the benefit of private clients.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burns' report never was formally adopted by the USOC or the IOC.  
</P>
<P>
	Helmick said he was proud his resignation had helped the USOC  
tighten its ethics rules, but he could see no impact on the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was my fault it got started but it was not my fault where  
it went,'' he said of his case. ``What really punishes me is that 
it did nothing to inspire the IOC.''

<HEADLINE> Goldman Sachs Shakes Up Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co.'s Jon Corzine stepped down  
as co-chief executive Monday, ceding his management role just weeks 
after the elite investment bank reported poor year-end performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Corzine, 52, who will keep the title of co-chairman, will focus  
on reviving plans to sell shares in Goldman Sachs to the public for 
the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Day-to-day control of the 130-year-old partnership will be  
divvied up among Henry Paulson Jr., who will be the sole CEO, and 
John Thain and John Thornton, who were named co-chief operating 
officers. Thain and Thornton are members of the company's executive 
committee. Thain was chief financial officer. Thornton was an 
executive in the firm's international operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Corzine ``is paying the price for screwing up the initial public  
offering,'' said Alan Bromberg, finance professor for Southern 
Methodist University in Texas. ``They withdrew it at the same time 
they were pushing some other initial public offerings that were 
rather controversial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Executives at Goldman Sachs were unavailable for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Goldman Sachs, which is Wall Street's last private partnership,  
delayed its planned stock offering of a 10 percent to 15 percent 
stake in September, just weeks after the U.S. markets tumbled and 
Russia defaulted on its debts. 
</P>
<P>
	Just about the same time, Goldman underwrote an initial offering  
of stock by Mutual of New York, an insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman Sachs also was among the 14 banks and brokerages that  
were forced to bail out Long Term Capital Management. The 
secretive, high-risk investment fund, based in Greenwich, Conn., 
lost $4 billion on complicated bond trades. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman Sach's own trading losses in the bond market were  
substantial. Corzine had built up the bond trading practice and had 
headed it prior to taking over the top spots. 
</P>
<P>
	Behind the scenes, Goldman's top executives knew their stock  
offering would have to wait until 1999 because the firm's 
fourth-quarter profits were evaporating fast. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, last month Goldman reported an 81 percent plunge in  
fourth-quarter net income to $107 million. For all of fiscal 1998, 
Goldman's profits fell 3 percent to $2.92 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In October, the firm rewarded 57 employees with personal stakes  
in the partnership in an attempt to prevent its key talent from 
defecting to other Wall Street firms amid the uncertainty of 
Goldman's plans to go public. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IPO is critical to Goldman's future, most importantly for  
its ability to settle some measure of internal strife,'' said 
Michael A. Flanagan, an analyst with Financial Service Analytics. 
``There's always been some inside who wanted to go public, and 
those that didn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates of a Goldman IPO argue that it will give the company a  
needed influx of capital to become a bigger player in the 
fast-consolidating global investment banking business. Many of 
today's biggest mergers and buyouts use stock as their main form of 
currency, an avenue unavailable to a private partnership. 
</P>
<P>
	A company statement did not say when Goldman might attempt its  
offering. The cable business news network CNBC reported that the 
IPO is expected by summer.

<HEADLINE> FBI Investigates Poll Firm Break-In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                       *Associate Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI is helping investigate a break-in at a  
prominent Democratic polling firm that is advising Israeli 
politician Ehud Barak, a candidate for prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Someone broke into the Capitol Hill offices of Greenberg Quinlan  
Research Inc. through a vent on the roof Monday night or Tuesday 
morning, said Sgt. Joe Gentile, a spokesman for the Metropolitan 
Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeremy Rosner, vice president of the firm, said it was hard to  
tell what was taken but ``it does appear our international work was 
targeted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are investigating the possibility that certain records were  
targeted,'' Gentile said. ``I will confirm that confidential 
records, materials and various items such as petty cash were 
taken.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gentile said police advised the FBI ``because of the sensitive  
nature of the case,'' and the bureau is ``going to help us gather 
and analyze evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted to make sure the evidence was collected as  
effectively as possible,'' FBI spokeswoman Susan Lloyd said. She 
said, however, that District of Columbia police would be leading 
the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley Greenberg, a partner in the firm, was recently hired by  
Barak, head of Israel's opposition Labor Party and a leading 
challenger to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. James Carville, 
President Clinton's former campaign manager, also is working on the 
Barak campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli elections are scheduled for May 17.  
</P>
<P>
	Barak's campaign team in Israel had no comment on the break-in.  
</P>
<P>
	Greenberg was a key pollster for Clinton during the 1992  
presidential campaign and served as a White House pollster until 
1994. He also has worked for South African President Nelson Mandela 
and British Prime Minister Tony Blair. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're taking precautions and we're mindful of what happened,''  
said Steve Rabinowitz, a media consultant who also is employed by 
Barak, who has an office around the corner from Greenberg Quinlan. 
Rabinowitz, also a former White House staffer, worked with 
Greenberg on the Clinton campaign.

<HEADLINE> Death Penalty Teach-In Called Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- The city's schools superintendent has  
called off a teach-in focusing on a death row inmate convicted of 
murdering a policeman, saying the planned event had become too 
political. 
</P>
<P>
	``We recognize the importance of academic freedom, but there is  
no evidence that this teach-in will be balanced,'' Superintendent 
Carole Quan said in a statement Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The teach-in was to have centered on the controversial case of  
Mumia Abu-Jamal, convicted of killing a Philadelphia policeman in 
1981. By coincidence, the event was scheduled for Thursday -- the 
same day as a funeral for James Williams, an Oakland police officer 
killed last weekend by a sniper. 
</P>
<P>
	School Board President Noel Gallo, who had asked that the event  
be canceled, said the teach-in showed a lack of sensitivity to the 
family of the slain officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It clearly will demonstrate to our parents that within our  
teaching profession there are those who put their political agendas 
ahead of basic education for our children and there's no wonder why 
our test scores are so poor,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cancellation came hours after the Oakland Education  
Association, the teachers' union, had voted to go ahead with the 
teach-in. 
</P>
<P>
	Teacher Bob Mandel who helped organize the event, predicted many  
of his colleagues wouldn't give up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am positive that the teachers who are committed to this will  
teach the curriculum on Thursday,'' said Mandel, calling Ms. Quan's 
action, ``a massive violation of academic freedom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Quan had initially sanctioned the teach-in focusing on  
Abu-Jamal's controversial case. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal, a black activist and radio journalist, was arrested  
in 1981 after he was found wounded alongside the slain body of 
Philadelphia policeman Daniel Faulkner. He had been shot by 
Faulkner. Abu-Jamal's gun, with five spent shells, was found at the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters contend Abu-Jamal was framed. His jailhouse writing  
has made him a celebrity, and his efforts to win a new trial are 
backed by death penalty critics. 
</P>
<P>
	Proponents had defended the teach-in as a way to engage  
students' interest.

<HEADLINE> Hubbell Seeks Indictment Dismissal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Presidential friend Webster Hubbell is seeking  
dismissal of a new indictment by prosecutor Kenneth Starr, arguing 
that the case cannot be brought because of a 1994 deal prosecutors 
struck with him. 
</P>
<P>
	The former associate attorney general is accused in a 15-count  
grand jury indictment of covering up his and Hillary Rodham 
Clinton's roles in a fraud-riddled Arkansas land development called 
Castle Grande. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyers said in court papers this week that six of the  
charges against him are invalid because of a four-year-old plea 
bargaining agreement in which Hubbell admitted defrauding his 
former law firm and its clients of at least $394,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The court papers note that ``this indictment charges Mr. Hubbell  
... with a scheme to obtain fees by fraud'' from two federal 
regulatory agencies that were among the clients Hubbell admitted 
defrauding four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell is charged with fraud, making false statements and  
corruptly impeding the functions of the Resolution Trust Corp. and 
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., federal agencies that regulate 
the savings and loan industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Ark., where Hubbell and Mrs.  
Clinton were partners, performed work in 1985 and 1986 on the 
Castle Grande project for Madison Guaranty, a failing savings and 
loan owned by the Clintons' Whitewater business partners, Jim and 
Susan McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment alleges that Hubbell ``covered up ... the true  
nature of his'' and Mrs. Clinton's relationships with principals in 
the Castle Grande development, which was owned by Jim McDougal and 
Hubbell's father-in-law, Seth Ward. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's law firm work on Castle Grande came to light in  
January 1996 when her long-sought billing records turned up in the 
White House under circumstances that have never been explained. Her 
records were subpoenaed by Whitewater prosecutors in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Raising additional arguments for dismissal of the indictment,  
Hubbell's lawyers argued that prosecutors in 1996 ``implicitly 
promised not to indict him'' for earlier inconsistent statements 
about Castle Grande. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office ``had given Mr. Hubbell assurances, on the  
record, that it understood that his recollection concerning the 
very old events at issue would evolve and change; and that ... he 
should not worry about the fact that he had made earlier 
inconsistent statements,'' Hubbell's lawyers wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell's lawyers also wrote that a ``two-year delay'' in  
obtaining the grand jury indictment ``has impermissibly 
prejudiced'' his defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Why did Starr's office ``bring this indictment now, after key  
witnesses have become unavailable, when all the facts were known 
over two years ago?'' Hubbell's lawyers asked. 
</P>
<P>
	They said Starr himself ``strongly suggested'' that the decision  
to bring the case ``was influenced'' by information received from 
documents Hubbell supplied to prosecutors under a grant of 
immunity. Those documents have ``tainted'' the case against him, 
Hubbell's lawyers stated. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell's lawyers raised the possibility of seeking an  
evidentiary hearing to focus on how prosecutors assembled the case.

<HEADLINE> CBS Tries To Clone 60 Minutes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- There's a certain attitude common to  
most everyone connected with CBS's ``60 Minutes.'' They invented 
television newsmagazines, still feel theirs is better than anyone 
else's, and aren't hesitant to say so. 
</P>
<P>
	Some call that confidence. Others see arrogance. But these facts  
speak for themselves: 30 years on the air, a regular top-10 berth 
in the ratings, and the show by which other investigative TV 
journalism measures itself. 
</P>
<P>
	That swagger may be just what CBS needs to carry off the cloning  
of ``60 Minutes.'' The familiar stopwatch begins ticking tomorrow, 
announcing the arrival of ``60 Minutes II'' on Wednesday nights at 
9 p.m. EST. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a certain confidence in what we do, and I think (``60  
Minutes'' founder) Don Hewitt sets the tone,'' said Jeff Fager, 
executive producer of the new edition. ``It's a very confident, 
self-assured group ... You can feel that we have a pretty strong 
sense of who we are and what we want to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It can be seen in correspondent Morley Safer's suggestion when  
CBS's promotions team was thinking of ways to advertise the new 
edition and cut through the clutter of competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Does America really need another newsmagazine? Yes, if it's  
called `60 Minutes,''' was Safer's idea. 
</P>
<P>
	That, in essence, is what Fager is doing. ``60 Minutes II'' will  
precisely follow its parent's formula: three stories per hour, some 
viewer mail, some curmudgeonly commentary, although this time from 
humorist Jimmy Tingle instead of Andy Rooney. One story each week 
will update a tale already told on a Sunday ``60 Minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great model,'' Fager said. ``How could you ever ask for  
a greater model than `60 Minutes'? And why not take from what 
works?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The difference will come in the individual styles of the  
correspondents: Bob Simon, the CBS foreign correspondent who has 
contributed to ``60 Minutes,'' PBS interviewer Charlie Rose, CBS 
London correspondent Vicki Mabrey, and Carol Marin, who earned 
integrity points for quitting a Chicago newscast when station 
owners wanted to bring in Jerry Springer as a commentator. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a younger cast than ``60 Minutes,'' but not youthful.  
</P>
<P>
	``For the last several years, my two favorite places in the  
world have been `60 Minutes' and the nursing home where my 
father-in-law stays in eastern France,'' Simon said, ``because 
they're the only places where I'm occasionally called `young 
man.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Leading the pack is the seemingly overworked Dan Rather, who  
left as a ``60 Minutes'' correspondent when he took over as anchor 
of the ``CBS Evening News.'' He'll now do double duty, triple if 
you count continued contributions to ``48 Hours.'' And he's 67. 
(``60 Minutes'' star Mike Wallace is 80). 
</P>
<P>
	The new team has quickly learned the first rule of competition  
with the original show. ``If Mike wants to do it, he gets to do 
it,'' Rather explained. ``The ones he doesn't want to do or doesn't 
know about, then the rest of us have the right to squabble over 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For all the talk of ``60 Minutes'' as the Cathedral of  
Television Journalism, cloning was strictly a business decision. 
CBS executives saw NBC's success in spreading ``Dateline NBC'' 
throughout its schedule, and wanted a piece of the action. The old 
lions at ``60 Minutes'' roared in protest, but backed off when they 
saw they had little choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Fager's appointment was also key in calming the fears. He's a  
former Hewitt aide, a confidant of Rather when he was executive 
producer of the evening news, and an accepted member of the 
fraternity. Now he'll occasionally come to work and find a macho 
challenge taped to his office door by Hewitt: It's 6 a.m., I'm 
already here. Where are you? 
</P>
<P>
	CBS executives are already delighted that ``60 Minutes II'' has  
attracted advertisers that its entertainment programs couldn't on 
Wednesday nights. CBS's older audience has enabled the network to 
corner the new market of drug advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet expanding the franchise comes with risks. CBS is careful not  
to publicly state their ratings expectations for the new show, yet 
there's clearly pressure to perform financially. ``60 Minutes'' is 
a Sunday night habit for millions of viewers. Will the same type of 
show be as appealing on Wednesday nights? 
</P>
<P>
	Fager insists the second edition will have the same exacting  
standards for stories as its predecessor. But when Jack Kevorkian, 
the assisted-suicide advocate, came on ``60 Minutes'' in November, 
the controversy was dulled somewhat by Wallace's reputation. Will 
viewers give a controversial ``60 Minutes II'' story the same 
benefit of the doubt? 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to live up to the name `60 Minutes,' which is a  
daunting task,'' Fager said. ``What Don and everyone else have done 
over there through the years is really create something quite 
unique. It's that kind of storytelling that we're trying to live up 
to, and that's hard to do. Not everyone can do that, which is why I 
think it hasn't been copied before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I do get the feeling that all eyes are on us,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ...  
</P>
<P>
	ADOPTION ON `MAURY': The subject is close to Maury Povich's  
heart -- as most people know, he and wife Connie Chung adopted their 
child. On today's show (rescheduled from Wednesday), viewers meet 
kids of all ages from all over the country who have been in foster 
homes for most of their lives. Each youngster says what he or she

<HEADLINE> Pirates' Womack Signs for $1.65M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Pittsburgh Pirates second baseman Tony Womack,  
the NL stolen base leader the last two seasons, avoided salary 
arbitration Tuesday by agreeing to a $1.65 million, one-year 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Now all Womack has to do is keep his job.  
</P>
<P>
	Womack got a big raise from his 1998 salary of $290,000, even  
though the Pirates traded late last season for minor league 
infielder Warren Morris, already seen as one of the organization's 
best prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris, acquired from Texas in the Esteban Loaiza trade, is  
invited to spring training as a non-roster player but will likely 
begin the season at Triple-A Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
	``It won't be the first spring that I have to win a job and it  
won't be the last,'' Womack said. ``I don't worry about what the 
Pirates do (in trades). I can't worry about what they're trying to 
do down the road, I'm only looking for the moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Womack was tried in center field late last season, but the  
Pirates have since traded for Brant Brown to play there. Pirates 
manager Gene Lamont said recently there are no plans to shift 
Womack to another position. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite having one of the lowest on-base percentages of any NL  
leadoff hitter and drawing only 38 walks, Womack had 185 hits while 
batting .282 last season. He led the NL with 60 stolen bases in 
1997 and 58 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Womack doesn't doubt he will start the season as the Pirates'  
starting second baseman, even though Morris hit .331 at Double-A 
Carolina in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you take stuff like that (the Morris trade) personally, you  
really get caught up in, and you start to do things and say 
things,'' Womack said. ``I can't get caught up in it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Womack feels he has been unfairly tagged as a below-average  
fielder. Despite making 17 errors last season, his 771 total 
chances ranked among the NL leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I can play good defense, but I also know I get  
better,'' he said. ``That's why you keep playing, to get better. I 
know the areas where I want to improve. Just give me a chance. I 
improved in every area in 1998, and I'll improve in all areas in 
1999.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Womack also expects the Pirates to improve, even though they  
followed up a surprisingly good 1997 season by finishing last in 
the NL Central with a 69-93 record. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, the Pirates have added Brown, outfielder Brian  
Giles, left-hander Pete Schourek and infielder Mike Benjamin at a 
relatively low cost 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we made some good changes, some improvements, but the  
thing we've got to have is some chemistry,'' Womack said. ``We've 
got to get together and stay together, and get on on same page. 
</P>
<P>
	``We accept we had a disappointing year. I'm not pointing  
fingers, but we had a bad year. Now, all that matters is pushing 
forward in 1999, because 1998 is done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Womack's five-fold raise is partly the result of another  
offseason of free agent-driven salary inflation, with players such 
as Boston infielder Jose Offerman attracting huge contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we followed with what's happened with the market this  
winter, this contract is comparable to what middle infielders with 
Tony's major league service time are making,'' Pirates general 
manager Cam Bonifay said. '' I think it worked out to where it's 
fair for both sides.''

<HEADLINE> Rep. Kasich May Run for White House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. John Kasich, the boyish-looking House  
Budget Committee chairman from Ohio, will take the first step this 
week toward seeking the Republican presidential nomination, The 
Associated Press has learned. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich, 46, a ninth-term House member, will form an exploratory  
committee with the Federal Election Commission on Wednesday, 
allowing him to raise and spend money while he tests the waters, an 
official involved with the effort said Tuesday. He will announce 
this step Feb. 15 in Ohio, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich confidants say the lawmaker is almost certain to become a  
full-fledged candidate, but that announcement probably would come 
in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Another likely Republican candidate, former Vice President Dan  
Quayle, said Tuesday that national security should be a critical 
issue in the 2000 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``No presidential candidate should be taken seriously unless he  
or she understands the importance of foreign policy,'' Quayle told 
the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle, who plans to announce his intentions soon, refused  
Tuesday to critique potential rivals. But when asked about the 
foreign policy experience of a likely rival, Texas Gov. George W. 
Bush, Quayle said: ``Clearly experience helps. I don't need 
on-the-job training.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the Democratic side of the 2000 equation, former Sen. Bill  
Bradley of New Jersey formally became a presidential candidate 
Tuesday. Bradley, who formed an exploratory committee in December, 
quietly established the Bill Bradley for President Campaign with 
the FEC.

<P>
	``We're encouraged by the campaign's first efforts in fund  
raising,'' Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser said. His boss will soon 
visit early primary states New Hampshire and Iowa for the first 
time since his decision to explore the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley plans to formally announce his challenge to Vice  
President Al Gore in the spring. Gore, who formed his campaign Jan. 
1, hopes to benefit from President Clinton's support. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, it's a two-man Democratic field.  
</P>
<P>
	Sens. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Paul Wellstone of Minnesota  
bypassed uphill challenges to Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt is tempted to remain in the  
House and help Democrats try to capture the chamber in 2000, but he 
has not made a final decision. The Missouri Democrat, who would 
pose a severe threat to Gore, could announce his intentions as 
early as next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts and civil rights activist Jesse  
Jackson are determining whether to run. Kerry met with advisers in 
Boston on Tuesday to discuss a possible candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's staff is busy with the nuts and bolts of campaign  
organizing -- looking for office space and sifting through resumes. 
Their boss' busy travel schedule will take him to New Jersey, New 
York, Florida, Colorado, California and New Hampshire in the coming 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Gore named Johnny Hayes, a director of the Tennessee  
Valley Authority, to be the finance director of his campaign. Hayes 
held the same post in Gore's 1988 bid for the Democratic 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican presidential field will be more crowded.  
</P>
<P>
	Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, who failed to win the  
nomination in 1996, formed an exploratory committee Friday and 
plans to run again. Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Bob Smith of 
New Hampshire had already declared themselves candidates with the 
FEC. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other Republicans are almost certain to get into the  
race, including Quayle, millionaire Steve Forbes and conservative 
activist Gary Bauer. Bush is likely to run, but confidants caution 
that his candidacy is not certain. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading Republicans are streaming to Austin, Texas, to pay  
homage to the early favorite, asking him to help raise money in 
their states and promising their support if he runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Some supporters are telling potential donors in Washington that  
Bush may not accept federal matching money, which would free him of 
spending caps. However, Bush advisers say those decisions have not 
been made. 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech, Quayle said the Clinton administration  
``frittered away'' opportunities left by his boss, former President 
Bush. Clinton has stumbled with regard to policies in China, Cuba, 
Iraq, North Korea and Russia, Quayle said, adding he has also 
fumbled on issues like terrorism and strategic defense initiatives 
and in his duties to support troops and defense technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``Major issues are being ignored, standards are lowered,''  
Quayle said. ``There's a sinking feeling around the world that 
American has simply lost its will and credibility to lead.''

<HEADLINE> Scandal Doesn't Shock Spitz, Lewis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Salt Lake City bribery scandal is just an  
example of the way business is done in the Olympics, two of the 
greatest heroes of the games said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Spitz and Carl Lewis, who each won a record nine Olympic  
gold medals, said corruption was rampant in the bidding process for 
cities to stage the Summer and Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anyone believes that this is the first time this  
has happened,'' said Lewis, a sprint and long-jump champion from 
1984 through 1996. ``I don't think anyone believes that this has 
not gone on before. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know of any organization that has more power or makes  
more money that is less regulated in the entire world than the 
IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spitz, the winner of an unmatched seven swimming golds in 1972,  
said work as a consultant for Stockholm's unsuccessful bid for the 
2004 Summer Games showed him the darker side of the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``We communicated with the 100 or so (International Olympic  
Committee) delegates and there was this definite undertow in all 
the conversations, and that was, `What benefit is it going to be to 
my country?' which is more or less saying, `What benefit is it 
going to be to me if in effect I vote for this city,''' Spitz said 
at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The bribery scandal now under investigation in Salt Lake was  
inevitable, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the biggest problems the IOC has is that in the past it  
has allowed these delegates to be hosted by this city,'' Spitz 
said. ``Therein lies where the corruption started.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said the Olympics would survive the scandal because the  
athletes remain the stars. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it is said and done, the athletes got out there and  
performed and that's what we remember about the Olympics,'' he 
said. ``Not the organization or other people.''

<HEADLINE> Tyson Trainer Faces Challenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Tommy Brooks probably knows better than anyone  
how to fight Mike Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he has a new challenge -- teaching Mike Tyson how to fight  
again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to reinstall in him his boxing ability,'' Brooks  
said. ``We know he still has his power. It's getting that power to 
the opponent that we've been working on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks was an assistant trainer in Evander Holyfield's corner  
the night Holyfield battered Tyson before finally stopping him in 
the 11th round of their first heavyweight title fight. 
</P>
<P>
	He was there again when Tyson went berserk and bit Holyfield's  
ears. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks learned a lot in both fights, enough to prompt Tyson  
manager Shelly Finkel to look him up when it came time to find a 
trainer for Tyson's latest comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	``His problem is he never had a strategy against Evander,''  
Brooks said of Tyson. ``It was just his corner pointing to the guy 
across the ring and saying, `Go out there and knock him out.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks is the latest in a series of trainers Tyson has gone  
through since splitting with Kevin Rooney shortly after becoming 
the youngest heavyweight champion in the world at the age of 20. 
</P>
<P>
	He's not the first with ideas about how Tyson can recapture the  
form that once made him the most feared boxer in the sport. But he 
has Tyson's confidence and trust, which seemed to be lacking in 
other trainers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he had any faith in the others,'' Brooks said.  
``Mike is the kind of guy who has to like you. He just won't listen 
to anybody. He knows I'm sincere and not just here for a payday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks will be the only one in the corner shouting instructions  
Saturday night when Tyson begins his comeback with a scheduled 
10-round fight against South Africa's Francois Botha. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson has kept only a few people from his old entourage under  
Don King. Among the notable missing are Richie Giachetti, who 
trained Tyson for the second Holyfield fight, and Jay Bright, the 
trainer in the first. 
</P>
<P>
	For the last two months, Brooks has been with him daily in  
training camp, working with Tyson on things like head movement and 
punch combinations while trying to instill some confidence shaken 
in the losses to Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first I didn't think I would have enough time,'' Brooks  
said. ``But Mike and I just clicked, and it has been plenty of 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The time spent refining Tyson's boxing skills will be needed if  
he is to regain the heavyweight championship. Tyson in recent years 
has looked baffled at times in the ring, unable to get inside 
against some fighters and an easy target with his head for others. 
</P>
<P>
	That didn't make much difference against opponents who were  
either scared going into the ring or scared once they got into it. 
But Holyfield showed Tyson could be beaten by a fighter who is not 
afraid of moving forward and attacking against the former champion. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a dilemma Brooks realizes as he trains Tyson.  
</P>
<P>
	``The bully mystique that Mike always had is gone now after the  
two fights with Evander,'' Brooks said. ``He has to fight now. Guys 
aren't going to lay down now before they get into the ring like 
they did before.''

<HEADLINE> Denver Offense Makes Sweet Sounds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- No matter how many rounds of musical chairs the  
Denver Broncos play with their offensive line, they keep making 
sweet sounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Backup Matt Lepsis was forced into the lineup by an injury in  
Saturday's divisional playoff game against Miami, and the Broncos 
didn't miss a beat. 
</P>
<P>
	After left tackle Tony Jones limped to the sideline midway  
through the second quarter with a twisted knee, right tackle Harry 
Swayne switched to the left side and Lepsis settled into Swayne's 
old position. 
</P>
<P>
	To that point, Terrell Davis had run for 100 yards on 11  
carries. Afterward, he ran for 99 yards on 10 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	Such seamless substitution has become a trademark of this unit,  
which paved the way for Davis to rush for 1,750 yards in 1997 and 
then, after numerous changes in the preseason, helped orchestrate a 
2,008-yard season for the league's MVP this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought Harry did an exceptional job on the left side,''  
coach Mike Shanahan said. ``Matt did a good job. It wasn't perfect, 
but he really played hard and got the job done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Swayne hadn't worked at left tackle all season. ``It was  
weird,'' he said, ``since everything is backward. At first, I 
couldn't figure out what stance I wanted to get in. I didn't want 
to go the wrong way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teammates gave Lepsis high marks.  
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who is expected to return for Sunday's game, said he  
``didn't have to say anything to Matt -- except `good job.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback John Elway said Lepsis ``hasn't had a lot of playing  
time. But what he did was really special, and I told him that after 
the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lepsis, who played sparingly in four games this season, appeared  
more poised than in those tentative appearances. He was, however, 
still a bit excitable, accidentally decking teammate Derek Loville 
while attempting to offer congratulations after Loville's 11-yard 
touchdown run. Loville's score capped the drive on which Jones was 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really fired up,'' said Lepsis, a tight end at Colorado  
who has bulked up to 290 pounds. ``When I saw Tony go down, I knew 
I had to go in there and not let the team down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis' 199 yards and two touchdowns led the Broncos to a 38-3  
rout of the Dolphins, advancing the Broncos to Sunday's AFC 
championship game against the New York Jets at Mile High Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The offensive line was widely expected to be the Broncos'  
Achilles' heel as they sought to repeat as Super Bowl champions 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Pro Bowl left tackle Gary Zimmerman had retired, and veteran  
right guard Brian Habib signed a free-agent contract with Seattle. 
Habib's projected replacement, David Diaz-Infante, went down with a 
knee injury in the preseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones switched sides, becoming Zimmerman's replacement at the  
crucial left tackle position that protects Elway's blindside. 
Swayne, a backup in 1997, moved to right tackle, and second-year 
pro Dan Neil became the starting right guard. Only center Tom Nalen 
and left guard Mark Schlereth were in the same positions as in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Too many adjustments in a unit that demands cohesion? Most  
observers thought so. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos' offense, however, was even more prolific this year  
than in their Super Bowl season. Besides Davis' improved numbers, 
the offense as a whole gained 6,092 yards, compared to last year's 
5,872, and scored 501 points, compared to 472. Both figures were 
franchise records. The line also allowed only 25 sacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The line has been intact all season, with all five players  
starting every game, even though Schlereth underwent arthroscopic 
knee surgery on Oct. 12 -- the 21st surgery of his career. He had 
the operation prior to a bye week and was back in the starting 
lineup just 13 days after the surgery.

<HEADLINE> Border Patrol Can Be Sued for Stops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The Border Patrol can be sued for allegedly  
stopping drivers in southern Arizona just because they look 
Hispanic, a federal appeals court ruled Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 2-1 decision, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  
reinstated a class-action lawsuit on behalf of two groups: 
Hispanics who drive in an eight-county area of the state at any 
time, and people of any ethnicity who drive in the same area after 
dark, when agents allegedly can't tell whether a driver is 
Hispanic. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed by two Hispanic drivers in 1995, says both  
groups are commonly stopped without reasonable suspicion of illegal 
immigration, a claim based in part on the Border Patrol's own 
reports. The ruling allows the drivers to try to prove their case. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have overwhelming evidence of a pattern and practice on the  
part of the Border Patrol to stop Hispanics because they were 
Hispanics,'' said Armand Salese, lawyer for the drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	Although such stops have been forbidden by federal court rulings  
for many years, a review of between 2,000 and 3,000 Border Patrol 
reports of driver stops shows that management ``is encouraging that 
officers turn a blind eye'' to those rulings, Salese said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit seeks no money damages, only court orders  
prohibiting stops of drivers without reasonable suspicion of 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Border Patrol's regional office in Laguna Niguel, which  
oversees officers in Arizona, did not return a telephone call 
seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit was dismissed in 1997 by U.S. District Judge John Roll,  
who said the two drivers could not sue on behalf of all motorists 
because the circumstances of every Border Patrol stop were 
different. He said they could not sue on their own behalf because 
they had failed to show a likelihood that they would be stopped 
illegally in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	But the appeals court said every vehicle stop covered by the  
suit had one thing in common: the lack of reasonable suspicion of 
wrongdoing.

<HEADLINE> Hog Farmers Get Payment Timetable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hog farmers will have two weeks in February to  
sign up for up to $50 million in emergency payments being made to 
compensate for record low prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Under details released Tuesday by the Agriculture Department,  
about 80-90 percent of pork producers, or about 100,000, are 
eligible for the payments which are capped at $2,500 per operation. 
Farmers essentially will get $5 for up to 500 slaughter-weight hogs 
marketed during the last six months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Producers can sign up for the program from Feb. 1 to Feb. 12 at  
their local Farm Service Agency office. Payments will be made about 
two to three weeks after the sign up period, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This administration is committed to doing everything we can  
and using every authority we have to help struggling American famly 
farmers,'' said Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore announced the emergency aid Friday while  
in Iowa, the nation's largest hog-producing state. The payments 
come at a time when pork producers are getting their lowest prices 
in four decades. In December, those prices dipped to $8 to $10 per 
hundredweight, compared to $46.50 a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Producers are eligible if they marketed fewer than 1,000 hogs  
during the last six months of 1998 and are still in operation. In 
an effort to target the payments to smaller producers, operations 
whose 1998 gross income exceeded $2.5 million are ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers under fixed-price or cost-plus contracts are also  
ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
	The payments are being made under a federal food assistance  
program which permits direct payments to farmers to reestablish 
their purchasing power. Officials said the payments will not reduce 
the amount of assistance for federal food and nutrition programs.

<HEADLINE> Soybean, Grain Futures Fall / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean and grain futures prices plummeted for a  
second day Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade as traders worried 
about large crop sizes and waning demand. 
</P>
<P>
	The continued price drop followed the U.S. Department of  
Agriculture's release of 1998 crop reports showing a record soybean 
crop and the second-largest corn crop ever. The U.S. soybean crop 
was up 3 percent compared with 1997, according to the report. The 
corn crop was up 6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 wheat crop was slightly smaller than expected -- a  
downward trend that government officials say they expect to 
continue -- though that news did little to soften the fall for wheat 
futures. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders are also watching forecasts for rain that could boost  
soybean and grain crops in Brazil and Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery fell 4 1/4 cents to $2.81 1/2 a bushel; March  
corn dropped 2 1/2 cents to $2.17 1/4 a bushel; March oats fell 2 3/4 cents 
to $1.08 1/2 a bushel; and March soybeans fell 8 1/4 cents to $5.38 1/2 a 
bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Livestock futures were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.  
</P>
<P>
	February live cattle were unchanged at 62.32 a pound; March  
feeder cattle fell .03 cent at 72.92 cents a pound; February lean 
hogs rose the limit 2 cents to 41.20 cents a pound; February pork 
bellies were up the limit 3 cents to 55.22 cents a pound.

<TEXT>
<P>
	Light snow was falling over the Northeast, the Great Lakes, and  
parts of the Rockies and Plains this morning. Precipitation is 
expected to continue in those areas throughout much of the day, 
while the South and the Southwest were expected to enjoy dry 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
	A low pressure system in the Ohio Valley may slide along a  
frontal boundary into the Northeast today. The combination of these 
two features could produce a large area of precipitation extending 
from the Great Lakes through the Northeast. The northern extent of 
the precipitation should be in the form of snow. One to 4 inches of 
snow is expected from Iowa and Wisconsin, east through the Great 
Lakes, and into northern New England. The snowbelt regions along 
Lakes Michigan and Superior may see over six inches of snow. 
</P>
<P>
	A wintry mix of precipitation is predicted over northern parts  
of the Ohio Valley. Areas from northern and central Indiana and 
southern New England may see a mixture of sleet, snow, and freezing 
rain. Some minor ice accumulation will be possible. Rain showers 
are forecast across the southern Ohio Valley and the rest of the 
Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	The same frontal boundary is expected to cause unsettled weather  
in the Northwest and northern Plains, with a couple of inches of 
snow in the high Plains. Precipitation should end by this evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Further west, a general scattering of light snow and flurries is  
expected over the northern Rockies with minor accumulation. Rain 
and higher elevation snow may be likely later today along the 
Northwest coast. Snow is expected confined to elevations above 
5,000 feet, where 3 to 6 inches are be possible. 
</P>
<P>
	The southern tier of states is expected to see pleasant weather  
today. An area of high pressure off of the Southeast Coast is 
expected keep the region under partly cloudy skies and dry weather. 
High pressure is expected to also keep the southwestern United 
States dry. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the forecast calls for highs in the teens, 20s and 30s in  
most of the Northeast, the Great Lake states, and the northern 
Plains (where it may drop to single digits and below zero 
temperatures); in the 40s and 50s in most of the Northwest; in the 
50s and 60s across much of the Southeast and Southwest; and in the 
70s in most of Florida, southern California and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The high temperature in the Lower 48 on Monday was 78 at Davis  
Air Force Base, Ariz. The low was minus 27 in Ely, Minn.

<HEADLINE> Redskins Optimistic About Westbrook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- Doctors say that Washington Redskins  
receiver Michael Westbrook could return to football next season 
after undergoing neck surgery to repair a herniated disk. 
</P>
<P>
	Westbrook had two vertebrae fused together with a metal plate in  
the operation performed by Dr. Robert Watkins on Monday in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Redskins trainer Bubba Tyer said Tuesday that the surgery went  
``perfectly,'' adding that ``Westbrook has an excellent chance to 
return to football according to Watkins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Westbrook, the No. 4 overall selection in the 1995 draft, was  
having his best season when he was injured on a tackle by San Diego 
Chargers cornerback Charles Dimry Dec. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyer said Westbrook would be hospitalized for two or three more  
days, then wear a neck brace for six weeks. It will be three months 
before Westbrook can begin vigorous exercise and six months before 
any football contact. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no reason why Westbrook couldn't be ready for  
training camp,'' Tyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite playing in only 11 games, Westbrook finished tied for  
the team lead with a career-high 44 catches. He also set career 
marks with 736 yards and six touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	The troubled Westbrook was benched for two games at midseason  
after failing to make a team meeting and practice the day before a 
game.

<HEADLINE> Dome Din a Big Advantage for Vikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The blaring music, pounding drums and  
screaming fans. The Metrodome din gives the Minnesota Vikings as 
much of a home advantage as the Green Bay Packers hold on an icy 
day at Lambeau Field. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings aren't apologizing for the manmade help that has put  
them within one win of their first Super Bowl in 22 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who cares if it's fair or not. We earned it,'' running back  
Leroy Hoard said. ``Everybody has the same opportunity that we had 
to get home-field advantage. We got it. It's got to be good for 
something -- that noise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That noise is something the Atlanta Falcons will have to deal  
with in Sunday's NFC championship game. The Arizona Cardinals 
couldn't contend with it in the divisional round last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The racket helped rattle Arizona quarterback Jake Plummer into  
three turnovers that led to 17 points for the Vikings in their 
41-21 victory. The decibel level wasn't the difference for 
Minnesota -- its offense was -- but it helped. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point just before kickoff, Cardinals tackle Lomas Brown  
and some teammates tried to communicate by screaming while standing 
next to each other. They couldn't hear. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither could Hoard nor Robert Smith, who were side by side on  
the Vikings' side of the field. Plummer said there were times 
during the game when he couldn't hear offensive coordinator Marc 
Trestman, who was speaking directly into his helmet from the 
coaches booth via microphone. 
</P>
<P>
	``(The) crowd was a big part of it,'' Atlanta coach Dan Reeves  
said of Minnesota's victory Sunday. ``(It) gave Arizona a lot of 
problems early in the game. Those are the type of things we've got 
to be ready to deal with. You can't change them. They're going to 
be there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most annoying, and some say most disrupting part of the dome  
noise, is the roar through the speaker system. The Vikings blast 
heavy metal music and other canned noise into the arena to help 
whip the fans into a frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers complained loudly about the piped-in noise after  
their 28-14 loss at the dome Nov. 22. Their biggest beef was about 
on-field speakers the Vikings say they use to channel the music to 
the cheerleaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Vikings vice president of business operations Rand Gottlieb  
contends the team stays within league rules for stadium noise, 
including turning off all artificial sound when the opposing 
offense breaks the huddle. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's when the fans take over, with 64,000 screaming as the  
quarterback slips behind center. That's helped the Vikings (16-1) 
go 9-0 at home this season, winning by an average score of 36-13. 
They are 11-point favorites against the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the loudspeakers and crowd noise, our communication was  
messed up all day,'' Arizona center Aaron Graham said. ``It was 
almost non-existent. It forced us into trying things we haven't 
tried before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's the dome-field advantage, something the Minnesota Twins  
used to win World Series titles in 1987 and 1991. No dome team ever 
has made it to the Super Bowl, but Sunday's matchup guarantees one 
finally will. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to their enthusiastic fans, the Falcons (15-2) enjoyed a  
similar edge against San Francisco last weekend at the Georgia 
Dome. Now they'll feel what it's like to be in what Vikings owner 
Red McCombs calls the noisest stadium in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Vikings aren't concerned with what anyone thinks of that  
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want me to feel sorry for it?'' Hoard said. ``I don't.''

<P>
	WAXAHACHIE, Texas (AP) -- A motorist apparently lost control of  
her car and crashed into a post office Tuesday, killing a woman and 
injuring five people. 
</P>
<P>
	Mildred Louise Menges, 71, died when she was struck by a  
Cadillac as she stood in the service area of the U.S. Postal 
Service facility in this rural north Texas city. 
</P>
<P>
	Three people were treated for minor injuries at a hospital and  
released. The Postal Service said two other customers were treated 
at the scene for minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that the elderly female driver unfortunately placed  
her foot on the accelerator versus the brake,'' said McKinney Boyd 
of the Postal Service's Dallas District. 
</P>
<P>
	No charges had been filed against the driver, Mary Louise  
Middleton, 77, who was parking in front of the post office. Police 
were reviewing the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Her car traveled 30 to 40 feet through the building after  
driving over shrubbery and breaking through the front plate-glass 
window into the lobby, then ramming a glass door leading into the 
service area, said Deputy Police Chief Craig Rudolph.

<HEADLINE> GOP Ties Larry Flynt to White House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans suggested Tuesday that the White  
House may be involved in Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt's 
efforts to brand Georgia Rep. Bob Barr -- one of the House 
impeachment managers -- as a hypocrite for his past personal 
conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``If that's the best he can do, the White House ought to get  
another agent,'' said Rep. John Linder, R-Ga., a former chairman of 
the National Republican Campaign Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Republicans should  
produce evidence or ``knock it off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson said James  
Carville, one of President Clinton's longtime supporters, may be 
linked to Flynt's attempt to use legal proceedings from Barr's 1986 
divorce to embarrass him just days before he's scheduled to help 
present the House case against Clinton in his Senate impeachment 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``When General Carville declared war on the president's enemies,  
private Flynt enlisted,'' said Nicholson. 
</P>
<P>
	Carville denied any involvement with Flynt and said he hasn't  
spoken to him in over a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have anything to do with it,'' he said. ``I think it's  
stupid to look into people's sex lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart denied any White House link to Flynt.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's an absolutely baseless charge,'' he said. ``And at some  
point, there ought to be a price to pay for making baseless charges 
and practicing the politics of innuendo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said Clinton repeatedly has denounced the ``politics of  
personal destruction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Nicholson nor Linder offered any evidence to support  
their claim of White House involvement in Flynt's crusade, which 
started with a $1 million offer last fall for evidence of sexual 
misconduct by top political leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Flynt released a Jan. 8 affidavit from Barr's former wife -- the  
publisher admits he paid her for the affidavit -- in which she says 
she believes he was having an affair in the mid 1980s with a woman 
who is now his present wife. She based the allegation largely on 
1986 depositions from Barr and his present wife in which both 
refused to answer questions about their relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	Gail Vogel Barr, who was divorced from the congressman in  
November 1986, also says in the affidavit that he did not try to 
discourage her from having an abortion in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Barr, who switched his views from pro-choice to anti-abortion  
during a 1992 campaign for the Senate, said in a statement he 
``never suggested, urged, forced or encouraged anyone to have an 
abortion.'' He also said he had ``never perjured myself'' in a 
court proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
	Interviewed on CNN, Barr said Tuesday night that Flynt's  
accusations were ``a thinly veiled effort by the president's 
defenders to detract us from'' presenting the House's impeachment 
case in the Senate. He said both he and Clinton had three options 
in their affidavits: tell the truth, assert a privilege under law 
or lie. 
</P>
<P>
	``One difference between Bill Clinton and I is that he chose  
that last one; he lied,'' Barr said. He declined to be more 
specific about any role he may have had in his former wife's 
abortion.

<HEADLINE> Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Kills Two </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Carbon monoxide trapped by an  
ice-clogged chimney killed a couple and sickened 17 others 
including their daughter and neighbors in three adjoining 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters initially responded to reports of a gas leak on  
Sunday at an apartment building, fire battalion chief Al 
Huelsenbeck said. 
</P>
<P>
	They soon discovered the gas was emanating from next door, and  
when rescue workers forced their way into the house, they found two 
people dead, Huelsenbeck said. The carbon monoxide level inside the 
house was more than 10 times the level at which carbon monoxide 
detectors are set to ring, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, 17 people required medical treatment, including 11 at  
the apartment building next to the house where the deaths occurred, 
and people in two other adjoining buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators found that the chimney and furnace flue were  
clogged with dirt, soot, broken bricks, birds' nests, leaves and 
ice. The cold weather probably froze all the material solid, 
sealing up the small holes so none of the exhaust could get out, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerald Mitchell, 55, and Katie J. Hicks, 43, were pronounced  
dead at the scene. Tomica Collins, 18, who neighbors said was the 
couple's daughter, was hospitalized in serious condition Sunday 
evening at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital.

<HEADLINE> Bulls' Dynasty Could Be Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Bring the rest of 'em back? Or allow the wrecking ball to come  
crashing down on the rest of the dynasty? 
</P>
<P>
	Those are the questions Chicago Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf and  
general manager Jerry Krause will have to answer. As of now, it 
looks like they're unsure of which path they'll choose. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday night's news that Jordan is planning to retire will have  
an immediate impact on the rest of Chicago Bulls. With only four 
players under contract and 10 free agents, the possibilities are 
many. 
</P>
<P>
	Should they re-sign Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman and try to  
build from there? And what about Steve Kerr, Jud Buechler, Luc 
Longley, Scott Burrell, Joe Kleine and Bill Wennington, the other 
free agents? 
</P>
<P>
	All could be expendable if the Bulls decide to completely  
rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
	But all of them could be back, too, if Reinsdorf and Krause  
think the team has a chance to be a champion without Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guys we have back are basically young,'' Krause said of  
the Bulls' four players under contract: Toni Kukoc, Ron Harper, 
Randy Brown and Keith Booth. ``(We would) add more youth to them 
and see where we go from there to build another championship team. 
We did that once before a number of years ago with youth, stayed 
with youth and added veterans as we went along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls technically will remain over the salary cap until they  
renounce their rights to Jordan. But once that happens, and if they 
decide not to keep Pippen and Rodman, they will be in position to 
immediately become a major player in a free-agent market that 
includes Antonio McDyess, Damon Stoudamire, Jerry Stackhouse and 
Rod Strickland. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the agent for Rodman, a return by most of Jordan's  
supporting cast isn't out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
	``This means that Dennis will not be playing with Michael again,  
but everything else is up in the air,'' agent Dwight Manley said. 
``By saying their first priority was to bring the entire team back, 
I feel that demonstrated their sincerity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They still have to field a team, and there's a lot of  
possibilities as to how they could do it,'' Manley said. 
</P>
<P>
	How's this for an opening night lineup: Kukoc, Harper, Eddie  
Jones, Elden Campbell and McDyess? 
</P>
<P>
	It's not out of the question, and here's how it could happen:  
</P>
<P>
	Krause, the only executive able to sign Pippen to a contract  
worth more than $10 million annually, makes an agreement with 
Pippen's agent to sign him and trade him. Under the rules of the 
new collective bargaining agreement, such a transaction would be 
permissible if Pippen's new contract was for at least three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Krause then would trade Pippen to another team that could put  
together a package of players whose salaries would equal Pippen's. 
Campbell ($7 million) and Jones ($2.2 million) would put the Lakers 
in that ballpark, and since Los Angeles needs a ballhandler now 
that Nick Van Exel is gone, Pippen would be a perfect fit. 
</P>
<P>
	If such a trade were made, Krause would then have to decide  
whether to renounce the rights to Rodman and the other free agents 
to clear them off the salary cap. If none of them were taking up 
space, the Bulls would be close to having $9 million in cap room to 
offer McDyess. 
</P>
<P>
	If McDyess liked the idea of Chicago instead of Phoenix, Houston  
or Denver, it might work. 
</P>
<P>
	The roster could be filled out with a player taking the new  
average salary exception, another player taking the $1 million 
exception and four or five others playing for the minimum. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time opening night arrives, a majority of the players due  
to receive rings could be absent. 
</P>
<P>
	If Jordan shows up, he might not even recognize the Bulls.  
</P>
<P>
	First, it'll be up to the Jerrys to decide how much dismantling  
they'll do.

<HEADLINE> Gordon Forms Own CART Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Team Gordon could bridge the gap between  
Championship Auto Racing Teams and the rival Indy Racing League. 
</P>
<P>
	Robby Gordon, an Indy driver for seven years, has formed his own  
team that will compete in the CART series in 1999. But one of his 
partners is John Menard, an IRL car owner who says the bitterness 
between the two series has waned. 
</P>
<P>
	There's even a chance Gordon could drive at Indianapolis, either  
with his own team or in a second car for Menard. 
</P>
<P>
	``The CART series is obviously more developed than the IRL  
series,'' Menard said Tuesday. ``But the IRL teams are testing at 
Phoenix along with (Chip) Ganassi's team from the CART side. ... 
This whole thing is getting closer and closer to being more 
together on a more businesslike basis. You just wouldn't have 
dreamt of doing that a couple years ago. Everybody hated each other 
so badly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now because we've got a common (tire) sponsor in Firestone,  
it's no big deal to be out there testing the CART cars with the IRL 
cars. I'm excited for the future of both series,'' Menard said. 
``The animosity has passed to the point where that is not a 
concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Menard won the 1997 IRL championship with Tony Stewart as  
driver. Stewart, who next season will drive for Joe Gibbs in the 
NASCAR Winston Cup series, was replaced by Greg Ray, and Menard 
said Gordon might occupy a second Menard car at Indy. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, 30, had a brief try in NASCAR with Team Sabco in 1997,  
then drove for Arciero-Wells and finished 23rd in the CART 
standings last season. He has two victories among 86 starts in his 
seven-year Indy racing career 
</P>
<P>
	``This is beginning of something very special, something I've  
wanted to do all my career,'' he said from Team Gordon headquarters 
in Anaheim, Calif. ``It's going to be very tough to do, but I 
believe we've assembled a great group of guys. This is something we 
talked about last year in October. ... We built the facility a year 
ago to eventually have an Indy-car team based here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon hired Laurie Gerrish, who previously worked for such  
teams as Penske and Walker Racing, as team manager. Dave Forbes, 
who worked with Gordon in 1997, will be crew chief. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got experienced mechanics, experienced engineers, and  
we're going to keep it to the basics,'' Gordon said. ``Being a new 
team, we're a little late. We won't receive the (Swift-Toyota) cars 
until the mid-to-end of February, and that's going to put us a 
little behind the 8-ball. But when we have our cars, we're ready to 
go straight to the race track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Menard said there would be no problem being involved in two race  
teams, even two that are in rival series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Between Robby and (partner) Mike Held, they're going to run  
the CART team. I'll continue to spend my time with the IRL team,'' 
Menard said. ``I think it's going to work just fine. There are 
things we'll learn from one another that will be beneficial to both 
teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Gordon wouldn't rule out bringing his own team back to  
Indianapolis, which has been boycotted by CART since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of race car drivers want to be there,'' Gordon said.  
``As a race team, we're in the business of doing what our sponsors 
want. We have some sponsors that are very interested in the Indy 
500. With the sponsors we have now (Menard, Panasonic, Johns 
Manville, Duracell), there's a very good chance we're going to be 
at the Indy 500.''

<HEADLINE> Feds Urge MD-11 Wiring Inspections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Transportation Safety Board is  
suggesting that airlines be told to inspect MD-11 aircraft for 
signs of electrical trouble like that found in the wreckage of 
Swissair Flight 111. 
</P>
<P>
	The board said it was concerned by signs of heat damage and  
electrical arcing found by Canadian investigators in an overhead 
cockpit panel and the avionics circuit bay of the doomed plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian authorities revealed at a news briefing Monday that  
they also had found chafed, cracked and broken wires around the 
cockpits of more than a dozen in-service MD-11s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although the apparent electrical arcing on Swissair Flight 111  
has not been determined to be a source of fire, and Swissair's 
voluntary inspections of its MD-11 airplanes have not uncovered any 
serious discrepancies, the safety board is concerned about the 
recent discoveries,'' NTSB Chairman Jim Hall wrote to Jane Garvey, 
administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The board said the FAA should require an inspection of all  
MD-11s for wiring discrepancies around the cockpit overhead circuit 
panel and the avionics circuit breaker panel. It said the 
inspection should include examinations for loose wiring, 
inconsistent wire routings, broken bonding wires and chafed and 
cracked wire insulation. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA spokeswoman Diane Spitaliere said that even before it  
received the recommendation, the agency ``had started to develop 
rule-making actions that address the wiring concerns raised by the 
Swissair accident. These proposed actions are on a fast track and 
we expect to issue them shortly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA has already ordered more limited inspections and repairs  
around the plane's forward passenger doors and in an electrical 
switch in the cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
	There are 186 MD-11s in the worldwide fleet, of which roughly 65  
are flown by U.S. airlines. While FAA orders do not apply to 
foreign-registered aircraft, aviation authorities typically follow 
each other's safety recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swissair plane, bound from New York to Geneva, plunged into  
the ocean off Nova Scotia on Sept. 2. The crash occurred 16 minutes 
after the pilots reported smoke in the cockpit. All 229 aboard were 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators still have not determined the cause of the crash,  
but they are focusing on signs of heat and fire damage in the 
cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, the FAA ordered a one-time inspection of MD-11s to  
detect problems such as nicks, fraying or chafing above the left 
and right front passenger doors. Any problems had to be repaired. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators learned that when the doors were raised to the  
open position, sliding panels above them moved inward and could 
chafe the electrical wiring in those areas. That could lead to an 
electrical fire in the passenger cabin. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, the FAA ordered airlines to inspect lighting dimmer  
switches in the MD-11 cockpit. The agency was concerned the 
switches might overheat and smoke, distracting the pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	Swissair agreed in October to discontinue use of an advanced  
in-flight entertainment system on its MD-11s and some Boeing 747s 
as a safeguard against electrical problems after Canadian 
investigators detected signs of heat damage on wiring and other 
debris from the ceiling around the cockpit.

<HEADLINE> Audit: IRS System a Privacy Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Although the IRS is making some progress, a  
new audit says chronic computer system weaknesses continue to place 
sensitive taxpayer data at risk of theft, fraud and even misuse by 
hackers. 
</P>
<P>
	``They still have a long way to go,'' said Sen. Fred Thompson,  
R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Personal information on IRS computers is at risk to  
unauthorized disclosure, destruction or modification, and most 
alarmingly, to identity theft,'' Thompson said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The audit by the congressional General Accounting Office of six  
IRS facilities, also found that 397 computer tapes containing 
taxpayer information had been lost. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO credited the Internal Revenue Service with making some  
major leaps forward in improving computer security since another 
critical audit in April 1997. The IRS says it has corrected 75 
percent of the problems identified in that report. 
</P>
<P>
	But the GAO said ``serious weaknesses'' remain. Among them:  
</P>
<P>
	--Computer hackers could access IRS data with relative ease  
because information isn't encrypted before it is transmitted over 
telephone lines. IRS says it has no evidence such a crime has 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	--Too many IRS employees have access to sensitive computing  
areas, raising the possibility of information theft. 
</P>
<P>
	--Employees without a need to know have the ability to change or  
delete taxpayer information. Some tapes and disks are not 
overwritten before being used again, allowing unauthorized access 
to some of this information, including Social Security numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	--The new IRS system aimed at catching employees who illegally  
``browse'' through taxpayer files is working on only one of several 
computer systems, and it cannot detect which activities are 
legitimate and which are not. 
</P>
<P>
	--Few contingency plans are in place in case of disaster, such as  
an alternative computer processing site or effective backup 
electric generators. 
</P>
<P>
	In a written response, IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti said he  
agreed with many of the conclusions and GAO recommendations, but he 
insisted that the agency is well on the way to a more complete 
turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
	Rossotti, whose background in the private sector focused on  
information systems, said the initial focus has been on larger data 
processing systems and it is now moving into other areas. But he 
noted that making these changes at the agency's more than 1,000 
facilities ``cannot be completed in a few years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A new centralized IRS systems office completed a review of what  
needed to be done at all district offices in December and has now 
begun examining all other offices. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that managing risk and prioritizing corrective  
actions and resources is the key to making needed and measurable 
improvements,'' Rossotti said in his response. ``Protecting 
taxpayer information and the systems used to deliver services to 
taxpayers are key to the success of a customer-focused IRS.''

<HEADLINE> Audit: IRS System a Privacy Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chronic weaknesses in the IRS computer system  
are putting sensitive personal information about taxpayers at risk 
of improper uses, including theft and fraud, according to an audit 
released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The audit by the congressional General Accounting Office of six  
IRS facilities also found that 397 computer tapes containing 
taxpayer data had been lost. 
</P>
<P>
	``Personal information on IRS computers is at risk to  
unauthorized disclosure, destruction or modification, and most 
alarmingly, to identity theft,'' said Senate Governmental Affairs 
Committee Chairman Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., who requested the audit. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO credited the Internal Revenue Service with making some  
major leaps forward in improving computer security since another 
critical audit in April 1997. The IRS says it has corrected 75 
percent of the problems identified in that report. 
</P>
<P>
	But the GAO said ``serious weaknesses'' remain. Among them:  
</P>
<P>
	--Computer hackers could access IRS data with relative ease  
because information isn't encrypted before it is transmitted over 
telephone lines. IRS says it has no evidence such a crime has 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	--Too many IRS employees have access to sensitive computing  
areas, and some tapes containing taxpayer information have been 
lost. 
</P>
<P>
	--Employees without a need to know have the ability to change or  
delete taxpayer information. Some tapes and disks are not 
overwritten before being used again, allowing unauthorized access 
to some of this information, including Social Security numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	--The new IRS system aimed at catching employees who illegally  
``browse'' through taxpayer files is working on only one of several 
computer systems, and it cannot detect which activities are 
legitimate and which are not. 
</P>
<P>
	--Few contingency plans are in place in case of disaster, such as  
an alternative computer processing site or effective backup 
electric generators. 
</P>
<P>
	In a written response, IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti said he  
agreed with many of the conclusions and GAO recommendations, but he 
insisted that the agency is well on the way to a more complete 
turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
	Rossotti, whose background in the private sector focused on  
information systems, said the initial focus has been on larger data 
processing systems and it is now moving into other areas. But he 
noted that making these changes at the agency's ``over 1,000 
facilities cannot be completed in a few years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A new centralized IRS systems office completed a review of what  
needed to be done at all district offices in December and has now 
begun examining all other offices. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that managing risk and prioritizing corrective

<HEADLINE> Ore. Anti-Abortion Defendant Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- A defendant in a multimillion-dollar  
lawsuit against anti-abortion activists acknowledged on the stand 
Tuesday that he has made numerous statements advocating lethal 
force to prevent abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Burnett, publisher of Life Advocate magazine, testified  
as a hostile witness in the federal trial that claims fliers made 
out to look like wanted posters and a Web site listing the names, 
addresses and phone numbers of abortion doctors were nothing more 
than invitations to murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Burnett's testimony is key to the case because plaintiffs'  
lawyers claim his refusal to condemn slayings of abortion doctors 
added to the threatening nature of the ``Deadly Dozen'' fliers and 
the Web site called ``The Nuremberg Files,'' even though they 
contained no explicit threats. 
</P>
<P>
	Burnett gave only brief, carefully worded replies in his  
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Burnett was asked whether he signed a petition  
distributed by Paul Hill, who was later convicted in the 1994 
murder of an abortion doctor in Pensacola, Fla. The petition read 
in part: ``The use of lethal force is justified if it is carried 
out for the purpose or protecting the lives of unborn children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I gave permission for my name to be used,'' Burnett replied.  
</P>
<P>
	He also was asked whether he said in 1993 that ``people should  
be willing to take a life to defend another life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That may have been part of what I said,'' Burnett answered.  
</P>
<P>
	Burnett, of Portland, is one of 14 individual defendants in the  
lawsuit, which also names the American Coalition of Life Advocates, 
an umbrella group for several anti-abortion groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense claims the fliers and the Web site are merely a form  
of political protest protected by the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs, including abortion doctors and clinics, contend  
the materials violate a 1994 federal law that bars activists from 
inciting violence against abortion doctors and their patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Several doctors have testified they began wearing bulletproof  
vests and disguises after their names appeared on the Web site as 
``baby butchers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They said their fear intensified in October, when Dr. Barnett  
Slepian's name was crossed off the list shortly after a sniper 
killed him at his home outside Buffalo, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Burnett said he had no direct involvement in putting together  
the ``Nuremberg Files.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``All the information in those files can be legally obtained,''  
he said under questioning from his own attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	Burnett said his group has published pictures of, and picketed,  
abortion doctors and their homes to put pressure on those doctors 
to stop their practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a perfectly legal thing to do,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> MediaNews, Donrey Papers Make Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- MediaNews Group Inc. will take control of 10  
Donrey Media Group daily newspapers in California under a deal 
announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	William Dean Singleton's MediaNews said its Garden State  
Newspapers subsidiary will merge 10 of its California newspapers 
with the Donrey newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal would expand MediaNews' presence in Northern California  
and in the greater Los Angeles market, where it already owns the 
Los Angeles Daily News and Press-Telegram of Long Beach. Those 
newspapers are not included in the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Garden State Newspapers will own two-thirds of the new group and  
Donrey will own one-third. MediaNews will manage the group, which 
will publish 20 daily newspapers with a daily circulation of about 
531,000 and a Sunday circulation of about 493,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is expected to close Feb. 1. The financial terms were  
not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Donrey daily newspapers include the Inland Valley Daily  
Bulletin of Ontario, the Vallejo Times-Herald, the Chico 
Enterprise-Record, The Hemet News, The Daily Democrat of Woodland, 
The Lompoc Record, the Ukiah Daily Journal, the Daily News of Red 
Bluff, the Oroville Mercury Register and the Redlands Daily Facts. 
</P>
<P>
	Also included are Donrey's non-daily Advocate-News of Fort Bragg  
and The Valley Times of Moreno Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	The Garden State Newspapers include the San Gabriel Valley  
Tribune of West Covina, The Whittier Daily News, the Star-News of 
Pasadena, The Oakland Tribune, The Daily Review of Hayward, the 
Tri-Valley Herald of Pleasanton, The Argus of Fremont, The Alameda 
Times-Star, The San Mateo County Times, and the Times-Standard of 
Eureka, plus 23 non-daily newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	Donrey, headquartered in Fort Smith, Ark., is owned by Stephens  
Group Inc. of Little Rock, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	``Donrey is owned by an investor who understands the marketing  
and operational opportunities in forming this California 
partnership,'' Singleton said. ``While all of these newspapers are 
good newspapers on a stand-alone basis, operating together they 
will provide important new synergies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MediaNews also owns The Denver Post and about 40 other daily  
newspapers in 13 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Donrey continues to own 14 other newspapers in eight states,  
including the Las Vegas Review Journal. Last July, Donrey sold 28 
newspapers to Community Newspaper Holdings Inc. of Birmingham, Ala.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets closed lower Tuesday,  
with the key index slipping in Tokyo for the third straight 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 7.51  
points, or 0.06 percent, to close at 13,360.97. On Monday, the 
average shed 23.33 points, or 0.17 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said investors were sidelined by the uncertain direction  
of the dollar-yen exchange rate. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 112.50 yen in late afternoon trading,  
up 2.28 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also well above its late 
New York level of 108.93 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar sank as low as 108.65 yen in early trading but then  
rebounded sharply, rising as high as 112.85 yen after the Bank of 
Japan intervened. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the central bank's first intervention in support of the  
dollar since February of 1996, the Nihon Keizai business daily 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	A stronger yen tends to make Japanese exports more expensive  
abroad and cuts into profits earned overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone is watching the currency markets,'' said Kunihiro  
Hatae of Tokyo Securities Co. in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Bucking the trend was the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, where share  
prices rebounded on a late rally in the futures market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index. the Hong Kong market's indicator of blue  
chips, rose 77.29 points, or 0.7 percent, to close at 10,711.56. 
</P>
<P>
	The index mirrored the January Hang Seng Index futures contract,  
which ended 210 points higher at 10,711.56, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people think the worst is probably over for Asia, and  
the Hong Kong market is now cheaper than those in the U.S. and 
Europe,'' said Percy Au-Young of DBS Securities (HK) Ltd. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Conn. Town Will Honor King Holiday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WALLINGFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The only Connecticut town that did not  
give municipal workers paid time off for Martin Luther King Jr. Day 
will observe the holiday this year for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision announced Monday by Wallingford Mayor William  
Dickinson to give city workers an additional paid holiday came in 
the face of mounting public and union pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	``Self-interest, polarization and confrontation threaten to  
undermine the values of justice and peace, which are so important 
to everyone. I will not allow Dr. King's message to be so 
devalued,'' Dickinson said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The holiday falls on Jan. 18 this year.  
</P>
<P>
	City unions had insisted that the holiday should be added to the  
existing list of 12 paid days off, while Dickinson had maintained 
until Monday that 12 paid holidays were enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why should we give up a holiday for a day that every other  
town in the state celebrates?'' said Bill Myerson, a spokesman for 
the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, 
one of the unions that represents town employees. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear if the holiday would be an annual occurrence or  
one time only. Dickinson did not immediately return a call today.

<HEADLINE> Tuggle Finally Proud To Be a Falcon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- Jessie Tuggle never considered leaving the  
Atlanta Falcons, even though he knew his team was holding him back. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over my career, it hurt me a lot, kept me from being  
recognized as an All-Pro player,'' Tuggle said. ``I had some great 
seasons ... some awesome seasons, that I didn't get recognized 
for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not that he's been totally overlooked, earning enough respect  
from his peers to be voted to the Pro Bowl five times, including 
this season. Still, he might have been recognized among the great 
middle linebackers in NFL history on a better team. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons had a winning record only twice in Tuggle's first 11  
seasons before going 15-2 this season, winning the NFC West and 
advancing to the conference championship game for the first time. 
They meet Minnesota on Sunday for a trip to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the year I'm most proud of,'' Tuggle said. ``We  
established ourselves in the NFL and made people respect us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuggle went through a similar struggle early in his career.  
</P>
<P>
	An undrafted free agent from tiny Valdosta State in south  
Georgia, he needed three seasons to become a full-time starter, but 
by 1990 he was leading the NFL in tackles. The following year, he 
did even better with a career-high 207 stops, again leading the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither season was he selected for the Pro Bowl.  
</P>
<P>
	``This league is all about recognizing the winners,'' Tuggle  
said. ``It's tough to single each and every individual out. There 
are other guys out there who might have a story like my story. At 
the same time, you can't get tied up in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuggle said the idea of moving to another team ``never really  
crossed my mind.'' He just kept showing up for training camp every 
year, hoping against sometimes hopeless odds that he would get to 
play for a winning team in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even the times when we were struggling -- and there were many  
years when we did struggle -- I always wanted to be a part of this 
organization when they got it turned around,'' said Tuggle, a 
Georgia native. ``I knew one of these days we'd get it turned 
around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those who have watched Tuggle throughout his 12-year career  
believe his impact on the NFL has been overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a guy who went into the Hall of Fame last year named  
Mike Singletary,'' said Tommy Nobis, a former Falcons linebacker 
and now a team executive. ``I would take Jessie Tuggle over Mike 
Singletary. I've watched this guy. I know what he is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's one major difference, though. Singletary performed the  
``Super Bowl Shuffle'' for the Chicago Bears; Tuggle's career has 
been spent with a sad song known as the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Jessie Tuggle was playing for the Dallas Cowboys ... he  
couldn't win enough John Madden awards and turkey presentations,'' 
Falcons safety Eugene Robinson said. ``He'd be a perennial All-Pro. 
His name would be synonymous with Mike Singletary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuggle, 33, appeared to be slowing the last couple of seasons.  
Perhaps he was worn down by all those hits -- he is the NFL's active 
leading tackler with 1,902 -- or maybe he was just tired of losing. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, Tuggle managed only 113 tackles, the lowest total  
since his rookie season. He didn't lead the team in tackles for the 
first time since 1988. His aging legs are no longer fast enough to 
keep him on the field in obvious passing situations. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking beyond the numbers, however, most observers -- players,  
coaches and those who follow the team on a regular basis -- feel 
he's playing better than he has in years. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuggle agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think my game is more physical,'' he said. ``The quickness  
is there. The endurance is there. I'm able to read and recognize 
plays a lot quicker and a lot faster. That gives me the ability to 
make plays that some linebackers can't make.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuggle's knack of getting to the ball-carrier is uncanny, and  
his intense style of play sets the tone for the Falcons' 
aggressive, hard-hitting defense. 
</P>
<P>
	In the divisional playoff victory over San Francisco last week,  
Tuggle stuffed Terry Kirby on the second play of the game, showing 
right away that Atlanta wasn't going to be intimidated by the 
49ers. On the next play, Marc Edwards was stopped on short on 
third-and-inches. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the second and third play of that game set the tone of  
what was going to happen the rest of the game for us on defense,'' 
said Rich Brooks, the defensive coordinator. ``It was going to be a 
physical football game and if they were going to get something, 
they were going to have to earn it. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the way Jessie plays.''

<HEADLINE> Sources: Gingrich May Run for Gov. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has spoken  
with associates about a possible run for governor of Georgia in 
2002, a post no Republican has held since Reconstruction, GOP 
sources said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is it a possibility, sure it is,'' said one official, who  
spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Has he thought about it, yes, 
but not in an overwhelming way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich had once been mentioned as a possible contender for the  
Republican presidential nomination in 2000, but that talk faded 
with the GOP loss of House seats in November and his subsequent 
decision to leave Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``The venue changes and the cause goes on,'' Gingrich said in a  
speech to political supporters shortly before leaving Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich is organizing his political and business affairs,  
having resigned from Congress rather than take the oath of office 
for the term that began last week. 
</P>
<P>
	He will give lectures for five-figure fees, and has also agreed  
to serve on the board of Forstmann Little &AMP; Company. In addition, 
he is likely to attend this winter's gathering of the World 
Economic Forum, a gathering of prominent figures from the world of 
government, business and academia. 
</P>
<P>
	He will maintain one business office in the Atlanta area and  
another in the Washington area. He has a federal political action 
committee, as well as one registered in Georgia, and retains a 
small staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich served 20 years in Congress, representing the region  
around Atlanta. He retired as one of the best-known political 
figures in America -- and one of the most divisive, to judge by the 
polls -- and has never run statewide at home in Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy Barnes, a Democrat, was elected governor in November for a  
four-year term, the latest in a line of Democrats to hold the post 
stretching back to the middle of the 19th century. 
</P>
<P>
	But one official familiar with Gingrich's thinking noted that he  
is roughly the age Ronald Reagan was when he was first elected 
governor of California in 1966 -- and his entire presidency still 
lay ahead.

<HEADLINE> Old Military Bases Being Converted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AYER, Mass. (AP) -- Hundreds of identical ranch houses, lined up  
like soldiers at attention, stand eerily vacant along a road at 
Fort Devens where tanks and transport trucks once rolled with 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a reminder of the past, when the Cold War fueled enormous  
defense spending and vast military bases sprawled across the 
country like this one 35 miles outside Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	There is a hint of the future just down the road: Trendy sport  
utility vehicles ferry businessmen to jobs at a software company 
housed in the old base's intelligence headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Now simply named Devens, the former U.S. Army facility -- like  
others closed nationwide since 1988 -- is under civilian ownership. 
The transition was painful at times, but things are looking up. 
</P>
<P>
	The old army fort, which once employed 7,000 people, boasts 39  
businesses and 1,300 private-sector jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things were real bad for a year,'' said Corey Austin, who  
works at the Exxon service station in nearby Ayer. ``Now, they've 
taken up the entire work force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to a Defense Department Web site, 20 of the 97 bases  
slated for closure across the country have successfully been 
converted to civilian use. The government estimated last April that 
some 45,000 new jobs have been created in the abandoned hulks. 
</P>
<P>
	What used to be Fort Benjamin Harrison in Lawrence, Ind., is now  
a state park. Wurtsmith Air Force Base in Oscoda, Mich., has 
produced 1,000 new jobs and is planning to create a retirement and 
vacation community. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than two years after it closed, Mather Air Force Base in  
Sacramento, Calif., became a civilian airport and the region's air 
cargo hub. And Packard Bell NEC moved into the former Sacramento 
Army Depot, where 5,000 people now manufacture computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Success has been good, except the redevelopment process has  
usually taken longer than anticipated,'' said James Noone, partner 
in the Washington-based Karalekas &AMP; Noone, a law firm specializing 
in communities trying to redevelop bases. 
</P>
<P>
	While a number of former bases have become civilian airports,  
others found creative ways to use space. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, up to 120,000 rock fans pitched multicolored tents on  
the runway at the former Plattsburg Air Force Base in New York to 
watch the band Phish. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the last two years, huge Phish concerts at the former  
Loring Air Force Base in Limestone, Maine, have pumped millions of 
dollars into the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Converting old bases is often slowed by the expensive and  
frustrating process of cleaning up after the military -- which 
leaves behind unexploded shells, asbestos and plain old trash. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, cleanup and other transition costs ate up much of the  
savings originally made from the several rounds of base closures 
since the 1980s. The Defense Department now estimates closures 
saved $3.7 billion in fiscal 1999 and will save $14 billion through 
2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the challenges of the older facilities is that the  
redevelopment costs are huge,'' said Michael Hogan, head of 
MassDevelopment, the agency redeveloping Devens. 
</P>
<P>
	Fearing economic devastation, base communities strongly opposed  
plans to begin downsizing in 1988, when the first closures were 
announced. Congress has balked at ordering more bases shut down. 
</P>
<P>
	Pease Air Force Base on New Hampshire's seacoast was one of the  
first bases to close its gates, during a deep regional recession in 
the early 1990s. It has since been transformed as a thriving 
industrial park where Pan Am recently took up residence, joining 80 
other businesses and a wildlife refuge. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Morgan, town planner in nearby Newington, attributes the old  
base's success to a strong local economy. ``The rising tide makes 
all the boats float,'' he said. ``Even Pease floated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A rising tide in Denver also lifted the fortunes of both the  
rich and the poor at Lowry Air Force Base. There, the Colorado 
Coalition for the Homeless now operates 170 housing units on the 
old base, right next to $400,000 houses being constructed. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than creating an economic blight, the shutdown of Lowry  
may have actually turned out to have been a boon to Denver, giving 
the city more room to expand with roads, schools and senior 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's actually pretty amazing, the amount of activity,'' said  
John Parvensky, the coalition's director.

	VERY HAPPY RETURNS: If you're still debating whether to return  
that dreadful shirt your aunt gave you for the holidays, and it's 
past the store's deadline for refunds, go ahead and take it back. 
Consumer Reports magazine in its January issue reports that all of 
its undercover shoppers got cash refunds even though they took the 
merchandise back to shops several days after the deadline. The 
magazine found the biggest obstacle to a return was the lack of a 
sales receipt. But if you've thrown away the original packaging, 
you stand a good chance of still getting your money back. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	NOT AS BAD AS YOU'D THINK: Drivers trying to navigate the  
busiest parts of financial centers like New York or San Francisco 
might be surprised to find that compared to Frankfurt, Germany, 
traffic in the U.S. cities is a breeze. DHL Worldwide clocked how 
long it took its couriers to complete a trip of about 3 miles 
through the central business areas of big cities around the world. 
It took couriers 17.5 minutes to make the trip in New York and 21 
minutes in San Francisco, while in Frankfurt, the trek took 53 
minutes. Couriers managed surprisingly short trips in London, at 13 
minutes, and Paris, at 15. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
	TRYING TO MAKE THE GRADE: It's getting harder to compete for the  
highest ratings in travel guides, according to Mobil, which reports 
that the number of U.S. establishments with four-star ratings in 
its guides has fallen to 372 in 1999 from 405 in 1998. Mobil 
attributed the drop to the fact that the standards for excellence 
are rising among restaurants and lodging establishments. But Mobil 
did report that the number of establishments earning its highest 
rating, five stars, did rise by six to 44 this year.

	SO YOU DON'T END UP BURNING MONEY: HouseMaster, a home  
inspection company, offers some advice on how to cut the cost of 
heating your home. First, installing a more sophisticated 
thermostat to control the heating system should go far toward 
reducing your energy expenses. Keeping your furnace working 
efficiently, taking steps such as cleaning or changing filters, 
will also help. But if you're away from the house, you shouldn't 
leave it totally unheated; your water pipes could burst and leave 
you with extensive damage.

<HEADLINE> Ravens Interview Jaguars' Palmer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OWINGS MILLS, Md. (AP) -- Say this much about Chris Palmer: He  
certainly is familiar with the Baltimore Ravens. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, who interviewed for the team's head coaching job  
Tuesday, is offensive coordinator of the Jacksonville Jaguars and 
therefore studied plenty of film on the Ravens over the past two 
years. The Jaguars went 4-0 against Baltimore during that span 
while averaging 31.5 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Palmer was quarterbacks coach with New England when the  
Patriots pinned a 46-38 defeat on the Ravens. A few years earlier, 
Palmer got acquainted with the AFC Central as receivers coach of 
the Houston Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having spent three years in Houston and two years in  
Jacksonville, I'm familiar with all the teams in the division. 
That's a plus for me,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer spent nearly 10 hours at the Ravens' practice facility.  
He spoke with owner Art Modell, director of player personnel Ozzie 
Newsome and David Modell, the Ravens' vice president of marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore is one of four NFL teams currently searching for a new  
head coach. Art Modell has expressed a desire to speak with 
Minnesota Vikings offensive coordinator Brian Billick, but 
Baltimore can't conduct a formal interview until the Vikings are 
out of the playoffs -- a process that could take up to three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, 49, may not be available by then because he has another  
interview lined up (with a team he would not disclose). He said the 
Ravens did not offer him the job Tuesday but that time was a 
factor. 
</P>
<P>
	``They know there's another situation that's coming to a head  
for me that I have to make a decision on pretty quickly,'' Palmer 
said. ``Hopefully tomorrow my wife and I will be able to reflect on 
things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So, the Ravens must decide whether to bide their time or make an  
offer to either Palmer or one of two other assistant coaches who 
have already interviewed for the vacancy created by the Dec. 28 
firing of Ted Marchibroda. 
</P>
<P>
	At that time, Art Modell said the Ravens hoped to have a new  
coach in place shortly after the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our timetable remains the same,'' David Modell said Tuesday  
evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer is the second coach in two days to tour the Ravens'  
practice facility and view game film with team officials. 
Pittsburgh Steelers defensive coordinator Jim Haslett, who also is 
quite familiar with the Ravens, went through the process Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know this football team because we've played them every  
year,'' said Haslett, whose Steelers limited Baltimore to one 
touchdown in two games this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ravens have also interviewed Philadelphia Eagles defensive  
coordinator Emmitt Thomas, who is considered a longshot to get the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore originally wanted either George Seifert or Mike  
Holmgren, both of whom have already established themselves as 
outstanding NFL head coaches. But Seifert quickly signed with 
Carolina and Holmgren canceled a planned trip to Baltimore after 
accepting a job with the Seattle Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ravens finished 6-10 this season despite yielding less than  
17 points in half their games. The offense, however, finished 14th 
in the 15-team AFC in total yardage and topped 20 points on only 
five occasions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the defense is very, very solid, maybe better than  
some of the teams that are in the playoffs,'' Palmer said. ``Now 
it's a question of being able to score more points and doing some 
things to keep the defense off the field.''

<HEADLINE> Saddam Becomes More Agressive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has adopted a  
much more aggressive posture in recent weeks by nearly doubling the 
number of mobile surface-to-air missile sites in the northern and 
southern no-fly zones and using them to threaten U.S. and British 
planes. 
</P>
<P>
	As well, the Iraqi leader has sent warplanes into the two  
off-limit zones at least 66 times in the past two weeks, said a 
senior defense official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iraqi aircraft also seem to be employing tactics aimed at  
entrapping the U.S. and British warplanes keeping watch over most 
of Iraqi airspace, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of just one or two aircraft darting in and out of the  
no-fly zones in a cat-and-mouse game, U.S. and British warplanes 
now are being harassed by several aircraft at the same time -- such 
as an armed helicopter and a fighter plane, the official. 
</P>
<P>
	``Iraq previously used no-fly zone violations as a lure,'' the  
official said. ``Now, they seem to be used as a distraction,'' 
while other Iraqi planes approach from a different angle. This also 
may bring the allied aircraft within range of Saddam's 
anti-aircraft missile batteries. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's becoming much more aggressive'' with the type of tactics  
his military is employing, said the official, who has access to 
intelligence reports about the conditions U.S. and British aircraft 
face in the no-fly zones. 
</P>
<P>
	The northern no-fly zone was set up in 1991 north of the 36th  
parallel to keep Saddam from attacking Kurds with his aircraft. The 
southern zone was set up in 1992 to protect southern Shiite 
Muslims, and prohibit attacks against Iraq's southern neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the U.S. and British air attacks against Iraq in  
mid-December, the nine surface-to-air missile sites in the no-fly 
zones have increased to 17, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	The exact size of his arsenal isn't entirely clear, but the  
Iraqi leader is known to have some 110 operational missile 
launchers. U.S. officials said Tuesday they have been unable to 
account for 13 of those. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to the Persian Gulf War, Saddam had amassed about 7,000  
surface-to-air anti-aircraft missiles, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Saddam's surface-to-air missile batteries are mobile,  
and therefore nearly impossible to detect until they turn on their 
radar. In defense, U.S. and British aircraft fire anti-radiation 
missiles, which follow the radar beam to its source to destroy the 
missile battery. 
</P>
<P>
	In at least 12 cases in recent weeks, Iraqis have aimed missiles  
at the coalition aircraft, but often without turning on their radar 
so that the Iraqi sites can't be targeted. 
</P>
<P>
	No U.S. or British aircraft have been harmed in the latest  
encounters. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest confrontation early Tuesday, an F-16CJ patrolling  
the northern no-fly zone near Mosul encountered an active radar 
site, and fired a HARM anti-radiation missile at it. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Air Force aircraft returned to its base in Incirlik,  
Turkey, unharmed, and it is still unclear whether the missile took 
out the radar, said Pentagon spokesman Capt. Michael Doubleday. 
</P>
<P>
	Doubleday acknowledged the situation is far different now, in  
comparison to that in December, when the Iraqis put up no 
resistance to the four days of U.S. and British air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Iraqi approach has changed. Our reactions have been  
appropriate and responsive to the provocations,'' Doubleday said. 
'' What's changed in the last several weeks, is a decision 
evidently of Saddam Hussein, to challenge the no-fly zones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added that Iraq's ``overall goal'' is to ``get rid of all  
restrictions on Iraq, such as the sanctions imposed by the United 
Nations in the wake of the Persian Gulf War, and the inspections 
geared towards curbing Iraq's development of weapons of mass 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter what Saddam's intent, the spokesman added, the United  
States will continue to enforce the no-fly zones and take 
appropriate action to defend its air crews.

<HEADLINE> Record German Trade Surplus Seen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIESBADEN, Germany (AP) -- Germany had a $9.88 billion trade  
surplus in November, putting itself in position to post a record 
surplus for 1998, the Federal Statistics Office said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some economists had expected the month's trade surplus to shrink  
from October's $7.46 billion, fearing the impact from weaker 
exports resulting from economic instability overseas, particularly 
in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	That impact is expected to slow the German economy, but won't  
show up until later in 1999, said Gertrud Traud, economist at Bank 
Julius Baer in Frankfurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Asia's financial crisis hasn't become visible yet. That won't  
happen until this year,'' Traud said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most forward-looking economic indicators -- such as growth  
predictions and manufacturing orders -- pointed to a worsening 
economy, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest economic prediction from a major German research  
institute put growth in 1999 at 1.4 percent, half that of 1998's 
2.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In related economic news, Germany imported less in November --  
$39 billion versus $42 billion in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Exports from January to November totaled $515.62 billion, up  
from $479.82 billion for the same period of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 trade surplus is set to surpass 1989's record of $79.58  
billion when government statistics for December are tabulated next 
month.

<HEADLINE> Packers Could Have 3 Black Coaches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Ray Rhodes, the first black coach in the  
Green Bay Packers' 80-year history, will bring defensive 
coordinator Emmitt Thomas with him from Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	He's also offered to keep Sherm Lewis as offensive coordinator  
if he doesn't land a head coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
	If Lewis returns, it would mark the first time an NFL team had  
three blacks atop its coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers are on the vanguard of diversity in a league where  
70 percent of players but only three head coaches are black. 
</P>
<P>
	When Mike Holmgren arrived seven seasons ago, he made NFL  
history by hiring Rhodes and Lewis, the first time there ever had 
been two black coordinators on the same team. 
</P>
<P>
	Team president Bob Harlan said race has been ignored, not  
highlighted, in hiring decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't something we were aiming for,'' Harlan said Tuesday.  
``When Mike came here seven years ago and hired Ray and Sherm, that 
was quite a change, certainly for Green Bay. But it's always been 
the case of who's the best man out there?'' 
</P>
<P>
	When general manager Ron Wolf was searching for a new coach,  
``he never sat and discussed color with me at all,'' Harlan said. 
``He was looking for the best man and I'm sure that's the way Ray 
is going about selecting his staff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf said he recognized Rhodes' hiring was momentous but that  
race never was a factor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ray Rhodes is the coach,'' Wolf said. ``I don't think those  
other things enter into it. That's just a little piece of history 
for the Green Bay Packers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf also reiterated that he felt no pressure to hire a black  
coach. ``Race was not a factor,'' he said. ``And we need to erase 
that idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But make no mistake, the Packers are knocking down racial  
barriers. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas was Rhodes' defensive coordinator all of his four seasons  
in Philadelphia. Like Lewis, his name is brought up every offseason 
when the coaching carousel starts spinning, and he recently 
interviewed with Baltimore for its vacancy. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas will replace Fritz Shurmur, who likely will join Holmgren  
in Seattle. Shurmur joined the Packers in 1994 after Rhodes 
returned to San Francisco following two years as Holmgren's 
defensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis has interviewed with the Chicago Bears about their head  
coaching job. It's only the second interview he's gotten despite 
glowing credentials. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren and Minnesota coach Dennis Green have said Lewis is the  
most qualified assistant in football. Wolf wanted a man with head 
coaching experience to smooth the transition, however, and that 
left Lewis out again. 
</P>
<P>
	But if Lewis joins Rhodes' staff, he would be in charge of  
calling plays, something Holmgren almost always did. 
</P>
<P>
	Harlan said Lewis could help his head coaching chances by  
returning to Green Bay rather than following Holmgren to Seattle or 
Andy Reid to Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be his offense,'' Harlan said. ``As long as he's with  
Mike, there's always the question, is it his offense or Mike's? 
Even with Andy Reid, he'd be in that same situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he comes here, Ray clearly stated that it's his offense to  
run. Two or three years of a productive offense, and you don't know 
what that may do for his head coaching chances down the line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive leader LeRoy Butler, who was a strong advocate of  
Lewis replacing Holmgren before Rhodes became available, said both 
the Packers and Lewis would benefit by his return. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not in Mike Holmgren's shadow anymore,'' Butler said.  
``He will be visible, he will be on the sidelines, he will be able 
to talk to Brett (Favre) when Brett comes off. He will be able to 
call the plays. He will be able to get into the shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will be able to do everything he wants to do the West Coast  
offense. And everybody will know this.''

<HEADLINE> Botha Knows What's Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Francois Botha knows what's expected of him.  
</P>
<P>
	He's supposed to be the legitimate victim for Mike Tyson in  
Tyson's first fight since he bit Evander Holyfield's ears on June 
28, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't want another Peter McNeeley,'' said Shelley Finkel,  
Tyson's boxing adviser. ``Botha is credible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNeeley didn't get through the first round in Tyson's first  
fight after his release from prison in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Botha also is relatively unknown despite a 39-1 record and a  
brief stay as the IBF heavyweight champion. He is well aware this 
fight can bring the kind of recognition that has escaped him in a 
pro career that began in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a huge fight,'' said the 30-year-old South African,  
who has lived in the United States for nine years. ``I believe that 
they bit off more than they could chew with Francois Botha. No pun 
intended.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson was an 8-1 favorite.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a sore loser,'' Botha said Tuesday. ``I've got a great  
chin and I'm ready to fight. I can't be intimidated. I won't be 
intimidated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Botha won the IBF crown on a unanimous decision over Axel Schulz  
of Germany on Dec. 9, 1995. However, he tested positive for steroid 
use. At first, the IBF ordered a rematch but then withdrew 
championship recognition. 
</P>
<P>
	``They found a trace of a steroid,'' Botha said. ``The steroid  
was in medication a doctor had given me for a right-arm injury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Botha called the loss of the title ``devastating.''  
</P>
<P>
	``We had a contract to fight Mike Tyson four years ago,'' he  
said. ``I lost a lot of money then and the opportunity to prove 
what I'm trying to prove now. I had to start all over again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the time he was stripped of the title, Botha was promoted by  
Don King, as was Tyson. Neither is now. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Moorer won the vacant title on points against Schulz. On  
Nov. 9, 1996 in Las Vegas, Moorer defended the title against Botha 
and stopped him in the 12th round. 
</P>
<P>
	Botha admits he fought poorly that night. That plus the fact he  
has fought less then two full rounds (two first-round knockouts) in 
19 months probably accounts for why he was selected to fight Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
	Botha had a successful amateur career in South Africa before  
turning pro in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	After winning his first two fights in South Africa, Botha came  
to the United States, and most of his fights have been in this 
country. The first was a four-round decision over Joe Adams in 1990 
at Biloxi, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I first came to the United States I really had to  
struggle,'' Botha recalled. ``I has $1,200 in my pocket.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His purse for Saturday's fight is $1.94 million.  
</P>
<P>
	Botha lives at Newport Beach, Calif., with his wife Elsje and  
their son Marcel and daughter Cecilia. He is the process of 
becoming a U.S. citizen.

<HEADLINE> Magazine Interviews Rose McGowan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Marilyn Manson, the shock rocker who likes to  
wear fishnet stockings, lipstick and fake breasts, can be cool and 
collected when he wants. Take it from his girlfriend, Rose McGowan. 
</P>
<P>
	The actress told February's Moveline magazine that what she  
likes most about Manson is his ``sense of calm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm centered, but in a way that a spinning top is centered,  
with its point on the ground and its body going in circles,'' said 
the ``Scream'' star. ``He's a lot more patient.''

<P>
	Curious how El Nino stacks up against Tiger? Just ask Mark  
O'Meara, who is fast becoming the pied piper of Generation X. 
</P>
<P>
	The friendship between O'Meara and Tiger Woods began about five  
years ago when they played a practice round together during the Bay 
Hill Invitational. Woods was only 17 at the time, but O'Meara knew 
he would be a special player. 
</P>
<P>
	Late last month, British Amateur champion Sergio Garcia was in  
south Florida for the Orange Bowl Classic when ``El Nino'' arranged 
for a practice round with O'Meara at Isleworth. They first met at 
the Trophy Lancome in France. 
</P>
<P>
	``Talent-wise, I played with Tiger when he was 17, compared to  
Sergio who is 18 ... there's just not many Tiger Woods who come 
along,'' O'Meara said. ``Sergio Garcia is a fine player, but I 
don't think he is (another Woods) at this stage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia will play Augusta National because he won the British  
Amateur, and he is expected to turn professional as soon as the 
Masters is over. He is regarded by many as Europe's best prospect, 
a dashing Spaniard cut from the mold of Seve Ballesteros and Jose 
Maria Olazabal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Will he do what Tiger did? I kind of doubt it,'' O'Meara said.  
``Tiger is definitely longer than Sergio, but Sergio has kind of 
got a lot of Seve in him. He's got a lot of charisma, a lot of 
instincts to play the game. His record is phenomenal. I think he's 
going to do well.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

<P>
	 *MICHAEL AND FRIENDS:* The highlight of Michael Douglas' career  
-- as a golfer, not an actor or producer -- came last fall during the 
pro-am of the Dunhill Cup when he shot an 80 at St. Andrews while 
paired with John Daly. 
</P>
<P>
	The next one likely will take place this spring, when he plays  
with eight other movie stars in the ``Michael Douglas and Friends 
Celebrity Golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nine-hole tournament, a scramble format on the new Pete  
Dye-designed Ocean Trails Golf Course in Palos Verdes, Calif., will 
take place the week of the Academy Awards and will be televised by 
ABC Sports from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. on the Sunday of the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those committed to play are Kevin Costner, Samuel L.  
Jackson, Sean Connery and Jack Nicholson. If they need help, swing 
coaches David Leadbetter, Butch Harmon and Jack Flick will be with 
each group. 
</P>
<P>
	``We better have an entertaining format, because it's not going  
to be about our golf games,'' said Douglas, who has a 17-handicap. 
</P>
<P>
	Proceeds from the tournament, which is presented by Mazda, will  
benefit the Motion Picture &AMP; Television Fund, which is a relief 
account for those in the industry who have fallen on hard times. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea came from Terry Jastrow, president of Jack Nicklaus  
Productions which stages Shell's Wonderful World of Golf, among 
other things. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get into fundraising, it's limited what you can do,''  
Douglas said Tuesday. ``There are a plethora of golf events around, 
but this seemed to be one that was painless and profitable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas compared the event to the old Bing Crosby affair at  
Pebble Beach, which is now known as the AT&AMP;T Classic -- only without 
the pros. He expects it to raise $600,000 in the first year. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DUVAL'S LIMITS:* The 60-degree wedge may be one of the most  
popular new clubs on tour over the past couple of years, but you 
won't find it in David Duval's bag. As far as he's concerned, all 
it does is bring double bogey into the equation. 
</P>
<P>
	And does Duval ever hate double bogeys.  
</P>
<P>
	``Doubles are easy,'' he said. ``That's part of the reason I  
don't carry a 60-degree wedge. If I have to hit a 60- or 61-degree 
wedge and open the thing up, do some big swing ... that's not a 
shot I should be trying to hit. You're just not going to pull it 
off very often. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't carry clubs that allow me to do it.''  
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he staggers his wedges to 58 degrees. No amazing flop  
shots for Duval, just eight victories and lots of money. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WESTWOOD NOT WESTWARD:* The 40 percent increase is not enough  
to persuade Lee Westwood to leave Europe for the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people ask me why I don't play far more (in America)  
when they're playing for $3 million a week, but money is not a 
driving force to me,'' Westwood said. ``I don't particularly like 
playing there. Why do something you don't like when you can avoid 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Westwood won in New Orleans last year, but his best success  
comes overseas. He won six times last year, including in New 
Orleans on the PGA Tour, and was fourth in earnings on the world 
money list with $2.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DIVOTS:* PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem said Seve  
Ballesteros has accepted an invitation to play in The Players 
Championship in March. The two-time Masters and three-time British 
Open champion will be inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame the 
week of the TPC. ... Tiger Woods led the world money list in 1998 
with $2,927,946, about $72,000 more than David Duval. ... Scott 
McCarron has signed a three-year deal with Orlimar to play its 
TriMetals and to serve as a key spokesman. ... Shigeki Maruyama, 
who went 5-0 in the Presidents Cup, has received a sponsor's 
exemption to play the Sony Open in Honolulu this week.

	 *(MEANINGLESS) STAT OF THE WEEK:* David Duval set the Mercedes  
Championships scoring record in winning by nine strokes. After one 
event this year, he is second to Vijay Singh in the tour's 
all-around category.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Expected To Retire Tomorrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- For six months, Michael Jordan teased, taunted  
and tantalized a nation awaiting his answer. 
</P>
<P>
	At last, he appears to have one.  
</P>
<P>
	The greatest player in NBA history and the most popular athlete  
since Muhammad Ali is expected to announce his retirement 
Wednesday, a source with close ties to the NBA told The Associated 
Press on Monday night. The Bulls scheduled a news conference for 
noon EST Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	If so, it would be the second time in five years that Jordan has  
walked away from the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew Michael wasn't coming back,'' Bulls free agent Dickey  
Simpkins said today at the team's training site in Deerfield. ``He 
dropped hints last season and last summer that this would probably 
be his last go-around. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ending on top was how he wants to do it and that's about the  
best way you can do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just as with Jordan's first retirement, a number of factors --  
his age, a picture-perfect ending to last season, a fractured 
beginning for this one -- appear to have influenced his decision. 
And just like last time, Jordan could change his mind and return at 
some point. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look forward to seeing him sometime in late March when he  
makes his return again in Market Square Arena,'' Pacers coach Larry 
Bird said. 
</P>
<P>
	But for now, he is expected to once again leave the game that  
bears his indelible mark, leave it when he's at the top, the way he 
said he would. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a man who truly, as far as I'm concerned, is the  
modern day Babe Ruth,'' former NBA great and current Lakers vice 
president Jerry West said recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan did not return a message left on his phone, and Bulls  
owner Jerry Reinsdorf, reached at his Arizona home, said: ``I don't 
have any reaction. I don't have any comments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buzz Peterson, the Appalachian State basketball coach who was  
Jordan's teammate and college roommate at North Carolina, said he 
believes Jordan made up his mind a long time ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I called him this morning and asked him, `What's going on?  
I've got 25 pink slip phone messages here in front of me,'' 
Peterson said. ``He just laughed and said everything's coming out 
now, and everything's being said. I can't confirm what he's going 
to say tomorrow but he feels like he's making the right decision 
for himself and his family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about Jordan's retirement, Bulls spokesman Tim Hallam  
said, ``At this particular time, I can't comment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's retirement also was reported by The New York Times, USA  
Today and The Denver Post. 
</P>
<P>
	His agent, David Falk, said that until Jordan ``announces  
whether he is retiring or returning, anything else is 
speculation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And there's been a considerable amount of that ever since Jordan  
hit the final, thrilling shot in Game 6 of the NBA Finals in Utah 
to lock up the Bulls' sixth championship of the decade. That 
speculation intensified last week, when the NBA players and owners 
reached a settlement to end the six-month lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan turns 36 next month. The five-time league MVP led the NBA  
in scoring 10 times and averaged 31.5 points per game, best in 
league history. 
</P>
<P>
	With NBA players preparing for an abbreviated season to begin  
Feb. 5, Jordan was expected to announce his plans before training 
camps opened Monday. He had been in the Bahamas on vacation, but 
returned to Chicago earlier this week. Another source, who also 
requested anonymity, told the AP that Jordan summoned teammates 
Scottie Pippen and Ron Harper to his home to discuss the team's 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan retired from the Bulls the first time in October 1993,  
saying he accomplished everything he wanted to in basketball and 
planned to devote more time to his family. Instead, he spent 1994 
playing minor league baseball for the Double-A Birmingham Barons, a 
farm team of the Chicago White Sox. The budding outfield prospect 
left baseball in the spring of 1995, rather than get caught up in 
another labor squabble between owners and players, and returned to 
the game he loved. 
</P>
<P>
	While his skills were still considerable, Jordan quickly learned  
he could no longer dominate the game the way he once did. The Bulls 
were knocked out of the postseason in the Eastern Conference 
semifinals by Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	But then, just as he had in every previous offseason, Jordan  
went back to work. He added a nearly unstoppable fadeaway jump shot 
to his arsenal, and after a rigorous weight-training and 
conditioning program, he came back the next season better than 
ever. The Bulls then set off on another three-peat that ended last 
June in Utah with Jordan stealing the ball and making the 
game-clinching shot in the final seconds -- one of the most 
memorable sequences of his memorable career. 
</P>
<P>
	It was precisely the lack of offseason work this past summer  
that made many of Jordan's teammates doubt he would return. 
</P>
<P>
	``He prepares as well as anybody but from all I hear, he's been  
playing golf and going to the Bahamas,'' teammate Steve Kerr said 
recently. ``Unless he's working out in a hidden gym somewhere down 
in the Bahamas, I don't think he's really preparing to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan had always vowed to leave the game on top, and in private  
moments, he would confide that watching Willie Mays stagger under 
fly balls long after his skills faded was a powerful lesson. 
</P>
<P>
	There were several other factors that may have weighed on his  
decision. Jordan feuded with general manager Jerry Krause for years 
and, at the end of the last season, when Phil Jackson said he 
wouldn't return, Jordan said he wouldn't play for another coach. 
</P>
<P>
	During the summer, the Bulls hired former Iowa State coach Tim  
Floyd and introduced him at a news conference as the team's vice 
president for basketball operations. But Floyd, a longtime favorite 
of Krause, was widely thought to be the coach-in-waiting, and his 
hiring may have further aggravated Jordan's relationship with the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	For whatever reason, his decision to retire leaves the NBA in  
the lurch. Coming off a divisive labor fight that left fans more 
apathetic than angry, Jordan was the one drawing card that could 
have helped the league regain its popularity. 
</P>
<P>
	He refused to be labeled the league's caretaker, but when he  
came back the first time, Jordan said it was partly because he 
wanted to teach some of the younger players how to comport 
themselves -- both on the court and off. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's finished, we're the ones who are at a loss, the fans  
who enjoyed him and the players who played with him and against 
him,'' Suns owner Jerry Colangelo said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do believe the game is very resilient. Having been in the  
league for 32 years, I've seen us at different cycles, up and down. 
I've seen a concern about who is going to replace stars at that 
time. Thank goodness there have been new players to take the places 
of the great stars of the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, Colangelo added, ``Recognize that he is by himself when you  
talk about great stars, but somewhere beyond the NBA today there 
will be some players to come who will be great players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether there will be another with Jordan's worldwide appeal,  
though, remains to be seen. After Magic Johnson and Bird helped 
lift pro basketball's profile in the early 1980s, Jordan took it to 
the next level almost single-handedly. 
</P>
<P>
	He also took the game itself above the rim, inspiring the  
generation of players who followed him to devise more and more 
spectacular moves. Every night of the NBA season yielded a bonanza 
of highlight-reel clips and when they were packaged on sports 
programs, the league's popularity soared along with the players. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan also pulled players salaries into the stratosphere as  
well. He made more than $30 million in each of the last two seasons 
and players like Shaquille O'Neal and Kevin Garnett rode his 
coattails to secure $100 million deals. 
</P>
<P>
	Last June, Fortune magazine totaled what it called ``The Jordan  
Effect,'' putting his impact on the economy, since joining the NBA 
in 1984, at $10 billion. It calculated he sold an extra $165 
million in tickets for the league, and delivered an extra $366 
million in revenue, mostly in added TV money and the sale of 
merchandise such as jerseys, hats and posters. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike, among the most prominent of the dozen or so companies who  
hired him as an endorser, has sold more than $2.6 billion in 
Jordan-related products. At the start of his career, the Bulls 
averaged only 6,365 fans per game. In his third season, the team 
began a string of sellouts that reached 542 consecutive games.

<HEADLINE> MediaNews, Donrey Papers Make Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- MediaNews Group Inc. will take control of 10  
Donrey Media Group daily newspapers in California under a deal 
announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	William Dean Singleton's MediaNews said its Garden State  
Newspapers subsidiary will merge 10 of its California newspapers 
with the Donrey newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal expands MediaNews' presence in Northern California and  
in the greater Los Angeles market, where it already owns the Daily 
News of Los Angeles, Press-Telegram of Long Beach and three papers 
in the San Gabriel Valley east of downtown Los Angeles. The Daily 
News and Press-Telegram are not included in the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	MediaNews, based in Denver, also owns The Denver Post and 37  
other daily newspapers in 13 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Garden State Newspapers will own two-thirds of the new group and  
Donrey will own one-third. MediaNews will manage the group, which 
will publish 20 daily newspapers with a daily circulation of about 
531,000 and a Sunday circulation of about 493,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, which is expected to close Feb. 1, did not involve  
cash, Singleton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We took our marbles, they took their marbles, and we jumbled  
them all up. It's a true merger into a partnership,'' Singleton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Donrey daily newspapers in the deal are the Inland Valley  
Daily Bulletin of Ontario, the Vallejo Times-Herald, the Chico 
Enterprise-Record, The Hemet News, The Daily Democrat of Woodland, 
The Lompoc Record, the Ukiah Daily Journal, the Daily News of Red 
Bluff, the Oroville Mercury Register and the Redlands Daily Facts. 
</P>
<P>
	Also included are Donrey's nondaily Advocate-News of Fort Bragg  
and The Valley Times of Moreno Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	The Garden State Newspapers include the San Gabriel Valley  
Tribune of West Covina, The Whittier Daily News, the Star-News of 
Pasadena, The Oakland Tribune, The Daily Review of Hayward, the 
Tri-Valley Herald of Pleasanton, The Argus of Fremont, The Alameda 
Times-Star, The San Mateo County Times, and the Times-Standard of 
Eureka, plus 23 nondaily newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Inland Valley Daily Bulletin, Donrey's second-largest paper,  
has a circulation area adjoining that of Garden State's West 
Covina, Whittier and Pasadena papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Donrey, headquartered in Fort Smith, Ark., is owned by Stephens  
Group Inc. of Little Rock, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	``Donrey is owned by an investor who understands the marketing  
and operational opportunities in forming this California 
partnership,'' said Singleton, the chief executive of MediaNews. 
``While all of these newspapers are good newspapers on a 
stand-alone basis, operating together they will provide important 
new synergies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Donrey continues to own 14 other newspapers in eight states,  
including the Las Vegas Review Journal, and newspapers in Arkansas, 
North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Oklahoma, Washington and Hawaii. 
It also owns an outdoor advertising company and KOLO-TV in Reno, 
Nev. Last July, Donrey sold 28 newspapers to Community Newspaper 
Holdings Inc. of Birmingham, Ala.

	Air Jordan To Retire This Week  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Michael Jordan plans to announce his retirement  
Wednesday, a source with close ties to the NBA told The Associated 
Press on Monday night. If so, it would be the second time in five 
years that the greatest player in NBA history and the most popular 
athlete since Muhammad Ali walked away from the game. There had 
been considerable speculation about Jordan's future ever since he 
hit the final, thrilling shot in Game 6 of the NBA Finals in Utah 
to lock up the Bulls sixth championship of the decade. That 
speculation intensified last week, when the NBA players and owners 
reached a settlement to end the six-month lockout.

	U.S. To Propose Open Spaces Plan  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the second major environmental initiative  
in as many days, the Clinton administration is proposing to triple 
spending to preserve vulnerable lands -- from buying new parkland to 
rescuing erosion-threatened beaches. President Clinton planned to 
unveil the $1 billion spending proposal Tuesday as a bold stroke to 
``save America's natural treasures.'' The ``land-legacy 
initiative'' -- to be included in the fiscal 2000 budget Clinton 
will send to Congress next week -- calls for adding thousands of 
acres to the system of federally protected lands and provide states 
with nearly $600 million for land preservation, officials said.

	Microsoft's 1st Witness Testifies  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft's first witness in its antitrust  
trial told the judge the company does not wield monopoly power over 
the world's market for computer operating systems, a crucial 
dispute with important implications for a verdict. Richard 
Schmalensee, who once served on President Bush's Council of 
Economic Advisers, testified that Microsoft faces competition in 
the high-tech industry from rivals, software pirates and its own 
customers reluctant to upgrade to new versions.

<P>
	Clinton Denies High Crimes  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and House Republicans  
clashed in impeachment trial papers Monday, the White House 
claiming perjury and obstruction allegations fall short of high 
crimes and misdemeanors and GOP lawmakers rebutting: ``If this is 
not enough, what is?'' Clinton denied ``each and every allegation'' 
in the House-passed articles of impeachment. The House, in papers 
filed a few hours later with the Senate, insisted the evidence 
against the nation's 42nd president ``overwhelmingly supports both 
charges,'' perjury and obstruction of justice. 

</P>
<P>
	Steel Industry Faces Hurdles  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Disappointed at President Clinton's refusal to  
take stronger action to block cheap steel imports, the president of 
the largest steelworkers union says he'll look for help in 
Congress. Lawmakers from steel-producing states stand ready to aid 
a union that contributed more than $1 million to congressional 
campaigns since 1997. But even the most ardent supporters 
acknowledge that success will be difficult and may come too late to 
be useful. Sen. Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia, the Democratic 
chairman of the Senate steel caucus, said lawmakers from the 16 
states that produce steel are not numerous enough to overcome a 
propensity toward free-trade policies.

<P>
	State Dinner Breaks Into Tango  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton rolled up the White House's  
rugs Monday night for a demonstration of the tango by Robert 
Duvall. Known for his rugged acting, Duvall found himself 
performing at a state dinner for Argentine President Carlos Menem, 
who had said he wanted to experience things un-Argentinian during 
his visit, but he was intrigued at the idea of seeing the tango in 
the White House.

	U.S. Blood Supply Dwindles  
</P>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Some hospitals postponed elective surgery as  
severe winter weather worsened the nation's usual post-holiday 
blood shortage, the Red Cross said Monday. Blood banks are seeking 
donors. A stockpile of three or four days' worth of blood is 
typical, but half of America's blood banks have less than a one-day 
supply. Types O-negative and O-positive are most in demand because 
they are so common. 

</P>
<P>
	Tokyo Stocks Close Lower  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stock prices closed lower Tuesday. The Nikkei  
shed 7.51 points to close at 13,360.97. In New York Monday, the Dow 
fell 23.43 to 9,619.89.

<P>
	Senators 4, Devils 2  
</P>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Daniel Alfredsson broke a tie early  
in the third period and the Ottawa Senators extended their 
franchise-record unbeaten streak to nine games with a 4-2 win over 
the New Jersey Devils on Monday night. Alexei Yashin, Andreas 
Johansson and Marian Hossa also scored as Ottawa won its fourth 
straight and extended its current streak to 7-0-2. Damian Rhodes, 
who shut out New Jersey on Jan. 2, had 20 saves.

<HEADLINE> Photos Ahead in Deadly Gondola Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- Jurors will see just three photos of a  
crumpled Italian ski gondola, not the more than 50 that prosecutors 
requested, when the courts-martial of two Marine aviators begins, a 
military judge ruled Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Both were charged with 20 counts of involuntary manslaughter and  
negligent homicide after their EA-6B Prowler jet hit a cable 
supporting the gondola near Cavalese, Italy, Feb. 3 and killed 20 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Col. Robert Nunley said jurors will see three photos of the  
flattened gondola, some of which show blood and bodies. But the 
photos are not as graphic as others that prosecutors wanted to 
introduce. 
</P>
<P>
	``My greatest fear is the members (jurors) will convict because  
20 people died, not because of negligence,'' Nunley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors also will not see photos of the victims when they were  
alive. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Richard Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., the pilot,  
and Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury, N.Y., the navigator, 
are scheduled to be tried in separate proceedings next month at 
Camp Lejeune. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors argued Monday that jurors need to see the pictures  
of the wreckage and bodies to fully understand the case. Defense 
lawyers said the photos had little value as evidence and would only 
shock the jury.

<HEADLINE> Producer Prices Rise 0.4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A stunning 30.7 percent jump in prices charged  
by cigarette companies pushed up producer prices overall by a brisk 
0.4 percent in December. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the biggest monthly increase in 14 months, but wasn't  
enough to prevent the Labor Department's Producer Price Index from 
declining in 1998 for the second year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices fell 0.1 percent last year after plunging 1.2 percent in  
1997, the sharpest drop in 11 years. That marked the first 
back-to-back annual decline in the index since the government began 
compiling it in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
	For much of the year, including December, falling or flat energy  
and food prices have helped offset modest inflation in other goods. 
But, in December, that wasn't enough to offset the tobacco rise. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tobacco prices are soaring to pay for the settlement with  
attorneys' general in many states,'' said economist Donald 
Ratajczak of Georgia State University. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy prices fell 2.3 percent in December, on top of a 1.2  
percent drop in November. Food prices edged 0.1 percent lower, also 
the second consecutive decline. Goods other than food and energy, 
so-called core prices, jumped 1 percent in December, the most in 12 
years. However, excluding tobacco, they fell 0.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, released late Tuesday, was not scheduled for release  
until Wednesday morning. However, it was inadvertently posted early 
on the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Internet site. This is the 
second such early release of market-sensitive data via the 
Internet. The last time came in November, with jobs data. 
</P>
<P>
	William Parks, special assistant to Bureau of Labor Statistics  
Commissioner Katharine Abraham, said the latest release was the 
result of ``an internal computer system error.'' The earlier 
release involved human error, he said, and new procedures 
implemented after it are working well. 
</P>
<P>
	The Producer Price Index measures prices charged by producers  
such as factories and food-processing plants for finished goods. 
Earlier in the production process, prices fell 0.6 percent for 
intermediate goods and 3.8 percent for crude goods. An example of 
the three processing stages are bread for finished, flour for 
intermediate and wheat for crude. 
</P>
<P>
	However, economists are anticipating that price declines this  
year eventually will give way to slightly rising prices as the 
world economy begins to recover and demand picks up. 
</P>
<P>
	Falling world demand is behind the steep price drops for oil and  
agricultural commodities. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy prices plunged 12.1 percent in 1998 following a 6.4  
percent drop in 1997. Food prices edged 0.1 percent lower for the 
year, on top of an 0.8 percent decline in 1997. Prices for goods 
other than food and energy rose 2.4 percent last year after showing 
no change the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, sharp currency devaluations, primarily in Asia, lowered  
the prices on imported manufactured goods, including computers and 
cars. However, a shift in the value of the dollar from an 
eight-year high in August, versus the Japanese yen, to a 28-month 
low on Monday, may keep import prices from falling further. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prices will firm in 1999 as the world economy stabilizes, but  
I don't think they'll rise to any significant degree,'' said 
economist Mark Zandi of Regional Financial Associates in West 
Chester, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	A Labor Department report on prices paid by consumers is  
scheduled for release Thursday.

<HEADLINE>  Stage Set for Impeachment Drama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's spokesman today dismissed  
the House Republicans' brief for the impeachment trial as an 
overblown account that ``reads like a cheap mystery.'' The White 
House will offer its own next installment on Wednesday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides filed briefs Monday that blended arguments over  
Clinton's guilt or innocence with predictions of how the case would 
influence future judgments of presidential misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spokesman Joe Lockhart focused today on what he called  
the House's ``constantly shifting'' version of the charges and its 
reliance on ``hyperbole and overblown rhetoric.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It reads like a cheap mystery,'' he said of the brief laying  
out the House case for the Senate trial. ``The discussions about 
sinister plots is something you would expect to read in a novel 
rather than in a document by the House of Representatives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At one point in the lengthy House brief, lawmaker-prosecutors  
argue that evidence and testimony must be viewed as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
	``Events and words that may seem innocent or even exculpatory in  
a vacuum may well take on a sinister, or even criminal connotation 
when observed in the context of the whole plot,'' the House said. 
</P>
<P>
	The brief used as an example Monica Lewinsky's statement that  
``No one ever told me to lie; nobody ever promised me a job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When considered alone this would seem exculpatory,'' the brief  
said. ``However, in the context of other evidence, another picture 
emerges. Of course no one said, 'Now, Monica, you go in there and 
lie.' They didn't have to. Ms. Lewinsky knew what was expected of 
her. Similarly, nobody promised her a job, but once she signed the 
false affidavit, she got one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said the White House's 13-page submission on Monday was  
a formal answer to the Senate summons and a more detailed brief 
would be submitted on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, visiting the National Arboretum to make an  
environmental speech, kept his distance from reporters again today 
-- part of a strategy that Lockhart acknowledged. ``It's 
unproductive right now for the president to get into a long Q&AMP;A on 
this subject,'' the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	In their brief, a road map for oral arguments that begin with  
the House presentation Thursday on the Senate floor, prosecutors 
said that if Clinton is not convicted of the perjury and 
obstruction-of-justice charges, ``the bar will be so high that only 
a convicted felon or a traitor will need to be concerned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, Clinton's lawyers argued that his attempts  
to conceal an extramarital affair with the former White House 
intern ``do not permit the conviction and removal ... of a duly 
elected president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The charges ... do not rise to the level of 'high crimes and  
misdemeanors' as contemplated by the founding fathers,'' the White 
House said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides tried to hone their presentations Monday, knowing  
that the openings will take on an even greater significance if the 
Senate does not allow witnesses later in the trial. Each side has 
24 hours on the clock, with the White House to follow when the 
prosecutors are done. 
</P>
<P>
	Lead prosecutor Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who plans to begin the  
prosecutors' opening presentation, said this was ``not the time to 
get angry with the Senate'' over its decision to delay his demand 
for witnesses. He said the House ``managers'' wouldn't ``want to 
hang our hat just on the question of witnesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Vice President Dan Quayle, in an interview today after a  
foreign policy speech to the conservative Heritage Foundation, said 
Clinton should be removed from office by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``My view is that perjury is a felony. A felony is a serious  
crime and that clearly meets the requirement in the Constitution 
for a high crime and misdemeanor,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore predicted Monday that the Senate would  
not muster the two-thirds vote to convict Clinton. ``What the 
president did was wrong,'' Gore told The Associated Press in an 
interview. ``He's acknowledged that, asked for forgiveness. But 
what he did falls far short'' of misbehavior warranting removal 
from office. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House submission Monday was in answer to a Senate  
summons after the two articles of impeachment approved by the 
House. The House submission was a 105-page trial brief. The White 
House has until Wednesday to counter with its own trial brief 
rebuttal. 
</P>
<P>
	The House called the trial ``a defining moment for the  
presidency as an institution, because if the president is not 
convicted as a consequence of the conduct that has been portrayed, 
then no House of Representatives will ever be able to impeach again 
and no Senate will ever convict. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``How far can the standard be lowered without completely  
compromising the credibility of the office for all time?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a strange sideshow unfolded as Hustler magazine  
publisher Larry Flynt appeared on CNBC and held a news conference 
Monday night to allege hypocrisy in past personal conduct of Rep. 
Bob Barr, R-Ga., one of the 13 House managers presenting the 
impeachment case in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Barr denied Flynt's allegations and said he was  
``deeply saddened'' by them. He added, ``I have steadfastly worked 
throughout the impeachment debate to focus attention on substantive 
issues like perjury and obstruction of justice, and away from lurid 
personal allegations.''

<HEADLINE> Lands' End To Cut Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DODGEVILLE, Wis. (AP) -- Lands' End Inc. is closing three outlet  
stores and cutting more than 10 percent of its salaried employees 
in an effort to revive the catalog retailer's plunging profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves announced Tuesday came nearly three months after the  
company pushed out its chief executive and head of sales amid the 
slumping profits and increased competition in the mail-order 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Lands' End will close stores in Rockford and Vernon Hills, Ill.,  
and Iowa City, Iowa, in March. The closings will leave Lands' End 
with 16 outlet stores as it concentrates on selling its clothing, 
accessories and other wares through catalogs and the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Lands' End also will close its Willis &AMP; Geiger division, which  
produces an outdoor apparel catalog, after being unable to find a 
buyer. The division employs 12 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, 94 of the company's 888 salaried jobs are being cut at  
all levels. Hourly workers in the company's sales, distribution and 
service centers will not be affected, said David F. Dyer, president 
and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot continue to support this large a staff, nor can we  
operate as cohesively as we need to, without restructuring our 
company,'' Dyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the news, Lands' End shares were up 8 percent, rising $2 to  
close at $27.06 1/4 a share on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Dyer replaced CEO Michael Smith, who was pushed out in October  
along with vice chairman of sales William Ferry. A month later, the 
company reported its third-quarter profits plunged 96 percent to 
just $347,000, compared to $8.2 million during the same period in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Costs associated with the latest moves will reduce earnings by  
an undisclosed amount in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999, which 
ends Jan. 29.

<HEADLINE>  Jordan Expected To Retire Tomorrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- For six months, Michael Jordan teased, taunted  
and tantalized a nation awaiting his answer. 
</P>
<P>
	At last, he appears to have one.  
</P>
<P>
	The greatest player in NBA history and the most popular athlete  
since Muhammad Ali is expected to announce his retirement 
Wednesday, a source with close ties to the NBA told The Associated 
Press on Monday night. The Bulls scheduled a news conference for 
noon EST Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	If so, it would be the second time in five years that Jordan has  
walked away from the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew Michael wasn't coming back,'' Bulls free agent Dickey  
Simpkins said today at the team's training site in Deerfield. ``He 
dropped hints last season and last summer that this would probably 
be his last go-around. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ending on top was how he wants to do it and that's about the  
best way you can do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just as with Jordan's first retirement, a number of factors --  
his age, a picture-perfect ending to last season, a fractured 
beginning for this one -- appear to have influenced his decision. 
And just like last time, Jordan could change his mind and return at 
some point. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look forward to seeing him sometime in late March when he  
makes his return again in Market Square Arena,'' Pacers coach Larry 
Bird said. 
</P>
<P>
	But for now, he is expected to once again leave the game that  
bears his indelible mark, leave it when he's at the top, the way he 
said he would. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a man who truly, as far as I'm concerned, is the  
modern day Babe Ruth,'' former NBA great and current Lakers vice 
president Jerry West said recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan did not return a message left on his phone, and Bulls  
owner Jerry Reinsdorf, reached at his Arizona home, said: ``I don't 
have any reaction. I don't have any comments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buzz Peterson, the Appalachian State basketball coach who was  
Jordan's teammate and college roommate at North Carolina, said he 
believes Jordan made up his mind a long time ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I called him this morning and asked him, `What's going on?  
I've got 25 pink slip phone messages here in front of me,'' 
Peterson said. ``He just laughed and said everything's coming out 
now, and everything's being said. I can't confirm what he's going 
to say tomorrow but he feels like he's making the right decision 
for himself and his family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about Jordan's retirement, Bulls spokesman Tim Hallam  
said, ``At this particular time, I can't comment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's retirement also was reported by The New York Times, USA  
Today and The Denver Post. 
</P>
<P>
	His agent, David Falk, said that until Jordan ``announces  
whether he is retiring or returning, anything else is 
speculation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And there's been a considerable amount of that ever since Jordan  
hit the final, thrilling shot in Game 6 of the NBA Finals in Utah 
to lock up the Bulls' sixth championship of the decade. That 
speculation intensified last week, when the NBA players and owners 
reached a settlement to end the six-month lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan turns 36 next month. The five-time league MVP led the NBA  
in scoring 10 times and averaged 31.5 points per game, best in 
league history. 
</P>
<P>
	With NBA players preparing for an abbreviated season to begin  
Feb. 5, Jordan was expected to announce his plans before training 
camps opened Monday. He had been in the Bahamas on vacation, but 
returned to Chicago earlier this week. Another source, who also 
requested anonymity, told the AP that Jordan summoned teammates 
Scottie Pippen and Ron Harper to his home to discuss the team's 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan retired from the Bulls the first time in October 1993,  
saying he accomplished everything he wanted to in basketball and 
planned to devote more time to his family. Instead, he spent 1994 
playing minor league baseball for the Double-A Birmingham Barons, a 
farm team of the Chicago White Sox. The budding outfield prospect 
left baseball in the spring of 1995, rather than get caught up in 
another labor squabble between owners and players, and returned to 
the game he loved. 
</P>
<P>
	While his skills were still considerable, Jordan quickly learned  
he could no longer dominate the game the way he once did. The Bulls 
were knocked out of the postseason in the Eastern Conference 
semifinals by Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	But then, just as he had in every previous offseason, Jordan  
went back to work. He added a nearly unstoppable fadeaway jump shot 
to his arsenal, and after a rigorous weight-training and 
conditioning program, he came back the next season better than 
ever. The Bulls then set off on another three-peat that ended last 
June in Utah with Jordan stealing the ball and making the 
game-clinching shot in the final seconds -- one of the most 
memorable sequences of his memorable career. 
</P>
<P>
	It was precisely the lack of offseason work this past summer  
that made many of Jordan's teammates doubt he would return. 
</P>
<P>
	``He prepares as well as anybody but from all I hear, he's been  
playing golf and going to the Bahamas,'' teammate Steve Kerr said 
recently. ``Unless he's working out in a hidden gym somewhere down 
in the Bahamas, I don't think he's really preparing to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan had always vowed to leave the game on top, and in private  
moments, he would confide that watching Willie Mays stagger under 
fly balls long after his skills faded was a powerful lesson. 
</P>
<P>
	There were several other factors that may have weighed on his  
decision. Jordan feuded with general manager Jerry Krause for years 
and, at the end of the last season, when Phil Jackson said he 
wouldn't return, Jordan said he wouldn't play for another coach. 
</P>
<P>
	During the summer, the Bulls hired former Iowa State coach Tim  
Floyd and introduced him at a news conference as the team's vice 
president for basketball operations. But Floyd, a longtime favorite 
of Krause, was widely thought to be the coach-in-waiting, and his 
hiring may have further aggravated Jordan's relationship with the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	For whatever reason, his decision to retire leaves the NBA in  
the lurch. Coming off a divisive labor fight that left fans more 
apathetic than angry, Jordan was the one drawing card that could 
have helped the league regain its popularity. 
</P>
<P>
	He refused to be labeled the league's caretaker, but when he  
came back the first time, Jordan said it was partly because he 
wanted to teach some of the younger players how to comport 
themselves -- both on the court and off. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's finished, we're the ones who are at a loss, the fans  
who enjoyed him and the players who played with him and against 
him,'' Suns owner Jerry Colangelo said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do believe the game is very resilient. Having been in the  
league for 32 years, I've seen us at different cycles, up and down. 
I've seen a concern about who is going to replace stars at that 
time. Thank goodness there have been new players to take the places 
of the great stars of the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, Colangelo added, ``Recognize that he is by himself when you  
talk about great stars, but somewhere beyond the NBA today there 
will be some players to come who will be great players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether there will be another with Jordan's worldwide appeal,  
though, remains to be seen. After Magic Johnson and Bird helped 
lift pro basketball's profile in the early 1980s, Jordan took it to 
the next level almost single-handedly. 
</P>
<P>
	He also took the game itself above the rim, inspiring the  
generation of players who followed him to devise more and more 
spectacular moves. Every night of the NBA season yielded a bonanza 
of highlight-reel clips and when they were packaged on sports 
programs, the league's popularity soared along with the players. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan also pulled players salaries into the stratosphere as  
well. He made more than $30 million in each of the last two seasons 
and players like Shaquille O'Neal and Kevin Garnett rode his 
coattails to secure $100 million deals. 
</P>
<P>
	Last June, Fortune magazine totaled what it called ``The Jordan  
Effect,'' putting his impact on the economy, since joining the NBA 
in 1984, at $10 billion. It calculated he sold an extra $165 
million in tickets for the league, and delivered an extra $366 
million in revenue, mostly in added TV money and the sale of 
merchandise such as jerseys, hats and posters. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike, among the most prominent of the dozen or so companies who  
hired him as an endorser, has sold more than $2.6 billion in 
Jordan-related products. At the start of his career, the Bulls 
averaged only 6,365 fans per game. In his third season, the team 
began a string of sellouts that reached 542 consecutive games.

<HEADLINE>  Jordan Expected To Retire Tomorrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- For six months, Michael Jordan teased, taunted  
and tantalized a nation awaiting his answer. 
</P>
<P>
	At last, he appears to have one.  
</P>
<P>
	The greatest player in NBA history and the most popular athlete  
since Muhammad Ali is expected to announce his retirement 
Wednesday, a source with close ties to the NBA told The Associated 
Press on Monday night. The Bulls scheduled a news conference for 
noon EST Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	If so, it would be the second time in five years that Jordan has  
walked away from the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew Michael wasn't coming back,'' Bulls free agent Dickey  
Simpkins said today at the team's training site in Deerfield. ``He 
dropped hints last season and last summer that this would probably 
be his last go-around. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ending on top was how he wants to do it and that's about the  
best way you can do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just as with Jordan's first retirement, a number of factors --  
his age, a picture-perfect ending to last season, a fractured 
beginning for this one -- appear to have influenced his decision. 
And just like last time, Jordan could change his mind and return at 
some point. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look forward to seeing him sometime in late March when he  
makes his return again in Market Square Arena,'' Pacers coach Larry 
Bird said. 
</P>
<P>
	But for now, he is expected to once again leave the game that  
bears his indelible mark, leave it when he's at the top, the way he 
said he would. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a man who truly, as far as I'm concerned, is the  
modern day Babe Ruth,'' former NBA great and current Lakers vice 
president Jerry West said recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan did not return a message left on his phone, and Bulls  
owner Jerry Reinsdorf, reached at his Arizona home, said: ``I don't 
have any reaction. I don't have any comments.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Government Mulls Airport Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bill to renew the Federal Aviation  
Administration may include a proposal to raise an airport ticket 
tax from $3 to $5, The Associated Press has learned. 
</P>
<P>
	The passenger facility charge, or PFC, is a tax requested by  
local governments and earmarked for improvements at their airports. 
It must be approved by the Transportation Department. 
</P>
<P>
	PFCs are capped at $12 a ticket -- equal to four $3 charges per  
round trip -- but would rise to a maximum of $20 a ticket under the 
administration proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government also levies its own airline ticket tax: 8  
percent of a passenger's airfare, plus $2 for each leg of a trip. 
The combination of taxes and PFCs can add substantially to the 
price of an airplane ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the cost of a round trip from Washington to Orange  
County, Calif., via O'Hare airport in Chicago climbs by a total of 
$35 when the tax, segment charges and PFCs are added. The airports 
in Washington and Chicago both charge $3 facility fees each way. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year the Clinton administration tried to raise the fee from  
$3 to $4 per airport, but Congress rejected the change. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has yet to announce its latest intentions,  
but the fee increase is one of the final elements being drafted 
into legislation that would reauthorize the FAA, according to a 
Transportation Department source, who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview in December, Transportation Secretary Rodney  
Slater said the nation's aviation system needs widespread 
investment, including money to modernize the air traffic control 
system, improve personnel training and rebuild airports. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's administration proposal to raise the PFC was  
supported by the Airports Council International-North America, 
which represents airport operators. It said airports will not be 
able to handle an expected surge in travel without significant 
capital investment. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's airlines carried an estimated 615 million  
passengers in 1998. Within a decade, that figure is expected to 
exceed 1 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, airlines have opposed an increase in PFCs, because  
they add to the bottom line of a ticket but do not go to the 
airlines themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``More than enough money is collected through the various means  
such as the airport (trust) program, existing PFCs, the fees paid 
by airlines and concession revenues,'' said Edward Merlis, head of 
legislative affairs at the Air Transport Association, an airline 
trade group. 
</P>
<P>
	The political prospects for a PFC increase are uncertain.  
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Pa., chairman of the House  
Transportation Committee, said he will try to pass legislation 
requiring that all federal ticket tax money be spent on airport 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	The money is deposited in the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, but  
Shuster said that of the $10 billion expected to be collected this 
year, only $5.6 billion will be spent. The rest, as in past years, 
will be left on the federal government ledger sheet to contribute 
to a balanced budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster said that if he is successful in getting all tax money  
spent on airport improvements, he would also support an increase in 
the passenger facility charge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I used to be a purist; now I'll take the money any way I can  
get it,'' said the Pennsylvania Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's 1998 PFC proposal died in the Senate  
Commerce Committee, which is headed by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. 
Separately, he has been fighting for aviation legislation that 
would add flights out of congested airports and increase the 
permissible length of flights from Ronald Reagan Washington 
National Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Those proposals also died in Congress last year, and Shuster  
said he remains opposed to any changes in the National airport 
perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, nothing is in concrete; it's on the table,'' he told  
reporters.

<HEADLINE> Soybean, Grain Futures Fall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean and grain futures prices fell Tuesday on  
the Chicago Board of Trade after federal officials released 1998 
crop figures showing a larger-than-expected surplus and waning 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, lean hog futures rose the limit, 2 cents a  
pound, for the fifth time in the past six trading sessions, while 
coffee futures dropped fairly substantially. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts and traders had anticipated that the U.S.  
Department of Agriculture's release of 1998 crop reports would 
reveal sizable crops -- a sentiment that some say also caused 
soybean and grain futures to begin their downward slide Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the report showed a record soybean crop and the  
second-largest corn crop ever. The U.S. soybean crop was up 3 
percent compared with 1997, according to the report. The corn crop 
was up 6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody ran scared,'' Dick Smetana, research director at  
Chicago-based AgResource Co., said of the response to the report 
and its indications that demand could continue to wane. 
</P>
<P>
	Some were particularly troubled by an increase in the amount of  
soybean and grains that remained stored at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's plenty of supplies and we're not going to run out. I  
think that was the message from all these reports,'' said Jack 
Scoville, a trader with the Chicago-based Price Futures Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Scoville said he wouldn't be surprised if March corn futures  
drops to the $2.10-a-bushel range and March soybeans to the $5 
range -- especially if rain boosts crops in Brazil and Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to find a price level that we can keep moving product  
at,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 wheat crop was slightly smaller than expected -- a  
downward trend that government officials say they expect to 
continue -- though that news did little to soften the fall for wheat 
futures. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Tuesday, wheat for March delivery fell 4 1/4 cents to  
$2.81 1/2 a bushel; March corn dropped 2 1/2 cents to $2.17 1/4 a bushel; 
March oats fell 2 3/4 cents to $1.08 1/2 a bushel; and March soybeans 
fell 8 1/4 cents to $5.38 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, lean hog futures rallied to a 2-month high with  
February futures breaking through the 41-cent-a-pound mark. 
February pork belly futures also continued their upward trend, 
nearly hitting a five-month high Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say the market is being fueled by thoughts that the  
glut of live hogs waiting to go to slaughter may not be as big as 
originally thought. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Tuesday, February live cattle futures were unchanged  
at 62.32 cents a pound; March feeder cattle fell .03 cent to 72.92 
cents a pound; February lean hogs rose the limit 2 cents to 41.20 
cents a pound; February pork bellies were up the limit 3 cents to 
55.22 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, coffee futures fell on the Board of Trade of the City  
of New York on thoughts that predictions for a major cold snap in 
Mexico were overblown. Analysts say there's also nervousness about 
the beleaguered stock market in Brazil, one of the world's major 
coffee suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
	March arabica coffee fell 2.80 cents to $1.1715 a pound.

</P>
<P>
	If so, it would be the second time in five years that Jordan has  
walked away from the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew Michael wasn't coming back,'' Bulls free agent Dickey  
Simpkins said today at the team's training site in Deerfield. ``He 
dropped hints last season and last summer that this would probably 
be his last go-around. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ending on top was how he wants to do it and that's about the  
best way you can do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just as with Jordan's first retirement, a number of factors --  
his age, a picture-perfect ending to last season, a fractured 
beginning for this one -- appear to have influenced his decision. 
And just like last time, Jordan could change his mind and return at 
some point. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look forward to seeing him sometime in late March when he  
makes his return again in Market Square Arena,'' Pacers coach Larry 
Bird said. 
</P>
<P>
	But for now, he is expected to once again leave the game that  
bears his indelible mark, leave it when he's at the top, the way he 
said he would. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a man who truly, as far as I'm concerned, is the  
modern day Babe Ruth,'' former NBA great and current Lakers vice 
president Jerry West said recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan did not return a message left on his phone, and Bulls  
owner Jerry Reinsdorf, reached at his Arizona home, said: ``I don't 
have any reaction. I don't have any comments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buzz Peterson, the Appalachian State basketball coach who was  
Jordan's teammate and college roommate at North Carolina, said he 
believes Jordan made up his mind a long time ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I called him this morning and asked him, `What's going on?  
I've got 25 pink slip phone messages here in front of me,'' 
Peterson said. ``He just laughed and said everything's coming out 
now, and everything's being said. I can't confirm what he's going 
to say tomorrow but he feels like he's making the right decision 
for himself and his family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about Jordan's retirement, Bulls spokesman Tim Hallam  
said, ``At this particular time, I can't comment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's retirement also was reported by The New York Times, USA  
Today and The Denver Post. 
</P>
<P>
	His agent, David Falk, said that until Jordan ``announces  
whether he is retiring or returning, anything else is 
speculation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And there's been a considerable amount of that ever since Jordan  
hit the final, thrilling shot in Game 6 of the NBA Finals in Utah 
to lock up the Bulls' sixth championship of the decade. That 
speculation intensified last week, when the NBA players and owners 
reached a settlement to end the six-month lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan turns 36 next month. The five-time league MVP led the NBA  
in scoring 10 times and averaged 31.5 points per game, best in 
league history. 
</P>
<P>
	With NBA players preparing for an abbreviated season to begin  
Feb. 5, Jordan was expected to announce his plans before training 
camps opened Monday. He had been in the Bahamas on vacation, but 
returned to Chicago earlier this week. Another source, who also 
requested anonymity, told the AP that Jordan summoned teammates 
Scottie Pippen and Ron Harper to his home to discuss the team's 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan retired from the Bulls the first time in October 1993,  
saying he accomplished everything he wanted to in basketball and 
planned to devote more time to his family. Instead, he spent 1994 
playing minor league baseball for the Double-A Birmingham Barons, a 
farm team of the Chicago White Sox. The budding outfield prospect 
left baseball in the spring of 1995, rather than get caught up in 
another labor squabble between owners and players, and returned to 
the game he loved. 
</P>
<P>
	While his skills were still considerable, Jordan quickly learned  
he could no longer dominate the game the way he once did. The Bulls 
were knocked out of the postseason in the Eastern Conference 
semifinals by Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	But then, just as he had in every previous offseason, Jordan  
went back to work. He added a nearly unstoppable fadeaway jump shot 
to his arsenal, and after a rigorous weight-training and 
conditioning program, he came back the next season better than 
ever. The Bulls then set off on another three-peat that ended last 
June in Utah with Jordan stealing the ball and making the 
game-clinching shot in the final seconds -- one of the most 
memorable sequences of his memorable career. 
</P>
<P>
	It was precisely the lack of offseason work this past summer  
that made many of Jordan's teammates doubt he would return. 
</P>
<P>
	``He prepares as well as anybody but from all I hear, he's been  
playing golf and going to the Bahamas,'' teammate Steve Kerr said 
recently. ``Unless he's working out in a hidden gym somewhere down 
in the Bahamas, I don't think he's really preparing to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan had always vowed to leave the game on top, and in private  
moments, he would confide that watching Willie Mays stagger under 
fly balls long after his skills faded was a powerful lesson. 
</P>
<P>
	There were several other factors that may have weighed on his  
decision. Jordan feuded with general manager Jerry Krause for years 
and, at the end of the last season, when Phil Jackson said he 
wouldn't return, Jordan said he wouldn't play for another coach. 
</P>
<P>
	During the summer, the Bulls hired former Iowa State coach Tim  
Floyd and introduced him at a news conference as the team's vice 
president for basketball operations. But Floyd, a longtime favorite 
of Krause, was widely thought to be the coach-in-waiting, and his 
hiring may have further aggravated Jordan's relationship with the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	For whatever reason, his decision to retire leaves the NBA in  
the lurch. Coming off a divisive labor fight that left fans more 
apathetic than angry, Jordan was the one drawing card that could 
have helped the league regain its popularity. 
</P>
<P>
	He refused to be labeled the league's caretaker, but when he  
came back the first time, Jordan said it was partly because he 
wanted to teach some of the younger players how to comport 
themselves -- both on the court and off. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's finished, we're the ones who are at a loss, the fans  
who enjoyed him and the players who played with him and against 
him,'' Suns owner Jerry Colangelo said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do believe the game is very resilient. Having been in the  
league for 32 years, I've seen us at different cycles, up and down. 
I've seen a concern about who is going to replace stars at that 
time. Thank goodness there have been new players to take the places 
of the great stars of the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, Colangelo added, ``Recognize that he is by himself when you  
talk about great stars, but somewhere beyond the NBA today there 
will be some players to come who will be great players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether there will be another with Jordan's worldwide appeal,  
though, remains to be seen. After Magic Johnson and Bird helped 
lift pro basketball's profile in the early 1980s, Jordan took it to 
the next level almost single-handedly. 
</P>
<P>
	He also took the game itself above the rim, inspiring the  
generation of players who followed him to devise more and more 
spectacular moves. Every night of the NBA season yielded a bonanza 
of highlight-reel clips and when they were packaged on sports 
programs, the league's popularity soared along with the players. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan also pulled players salaries into the stratosphere as  
well. He made more than $30 million in each of the last two seasons 
and players like Shaquille O'Neal and Kevin Garnett rode his 
coattails to secure $100 million deals. 
</P>
<P>
	Last June, Fortune magazine totaled what it called ``The Jordan  
Effect,'' putting his impact on the economy, since joining the NBA 
in 1984, at $10 billion. It calculated he sold an extra $165 
million in tickets for the league, and delivered an extra $366 
million in revenue, mostly in added TV money and the sale of 
merchandise such as jerseys, hats and posters. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike, among the most prominent of the dozen or so companies who  
hired him as an endorser, has sold more than $2.6 billion in 
Jordan-related products. At the start of his career, the Bulls 
averaged only 6,365 fans per game. In his third season, the team 
began a string of sellouts that reached 542 consecutive games.

<HEADLINE>  Jordan Expected To Retire Tomorrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- For six months, Michael Jordan teased, taunted  
and tantalized a nation awaiting his answer. 
</P>
<P>
	At last, he appears to have one.  
</P>
<P>
	The greatest player in NBA history and the most popular athlete

<HEADLINE> Freeze Drops Orange Crop by 8 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Freezing temperatures in California last month  
have pushed down orange production nationwide by 8 percent, the 
Agriculture Department said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-day stretch of snow and freezing temperatures in the  
San Joaquin Valley in late December wrecked havoc on the area, 
wiping out the lemon crop and crippling the rest of the citrus 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Citrus losses were estimated at $634 million and rising by the  
state's Department of Food and Agriculture on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	California's orange production is now forecast at 1.43 million  
tons for the season. That's down 39 percent from October and 49 
percent from the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Agriculture Department, growers in California  
are still estimating how much fruit is salvageable from areas where 
temperatures dipped into the low 20s. Many growers are optimistic 
that some of the fruit can be used for juice. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, orange production is forecast at 10.1 million tons,  
a decrease of 27 percent from last year's record crop of 13.9 
million tons. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida's orange crop, while 22 percent lower than last year,  
remains forecast at 8.55 million tons. 
</P>
<P>
	The orange shortage has led to higher prices for customers at  
many of the nation's grocery stores and produce markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida's crop is largely used for juice, while most of  
California's crop is to be eaten.

<HEADLINE> Infamous Drug Is Making a Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Diagnosed with brain cancer, Elizabeth  
Narcessian did not hesitate when her doctor prescribed thalidomide, 
the drug banned a generation ago after it led to thousands of 
deformed babies. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have a life-threatening illness and you are with a  
doctor you trust, you do anything,'' said Narcessian, a 40-year-old 
physician from Ridgewood, N.J., who credits the drug with helping 
to shrink her tumor. 
</P>
<P>
	Thalidomide, approved by regulators in July to treat a  
complication from leprosy, is making a comeback extending well 
beyond that rare disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Narcessian's doctor is one of a growing number prescribing it  
for some of the deadliest cancers even though tests have yet to 
definitively prove it works. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street seems to have already decided. Shares in Celgene  
Corp., the only U.S. seller of thalidomide, have more than doubled 
in the past month -- to about $16 -- after the company bought 
marketing rights to the drug from its closest rival. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts predict that thalidomide will post $45 million in sales  
this year, $70 million in 2000 and possibly $300 million within 
five years. While those are figures are small compared to the $3 
billion in sales generated by the world's top-selling drugs, the 
money would still represent a huge payday for Celgene. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thalidomide has a lot more potential that most people  
originally thought,'' said Maureen McEnroe, an analyst with HCFP 
Brenner Securities in New York. ``People who did not believe in it 
are now jumping on the bandwagon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone is convinced.  
</P>
<P>
	``Thalidomide does not yet appear to be a shining star,'' said  
Dr. Ajrmon Eyre, executive vice president for research at the 
American Cancer Society. 
</P>
<P>
	Eyre said the drug hasn't always worked and he prefers to see  
final test results before reaching a conclusion on its 
effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	Even doctors who prescribe it do so only after other less  
dangerous drugs fail. 
</P>
<P>
	Thalidomide, originally intended for morning sickness and as a  
sedative for pregnant women, was banned worldwide in the 1960s 
after causing 12,000 babies to be born with no limbs or flipperlike 
arms and legs, serious facial deformities and defective organs. 
</P>
<P>
	The pill had been sold in 48 countries, though not in the United  
States because a scientist with the Food and Drug Administration 
blocked the approval. She was not satisfied with the safety 
assurances from the manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1990s, scientists discovered thalidomide could be a  
potent treatment. In addition to cancer, testing is now under way 
in patients with AIDS, lupus and other diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	Thalidomide, which Celgene sells under the brand name Thalomid,  
works by cutting off the blood supply to tumors. When combined with 
chemotherapy or radiation therapy, the cancer cells, in theory, die 
of starvation. 
</P>
<P>
	Narcessian, a doctor who specializes in rehabilitation medicine,  
said taking the drug makes her feel as if she is actively fighting 
the cancer even after completing six weeks of radiation therapy. 
She said she has experienced no side effects.

<HEADLINE> PAL, Creditors To Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Financially troubled Philippine  
Airlines will try to convince major foreign creditors to approve a 
plan to rehabilitate the company, an official said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost all of PAL's creditors have rejected the plan, which  
calls for a restructuring of debts, the scaling down of its fleet 
and an infusion of at least $150 million in fresh capital. 
</P>
<P>
	PAL says it is saddled with debts of $2.1 billion, which it has  
not been able to repay since last July. The airline secured a 
moratorium on debt payments from the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Manila's corporate watchdog, amid its financial and 
labor problems. 
</P>
<P>
	SEC chairman Perfecto Yasay said PAL and its creditors will  
discuss the rehabilitation plan Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Former executives of Cathay Pacific Airways hired recently by  
PAL to manage the airline will meet the creditors in an effort to 
convince them to support the plan, said Jaime Bautista, PAL's vice 
president for finance. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Foster, Cathay's former regional manager for Taiwan and  
the Philippines, and Mike Scantlebury, a former finance director at 
Cathay's major shareholder, will start working for PAL on 
Wednesday, Bautista said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay was a prospective investor in PAL, but talks between the  
two airlines collapsed last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Asian currency crisis and a 22-day pilots' strike in June  
severely hobbled PAL, hurting its ability to pay maturing debts. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline closed for nearly two weeks in September until its  
largest union agreed to give up collective bargaining for 10 years 
in exchange for 20 percent of the company's stock.

<HEADLINE> Beer War Rages in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Go to a Chinese restaurant virtually anywhere  
in the world and you can wash down your roasted duck with a cold 
Tsingtao beer. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Hong Kong, a mecca of fine Chinese cuisine, sales of  
China's most famous beer -- perhaps its best-known brand name of any 
kind -- have been falling. 
</P>
<P>
	Tsingtao Brewery Co. Ltd. blames its old Hong Kong distributor  
and a lack of good marketing, a source says, and is now furiously 
fighting back with lawsuits seeking full control of the Tsingtao 
trademark in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	In an attempt to reverse the slide, Tsingtao Brewery dumped the  
distributor, China Beer (Hong Kong) Co. Ltd., at the end of last 
year and signed on with Tsingtao Beverage (Hong Kong) Co. Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	Tsingtao Brewery hopes a strong advertising campaign can  
persuade more drinkers in the territory to reach for Tsingtao 
instead of heavily advertised rivals such as Heineken and 
Carlsberg. Tsingtao executives fear that with no persuasive ad 
strategy, their brand has quietly developed a local image as a 
stodgy beer for older people, according to a source familiar with 
the situation who spoke to The Associated Press only on condition 
of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the drinkers may be thinking, Tsingtao sales in Hong  
Kong have fallen by a third over the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
	A top export official with Tsingtao Brewery, Wang Zhiguo, vowed  
in a statement that the brewery will ``re-launch its product in 
Hong Kong in a creative manner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Standing in the brewery's way is China Beer, which says it owns  
the Hong Kong trademark rights for Tsingtao beer. 
</P>
<P>
	Tsingtao's former distributor has launched a series of big  
newspaper advertisements, threatening to sue anybody who sells 
Tsingtao here without its permission. 
</P>
<P>
	Tsingtao Brewery worries the ads could spook drinkers into  
thinking the local supply of Tsingtao will dry up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Already you see Chinese reporters are writing speculative  
stories suggesting there will be no supply of Tsingtao beer,'' said 
spokesman Andrew Fung. 
</P>
<P>
	Has that hurt business?  
</P>
<P>
	``Not yet, but it will,'' Fung fretted.  
</P>
<P>
	After years of trying to regain the Hong Kong trademark through  
peaceful negotiations -- but apparently without offering any money, 
Fung says -- Tsingtao Brewery went to court in late December and 
again in early January, hoping to get the Hong Kong trademark and 
an injunction to stop China Beer's ads. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides were scheduled to appear in court on Feb. 2 to  
present arguments on the case, Fung said. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has been available for comment at China Beer, according  
to employees who have answered the phone when a reporter rang 
several times over the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hong Kong beer war is the latest and perhaps final battle to  
be fought over Tsingtao in a saga that involves the communist 
Chinese ``planned economy'' of the 1950s and China's efforts to 
become more market-oriented in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tsingtao Brewery was founded in 1903 by Germans who brought  
their fabled beermaking skills to the city of Tsingtao, Germany's 
old colonial capital in the province of Shandong. 
</P>
<P>
	Decades later, China's communist economic micro-managers decided  
that foreign sales of Tsingtao would be handled by professional 
exporters and not by the brewery. The Hong Kong trademark for 
Tsingtao was granted in 1958 and has changed hands several times 
since. 
</P>
<P>
	China moved in 1988 to get all overseas sales licenses for  
Tsingtao back for the brewery and by now has succeeded every place 
but Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	Tsingtao Brewery officials have watched with concern as sales  
plunged in Hong Kong, from 9,000 tons of beer a year in 1993, when 
the company was publicly listed in Hong Kong and Shanghai, to just 
6,000 tons annually, Fung said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fung could not say how many bottles of beer this is -- it depends  
on the size of each bottle -- and the company would not specify its 
Hong Kong revenues for competitive reasons.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Rebounds Against Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The dollar soared against the Japanese yen in  
European trading today after the Bank of Japan reportedly 
intervened in foreign exchange markets to support the U.S. currency 
for the first time since February 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar fell against the euro, the new single currency of 11  
nations, and declined against the Swiss franc. It rose against the 
British pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold was mixed in Europe after rising in Hong Kong.  
</P>
<P>
	The dollar began its rebound from 28-month lows against the yen  
in Japan early today as traders reported Japan's central bank was 
selling the yen and buying dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan's action came after Finance Minister Kiichi  
Miyazawa expressed concern about the dollar's plunge to a 28-month 
low of 108.21 yen at one point Monday. The dollar was as high as 
147.61 yen last August. 
</P>
<P>
	In late European trading, the dollar rose to 111.87 yen from  
Monday's 109.40. Earlier, the dollar finished Tokyo trading at 
112.50 yen. At midday in New York, the dollar was quoted at 112.10 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The move to intervene was triggered by growing anxiety over the  
yen's recent rally. A stronger yen makes Japanese exports more 
expensive abroad and cuts into profits earned overseas. Lower 
earnings at exporters could hamper efforts to stimulate Japan's 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin insisted  
today that there has been no change in the administration's policy 
of supporting a strong dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin would not comment directly on reports that Japan was  
intervening to support the dollar, but he did say: ``I'll just 
repeat what I've said so often, which is a strong dollar has served 
us well and our dollar policy is absolutely unchanged.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other European trading today, the euro rose to $1.1536 from  
$1.1521 on Monday, while the British pound fell to $1.6292 from 
$1.6396. The dollar also bought 1.3914 Swiss francs, down from 
1.3998 Monday, and 1.5062 Canadian dollars, up from 1.5060. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the euro was trading at $1.1538 at midday, while  
the pound was at $1.6301. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately, though they remain in use. Based on euro 
rates in Europe, the dollar was worth: 1.6954 German marks, down 
from 1.6976; 5.6862 French francs, down from 5.6936; 1.9103 Dutch 
guilders, down from 1.9128; and 1,678.46 Italian lire, down from 
1,680.64. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold closed in London at $291.55 bid per troy ounce, down from  
$292.30 on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Zurich the bid price was $289.70, down from $291.90.  
</P>
<P>
	Gold earlier rose $1.20 in Hong Kong to close at $291.95.  
</P>
<P>
	Silver closed in London at $5.32 bid per troy ounce, up from  
$5.29.

<HEADLINE> Customers Stock Up On 1-Cent Stamps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Customers across the country are jamming post  
offices clamoring for them, sometimes demanding thousands at a 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	And they are only worth a penny.  
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the postal rate of a basic first-class letter  
increased from 32 cents to 33 cents, making 1-cent stamps a hot 
ticket at local post offices. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lines are out the door,'' said Danny Cashen, station  
manager at the Oak Lawn Post Office in Dallas on Tuesday. ``It's 
very, very strange.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cashen said his office sold 40,000 of the 1-cent stamps on  
Saturday. On Monday, he picked up another 40,000 from his local 
distribution center. By Monday afternoon, it needed to replenish 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't realize how quickly they would go out,'' Cashen  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cashen is surprised at how long people are willing to wait just  
to pick up some 1-cent stamps. One customer even came in and bought 
10,000 of the penny stamps, probably anticipating a shortage, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	And many buying on behalf of their businesses have picked up  
sheets and sheets of the stamps. Demand is so high that the U.S. 
Postal Service has witnessed spot shortages in some places. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want people to buy as many 1-cent stamps as they need,''  
said Roy Betts, Postal Service spokesman. But ``there's no need to 
stockpile 1-cent stamps. They'll always be there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Postal Service is resupplying 1-cent stamps to those offices  
that are running low, Betts said. With 2.5 billion 1-cent stamps 
printed just for the rate increase, there are plenty to go around, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a question of supply,'' Betts said. ``There's ample  
supply.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rate increase, the first in four years, may have caught some  
people off guard, even though the first 33-cent stamps went on sale 
last week. It's the Chinese New Year stamp commemorating the year 
of the hare. In addition, millions of undenominated ``H'' rate 
stamps are available at post offices to cover the 33-cent rate. 
</P>
<P>
	But at the Grand Shelby Post Office in Detroit, the buzz among  
customers was all about the 1-cent stamp. 
</P>
<P>
	``They need to hoard them,'' said George Kujan, manager for  
customer service. ``It's a very good possibility they think (the 
stamps) won't be there next week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in fact, the 1-cent stamps will be around next week and  
thereafter. They are a permanent fixture at the post office. 
</P>
<P>
	Kujan predicts that after customers have overstocked with their  
penny purchases, they will realize they don't have quite that many 
32-cent stamps. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, they'll use them all,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> `Providence' Spurs NBC to Victory / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC got a divine gift last week as  
``Providence'' premiered with robust ratings and the network ended 
a four-week streak by CBS as the Nielsen ratings champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox could also smile, as its much-awaited animated comedy, ``The  
PJs,'' drew a healthy audience for its preview airing Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	After a dismal crop of new fall shows, NBC may have a  
much-needed hit with ``Providence,'' its replacement for Friday's 
instant flare-out ``Trinity.'' On the opener, the melodrama set in 
Rhode Island finished in eighth place with a 13.1 rating. It was 
the best premiere showing by an NBC drama since ``ER'' in September 
1994, the network said. 
</P>
<P>
	Created by Eddie Murphy, ``The PJs'' took 13th place with a 12.6  
rating, making it Sunday's most-watched show on any network. This 
week, it settled into its regular Tuesday slot. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, two returning series, CBS's ``The Magnificent Seven''  
and NBC's ``Lateline,'' didn't fare so well, finishing 57th and 
71st, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	In prime time for the week of Jan. 4 through 10, NBC logged a  
9.8 rating and 15 share, according to Nielsen Media Research 
figures released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS edged out ABC for second place, with a 9.5 rating and 15  
share. ABC had a 9.4 rating and 15 share. Fox (programming 15 
hours) had a 7.7 rating and 12 share. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the emerging networks, the WB had a 2.8 rating and 4  
share, UPN a 1.9 rating and 3 share and the Pax network a 0.7 
rating and 1 share. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. Share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the 16-week-old 1998-99 season, CBS is in first place with a  
9.1 rating. NBC is second with an 8.7 rating, followed by ABC at 
8.5 and Fox at 7.1. 
</P>
<P>
	In the evening news derby, ``NBC Nightly News'' retained the top  
spot last week with a 9.5 rating and 17 share. ABC's ``World News 
Tonight'' was second with a 9.1 rating and 17 share. ``The CBS 
Evening News'' was third with an 8.9 rating and 16 share. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of Jan. 4-10, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were: ``ER,'' NBC, 21.7; ``Friends,'' NBC, 17.6; ``Fiesta 
Bowl: Florida State vs. Tennessee,'' ABC, 17.2; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 
16.9; ``Just Shoot Me,'' NBC, 15.7; ``Veronica's Closet,'' NBC, 
14.7; ``Fox NFC Playoff: Arizona at Minnesota (First Portion of 
Post-Game Show),'' Fox, 14.5; ``Providence,'' NBC, 13.1; ``People's 
Choice Awards,'' CBS, and ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, tied at 12.9.

	Stage Set for Impeachment Drama  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's spokesman today dismissed  
the House Republicans' brief for the impeachment trial as an 
overblown account that ``reads like a cheap mystery.'' ``The 
discussions about sinister plots is something you would expect to 
read in a novel rather than in a document by the House of 
Representatives,'' spokesman Joe Lockhart said in response to the 
document filed yesterday. The White House will offer a more 
detailed brief of its own tomorrow. Both sides worked on honing the 
opening presentations they will give to the Senate later this week. 
Each side has 24 hours to make its presentation, with the White 
House to follow when the prosecutors are done.

filing a statement of candidacy with the Federal Election 
Commission. The Bill Bradley Presidential Exploratory Committee

Security and Cooperation in Europe said today. An OSCE statement

government education official said it will now be easier to carry 
out police and background checks on people who work with young 
children. Parliament also will be asked to boost the government's 
regulatory and enforcement powers over child care. The initiatives 
come after British au pair Louise Woodward was convicted in 
Massachusetts of killing 8-month-old Matthew Eappen in 1997.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supreme Court justices today questioned how to  
draw the line between schoolyard teasing among students and sexual 
harassment in debating whether schools can be held responsible for 
such conduct. ``I'm sure schoolchildren nationwide tease each 
other. Little boys tease little girls,'' Justice Sandra Day 
O'Connor said during arguments on a Georgia case involving crude 
and allegedly threatening conduct by a fifth-grade boy. The court 
is expected to decide by July whether educators violate a federal 
law when they fail to stop students from sexually harassing other 
students.

vehicle that jumped a ramp while being chased at Cedar Hill State 
Park southeast of Dallas. Although police said the sport utility

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. John Kasich, the boyish-looking House  
Budget Committee chairman from Ohio, will take the first step this 
week toward seeking the Republican presidential nomination, The

member, will form an exploratory committee with the Federal 
Election Commission tomorrow, allowing him to raise and spend money 
while he tests the waters, an official involved with the effort 
said today. He will announce this step Feb. 15 in Ohio, the

	Cigarettes Push Producer Prices Up  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A stunning 30.7 percent jump in prices charged  
by cigarette companies pushed up producer prices overall by a brisk 
0.4 percent in December. It was the biggest monthly increase in 14 
months, but wasn't enough to prevent the Labor Department's 
Producer Price Index from declining in 1998 for the second year in 
a row. Prices fell 0.1 percent last year after plunging 1.2 percent 
in 1997, the sharpest drop in 11 years. That marked the first 
back-to-back annual decline in the index since the government began 
compiling it in 1947.

<HEADLINE> 49ers Sign Mariucci to New Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- At last, the San Francisco 49ers and  
Steve Mariucci have something to show for 2 1/2 months of 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of those paragraphs were rewritten 15 different times, it  
seems, but finally it's all written the way it's supposed to be 
written,'' Mariucci said Tuesday after signing a five-year contract 
worth about $2 million per season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't tell you how excited I am to get this over with and  
move on, and find a way to keep our team together and add to it if 
we can and keep the guys that are necessary to continue to be a 
strong contender each year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, which replaced the three years remaining on his  
original pact, binds Mariucci to the 49ers through 2003 and ends 
speculation about his future with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a happy day,'' said interim general manager John  
McVay, who completed the contract negotiations this week after they 
were started in October by Larry Thrailkill, who resigned Saturday 
as interim team president. 
</P>
<P>
	``The team, and the ownership and the organization are delighted  
to have this done and to have the comfort of knowing that we're 
going to have Steve here for five years on a new contract,'' McVay 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Mariucci said he planned to meet later today with  
Bill Walsh to discuss Walsh's return to the organization. Walsh 
could be hired by Thursday or Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh, the Hall of Fame coach who led San Francisco to its first  
three Super Bowls, is expected to help in personnel evaluation and 
oversee the draft. The 49ers fired their director of player 
personnel, Vinny Cerrato, late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci, whose job security was the subject of constant  
speculation despite his winning record, said he was relieved the 
deal was finally done. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tried to bring this news to you earlier. Sorry it took so  
long,'' Mariucci said, smiling. ``We finally had the opportunity to 
spend the time to hammer out all the issues and discuss it with the 
necessary parties and come to an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci, who succeeded George Seifert two years ago, led San  
Francisco to a 12-4 regular season finish and an NFC wild-card 
victory over Green Bay before the 49ers were eliminated by Atlanta 
20-18 in a divisional playoff Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, he is 27-9, including an 18-1 mark at home, but there  
were rumors during the season that 49ers ownership planned to oust 
him and bring back Mike Holmgren from Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Those rumors stopped after the 49ers beat the Packers and  
Holmgren left Green Bay to become coach and general manager of the 
Seattle Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
	But as recently as Monday, ESPN reported that Mariucci was  
angered over a last-minute snag in the contract negotiations and 
supposedly was about to ask out of his contract or resign. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci denied that he considered leaving the 49ers at any  
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing to me how many rumors there were, and I couldn't  
imagine where they were getting these ideas,'' he said. ``I heard I 
was mad and irate, and all those things. Sure, maybe we were all a 
little frustrated that it took so long to get it done. But those 
things happen in a negotiation. I'm satisfied and happy with it. 
The club is happy and satisfied with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci said the talks took longer than expected because he was  
busy running the team during the season and the 49ers' front office 
has been in flux with co-owner Eddie DeBartolo still awaiting NFL 
clearance to resume control of the team from his sister, co-owner 
Denise DeBartolo York. 
</P>
<P>
	The team also has yet to sign permanent replacements for Carmen  
Policy and Dwight Clark, who were the 49ers' top two executives 
before moving on to the Cleveland Browns expansion franchise.

<HEADLINE> Suspect Held in Horse Shootings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Police said Tuesday they have three suspects  
in the slaughter of 34 wild horses shot to death with high-powered 
rifles, including two Marines. 
</P>
<P>
	``One is in custody and two more arrests are pending,'' said  
Washoe County Sheriff's Lt. Janice Lee. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspects were not identified. Major Lenny Ryan at Camp  
Pendleton, Calif., confirmed that two of the suspects are Marines -- 
one stationed at Twentynine Palms west of Los Angeles and the other 
at Camp Pendleton north of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Law officers have been investigating the case since the 34  
free-roaming mustangs were shot to death Dec. 27 about 5 miles east 
of the Reno-Sparks area. 
</P>
<P>
	The shootings rocked the local community. Animal protection  
groups helped raise a $35,000 reward for information leading to the 
arrest and conviction of those responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the horses were maimed and at least one was blasted with  
a chemical fire extinguisher on the rugged hillside about one mile 
south of Interstate 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said they would seek felony charges in the case,  
punishable by between two and five years in jail for each horse 
killed.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Steps Up Banana Trade War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Increasing the threat of a multimillion-dollar  
trade war over bananas, the United States said Tuesday it would 
notify the World Trade Organization on Jan. 25 of its intention to 
slap sanctions on the European Union. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. trade ambassador Rita Hayes said Washington would impose  
100 percent tariffs against a wide range of European products 
regardless of renewed WTO moves to assess whether EU banana import 
laws break international trade rules. 
</P>
<P>
	EU ambassador Roderick Abbott rejected U.S. offers of further  
negotiations to settle the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are two little problems,'' Abbott said in a message to  
the United States and its allies in Central America. ``One is that 
you are threatening us with $500 million worth of retaliation and 
people don't negotiate very well under the threat of a big stick. 
The other one is that you are the only people who say we have to 
change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The banana dispute has rumbled on for years. It began when the  
EU decided to provide better access to bananas from former European 
colonies at the expense of U.S.-owned Latin American producers who 
serve 85 percent of the world market. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1997 WTO panel ruling said this violated fair trade rules.  
</P>
<P>
	The European Union says it has changed its laws to conform with  
the WTO judgment. But the United States and Central American banana 
producers say it hasn't done enough. 
</P>
<P>
	The WTO meeting Tuesday agreed to requests from the EU and  
Ecuador to reconvene the 1997 panel to examine whether the EU had 
complied. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuador, one of the biggest banana producers, hopes the panel  
will find the EU in the wrong. The EU hopes it will be vindicated. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's decision complicates an already difficult legal  
situation. The WTO, set up in 1995, has never been asked to approve 
sanctions and trade experts are uncertain how to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU has warned that U.S. sanctions action may risk setting  
off a tit-for-tat war. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration last month announced a list of  
European export items that would be subject to 100 percent tariffs, 
ranging from greeting cards to cashmere sweaters. The sanctions 
would be likely to come into force in March and hit Britain and 
Italy hardest.

<HEADLINE> New Implant To Correct Eyesight OKd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- Some 20 million nearsighted Americans may  
soon be able to get tiny, transparent rings implanted onto their 
corneas to help them see better, maybe perfectly, without glasses 
or contact lenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The government is considering whether to let KeraVision Inc.'s  
Intacs sell as an alternative to highly popular eye surgery. The 
key difference: While eye surgery is permanent, the implants' 
effects seem reversible in most cases because they don't destroy 
the eye tissue. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no eraser at the end of a laser,'' noted Dr. Marian  
Macsai, an ophthalmologist at West Virginia University. ``This is 
removable -- take it out'' if there's a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Macsai and fellow advisers to the Food and Drug Administration  
voted unanimously Tuesday that Intacs -- transparent crescents about 
as thick as contact lenses that form a ring around the edge of the 
cornea -- should be sold. 
</P>
<P>
	But they stressed that patients must be warned that removing the  
implants usually, but not always, helps if patients suffer side 
effects or are dissatisfied with their resulting vision. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's largely reversible,'' said panel chairman Dr. James  
McCulley of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. 
But ``it's not an absolute certainty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA is not bound by its advisers' recommendations but  
typically follows them. 
</P>
<P>
	If approved, Intacs would cost about the same as laser surgery  
for nearsightedness, $2,200 per eye. Made of the same material as 
lenses implanted during cataract surgery, Intacs would come in 
three thicknesses, for different degrees of mild to moderate 
nearsightedness. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearsightedness -- poor distance vision -- occurs when a person's  
cornea is too steeply curved. Flattening the cornea, the membrane 
that covers the front of the eye, helps correct nearsightedness. 
Hundreds of thousands of Americans have sought radial keratotomy, 
where surgeons slice the cornea with a knife, or laser surgery, 
which shaves the cornea to flatten it. 
</P>
<P>
	But those surgeries can be risky, sometimes causing problems  
with night vision, glare, seeing halos or blurry vision. Patients 
occasionally cannot see as well after surgery as before. Thus, most 
patients who choose these operations do so because they are 
severely nearsighted. 
</P>
<P>
	With Intacs, the implants' slight weight flattens the cornea.  
</P>
<P>
	KeraVision will target some 20 million mildly to moderately  
nearsighted Americans -- whose vision ranges from 20/40, where it's 
OK to drive but a movie is blurry without glasses, to 20/200, where 
patients can barely see the big ``E'' at the top of eye charts. 
</P>
<P>
	In a yearlong study of 449 eyes, 97 percent had 20/40 vision or  
better without glasses or contact lenses after the implant. About 
74 percent had 20/20 or better vision without glasses, and 53 
percent could see 20/16 -- the sharper vision that chief 
investigator Dr. David Schanzlin of the University of California, 
San Diego, said is required of combat pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	Most patients achieved good vision a day after surgery.  
</P>
<P>
	Intacs aren't risk-free: Some 7 percent to 17 percent of  
patients suffered side effects similar to laser surgery, including 
glare, halos and problems with night vision. 
</P>
<P>
	About 5 percent of patients had their implants removed. That  
included 14 patients dissatisfied with their vision correction and 
16 who had visual side effects; some were in both categories. 
Removing the implant corrected more than 80 percent of those side 
effects, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	But if patients don't see well enough, can they trade one set of  
Intacs for a thicker, better size? The FDA panel said KeraVision 
hasn't yet proved that. The company is studying thicker sizes for 
more severely nearsighted patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The operation itself is ``very easy to master,'' said Schanzlin.  
</P>
<P>
	Patients get anesthetic eye drops to numb the eye, but remain  
awake. The doctor clamps the eyelid open, cuts a tiny pocket into 
the cornea and uses a special device to slip the crescents onto the 
cornea. The implants are made of the same material as the lenses 
implanted into cataract surgery patients. A single stitch closes 
the wound. 
</P>
<P>
	It takes about 15 minutes. About 15 percent of patients report  
some pain. As with any surgery, infection also is a risk.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Lawyer Cool Under Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some people were taken aback when President  
Clinton's own lawyer conceded that reasonable people might think he 
testified falsely under oath. But those who know Charles F.C. Ruff 
were not surprised. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll give ground where he doesn't think the ground is  
defensible,'' says Philip Heymann, a Harvard law professor and 
former deputy attorney general in the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	When Ruff leads Clinton's impeachment trial defense team  
starting Thursday, ``there will be nothing 'scorched-earth' about 
it,'' Heymann added. ``It will be very appealing to the American 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff, 59, the White House counsel, made his eyebrow-raising  
concession about Clinton when he appeared last month before the 
House Judiciary Committee as the president's lawyers sought to 
persuade the House not to impeach Clinton on charges of perjury and 
obstruction of justice in the Monica Lewinsky affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether Clinton had lied under oath, Ruff said,  
``Reasonable people ... could determine that he crossed over that 
line and that, what for him was truthful and misleading or 
nonresponsive and misleading or evasive, was, in fact, false,'' 
Ruff told the committee. But he insisted Clinton's sworn testimony 
was not perjury, which requires an intent to lie. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington lawyer E. Lawrence Barcella, who served as a federal  
prosecutor when Ruff was U.S. attorney in the District of Columbia, 
said Ruff's arguments were ``classic Chuck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You understood that he wasn't excusing Bill Clinton's  
behavior. He was trying to explain the legal defense available 
without saying his client's behavior was acceptable,'' Barcella 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But former U.S. attorney Joseph Di Genova says the Clinton case  
``has drawn (Ruff) out in the forefront of being an onboard 
Democratic lawyer.'' Di Genova said it ``demonstrates a certain 
partisan affiliation which many, many people from the Watergate era 
have tried not to demonstrate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff's legal career has included stints as Watergate prosecutor,  
acting deputy attorney general in the Carter administration and 
District of Columbia corporation counsel. He represented Sen. John 
Glenn, D-Ohio, in the Keating Five scandal, which resulted in a 
Senate Ethics Committee finding that Glenn broke no law or Senate 
rule but exercised poor judgment in aiding a savings and loan 
owner. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff also represented Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va., when a federal  
grand jury declined to charge him in a political eavesdropping 
investigation during the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	A graduate of Swarthmore College and Columbia Law School who  
uses a wheelchair as a result of polio, Ruff is former president of 
the District of Columbia bar and is highly regarded in Washington 
for his legal ability and integrity. 
</P>
<P>
	One trouble spot occurred in 1993, when Clinton bypassed him as  
a candidate for the No. 2 job at the Justice Department partly 
because Ruff hadn't paid Social Security taxes for a household 
worker. 
</P>
<P>
	Barcella says Ruff's decisions as U.S. attorney were ``based on  
the right thing and legal thing to do'' and were not swayed by 
politics. They had plenty of disagreements, Barcella says, but he 
never doubted his motives. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Watergate prosecutor James Neal, who now represents Vice  
President Al Gore, worked alongside Ruff representing Exxon when it 
faced criminal charges over the Exxon Valdez oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will know his case when he comes into the courtroom,'' Neal  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neal said he liked Ruff's ``sort of sardonic line'' to the House  
Judiciary committee when he suggested that someone who was trying 
to obstruct justice wouldn't give a gift to someone and then try to 
get it back the same day. 
</P>
<P>
	Heymann praised Ruff for ``coolness under pressure'' and said,  
``If I were in trouble I would like to have Chuck represent me. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know that Chuck Ruff's the guy you want if you want to  
tear apart the opposition,'' Heymann said, but added, ``I don't 
think you want that here.''

<HEADLINE> Aetna To Allow Members To Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Aetna-U.S. Healthcare will let its six million  
HMO members appeal denials of insurance coverage to independent 
doctors, a move consumer groups praised because it shows the health 
plan is placing medical concerns over the need to contain costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a great move,'' said Charlie Inlander, president of  
the People's Medical Society, a national consumer health group 
based in Allentown, Pa. ``It's something consumers have wanted for 
long time,'' he said. ``It shows health care consumerism is really 
working.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna is not the first plan to offer such an external review  
process, but it will be the biggest when the new program gets 
underway in July. The HMO, which will grow by an additional 2 
million members after completing the purchase of Prudential Health 
Care, has agreed to be bound by the decisions of the independent 
doctor committees. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighteen of the 30 states where Aetna operates-- including  
Florida, Pennsylvania and New Jersey -- already have laws that give 
HMO members the right to appeal to outside review panels. And the 
federal government for nearly a decade has let Medicare HMO members 
appeal coverage decisions to an independent review board. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton proposed a nationwide HMO external review  
system last year as part of his ill-fated HMO consumer protection 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups were cautious about some aspects of Aetna's  
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, while consumers often complain about their HMOs,  
only a small percentage actually appeal decisions to the boards. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer groups said the plan will work only if patients  
know about it and can easily access it. Aetna promises to heavily 
promote the option, which is available only after a patient has 
gone through the company's internal appeals system. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, who chooses the review organization could be  
problematic. In some states such as New Jersey or Pennsylvania, 
state law requires the state to choose the review board. Where no 
such regulation exist, Aetna will pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna will pay the cost of the reviews -- which can range from  
$250 to several thousand dollars-- except in those states which 
require consumers to pay a small filing fee. 
</P>
<P>
	Once all necessary information is submitted, external reviews  
will be decided within 60 days, though quicker responses will be 
available in urgent cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe external review will bring a new degree of trust  
into the relationship among physicians, members, and the health 
plan,'' Dr. Arthur Leibowitz, Aetna's chief medical officer, said 
Tuesday. ``This policy not only reaches out to protect the 
interests of the member involved in a specific case, but... it will 
help us gain greater understanding about how managed care can work 
best for the consumer.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warns Japan on Steel Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- If Japan doesn't act quickly to halt a flood  
of cheap steel coming into the United States, it will face U.S. 
trade sanctions, the Clinton administration bluntly told Japan's 
top trade official Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Japanese Trade Minister Kaoru Yosano insisted that his  
government could make no commitment to stem a flood of foreign 
steel although he said he expected those shipments to fall this 
year based on forecasts made by Japanese companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Yosano said both countries ``should act discreetly and  
cautiously so this does not development into unnecessary trade 
friction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the administration, watching America's trade deficit balloon  
to record levels, insisted at a separate briefing that it was 
prepared to follow up on a warning delivered by President Clinton 
last week and file a government trade complaint against Japan 
unless the steel shipments don't drop quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	While the steel industry and its main union have filed three  
cases already against Japan, Brazil and Russia accusing those 
nations of ``dumping'' steel in the U.S. market at unfair prices 
and seeking higher tariffs, the filing of a case by the government 
would allow the administration to impose tough quotas on the amount 
of steel Japan could ship to the United States. It would provide 
quicker relief than the dumping cases, which are not expected to be 
decided for several months. 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility of a quota case against Japan was raised by  
President Clinton in a report to Congress last week on the steel 
situation and in remarks the president made on the subject in a 
speech Friday in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky and Commerce  
Secretary William Daley met with Yosano to deliver the message 
personally on Tuesday in discussions that Barshefsky described as 
``very frank and blunt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not secret that trade tensions between the United States  
and Japan are increasing quite dramatically,'' she said. ``We 
stressed that the United States can't be the importer of only 
resort, which is our current situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	America's trade deficit surged in 1997 as global economic  
troubles cut into demand for U.S. exports and cheaper Asian 
currencies made those goods more competitive in the American 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	When all the data is collected, the deficit for 1998 is expected  
to have hit an all-time high of around $167 billion, compared to 
$110 billion in 1997, with forecasts for another record deficit 
this year as well. The administration is concerned that trade 
deficits of this magnitude will trigger a protectionist backlash in 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are all working to make sure the financial crisis of 1998  
does not become the trade crisis of 1999,'' Daley told reporters 
following the meeting with Yosano. 
</P>
<P>
	But Yosano, appearing at a separate briefing, said the Japanese  
government is not prepared to intervene in the free market to deal 
with the steel issue. He said that it is expected that Japanese 
steel shipments to the United States will decline in 1999 to the 
levels that existed before last year's surge of more than 400 
percent. But he said he was basing that on Japanese steelmakers' 
forecasts and not a government commitment. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Congress from steel-producing states expressed  
uniform disappointment in the administration's action plan to steel 
with the surge in steel shipments and vowed to push for tougher 
measures in Congress, but many conceded that they will face an 
uphill fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia, the Democratic chairman  
of the Senate steel caucus, said in an interview that lawmakers 
from the 16 states that produce steel are not numerous enough to 
overcome a propensity toward free-trade policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry officials say the surge in imports, which reached  
record levels in 1998, has already resulted in at least 10,000 
layoffs and a handful of company bankruptcies. 
</P>
<P>
	David Phelps, executive director for the American Institute for  
International Steel, said he expects ``cooler heads will prevail.''

<HEADLINE> Bivins, Arum Top Boxing Hall List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANASTOTA, N.Y. (AP) -- Jimmy Bivins never got a title shot. Now  
he's getting something better: a lasting place in the International 
Boxing Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	While Bivins was never a champion, he easily qualifies to be  
listed with boxing's greatest. He defeated eight future world 
champions, and for four years during boxing's Golden Era, he was 
unbeatable. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about time. I knew one of these days they would recognize  
me,'' Bivins said in a gleeful voice that broke into a laugh as he 
talked from his home in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did the best I could. I'm glad it was appreciated,'' he  
added. 
</P>
<P>
	The 79-year-old Bivins is one of six living inductees chosen  
Tuesday for enshrinement on June 13th. Also honored were promoter 
Bob Arum, featherweight champion Eusebio Pedroza of Panama, bantam 
great Khaosai Galaxy of Thailand, publicist Irving Rudd and 
celebrated English manager Mickey Duff. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven others will be inducted posthumously, including two-time  
featherweight champion Vincente Saldivar of Mexico and lightweight 
champion Lew Jenkins. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a short time ago, it seemed the world had forgotten about  
Bivins, who ranked as the top light-heavyweight and heavyweight 
contender during the early part of his career from 1940 until 1955. 
</P>
<P>
	Last April, police found him in the attic of his daughter's  
house. He was covered with bedsores, soiled by his own wastes and 
barely weighed 110 pounds -- about 70 pounds below his fighting 
weight. It took him two long hospital stays and three months in a 
nursing home to recover. His son-in-law last month pleaded guilty 
to criminal neglect. 
</P>
<P>
	In his prime, the 5-foot-9 Bivins was a fighting machine.  
Although he never had a title bout, Bivins met 11 future world 
champions and left the ring with his hand raised over eight of 
them, including Gus Lesnevich, Joey Maxim, Ezzard Charles and 
Archie Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	From June 22, 1942, until February 25, 1946, Bivins went 27-0-1,  
before losing to Jersey Joe Walcott. 
</P>
<P>
	While reigning champ Joe Louis was in the service during World  
War II, Bivins earned the title of ``duration'' champion for two 
years by defeating Tami Mauriello in a 10-round decision at Madison 
Square Garden. He finished his career with an 86-25-1 record with 
31 knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Bivins was inducted as a modern-era fighter, along with Galaxy  
and Pedroza. Jenkins and Saldivar also were honored as modern-era 
representatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Regarded as a national treasure in his homeland, Galaxy  
dominated the junior bantamweight division in the 1980s, with a 
record 19 successful title defenses during the division's longest 
uninterrupted reign (7 years, 1 month). His relentless attacking 
style was so fierce that only three boxers were able to last the 
distance in title fights against him. He finished with a record of 
49-1 with 43 knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Pedroza was known as an intelligent boxer with a ruthless  
streak. For more than seven years, Pedroza kept the world 
featherweight title, fending off such challengers as Ruben 
Olivares, Rocky Lockridge and Juan Laporte. He lost the title to 
Barry McGuigan in June 1985. Pedroza finished with a record of 
42-6-1 with 25 knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Arum, Duff and Rudd were selected as non-participants, a class  
for non-boxers who have made significant contributions to the 
sport. Honored posthumously were Italian publisher and historian 
Guiseppe Ballarati, columnist-publicist Murray Goodman and famed 
turn-of-the-century managers and promoters Jimmy Johnston and Tom 
O'Rourke. 
</P>
<P>
	Arum has been one of boxing's most prominent promoters since  
1966, when he promoted the first fight he ever attended, Muhammad 
Ali v. George Chuvalo. In 1980, he began the Top Rank Boxing 
series, which became one of ESPN's highest-rated regular shows. 
Among the matchups he has brought to the ring were Arguello v. 
Pryor, Leonard v. Hagler, Hagler v. Hearns and Ali v. Spinks II. 
</P>
<P>
	Duff, a veteran British fight matchmaker, manager and promoter,  
has been involved in the careers of nearly every world class 
British fighter, including Joe Bugner, Alan Minter and John Conteh. 
He has had 16 world champions. 
</P>
<P>
	Rudd left his impact as one of boxing's greatest sports press  
agents, working with everyone from Joe Louis to Muhammad Ali to 
Sugar Ray Leonard. He's also served as publicist for three of 
boxing's premier promoters: Mike Jacobs, Don King and Arum. 
</P>
<P>
	The hall's panel of boxing writers and historians also selected  
inductees in a pioneer class that recognizes individuals from prior 
to 1892 and in an old-timers category that honors those involved in 
the sport in the era between 1893-1942.

<HEADLINE> Court Reviews Scope of Cop Searches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawyers for Wyoming and the Clinton  
administration urged a seemingly sympathetic Supreme Court on 
Tuesday to let police sometimes search the personal belongings of 
all passengers inside motor vehicles stopped for traffic 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
	A rule always denying such authority would be ``very difficult  
for police to apply (and) might be exceedingly unworkable,'' 
Justice Department lawyer Barbara McDowell argued. 
</P>
<P>
	The court's decision, expected by July, could provide important  
new guidelines on police powers and personal privacy for situations 
that daily arise countless times nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	One such incident occurred in 1995 when a car driven by David  
Young was stopped for speeding on Interstate 25 in Natrona County, 
Wyo., in the early morning hours. After a Highway Patrol officer 
saw a hypodermic syringe in Young's pocket, Young said he had used 
it to take drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	During the ensuing search, two other officers asked the car's  
two female passengers to get out the car. One of them, Sandra 
Houghton, left her purse on the car's back seat. Inside it, police 
found drug paraphernalia and liquid methamphetamine. 
</P>
<P>
	She was convicted on a felony charge, but appealed.  
</P>
<P>
	The Wyoming Supreme Court threw out her conviction last April,  
ruling that police were justified only in searching the car for 
drugs Young may have had with him -- and therefore could not search 
Houghton's purse. 
</P>
<P>
	McDowell and Wyoming Deputy Attorney General Paul Rehurek urged  
the justices to overturn the Wyoming court's ruling. They said 
police had reason to think Young had drugs in the car, and the 
officers therefore should have been allowed to search any container 
-- including Houghton's purse -- that might hold the illegal goods. 
</P>
<P>
	At times, the lively hour-long argument session appeared to  
place the rationales of two past Supreme Court decisions on a 
collision course. 
</P>
<P>
	The court in 1948 ruled that police generally may not search  
passengers in a stopped vehicle without some reason to believe 
they, as opposed to the driver, have broken some law. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1982, the justices said once police reasonably believe a  
vehicle contains drugs or some other illegal goods they are free to 
search any container in that vehicle where the contraband might be 
hidden. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist suggested that the 1982  
decision was aimed at providing police with a ``bright line rule'' 
because previous rulings had ``hopelessly confused the issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rehnquist said he worried the Wyoming court's ruling would  
return courts to ``that case-by-case thing where nobody is going to 
know what the rule is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Stephen G. Breyer, Sandra Day  
O'Connor and Antonin Scalia also voiced doubts about the state 
court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	But Justices David H. Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg voiced  
concern that the legal rationale to let police search passengers' 
personal belongings would also allow searches of their clothing as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could be concealed in the pocket as easily as in the  
purse,'' Souter said at one point. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheyenne lawyer Donna Domonkos, representing Houghton, urged the  
court to adopt a rule that would protect passengers and items 
believed to be their personal belongings from being searched unless 
police have ``probable cause'' to believe those passengers of a 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Wyoming vs. Houghton, 98-184.

<HEADLINE> Bivins, Arum Picked for Boxing Hall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANASTOTA, N.Y. (AP) -- He defeated eight future world champions  
and was unbeatable for four years during boxing's Golden Era. Yet 
Jimmy Bivins' name is nowhere to be found on the list of the ring's 
supreme rulers. 
</P>
<P>
	After a brush with death last year, Bivins has emerged from  
obscurity to take his place among boxing's greatest names as one of 
the International Boxing Hall of Fame's 1999 induction class. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was one of the most remarkable boxers of all time. This is  
where he belongs,'' said the hall's executive director, Edward 
Brophy. ``This is where he always belonged.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 79-year-old Bivins was one of six living inductees chosen

<HEADLINE> Automakers Form Auto Trade Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and seven  
foreign-owned companies have formed a new trade group for 
automobile manufacturers, a move reflecting the growing 
globalization of the auto industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives from the nine companies announcing the Alliance  
of Automobile Manufacturers today said it will focus on issues of 
agreement among the world's automakers rather than more contentious 
areas such as trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``The formation of the group recognizes the huge amount of  
change we're seeing in the industry,'' said Peter J. Pestillo, vice 
chairman of Ford and the first chairman of the new association. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from GM and Ford, there will be four other companies with  
full voting rights in the new group: DaimlerChrysler AG, Volkswagen 
AG, Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co., the industry officials 
said. Those members will be on the executive board and vote on 
policy decisions. Any two voting members can veto a proposed 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Three foreign-based automakers, Volvo, BMW AG and Mazda Motor  
Corp., will be able to participate in meetings and discussions as 
associate members. 
</P>
<P>
	The association will have its headquarters in Washington and  
employ roughly 35 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the American Automobile Manufacturers Association,  
which represented the three domestic automakers, dissolved after 
Germany's Daimler-Benz acquired Chrysler Corp. AAMA's bylaws did 
not allow one of its members to be owned or controlled by a foreign 
corporation. 
</P>
<P>
	Chrysler officials favored keeping the association together and  
rewriting the bylaws to accommodate DaimlerChrysler, but Ford and 
GM said they instead preferred to form a new auto association. 
</P>
<P>
	The new and still evolving Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers  
will not be as powerful as the AAMA, which focused on opening 
markets overseas and enabled American automakers to often speak 
with one voice in lobbying government. 
</P>
<P>
	The new trade group will start with a smaller number of  
environmental and safety issues the domestic and foreign-based 
companies have in common as they learn to trust each other, auto 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Will there be rocky times? No doubt,'' Pestillo said.  
</P>
<P>
	GM, Ford and DaimlerChrysler still have their own in-house  
lobbyists. And the Association for International Automobile 
Manufacturers still represents 18 foreign-based automakers, 
including most of those in the new association. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda Motor Co. was invited to join the new Alliance of  
Automobile Manufacturers but declined. One point of friction is 
that Honda has been working to put cleaner cars on the road and 
wants to be viewed as a leader on environmental concerns. Domestic 
automakers have traditionally complained about the fuel economy 
requirements imposed by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this time, it would be in our best interests to remain with  
the Association for International Automobile Manufacturers,'' said 
Honda spokeswoman Barbara Ponce in Torrance, Calif.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets closed generally lower  
Monday, with share prices falling in Tokyo for a second consecutive 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 23.33  
points, or 0.17 percent, to close at 13,368.48. On Friday, the 
average fell 144.75 points, or 1.07 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices fell on lingering concern about the yen's recent  
rally against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	A stronger yen is viewed as bearish for shares of  
export-oriented companies as it makes Japanese exports more 
expensive abroad and reduces the value of dollar-denominated 
profits made overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 110.22 yen in late afternoon trading,  
down 1.20 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also below its late New 
York level of 110.93 yen Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices in Hong Kong closed lower after four straight  
sessions of gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, fell 88.43 points, or 0.8 percent, 10,634.27. Brokers 
said investors took profits following sharp gains last week. 
</P>
<P>
	News that the investment arm of one of China's wealthiest  
provinces has filed for bankruptcy, leaving debts worth $4.3 
billion, also dampened market sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from Guangdong International Trust and Investment  
Corp. announced the losses after a meeting of a committee 
overseeing the company's liquidation Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's record rally on Wall Street had little impact in Asia,  
traders said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 105.56 points 
to 9643.32, closing above the 9600 level for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	However, South Korean shares closed sharply higher on  
expectations of a recovery in the country's sluggish economy this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The South Korean central bank has said that it expects the  
economy to shift to a growth of 3.2 percent this year from a 
contraction of about 6 percent for 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 14.62 points, or 2.3  
percent, to 640.95. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed higher, with  
investors signaling their approval to a Cabinet reshuffle Friday 
when Abdullah Ahmad Badawi was appointed deputy prime minister. The 
benchmark Composite Index rose 6.76 points, or 1.1 percent, to 
598.46. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower on profit-taking. The market's  
key Weighted Stock Price Index fell 14.76 points, or 0.2 percent, 
to 6,406.99. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher, with brokers  
saying a rise by market heavyweight Telecom Corp. of New Zealand 
Ltd. buoyed sentiment. The NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 9.11 points, 
or 0.4 percent, to 2,169.40. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Share prices closed slightly lower on profit-taking. The  
30-company Philippine Stock Exchange slipped 1 point, or 0.05 
percent, to 2,139.64. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed mixed after profit-taking  
in blue chip industrial stocks countered a resource sector boosted 
by higher metals prices. The All Ordinaries Index fell 6.90 points, 
or 0.2 percent, to 2,849.4. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed lower as profit-taking eroded the  
market's early gains, dealers said. The Straits Times Index fell 
2.10 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,543.08. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Share prices closed lower on continued profit-taking in  
shares that rallied last week. The Composite Index fell 2.198 
points, or 0.5 percent, to 437.296. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed mixed, with the benchmark  
index slipping marginally lower on profit-taking. The Stock 
Exchange of Thailand (SET) index slipped 0.23 point to 399.20.

<HEADLINE> IRS Opens Web Problem Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mindful that its mistakes can affect lots of  
people, the IRS is now operating an Internet Web site to describe 
errors and what taxpayers should do about them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that even a little glitch in an IRS system can affect  
many thousands of taxpayers,'' IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti 
said Monday. ``They need to be alerted to the problem and what 
we're doing to fix it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Internal Revenue Service's ``special taxpayer alerts'' page  
-- located in the ``What's Hot'' section at www.irs.ustreas.gov -- is 
part of an IRS effort to ensure its just-completed overhaul of most 
key computers to comply with year 2000 does not cause undue 
hardship for taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS has spent 18 months rewriting an estimated 50 million  
lines of code to be ready for 2000, when some computers could go 
haywire if they mistakenly read the last two ``00'' digits as 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in excellent shape for this tax filing season, but we  
all know that glitches can occur in a system as large and as old as 
the IRS','' Rossotti said. 
</P>
<P>
	Examples of possible errors include huge tax notices, refund  
delays, mistakes in IRS publications or failure to properly credit 
taxpayer accounts. The Web site will enable the IRS to let people 
know if their particular problem has wider implications and what do 
to about it. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of business Monday, this was on the IRS Web site:  
``We have no problems to report to date.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But elsewhere on the Web site, the IRS had previously posted  
corrections to certain tax publications complete with links 
enabling people to download the new version. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Monday, the IRS unveiled a draft proposal providing $2  
million in grants to organizations that set up legal assistance for 
low-income taxpayers involved in tax disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	Each low-income tax clinic can qualify for up to $100,000 in  
grants, which will be awarded this summer. The taxpayer would pay a 
``nominal fee'' to be set later to receive the assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS already offers some tax dispute assistance to the poor  
and elderly, but not in a centralized clinic format that can also 
specialize in helping those for whom English is not the first 
language, said Marilyn Soulsburg, IRS assistant commissioner for 
customer service. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want taxpayers across the nation to have the same  
opportunity to get help,'' Soulsburg said.

<HEADLINE> Jury Gets Missing Secretary Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- There is no body, no murder weapon, no  
eyewitness. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, a jury must decide whether Thomas Capano killed his  
mistress or whether he lied for years to protect another lover. And 
the only person who has given any account of Anne Marie Fahey's 
death is Capano himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Capano is a politically connected lawyer from a wealthy Delaware  
family of developers. Ms. Fahey was the governor's secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	During closing arguments Wednesday in Capano's murder trial, his  
lawyers will ask the jury to trust his uncorroborated story that 
another mistress accidentally shot Ms. Fahey in a jealous rage and 
that he crammed her body in a cooler and dumped it at sea to keep 
her death a secret. 
</P>
<P>
	That other woman, Deborah MacIntyre, denied ever being at  
Capano's home the night Ms. Fahey died in 1996. She testified she 
bought Capano a gun at his request a month earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have satisfied our burden to our client,'' defense  
attorney Joseph Oteri said. ``We've opened up all kinds of 
possibilities for the jury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the possibilities come down to just two: Did Capano kill Ms.  
Fahey, as prosecutors say, because she wanted to end their secret 
affair? Or, as Capano says, did he just cover up an tragic, seamy 
accident? 
</P>
<P>
	If she was accidentally shot, ``there is not a reason in the  
world the defendant simply couldn't call 911,'' prosecutor Ferris 
Wharton said. 
</P>
<P>
	If Capano is convicted of first-degree murder, he could be  
sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
	If acquitted, he still could be charged with obstruction of  
justice. Also, the state has charged him with soliciting the 
murders of two witnesses against him, and the Fahey family has 
filed a wrongful death suit. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-month trial in this small, close-knit state has  
scraped away the public persona of a former prosecutor and trusted 
political adviser to reveal details of deceit and adultery that 
have sullied more reputations than his. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fahey, the governor's pretty, 30-year-old scheduling  
secretary, was a troubled woman who struggled with anorexia. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of Capano's brothers, members of a family that made a  
fortune building homes throughout the region, helped dispose of 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The testimony of Capano's sexual romps -- he is a 49-year-old  
father of four who has advised a former mayor and former governor -- 
embarrassed the state's chief deputy attorney, who admitted on the 
stand to having a sexual romp with Ms. MacIntyre that Capano 
arranged. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, though, it's a story about a young woman who fell in  
love with a powerful man who showered her with gifts but who later 
proved, according to her diary, to be a ``controlling, 
manipulative, insecure, jealous maniac.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fahey was last seen on June 27, 1996, having dinner with  
Capano in a Philadelphia restaurant. When police first questioned 
Capano, he said he had taken her home afterward and never saw her 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	In opening statements, Capano admitted for the first time that  
Ms. Fahey was dead and that he got rid of her body. He had lied all 
of this time, he later testified, to protect Ms. MacIntyre. 
</P>
<P>
	``I basically made the wrong decision, a cowardly decision, to  
get rid of the body,'' Capano testified. 
</P>
<P>
	There are no witnesses or concrete evidence that can show  
precisely how Ms. Fahey died, and none to corroborate Capano's 
story. No body was ever found. Nor was a murder weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have other evidence they believe shows Capano had  
murder on his mind -- telling his brother someone was extorting him, 
asking Ms. MacIntyre to buy him a gun, buying the cooler months 
before Ms. Fahey's death. 
</P>
<P>
	For Kathleen Fahey-Hosey, the case of her sister's death is  
simple. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anne Marie was shot. Anne Marie was stuffed in a cooler,'' she  
said. ``We have been surrounded by some very evil people.''

<HEADLINE> Kaczynski's Reward To Go to Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The family of convicted Unabomber Ted  
Kaczynski has set up a fund to distribute about $500,000 to victims 
of crimes committed by paranoid schizophrenics. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaczynski, a former Berkeley mathematics professor-turned  
backwoods hermit, was diagnosed by a prison psychiatrist as a 
paranoid schizophrenic. He was convicted last year and is serving a 
life prison sentence for 16 attacks that killed three people and 
injured 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Ted Kaczynski's brother, David Kaczynski, got a $1 million  
federal reward for turning his brother in. 
</P>
<P>
	David Kaczynski says he would have liked to have given more to  
victims, but taxes would have eaten up a greater portion of the 
reward. 
</P>
<P>
	Some $215,000 is expected to cover taxes the Kaczynskis will  
still have to pay and another $250,000 is going to pay the lawyer 
that worked with the family and federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the best we can do,'' David Kaczynski said Tuesday as  
he announced that he and his wife, Linda Patrik, are giving the 
money left over to the Albany branch of The Community Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	The charity will distribute the cash to people who were victims  
of crimes committed by paranoid schizophrenics. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kaczynskis can't earmark the money specifically for the  
victims or survivors and still get the tax exemption. But they have 
put some restrictions on where the money can go, and say they hope 
that the Unabomber's victims will apply for and get the funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Only people victimized between 1978 and 1995 in Connecticut,  
California, Utah, Illinois, Tennessee, Michigan and New Jersey are 
eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	``Within the restrictions, we would like as much of the money to  
go to victims of the Unabomber as possible,'' Patrik said. 
</P>
<P>
	David Kaczynski also said he's close to sealing a deal on the  
book and movie rights to the family's story, with any proceeds 
going to victims.

<HEADLINE> Cigna Sells Casualty Wing to Ace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Cigna Corp. is selling its international and  
domestic casualty insurance business to Ace Ltd., of Bermuda, for 
$3.45 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale, announced Tuesday, will allow Philadelphia-based Cigna  
to focus on its core health-care and employee-benefits operations, 
while letting Ace expand into an international property-casualty 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts expect Cigna, the nation's sixth largest managed care  
organization, to use the proceeds to buy a large regional HMO. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems clear that Cigna is in the health care business now,  
and they want to be a player,'' said John Erb, vice president of 
Gallagher Benefits Services in Boca Raton, Fla. ``In this era of 
consolidation, those proceeds are pretty likely to go toward 
acquisitions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Erb cited Humana and Oxford Health Care as two HMOs that Cigna  
might try to acquire. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal with Ace, which is subject to regulatory approval,  
includes Cigna's accident-and-health business, including products 
like travel insurance for individuals.

<HEADLINE> Eight Freshmen Get Senate Baptism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With its obscure procedures and customs, the  
Senate can be a curious place for any new arrival, any time. But 
this year's baptism for eight freshmen involves plunging into the 
century's only presidential impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't know your way around the underground tunnels yet,  
but you find yourself amidst one of the great constitutional 
confrontations of all time,'' said Sen. Peter Fitzgerald, R-Ill., 
one of the newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
	Freshman Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, said, ``It's a quick way  
to make you understand that you're a part of one of the most 
important bodies in the world. I get goose bumps thinking about 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Normally, newly minted senators would be spending a relatively  
leisurely January focusing on hiring staff, house-hunting and 
learning the ways of the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, they have stepped straight into the vortex of a  
constitutional, political and media maelstrom. Their schedules 
bulge with meetings, interview requests and time for poring over 
stacks of legal documents. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's intense,'' said Sen. Evan Bayh, D-Ind., his state's  
former governor. ``It's more than I was used to as governor, except 
in truly critical moments. I assume this is more than normal, but I 
have nothing to compare it to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How busy are they?  
</P>
<P>
	Voinovich canceled plans to return to Ohio last weekend to  
attend swearing-in ceremonies for state officials. Fitzgerald did 
the same, and has so far limited most interviews to Chicago-area 
news organizations to avoid being overwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
	And Sen. Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark., a former House member who  
returned to Arkansas two years ago, has been staying with friends 
because she has had little time to search for a home for her 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfailingly, the freshmen speak of the responsibility they bear  
and the awe they feel as jurors as the Senate considers whether to 
remove President Clinton from office. Only one other group of 
senators has performed this task: In 1868, when President Andrew 
Johnson was acquitted by a single vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``You really think, `What will my grandchildren read about  
this?''' said Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
	She is among four of the eight newcomers who previously served  
in the House and had at least indirect knowledge of what it would 
be like serving in the new chamber. Besides Lincoln, they are Sens. 
Jim Bunning, R-Ky.; Mike Crapo, R-Idaho; and Charles Schumer, 
D-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd rather be talking about the issues I ran on, like  
education and crime,'' said Schumer, who served on the House 
Judiciary Committee that issued the articles of impeachment against 
Clinton last month. ``I don't like having to do this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the others served in public office at home: Bayh;  
Voinovich, who was governor; and Fitzgerald, who was a state 
senator. While they are used to the give-and-take of politics, they 
now have to familiarize themselves with the national stage on which 
they are players. 
</P>
<P>
	Fitzgerald has a degree in classics from Dartmouth University  
and wrote his senior thesis on Cicero, the Roman orator. Yet he 
says he has been awed by the Senate's sense of tradition, and his 
fellow senators' knowledge of history. 
</P>
<P>
	After listening recently to 40-year Senate veteran Robert Byrd,  
D-W.Va., who regularly inserts historical references into his floor 
speeches, ``I took out an old college history text book, and I've 
been plowing through it,'' Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one of the eight is new to government: Sen. John Edwards,  
D-N.C., a successful trial attorney. Edwards says he is spending 80 
percent to 90 percent of his time dealing with impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no way we'd have time to spend on administrative  
things, legislative things,'' Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
	As was true for his colleagues, Edwards was asked often about  
impeachment during his campaign. Because of that and his lawyer's 
instincts for learning detail, he says he followed the case closely 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But that wasn't true for all of them. Voinovich says he was too  
busy to keep abreast of the details. At a recent dinner with his 
three grown children, he found that ``my kids know so much more 
about this than I do,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	There is one area in which the newcomers are even with most of  
their more experienced colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having been an executive, not a legislator, I'm not familiar  
with many of the procedural motions'' in the Senate's little-used 
impeachment process, said Bayh, the former governor. ``But then 
again, many of the other senators aren't, either.''

<HEADLINE>  Jordan News Hits Chicago Hard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Michael Jordan is set to leave basketball, and  
what awaits the Chicago Bulls and their fans does not look 
promising at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``Losers! Losers! Losers!'' Derrick Watt, a 32-year-old Chicago  
machinist, groaned Tuesday as he left the restaurant bearing the 
name of the basketball great. ``Without Michael, they'll be in the 
basement of their division.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As word of Jordan's expected retirement spread across Chicago,  
the realization set in that a championship era appears over. 
</P>
<P>
	``I probably won't watch the Bulls as much,'' said Richard  
Mabbun, 29, a computer network analyst. ``They'll be much less 
exciting without Jordan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But he went out the way everyone wants to go out -- right on  
top,'' Mabbun said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some fans thought the lockout spurred Jordan to end the greatest  
career in basketball history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I personally thought that he didn't want to be part of this  
season because it's so tainted,'' said Megan Brennan, 20, a 
University of Iowa student from Glen Ellyn. ``I'm glad that he left 
because I'm glad that he went out winning his last championship for 
the Bulls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Tim Moran, a 35-year-old Chicago lawyer, didn't think NBA  
championship No. 6 will be Jordan's last. He recalled Jordan 
retired once before and came back. 
</P>
<P>
	Moran said he thinks Jordan is so fed up with Bulls owner Jerry  
Reinsdorf and general manager Jerry Krause that he'll wait a year 
and go elsewhere. Jordan was close to coach Phil Jackson, who left 
after last season following years of stormy relations with 
Reinsdorf and Krause. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see him going to a different city to spite Reinsdorf and  
Krause,'' Moran said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Rosenberg, 31, a Toronto travel agent lunching at Michael  
Jordan's, said the superstar's departure was ``a shame for the 
game, not just for Bulls fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If he wants to move on he can leave at the top of his game,''  
Rosenberg said. ``If he sticks around and his skills start 
declining, everyone's going to say, oh, he should have retired 
three years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many fans, however, just couldn't imagine a Jordan slowed by  
age. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nah, he'll always have his skills, he's the greatest player  
ever,'' said Rose Cygen, 19, of Chicago, an employee of the United 
Center, the scene of so many of Jordan's exploits. 
</P>
<P>
	Beside her loomed the dramatic statue of Jordan, erected when he  
retired in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Sam Diaz, 25, an automatic teller technician who was passing the  
Jordan statue, said Jordan should come back. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I were him, I'd play the season, have a good time and get  
one more championship,'' Diaz said. He scoffed at the notion that 
Jordan, a month shy of his 36th birthday, might succumb to the 
ravages of age. ``I think he can handle another year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Calvin Short, 44, of Chicago, a United Center operations  
technician, wasn't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I enjoy watching him, but I think he's about played out,''  
Short said. ``I'd like to see him go out when he's not a has 
been.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kinyu Kuyama, a tourist from Hiroshima, Japan, was having lunch  
at the restaurant bearing Jordan's name. He said the Bulls 
superstar holds a special place in the hearts of his countrymen. 
</P>
<P>
	``They know Penny Hardaway, but Michael is special.''  
</P>
<P>
	He said there's still plenty for Jordan to do.  
</P>
<P>
	``He could take up golf,'' Kuyama said. ``PGA. The senior  
tour.''

<HEADLINE>  Jordan Walks While Bulls Wait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Steve Kerr stayed behind, practicing jump  
shots at the Chicago Bulls' practice facility while rookie Corey 
Carr shagged balls and watched. 
</P>
<P>
	The past and the future. Maybe the Bulls' present, too. With  
Michael Jordan's future finally decided, it's now up to the 
six-time champions to figure out theirs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does open up avenues now for everybody's future  
situation,'' said Dickey Simpkins, one of Chicago's many free 
agents. ``Obviously, Michael was the key to Chicago's decision on 
what their plans would be for the future. Now that everybody feels 
the decision is public, everyone can go on their course for the 
future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But first, the Bulls will let Jordan have his day. He's expected  
to announce his retirement Wednesday at the United Center, with 
Bulls chairman Jerry Reinsdorf and NBA commissioner David Stern 
flying in for the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Until then, no one -- not Reinsdorf, general manager Jerry Krause  
nor coach-in-waiting Tim Floyd -- will say anything. 
</P>
<P>
	Not even his teammates, who've known since June that he wasn't  
coming back, wanted to upstage Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course not,'' Kerr said when asked if he had any doubts  
Jordan was retiring. ``But I'm not going to be the fool who talks 
about it before it all happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When it's all done, though, the Bulls are going to have to do a  
lot of talking. There's the coaching matter to settle, first of 
all. Reinsdorf was waiting for word from Jordan before removing the 
``in-waiting'' tag from Floyd's title, so expect that to happen 
before the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	There are only four players under contract -- Ron Harper, Toni  
Kukoc, Randy Brown and Keith Booth -- from last year's championship 
team, with Harper the only starter. 
</P>
<P>
	They have a league-high 10 free agents. The Bulls must decide if  
they want to resign high-priced free agent Scottie Pippen and try 
to build around him -- possibly with some of their other free agents 
like Kerr, Luc Longley, Jud Buechler and Scott Burrell -- or rebuild 
from scratch. They also could resign Pippen and then trade him. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Krause said his first choice if Jordan retires would  
be to sign his own players and go after a few free agents. A youth 
movement is the last option. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have a couple of choices,'' Kerr said. ``You can draw  
your own conclusions as far as where I'd fit in there. I'd probably 
fit into plan B and maybe not into plan C. I don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until the Bulls renounce their rights to Jordan, though, they'll  
be over the salary cap and won't have money to do anything. But by 
getting rid of just a few of their free agents, they could clear 
enough money to make some big deals in a free-agent market that 
includes Antonio McDyess, Damon Stoudamire, Jerry Stackhouse and 
Rod Strickland. 
</P>
<P>
	And the wooing of McDyess has already begun.  
</P>
<P>
	``They want us to come in for a visit,'' James Bryant, the agent  
for McDyess, said Tuesday. ``We've talked with them, and right now 
Antonio is interested in looking at all the options. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll consider all factors, but their interest is coming  
late,'' Bryant added. ``With no free market, no one can be 
considered a front-runner. Obviously, the Suns have the advantage 
on the numbers side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That would appear to leave Rodman as the odd man out. Rodman  
made $8 million last season, and the Bulls aren't likely to want to 
give the multihued and tattooed rebounder that kind of money again. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't do me any good to speculate right now,'' Dwight  
Manley, Rodman's agent, said Tuesday. ``The next thing I have to do 
is talk to Jerry Krause. ... I owe it to them at least to talk to 
them first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just as Jordan's retirement alters the Bulls' plans, it also  
changes what the players might want. Playing with Jordan and 
challenging for a seventh championship in the 1990s is one thing. 
Being part of a rebuilding effort is another. 
</P>
<P>
	Players like Kerr and Longley already are attracting interest  
from other teams, and those teams may have more to offer than a 
rookie coach and an uncertain future. So even though they're still 
wearing Bulls T-shirts and shorts, they may be just a few days away 
from another uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a possibility from Game 6 in Salt Lake,'' Kerr said.  
``I've been prepared for this for a while. If this is what's 
happening, it's probably why he's doing it. So he can give the 
Bulls and the players their leeway that they need.''

<HEADLINE> BankAmerica Denies Job Cuts Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The newly merged BankAmerica Corp. plans to  
cut its global work force by about 18,000 jobs over the next three 
or four years, according to a published report Tuesday that the 
bank later denied. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman and chief executive Hugh McColl, in a meeting Monday  
with editors and reporters from the San Francisco Chronicle, said 
the cuts would come through layoffs and attrition. They would equal 
about 10 percent of the company's work force. 
</P>
<P>
	But spokeswoman Melba Spencer said BankAmerica is not planning  
such severe cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	McColl was merely ``speculating what the company's work force  
might look like three to four years in the future,'' Spencer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real point is there will be jobs eliminated and there will  
be new jobs opening up throughout the company in all of our markets 
as we respond to business needs,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	NationsBank Corp. and BankAmerica had said they intended to cut  
5,000 to 8,000 positions when they announced their merger pact in 
April, and that turnover would take care of many of the cuts. The 
combined company has about 180,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	McColl's NationsBank formally took over San Francisco's  
BankAmerica in September, taking the name but keeping the merged 
bank's headquarters in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	McColl was in San Francisco to answer critics who say the new  
bank has been insensitive to California's needs.

<HEADLINE> Resigned Fans Wish Jordan Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- For 13 seasons, Michael Jordan thrilled Chicago,  
making moves and hitting shots that seemed humanly impossible, 
giving the city six championships and countless memories. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that it appears over, his fans are repaying him the only way  
they can: with best wishes and heartfelt thanks for the wonderful 
ride. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will remember Michael Jordan as the best basketball player  
there ever was. We will all remember Michael making that last 
championship shot and that's a nice memory to have,'' said Brad 
Pollock, 28, who was in downtown Chicago today. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan plans to announce his retirement Wednesday at a news  
conference in Chicago, a source with close ties to the NBA told The 
Associated Press on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Gorrell, 45, of Naperville said he expected Jordan's  
decision to lead to a rebuilding of the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always painful to watch,'' Gorrell said. ``The Bulls are  
losing the player that makes them a team. The fabric of the team is 
changing and management can't do anything to save it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't sure Bulls' management will be able to keep fans  
interested. ``Let's face it, there is no franchise loyalty there is 
player loyalty. Unfortunately, management sometimes forgets that,'' 
Gorrell said. 
</P>
<P>
	As fans mourned Jordan's departure, they also questioned what it  
will mean for sports in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like someone is dying,'' said James Block, 28, of Buffalo  
Grove. ``The only team we have left with any hope of winning 
anything are the Cubs. And when the Cubs are the best team in 
Chicago that pretty sad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The news broke late in Jordan's adopted city, long after most  
residents had turned off their televisions and radios and gone to 
bed. Those who were awake, though, immediately flooded telephone 
lines at the city's all-sports radio stations to see if the news 
was true. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was crazy for a while,'' said Fred Huebner, host at WSCR.  
``The moment it came over, the phone lines lit up. It went from one 
or two calls to every phone line lit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It became almost like an Irish wake, with callers sharing their  
favorite Jordan memories and debating exactly which shot or game 
best symbolized his greatness. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think people are going to take to it too well, but I  
think everyone saw it coming,'' said Steve Reiter, the 
entertainment manager for the Cubby Bear Lounge, located across the 
street from Wrigley Field. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an easy way for Jordan to retire with the lockout and  
such. It was easy for him to bow out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And understandable. When he retired in October 1993, burned out  
and still reeling from his father's brutal death, his fans were 
stunned. He was at Comiskey Park for a White Sox playoffs game when 
the news spread, and soon all eyes were on him. The baseball game 
was forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
	But this time, fans are ready to let His Airness go. He has  
given so much joy to this city, and is adored like no one else. If 
this is what Jordan wants, good luck. His favorite coach is gone, 
and his last-second, championship-winning shot last June seemed 
like a fitting end. 
</P>
<P>
	He had all but retired at a golf tournament in July, saying he'd  
make a final decision when the lockout ended. Fans hoped he would 
change his mind as he did in 1995, when he came out of retirement. 
But they also braced themselves for the inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the most difficult things in the world is to go out  
while you are on top,'' Dick Mergener, 47, of Chicago said as he 
was reading the giant headlines about Jordan's likely departure in 
his morning paper. ``It reflects the class of the man, and the 
athlete, to leave the game now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But even if he's no longer playing, Jordan won't fade from this  
city's memory anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I go by the old adage that anyone's replaceable,'' Reiter  
said. ``But I think he's the exception to the rule. I don't think 
anyone can replace him.''

<HEADLINE> Man Charged in Comatose Nurse Rape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAWRENCE, Mass. (AP) -- A certified nurse's assistant was  
arrested Tuesday in the rape of a comatose nursing home patient who 
gave birth to a girl in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel Moret, an employee at the Town Manor Nursing and  
Rehabilitation Center, faces charges of rape and abuse of a patient 
in a long-term care facility, said Steve O'Connell, a spokesman for 
the Essex County district attorney's office. He is to be arraigned 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Moret was fired from Town Manor, the facility's administrator  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moret, 37, was taken into custody after authorities obtained DNA  
test results. Authorities had obtained voluntary samples from more 
than two dozen men who had access to the woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Moret is on the nurses' aide registry and has worked at the  
facility since 1995, said state Department of Public Health 
spokesman Mark Leccese. 
</P>
<P>
	Moret has a clean record and has never had a patient file a  
complaint against him, Leccese said. It wasn't clear whether he had 
an attorney Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	The victim, formerly of Londonderry, N.H., has been in a  
drug-induced coma since 1995. She was taken to Lawrence General 
Hospital from Town Manor in October after she appeared to be in 
discomfort. Doctors found a fetus, estimated at 26 to 27 weeks old. 
The victim was 24 at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Four days later the woman gave birth, 14 weeks prematurely. The  
baby remained in critical condition Tuesday at a Boston hospital, 
apparently having suffered brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman, who authorities have not identified because she is a  
rape victim, is being treated at another, undisclosed facility in 
Lawrence. 
</P>
<P>
	The birth sparked a custody battle, with the woman's parents  
seeking legal guardianship of their daughter and custody of their 
granddaughter. The state has been granted temporary custody of the 
baby pending a court hearing, scheduled for Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Ariz. Dr. Indicted in Patient Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- A doctor has been arrested on a manslaughter  
charge, accused of killing a patient who bled to death after her 
uterus was punctured during an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. John Biskind, who had been under investigation for months  
and had surrendered medical licenses in Arizona and Ohio, was 
indicted Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Also indicted was Carol Stuart, the administrator at the  
now-closed A-Z Women's Center, where Lou Anne Herron bled to death 
while under Biskind's care April 17. 
</P>
<P>
	``The conduct by Dr. Biskind is so outrageous it shocks the  
conscience,'' Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley said as he 
released the indictments. 
</P>
<P>
	Biskind has denied any wrongdoing. His attorney was out of his  
office late Tuesday and could not be reached for comment by The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy found that Herron, 33, had suffered a ruptured uterus  
during the late-term abortion. According to investigators, 
paramedics summoned by clinic staff found her lying on 
blood-drenched sheets. She had apparently been dead for some time. 
</P>
<P>
	Romley said Stuart had been indicted because she played an  
active role in the abortion. Like Biskind, she could face anything 
from probation to 12 1/2 years in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Last June, Biskind again came under scrutiny after an abortion  
attempt ended with a 17-year-old patient giving birth to a 
full-term baby girl with a fractured skull and lacerations. 
</P>
<P>
	Biskind reportedly had a test showing the teen pregnant for  
about 23.6 weeks. She actually was 37 weeks along.

<HEADLINE> Activists Speak in `McLibel' Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Multinational corporations should not be allowed  
to suppress criticism by filing libel suits, two vegetarian 
activists argued Tuesday as they sought to overturn a ruling that 
they libeled McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
	``The point of serving libel writs is not to have a court case  
but ... to have a 'chilling effect' on free speech,'' defendant 
Dave Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris, 44, and Helen Steel, 33, defended themselves in the  
``McLibel'' case, which at 314 days in court, spread over 2 1/2 years, 
was the longest trial in English history. 
</P>
<P>
	In June 1997, McDonald's won a judgment that it had been defamed  
by Morris and Steel, who had distributed pamphlets entitled 
``What's wrong with McDonald's? Everything they don't want you to 
know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it was a dubious victory. McDonald's is estimated to have  
spent $16 million on the case and did not bother trying to collect 
damages of $98,000 from the unemployed defendants. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also suffered the embarrassment of the trial judge's  
ruling that it was responsible for animal cruelty, that it 
exploited children through its advertising and that it paid its 
workers in Britain poorly. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge also ruled that substantial parts of Morris and  
Steel's leaflet were true. 
</P>
<P>
	In the start of their appeal Tuesday, Steel argued that a  
wealthy corporation can silence its critics simply by suing. The 
two had argued in the original case that their pamphlets were 
considered protected free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald's was due to outline its case later in the week. Its  
main attorney, Richard Rampton, estimated that arguments would take 
about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The scene at the Royal Courts of Justice underlined the  
imbalance between the combatants. McDonald's was represented by two 
barristers in wigs and black gowns, while Steel and Morris -- once 
again arguing their own cases -- wore sweaters.

<HEADLINE> Cigna Sells Casualty Wing to Ace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Cigna Corp. is selling its property and  
casualty insurance business to Ace Ltd., of Bermuda, for $3.45 
billion, the companies said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale will allow Philadelphia-based Cigna to focus on  
expanding its health insurance and employee-benefits operations. 
Analysts expect Cigna, the nation's sixth largest managed care 
organization, to use the proceeds to buy a large regional HMO. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems clear that Cigna is in the health care business now,  
and they want to be a player,'' said John Erb, vice president of 
Gallagher Benefits Services in Boca Raton, Fla. ``In this era of 
consolidation, those proceeds are pretty likely to go toward 
acquisitions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Erb cited Humana and Oxford Health Care as two HMOs that Cigna  
might try to acquire. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal with Ace, which is subject to regulatory approval,  
includes Cigna's accident-and-health business, including products 
like travel insurance for individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Cigna rose $1.38 to 84.88 in New York Stock Exchange  
trading.

<HEADLINE>  Jordan Walks While Bulls Wait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Steve Kerr stayed behind, practicing jump  
shots at the Chicago Bulls' practice facility while rookie Corey 
Carr shagged balls and watched. 
</P>
<P>
	The past and the future. Maybe the Bulls' present, too. With  
Michael Jordan's future finally decided, it's now up to the 
six-time champions to figure out theirs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does open up avenues now for everybody's future  
situation,'' said Dickey Simpkins, one of Chicago's many free 
agents. ``Obviously, Michael was the key to Chicago's decision on 
what their plans would be for the future. Now that everybody feels 
the decision is public, everyone can go on their course for the 
future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But first, the Bulls will let Jordan have his day. He's expected  
to announce his retirement Wednesday at the United Center, with 
Bulls chairman Jerry Reinsdorf and NBA commissioner David Stern 
flying in for the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Until then, no one -- not Reinsdorf, general manager Jerry Krause  
nor coach-in-waiting Tim Floyd -- will say anything. 
</P>
<P>
	Not even his teammates, who've known since June that he wasn't  
coming back, wanted to upstage Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course not,'' Kerr said when asked if he had any doubts  
Jordan was retiring. ``But I'm not going to be the fool who talks 
about it before it all happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When it's all done, though, the Bulls are going to have to do a  
lot of talking. There's the coaching matter to settle, first of 
all. Reinsdorf was waiting for word from Jordan before removing the 
``in-waiting'' tag from Floyd's title, so expect that to happen 
before the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	There are only four players under contract -- Ron Harper, Toni  
Kukoc, Randy Brown and Keith Booth -- from last year's championship 
team, with Harper the only starter. 
</P>
<P>
	They have a league-high 10 free agents. The Bulls must decide if  
they want to resign high-priced free agent Scottie Pippen and try 
to build around him -- possibly with some of their other free agents 
like Kerr, Luc Longley, Jud Buechler and Scott Burrell -- or rebuild 
from scratch. They also could resign Pippen and then trade him. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Krause said his first choice if Jordan retires would  
be to sign his own players and go after a few free agents. A youth 
movement is the last option. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have a couple of choices,'' Kerr said. ``You can draw  
your own conclusions as far as where I'd fit in there. I'd probably 
fit into plan B and maybe not into plan C. I don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until the Bulls renounce their rights to Jordan, though, they'll  
be over the salary cap and won't have money to do anything. But by 
getting rid of just a few of their free agents, they could clear 
enough money to make some big deals in a free-agent market that 
includes Antonio McDyess, Damon Stoudamire, Jerry Stackhouse and 
Rod Strickland. 
</P>
<P>
	And the wooing of McDyess has already begun.  
</P>
<P>
	``They want us to come in for a visit,'' James Bryant, the agent  
for McDyess, said Tuesday. ``We've talked with them, and right now 
Antonio is interested in looking at all the options. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll consider all factors, but their interest is coming  
late,'' Bryant added. ``With no free market, no one can be 
considered a front-runner. Obviously, the Suns have the advantage 
on the numbers side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That would appear to leave Rodman as the odd man out. Rodman  
made $8 million last season, and the Bulls aren't likely to want to 
give the multihued and tattooed rebounder that kind of money again. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't do me any good to speculate right now,'' Dwight  
Manley, Rodman's agent, said Tuesday. ``The next thing I have to do

<HEADLINE> Olympics Sponsors Seek Quick Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Most Olympics sponsors are awaiting results of  
investigations into allegations of bribery in the award of the 2002 
Winter Games to Salt Lake City before assessing if the games are 
still a valuable marketing vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	The phone company U S West announced last week it was delaying a  
$5 million sponsorship payment due by the end of this month because 
of the growing controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	But other sponsors said Monday they had done nothing to alter  
their marketing activities related to the Olympics, and some are 
continuing discussions on extending their Olympics deals past next 
year's Summer Games in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	The sponsors said they are hoping the reports are quick and  
complete and that Olympic officials will take steps to assure the 
integrity of the process under which cities are selected for the 
global athletic competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Two top Salt Lake City Olympic organizers stepped down last  
week, acknowledging that cash payments of as much as $70,000 were 
made to members of the International Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC is investigating the matter, as are the Salt Lake City  
Organizing Committee, the U.S. Olympic Committee and the Department 
of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
	David D'Alessandro, president of John Hancock Financial Services  
in Boston, said his company -- already a sponsor of the 2000 Games -- 
has been considering whether to sign on for the succeeding four 
years, which would include the Salt Lake City Games and the Summer 
Games in Athens in 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe the IOC will deal with the procedures for awarding  
sites and investigate past awards,'' he said. ``If the IOC fails to 
deal with it, then all sponsors will have to seriously reconsider 
whether to continue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for Xerox Corp., United Parcel Service, Eastman Kodak  
Co. and McDonald's Corp. also said they were awaiting the results 
of the investigations to assess the impact on the Olympic brand. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola Co., which has been an Olympics sponsor for 70 years,  
is already signed up through the 2008 Games, which have not yet 
been awarded. 
</P>
<P>
	Ben Deutsch, a Coca-Cola spokesman, said the growing scandal  
``certainly hurts'' but added, ``Until all of the findings are 
released, I don't think we are in a position to know how damaging 
it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the IOC's top marketing officer, Michael Payne,  
planned to meet this week individually with Coca-Cola and other 
worldwide Olympic sponsors on what was being done. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC also hired the public relations firm Hill &AMP; Knowlton to  
assist with communicating what the organization is doing and help 
release the findings of its report, due Jan. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Olympic Committee is still about $245 million short of  
the $859 million it needs to raise from sponsors for the Salt Lake 
City Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman Mike Moran said the committee had expected to raise  
the money by Aug. 1, but has now pushed the target back to Aug. 1, 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The money is part of the overall $1.45 billion budget for the  
Salt Lake City Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Hodler, the senior member of the IOC, warned Monday the  
games could be moved elsewhere or canceled if Salt Lake can't raise 
enough money.

<HEADLINE> Activists Against DiCaprio Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Environmentalists are hoping to sink  
Leonardo DiCaprio's latest film shoot. 
</P>
<P>
	Activists, local residents and hotel and tour operators have  
lined up against 20th Century Fox's plans to film ``The Beach'' on 
Phi Phi Island, 340 miles from Bangkok. They fear filming will harm 
Maya Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents say the film crew has removed the natural vegetation  
from the beach and planted 93 coconut trees. Activists have said 
that will cause erosion. 
</P>
<P>
	They were in court Tuesday seeking an emergency injunction to  
halt the production but were turned down. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have done our best for today, but it has to go according to  
legal procedures, so we will wait,'' said Warin Niemsakul, a lawyer 
for the activists.

<HEADLINE> Border Patrol Can Be Sued for Stops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The Border Patrol can be sued for allegedly  
stopping drivers in southern Arizona just because they look 
Hispanic, a federal appeals court has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 2-1 decision Tuesday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  
reinstated a class-action lawsuit on behalf of two groups: 
Hispanics who drive in an eight-county area of Arizona at any time, 
and people of any ethnicity who drive in the same area after dark, 
when agents allegedly can't tell whether a driver is Hispanic. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1995 lawsuit says both groups are commonly stopped without  
reasonable suspicion of illegal immigration. The ruling allows the 
drivers to try to prove their case. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have overwhelming evidence of a pattern and practice on the  
part of the Border Patrol to stop Hispanics because they were 
Hispanics,'' said Armand Salese, lawyer for the drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	Although such stops have been forbidden by federal court rulings  
for many years, a review of between 2,000 and 3,000 Border Patrol 
reports of driver stops shows that management ``is encouraging that 
officers turn a blind eye'' to those rulings, Salese said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit seeks no money damages, only court orders  
prohibiting stops of drivers without reasonable suspicion of 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Border Patrol's regional office in Laguna Niguel, which  
oversees officers in Arizona, did not return a telephone call 
seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit was dismissed in 1997 by U.S. District Judge John Roll,  
who said the two drivers could not sue on behalf of all motorists 
because the circumstances of every Border Patrol stop were 
different. He said they could not sue on their own behalf because 
they had failed to show a likelihood that they would be stopped 
illegally in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	But the appeals court said every vehicle stop covered by the  
suit had one thing in common: the lack of reasonable suspicion of 
wrongdoing.

<HEADLINE> UAW Leader Has No Position on GM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The United Auto Workers union hasn't taken a  
position yet on General Motors Corp.'s plans to radically overhaul 
the way it builds small cars in North America, UAW President 
Stephen Yokich said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Yokich spoke to an industry conference one day after GM on  
Monday outlined Project Yellowstone, a plan to replace some of the 
automaker's unprofitable assembly plants with more efficient ones 
as a way to stay in the small-car business. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan would result in smaller plants that use so-called  
modular assembly methods, in which suppliers would play a larger 
role and fewer GM autoworkers would be needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at an industry conference, Yokich said he will be  
briefed later this week by the UAW's head of GM relations, Richard 
Shoemaker, who has been working more closely with the automaker and 
UAW local leaders over plans for modular plants to replace older 
ones in Lordstown, Ohio, and Lansing, Mich.

<HEADLINE> LVMH Boosts Its Stake in Gucci </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Luxury and spirits group LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis  
Vuitton SA has increased its stake in Italy's Gucci Group NV, 
adding to speculation that the French group is angling for a 
takeover. 
</P>
<P>
	LVMH said Tuesday it has acquired the 9.5 percent stake that  
fashion house Prada held in Gucci for an undisclosed sum, bringing 
the French company's total Gucci holding to at least 14.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for LVMH suggested that the French luxury house  
could have bought additional Gucci shares on the market. LVMH will 
disclose its exact stake in Gucci to regulators in coming days and 
reveal its intentions. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors have been betting since last week that LVMH is  
planning to take over Gucci. Gucci shares -- which are traded in 
both Amsterdam and New York -- have risen 50 percent since the 
beginning of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	After rising sharply in recent days, Gucci stock dropped Tuesday  
on profit-taking. Its shares were down $4.50, or 6 percent, at 
$66.56 1/4 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say LVMH Chairman Bernard Arnault has been on the hunt  
for acquisitions in the luxury goods sector to offset the poor 
results of his cognac, perfume and luxury retail divisions. All 
three divisions have been battered by weak demand in Asia.

<HEADLINE> Lady Vols Back at No. 1 in AP Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Tennessee women are right back where they started.  
</P>
<P>
	Nine weeks after giving up the No. 1 ranking in The Associated  
Press basketball poll, the Lady Vols returned to the top Monday -- 
the day after winning a 92-81 showdown at Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee (13-1) received 39 of 41 first-place votes from a  
national media panel to move up from the No. 2 spot and displace 
Connecticut (13-1), which had led the poll for seven weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the best team in the country,'' Connecticut coach Geno  
Auriemma said. ``I've said that 100 times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lady Vols certainly are perceived as the best team now.  
They've won 12 straight since a 78-68 loss at Purdue in the second 
game of the season, and their average victory margin in that run 
has been 25 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut had a 54-game home winning streak broken by Sunday's  
loss and dropped to second. Purdue (11-1) held at No. 3 after 
escaping with an overtime victory at Iowa and received the two 
other first-place votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn was the lone newcomer, riding a seven-game winning streak  
into the poll at No. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee was ranked No. 1 in every poll last season en route to  
a 39-0 record and its third straight national championship, and 
coach Pat Summitt's team began this season as a unanimous choice 
for the top spot. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss at Purdue dropped the lady Vols to fourth and Purdue  
became No. 1 for the first time. The Boilermakers then lost at 
Stanford and were replaced at the top the next week by Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee received 1,023 points in the voting -- two short of the  
maximum. Connecticut had 967 points and Purdue received 945. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 4 Georgia (14-0) and No. 5 Louisiana Tech (12-2) kept the  
spots they held last week. Georgia has faced only two ranked teams 
this season, Alabama and Florida, but the Lady Bulldogs will get a 
chance to see how they measure up when they play at Tennessee on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 6 Texas Tech and No. 7 North Carolina traded places, and  
were followed by Colorado State, Notre Dame and UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
	Old Dominion remained at No. 11 and Duke moved up one spot to  
12th. Then it was Virginia Tech, Iowa State, Rutgers and Clemson, 
followed by Ohio State, Florida, Alabama and Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston College, Virginia, Kansas, Nebraska and Auburn held the  
final five places. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn (12-2) gained its first ranking since the week of Jan.  
13, 1997, when it was tied for 21st. This the 19th straight season 
the Tigers have appeared in the poll, and coach Joe Ciampi needs 
just one victory to reach 500 for his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Memphis, 24th last week, dropped out after a 47-point loss at  
Tulane. It was the second loss in three games for Memphis after a 
nine-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State made the biggest jump in the poll, going from 23rd to  
17th after victories over Wisconsin and Illinois. Boston College, 
which made the poll for the first time last week, won three games 
and jumped four places to 21st. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemson, 2-1 during the week, fell four places to 16th for the  
biggest drop within the poll. The Tigers' loss was to North 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn became the 36th team to make the poll this season. The  
record is 45 in the 1991-92 season.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Appeals Against U.S. Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Arab nations should condemn American and  
British airstrikes and the countries that supported them, the Iraqi 
leadership said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement was the latest in a series of appeals to Arab  
states to back Iraq and get the United Nations to lift trade 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Baghdad has been especially critical of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia,  
where British and American forces have bases. The Western countries 
also fly off ships in the Gulf and from Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any foreign aggression against any Arab country should be  
considered as an aggression on the Arab nation as a whole,'' said a 
statement issued after President Saddam Hussein met with senior 
government officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``Arab officials should adopt a clear and a defined stand to  
condemn and deplore the American-British aggression on Iraq and 
those who supported -- provided facilities, means and practical and 
political backing for -- the aggression,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement, carried on the official Iraqi News Agency,  
appeared timed to influence Arab foreign ministers scheduled to 
meet Wednesday in Egypt and Saudi Arabia to prepare for the 
22-member Arab League session Jan. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and Britain launched airstrikes against Iraq  
from Dec. 16-19, to punish the Baghdad regime for failing to 
cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors. The inspectors must certify 
that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction, as 
required by 1991 Gulf War cease-fire resolutions, before sweeping 
trade sanctions can be lifted. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Tuesday, a U.S. warplane fired a missile at an Iraqi  
radar site in the north, the latest in a series of confrontations 
in the ``no-fly'' zones since the December airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	The aircraft returned to base safely. There were no reports of  
Iraqi casualties or damage. Iraq has vowed to defy the northern and 
southern zones, set up by the United States and its allies to 
protect anti-government rebels.

<HEADLINE> The Journal Relives the Year 1,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Explorer Leif Ericsson has disclosed plans to  
sail to Greenland, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wait a minute! This isn't news. It's old. Really old.  
</P>
<P>
	The item on Ericsson was among the dispatches in a mock special  
edition looking back over the past millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	The front page, dated Jan. 1, 1000, looked exactly like the  
usual Journal, with the same typefaces and layout, but contained a 
chart of interest rates in Rome and Byzantium and articles such as 
``Spice Goals: Seafarers from Asia Delight Europe's Elite With 
Exotic Flavorings,'' ``It's Education, Stupid: Why East Leads 
West'' and ``No Apocalypse Now; Y1K Anxiety Ends, But World 
Doesn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In the end, it wasn't the end,'' the Y1K story began.  
``Despite fire-and-brimstone predictions in the Bible's Book of 
Revelation, there was not a great earthquake. The sun did not turn 
black like sackcloth. The moon did not turn blood red. And stars in 
the sky did not fall to earth. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doomsayers are dumbstruck.''  
</P>
<P>
	Planning for the 56-page edition, which was inserted into  
Monday's regular newspaper, began about a year ago, editor Lawrence 
Ingrassia said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a spoof,'' Ingrassia said. ``It may be  
entertaining for readers, but it certainly is not a spoof.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We went about this by reporting it like we would any other  
story -- tapping a variety of sources, historical records. We also 
interviewed experts and bounced ideas off them,'' Ingrassia said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 50 reporters and editors around the world contributed.  
</P>
<P>
	Some of the items from the mock front page's ``What's News''  
column included revelations that ``Vikings earned substantial 
profits from Slavic slave trade as sales to Constantinople 
increased,'' and ``Horseshoe prices rose in Europe. ... As a 
result, horses with horseshoes now sell for twice as much as 
shoeless horses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other features included a look at ``Fifty of the Wealthiest  
People of the Past 1,000 Years.'' The Khans (Genghis and Kublai) 
made the top 50, as did Henry VIII, Cosimo de Medici, Nathan 
Rothschild, Cornelius Vanderbilt, Andrew Carnegie, J. Paul Getty 
and Bill Gates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal also spotlighted great economic thinkers of the  
millennium, including St. Thomas Aquinas, Adam Smith, Karl Marx and 
Milton Friedman. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper also examined how the rich got rich, how the poor  
have been treated, the greatest technological innovations, how 
eyeglasses changed the world, and the evolution of mass-production 
techniques.

<HEADLINE> 3 Take Pleas To Avoid Gotti Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- John A. ``Junior'' Gotti says he's  
willing to go to trial alone, and it's beginning to look like he 
might. 
</P>
<P>
	The list of Gotti's codefendants, which once had 22 names on it,  
fell to seven Monday when three graying gangsters agreed to plea 
bargains. Negotiations are under way with more defendants. 
</P>
<P>
	John ``Jackie the Nose'' D'Amico, 62, admitted running a  
Connecticut-based illegal gambling business. In exchange, 
prosecutors said they would not object to any sentence of at least 
21 months in prison. There is no provision for D'Amico to cooperate 
with the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Amico could have been sentenced to up to 20 years if convicted  
of racketeering charges that included loansharking and extortion. 
The indictment said he was a capo with ``supervising authority'' in 
the Gambino crime family, resolving disputes and directing criminal 
activity. D'Amico allegedly had helped run the crime family -- with 
John A. ``Junior'' Gotti -- since the elder Gotti was imprisoned in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The other men who pleaded guilty in federal court, Louis ``Louie  
Bracciole'' Ricco, 69, and ``Little Mario'' Antonicelli, 68, 
admitted to racketeering, specifically involvement with 
extortionate loans that carried an ``implied threat of violence'' 
if unpaid. Prosecutors said Ricco would serve at least 46 months, 
Antonicelli 41 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, ``Junior'' Gotti, who faces up to 20 years if  
convicted of racketeering, extortion and fraud, refused a plea deal 
that would have brought him about eight years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	More guilty pleas are expected.  
</P>
<P>
	``We won't mind sitting alone at this trial, if it comes to  
that,'' said Sarita Kedia, a Gotti lawyer. ``That way, we won't be 
clouded by any proof offered against any other defendant.''

<HEADLINE> California TV Ignored Gov. Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- California TV stations reaped tens of  
millions of dollars by saturating the airwaves with paid political 
ads last fall, but their news departments practically ignored the 
governor's race. 
</P>
<P>
	TV stations in the state's biggest media markets devoted less  
than one-third of 1 percent of their news programs to the nation's 
most important gubernatorial race, according to the study by the 
University of Southern California Annenberg School for 
Communication. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, two-thirds of the coverage focused on political  
strategy and insider maneuvering, rather than issues, said Matthew 
Hale, a researcher on the project. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Reese, a California coordinator of the Alliance for  
Better Campaigns, which seeks to improve televised political 
coverage, said the study was ``startling to even those of us who 
suspected the worst.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hale and fellow researcher Martin Kaplan employed an outside  
service that monitored 8,664 hours of local news in Los Angeles, 
San Francisco, Bakersfield, San Diego and Sacramento between Aug. 
10 and Nov. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	They found that local coverage of the gubernatorial race between  
Republican Dan Lungren and the eventual winner, Democrat Gray 
Davis, amounted to 26 hours and 57 minutes, or .31 of 1 percent of 
all local news. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaplan and Hale said that even if they struck sports, weather  
and advertisements from the category of total programming, the 
proportion of political coverage would still be very low. 
</P>
<P>
	Between them, Davis and Lungren raised $60 million for their  
campaigns, most of which was spent on television advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could do more coverage of politics and in particular of the  
gubernatorial race,'' said Ed Chapuis, news director at KCRA-TV in 
Sacramento. ``But it's a two-way street -- we need to have more 
access to the politicians.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Soars Vs. Yen, Off Vs. Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar soared against the yen Tuesday as the  
Bank of Japan's intervention in foreign exchange markets reversed 
the ascent of the Japanese currency, which was fueling the rising 
costs of exports. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the dollar fell against other major currencies,  
including the euro, which rose to $1.1555 in late New York trading 
from $1.1542 Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 112.43 Japanese yen in New York, up from  
108.93 yen late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the Bank of Japan spent $1 billion to $2 billion in  
foreign exchange markets as it dumped yen. The dollar, after 
sliding from a high of more than 147 yen in August to a 28-month 
low on Monday, rose more than 4 yen on the back of the surprise 
intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's today's story. The intervention got people thinking  
that if we go lower (with the dollar) the BOJ will hit us with more 
dollars,'' said Jay Bryson, an international economist at First 
Union Capital Markets in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryson said that the strengthening yen was causing exporters'  
profits to fall as their goods became more expensive overseas. 
Japan is counting on expanding exports to help it recover from its 
worst recession in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, as the yen was ascending, the economy seemed to be  
stabilizing: Industrial production had stopped collapsing and 
household spending was starting to rise. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't have this falloff in economic activity that we had  
had before,'' Bryson said, adding that the intervention came as BOJ 
officials became increasingly worried that a possible recovery was 
stalling. ``They were getting nervous the yen was getting too 
strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the dollar rose following the intervention, it started  
slipping until U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin reiterated the 
U.S.'s longstanding monetary policy that a strong dollar is good 
for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Rubin has used the phrase sparingly during the past  
three months, the market latched onto the remark and the dollar 
immediately rose again. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, investors fearful about the United States' heavy  
exposure in Brazil panicked as the index on Latin America's largest 
stock exchange fell as much as 9 percent during the trading day 
before closing down 7.6 percent. Investors dumped dollars for 
euros. 
</P>
<P>
	``These concerns about Brazil are starting to weigh against the  
dollar again,'' Bryson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also fell to 1.3887 Swiss francs from 1.4003 Monday  
but rose to 1.5125 Canadian dollars from 1.5065. The British pound 
slid to $1.6308 from $1.6319. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Monday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.6926 German 
marks, down from 1.6946 late Monday; 5.6786 French francs, down 
from 5.6818; 1,675.04 Italian lire, down from 1,677.85.

	WIESBADEN, Germany (AP) -- Germany had a $9.88 billion trade  
surplus in November, putting itself in position to post a record 
surplus for 1998, the Federal Statistics Office said today. Some 
economists had expected the month's trade surplus to shrink from 
October's $7.46 billion, fearing the impact from weaker exports 
resulting from economic instability overseas, particularly in Asia.

	Infamous Drug Is Making a Comeback

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Thalidomide, approved by regulators in July to  
treat a complication from leprosy, is making a comeback extending 
well beyond that rare disease. Some doctors are prescribing it for 
some of the deadliest cancers even though tests have yet to 
definitively prove it works. Wall Street seems to have already 
decided. Shares in Celgene Corp., the only U.S. seller of 
thalidomide, have more than doubled in the past month -- to about 
$16 -- after the company bought marketing rights to the drug from 
its closest rival.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Favorable weather helped produce record  
soybean and large corn crops last year, but a drought followed by 
fierce storms hurt cotton production, the Agriculture Department 
reported today. Soybean production for 1998 totaled 2.76 billion 
bushels, the highest on record. Last year's figures are 3 percent 
higher than 1997, which had set a record with 2.69 billion bushels. 
Corn also had a good year with production estimated at 9.76 billion 
bushels, up 6 percent from the 1997 crop. Last year's corn crop 
ranks second behind the record 10.1 billion bushels produced in 
1994. But the 1998 wheat crop is estimated at 2.55 billion bushels, 
down slightly from earlier estimates but still 3 percent higher 
than 1997.

tax from $3 to $5, The Associated Press has learned. The passenger 
facility charge, or PFC, is a tax requested by local governments 
and earmarked for improvements at their airports. It must be

ticket -- equal to four $3 charges per round trip -- but would rise 
to a maximum of $20 a ticket under the administration proposal.

today. ``In 1999, we are seeing the beginning of recovery in 
Asia,'' said Lee Tsao Yuan, director of Singapore's think-tank

<HEADLINE> NFL Coaching Carousel Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Ray Rhodes and Andy Reid traded addresses in the NFL's latest  
rendition of the coaching carousel. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes, fired by the Philadelphia Eagles two weeks ago, was  
hired Monday to coach Green Bay. Reid, the Packers' quarterbacks 
coach, was hired by the Eagles to replace Rhodes. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Monday, Kansas City coach Marty Schottenheimer resigned  
after a 7-9 season, his first losing campaign since he became an 
NFL coach in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	For Rhodes, the move from Philadelphia to Green Bay takes him  
from one of the league's worst franchises to one of its best. He 
replaces Mike Holmgren, who led the Packers to six straight 
postseason berths, two NFC championships and a Super Bowl title. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look at the football team and everything around it,  
you are in awe,'' said Rhodes, who reportedly signed a four-year 
deal at about $1 million a season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to compare the Philadelphia Eagles football team  
with the Green Bay Packers,'' Rhodes said. ``That is not fair to 
anybody. We were never able to get the core players that this team 
has here right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes is one of only three black head coaches in the NFL, all  
in the NFC Central Division. Minnesota's Dennis Green and Tampa 
Bay's Tony Dungy are the others. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers, done in by injury and inconsistency, slipped to  
11-6 this season, losing a wild-card playoff game at San Francisco 
and leaving Holmgren with an 84-42 mark, second only to Vince 
Lombardi in the team's 80-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	The team still has a solid nucleus, including Brett Favre,  
Antonio Freeman, Dorsey Levens, LeRoy Butler and Vonnie Holliday 
and averted a free agency plunge by re-signing tight end Mark 
Chmura and right tackle Earl Dotson. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Packers have to replace defensive end Reggie White and  
need to shore up a suspect secondary. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, what you do is you pull a few spark plugs out, you  
wipe them off,'' Rhodes said. ``You make sure you keep the car 
fine-tuned. That is what we intend to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reid has a much taller task, leaving one of the league's most  
potent offenses for a team that was last in the NFL in scoring with 
161 points -- 80 fewer than the next worst team. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatively unknown and inexperienced, Reid, 40, faces the task  
of turning around a team that was 3-13 this season and has a 
limited talent base, but the No. 2 pick in April's draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid, the second youngest coach in the league to Oakland's Jon  
Gruden, 35, has never been a head coach at any level and is the 
first to jump from position coach to head coach since Art Shell 
with the Raiders in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'm able to give this organization the offense that  
has won a tremendous amount of rings in the National Football 
League,'' said Reid, who studied the West Coast offense as a member 
of Holmgren's staff for seven years. ``I'd never put myself in a 
bad situation. I feel very confident that this organization can 
win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reid is the latest Holmgren assistant to earn a head coaching  
job in the NFL, joining Rhodes, Gruden and San Francisco's Steve 
Mariucci. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mike Holmgren was a great teacher, not only to his players but  
to his coaches,'' said Reid, who signed a five-year deal believed 
to be worth $1 million a year. ``That speaks highly of him, and I 
would be very foolish not to study that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas City, considered a Super Bowl contender when the season  
started, was beset by injuries and the most penalties in the NFL to 
end up as one of the league's biggest disappointments. 
</P>
<P>
	``After 10 years it's time to give someone else an opportunity  
to implement their plan,'' said Schottenheimer, 101-58-1 with the 
Chiefs. ``I've decided to take a break, to take some time and 
relax.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Schottenheimer, the frustration culminated with a Monday  
night game in November when the Chiefs committed five personal 
fouls on Denver's final touchdown drive in a 30-7 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	A seething Schottenheimer apologized and said he'd never been so  
embarrassed. Owner Lamar Hunt called the episode a disgrace to the 
team and the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunt said he reluctantly accepted Schottenheimer's resignation,  
adding it marked the end of ``golden era'' for the Chiefs. The 
owner said he twice asked Schottenheimer to reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate word on Schottenheimer's successor. The  
Ravens, Bears and Browns are also still searching for coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	When all the hiring is done, nine of 31 teams, including the  
expansion Browns, will have new coaches.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers Spar in Deadly Gondola Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- Showing photos of a crushed Italian  
ski gondola will only serve to inflame the passions of jurors 
hearing manslaughter charges against two Marine aviators, defense 
lawyers say. 
</P>
<P>
	A military judge is considering whether jurors should see more  
than 50 photos of the lift, which was sliced from its cable by an 
EA-6B Prowler jet flying near Cavalese, Italy, on Feb. 2. Twenty 
people inside were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Richard Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., the pilot,  
and Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury, N.Y., the navigator, 
face separate courts-martial next month at Camp Lejeune. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors argued Monday that jurors need to see the pictures  
of the wreckage and bodies to fully understand the case. Defense 
lawyers said the photos have little value as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are shocking. They are going to incite the jury,'' said  
Capt. John Shelburne, an attorney for Ashby. 
</P>
<P>
	Government lawyers said they are not planning to use autopsy  
photos or video of the victims being removed from the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no closeups or any attempt by the government to show  
the most gruesome photos we have available,'' said Maj. Stu Couch, 
one of the prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Col. Robert Nunley, the military judge, will rule on the  
pictures and other motions as hearings continue this week.

<HEADLINE> Man Charged in Nev. Horse Shootings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Police arrested a Reno construction worker  
Tuesday and planned to charge two Marines in California as well in 
the slaughter of 34 wild horses shot to death in Nevada with 
high-powered rifles. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Jon Merlino, 21 was arrested at his work site in  
neighboring Sparks on Tuesday, Washoe County Sheriff Richard 
Kirkland said. 
</P>
<P>
	Merlino was booked into the county jail on charges of grand  
larceny, grand theft and maiming, poisoning or killing another 
person's animal. 
</P>
<P>
	Arrest warrants on the same charges -- which carry combined  
maximum penalties in excess of 10 years in prison -- have been 
issued for the two Marines being held Tuesday night at U.S. Marine 
Corps bases in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Lance Cpl. Scott William Brendle, 22, was being held at Camp  
Pendleton, Calif., and Lance Cpl. Darien Thomas Brock, 21, was 
being held at Twentynine Palms east of Los Angeles, Storey County 
District Attorney Janet Hess said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sad but true,'' said Maj. Lenny Ryan of Camp Pendleton.  
</P>
<P>
	Both are members of the 1st Marine Division. Both were residents  
of the Reno area and home on holiday leave when the free-roaming 
mustangs were shot to death on Dec. 27, Storey County Sheriff Pat 
Whitten said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess said it was not clear if some form of extradition would be  
necessary, but that prosecutors intended to return the soldiers to 
Nevada for prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	Law officers have been investigating the case since the 34  
free-roaming mustangs were shot to death Dec. 27 about 5 miles east 
of the Reno-Sparks area. 
</P>
<P>
	The shootings rocked the local community. Animal protection  
groups helped raise a $35,000 reward for information leading to the 
arrest and conviction of those responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the horses were maimed and at least one was blasted with  
a chemical fire extinguisher on the rugged hillside about one mile 
south of Interstate 80.

<HEADLINE> Nat'l. Guard Helps Buffalo Dig Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- National Guard troops headed into the  
neighborhoods to help shovel snow today as the snow-weary city dug 
out from its latest storm. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest band of lake-effect snow dumped 5.4 inches on Buffalo  
on Monday, bringing the city's total since Jan. 1 to 41.6 inches. 
Buffalo Niagara International Airport, which closed from 3 to 6 
p.m., reported 4 inches in just one hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Anthony Masiello declared a state of emergency Monday and  
asked the state for help, and more than 30 troops from a National 
Guard engineer battalion were sent in with dump trucks and loaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, ice is about to bring relief from the snow. Lake  
Erie is on the verge of freezing over for the winter, and that 
means less moisture will evaporate to feed storms in the Buffalo 
area, just east of the lake. 
</P>
<P>
	``That should bring about a decrease in the heavy lake-effect  
snow that we've had,'' said Alan Blackburn, a meteorologist at the 
National Weather Service. He said Erie could freeze over by the end 
of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere around the Great Lakes, northern Indiana got up to 6.5  
inches of lake-effect snow overnight, boosting to the total on the 
ground at Plymouth to 24 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 10 inches of snow fell Monday in Michigan's lake-effect  
snow belts, and several inches around Detroit coated already 
slippery roads. 
</P>
<P>
	``The drive for me was OK, I'm a safe driver. But somebody flew  
past and did a great big spin,'' commuter Sharron Davis said today. 
``It's very slippery and you've got crazy fools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the cold and lake-effect snow in northern Ohio have cut into  
supplies of everything from road salt to winter clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sold a shovel with a broken handle and a bent blade to a guy  
on Sunday,'' said Larry Rudledge, manager of an Ace Hardware store 
in the Akron area. ``I gave him several bucks off and he was really 
happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Downriver from Buffalo, the spray created by Niagara Falls is  
coating rocks, cliffs, lamp posts and trees with ice. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is beautiful,'' said Ron Stoner, a retiree from Port  
Franks, Ontario, who visited the falls with his wife, Alida. ``It's 
beautiful in the summer, too, but it's two different worlds.''

<HEADLINE> Study Links Drug Use to Child Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Parental drug and alcohol abuse is largely  
responsible for a surge in child abuse and neglect, according to a 
report that urges more government spending to treat addicted 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse said in its  
report Monday that providing treatment for addicted parents would 
reduce the need to remove children from their families. 
</P>
<P>
	The study notes that the number of child welfare cases has more  
than doubled over 10 years, from 1.4 million in 1986 to more than 3 
million in 1997. The problem costs society billions of dollars each 
year, the authors say. 
</P>
<P>
	``Child abuse walks hand in hand with drug abuse and alcohol  
abuse,'' said Joseph Califano, the center's president and a former 
secretary of Health, Education and Welfare. ``If we're serious 
about doing something about child abuse and neglect, we better get 
serious about alcohol (and drug) abuse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report outlines the challenges of the child welfare system,  
particularly the large number of cases that workers and judges must 
handle and the lack of money available for drug and alcohol 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	It includes results from a survey of 915 professionals who work  
in the child welfare system. The survey found that 71.6 percent 
cited substance abuse as one of the top three causes of the rise in 
reported cases of child abuse and neglect, followed by better 
reporting and poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, just 5.8 percent of respondents said there was  
no wait for parents who need inpatient treatment; only 26 percent 
said there is no wait for outpatient treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Child Welfare League of America, which represents child  
welfare workers, agreed with the report's premise. Its research 
estimates that 40 percent to 80 percent of parents in the system 
have a drug or alcohol problem, depending on the community. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a really serious problem for us,'' said David Liederman,  
the group's executive director. ``We need targeted money to child 
welfare for drug treatment.''

<HEADLINE> Centers Face Blood Shortage Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- When Thomas Shields' blood bank begged him to  
roll up his sleeve for an emergency donation, the request hit close 
to home. 
</P>
<P>
	Shields, whose younger sister needs transfusions because her  
blood doesn't clot and whose grandmother has cancer-related anemia, 
had donated just once before. He made his second trip Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never really knew that they needed blood like that, or I  
would have donated earlier,'' said Shields, 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Blood banks across the country are pleading for donors after  
more than two weeks of harsh winter weather worsened the nation's 
usual post-holiday blood shortage. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't local or regional, this is a national crisis,''  
said Mark Lynch of the Central Blood Bank in Pittsburgh. ``People 
can become everyday heroes by donating a pint of blood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blood banks typically stockpile between three and four days'  
worth of blood, but about half of America's blood banks have less 
than a one-day supply, said Bob Ensinger of the National 
Association of Blood Banks. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pittsburgh, only 200 people have been donating blood daily  
during recent snow and ice storms, while the blood bank needs 700 
just to maintain adequate amounts. 
</P>
<P>
	To offset the effects of the shortage, the 40 hospitals that  
Central serves have agreed to postpone non-emergency surgery for a 
week, Lynch said. Types O-negative and O-positive are most in 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Blood banks have asked hospitals in Atlanta, Baltimore and  
Washington, D.C. to postpone elective surgery, Ensinger said. New 
York, Chicago, Detroit, Cincinnati and parts of Oregon were 
considering similar requests. 
</P>
<P>
	The harsh weather also has hampered efforts by well-supplied  
blood banks in the Midwest and Northeast to share their stockpiles 
with those that need blood. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are so many spots experiencing a shortage that we have  
not been able to receive any blood,'' said Donna Remington, 
spokeswoman for the Rhode Island Blood Center. ``Chicago was hit so 
bad they had three days with no collections. They're usually the 
first ones to help us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some blood banks, like North Central Blood Services in St. Paul,  
Minn., anticipated post-holiday slowdowns and scheduled special a 
blood drive shortly after New Year's Eve. 
</P>

	Others, like the Sacramento Blood Center, which serves 40  
hospitals in northern California, held theme events to attract 
donors. 
</P>
<P>
	``This week we have `type-O party.' For refreshments, we have  
Oreo cookies, Tootsie Rolls, anything with an `O' in it,'' said 
center spokeswoman Karen Gargiulo. ``It might sound silly, but that 
really does help.''

<HEADLINE> Stage Set for Impeachment Drama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House impeachment team readied opening  
arguments on Tuesday for President Clinton's historic Senate trial, 
while White House spokesman Joe Lockhart ridiculed their written 
filings as ``overblown rhetoric'' alleging sinister plots. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll leave the invective to Mr. Lockhart,'' retorted Rep.  
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the point man in the case against the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	With the trial to resume at 1 p.m. EST on Thursday, Lockhart  
also told reporters Clinton intends to stay busy on other matters 
while the proceedings unfold in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The president will deliver his State of the Union speech before  
a joint session of Congress on Jan. 19, for example, and travel to 
Buffalo, N.Y., and Montgomery County, Pa., outside Philadelphia, 
the following day to tout his domestic agenda. According to a 
tentative schedule released in the Senate, Clinton's attorneys 
would be presenting his defense both days. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton stands accused of perjury and obstruction of justice in  
the two articles of impeachment that cleared the House last year. 
His Senate trial is only the second such presidential proceeding in 
American history, 131 years after Andrew Johnson was acquitted in 
1868. 
</P>
<P>
	In a measure of concern for decorum, senators are being asked to  
observe unusual guidelines for the trial, including a request for 
all 100 to be in attendance ``at all times,'' and to restrict their 
reading materials to papers pertaining to the trial. There had been 
some confusion over what to call Chief Justice William Rehnquist. 
It was decided ``in accordance with precedent'' he would be 
addressed as Mr. Chief Justice. 
</P>
<P>
	House officials have until noon on Wednesday to turn over the  
written record in Clinton's impeachment case. Democratic sources, 
who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they would carefully 
scrutinize the submission to make sure it did not include material 
that is irrelevant to the two articles of impeachment passed by the 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential allies are prepared to object if they believe the  
House has included material that was not part of the two articles, 
these sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	They added that Abbe D. Lowell, the lead lawyer for House  
Judiciary Committee Democrats during proceedings in the House, had 
met with Senate Democratic aides recently and would be reviewing 
the material. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House worked against a Wednesday deadline for  
submission of its own trial brief. One outside adviser, speaking on 
condition of anonymity, said it was being drafted to suggest that 
House Republicans drew conclusions from the evidence that went far 
beyond prosecutor Kenneth Starr's own analysis of the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The adviser said the brief, which must still be approved by the  
president, is expected to highlight contradictory testimony and try 
to make a strong case that the key witnesses in the case -- Monica 
Lewinsky, Betty Currie and Vernon Jordan -- all made statements that 
support Clinton's denials of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, House prosecutors and Starr both concluded, from  
Ms. Lewinsky's testimony, that Mrs. Currie's retrieval of 
presidential gifts was an act of obstruction by the president. But 
White House lawyers will argue that Mrs. Currie testified Clinton 
never asked her to pick up the gifts and that Ms. Lewinsky 
testified Clinton never told her directly he was retrieving the 
gifts and that she just assumed the Oval Office secretary was 
acting on orders from the president. 
</P>
<P>
	The adviser said the White House brief also is unlikely to  
attack Ms. Lewinsky's credibility, instead dismissing 
contradictions between her testimony and the president's as 
differing recollections. 
</P>
<P>
	``The brief will argue Clinton admitted to an intimate  
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and that in any relationship there 
is room for differing recollections,'' the adviser said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican members of the House Judiciary Committee will present  
the case for Clinton's removal from office. Pending last minute 
changes, Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois will make brief opening 
comments, followed by Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, who 
will speak for about an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Republicans, including Reps. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas,  
James Rogan of California and Ed Bryant of Tennessee, will detail 
the evidence, after which Rep. Bill McCollum of Florida is expected 
to deliver a summary. 
</P>
<P>
	Reps. Bob Barr of Georgia, Chris Cannon of Utah, George Gekas of  
Pennsylvania, and Steve Chabot of Ohio will discuss the laws 
governing perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Reps. Charles Canady of Florida, Lindsey Graham of South  
Carolina and Steven Buyer of Indiana will address the issues of 
impeachable offenses, and either Hyde or Rogan, a former 
prosecutor, will make closing arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate schedule sets aside 24 hours for the House to make  
its case -- three eight-hour days, for example -- to be followed by 
24 hours for the White House to present its defense. Afterward, the 
Senate will have 16 hours to pose questions to the two sides. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a tentative calendar, that takes up the time through  
Saturday, Jan. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	At that point, the White House or a Senate Democratic ally is  
expected to seek dismissal of the charges, and the House is 
expected to counter with a request for witnesses, with no firm 
expectation of how long that takes. 
</P>
<P>
	Few, if any, senators are predicting that Clinton will be  
stripped of the presidency -- a step that requires a two-thirds 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	And Lockhart was biting during the day in comments made about a  
lengthy trial brief submitted by House prosecutors on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It reads like a cheap mystery,'' he said at one point.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is at times a hallmark of what's a weak factual and  
constitutional case that the allegations continue to shift, and 
that the rhetoric continues to be overblown,'' he said in a second 
appearance before reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, he added, ``I mean, I think there is overblown rhetoric  
in there about sinister plots, and I think that it detracts from 
the argument they are trying to make,'' he added.

<HEADLINE> Dome Too Noisy for Vikes' Opponents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Playoff football in Minnesota used to mean  
snow and bitter cold, a distinct home-field advantage that helped 
the Vikings to four Super Bowls in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the temperature never strays too far from 68 degrees  
whenever the Vikings play at home, but they've still got a big edge 
in what owner Red McCombs calls ``the noisiest stadium in the 
NFL.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the Vikings aren't apologizing for the manmade advantage  
they've had at the Metrodome this season, something that has helped 
them within one victory of their first Super Bowl in 22 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who cares if it's fair or not. We earned it,'' running back  
Leroy Hoard said. ``Everybody has the same opportunity that we had 
to get home-field advantage. We got it. It's got to be good for 
something -- that noise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That noise is something the Atlanta Falcons will have to deal  
with in Sunday's NFC championship game, which the Arizona Cardinals 
were unable to do in the divisional round last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The racket helped rattle Arizona quarterback Jake Plummer into  
three turnovers that led to 17 points for the Vikings in their 
41-21 victory. The decibel level wasn't the difference for 
Minnesota -- its offense was -- but it certainly helped. 
</P>
<P>
	``(The) crowd was a big part of it,'' Atlanta coach Dan Reeves  
said. ``(It) gave Arizona a lot of problems early in the game. 
Those are the type things we've got to be ready to deal with. You 
can't change them. They're going to be there. We've got to deal 
with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At one point just before kickoff Sunday, Cardinals tackle Lomas  
Brown and some teammates tried to communicate by screaming while 
standing next to each other. They couldn't hear. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither could Hoard and Robert Smith, who were side by side on  
the Vikings' side of the field. Plummer said there were times 
during the game when he couldn't hear offensive coordinator Marc 
Trestman, who was speaking directly into his helmet from the 
coaches' booth via microphone. 
</P>
<P>
	The most annoying, and some say most disrupting, part of the  
dome noise is the stuff roaring through the speaker system. The 
Vikings blast heavy metal music and other canned noise into the 
arena to help whip the fans into a frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers complained loudly about the piped-in noise after  
their 28-14 loss at the dome Nov. 22. Their biggest beef was about 
on-field speakers the Vikings say they use to channel the music to 
the cheerleaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Vikings vice president of business operations Rand Gottlieb  
contends the team stays within league rules for stadium noise, 
including turning off all artificial sound when the opposing 
offense breaks the huddle. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's when the fans take over, with 64,000 of them  
screaming as the quarterback slips behind center. That's helped the 
Vikings (16-1) go 9-0 at home this season, winning by an average 
score of 36-13. They are 11-point favorites against the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the loudspeakers and crowd noise, our communication was  
messed up all day,'' Arizona center Aaron Graham said. ``It was 
almost non-existent. It forced us into trying all sorts of things 
we haven't tried before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's the dome-field advantage, something the Minnesota Twins  
used to win World Series titles in 1987 and 1991. No dome team ever 
has made it to the Super Bowl, but Sunday's matchup guarantees one 
finally will. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to their enthusiastic fans, the Falcons (15-2) enjoyed a  
similar edge against San Francisco last weekend at the Georgia 
Dome. Now they'll feel what it's like to be in someone else's 
raucous dome, and the Vikings aren't concerned with what anyone 
thinks of that advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want me to feel sorry for it? No, I don't,'' Hoard said.  
``We bust our butts all year. We won 15 games (in the regular 
season). It's got to count for something -- the home-field 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether we play indoors or outdoors, that's what all the other  
teams got to think of. `Oh, man. We don't want them to get 
home-field advantage. They play indoors.'''

<HEADLINE> Jewish Settlers Hail US Millionaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Jewish settlers Tuesday cheered a Florida  
millionaire whose donations have helped them buy homes from Arabs 
and expand a Jewish presence in the Muslim Quarter of Jerusalem's 
Old City. 
</P>
<P>
	The financier, Irving Moskowitz, basked in the hero's welcome.  
But some Israelis expressed fear that his campaign to move more 
Jews into disputed areas captured by Israel and claimed by the 
Palestinians will only lead to violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts to build on a four-acre plot of land Moskowitz owns  
outside the Old City walls have sparked violent riots between 
Palestinian residents and Israeli troops. Other Moskowitz-funded 
causes include the extreme right-wing Ateret Cohanim group, whose 
presence in the predominately Arab section of the Old City has led 
to friction and sporadic violence between Jews and Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
	Moskowitz, who visits Israel regularly, is currently traveling  
with 14 American Jews. The delegation is meeting with right-wing 
candidates running for prime minister in upcoming elections and 
touring Jewish settlements. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the group visited sites in the Old City run by the  
Ateret Cohanim seminary and then went to the tensely divided West 
Bank city of Hebron. 
</P>
<P>
	A small man, Moskowitz, who made his money from bingo parlors,  
was flanked by a broad-shouldered body guard as he toured both 
areas, often the sites of violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing on the rooftop of a dilapidated building Ateret Cohanim  
hopes to renovate and restore as a synagogue, Moskowitz spoke of 
his work to increase the number of Jews in east Jerusalem with 
religious fervor. 
</P>
<P>
	Tal Klein, a shaggy haired 19-year-old who studies at Ateret  
Cohanim in the Muslim Quarter, said Moskowitz's contributions are 
``protecting and strengthening our lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Knesset lawmaker Yossi Sarid of the left-wing Meretz party  
argued that Moskowitz was doing just the opposite by helping to 
alter the demographics in one of the most sensitive areas of the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Moskowitz phenomenon is both frightening and disgusting.  
The very thought that a man who makes his money from betting 
parlors is also gambling with our fate fills me with 
apprehension,'' Sarid said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hebron, Moskowitz was greeted by music and dance. He danced  
with children from the settlement, sang songs extolling Jerusalem 
and prayed in the Tomb of the Patriarchs, a site holy to Jews and 
Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are people who love us and help us, they are real lovers  
of Israel,'' said Baruch Marzel, a leader among militant Hebron 
settlers. ``They live a quiet life in the United States but ... 
they can't sleep at night if they don't give money to Hebron.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States considers the building of Jewish settlements  
to be an impediment to a permanent peace between Palestinians and 
Jews. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu supports 
settlements. 
</P>
<P>
	After touring the Old City, Moskowitz, who contributed to  
Netanyahu's successful 1996 campaign, met for an hour with the 
premier, who is facing re-election. 
</P>
<P>
	Ignoring all political questions, Moskowitz said curtly that he  
was not seeking to support a specific candidate. Individual members 
of his entourage, however, emerged from their meeting with 
Netanyahu solidly behind the hard-line premier. 
</P>
<P>
	Dov Hikind, a New York state assemblyman from Brooklyn traveling  
with Moskowitz, said he had no doubt that Netanyahu was the right 
man to rally behind.

<HEADLINE> Combs Said Responsible for Stampede </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sean ``Puffy'' Combs and rapper Heavy D are 50  
percent responsible for a stampede at a party that left nine people 
dead in 1991, a state judge has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	The City College of New York, where the party was held in a  
gymnasium, bears the rest of the responsibility, Court of Claims 
Judge Louis Benza ruled Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The people were killed when fans rushed a celebrity basketball  
game and party sponsored by Combs. One of those injured, Nicole 
Levy, 25, filed the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Benza said school officials knew the event was oversold and  
failed to provide adequate supervision of the crowd in part by 
abandoning security responsibility to Combs. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said Combs' security people closed the only door to  
the gym and propped a table behind it to make sure only those who 
had paid could enter -- despite the tragedy that unfolded. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their pounding and their cries for help did not dissuade  
Combs' people from closing the door, precipitating the eventual 
deaths and injuries that occurred,'' Benza wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for Combs, a producer and rapper, said the judge only  
has jurisdiction over public agencies and institutions, so the 
ruling has no practical effect on Combs and Heavy D, whose real 
name is Dwight Myers. 
</P>
<P>
	Levy's lawyer, Peter De Filippis, said he is trying to settle  
the case. Combs' attorney said his client had no comment on 
settlement talks.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Fall: Dow Ends 145.21 Lower / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply Tuesday as investors,  
cautious in advance of big earnings reports, collected some of the 
profits they've earned in the new year's bull market. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology sector that has soared recently was hardest hit.  
At the close of trading on Wall Street, the technology-heavy Nasdaq 
index was sharply down 63.84 at 2,320.75, while the Dow Jones 
industrial average was down 145.21 at 9,474.68. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the enormous run we've had, with the frenetic movement  
in some of thes technology and Internet stocks, I consider this 
99.999 percent profit-taking,'' said Charles Pradilla, chief 
investment strategist at Cowen &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very normal pullback,'' he added. ``A lot of portfolio  
managers think maybe the market is ahead of itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investors decided to take profits on many of those stocks that  
have been flying high in 1999. Among the biggest losers were 
Amazon.com, which fell 21 1/4 to 163 3/8, and Lycos, down 26 1/2 at 104 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	``These stocks have had such a tremendous run that investors are  
taking the chance to reassess,'' said Ronald Hill, a partner with 
Brown Brothers Harriman &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	During the day, Yahoo! and Intel were weighed down by concerns  
that their fourth-quarter earnings expectations had been too high. 
Yahoo! fell 19 15/16 to 395 11/16. Intel was down 4 3/16 at 135 
9/16. 
</P>
<P>
	But after the close of trading, both companies reported profits  
that beat analyst forecasts. Intel reported an 18 percent rise in 
fourth-quarter profit, boosted by sales of microprocessors used in 
high-end personal computers, while Yahoo! reported fourth-quarter 
revenues had tripled from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue chips lost ground for a second day. The Dow, which had  
gained 5 percent last week, dropped 23.43 on Monday. On Tuesday, 
Alcoa was down 2 15/16 at 85 1/4 after it was downgraded by Morgan 
Stanley. 
</P>
<P>
	Some traders believed that investors were concerned about the  
dollar, which reached a 28-month low against the yen on Monday but 
rallied Tuesday on reports of Bank of Japan intervention. A strong 
dollar has helped to keep inflation stable in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Broad-market indexes were down. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell  
24.37 to 1,239.51. Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 
12-to-5 margin on the New York Stock Exchange, with 2,186 up, 892 
down and 470 unchanged. NYSE volume totaled 789.44 million shares 
as of 4 p.m., vs. 810.69 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 9.45 to 594.59, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 7.67 to 699.65. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 5.78 to 427.35.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average was down 0.06 percent.  
Germany's DAX index fell 1.34 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 
0.84 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 2.41 percent.

	``Her experience and expertise will play a pivotal role in  
returning Service Merchandise to profitability,'' said chairman 
Raymond Zimmerman. 
</P>
<P>
	Company profits and stock prices continued to tumble last year,  
despite a massive restructuring that included narrowing its product 
offerings to jewelry, housewares and furnishings and shifting from 
warehouse distribution to off-the-shelf sales. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Alfalfa Sprouts, Salmonella Linked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Alfalfa sprouts, the quintessential health food  
used as garnish on everything from salads to hamburgers, sickened 
an estimated 20,000 people in the United States in two outbreaks in 
1995, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers ``should consider this danger when deciding whether to  
eat alfalfa sprouts,'' the researchers, led by Dr. Chris Van 
Beneden, an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, reported in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Although new methods to prevent salmonella poisoning are being  
tried, the researchers said they may not be adequate. 
</P>
<P>
	Salmonella is a strain of bacteria found in animal feces. It  
generally causes nausea but can be fatal in older people, infants 
and those with weak immune systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Tainted alfalfa sprout seeds caused a 1995 outbreak in the  
Pacific Northwest and another one that same year from Georgia to 
Vermont, the researchers said. They said the same seeds sickened an 
undetermined number of people in Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
	Although only about 700 salmonella cases were reported, the  
researchers estimated more than 20,000 people in the United States 
alone were sickened since only a fraction of cases are usually 
reported. No one died. 
</P>
<P>
	The seeds were traced to a seed broker in the Netherlands. The  
researchers suspect the seeds were tainted either in the field by 
animal feces or wastewater, or by an infected worker at a 
seed-packaging plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfalfa sprouts were first implicated as a source of illness in  
1973, but their image as a health food may have spared them the 
scrutiny given more widely recognized sources for salmonella like 
meat, chicken and eggs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because it was a health food, it wasn't as highly  
suspicious,'' Van Beneden said. Also, sprouts were not as popular 
25 years ago as they are now. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of the International Sprout Growers Association  
acknowledged the salmonella scare has devastated the industry but 
said the findings predate new methods for safeguarding seeds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The old techniques just didn't work, but the new ones will,''  
said association president Nancy Snider, who owns a sprout farm in 
Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	The outbreaks forced a number of growers out of business. Since  
then, Snider said, some growers have begun using a chlorination 
process approved last fall by the Environmental Protection Agency 
to decontaminate seeds.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Punishes 3 Russia Institutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States imposed penalties on a  
Moscow university and two other Russian institutions Tuesday, 
accusing Russia of failing to stop its scientists from helping Iran 
and other states develop nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	National Security adviser Sandy Berger, in announcing the  
economic sanctions, said Russia needs an export control system that 
is ``designed to work and does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Only Russia can police its own borders, factories and  
technology industries,'' he said while asserting the Clinton 
administration's authority to act against foreign companies or 
agencies that ``violate international nonproliferation standards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The penalties are against Mendeleyev Chemical Technical  
University in Moscow, the Moscow Aviation Institute, and the 
Scientific Research and Design Institute of Power and Technology. 
The first two receive Russian government funding, according to 
administration sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The sanctions will ban all U.S. exports to the companies, all  
imports to the United States and any U.S. Government assistance or 
procurement contracts with the companies. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, the administration penalized seven other enterprises,  
some of which had ties to the Russian government. They were accused 
of selling sensitive weapons technology to Iran, Libya and North 
Korea. None of those sanctions has been lifted. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger disclosed the penalties in remarks to the annual Carnegie  
International Nonproliferation Conference. The forum was chosen 
because attendees work closely with Russia's nuclear community and 
would carry U.S. concern to their counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, also speaking at the  
conference, said the Russian institutions' actions were designed to 
``directly support Iranian efforts to develop nuclear weapons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. message is that commerce with Iran in weaponry will be  
costly and ``is a threat to the United States, to Russia and to the 
world,'' said Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials declined to discuss additional details of the  
allegations against the Russian enterprises. A White House 
statement said the actions ``complement Russian government efforts 
to enforce its laws and international commitments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate response from Moscow. Offices of the  
affected institutions were closed for the day when Berger made the 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart disputed a suggestion that  
the United States' gripe is really with the Kremlin and not with 
the individual entities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to work with the Russian government. They have  
taken some steps. We believe they need to take further steps,'' he 
said. ``These companies, we believe, were taking steps that made it 
impossible for the United States government to work with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton in July signed an executive order that allows  
him to impose penalties when there has been an attempt to transfer 
technology as well as when transfers have actually occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger, in a speech at the annual Carnegie International  
Nonproliferation Conference, also promised a redoubling of U.S. 
efforts worldwide to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction 
and an all-out push to get Senate ratification of the Comprehensive 
Test Ban Treaty, which would ban all nuclear explosive testing. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty signed by 151 nations includes a pledge against all  
testing of nuclear devices and sets up a global system of sensors 
to monitor compliance. Berger said it cannot enter into force until 
the United States and other key nations ratify it. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we fail to ratify, we will undercut our own efforts to curb  
further nuclear arms development, particularly in South Asia,'' he 
said, noting that India and Pakistan each have announced an 
intention to adhere to the treaty by September. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger cited polls showing that 75 percent to 80 percent of  
Americans support the treaty but acknowledged it faces an uphill 
battle. ``We have formidable opponents in the Senate,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger said it was needed to bolster U.S. efforts to get India  
and Pakistan to back away from nuclear testing.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Says It Will Honor Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Trying to calm investors,  
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said Tuesday that Brazil will 
honor all its foreign debt obligations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market can rest assured,'' Cardoso said. ``We know what we  
will do, we know what we are doing, we will pay all our debts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His comments, however, failed to stem losses on the Sao Paulo  
Stock Exchange. The market was still reeling after the governor of 
Minas Gerais, Itamar Franco, last week declared a moratorium on the 
state's federal debt payments because its coffers were empty. 
</P>
<P>
	The government responded Monday by blocking a $9.75 million  
federal subsidy allotment. 
</P>
<P>
	Franco's move alarmed investors who were already worried about  
Brazil's $65 billion budget deficit, raising concerns that other 
states would follow the example set by Brazil's third wealthiest 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sao Paulo exchange -- Latin America's largest -- was down 7.5  
percent at mid-session on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardoso insisted that states must put their own financial houses  
in order. He said that excess payroll expenditures and the social 
security system weigh most heavily on state accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	While criticized by most other state governors, Franco received  
the support of the government of the southern state of Rio Grande 
do Sul, which has warned that its debt is ``unpayable.''

<HEADLINE> New Implant To Correct Eyesight OKd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- Tiny, transparent rings implanted onto the  
cornea may help correct mild to moderate nearsightedness that 
plagues 20 million Americans, offering an alternative to popular 
but irreversible laser surgery and costing about the same. 
</P>
<P>
	The key to KeraVision Inc.'s Intacs implants: If the patient  
doesn't like the result or suffers a side effect such as glare, 
doctors can remove the ring with a good chance of returning the 
patient's eye to its condition before surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who know about the ring can't be talked into having the  
laser'' surgery, said Dr. David Schanzlin of the University of 
California, San Diego, who led KeraVision's clinical trials. ``It's 
the idea that if this doesn't work, you can take it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advisers to the Food and Drug Administration voted unanimously  
Tuesday that the implants -- two crescents about the thickness of a 
contact lens that form a ring around the cornea's edge -- should be 
sold. 
</P>
<P>
	But the panel stressed that Intacs can cause side effects.  
Removing the implant will often, but not always, relieve the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's largely reversible,'' said panel chairman Dr. James  
McCulley of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. 
But he stressed, ``It's not an absolute certainty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA is not bound by its advisers' recommendations but  
typically follows them. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearsightedness occurs when a person's cornea, the membrane  
covering the front of the eye, is too steeply curved. Flattening 
the cornea can help correct nearsightedness. Hundreds of thousands 
of Americans have sought radial keratotomy, where surgeons slice 
the cornea with a knife, or laser surgery that shaves the cornea to 
do that. 
</P>
<P>
	But those surgeries can be risky, sometimes causing problems  
with night vision, glare, seeing halos or blurry vision. Patients 
occasionally cannot see as well after surgery as before. Thus, most 
patients who choose these operations do so only because they are 
severely nearsighted. 
</P>
<P>
	With Intacs, the implants' slight weight flattens the cornea  
without the permanence of cutting the tissue. 
</P>
<P>
	KeraVision hopes to attract some 20 million mildly to moderately  
nearsighted Americans -- those whose vision ranges from 20/40, where 
it's OK to drive but a movie is blurry without glasses, to 20/200, 
where patients can barely see the big ``E'' atop eye charts. 
</P>
<P>
	In a yearlong study of the surgery on 449 eyes, 97 percent could  
see 20/40 or better without glasses or contact lenses after the 
implant. About 74 percent had 20/20 or better vision without 
glasses, and 53 percent could see 20/16 -- the sharper vision 
Schanzlin said is required of combat pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	Most patients achieved good vision a day after surgery.  
</P>
<P>
	Intacs isn't risk-free: Some 7 percent to 17 percent of patients  
suffered side effects similar to laser surgery, including glare, 
halos and problems with night vision. 
</P>
<P>
	About 5 percent of patients had their implants removed. That  
included 14 patients dissatisfied with their vision correction and 
16 who had visual side effects. Removing the implant corrected over 
80 percent of those side effects, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	The operation itself is ``very easy to master,'' said Schanzlin.  
</P>
<P>
	Patients get anesthetic eye drops to numb the eye, but remain  
awake. The doctor clamps the eyelid open, cuts a tiny pocket into 
the cornea and uses a special device to slip the crescents onto the 
cornea. The implants are made of the same material as the lenses 
implanted into cataract surgery patients. A single stitch closes 
the wound. 
</P>
<P>
	It takes about 15 minutes. About 15 percent of patients report  
some pain; as with any surgery, infection also is a risk. 
</P>
<P>
	The procedure will cost about $2,200 an eye, about the same as  
laser surgery -- and includes removal if the patient is not 
satisfied, KeraVision said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA is reviewing three sizes of Intacs. The company is  
testing thicker versions for more severely nearsighted patients.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Hoops Coach Ends Lockout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Calif. (AP) -- The NBA lockout is over. In this case,  
NBA stood for No Bad Attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
	Richmond High School coach Ken Carter kept his team out of the  
gym for a week in order to push them to improve their academics. 
The lockout ended just in time for Tuesday night's league opener 
against St. Elizabeth's of Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	``The young men met the challenge, turned in homework and  
attended class,'' Carter said Monday after the first practice in a 
week. ``This is the only lockout where everybody won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carter, whose varsity team is 13-0, closed the gym and banned  
all basketball-related activities, including rallies, because 15 of 
the basketball program's 45 players weren't living up to the 
classroom achievements they promised to fulfill in contracts they 
signed in September. 
</P>
<P>
	All team members had the 2.0 GPA required to play, but some fell  
below the 2.3 they agreed to maintain in the contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	The student athletes gathered in the library Monday when school  
officials announced the end of the lockout. They roared approval 
and gave each other high fives. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first, I didn't understand why my dad did this,'' said  
Carter's son, Damien, who plays on the team and has a 3.7 grade 
point average. ``Then I finally realized what he was trying to do; 
he is showing love for the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carter locked the gym after teachers complained some players  
were ignoring homework and skipping school. 
</P>
<P>
	After a week of tutoring, Carter and athletic director Roy  
Rogers reviewed the latest round of progress reports. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our main goal here was to teach the boys that education,  
unlike athletics, is a thing that can't be taken from you,'' Rogers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The team missed one game, last Friday's non-league encounter.  
Carter hopes to reschedule the contest later in the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Junior guard Chris Dixon said Carter's decision was the right  
one. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are always consequences,'' Dixon said. ``Everyone needs  
to handle their business in the classroom like they do on the 
court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lockout might not have had much of an effect, according to  
economics teacher Bill Erkkila. He has a varsity player in his 
class who has turned in only eight of 28 assignments. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Carter's idea was a good one, but it was too late to  
change much,'' the teacher said.

<HEADLINE> Court Halts Nebraska Execution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- The Nebraska Supreme Court on Tuesday  
stayed the execution of a man who stabbed two women to death in a 
Quaker meeting house. Quaker leaders nationwide had pleaded for the 
man's life to be spared. 
</P>
<P>
	Randolph Reeves, 42, an American Indian adopted by a white  
Quaker family, was scheduled to die in the electric chair Thursday 
morning. The court said it issued the stay to hear an appeal filed 
Monday by Reeves' attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves was sentenced to death in 1981 for stabbing Janet Mesner  
and Victoria Lamm inside a Quaker meeting house. Reeves, who was 
drunk and had taken drugs on the night of the murders, has said he 
does not remember the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Quakers are fundamentally opposed to the death penalty, and  
clergy joined the victims' families Monday to ask the Nebraska 
Board of Pardons to grant Reeves a last-minute clemency hearing. 
The board rejected the emotional pleas. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal claims executing Reeves would violate a new  
equal-protection clause in the state Constitution, approved by 
voters in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Paula Hutchinson, Reeves' attorney, claims in the appeal that  
Indians and blacks combined make up 4 percent of Nebraska's 
population but have comprised six of the 20 death row inmates -- 30 
percent -- and two of the three inmates executed since Nebraska 
resumed the death penalty in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Ford To Be Hired As Clippers Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- After nearly nine months, the Los Angeles  
Clippers are finally getting a head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Ford, fired as coach of the Milwaukee Bucks last August,  
was to be hired in that capacity by the Clippers today, The 
Associated Press learned late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clippers have been without a coach since Bill Fitch was  
fired last April 20, two days after the team completed a 17-65 
season that was third-worst in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Fitch coached the Clippers to a 99-229 record in four seasons.  
He has a career record of 944-1,106. 
</P>
<P>
	Clippers spokesperson Jill Wiggins refused comment except to say  
the team would hold a press conference today at 3 p.m. PST in the 
Los Angeles Convention Center to make what she called a major 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford, who turned 50 on Monday, will be the Clippers' seventh  
coach this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford coached the Boston Celtics from 1990-95 and the Bucks for  
the last two seasons. He was fired Aug. 26 with one year remaining 
on his contract after the Bucks went 36-46 and failed to make the 
playoffs for the second straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bucks were 33-49 in Ford's first year as their coach. In  
seven years as an NBA head coach, Ford's teams have a 291-283 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford played in the NBA for 10 seasons, six with the Detroit  
Pistons and four with the Celtics. He was an assistant with the 
Celtics for seven years before his five-year tenure as coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Fitch was Ford's coach in his final three years as a player in  
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clippers announced that Ford, former Sacramento Kings coach  
Eddie Jordan and Jim Brewer were the three finalists for the job. 
Brewer was an assistant under Fitch for four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``You hear so many different rumors,'' Clippers swing man Eric  
Piatkowski said after the team worked out Tuesday at Veterans 
Memorial Park in suburban Carson. ``I think each player has his own 
preference. We'll just have to wait and see. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can't do a whole lot right now, anyway,'' Piatkowski  
said, referring to the fact that coaches can't attend team workouts 
until the start of training camp next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Piatkowski was one of seven Clippers under contract who spent  
about two hours working out Tuesday -- the team's second voluntary 
practice since an agreement was reached last week between the 
owners and players to end the lockout. The others were Lorenzen 
Wright, Keith Closs, James Robinson, Charles Smith, Stojko 
Vrankovic and Pooh Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, unsigned free agents Darrick Martin, who hopes to  
re-sign with the Clippers, and Brent Barry, traded by the Clippers 
to Miami last winter, also participated. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said the sooner the Clippers have a coach, the  
better. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of young guys,'' Richardson said. ``I don't know  
coach Ford. I know he played in the league, he's a person who fell 
victim to injuries (on the Bucks).''

<HEADLINE>  Olympic Official Fights Allegations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- African Olympic official Jean-Claude Ganga will  
fight any attempts to oust him from the IOC in connection with the 
Salt Lake City bribery scandal, The Associated Press has learned. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not going to lay down and die,'' a knowledgeable Olympic  
source said Tuesday, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``He will 
only go if there is absolutely no other way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga, of the Republic of Congo, is among the IOC members under  
investigation for accepting cash, scholarships, medical treatment, 
gifts and other favors during Salt Lake's winning bid for the 2002 
Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	At least eight International Olympic Committee members are  
believed to have been implicated. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Pound, the IOC vice president heading the inquiry, sent  
letters this week to each member suspected of impropriety and 
demanding an explanation. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee will meet in Lausanne, Switzerland, Jan. 23-24 to  
announce its findings and take action against members found to have 
acted improperly. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC leaders say any members found guilty of corruption will be  
expelled or asked to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	The source said Ganga, who is also head of the Association of  
National Olympic Committees of Africa, expected to receive a letter 
from the investigative panel. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knows it is serious but he will fight,'' the source said.  
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with French radio last weekend, Ganga denied any  
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will not become rich because I voted for Salt Lake City,''  
he said. ``That is why I am so serene.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Repeated attempts by the AP to reach Ganga at his residences in  
Paris and Brazzaville, Congo, and ANOCA headquarters in Yaounde, 
Cameroon, were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP reported last week that Ganga made a $60,000 profit on a  
Utah land deal arranged through the Salt Lake bid committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Welch, the former bid chief, said he arranged for free  
medical care for Ganga and his mother and paid $50,000 in cash to 
Ganga to help feed hungry children in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	In the radio interview, Ganga described the real-estate deal as  
``normal'' and said it ``happened a long time after the vote. 
Therefore, it couldn't have influenced me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are certainly other larger and more important issues  
than these little questions about a real estate contract,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga also said he offered to pay for his medical treatment in  
Salt Lake but the costs were covered under an arrangement between 
the hospital and the bid committee. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not comment on the cash payments he received. Welch said  
Ganga sought the money to help children in the Republic of Congo, 
which has been ravaged by civil strife.

	Dick Pound, the IOC vice president heading the inquiry, sent  
letters this week to each member suspected of impropriety and 
demanding an explanation. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee will meet in Lausanne, Switzerland, Jan. 23-24 to  
announce its findings and take action against members found to have 
acted improperly. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC leaders say any members found guilty of corruption will be  
expelled or asked to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	The source said Ganga, who is also head of the Association of  
National Olympic Committees of Africa, expected to receive a letter 
from the investigative panel. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knows it is serious but he will fight,'' the source said.  
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with French radio last weekend, Ganga denied any  
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will not become rich because I voted for Salt Lake City,''  
he said. ``That is why I am so serene.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Repeated attempts by the AP to reach Ganga at his residences in  
Paris and Brazzaville, Congo, and ANOCA headquarters in Yaounde, 
Cameroon, were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP reported last week that Ganga made a $60,000 profit on a  
Utah land deal arranged through the Salt Lake bid committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Welch, the former bid chief, said he arranged for free  
medical care for Ganga and his mother and paid $50,000 in cash to 
Ganga to help feed hungry children in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	In the radio interview, Ganga described the real-estate deal as  
``normal'' and said it ``happened a long time after the vote. 
Therefore, it couldn't have influenced me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are certainly other larger and more important issues  
than these little questions about a real estate contract,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga also said he offered to pay for his medical treatment in  
Salt Lake but the costs were covered under an arrangement between 
the hospital and the bid committee. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not comment on the cash payments he received. Welch said  
Ganga sought the money to help children in the Republic of Congo, 
which has been ravaged by civil strife.

<HEADLINE> Laggard Funds May Not Be Losers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- While many people chase furiously after ``hot''  
stock mutual funds, one investment adviser recommends paying some 
attention to cold ones. 
</P>
<P>
	It's only human nature for investors to gravitate to the funds  
that lead the performance rankings in any given year, wanting to 
put their money in what looks like proven success stories. The 
problem is that what worked so well in yesterday's financial 
climate doesn't always get such good results in tomorrow's. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being contrarians, we suggest the opposite strategy --  
investing in some of the coldest funds of the past year,'' says 
George Putnam III, editor the Boston-based advisory The Turnaround 
Letter. 
</P>
<P>
	``While our research is less than scientific, we have observed  
over the years that many of the best fund managers occasionally get 
a cold hand for a short time. When these guys revert to their 
winning form, their investors do very well. 
</P>
<P>
	``In many cases, the managers were ultimately correct in their  
strategy, but they were temporarily punished for being too early.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If this idea catches your fancy, be careful with it -- it  
requires quite a bit of thoughtful consideration before you try to 
act on it. For one thing, mutual funds never sell for below-market 
bargain prices, no matter how far they fall from favor. 
</P>
<P>
	A down-and-out stock or closed-end fund may become attractive  
simply because its price, which is set by supply and demand in the 
marketplace, exaggerates whatever problems exist. But an open-end 
fund's shares are always bought and sold at a price based on the 
net asset value of its portfolio, so there cannot be any hidden 
assets for an investor to exploit (though there may be in the 
stocks the fund owns). 
</P>
<P>
	``It is very important not just to pick the worst performers in  
a given year,'' says Putnam. ``You must look at the fund's 
long-term record to make sure that the manager just had an off year 
and is not a chronic underperformer. It seems that some funds never 
get it right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Putnam cites the legendary example of the worst fund family  
ever, the Steadman Funds. Another case in point -- the American 
Heritage Fund, which fell 61 percent in 1998 to rank as the biggest 
loser among all domestic stock funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody should consider this fund before looking at its five-year  
record (down 71 percent), its sky-high expenses and its 
nondiversified portfolio, all of which raise glaring red flags. 
</P>
<P>
	A more intriguing case involves the Vanguard Windsor Fund, an  
$18 billion behemoth that had an excellent long-term record under 
superstar manager John Neff. Neff retired three years ago and 
turned the reins over to his longtime associate, Charles Freeman. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, the fund limped to a 0.81 percent return, trailing the  
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index funds by more than 27 percentage 
points. Freeman staked a lot of the fund's money on energy and 
industrial stocks that went nowhere while other issues that didn't 
meet his value criteria, such as technology stocks, soared. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not surprisingly, the fund, which was forced to close 10 years  
ago due to its enormous popularity, has lost some jittery 
shareholders lately,'' says Amy Granzin, an analyst at the 
Morningstar Mutual Funds research service. ``Those who stick around 
may not see an end to the misery soon, either. Freeman is committed 
to a long-term strategy and plans to hold his stocks ... until they 
make good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But if you have a patient temperament, there is a worthy  
argument for staying with a prominent fund like Vanguard Windsor, 
especially if you have accumulated big gains in the fund and would 
have to pay a hefty tax bill if you cashed out. 
</P>
<P>
	No major fund firm likes to let a highly visible member of its  
family keep languishing indefinitely. In Windsor's annual report, 
Freeman and Vanguard's top managers all frankly acknowledge the 
problem, and say they expect things to get much better in a market 
climate less hostile to value stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman got terrific results at Windsor in his first year, in  
1996, Ms. Granzin notes. While Neff is gone, adds Putnam, ``the 
rest of the analytical and management team that built the track 
record is still in place.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Travels As Trial Proceeds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is undertaking a busy travel  
schedule during the Senate impeachment trial, likely taking him out 
of Washington for two weeks or more as lawmakers decide his fate. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House also is facing pressure to increase reporters'  
access to Clinton. But press secretary Joe Lockhart said Tuesday 
that it would be ``unproductive'' for Clinton to hold a news 
conference or answer reporters' questions because they would focus 
on his impeachment and Senate trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart, in a sometimes contentious briefing with reporters,  
said Clinton's lawyers have not advised him to avoid questions from 
the press and that he is free to talk. However, the press spokesman 
said: ``He has said to you on numerous occasions that he doesn't 
know anything more productive he can say on this subject. He'd love 
to talk about some other subjects, some important things he's 
doing. '' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's last news conference was Dec. 13 in Israel, focusing  
on whether he would resign if impeached and whether he would ever 
admit he had committed perjury. Rather than subject Clinton to 
those types of questions again, the White House decided not to hold 
the traditional news conference with a visiting head of state when 
Argentine President Carlos Menem came to Washington Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House strategy during the impeachment and trial is  
intended to project an image of presidential leadership, showing 
that Clinton is absorbed with the nation's business and not 
preoccupied with his own problems. It is a tactic that has helped 
keep his poll ratings exceptionally high throughout the Monica 
Lewinsky controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	After announcing a series of policy and budget initiatives this  
week, Clinton will head to New York on Thursday for a Friday 
conference sponsored by Jesse Jackson to expand minority hiring on 
Wall Street and increase corporate investment in poor 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart announced Clinton also will travel to Buffalo, N.Y.,  
and Montgomery County, Pa., on the day after his Jan. 19 State of 
the Union address ``to amplify on the themes and policies of that 
speech.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House also has announced plans for a Jan. 26 trip to  
St. Louis for Clinton to greet Pope John Paul II, and a six-day 
visit to Latin America beginning Feb. 10. He also has tentative 
plans for at least two other day trips from Washington and a three- 
or four-day West Coast swing toward the end of February. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials deny all that activity is an attempt to  
blot out the impeachment trial, saying Clinton is only trying to do 
what the American people want. 
</P>
<P>
	``They think people in Washington should spend less time  
thinking about themselves and more time about the people out 
there,'' said communications director Ann Lewis. ``This is the 
president doing the job he was hired and trusted by the American 
people to do, and doing it with every bit as much energy, attention 
and enthusiasm as we have here.''

<HEADLINE> Utilities Call Y2K a Minimal Impact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Electric power companies are resolving  
potential computer problems at the end of the year when 1999 
becomes 2000, an industry report concludes. 
</P>
<P>
	The review by the North American Electric Reliability Council,  
said there likely will be ``only minimal impact'' of the 
``nuisance'' variety on electricity production and distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't feel there's going to be a problem keeping the lights  
on,'' Gerry Cauley, the council's program manager for the Y2K 
review, told a news conference Monday. But when asked whether he 
could guarantee a trouble-free transition into year 2000 for power 
companies, Cauley hedged. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one will stand up here and give you ... a guarantee,'' he  
said. ``There's just enough uncertainty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Utilities are spending more than $2 billion to test and prepare  
their computers and replace software to deal with the Y2K problem, 
which occurs when computers -- unless software is adapted -- read the 
year 2000 as 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	The electric utility industry preparedness has been a special  
concern of Congress and the Clinton administration since the 
electricity grid is tightly interconnected and a widespread 
distribution could have major impact. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no evidence at this time that the Y2K problem will  
create national failures in electric power service,'' agreed John 
Koskinen, chairman of the president's Council on Year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	But Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said he was concerned that  
a small number of companies are not expected to meet a midyear 
target of having all their critical systems ``Y2K'' ready. 
</P>
<P>
	``That there are no show stoppers that would threaten the  
nation's electricity supplies is welcome news,'' said Richardson. 
But, he added, ``in the Y2K readiness league, our goal must be to 
have a 1.000 percent batting average.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Gent, the reliability council's president, said only a  
few facilities will miss the June readiness target ``mostly because 
of scheduled outages and other planning considerations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he expected everyone to be ready by September when there  
will be a ``dress rehearsal'' to see how utilities react to a 
simulation of the end-of-year Y2K scenario. 
</P>
<P>
	While considerable work remains to be done, the council's report  
concluded that ``findings continue to indicate that transmission 
through critical year 2000 rollover dates is expected to have 
minimal impact on electric system operation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Acknowledging some public concern about potential problems at  
nuclear power plants, Gent said ``no Y2K problem has been found 
that would prevent any safety system from shutting down a plant in 
an emergency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gent said about half of the utilities have finished testing  
operationally critical components of their power plant, 
transmission and distribution systems. And he said 98 percent of 
all utilities are participating in the industry-wide readiness 
assessment program.

<HEADLINE> Owners To Vote on Marlins Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) -- Having turned the Florida Marlins from a  
World Series champion into a doormat, H. Wayne Huizenga will 
complete his baseball career this week when his $150 million sale 
of the team to John Henry is approved by owners. 
</P>
<P>
	No opposition has emerged to the deal, which was agreed to Nov.  
6. Commissioner Bud Selig expects a vote Wednesday or Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Huizenga founded the expansion team, which began play in 1993.  
Angered when government officials wouldn't fund a new ballpark, 
Huizenga started a record payroll purge immediately after the 
Marlins beat Cleveland in Game 7 of the 1997 World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida's payroll dropped from $52.5 million to $19.1 million,  
and the Marlins went 54-108, the worst record ever for a defending 
champion and the poorest record in the National League since 1969. 
Just four players remain from the World Series roster: Antonio 
Alfonseca, Craig Counsell, Cliff Floyd and Livan Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry, a commodities trader from Boca Raton, Fla., wants a new  
ballpark and says that if the government doesn't pay for it, he 
would provide the money himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed $75 million purchase of the Kansas City Royals by  
Miles Prentice's group from the estate of Ewing Kauffman will not 
be voted on this week. Prentice and the Royals announced the deal 
Nov. 13, but his group has more than two dozen investors, 
necessitating months of background checks. 
</P>
<P>
	At the meetings, Selig will tell owners he intends to start  
stricter enforcement of baseball's 60-40 rule -- a team's debt can't 
exceed 40 percent of its assets -- which he hopes will restrain 
spending on players by high-revenue teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Dodgers signed pitcher Kevin Brown to a $105 million,  
seven-year contract last month, some small markets have said they 
have no chance and are pushing for change after the 2001 season, 
when the collective bargaining agreement is likely to expire. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of initiatives underway, but that's for the  
future,'' Selig said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan to switch authority over umpires from the American and  
National leagues to the commissioner's office, originally scheduled 
for a vote this week, was put off and won't go into effect until 
2000 at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires have a labor contract with the AL and NL, not the  
commissioner's office. If owners switched authority without the 
umpires' approval, they would have been liable for up to $400,000 
per umpire in termination pay, according to a baseball official 
familiar with the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The labor deal with umpires expires after this season and a  
switch is likely next year. Selig wants umpires to report to former 
Oakland president Sandy Alderson, the new executive vice president 
for baseball operations of the commissioner's office.

<HEADLINE>  Johnson Playing Like a Top NFL Pick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- Of all the memorable plays Keyshawn  
Johnson made in helping the New York Jets reach the AFC 
championship game, the easiest one got the most attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Except from Johnson.  
</P>
<P>
	Johnson put on a performance for the ages in Sunday's 34-24  
victory over Jacksonville, catching nine passes for 121 yards and a 
touchdown; running twice on end-arounds for 28 yards, including a 
10-yard score; recovering a fumbled lateral by Jaguars safety Chris 
Hudson that thwarted any first-half momentum the visitors might 
have gained; blocking like a fiend, including laying out defensive 
end Joel Smeenge on one of Curtis Martin's touchdown runs; and 
intercepting Mark Brunell's desperation pass at the end of the 
Jets' seventh straight win. 
</P>
<P>
	Not since Jack Manders did it for the 1937 Bears against  
Washington in the NFL title game has a player had TDs rushing and 
receiving, recovered a fumble and intercepted a pass. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcasters couldn't get enough of the interception, when  
Johnson was used in a prevent defense and outleaped shorter 
receivers and defenders to snag the ball. Television clips of that 
play permeated the airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was nothing innovative,'' coach Bill Parcells said. ``He is  
the tallest guy who can jump, just like a 7-footer you put 
underneath (in basketball), not at the top of the key. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's tall and we want to be the first one to get our hands on  
the ball. That's what we plan to do on the last play, how we deploy 
our players and defend it. We've been practicing that for well over 
six weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Johnson was thrilled with his role on defense -- he  
practically threw Pro Bowl cornerback Aaron Glenn to the turf while 
making the interception -- he was far more interested in discussing 
the fumble recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	When Curtis Martin lost the ball at the Jaguars 18, Hudson  
scooped it up and headed the other way. He was about to be hit by 
quarterback Vinny Testaverde at the New York 40 when Hudson decided 
to lateral. The ball bounced on the turf and was recovered by ... 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing I'm going to do is run,'' said Johnson, a Pro Bowl  
receiver in his third NFL season after being the top overall pick 
in the 1996 draft. ``I'm going to make damn sure I catch him 
somewhere down the line. If you don't hustle, they have the ball 
and the game is a whole other situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I'm slow, so I took off after him. If they don't  
catch him, I'll make sure I will. When he went to lateral, someone 
batted it and I was right there. That comes from hustling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anyone who has seen Johnson play would have no qualms about his  
hustle. That impressed Parcells immediately upon taking over the 
franchise in 1997, just after the Jets finished a 1-15 season in 
which Johnson was criticized for writing an acid-tinged 
autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
	``He enjoys that kind of competition,'' Parcells said. ``He's  
very tough mentally and physically. I really take my hat off to 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a well-developing player. What I like about him is he is  
ready for the next thing on his plate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson hopes that means getting even more action in Denver.  
</P>
<P>
	``I try and play big in every game, no matter what it's for or  
where it is,'' he said. ``You have to make every game important to 
you. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just try and play,'' Johnson added. ``I don't have to demand  
the ball with these coaches. They know and recognize talent and how 
to exploit defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a rookie, I had to demand the ball, because we were losing  
and they weren't getting it to me. Here, you don't even have to say 
nothing. They understand. They know what it takes to beat people.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. Coach Ends Grade Lockout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Calif. (AP) -- The NBA lockout is over. In this case,  
NBA stood for No Bad Attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
	Richmond High School coach Ken Carter kept his team out of the  
gym for a week in order to push them to improve their academics. 
The lockout ended just in time for Tuesday night's league opener 
against St. Elizabeth's of Oakland. Richmond won 61-51. 
</P>
<P>
	``The young men met the challenge, turned in homework and  
attended class,'' Carter said Monday after the first practice in a 
week. ``This is the only lockout where everybody won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carter, whose varsity team is 14-0, closed the gym and banned  
all basketball-related activities, including rallies, because 15 of 
the basketball program's 45 players weren't living up to the 
classroom achievements they promised to fulfill in contracts they 
signed in September. 
</P>
<P>
	All team members had the 2.0 GPA required to play, but some fell  
below the 2.3 they agreed to maintain in the contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	The student athletes gathered in the library Monday when school  
officials announced the end of the lockout. They roared approval 
and gave each other high fives. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first, I didn't understand why my dad did this,'' said  
Carter's son, Damien, who plays on the team and has a 3.7 grade 
point average. ``Then I finally realized what he was trying to do; 
he is showing love for the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carter locked the gym after teachers complained some players  
were ignoring homework and skipping school. 
</P>
<P>
	After a week of tutoring, Carter and athletic director Roy  
Rogers reviewed the latest round of progress reports. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our main goal here was to teach the boys that education,  
unlike athletics, is a thing that can't be taken from you,'' Rogers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The team missed one game, last Friday's non-league encounter.  
Carter hopes to reschedule the contest later in the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Junior guard Chris Dixon said Carter's decision was the right  
one. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are always consequences,'' Dixon said. ``Everyone needs  
to handle their business in the classroom like they do on the 
court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lockout might not have had much of an effect, according to  
economics teacher Bill Erkkila. He has a varsity player in his 
class who has turned in only eight of 28 assignments. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Carter's idea was a good one, but it was too late to  
change much,'' the teacher said.

<HEADLINE> Cholesterol Drug Works for Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Boys born with a genetically caused cholesterol  
disorder that virtually dooms them to heart disease can benefit 
from taking a drug widely used among adults, researchers reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	In a yearlong study, the drug lovastatin significantly lowered  
inherited high cholesterol among boys ages 10 to 17. The disorder, 
which affects about 500,000 Americans, cannot be controlled by 
diet. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug, introduced in 1987 and sold under the name Mevacor,  
caused no harm to boys' growth or sexual development, which can be 
a concern when adult drugs are used to treat children, researchers 
said in today's Journal of the American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	While other studies have indicated the effectiveness of  
lovastatin on children, the new study is the longest and largest to 
date. Mevacor is marketed by Merck &AMP; Co. Inc., which helped fund 
the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Lovastatin and five similar cholesterol-lowering drugs in the  
same family are being used to treat children with inherited high 
cholesterol, but doctors have had scant research in children to 
back up the practice, said the lead author, Dr. Evan Stein of the 
Metabolic and Atherosclerosis Research Center in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	Without treatment, 23 percent of boys with inherited high  
cholesterol will die of heart disease by age 50, he and his 
colleagues said, citing previous research. Girls also can have 
inherited high cholesterol, which greatly increases their risk of 
early heart disease, although less than in boys. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study involving 132 boys, those who took lovastatin saw  
significant decreases in their cholesterol. Trials of 
cholesterol-lowering drugs on adults have clearly shown a reduction 
in heart disease corresponding to lowered cholesterol; presumably, 
the boys will reap the same benefit when they grow older, 
researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The boys had an average of more than twice the normal level of  
so-called ``bad'' cholesterol, or LDL cholesterol, in their blood, 
Stein said. Those levels declined by 17 percent, 24 percent and 27 
percent in the boys receiving daily dosages of 10, 20 and 40 
milligrams of lovastatin, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	No significant differences were found between boys taking  
lovastatin and those taking a placebo in rates of growth and sexual 
maturation, which included extensive hormone tests and measurement 
of testicular growth, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, led by  
Dr. Basil Rifkind, said the study is valuable and important but 
more research is needed to determine if cholesterol-lowering drugs 
will be safe over a lifetime when people start taking them at a 
young age.

<HEADLINE> Escena Sells for Record $3.25M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Escena, winner of the $2 million Breeders'  
Cup Distaff last fall, was sold Tuesday for a record $3.25 million 
at the January Horses of All Ages Sale at Keeneland. 
</P>
<P>
	Madeline and Allen Paulson sold the mare to central Kentucky  
bloodstock agent Reynolds Bell Jr., as agent for Guy Snowden, for 
the highest price ever paid for a broodmare or broodmare prospect 
in the history of the 43-year-old sale. 
</P>
<P>
	The old record was $3 million, paid by Shadwell Farm in 1986 for  
the broodmare Lucky Lucky Lucky, a Grade I winner in foal to 
Northern Dancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The record for any horse in the January sale is $3.4 million,  
paid a year ago by Irish bloodstock agent Demi O'Byrne for a 
yearling filly by Seeking the Gold out of Number. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the second day of the sale, 265 horses sold for  
$20,506,900, an average of $77,385. 
</P>
<P>
	During the first two days of the five-day sale, 514 horses were  
sold for $30,556,300, an average of $59,448.

<HEADLINE> Stage Set for Impeachment Drama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House impeachment team readied opening  
arguments on Tuesday for President Clinton's Senate trial, while 
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart ridiculed their written filings 
as ``overblown rhetoric'' alleging sinister plots. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll leave the invective to Mr. Lockhart,'' retorted Rep.  
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the point man in the case against the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	With the trial to resume at 1 p.m. EST on Thursday, Lockhart  
also told reporters Clinton intends to stay busy on other matters 
while the proceedings unfold in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The president will deliver his State of the Union speech before  
a joint session of Congress on Jan. 19, for example, and travel to 
Buffalo, N.Y., and Montgomery County, Pa., outside Philadelphia, 
the following day to tout his domestic agenda. According to a 
tentative schedule released in the Senate, Clinton's attorneys 
would be presenting his defense both days. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton stands accused of perjury and obstruction of justice in  
the two articles of impeachment that cleared the House last year. 
His Senate trial is only the second such presidential proceeding in 
American history, 131 years after Andrew Johnson was acquitted in 
1868. 
</P>
<P>
	House officials have until noon on Wednesday to turn over the  
written record in Clinton's impeachment case. Democratic sources, 
who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they would carefully 
scrutinize the submission to make sure it did not include material 
that is irrelevant to the two articles of impeachment passed by the 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential allies are prepared to object if they believe the  
House has included material that was not part of the two articles, 
these sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	They added that Abbe D. Lowell, the lead lawyer for House  
Judiciary Committee Democrats during proceedings in the House, had 
met with Senate Democratic aides recently and would be reviewing 
the material. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican members of the House Judiciary Committee will present  
the case for Clinton's removal from office. Pending last minute 
changes, Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois will make brief opening 
comments, followed by Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, who 
will speak for about an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Republicans, including Reps. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas,  
James Rogan of California and Ed Bryant of Tennessee, will detail 
the evidence, after which Rep. Bill McCollum of Florida is expected 
to deliver a summary. 
</P>
<P>
	Reps. Bob Barr of Georgia, Chris Cannon of Utah, George Gekas of  
Pennsylvania, and Steve Chabot of Ohio will discuss the laws 
governing perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Reps. Charles Canady of Florida, Lindsey Graham of South  
Carolina and Steven Buyer of Indiana will address the issues of 
impeachable offenses, and either Hyde or Rogan, a former 
prosecutor, will make closing arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate schedule sets aside 24 hours for the House to make  
its case -- three eight-hour days, for example -- to be followed by 
24 hours for the White House to present its defense. Afterward, the 
Senate will have 16 hours to pose questions to the two sides. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a tentative calendar, that takes up the time through  
Saturday, Jan. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	At that point, the White House or a Senate Democratic ally is  
expected to seek dismissal of the charges, and the House is 
expected to counter with a request for witnesses, with no firm 
expectation of how long that takes. 
</P>
<P>
	Few, if any, senators are predicting that Clinton will be  
stripped of the presidency -- a step that requires a two-thirds 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	And Lockhart was biting during the day in comments made about a  
lengthy trial brief submitted by House prosecutors on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is at times a hallmark of what's a weak factual and  
constitutional case that the allegations continue to shift, and 
that the rhetoric continues to be overblown,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I mean, I think there is overblown rhetoric in there about  
sinister plots, and I think that it detracts from the argument they 
are trying to make,'' he added.

<HEADLINE> Quayle Bashes Clinton on Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Vice President Dan Quayle, a likely GOP  
presidential candidate, said today that national security should be 
a major issue in the 2000 campaign and offered a critical 
assessment of President Clinton's foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``No presidential candidate should be taken seriously unless he  
or she understands the importance of foreign policy,'' Quayle told 
the conservative Heritage Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	He refused to critique potential rivals, but said in an  
interview afterward when asked about Texas Gov. George W. Bush's 
foreign policy abilities, ``Clearly experience helps. I don't need 
on-the-job training.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle said the Clinton administration ``frittered away''  
opportunities left by his boss, former President Bush. Clinton has 
stumbled with regard to policies in China, Cuba, Iraq, North Korea 
and Russia, on terrorism and strategic defense initiatives and in 
his duties to support troops and defense technology, Quayle 
asserted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Major issues are being ignored, standards are lowered. There's  
a sinking feeling around the world that American has simply lost 
its will and credibility to lead,'' Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Indiana senator, now based in Arizona, is expected to  
soon announce his intentions for 2000.

<HEADLINE> Official May Discuss Sydney Bribes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- A key figure in Sydney's successful bid  
for the 2000 Olympics says he's prepared to name people who sought 
bribes from him while claiming to represent IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bruce Baird, the New South Wales government's Olympics  
Minister at the time of the 1993 bid process, said the 
International Olympic Committee has so far ignored his offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have indicated that I am quite happy to provide evidence to  
the head of this inquiry at the moment, but I have got to say the 
phone is strangely silent,'' Baird said today. ``I think they're 
trying to limit it to Salt Lake City. They haven't approached me, 
it may be useful if they did. '' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC is investigating allegations that Salt Lake City  
organizers used bribes to help win the rights to stage the 2002 
Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	If the current inquiry fails to uncover the names, Baird said he  
would take the information directly to IOC vice president Dick 
Pound. 
</P>
<P>
	``It depends what comes out. If they name the people that  
approached me the situation is covered, then so be it,'' Baird 
said. ``If not, I will approach them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly have got nothing to hide and I would be perfectly  
happy to participate in any inquiry, maybe some of the other cities 
may not be so keen. As far as Sydney is concerned the books are 
wide open, we are happy to talk about it and discuss it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile Australian swimming star Kieren Perkins, a two-time  
1,500-meter freestyle winner and a member of the Sydney bid team, 
said he was disgusted by the bribery scandal. But Perkins said the 
Olympic movement is no more immune from corruption than other 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking about a multibillion dollar event,'' Perkins  
said. ``If you get down to tin tacks with anybody who is bidding 
for a multibillion dollar project, there's often a bit of funny 
business involved with the bidding process. It's no different in 
any industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a horrible shame that it happens in a sporting event  
because I'd like to think that we're immune from that sort of 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``But this is a huge multibillion dollar industry and while  
that's the case I think it's going to be hard to stop people doing 
everything they can to win the contracts. That's really what it is.

<HEADLINE> Revlon To Cut Up to 1,200 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Revlon Inc. will cut its work force by as much  
as 1,200 jobs in the latest restructuring effort by the struggling 
cosmetics giant. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also will sell some real estate holdings under the  
reorganization plan announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The job cuts, which will come through layoffs and attrition,  
involves about 7 percent of the company's total work force. 
</P>
<P>
	The efforts expand on Revlon's October announcement that it  
would close three international plants to save costs. Revlon's 
stock was up 6 1/4 cents at $19 in afternoon trading on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The restructuring comes amid tough times for Revlon, which is  
the best-selling mass-market cosmetics brand in the country, ahead 
of Procter &AMP; Gamble's Cover Girl and L'Oreal's Maybelline lines. 
Revlon also sells cosmetics under the Almay and Ultima II brands. 
</P>
<P>
	Revlon has been hurt by global economic turmoil, especially in  
South America and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Also troubling has been a slowdown in orders from U.S.  
retailers. Its biggest losses have been at drug stores, with 
merchants using up existing inventory before ordering more. 
</P>
<P>
	Revlon's third-quarter profits fell by 62 percent from a year  
ago, and the company missed its sales targets by nearly $100 
million. It will release its fourth-quarter results in early 
February. 
</P>
<P>
	The company expects to take an $80 million charge to fund the  
restructuring -- $40 million in the fourth quarter and the remainder 
in 1999. It expects to save $30 million to $40 million annual after 
the changes are in place. 
</P>
<P>
	Revlon said it was comfortable with Wall Street analysts'  
estimates of $1.55 a share, before charges, for 1999. It did, 
however, acknowledge that the inventory problems and uncertainty 
over its businesses abroad will affect its results.

<HEADLINE> Judge Asks About Microsoft Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The judge who will decide the Microsoft  
antitrust case pointedly asked a government witness Tuesday whether 
the company is following a strategy of ``delayed gratification'' by 
keeping its software prices low. 
</P>
<P>
	As the government prepared to end its case after 10 weeks at  
trial, the unexpected question posed by U.S. District Judge Thomas 
Penfield Jackson appeared to undermine a key Microsoft defense: If 
the company wields such power in the high-tech industry, why 
doesn't it raise prices more? 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's first witness, economist Richard Schmalensee, who is  
expected to take the stand Wednesday, told the judge in written 
testimony that if the company wielded monopoly power, it would 
charge computer makers ``at least 16 times'' more for its Windows 
operating system than its current prices, which are a closely 
guarded secret, but believed to be $45 to $65. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside court, Stephen Houck, the lead lawyer for the 19 states  
suing Microsoft with the Justice Department, called Schmalensee 
``one of the only economists -- one of the few people in the country 
-- who refuses to acknowledge that Microsoft has a monopoly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft wants to convince the judge that it doesn't possess  
monopoly power because many of the government's claims of 
predatory, anti-competitive behavior hinge on that definition. 
</P>
<P>
	But the judge asked the final government witness Tuesday whether  
Microsoft might be strategically setting prices for Windows lower 
than it might otherwise with its eye on future profits. He called 
it ``a concept of delayed gratification.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``As more and more people become interested in using PCs, they  
will buy PCs so long as the overall cost is something they can 
afford. Otherwise, they'll buy a larger television set,'' Jackson 
said, asking whether Microsoft might be looking to long-term 
profits ``by keeping its contribution to the cost of a PC low.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's entirely possible, your honor,'' answered economist  
Franklin Fisher, who was expected to finish testifying Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges that Microsoft illegally bundled its  
Internet browser software free into newer versions of Windows to 
``crush'' rival Netscape, whose own popular browser is a direct 
competitor and earned tens of millions of dollars when it dominated 
the browser market. 
</P>
<P>
	Government lawyers say Microsoft was motivated by the fear that  
Internet software eventually might assume many roles that Windows 
now performs as a computer's central nervous system. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher asserted that Microsoft's ability to raise prices ``might  
be exercised later. To assume a monopolist with power will not 
always exercise the power is to rely on the benevolence of the 
monopolist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft was expected to question Fisher again briefly  
Wednesday, marking the end of the government case and the start of 
Microsoft calling witnesses. The trial is expected to last until 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	In a rare appearance at the courthouse, U.S. Assistant Attorney  
General Joel I. Klein lauded government lawyers for showing a 
``pattern of anti-competitive practices'' that resulted in 
``restricted consumer choice, stifled innovation, and led to higher 
prices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to e-mails introduced during the trial, Klein also  
cited ``an extraordinary mountain of evidence that this company did 
not compete on the merits.''

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Trial's Old Tyme Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Like the brass spittoons that still adorn the  
Senate floor, the impeachment trial of President Clinton is 
controlled by arcane rules rooted in the 19th century. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, all Senate debate on impeachment matters is done  
behind closed doors, but votes are taken in public. Senators must 
submit most questions in writing through the presiding officer, in 
this case Chief Justice William Rehnquist. 
</P>
<P>
	Each trial day will even begin with the quaint ``Hear ye! Hear  
ye! Hear ye!'' of the Senate sergeant-at-arms. 
</P>
<P>
	Constitutional scholar Alan Hirsch, in his ``Citizen's Guide to  
Impeachment,'' said most of the rules were written for the 1868 
trial of President Andrew Johnson. ``These rules have remained 
virtually unchanged,'' Hirsch said. 
</P>
<P>
	To some of the participants, that formality should be a good  
thing at the close of the 20th century. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will help us keep to the solemnity of the event,''  
Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., said Tuesday. ``It will also bring more 
manners and more decorum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning Thursday and through Jan. 26, a trial schedule  
outlined by Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., envisions senators 
meeting at 1 p.m. most days, with Saturday sessions also likely. 
That would leave weekday mornings for other legislative business. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless senators decide to change the rules, perhaps the most  
noticeable difference between regular Senate business and the 
impeachment trial will be the silence on the part of 100 highly 
talkative politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules say that senators can't debate impeachment issues in  
public and can't even engage in a question-and-answer discussion 
among themselves. They can only directly address Rehnquist to make 
motions, raise objections or ask procedural questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Some senators don't like the requirement for debate in secrecy.  
Two Democrats, Tom Harkin of Iowa and Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, 
plan to seek a vote on a rules change that would require all 
deliberations to be in public. 
</P>
<P>
	Support for the change, however, appears lukewarm at best.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think historically we're locked into this by the rules of  
the past,'' said Sen. Dick Lugar, R-Ind., who added he isn't 
necessarily opposed to more openness. 
</P>
<P>
	Another quirk in the rules is the power of the presiding  
officer. While it is Rehnquist's task to decide all sorts of 
questions, from witness testimony to evidence, the Senate can 
overrule him by a simple majority vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The House ``managers,'' or prosecutors, and the White House  
lawyers can also object to questions posed to witnesses or the 
introduction of evidence. Once again, Rehnquist's rulings are 
subject to potential majority votes of the Senate -- but only a 
senator can request such as vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Rehnquist, however, does have authority to break any ties.  
</P>
<P>
	As both judge and jury, senators are allowed to question both  
the House and White House and any witnesses. But their queries must 
be submitted in writing to Rehnquist -- who would actually ask them 
-- and they are subject to an objection by either side. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial can be halted by majority vote at almost any time. The  
Senate has set aside Jan. 25 to decide a motion to dismiss and 
possibly to issue subpoenas for witnesses. Other motions are 
possible and can be made later as well. 
</P>
<P>
	One rule left out of a Senate impeachment trial is a threshold  
of evidence, or burden of proof, required to convict Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all going to have to think that through,'' said Sen. Ted  
Stevens, R-Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules also are silent on censure, which Clinton has said he  
could accept. If the Senate were to acquit the president or dismiss 
the case, it might later vote on a censure resolution as part of 
its regular business. 
</P>
<P>
	Once all the evidence and testimony is in, the rules say the  
doors to the Senate should be closed. Each senator is permitted to 
speak just once, for no longer than 15 minutes, on whether Clinton 
should be convicted and removed from office. 
</P>
<P>
	When senators are ready to vote, the chamber's doors will be  
flung open and Rehnquist will ask each of them in turn: ``Senator, 
how say you? Is the respondent, William Jefferson Clinton, 
president of the United States, guilty or not guilty?'' 
</P>
<P>
	A two-thirds vote, or 67 of the 100 senators, is necessary for a  
conviction on each of the two articles of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	On this question, there is no appeal.

<HEADLINE> Revival of `On the Town' To Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York, New York. It's a lonely town -- and an  
expensive one. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the Town,'' a revival of the 1944 Leonard Bernstein  
musical, will close Sunday after a 65-performance run and an 
estimated $6 million loss. 
</P>
<P>
	The show was the brainchild of George C. Wolfe, artistic  
director of the Joseph Papp Public Theater-New York Shakespeare 
Festival. Wolfe directed the musical in Central Park in 1997 and 
the Public Theater, one of country's most prominent nonprofit 
theaters, financed the entire Broadway production. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had hoped that with a television commercial and a direct  
mail campaign, as well as a number of extremely positive reviews, 
that we would be able to surmount the annual January doldrums on 
Broadway,'' Wolfe said in a statement. ``This unfortunately was not 
the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``On the Town,'' which has book and lyrics by Betty Comden and  
Adolph Green, follows three sailors during a 24-hour leave in 
wartime New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The revival, which jettisoned Jerome Robbins' original  
choreography, had a troubled history. Beginning with the Central 
Park production, it went through four choreographers and numerous 
cast changes before opening Nov. 21 at Broadway's Gershwin Theater.

<HEADLINE> More Accusations for Columbia-HCA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A Texas division of Columbia-HCA Healthcare  
Corp. made false billings for hospital supplies and set up a shell 
medical laboratory to funnel kickbacks to doctors, according to the 
latest documents unsealed in the federal investigation of the 
nation's largest hospital chain. 
</P>
<P>
	The accusations were revealed in an FBI affidavit for search  
warrants, filed in July 1997, and made public Monday in response to 
an order from a federal judge in Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	About a dozen pages in the 74-page document still remain under  
seal. Other parts of the document were unveiled in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The information unsealed Monday contains accusations of fraud  
and kickbacks in the Nashville, Tenn.-based Columbia's El Paso 
division. An informant described as an internal auditor and 
troubleshooter for Columbia told the FBI he had alerted Columbia's 
senior vice president about the false billings and shell lab, 
according to the affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issues in yesterday's unsealing really are nothing new,''  
said Jeff Prescott, spokesman for Columbia. ``The home care and 
physician relations issues are things we've been in discussion with 
the government for a year. It really doesn't raise new issues for 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government has charged four mid-level Columbia managers with  
conspiring to defraud the government of $2.8 million by disguising 
certain Medicare claims to reap more money than they were due. They 
have all pleaded innocent. A trial has been set for May.

<HEADLINE> Colorado Outgoing Gov. OKs Clemency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- On his last full day as governor, Gov. Roy Romer  
granted clemency to three women and one man convicted of killing 
people they say abused them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not trying to encourage people to use force, but sometimes  
you have to understand the human circumstance,'' Romer said Monday. 
He finishes 12 years as governor today and remains co-chairman of 
the Democratic National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Debra Muniz, sentenced to six years for the shooting death of  
her husband, had her sentence commuted to two years already served. 
Her 23-year-old son, Zachariah Muniz, had his six-year sentence 
commuted to parole. 
</P>
<P>
	Romer said he believed the two deserved mercy because they saw  
no other escape from Dwayne Muniz, who had a reputation for beating 
his wife and children. Romer said authorities had failed to help 
the family. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other women had their sentences reduced, though neither will  
be up for parole immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Romer refused to grant clemency to four women who also claimed  
they killed abusers. On each of the decisions, he agreed with a 
special advisory panel he created to review requests for clemency. 
</P>
<P>
	During his administration, Romer worked to strengthen laws and  
penalties for domestic violence offenders and to improve prevention 
and services for victims. Despite his efforts, some who advocated 
for clemency said the law does not provide enough protection for 
victims of domestic violence.

	House Readies Impeachment Evidence  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House impeachment team readied opening  
arguments today for President Clinton's Senate trial, while White 
House spokesman Joe Lockhart ridiculed their written filings as 
``overblown rhetoric'' that alleges sinister plots. With the trial 
to resume at 1 p.m. EST on Thursday, Lockhart also told reporters 
Clinton intends to stay busy on other matters while the proceedings 
unfold in the Senate. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Mails Check to Paula Jones  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton mailed a check for $850,000  
to Paula Jones today to settle her sexual harassment allegations, 
officially ending the sex harassment legal battle that cast his 
presidency into crisis. The president drew about $375,000 from his 
and Hillary Rodham Clinton's personal funds and got the rest of the 
settlement, about $475,000, from an insurance policy, a White House 
official told The Associated Press. ``This ends it. The check is 
being fed-exed'' to Bill McMillan, one of Mrs. Jones' lawyers, said 
the official. 

</P>
<P>
	Conservation Plan Unveiled  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton unveiled a plan today to  
triple spending in an effort to preserve vulnerable lands from the 
California desert to the Florida Everglades. ``Our population is 
growing, our cities are growing, our commitment to conservation 
must grow as well,'' Clinton said in announcing the $1 billion 
spending proposal during a ceremony at the National Arboretum. The 
``land-legacy initiative'' calls for adding thousands of acres to 
the system of federally protected lands and providing states with 
nearly $600 million for land preservation.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has spoken  
with associates about a possible run for governor of Georgia in 
2002, a post no Republican has held since Reconstruction, GOP 
sources said today. Gingrich had once been mentioned as a possible 
contender for the Republican presidential nomination in 2000, but 
that talk faded with the GOP loss of House seats in November and 
his subsequent decision to leave Congress.

	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Two gunmen on a motorcycle opened  
fire today on a vehicle carrying the sister of Haitian President 
Rene Preval, wounding her and killing her driver, a local radio 
station reported. Marie-Claude Calvin was being treated for two 
gunshot wounds to the chest, Radio Quisqueya reported. The attack 
comes a day after Preval announced that he would bypass Haiti's 
combative Parliament and appoint a new government by decree -- a 
move that critics said will set the troubled Caribbean nation on 
the road to dictatorship once again.

	Audit: IRS System a Privacy Risk  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chronic weaknesses in the IRS computer system  
are putting sensitive personal information about taxpayers at risk 
of improper uses, including theft and fraud, according to an audit 
released today. The audit by the congressional General Accounting 
Office of six IRS facilities also found that 397 computer tapes 
containing taxpayer data had been lost. ``Personal information on 
IRS computers is at risk to unauthorized disclosure, destruction or 
modification, and most alarmingly, to identity theft,'' said Senate 
Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., who 
requested the audit.

beating Wall Street expectations as its revenue nearly tripled. The 
popular Internet site operator reported today its earnings equaled 
16 cents per share on a diluted basis for the quarter ended Dec.

<HEADLINE> Monica Monica Mulls House Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- To her friends, she's known as Monica  
Squared. And she has her sights set on Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Monica L. Monica is planning to run for the House seat being  
vacated by fellow Republican Bob Livingston amid fallout from the 
Clinton-Lewinsky matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a politically cute trick,'' the 48-year-old  
ophthalmologist said. ``I was Monica long before the other one was. 
It's on my driver's license.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's the actual name she was given by her father, Elihu Root  
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
	``I asked him, `Did you stutter, or what?' He said, `I loved you  
so much and felt so much honor in the name that I named you 
twice,''' Ms. Monica recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	Livingston, the Speaker designate, announced Dec. 19 that he  
would leave Congress within six months because Hustler's Larry 
Flynt was about to publish details about his adulterous affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other person to say he will definitely run is former Ku  
Klux Klan leader David Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Monica's grandfather, an Italian immigrant, named his four  
sons for famous Americans: Woodrow Wilson, Teddy Roosevelt, Russell 
Sage, Elihu Root. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Monica said: ``I will take my name and make it as individual  
and as honorable as it was given to me by my father.''

<HEADLINE> Individuals Fuel Web Stock Frenzy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Online investors -- empowered by easy clicks,  
tiny trading costs and passionate feelings about the World Wide 
Web's potential for everything -- are helping to fuel an Internet 
stock rally that many professionals consider perilous. 
</P>
<P>
	Mutual funds and other big investors, which are usually  
responsible for driving the stock market, have largely shunned the 
buying frenzy. They are worried that stocks that have doubled and 
tripled in weeks, or even days, may fall just as quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	This phenomenon is particularly important to understand as  
Internet companies begin reporting their fourth-quarter financial 
performance this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo!, the popular Internet site and Web search engine,  
impressed Wall Street with a strong report late Tuesday, but it's 
unclear whether lesser-known players will be able to justify their 
high-flying stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Most don't even have profits, and will only need to show higher  
sales or even declining losses in order to spark even more buying 
of their shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the slightest disappointment could cause a major reversal.  
</P>
<P>
	One of the chief reasons why individual investors are venturing  
into waters that the professionals are avoiding is that the 
Internet itself has made it so easy for people to move in and out 
of stocks every day. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have firms advertising that they can set up people as day  
traders. Give them `X' amount of money, and they'll give you the 
software and the machinery,'' said Barry Berman, head trader at 
Robert W. Baird, a Milwaukee-based investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Most eye-catching in this high-stakes game have been the daily  
moonshots fueled by Internet-related announcements from online 
newcomers and older companies trying to reinvent themselves. Last 
November, for instance, book store operator Books-A-Million 
announced the revamping of its Web site and saw its shares triple 
in one day. 
</P>
<P>
	On any given day, and for no apparent reason, an industry  
``veteran'' such as Yahoo! can soar 20 percent from levels that 
already represent a 1,000 percent gain in less than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Since professional money managers must report their performance  
to clients once a month, they have a strong incentive to stick with 
companies that have more dependable profits and stable share 
prices. Surprisingly, the investors who do seem willing to take 
chances are those with far less experience and much shallower 
pockets. 
</P>
<P>
	``In general, you don't see institutions paying the kind of  
(prices) you've got on those kinds of stocks,'' said Berman. He 
noted that a large amount of trading in Internet-related companies 
is being conducted in 200- or 300-share blocks rather than the 
thousands often bought and sold in each trade by major portfolio 
managers. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the few mutual funds that bill themselves as cyber-minded  
rarely stray beyond the big names like AOL and Yahoo! 
</P>
<P>
	The Robertson Stephens Information Age Fund, which normally  
devotes about 65 percent of its portfolio to the information 
technology industry, counted America Online, Amazon.com and Yahoo! 
among its top ten holdings at the end of September. 
</P>
<P>
	But those three stocks accounted for only about 13 percent of  
the fund's holdings, while about a third of its assets were tied up 
in plain old hardware and software giants such as Intel, Microsoft 
and Compaq Computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Naturally, since mutual funds don't need to disclose all their  
day-to-day dealings, it's likely that many are trading in some of 
the more speculative issues. But the Internet stock runup has been 
too frantic, analysts say, to be solely the work of institutional 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	``There can't be that many sophisticated traders out there. Even  
sophisticated traders are avoiding this group because it's a very 
irrational thing that's going on,'' said Ricky Harrington, 
technical analyst at Interstate/Johnson Lane in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way Internet stocks are trading is extremely risky even  
for most sophisticated trader and dynamite for those who are not,'' 
said Harrington, asserting that investors can't possibly expect to 
catch every winning stock or sector.

<HEADLINE> Death Penalty Teach-In Goes Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Some teachers plan to go ahead Thursday  
with a controversial death penalty teach-in focusing on a man 
convicted of killing a Philadelphia policeman. 
</P>
<P>
	The school board president, superintendent and teachers union  
president say the event is insensitive because it falls on the same 
day as a funeral for a slain Oakland officer. 
</P>
<P>
	But some teachers say they want to hold the teach-in, at least  
in modified form, arguing they are obliged to defend academic 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	Superintendent Carole Quan said Monday night she was canceling  
the event, despite an earlier vote by teachers to hold it. 
</P>
<P>
	That ruled out holding assemblies or inviting guest speakers.  
</P>
<P>
	But teachers and district officials said neither Ms. Quan nor  
the school board to whom she reports can interfere with what goes 
on in the classroom provided it falls within district guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	``The teach-in will go on,'' Sheila Quintana, president of the  
Oakland Education Association said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Quintana had recommended that her fellow union members  
postpone the event until Feb. 1 to give organizers time to come up 
with a more balanced lesson plan and avoid any suggestion of 
insensitivity to the death of Officer James Williams. The officer 
was killed by a sniper's bullet Saturday night and was to be buried 
on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the union's representative council voted 48-42 Monday night  
against delay, which has prompted sharp criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	School Board President Noel Gallo said the vote ``clearly will  
demonstrate to our parents that within our teaching profession 
there are those who put their political agendas ahead of basic 
education for our children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The teach-in, planned since October and initially sanctioned by  
Superintendent Carole Quan, was to focus on the case of Abu-Jamal, 
a black activist and radio journalist on death row for killing a 
Philadelphia policeman in 1981.

<HEADLINE>  Falcons' Anderson Confident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- Some athletes are skittish about all the  
hoopla that goes along with playing for a championship. Remember 
Leon Lett's meltdown before the Super Bowl a few years ago? 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's Jamal Anderson.  
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Falcons running back doesn't shy away from the  
moment, he thrives in it. Not unlike the man he calls ``Uncle 
Muhammad'' -- family friend Muhammad Ali -- Anderson figures the 
whole world in his stage, so keep the spotlight shining. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad you're here,'' Anderson told reporters who converged  
on the Falcons training complex Monday to launch a week of hype for 
the NFC championship game. ``You're not going to bother me. I'd 
rather you be here than covering somebody else for the 
championship, so bother me all you want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Pro already has shouldered an inordinate load for the  
Falcons this season, setting an NFL record with 410 carries and a 
franchise mark with 1,846 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
	If Atlanta is to beat the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday, Anderson  
likely will have to produce another of the 30-carry, 100-yard games 
that have become so routine this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons know it. The Vikings know it. Everyone knows it.  
</P>
<P>
	``Every team comes in with a goal to try to shut down our run,''  
Anderson said. ``It's an honor for me, really. I like when teams 
have to prepare to try to shut me down. That's what I thrive on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson has never been shy about touting his abilities. From  
the first day he reported to camp in 1994 as an obscure, 
seventh-round draft pick from Utah, he expected to some day be 
ranked among the game's best runners. 
</P>
<P>
	For some, that sort of attitude comes across as conceited. For  
those who are around him on a regular basis, his braggadocio is 
more charming than annoying. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is talking about how they don't want to see the  
Dirty Bird,'' he crowed, referring to his trademark dance. ``Yada, 
yada, yada. We're coming to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's like a nightclub comic who's act never shuts down. He's  
constantly going about the business of being Jamal, from his 
arm-flapping, end-zone celebration to his good-natured (though 
unsuccessful) campaign for MVP. 
</P>
<P>
	``People say Jamal is arrogant,'' safety Eugene Robinson said.  
``Jamal is just hungry, man. Every time he looks up, Barry Sanders 
is being mentioned, Terrell Davis is being mentioned, everybody's 
name is being mentioned but his. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now he's got a chance to say, `Hey, you better reckon with me.  
I'm going to punish your defensive backs. I'm going to punish your 
linebackers. I'm going to make sure I'm the hardest guy you've ever 
had to tackle.''' 
</P>
<P>
	That he is. Anderson runs lows to the turf, transforming himself  
into a 5-foot-11, 234-pound bowling ball who appears to be nothing 
more than helmet, shoulder pads and knees. While lacking breakaway 
speed, he is deceptively quick. 
</P>
<P>
	``To combine the power he has with the quickness, well, there's  
not very many people that size who can make people miss,'' coach 
Dan Reeves said. ``And when he does get tackled, he's hard to bring 
down. He's got such a low center of gravity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only team to beat the explosive Vikings controlled the clock  
and dominated with the running game. Tampa Bay rushed for a 
team-record 246 yards in its 27-24 victory over Minnesota more than 
two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Anderson-led Falcons are capable of that type of  
performance. They led the NFL in time of possession and held the 
ball for more than 32 minutes in a 20-18 playoff victory over San 
Francisco last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can we beat Minnesota? Oh, I think anybody can be beaten,''  
Anderson said. ``For us to beat them, we have to do what we do 
best, and that's play our style of football. If we do that, then I 
think we can beat them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He doesn't want his season to end at the Metrodome, even though  
he is only 26 years old and most of his career seems ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
	``People say you're young and you'll get to do this over and  
over, but you never know,'' Anderson said. ``Who would have thought 
Dan Marino wouldn't have gotten back to the Super Bowl yet. You 
have to take advantage of every opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So, he is. After four years of virtual obscurity in Atlanta --  
few people seem to realize this in his third straight 1,000-yard 
season -- Anderson is finally in his element, a prime-time player. 
You can almost see the dollar signs flashing in his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully ... we'll get more people buying season tickets and  
we'll get more fans coming out and purchasing my jerseys,'' he 
said, rolling his eyes mischievously. ``I really like it, thank you 
very much. Kids, parents, I love it. Grandparents, whoever wants to 
wear it, I appreciate it.''

	Snow fell from the Dakotas to Ohio and flurries dusted the  
northern Rockies Tuesday while rain showers dampened the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
	A frontal boundary stretching from the northern Plains across  
the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley provided a variety of 
precipitation. 
</P>
<P>
	North of the front, snow fell from the Dakotas across Minnesota,  
Wisconsin, Michigan and northern areas of Illinois, Indiana and 
Ohio. Snow also scattered across the Northeast. Most of the snow 
was light, with amounts between a dusting and two inches. 
</P>
<P>
	South of the snow area, warmer air allowed the precipitation to  
change to rain, which fell from central Indiana across southern 
Ohio. Interior sections of Pennsylvania had a mix of snow, sleet 
and freezing rain. 
</P>
<P>
	A second area of low pressure gave portions of the northern  
Rockies and northern Plains light snow in the early afternoon. Most 
of the snow was confined to Montana, although light snow fell 
across Idaho and Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
	Fair and pleasant weather was seen from the Southeast into the  
southern Plains, where temperatures were warming well into the 50s. 
</P>
<P>
	Farther west, subtropical moisture was working into the southern  
Rockies. Light rain showers were found across eastern Arizona and 
New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Fair and dry weather will persist across California with fog  
remaining across the San Joaquin and Sacramento Valleys. Rain was 
falling across western sections of Washington and Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	By midafternoon, temperatures in the continental United States  
ranged from 75 in West Palm Beach and Homestead, Fla., to minus 36 
in International Falls, Minn. The lowest wind chill was minus 56 in 
Grand Marais, Minn., and the highest wind gust was 47 in Block 
Island, R.I.

<HEADLINE> `Providence' Spurs NBC to Victory / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Providence was the word at NBC, as  
``Providence'' premiered with heavenly ratings and the network won 
the week overall. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC may have a much-needed hit on its hands with this  
replacement for its instant Friday failure ``Trinity.'' On the 
opener, ``Providence'' scored eighth place with a 13.1 household 
rating. It was the best premiere showing by an NBC drama since 
``ER'' in September 1994, the network said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another new show, Fox's Eddie Murphy-created ``The PJs,'' took  
13th place with a 12.6 rating in its Sunday preview airing, to 
become Sunday's most-watched show on any network. This week the 
animated comedy settles in its regular Tuesday slot. 
</P>
<P>
	Two returning series, CBS' ``The Magnificent Seven'' and NBC's  
``Lateline,'' didn't fare so well, socked with 57th and 71st place 
rankings respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	In prime time for the week of Jan. 4 through 10, NBC logged a  
winning 9.8 rating and 15 share, according to Nielsen Media 
Research figures released Tuesday. CBS edged out ABC for second 
place, with a 9.5 rating and 15 share. ABC had a 9.4 rating and 15 
share. Fox (programming 15 hours) had a 7.7 rating and 12 share. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the emerging networks, the WB had a 2.8 rating and 4  
share, while UPN remained behind with a 1.9 rating and 3 share. The 
Pax network had a .7 rating and 1 share. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. Share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the 16-week-old 1998-99 season, CBS is first-place with a  
9.1 rating season-to-date. NBC is runner-up with an 8.7, while ABC 
is 8.5 and Fox 7.1. 
</P>
<P>
	In the evening news derby, ``NBC Nightly News'' retained the top  
spot with a 9.5 rating and 17 share. ABC's ``World News Tonight'' 
was second with a 9.1 rating and 17 share. ``The CBS Evening News'' 
was third with an 8.9 rating and 16 share. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of Jan. 4-10, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
household ratings were: ``ER,'' NBC, 21.7; ``Friends,'' NBC, 17.6; 
Fiesta Bowl: Florida State vs. Tennessee, ABC, 17.2; ``Frasier,'' 
NBC, 16.9; ``Just Shoot Me,'' NBC, 15.7; ``Veronica's Closet,'' 
NBC, 14.7; Fox NFC Playoff: Arizona at Minnesota (First Portion of 
Post-Game Show), Fox, 14.5; ``Providence,'' NBC, 13.1; ``People's 
Choice Awards,'' CBS, and ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, tied at 12.9.

<HEADLINE> Boy in Death Plot Tried As Juvenile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RACINE, Wis. (AP) -- A 16-year-old boy accused of masterminding a  
plot to kill students and educators at his high school will be 
tried as a juvenile. 
</P>
<P>
	The district attorney's office on Tuesday withdrew a petition to  
prosecute the boy as an adult on murder conspiracy charges. 
However, they added three counts of conspiracy to commit false 
imprisonment and three counts of conspiring to take hostages. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for two other 16-year-old boys accused in the plot said  
they had been told by the district attorney's office that their 
clients will be tried as juveniles too. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's wonderful news,'' lawyer Franklyn Gimbel said. ``They're  
being treated as children, as they should.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted in juvenile court, the defendants face up to three  
years in custody, compared with a maximum sentence of 120 years in 
prison if prosecuted as adults. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the boys, whose names were withheld because of their  
age, admitted planning to steal guns and take over Burlington High 
School to kill certain educators and at least 12 students who had 
picked on them. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were tipped off to the plot and the boys were arrested  
Nov. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision not to prosecute the boy as an adult came after the  
recommendations of psychological and criminal justice experts, 
Assistant District Attorney Richard Barta said.

<HEADLINE>  Falcons' Anderson Confident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- Some athletes are skittish about all the  
hoopla that goes along with playing for a championship. Remember 
Leon Lett's meltdown before the Super Bowl a few years ago? 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's Jamal Anderson.  
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Falcons running back doesn't shy away from the  
moment, he thrives in it. Not unlike the man he calls ``Uncle 
Muhammad'' -- family friend Muhammad Ali -- Anderson figures the 
whole world in his stage, so keep the spotlight shining. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad you're here,'' Anderson told reporters who converged  
on the Falcons training complex Monday to launch a week of hype for 
the NFC championship game. ``You're not going to bother me. I'd 
rather you be here than covering somebody else for the 
championship, so bother me all you want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Pro already has shouldered an inordinate load for the  
Falcons this season, setting an NFL record with 410 carries and a 
franchise mark with 1,846 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
	If Atlanta is to beat the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday, Anderson  
likely will have to produce another of the 30-carry, 100-yard games 
that have become so routine this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons know it. The Vikings know it. Everyone knows it.  
</P>
<P>
	``Every team comes in with a goal to try to shut down our run,''  
Anderson said. ``It's an honor for me, really. I like when teams 
have to prepare to try to shut me down. That's what I thrive on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson has never been shy about touting his abilities. From  
the first day he reported to camp in 1994 as an obscure, 
seventh-round draft pick from Utah, he expected to some day be 
ranked among the game's best runners. 
</P>
<P>
	For some, that sort of attitude comes across as conceited. For  
those who are around him on a regular basis, his braggadocio is 
more charming than annoying. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is talking about how they don't want to see the  
Dirty Bird,'' he crowed, referring to his trademark dance. ``Yada, 
yada, yada. We're coming to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's like a nightclub comic who's act never shuts down. He's  
constantly going about the business of being Jamal, from his 
arm-flapping, end-zone celebration to his good-natured (though 
unsuccessful) campaign for MVP. 
</P>
<P>
	``People say Jamal is arrogant,'' safety Eugene Robinson said.  
``Jamal is just hungry, man. Every time he looks up, Barry Sanders 
is being mentioned, Terrell Davis is being mentioned, everybody's 
name is being mentioned but his. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now he's got a chance to say, `Hey, you better reckon with me.  
I'm going to punish your defensive backs. I'm going to punish your 
linebackers. I'm going to make sure I'm the hardest guy you've ever 
had to tackle.''' 
</P>
<P>
	That he is. Anderson runs lows to the turf, transforming himself  
into a 5-foot-11, 234-pound bowling ball who appears to be nothing 
more than helmet, shoulder pads and knees. While lacking breakaway 
speed, he is deceptively quick. 
</P>
<P>
	``To combine the power he has with the quickness, well, there's  
not very many people that size who can make people miss,'' coach 
Dan Reeves said. ``And when he does get tackled, he's hard to bring 
down. He's got such a low center of gravity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only team to beat the explosive Vikings controlled the clock  
and dominated with the running game. Tampa Bay rushed for a 
team-record 246 yards in its 27-24 victory over Minnesota more than 
two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Anderson-led Falcons are capable of that type of  
performance. They led the NFL in time of possession and held the 
ball for more than 32 minutes in a 20-18 playoff victory over San 
Francisco last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can we beat Minnesota? Oh, I think anybody can be beaten,''  
Anderson said. ``For us to beat them, we have to do what we do 
best, and that's play our style of football. If we do that, then I 
think we can beat them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He doesn't want his season to end at the Metrodome, even though  
he is only 26 years old and most of his career seems ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
	``People say you're young and you'll get to do this over and  
over, but you never know,'' Anderson said. ``Who would have thought 
Dan Marino wouldn't have gotten back to the Super Bowl yet. You 
have to take advantage of every opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So, he is. After four years of virtual obscurity in Atlanta --  
few people seem to realize this in his third straight 1,000-yard 
season -- Anderson is finally in his element, a prime-time player. 
You can almost see the dollar signs flashing in his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully ... we'll get more people buying season tickets and  
we'll get more fans coming out and purchasing my jerseys,'' he 
said, rolling his eyes mischievously. ``I really like it, thank you 
very much. Kids, parents, I love it. Grandparents, whoever wants to 
wear it, I appreciate it.''

<HEADLINE> Hacker Given 5 Months in Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A flamboyant computer hacker who claims he  
helped put superhacker Kevin Mitnick behind bars has been sentenced 
to five months in federal prison for violating probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Justin Petersen, 38, was sentenced Tuesday by U.S. District  
Court Judge Stephen Wilson., who warned: ``If you commit another 
crime, you face up to seven, eight, 10 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I suggest you become a little less charming and a little more  
hard-working,'' the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	Petersen, was known for his computer skills as well as his love  
of Los Angeles night life, despite losing his left leg below the 
knee in a motorcycle accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lincoln, Neb., native who called himself ``Agent Steal''  
pleaded guilty in 1993 to federal crimes committed in California 
and Texas, including credit card fraud that involved stealing data 
from a credit information firm. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his sentencing was delayed while he worked as a  
government informant, going to computer conferences at FBI expense 
to spy on other hackers, including Mitnick, the only hacker to make 
the FBI's most wanted list. Mitnick faces an April 20 federal wire 
fraud trial in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Petersen spent 41 months in prison before his release last year.  
But authorities said he violated terms of his supervised release, 
including staying away from computers while not at work, before 
leaving a Los Angeles-area halfway house in August.

<HEADLINE> Man Charged in Nev. Horse Shootings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Police arrested a Reno construction worker  
Tuesday and planned to charge two Marines in California as well in 
the slaughter of 34 wild horses shot to death in Nevada with 
high-powered rifles. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Jon Merlino, 21 was arrested at his work site in  
neighboring Sparks on Tuesday, Washoe County Sheriff Richard 
Kirkland said. 
</P>
<P>
	Merlino was booked into the county jail on charges of grand  
larceny, grand theft and maiming, poisoning or killing another 
person's animal. 
</P>
<P>
	Arrest warrants on the same charges -- which carry combined  
maximum penalties in excess of 10 years in prison -- have been 
issued for the two Marines being held Tuesday night at U.S. Marine 
Corps bases in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Lance Cpl. Scott William Brendle, 22, was being held at Camp  
Pendleton, Calif., and Lance Cpl. Darien Thomas Brock, 21, was 
being held at Twentynine Palms west of Los Angeles, Storey County 
District Attorney Janet Hess said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sad but true,'' said Maj. Lenny Ryan of Camp Pendleton.  
</P>
<P>
	Both are members of the 1st Marine Division. Both were residents  
of the Reno area and home on holiday leave when the free-roaming 
mustangs were shot to death on Dec. 27, Storey County Sheriff Pat 
Whitten said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess said it was not clear if some form of extradition would be  
necessary, but that prosecutors intended to return the soldiers to 
Nevada for prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	Law officers have been investigating the case since the 34  
free-roaming mustangs were shot to death Dec. 27 about 5 miles east 
of the Reno-Sparks area. 
</P>
<P>
	The shootings rocked the local community. Animal protection  
groups helped raise a $35,000 reward for information leading to the 
arrest and conviction of those responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the horses were maimed and at least one was blasted with  
a chemical fire extinguisher on the rugged hillside about one mile 
south of Interstate 80.

	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Party chatter overheard by the granddaughter

<HEADLINE> Court Rules on Voter Initiatives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court limited state regulation of  
voter initiatives Tuesday, striking down as ``excessively 
restrictive of political speech'' several methods Colorado used to 
police such measures. 
</P>
<P>
	``The First Amendment requires us ... to guard against undue  
hindrances to political conversations and the exchange of ideas,'' 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote for the court in a decision that 
provides important new guidelines for other states as well. 
</P>
<P>
	About half the states allow ballot initiatives, and voters  
increasingly are using them to bypass state legislatures and make 
law themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said states may not require:  
</P>
<P>
	--People who circulate petitions to be registered voters.  
</P>
<P>
	--Petition circulators to wear identification badges.  
</P>
<P>
	--Initiative backers to file reports identifying paid petition  
circulators and how much they earned. 
</P>
<P>
	Ginsburg said the requirements ``are not warranted by the state  
interests -- administrative efficiency, fraud detection, informing 
voters -- alleged to justify those restrictions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Acknowledging that ``states allowing ballot initiatives have  
considerable leeway to protect the integrity and reliability of the 
initiative process,'' she said Colorado may, and does, employ other 
methods to serve those purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	All three requirements had been challenged by a group of state  
residents and a public interest group, the American Constitutional 
Law Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a huge victory,'' said William Orr, the foundation's  
executive director. ``The decision basically tells the states and 
the powers that be to keep hands off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vote to strike down the badge-wearing requirement was 8-1,  
with only Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist saying it should be 
upheld. The court split 6-3 in invalidating the other two 
requirements, with Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Stephen G. 
Breyer joining Rehnquist as dissenters. 
</P>
<P>
	Rehnquist noted ballot initiatives were first used nearly 100  
years ago ``as a means of limiting the control of wealthy special 
interests and restoring electoral power to the voters.'' But he 
said in recent years they have been influenced by ``out-of-state 
interests which employ professional firms doing a nationwide 
business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the court's ruling ``strikes down the attempt of a state  
to allow its own voters rather than out-of-state persons and 
political dropouts to decide what issues should go on the ballot to 
be decided by the state's registered voters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Colorado, to get a measure on the ballot supporters must  
collect signatures amounting to at least 5 percent of the total 
votes cast in the most recent race for secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
	After a record 10 initiatives were placed on the state's ballot  
in 1992, the Legislature passed a law that imposed various 
requirements, including the three at issue in Tuesday's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado earlier had banned the use of paid petition  
circulators, but in 1988 the nation's highest court struck down the 
ban, ruling that it interfered too much with ``core political 
speech.''

<HEADLINE> What Polls Say About Clinton Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Some results from polls released Tuesday on President Clinton,  
Congress and the Senate impeachment trial. 

</P>
<P>
	What do you want your senators to do -- vote in favor of  
convicting President Clinton and removing him from office or vote 
against convicting Clinton so he will remain in office? 
</P>
<P>
	Vote for removal -- 32 percent; vote against removal -- 63 percent  
(CNN/USA Today/Gallup). Vote for removal -- 33 percent; vote against 
removal -- 65 percent (ABC News). The number opposed to a vote for 
removal was 68 percent in the CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll in late 
December. 

</P>
<P>
	Do you think the Senate should or should not censure or  
officially reprimand Clinton for his actions in the Monica Lewinsky 
matter? 
</P>
<P>
	Censure -- 57 percent; no censure -- 38 percent (ABC News).  
Censure -- 56 percent; no censure -- 39 percent (CNN/USA 
Today/Gallup). About the same percentage has been in favor of 
censure for the last five months. 

</P>
<P>
	Do you approve or disapprove of the way Bill Clinton is handling  
his job as president? 
</P>
<P>
	Approve -- 62 percent; disapprove -- 36 percent (ABC News).  
Approve -- 67 percent, disapprove -- 30 percent (CNN/USA 
Today/Gallup). Clinton's approval ran as high as 73 percent in some 
polls last month. 

</P>
<P>
	Do you approve or disapprove of the way the Republicans in the  
Senate are handling the impeachment proceedings against Bill 
Clinton? 
</P>
<P>
	Approve -- 36 percent; disapprove -- 54 percent (CNN/USA  
Today/Gallup). In early September, 43 percent approved of the way 
Republicans in Congress were handling the investigation of Clinton 
while 48 percent disapproved. 

</P>
<P>
	After each side presents its case in the trial, do you think the  
Senate should then call witnesses to testify or should the Senate 
complete the trial without calling witnesses to testify? 
</P>
<P>
	Call witnesses -- 41 percent; should not call witnesses -- 55  
percent (ABC News). 

</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll of 1,014 adults has a margin of  
error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. The ABC News poll of 
923 adults has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage 
points. Both polls were taken Friday through Sunday. If numbers 
don't equal 100 percent, the remainder offered no opinion.

fire that killed three young children, one just 3 months old, in an 
unlicensed day care home, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The retired teacher who ran the home was in critical condition  
Tuesday after pulling other children out of her burning home. One 
was in critical condition, while the two others were listed as 
fair. Another was treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
	The teacher, Anita Perkins, disappeared back inside the house to  
get other children during Monday's blaze. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought she had burned up,'' neighbor Donnie Carlton said.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Perkins, 62, was found collapsed near the bodies of the two  
of the children, Fire Department spokesman Steve Huffman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The home's electric clothes dryer was unvented and caught fire  
from a buildup of lint on the heating coils, Huffman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating a day care home without a license could bring a  
misdemeanor charge that includes a fine of up to $1,000 and a year 
in jail. The case was still under investigation, said District 
Attorney John Tyson Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Perkins had a license for five years but gave it up in 1996  
when she planned to start a day care center at a church that would 
be exempt from Department of Human Resources regulations and not 
require a license, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the house was unlicensed, it had not been inspected by the  
Department of Human Resources. The agency checks for smoke 
detectors and fire extinguishers, but clothes dryers are not 
included on the checklist, said department spokeswoman Frances 
Arnold. 
</P>
<P>
	The dead children were identified as 3-month-old Eddie Lee Giles  
III, 2-year-old Aleiah L. Nobles, and 1-year-old Jasmine Sloan.

<HEADLINE> NBA Free Agent Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Like many agents, Herb Rudoy is trying to work  
the phones this week to get an idea of who has interest in his 
free-agent clients. 
</P>
<P>
	But in this week of lockout limbo, Rudoy is finding that offers  
for players like Jason Caffey, Mark Davis and Matt Bullard aren't 
even close to being written in stone. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can only have general discussions, and no one is sure if  
you can actually agree on a deal,'' Rudoy said Monday. ``So you 
couch everything with vague references to whether a player might be 
interested, or what he kind of money he might be looking for. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's so vague, it's like talking in a foreign language.''  
</P>
<P>
	With lawyers for the league and the union still working on  
putting the lockout settlement into written form, Rudoy and other 
agents have found themselves getting caught up in confusion over 
the fine print of the new agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is, there is no fine print.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's total confusion,'' agent Mark Fleischer said. ``I've had  
three GMs tell me they understand certain rules to mean one thing, 
while I've been told the rules are the complete opposite. And these 
are significant things that are in dispute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the settlement terms called for a salary cap of $30  
million for the upcoming season, which was almost $2 million less 
than most teams had been expecting. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, it became apparent that changes in so-called ``cap holds''  
-- rules that determine how unsigned free agents are counted against 
their former teams' salary cap -- would end up hindering player 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
	There also was confusion over whether the new average salary  
exception allows a player to sign a three-year contract or a 
six-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like my college poker games: They're making the rules up  
as they go along,'' agent Keith Glass said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lockout will remain in effect until the agreement is  
finalized, with Jan. 18 set as the target date for opening training 
camps and allowing trades and free agents signings to commence. 
</P>
<P>
	With everyone anxiously awaiting an end to the state of limbo,  
players on Monday were free for the first time in more than six 
months to use team facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a handful showed up at many sites, making scrimmaging  
impossible in some cases. But players were still able to work on 
conditioning drills, lift weights and shoot around. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Knicks' training facility in Purchase, N.Y., Charles  
Oakley's presence gave them just enough bodies to hold a 
five-on-five. Oakley, ironically, played on the same team as Marcus 
Camby -- the player he was traded for on draft night last June. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gave us all fair warning: Don't come down the lane. You  
know Oak's motto,'' said John Starks, who was Oakley's teammate on 
the Knicks for eight seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakley, now a member of the Toronto Raptors, claimed to be in  
perfect shape. The biggest difference was his hair, which was spun 
into mini-dreadlocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tell the Lakers I'm ready. They don't have to worry about me  
being fit,'' said Oakley, who hopes to be traded to a contender 
like Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Coaches were not allowed to work with players Monday, which will  
remain the case until the lockout settlement is finalized. Also, 
the league will not release the new schedule until then. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like a rookie getting drafted and coming into an arena  
for the first time,'' forward Anthony Mason said of walking back 
into Charlotte's training complex for the first time since the 
Hornets were eliminated from the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Charlotte Hornets' workout wasn't scheduled to begin until  
noon, but rookie Ricky Davis showed up at 8:30 a.m. Davis, the 21st 
overall pick in the draft from Iowa, has grown nearly 2 inches 
since the draft and is now 6-foot-7. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little bit taller and a little bit bigger,'' he said.  
``I'm ready to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ten players showed up at the Detroit Pistons' practice facility,  
and coach Alvin Gentry watched the workout through a window in his 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to play by the rules,'' Gentry said. ``I'll be glad  
when the 18th gets here, though, so I can get out there, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grant Hill, who dropped 10-12 pounds and looked slim at 230  
pounds, said the shortened season will make the NBA seem different. 
</P>
<P>
	``With 50 games, it's kind of like college,'' Hill said. ``If  
the No. 1 team loses a game, it will be like they slipped in the 
standings. You sure don't want to start out much below .500. If you 
fall far off, you'll have a hard time catching up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Dallas, Mavericks general manager-coach Don Nelson stood on  
the sidelines as seven of his players scrimmaged with about as many 
free agents. Nelson could only watch, though, as the rules 
prohibited him from barking out orders. 
</P>
<P>
	``For him not to coach when he sees half his team here, I know  
it's frustrating for him -- as frustrating as it was for us to not 
be able to play,'' guard Michael Finley said.

<HEADLINE>  Broncos Have Interchangeable Parts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- When John Elway missed all or parts of six games  
this season with injuries, Bubby Brister came to the rescue, 
keeping the Denver Broncos undefeated. 
</P>
<P>
	When Terrell Davis was dinged or just needed a breather, Derek  
Loville was a capable replacement. At safety, Tyrone Braxton and 
Darrius Johnson have been superb in substitute roles. 
</P>
<P>
	In Saturday's AFC divisional playoff game against Miami, it was  
the offensive line's turn to suffer an injury -- and respond as if 
it never happened. When backup Matt Lepsis was forced into the 
lineup by an injury to left tackle Tony Jones, the Broncos didn't 
miss a beat. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, no matter how many rounds of musical chairs the Broncos  
play with their offensive line, they keep making sweet sounds. 
</P>
<P>
	After Jones limped to the sideline midway through the second  
quarter with a twisted knee, right tackle Harry Swayne switched to 
the left side and Lepsis settled into Swayne's old position. 
</P>
<P>
	To that point, Davis had for 100 yards on 11 carries. After the  
injury, he ran for 99 yards on 10 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis' 199 yards and two touchdowns led the Broncos to a 38-3  
rout of the Dolphins, advancing the Broncos to Sunday's AFC 
championship game against the New York Jets at Mile High Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Such seamless substitution has become a trademark of the line,  
which paved the way for Davis to rush for 1,750 yards in 1997 and 
then, after numerous changes in the preseason, helped orchestrate a 
2,008-yard season for the league's MVP this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought Harry did an exceptional job on the left side,''  
coach Mike Shanahan said. ``Matt did a good job. It wasn't perfect, 
but he really played hard and got the job done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Swayne hadn't worked at left tackle all season. ``It was  
weird,'' he said, ``since everything is backward. At first, I 
couldn't figure out what stance I wanted to get in. I didn't want 
to go the wrong way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teammates gave Lepsis high marks.  
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who is expected to return for Sunday's game, said he  
``didn't have to say anything to Matt -- except `good job.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway said Lepsis ``hasn't had a lot of playing time. But what  
he did was really special, and I told him that after the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lepsis, who played sparingly in four games this season, appeared  
more poised than in those tentative appearances. He was, however, 
still a bit excitable, accidentally decking Loville while 
attempting to offer congratulations after Loville's 11-yard 
touchdown run. Loville's score capped the drive on which Jones was 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really fired up,'' said Lepsis, a tight end at Colorado  
who has bulked up to 290 pounds. ``When I saw Tony go down, I knew 
I had to go in there and not let the team down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The offensive line was widely expected to be the team's  
Achilles' heel as they sought to repeat as Super Bowl champions. 
</P>
<P>
	Pro Bowl left tackle Gary Zimmerman retired, and veteran right  
guard Brian Habib signed a free-agent contract with Seattle. 
Habib's projected replacement, David Diaz-Infante, went down with a 
knee injury in the preseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones switched sides, becoming Zimmerman's replacement at the  
crucial left tackle position that protects Elway's blind side. 
Swayne, a backup in 1997, moved to right tackle, and second-year 
pro Dan Neil became the starting right guard. Only center Tom Nalen 
and left guard Mark Schlereth were in the same positions as in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Most observers felt those were too many changes in a unit that  
demands cohesion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos' offense, however, was even more prolific this year  
than in their Super Bowl season. Besides Davis' improved numbers, 
the offense as a whole gained 6,092 yards, compared to last year's 
5,872, and scored 501 points, compared to 472. Both figures were 
franchise records. The line also allowed only 25 sacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The line has been intact all season, with all five players  
starting every game, even though Schlereth underwent arthroscopic 
knee surgery on Oct. 12 -- the 21st surgery of his career. He had 
the operation prior to a bye week and was back in the starting 
lineup just 13 days after the surgery.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Departure Comes at Bad Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Michael Jordan's retirement couldn't come at a  
worse time for the NBA, which is trying to figure out how to lure 
back fans soured by the nasty six-month lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	The league's No. 1 draw, the most visible and popular athlete in  
the world, won't be around to bail everyone out of this mess. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is sad, but inevitable,'' commissioner David Stern said.  
</P>
<P>
	And now, the basketball will be passed to a new generation, a  
collection of players with neither the charisma and killer 
instinct, nor the records that made Jordan so special. 
</P>
<P>
	The move into the post-Michael era is something the NBA has  
feared and expected. He will be missed, no doubt, but the league 
will move on just as it did after the retirements of so many 
superstars. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, though, everyone in the game must pay tribute to the  
player often known simply as ``MJ.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sad for everyone to see the greatest basketball player in  
the world come to that conclusion,'' said Indiana Pacers coach 
Larry Bird, whose arrival along with Magic Johnson in 1979 began 
the NBA's transformation into a dominant global business. 
</P>
<P>
	``There comes a time in every player's career that they have to  
make that decision, and he feels it's his time,'' added Bird, who 
retired as a player following the 1992 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Filling the void will be impossible for any one player to  
accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the older players, including Karl Malone, Charles  
Barkley, Patrick Ewing and Reggie Miller, never defeated Jordan in 
the playoffs -- and they may never get over it. 
</P>
<P>
	Several younger stars are more known for their most infamous  
moments -- Grant Hill and Penny Hardaway for getting their coaches 
fired, Latrell Sprewell for choking his coach, Allen Iverson for 
his legal troubles, Kobe Bryant for his selfishness -- than for 
great victories. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason that Michael Jordan is acknowledged to be the  
greatest basketball player in the world -- if not in history -- is he 
gets an opportunity to demonstrate that day in and day out over the 
rest of the best basketball players in the world,'' Stern said last 
week when he announced the deal to end the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's how you establish yourself. And the rest of those best  
basketball players in the world ... are prepared to carry on and 
take this league to the heights that we think it's going to 
reach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stern and other league officials wouldn't comment Tuesday, but  
the commissioner is expected to attend Jordan's news conference 
Wednesday at the United Center, the Chicago arena where a bronze 
statue of His Airness stands outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Assuming Jordan confirms his expected retirement, it will bring  
an end to one of the most brilliant careers in league history. 
Without him, many fans just won't tune in any more and his team 
most likely will struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Losers! Losers! Losers!'' Derrick Watt, a 32-year-old Chicago  
machinist and Bulls fan, said he left Michael Jordan's Restaurant 
in Chicago. ``Without Michael, they'll be in the basement of their 
division.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jordan era included six NBA championships, five Most  
Valuable Player awards, 10 scoring titles, 12 All-Star appearances 
and countless other memorable moments -- from last-second shots to 
prolific scoring outbursts -- that epitomized his superiority. 
</P>
<P>
	He also transcended basketball, drawing even non-sports fans to  
watch him on television and in person. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight regular-season Chicago Bulls games on NBC last season  
drew a 6.5 rating on average, while the 17 televised games without 
Jordan got a rating of 3.8 percent, down 71 percent. The four 
most-watched NBA Finals all include Jordan, with last season's 
finals drawing a record 18.7 rating. The two non-Jordan finals in 
'94 and '95 drew a 12.4 and 13.9 rating. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan also drew crowds more than any other player in history,  
selling out all home games and just about all road games. When he 
made what was expected to be his last trip to play in Atlanta last 
March, an NBA record 62,046 fans turned out to see him and the 
Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's the money. Fortune magazine in June estimated that  
Jordan's career financial contribution to the NBA was $10 billion. 
The league generates about $2 billion a year in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sad thing, where basketball is now, Michael Jordan is  
desperately needed. Some fans have probably been lost, and he could 
help bring them back,'' Lakers guard Eddie Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	When Jordan retired for the first time in 1993 and moved on to a  
short-lived professional baseball career, the league publicly said 
many of the same things it has been saying in the months leading up 
to Jordan's re-retirement: That it had survived the departures of 
Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Julius Erving 
and Magic Johnson, and it would survive this, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone agrees.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think there will be a sag,'' said Pulitzer Prize-winning  
author David Halberstam, who followed the Bulls last season for a 
book. ``There are an awful lot of talented players out there, but 
Michael was unusual because he did all this so brilliantly and with 
consummate charm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not all of his linear successors have that charm, and that's  
going to be a problem for the NBA. The public not only wants to see 
great athletes, it wants to like them. It liked Magic, it liked 
Bird, it liked Jordan, but it's not sure if it likes these other 
guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Jordan retired the first time, the league suffered. When he  
returned for a full season in 1995-96, so did the attention of many 
fans. They were riveted when the Bulls won a league-record 72 games 
with one of the greatest teams in history. 
</P>
<P>
	Three more Jordanesque championship series followed, with the  
Bulls beating Seattle in 1996 and Utah in 1997 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps no single moment was more memorable than Jordan stealing  
the ball from Karl Malone in Game 6 in June and dribbling downcourt 
for the jumper that won the title. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, that moment is as unforgettable as it is irreplaceable.  
</P>
<P>
	Just like Jordan.

<HEADLINE> Senate Negotiating Without Map </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The principal players in the unfolding Senate  
impeachment trial drama are feeling their way through a process 
that has few landmarks or road signs. Precedents are being set at 
every awkward turn. 
</P>
<P>
	And every time one question is answered, more seem to be raised.  
</P>
<P>
	For instance, if senators are considered as jurors and commanded  
to silence on the Senate floor ``on pain of imprisonment,'' should 
they be holding news conferences on the side or making the rounds 
of TV interview shows? 
</P>
<P>
	And what about reading newspapers and following broadcast news?  
Jurors in major trials are usually sequestered and kept away from 
news reports that might influence them. 
</P>
<P>
	And should they deliberate privately, as juries do normally; or  
publicly, as the Senate does when it considers legislation, 
treaties and nominations? 
</P>
<P>
	And what about that ``pain of imprisonment'' thing? Would a  
senator really be locked up for speaking out during the trial? 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a strange process, one that we are not familiar with,  
in terms of making a case,'' says House Judiciary Committee 
Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., President Clinton's chief prosecutor 
in the first presidential impeachment trial in 131 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, who decided to wear a  
distinctive gold-stripe robe of his own design to preside, seems a 
bit uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking the gavel Friday after the two parties reached accord on  
rules for the trial, Rehnquist moved quickly to order a vote on the 
resolution embodying those rules, presented by Senate Majority 
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	Too quickly, it seemed.  
</P>
<P>
	No sooner had Rehnquist ordered up ``the yeas and nays,'' than  
Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va. -- a master of process and stickler for 
procedure -- was on his feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Could the clerk read the resolution for the edification of the  
Senate at this time?'' Byrd asked, gently guiding Rehnquist. The 
chief justice told the clerk to read. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd himself has warned that the Senate is ``teetering on the  
brink'' of ``the black pit of partisan self-indulgence,'' one he 
suggests has already swallowed the House. Proceed cautiously, Byrd 
warns. 
</P>
<P>
	As to senators-as-jurors, Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, says  
``nonsense'': ``I have gone to great pains over the last weeks to 
try to inform and advise people that we are not a jury sitting in a 
criminal case or civil case in a court of law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harkin and Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., want to require that  
all deliberations be public. ``In short, a debate that affects 
every single person in this country may be cloaked in secrecy,'' 
Harkin said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Senate were really a jury, ``we wouldn't be here talking  
with you,'' Wellstone said at a news conference. ``This is a 
judicial process but it's also a political process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate is known more for its convolution of rules, ones that  
allow individual senators to put anonymous death-grip ``holds'' on 
presidential nominees and small minorities to hamstring all 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have very good and clever lawyers. I'm sure they could have  
come up with 15 or 20 constitutional arguments that could have tied 
this process up for weeks and months,'' said Clinton spokesman Joe 
Lockhart. ``But we think that this should move forward 
expeditiously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From the chief justice down, everyone is taking the process very  
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	``This building is a hallowed place, a temple to the rule of  
law,'' Lott said in a GOP radio address. ``Believe me, to sit in 
judgment here is to feel a responsibility far heavier than any 
other political concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's the issue of witnesses -- a subject the Senate won't  
decide for another few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	In the real world, Clinton would ``be looking at some 55 years  
in federal prison for what he's charged with, with perjury and 
obstruction,'' claimed Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif. ``If he really is 
innocent, he should come down to the Senate, he should testify, he 
should present his case, and he should bring his friends and his 
buddies and his employees down to do the very same thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Which brings up another question for which there is no  
precedent. 
</P>
<P>
	If Clinton is acquitted by the Senate, but later tried as a  
citizen by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, convicted and sent to 
federal prison -- would his Secret Service detail have to go to jail 
with him? 
</P>
<P>
	``The Constitution gives the Senate this solemn duty. However,  
it does not give us a clear roadmap on how to proceed,'' summed up 
Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Retirement Hurts Young Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- For 11-year-old Anthony Heredal, being ``like  
Mike'' is more than an advertising slogan -- it's a way of life. 
</P>
<P>
	Heredal spends his time after school on the court, mimicking  
Michael Jordan's moves. He's even trying to master the tongue-wag 
that used to be a sure sign that his hero was on the move. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan hero-worship is a rite of passage for many of Chicago's  
youth. And the news of his expected retirement today was 
devastating. 
</P>
<P>
	It ``feels like the game is ruined,'' said Heredal, who met some  
friends after school at this North Side YMCA on Tuesday to play the 
game they love best. 
</P>
<P>
	Kids like Heredal see Jordan as the best there's ever been and  
everything they aspire to be. They watch every game, hang on every 
word, follow the changing styles of the Air Jordan sneaker, buy his 
books and his No. 23 jerseys. 
</P>
<P>
	They imitate the way Jordan drives the ball, the way he defies  
gravity with his jumps shots and the way he rolls his fingers, 
flipping the ball in the hoop with such easy grace. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has all the right game,'' said Terrence Webb, 16. ``He  
can't be stopped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Webb said there's only one thing left for the Chicago Bulls:  
Rebuild the whole program. Without Jordan, he said the whole team 
falls like a stack of cards. Bye, Jordan. Bye, Pippen. Bye, Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a crummy season,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	But no one seemed more depressed about the coming season than  
10-year-old Anthony Williams, who came to watch his friends from 
the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hurts me, man,'' he said, shaking his head. Williams hopes  
he, too, can be a guard for the NBA someday, just like Mike. 
Without MJ, he said, the game ``ain't gonna have the same action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody likes Jordan,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Not so, interjected 11-year-old Trevor Dale, who proclaimed,  
``Scottie Pippen's the man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams wasn't about to let his hero get slammed. But his  
defense of Jordan already was in the past tense. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan ``was MVP. He rebounded. He scored points for the team.  
He was good. THAT man was GOOD,'' he said in defiance. 
</P>
<P>
	Montel Gest, 14, jumped in to agree.  
</P>
<P>
	``Michael Jordan was the only one who'd step up and take  
charge,'' Gest said, calling the rest of the Bulls ``followers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gest said the debate about who's the best player can get heated  
at these after-school pickup games. In the past, he said, players 
have almost come to blows over whether His Airness really is the 
greatest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of them love him, some of them hate him,'' he said with a  
shrug as he threw the ball back in-bounds. 
</P>
<P>
	But Williams, after conceding that Pippen is pretty good, too,  
said there's one player whose absence will really make a difference 
to these NBA hopefuls. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're gonna miss Jordan,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Broncos Have Interchangeable Parts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- When John Elway missed all or parts of six games  
this season with injuries, Bubby Brister came to the rescue, 
keeping the Denver Broncos undefeated. 
</P>
<P>
	When Terrell Davis was dinged or just needed a breather, Derek  
Loville was a capable replacement. At safety, Tyrone Braxton and 
Darrius Johnson have been superb in substitute roles. 
</P>
<P>
	In Saturday's AFC divisional playoff game against Miami, it was  
the offensive line's turn to suffer an injury -- and respond as if 
it never happened. When backup Matt Lepsis was forced into the 
lineup by an injury to left tackle Tony Jones, the Broncos didn't 
miss a beat. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, no matter how many rounds of musical chairs the Broncos  
play with their offensive line, they keep making sweet sounds. 
</P>
<P>
	After Jones limped to the sideline midway through the second  
quarter with a twisted knee, right tackle Harry Swayne switched to 
the left side and Lepsis settled into Swayne's old position. 
</P>
<P>
	To that point, Davis had for 100 yards on 11 carries. After the  
injury, he ran for 99 yards on 10 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis' 199 yards and two touchdowns led the Broncos to a 38-3  
rout of the Dolphins, advancing the Broncos to Sunday's AFC 
championship game against the New York Jets at Mile High Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Such seamless substitution has become a trademark of the line,  
which paved the way for Davis to rush for 1,750 yards in 1997 and 
then, after numerous changes in the preseason, helped orchestrate a 
2,008-yard season for the league's MVP this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought Harry did an exceptional job on the left side,''  
coach Mike Shanahan said. ``Matt did a good job. It wasn't perfect, 
but he really played hard and got the job done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Swayne hadn't worked at left tackle all season. ``It was  
weird,'' he said, ``since everything is backward. At first, I 
couldn't figure out what stance I wanted to get in. I didn't want 
to go the wrong way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teammates gave Lepsis high marks.  
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who is expected to return for Sunday's game, said he  
``didn't have to say anything to Matt -- except `good job.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway said Lepsis ``hasn't had a lot of playing time. But what  
he did was really special, and I told him that after the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lepsis, who played sparingly in four games this season, appeared  
more poised than in those tentative appearances. He was, however, 
still a bit excitable, accidentally decking Loville while 
attempting to offer congratulations after Loville's 11-yard 
touchdown run. Loville's score capped the drive on which Jones was 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really fired up,'' said Lepsis, a tight end at Colorado  
who has bulked up to 290 pounds. ``When I saw Tony go down, I knew 
I had to go in there and not let the team down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The offensive line was widely expected to be the team's  
Achilles' heel as they sought to repeat as Super Bowl champions. 
</P>
<P>
	Pro Bowl left tackle Gary Zimmerman retired, and veteran right  
guard Brian Habib signed a free-agent contract with Seattle. 
Habib's projected replacement, David Diaz-Infante, went down with a 
knee injury in the preseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones switched sides, becoming Zimmerman's replacement at the  
crucial left tackle position that protects Elway's blind side. 
Swayne, a backup in 1997, moved to right tackle, and second-year 
pro Dan Neil became the starting right guard. Only center Tom Nalen 
and left guard Mark Schlereth were in the same positions as in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Most observers felt those were too many changes in a unit that  
demands cohesion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos' offense, however, was even more prolific this year  
than in their Super Bowl season. Besides Davis' improved numbers, 
the offense as a whole gained 6,092 yards, compared to last year's 
5,872, and scored 501 points, compared to 472. Both figures were 
franchise records. The line also allowed only 25 sacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The line has been intact all season, with all five players  
starting every game, even though Schlereth underwent arthroscopic 
knee surgery on Oct. 12 -- the 21st surgery of his career. He had 
the operation prior to a bye week and was back in the starting 
lineup just 13 days after the surgery.

<HEADLINE> Cholesterol Drug Works for Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Boys born with a cholesterol disorder that  
virtually dooms them to heart disease can benefit from taking a 
cholesterol-lowering drug that is widely used among adults, a new 
study indicates. 
</P>
<P>
	In the yearlong study, the drug lovastatin significantly lowered  
inherited high cholesterol among the boys ages 10 to 17. The 
genetically caused disorder, which affects about 500,000 Americans, 
cannot be controlled by diet. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug, introduced in 1987 and sold under the name Mevacor,  
caused no harm to boys' growth or sexual development, which can be 
a concern when adult drugs are used to treat children, researchers 
said in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	While other studies have indicated the effectiveness of  
lovastatin on children, the new study is the longest and largest to 
date. 
</P>
<P>
	Lovastatin and five other similar cholesterol-lowering drugs in  
the same family are being used to treat children with inherited 
high cholesterol, but doctors have had scant research in children 
to back up the practice, said the lead author, Dr. Evan A. Stein of 
the Metabolic and Atherosclerosis Research Center in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	Without treatment, 23 percent of boys with inherited high  
cholesterol will die of heart disease by age 50, he and his 
colleagues noted, citing previous research. Girls also can have 
inherited high cholesterol, and it greatly increases their risk of 
early heart disease, although less than in boys. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, which involved 132 boys, those who took lovastatin  
saw significant decreases in their cholesterol. Trials of 
cholesterol-lowering drugs on adults have clearly shown a reduction 
in heart disease corresponding to lowered cholesterol, and 
presumably the boys will reap the same benefit when they grow 
older, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The boys had an average of more than twice the normal level of  
so-called ``bad'' cholesterol, or LDL cholesterol, in their blood, 
Stein said. Those levels declined by 17 percent, 24 percent and 27 
percent in the boys receiving daily dosages of 10, 20 and 40 
milligrams of lovastatin, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	No significant differences were found between boys taking  
lovastatin and those taking a placebo in rates of growth and sexual 
maturation, which included extensive hormone tests and measurement 
of testicular growth, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute led by  
Dr. Basil M. Rifkind, said the study is valuable and important but 
more research is needed to determine if cholesterol-lowering drugs 
will be safe over a lifetime when people start taking them in 
youth. 
</P>
<P>
	Mevacor is marketed by Merck &AMP; Co. Inc., which helped fund the  
study.

<HEADLINE> Farm Analysts See No Price Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Corn and soybean farmers had bumper crops in  
1998, but the loss of overseas markets and low prices brought 
economic trouble to many farm communities. Some analysts say next 
year will likely bring more of the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got very large supplies but lackluster demand,'' said  
Mike Singer, an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. 
``I think it would almost take some sort of weather problem that 
cuts production to really give a big boost to prices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat farmers have already responded to last year's record low  
prices by planting less of their winter wheat crop this year -- 
making it the smallest wheat crop since 1972, the Agriculture 
Department said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The peek at this year's crops came as USDA released its 1998  
crop figures. In many cases, like soybeans and corn, farmers had 
bumper production years. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean production for 1998 totaled 2.76 billion bushels, the  
highest on record. Last year's figures are 3 percent higher than 
1997, which had set a record with 2.69 billion bushels. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn also had a good year, with production estimated at 9.76  
billion bushels, up 6 percent from the 1997 crop. Last year's corn 
crop ranks second behind the record 10.1 billion bushels produced 
in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat production for 1998 is estimated at 2.55 billion, 3  
percent higher than the previous year but down from earlier 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, those successes were overshadowed by prices so low  
Congress stepped in late last year and passed a $7 billion 
emergency aid package. 
</P>
<P>
	Other crops, like cotton, were hit with a double whammy in 1998  
-- low prices and low production. 
</P>
<P>
	Cotton production in 1998 was 13.7 million bales, compared with  
18.7 million the previous year. A drought followed by severe storms 
took its toll on cotton, analysts said. The prospect doesn't 
improve for 1999 either. 
</P>
<P>
	``The outlook for price in 1999 is rather bleak,'' said Carl  
Anderson, an agricultural economist at Texas A&AMP;M University who 
specializes in cotton. ``We're just not competitive in 
international markets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cotton, which had been getting about 60 cents a pound last  
month, is expected to drop to around 57 cents and maybe even lower 
this year, Anderson said. It costs at least 65 cents a pound to 
produce cotton. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market price is not meeting their cost of production for  
'99,'' Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the case of wheat, experts say -- despite the federal aid --  
many farmers are changing crops this year in hopes of regaining 
some financial footing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just driving around Kansas it was obvious there are a lot of  
fields that weren't being planted,'' said Rollie Sears, a wheat 
breeder at Kansas State University. ``Acreage has been going down 
the last three to five years. I expect that trend to continue as 
long as the prices of wheat are depressed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The planted area for the 1999 winter wheat crop is 43.3 million  
acres, a 7 percent decrease, according to the USDA. Farmers in such 
states as Kansas, Illinois and Iowa all reduced their crops this 
year, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, wheat farmers who had gotten $3.38 and $4.30 in the  
1996 and 1997 seasons saw prices at around $2.55 a bushel in 1998 -- 
the lowest in 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Farm attitude is pretty low,'' said Sears. ``It's amazing to  
me how anybody can even stay in business.''

<HEADLINE> Met Presents a Baritone `Werther' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Based on his performance at the Metropolitan  
Opera, there's no doubt that Thomas Hampson was born to sing 
Werther. But Hampson is a baritone, and ``Werther'' is an opera for 
a tenor. 
</P>
<P>
	During a recital tour in Italy, baritone Dale Duesing found a  
long-lost baritone ``Werther.'' In Padua, he was shown a score 
where Massenet rewrote the romantic title part for baritone Mattia 
Battistini. Duesing sang the musically lush opera in Seattle, in 
1989. On Monday, Hampson become the third baritone Werther. 
</P>
<P>
	The plot adapts Goethe's novel ``The Sorrows of Young Werther.''  
In the opera, Werther, a poet visiting the countryside, is assigned 
to escort Charlotte, the daughter of an estate manager, to a ball. 
Charlotte, tender caretaker of seven siblings after her mother's 
death, has a fiance away on business. Werther and Charlotte fall 
instantly in love. But she had promised her mother that she would 
marry her fiance Albert -- and she does. 
</P>
<P>
	Hampson's Met performance proved this adaptation for baritones  
is no mere novelty. He is elegant, in voice and acting. As 
Charlotte, Susan Graham combines gentleness and emotion. 
</P>
<P>
	The singing and acting must convince an audience that they have  
a great and noble love, and Hampson and Graham do that. The tragedy 
is real. Charlotte realizes too late -- after she marries -- just how 
deep their love is. Hampson emphasizes not Werther's youth but his 
deep pain and refinement. 
</P>
<P>
	In just one telling moment, in Act 2, Werther stands, back to  
the audience, as Charlotte walks away from him -- possibly forever. 
His shoulders don't slump; he's in shock. His death scene was 
deeply moving. 
</P>
<P>
	A tenor Werther offers ringing high notes that thrill with  
emotion. A baritone Werther projects profound emotion. The 
preference, of course, rests with the listener. 
</P>
<P>
	The Met Opera staged the American premiere of ``Werther'' in  
1894, on tour in Chicago. Jean de Reszke sang the title role there 
and later in New York and London. Though Massenet approved, he 
rewrote the part in 1902 for Battistini, the famous Italian 
baritone. The new version does not transpose the tenor part down; 
Massenet re-wrote the part, but did not change any other vocal or 
orchestral music. And he did not publish the score. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is believed that baritones who followed Battistini didn't  
sing ``Werther'' because they chose not to follow his high-profile 
activities. Antonio de Almeida drew on his collection of rare opera 
scores for the Seattle Opera's performance that he conducted. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Runnicles conducted at the Met. Rebecca Evans made her  
Met debut as Sophie, Charlotte's teen-age sister. She sang with a 
bright tone, making much of Sophie's gaiety. Though she intended to 
cheer Werther, she actually had the opposite effect on his bruised 
spirit. Wisely, Evans did not portray Sophie with a crush. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher Robertson sang Charlotte's husband. Though Albert's  
words portray him as understanding, even sympathetic, Robertson's 
dry voice turned Albert into a dry stick who can inspire only duty, 
not love.

<HEADLINE> Ratings Will Suffer Without Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	As if restoring the image of the NBA following the six-month  
lockout wasn't enough, NBC and Turner Sports now face the difficult 
challenge of finding a new ``poster boy'' to take Michael Jordan's 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	No player has been able to boost TV ratings the way Jordan has  
in recent years. His Bulls were involved in the five most watched 
games in NBA history. Last season's Game 6 of the NBA Finals 
against Utah was seen in a record 21.9 million homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have all been fortunate to have been a part of one of the  
most magical rides in sports history,'' NBC sports chairman Dick 
Ebersol said. ``Now, with the NBA and the other television 
partners, we have to reintroduce the new generation of stars in the 
NBA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No NBA player is in the wings to replace Jordan. There might  
never be another athlete able to lure viewers as the Bulls star has 
done. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's eight regular season games on NBC posted a 6.5 rating  
last year. The 17 games without Michael were down 71 percent, for a 
3.8 rating. 
</P>
<P>
	His impact was even bigger in the postseason.  
</P>
<P>
	Last year's finals drew a record 18.7 rating. The two non-Jordan  
finals in '94 and '95 drew a 12.4 and 13.9 rating. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a question of when they will recover,'' said Neal  
Pilson, the former president of CBS Sports who now runs a 
consulting firm. ``The NBA will survive his retirement, but there 
will definitely be a ratings decline from all of this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The networks, with the help of the league, are expected to  
soften the blow by relying on a core of young players that includes 
Lakers Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, San Antonio's Tim Duncan 
and Detroit's Grant Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anyone's ready to take the baton,'' said TNT  
analyst and former player Doc Rivers. ``Michael is the Babe Ruth, 
and that's the truth. If we're waiting for one guy, we're going to 
be waiting for a long, long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One difficulty in finding someone that the country can fall in  
love with is that the player must not only have talent, but also 
play on a winner and in a major media market city. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivers said two candidates stick out in his mind: Shaq and  
Duncan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both of them have a realistic chance to win a title this  
year,'' he said. ``Kobe has to be proven. He's a heck of a talent, 
but not yet a heck of a basketball player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Pacers player Clark Kellogg agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I love Grant's game and personality, but to try and force  
Michael's role on him is unrealistic,'' said Kellogg, now a 
broadcaster for CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	The networks knew this day was coming. The only question was  
when. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is that we expected that Michael would retire at some  
point during our TV contract,'' said Dr. Harvey Schiller, Turner 
Sports president. ``I may have a naive view, but my expectation is 
that Bulls games will go down in ratings, but that other games will 
go up.''

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Two passenger trains collided  
head-on in a Rio de Janeiro suburb on Tuesday, killing at least six 
people and injuring more than 20, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident happened near the suburb of Pilares on the  
outskirts of Rio. The likely cause was faulty signals, according to 
Ronaldo Coutinho, one of the directors of the private train 
company, Supervia, that owns the trains. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the company nor rescue officials knew how many  
passengers were on board.

	Globo TV showed firemen searching through the twisted wreckage  
of the two partially derailed trains.

	SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Chile's ambassador to London will return  
to his post one month after being called home to protest Britain's 
arrest of former dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza said the government decided  
ambassador Mario Artaza's presence in London was necessary as the 
House of Lords prepares to issue a second and final ruling on 
whether Pinochet has diplomatic immunity. 
</P>
<P>
	Chile's government wants to make a statement at the hearing,  
scheduled for Jan. 18, that no foreign court has jurisdiction over 
alleged crimes committed in Chile by a Chilean national. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet, 83, was arrested Oct. 16 in London on a warrant from  
Spain, which wants to extradite him and try him on charges of 
genocide and torture.

	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Coast Guard pilots searched Tuesday  
for three seamen thrown from a fuel tanker by an explosion that 
killed two men and injured another three. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosion aboard the 500-foot Athenean Fidelity occurred  
Monday in international waters about 70 miles south of Saona Island 
in the Dominican Republic, Coast Guard spokesman Dave Silva said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cyprus-registered ship was on its way from New York to  
Venezuela, Silva said. 
</P>
<P>
	The blast in one of the ship's empty center tanks ripped open  
the deck but caused no damage to the hull, Silva said. No fuel or 
oil was spilled, he added.

	SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) -- El Salvador will sell off its  
remaining 39 percent share of the state telephone company, hoping 
to net an estimated $151.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Economy Minister Eduardo Zablah told reporters on Tuesday that  
25 percent of the company's shares will be offered on the stock 
exchange and the other 14 percent to telephone service subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	The sell-off will complete privatization of the government's  
telecommunications Company. 
</P>
<P>
	Around 10 percent of the stock was sold earlier to telephone  
company employees and 51 percent July 24 to France Telecom, which 
will be the operator of the system.

<HEADLINE> Conn. Gov. OKs Patriots' Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Gov. John Rowland on Tuesday signed  
legislation that will pay for a $374 million Hartford stadium for 
the New England Patriots, a project intended to spark a downtown 
revitalization. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill-signing ceremony in the Old State House was packed with  
supporters of the project, but several opponents turned out as 
well. One, a retired Hartford public school teacher, was rebuffed 
by Rowland and ushered out of the room when she tried to address 
the governor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's necessary for the people to speak,'' Mary Lyons, a member  
of the Stop the Stadium Coalition, said later. ``My main concern is 
that the government is not taking care of the problems of the state 
and is spending millions of dollars on a football stadium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Join us,'' Rowland said to those opposing the project. ``You  
don't have to like it, but at least be part of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation sailed through the General Assembly on Dec. 15.  
But the plan must still clear a few more hurdles. Patriots owner 
Robert Kraft must sign a development agreement with the state, and 
the NFL club owners must approve the team's relocation.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers Sign Cadaret, Trade Hall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Dodgers have signed  
left-handed reliever Greg Cadaret to a one-year contract and made 
room for him on the 40-man roster by trading right-handed reliever 
Darren Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Cadaret, 36, was 1-2 with one save and a 4.32 ERA in 50 games  
for the Anaheim Angels and Texas Rangers last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Cadaret has a 38-32 lifetime record with a 3.99 ERA and 14 saves  
in 10 big-league seasons. He has also pitched for Oakland, the New 
York Yankees, Cincinnati, Kansas City, Toronto and Detroit as well 
as Anaheim and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Greg is a quality veteran left-handed reliever with experience  
that will help strengthen and modify our bullpen,'' Dodgers general 
manager Kevin Malone said. ``The addition of Greg gives (manager) 
Davey Johnson another option late in the game to help us win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers traded Hall to the Chicago White Sox in exchange for  
minor-league catcher Joe Sutton. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall, 34, was limited to 11 relief appearances for the Dodgers  
last season due to a tear in his right rotator cuff. He was 0-3 
with a 10.32 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Sutton, 24, hit .231 with four homers and 22 RBIs in 76 games  
for Class A Hickory in the White Sox organization.

<HEADLINE> World-Famous Concert Hall To Expand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The world's most famous concert hall is about to  
get a little bigger and a little more modern. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnegie Hall will add a third, high-tech performance space in  
the building's basement in time for the 2001-2002 season, officials 
announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The new space, to be located directly under the main stage, will  
seat up to 640 people for artistic and educational programs and 
include equipment for video transmissions and live 
teleconferencing. 
</P>
<P>
	``With this project we are pushing the envelope of our greatest  
dreams for the future,'' violinist Issac Stern, the president of 
Carnegie Hall, said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction on the $50 million project is to start this summer.  
</P>
<P>
	So far, $40 million has been raised, including about $12 million  
from the city and $2 million from the state. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest has been raised privately, including a $10 million  
donation from Arthur and Judy Zankel, the largest gift in Carnegie 
Hall history. The new third stage is to be named in their honor. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnegie Hall, built by steel magnate Andrew Carnegie in 1891,  
has served as the place where some of the greatest musicians of the 
20th Century have come to play before a discerning public. 
</P>
<P>
	While it is best known as the home-away-from-home of such  
classical music icons as Maria Callas, Luciano Pavarotti and 
Vladimir Horowitz, Carnegie Hall has also played host to Charlie 
Parker, Ella Fitzgerald, Frank Sinatra, Billie Holiday, the Beatles 
and Bruce Springsteen. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite its legacy, the building in midtown Manhattan was slated  
for demolition in 1960, when there were plans to replace it with an 
office tower. Stern led a coalition of musicians and civic leaders 
to save the building, which was purchased by the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnegie Hall's main auditorium -- known for the sterling quality  
of its acoustics (although some say it has lost something since a 
1986 renovation) -- seats 2,804 and a second space, Weill Recital 
Hall, seats 268.

<HEADLINE> IOC Exec Meets With Coke Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- An IOC executive rushed to Atlanta Tuesday to  
reassure executives of Coca-Cola Co., and other Olympic sponsors 
not to panic over the Salt Lake City bribery crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Payne, the IOC's top marketing officer, set a meeting  
Tuesday evening with Coca-Cola officials to tell them action would 
be taken against corrupt committee members, and has Wednesday 
sessions scheduled at the Atlanta headquarters of United Parcel 
Service and The Home Depot. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne huddled Monday in New York with officials of the IOC's  
newly retained public relations firm, Hill &AMP; Knowlton, before 
beginning a series of meetings with Olympic sponsors about the 
allegations of corruption in the awarding of the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate sponsors provide crucial support to the games. One, U  
S West, has said it will hold up a $5 million sponsorship payment 
due at the end of this month because of concern over the corruption 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke, an Olympic sponsor since 1928 that is closely identified  
with the games, emphasized Tuesday that it remains committed to 
supporting the Olympics -- assuming the International Olympic 
Committee corrective action. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe in the Olympic movement. We're concerned about  
anything that can negatively impact the Olympics,'' said Coke 
spokesman Ben Deutsch. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've expressed our concerns to the IOC, U.S. Olympic  
Committee and the Salt Lake City organizing committee and have been 
assured that they will take swift action to bring this situation to 
a positive closure,'' he said, adding that the committees' initial 
responses have been encouraging. He said the company has been in 
regular contact with Olympic officials about the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very confident that they are taking the right steps,''  
Deutsch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke has already contracted to sponsor both the Summer and  
Winter Games through 2008. Home Depot, a sponsor for the first time 
for the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta, has also signed on for the 
Salt Lake City games as a U.S. sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	UPS, however, hasn't decided whether to extend its Olympic  
sponsorship past the 2000 Games in Sydney. Spokeswoman Susan 
Rosenberg said UPS had planned even before the scandal broke to 
make a decision sometime this year on a Salt Lake City sponsorship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would think it would be a factor in the discussion, but I  
think it's premature to say what factor,'' she said. ``We really 
look at it from the standpoint of the Olympic brand. We think it's 
a strong brand and it can sustain a hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said UPS wants to see action not only to clean up the Salt  
Lake City mess but to prevent a repeat with future games. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC has said it will release a report on the allegations  
Jan. 24. Besides the Olympic bodies' probes, the Justice Department 
is investigating the allegations that cash payments of as much as 
$70,000 were given to IOC members along with other gifts and 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Former officials of the Atlanta Olympics have sharply denied  
that there was any bribery involved in gaining the 1996 games for 
the city.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Push Plan for Disabled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will ask for $1.2 billion  
over five years to help tens of thousands of disabled Americans 
return to work by making it easier for them to keep their health 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement will cap years of effort by the disability  
community and members of Congress to encourage people with 
disabilities to go to work. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 1 barrier, advocates say, is the loss of the health  
coverage that is so important to people suffering from conditions 
that require extensive medical care. Often, people with 
disabilities find jobs that do not offer health insurance, and 
often their disabilities make it extraordinarily expensive to buy 
coverage on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was to announce the proposal Wednesday. It's the latest  
in a series of events previewing the budget he will submit to 
Congress next month, as he tries to focus attention on policy 
during his impeachment trial in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton plans to endorse legislation being introduced next week  
by Sens. James Jeffords, R-Vt., and Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., 
congressional sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The threat of losing federal health benefits is a powerful  
disincentive which prevents disabled people who want to work from 
entering the work force,'' Jeffords and Kennedy said in a statement 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The president will also back a plan that would let people with  
disabilities choose their rehabilitation center, creating 
competition for the first time for the organizations that train 
people to take jobs. Centers that successfully place people in jobs 
would get bonus payments, thus reaping some of the savings the 
government will realize from reduced disability payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the current system, less than one-half of 1 percent of the  
10 million Americans receiving disability benefits ever return to 
work, including people in the Social Security system for workers 
and the Supplemental Security Income program for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Their advocates argue that's because the system punishes them  
when they go to work -- forcing them to choose between health 
benefits and a job. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're taking the biggest programs, the most money we're  
spending and reorienting them in a way that promotes work,'' said 
Andrew Imparato of the National Council on Disability. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan would encourage states to offer Medicaid to people who  
return to work, allowing them to buy into the program even if their 
incomes are too high under current limits. States could also let 
people buy into Medicaid even if their conditions have improved but 
they remain impaired and need health coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan would also allow people with disabilities to continue  
receiving Medicare benefits, which are not as generous as state 
benefits but would be available to people across the nation, 
regardless of a state's policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also was announcing support for other, smaller  
initiatives to aid people with disabilities, but White House 
officials refused to discuss them until Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation being offered by Jeffords, chairman of the  
Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, and Kennedy, the 
panel's top Democrat, would also create a demonstration project to 
test the effect of phasing out benefits as people earn more. 
</P>
<P>
	Under current law, disability beneficiaries lose their entire  
grants if they earn more than $500 a month, prompting some to turn 
down raises or limit their hours.

<HEADLINE> Tuggle Finally Proud of Falcons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- Finally, the Atlanta Falcons have put  
together a team that's worthy of playing alongside Jessie Tuggle. 
</P>
<P>
	For more than a decade, Tuggle has been a tackling machine and  
symbol of dignity for the Falcons, but it's hard to get noticed 
when your franchise is a laughingstock. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a guy who went into the Hall of Fame last year named  
Mike Singletary,'' former Falcons linebacker Tommy Nobis said. ``I 
would take Jessie Tuggle over Mike Singletary. I've watched this 
guy. I know what he is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's one major difference, though. Singletary performed the  
``Super Bowl Shuffle'' for the Chicago Bears; Tuggle's 12-year 
career has been spent with a sad song known as the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Singletary played with a lot of emotion and was a good player,  
but he was also in a market that won and he got the recognition,'' 
said Nobis, now an executive in the Falcons front office. ``We've 
got one of the best middle linebackers who ever played the game ... 
but he's not considered one of the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuggle has not been totally overlooked, earning enough respect  
from his peers to be voted to the Pro Bowl five times, including 
this season. Still, he knows that his career has been hampered by 
the team around him. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons had a winning record only twice in Tuggle's first 11  
seasons before going 15-2 this season, winning the NFC West and 
advancing to the conference championship game for the first time. 
They meet Minnesota Sunday for a trip to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the year I'm most proud of,'' Tuggle said. ``It's a  
year we broke a lot of franchise records. It's a year that not only 
myself, but a lot of my teammates, got recognized as Pro Bowl 
players. It's a year we won, we established ourselves in the NFL 
and made people respect us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuggle went through a similar struggle early in his career.  
</P>
<P>
	An undrafted free agent from tiny Valdosta State, he needed  
three seasons to become a full-time starter, but by 1990 he was 
leading the NFL in tackles. The following year, he did even better 
with a career-high 207 stops, again leading the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither season was he selected for the Pro Bowl.  
</P>
<P>
	``Over my career, it hurt me a lot (playing for the Falcons),  
kept me from being recognized as an All-Pro player,'' Tuggle said. 
``I had some great seasons ... some awesome seasons, that I didn't 
get recognized for. 
</P>
<P>
	``This league is all about recognizing the winners. It's tough  
to single each and every individual out. There are other guys out 
there who might have a story like my story. At the same time, you 
can't get tied up in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuggle, 33, appeared to be slowing the last couple of seasons.  
Perhaps he was worn down by all those hits -- he is the NFL's active 
leading tackler with 1,902 -- or maybe he was just tired of losing. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, Tuggle managed only 113 tackles, the lowest total  
since his rookie season. He didn't lead the team in tackles for the 
first time since 1988. His aging legs are no longer fast enough to 
keep him on the field in obvious passing situations. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking beyond the numbers, however, most observers -- players,  
coaches and those who follow the team on a regular basis -- feel 
he's playing better than he has in years. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuggle agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think my game is more physical,'' he said. ``The quickness  
is there. The endurance is there. I'm able to read and recognize 
plays a lot quicker and a lot faster. That gives me the ability to 
make plays that some linebackers can't make.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuggle's knack of getting to the ball-carrier is uncanny.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how you get in there and bust somebody in the  
mouth that quickly while slipping a guard,'' safety Eugene Robinson 
said. ``That's a knack. You can't teach that. You can't go to a 
player in college and say, `OK, I want you to read this, slide 
underneath a guy, then square back up and smack somebody at full 
speed.' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how Jessie does it, but he does.''

<HEADLINE> IOC Member Denies Wrongdoing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- An IOC member from Finland denied any  
wrongdoing in connection with reports Tuesday that her ex-husband 
had worked for Salt Lake City's Olympic bid committee, and said she 
had no intention of resigning. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my opinion I have not at any time done anything contrary to  
the IOC rules,'' International Olympic Committee member Pirjo 
Haeggman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times reported that Haeggman's former husband  
worked briefly for the bid committee that won the right to stage 
the 2002 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper quoted unidentified Olympic officials as saying her  
husband was hired to do an environmental study for the bid 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The report came as investigations continued into allegations  
that IOC members received scholarships, cash, lavish gifts and 
other favors from Salt Lake organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This came as a big surprise for me,'' Haeggman said at a news  
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	She said her ex-husband Bjarne, an unemployed forest technician,  
``desperately had looked for a job for two years, home or abroad,'' 
but that at the time of the reported work in 1993 they were 
splitting up. The couple divorced in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if he got any fees or a salary, and from where,''  
the IOC member said. ``After I moved, I had my separate bank 
account, and cannot tell if anything was paid to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Finnish IOC member said she knew that her husband held  
discussions with David Johnson, then vice president for the Salt 
Lake bid committee, and that a company, Great Basin Engineering, 
was involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``My husband knew Johnson from earlier, and maybe it was a try  
to use connections, like in the boys' network,'' Haeggman said. 
``But he did never tell me anything more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Anderson, president of Great Basin Engineering of Ogden,  
Utah, said Tuesday he may have talked to Bjane Haeggman about 
forming a design team to do work for the Salt Lake Olympics, ``but 
nothing ever came of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We tried very hard to get the work, but politics was involved.  
The other engineers were making contributions (to the Olympics.) We 
weren't that wealthy,'' Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Anderson was bidding to design the Olympic ski  
jumps and bobsled-luge run in Park City. The $3 million contract 
was instead awarded to Salt Lake City firm of Eckhoff, Watson &AMP; 
Preator Engineering, said Greg Thorpe, Eckhoff's director of 
development services. 
</P>
<P>
	Thorpe said his firm didn't give the Salt Lake Organizing  
Committee cash or in-kind contributions until after it was awarded 
the state contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Two South American IOC members who have been identified by Salt  
Lake City investigators in the scandal also said they had done 
nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuador's Agustin Arroyo said in a telephone interview from  
Guayaquil that his stepdaughter, Nancy, had worked briefly for Utah 
state government restoring paintings but denied reports that she 
had also worked for and received scholarship aid from the Salt Lake 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``No family member of mine has worked for the Salt Lake City  
Organizing Committee, nor has any family member received a 
scholarship or grant of any kind,'' Arroyo said. 
</P>
<P>
	And Chilean Olympic Committee president Sergio Santander denied  
having received any money from Salt Lake and said he had asked the 
organizing committee's investigators for more information. 
</P>
<P>
	Santander said he was ``deeply upset'' about reports that former  
SLOC leader Thomas Welch had contributed $10,000 to his campaign 
for mayor of Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
	Haeggman now works for the Helsinki committee bidding for the  
2006 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see that as a questionable position,'' she said. ``IOC  
members have worked for their countries' committees before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haeggman said she would submit a thorough report to the IOC  
about her alleged link to her husband's work for Salt Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC sent letters this week to members implicated in the  
investigation and demanding an explanation. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC executive board is scheduled to meet Jan. 24 to take  
action against any members found guilty of impropriety. IOC 
president Juan Antonio Samaranch has said guilty members would be 
expelled or asked to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	Haeggman said she had no intention of quitting.

<HEADLINE> FBI Blocks 11,584 Guns Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Using computerized instant background checks  
to block 11,584 gun sales since Nov. 30, the FBI discovered 1,541 
would-be gun buyers were wanted for arrest and set out to catch 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the 11,584 denials were for prospective gun buyers who  
turned out to be convicted felons, the FBI said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI background checkers found outstanding arrest warrants for  
1,541 of the buyers and then alerted the state or federal law 
enforcement agency that was seeking the person so it could attempt 
an arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	The bureau did not have a total for the arrests that resulted.  
But they included a man in Oklahoma for embezzlement; a woman in 
Texas for tampering with government records; one man in Indiana for 
child neglect and another there for larceny; a man in Texas for 
criminal nonsupport of family members; and a man in Missouri, a 
woman in Nebraska and a man in Mississippi on separate fraud 
warrants. 
</P>
<P>
	The barred sales represented a tiny fraction of the 1,030,606  
gun sales on which the bureau did background checks from the 26 
states and territories for which it does all gun-sale checks and 
the 11 states where it checks long-gun sales. 
</P>
<P>
	An additional 462,298 background checks were performed in the 16  
states that conduct all their own checks and the 11 states that 
check handgun sales, the FBI said. But the bureau did not have any 
data on how many of those applications were denied. 
</P>
<P>
	The computerized, instant check system established by the Brady  
Act began operation Nov. 30 and is designed to thwart gun sales to 
criminals, drug users and others barred from buying handguns, 
rifles or shotguns. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI data cover the period from Nov. 30 through Jan. 10,  
excluding Christmas Day, roughly coinciding with the heaviest 
gun-buying period of the year -- the Christmas gift season. 
</P>
<P>
	In the checks performed by the FBI, 75 percent resulted in  
immediate clearance to sell the weapon. The remaining 25 percent 
required further checking by the FBI, but that additional checking 
only delayed the sale for up to three days in all but the 11,584 
cases where the transaction was blocked. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law bans gun purchases by people convicted or under  
indictment on felony charges, fugitives, the mentally ill, those 
with dishonorable military discharges, those who have renounced 
U.S. citizenship, illegal aliens, illegal drug users and those 
convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors or under domestic 
violence restraining orders. State laws add other categories.

<HEADLINE> FBI Director Freeh To Visit Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- FBI Director Louis J. Freeh will make his  
first trip to Mexico to discuss joint efforts against drug 
trafficking and other major crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	During his visit Thursday and Friday, Freeh will meet with  
Mexican Attorney General Jorge Madrazo Cuellar, Government 
Secretary Fransico Labastida Ochoa and others. The visit follows a 
joint training session for Mexican and U.S. lawmen in South 
Carolina last November hosted by Attorney General Janet Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	Outstanding law enforcement issues between the two countries  
include the U.S. desire to have its agents authorized to carry 
firearms into Mexico when working on joint anti-drug operations. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, U.S. officials have been dismayed that, despite  
polygraph testing and background checks by U.S. officials, a series 
of Mexican law enforcement and military units assigned to anti-drug 
work have had agents and officials corrupted by bribes from 
free-spending drug traffickers.

<HEADLINE> McGwire's 70th Sells for $3 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mark McGwire topped the Babe and Sammy again.  
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's 70th home run ball sold at auction Tuesday night for  
more than $3 million -- well above November's record price of 
$126,500 for a ball that Babe Ruth hit for the first home run in 
Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	An anonymous telephone bidder bought McGwire's record home run  
ball, which was sold by Guernsey's auction house at a special sale 
at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	The total price includes the bid of $2.7 million plus a $305,000  
commission to the auction house, bringing the total to $3,005,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Sammy Sosa's final home run of the season, his 66th, sold for  
$150,000, plus a 15 percent commission, bringing the total price to 
$172,500. 
</P>
<P>
	When the price on the McGwire ball reached $1.6 million, the  
auction came down to a one-on-one bidding battle between the 
invisible phone voice and Irwin Sternberg, president of Stonehenge, 
Ltd., manufacturers of fine neckwear. 
</P>
<P>
	The two went back and forth in increments of $100,000 until  
Sternberg stopped at $2.6 million. Later, Sternberg said he was 
sorry he didn't go higher. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the person on the line didn't have a bottom line,'' he  
said. ``If it went to $3 million, it would be $3.1 million.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Sternberg paid $60,000 for a ball signed by Babe Ruth and  
Roger Maris, who were the previous holders of the home run record. 
He said he would give the ball to the Jimmy V foundation which 
raises funds for cancer research in the memory of deceased college 
basketball coach Jim Valvano. 
</P>
<P>
	``Three million is an extraordinary accomplishment. It's 23  
times the world record for any baseball ever sold, and five to six 
times the record of any sports artifact,'' said Arlen Ettinger, 
president of Guernsey's. 
</P>
<P>
	The ball, hit on McGwire's last swing of his record-breaking  
season, was retrieved at Busch Stadium Sept. 27 by Philip Ozersky, 
a research scientist at Washington University. He had turned down 
$1 million from private collectors. 
</P>
<P>
	Ozersky seemed calm but in awe of what he had witnessed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Who would have thought that a $10 baseball would go for $2  
million,'' he said, inexplicably ignoring about a million dollars 
the buyer agreed to pay. ``I'm excited and overwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went to a baseball game and all of a sudden this happened.''  
</P>
<P>
	Also up for sale Tuesday were other home run balls from the 1998  
race to the record -- McGwire's No. 63, No. 67 and No. 68, and 
Sosa's No. 61 -- as well as a ball signed by former record-holder 
Roger Maris, and the usual run of Ruth and Lou Gehrig items. 
</P>
<P>
	Hank Aaron's 755th career homer -- his last -- was withdrawn from  
sale after bidding reached only $800,000. The minimum auction price 
apparently was not reached, although the auction house did not 
disclose what that price was. 
</P>
<P>
	A ball said to be Mickey Mantle's 500th homer, hit May 14, 1967,  
also was withdrawn from sale after questions arose about its 
authenticity. 
</P>
<P>
	In September 1996, the ball Eddie Murray hit for his 500th home  
run was sold for what one day could be $500,000. Michael Lasky, the 
founder of the Psychic Friends Network, paid $280,000 that was put 
in an annuity to be paid over 20 years. With interest, the annuity 
will be worth about $500,000, according to a spokesman for Lasky, 
who also operates as syndicated handicapper Mike Warren. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa's No. 66 was sold by Albert Chapa, who grabbed it Sept. 25  
at the Astrodome. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Ozersky and Chapa were offered autographed paraphernalia in  
exchange for their historic souvenirs, but they declined. 
</P>
<P>
	Ozersky was minding his business, sipping a beer when McGwire  
turned on the first pitch he saw from Montreal's Carl Pavano in the 
seventh inning and sent it ricocheting off some metal bleachers, 
into the Washington University box. There was a scramble, and after 
Ozersky came up with the ball, he was hustled away by security 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	Chapa took a co-worker to the Cubs-Astros game in the Astrodome.  
He joked about catching a home run and pledged to be in place each 
time Sosa came to the plate. A page from a customer had him on the 
phone for the entire third inning, but when Sosa came up in the 
fourth, Chapa returned to his seat in time to see Jose Lima serve 
up No. 66. It bounced off a couple of hands and landed at his feet, 
much as McGwire's No. 70 would with Ozersky. 
</P>
<P>
	Major league baseball secretly marked each ball to certify  
authenticity. That wasn't necessary with Aaron's No. 755 because at 
the time, no one knew it would be his last. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's Aaron's No. 755.  
</P>
<P>
	Richard Arndt was a groundskeeper at Milwaukee County Stadium  
when Aaron hit the final home run of his career on July 20, 1976. 
There was no way to tell it would be the career home run leader's 
last one, but Arndt wanted to return it. The Brewers, however, 
refused to set up a meeting, so Arndt refused to return the ball. 
The decision cost him his job. 
</P>
<P>
	Arndt retrieved the ball and was asked to turn it over to the  
Brewers, who were returning Aaron's home runs to him. The 
groundskeeper preferred to make the presentation himself and when 
he was told he couldn't, he took the ball home. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, he was notified by the club that he was being  
fired for removing club property from the ballpark. What's more, 
Arndt had $5 deducted from his final paycheck to cover the cost of 
the baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	After it was withdrawn at $800,000, he still has the ball.

<HEADLINE> Butler: Inpectors To Return to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler is  
promising his agency will return to work in Iraq, possibly with a 
less intrusive monitoring mission to keep close watch on President 
Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
	``UNSCOM is not dead,'' Butler said of the U.N. Special  
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, U.N. weapons inspectors are designing an expansive  
monitoring program to ensure the Iraqi president doesn't rebuild 
weapons destroyed as required by the 1991 Gulf War cease-fire, he 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had one (monitoring system) there since 1994, but  
clearly in the future it will have to be bigger in scope, range, 
staffing,'' Butler said in remarks to a non-proliferation 
conference sponsored by the Carnegie Endowment for International 
Peace. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be back under this new dispensation,'' said Butler, who  
noted that it could take months for the U.N. Security Council and 
member states to approve such a plan and that the resolution is not 
yet assured. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S.-British airstrikes on Iraq Dec. 16-19 -- launched after  
Butler said Baghdad wasn't cooperating with U.N. inspectors -- 
effectively ended UNSCOM's work to ensure Iraq destroyed its 
chemical and biological weapons and most missiles and does not 
rebuild them. 
</P>
<P>
	Allegations that U.S. intelligence agencies used UNSCOM to spy  
on Iraq have damaged the image of the old UNSCOM system, but Butler 
has repeatedly rejected the charges. Intelligence help from the 
United States and 35 to 40 other countries, Butler said, ``has been 
deployed for the purpose of our disarmament and monitoring mandates 
and that alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Butler confirmed that all U.N. monitoring of Iraq has stopped,  
including high surveillance flights by American U-2 spy planes. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Atomic Energy Agency, which was charged with  
verifying Iraq had halted its nuclear weapons development, last 
year began a monitoring program like the one now envisioned for 
UNSCOM. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Security Council approves a less intrusive system, UNSCOM  
would shift its focus from surprise inspections and aggressive 
document searches -- which angered Iraq and uncovered Baghdad's 
efforts to conceal its weapons program -- to an operation that would 
widely monitor Iraq to ensure it wasn't resuming major weapons 
development, Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Such monitoring was supposed to have started only after UNSCOM  
declared Iraq free of weapons of mass destruction. U.N. economic 
sanctions also were to be lifted if UNSCOM said Iraq had fully 
disarmed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration backs maintaining robust U.N. weapons  
inspections, although U.S. officials haven't ruled out a revamped 
UNSCOM. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said U.N. resolutions  
requiring disarmament of Iraq before monitoring can begin ``can't 
be leapfrogged.'' But he added, ``We have always been open to ideas 
to improve the professionalism, the competence and the 
effectiveness of the U.N. Special Commission's regime and we will 
continue to be willing to discuss any such ideas with our partners 
in the Security Council.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It remains unclear whether Saddam would invite UNSCOM inspectors  
back into Iraq under any system in light of the U.S.-British 
airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the four-day attack, Saddam also has challenged other U.S.  
and U.N. controls, including ``no-fly'' zones over northern and 
southern Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest U.S.-Iraq confrontation, U.S. Air Force planes  
fired missiles at two Iraqi air defense installations in separate 
incidents Monday in the north after determining they were about to 
be attacked. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the American fighter jets came under Iraqi fire, the  
Pentagon said. It was the fifth ``no-fly'' clash involving missiles 
since Dec. 28. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has vowed to continue patrolling the  
``no-fly'' zones as part of a strategy of keeping Saddam contained 
by diminishing his ability to attack opposition groups and 
neighboring nations.

<HEADLINE> IOC To Recommend Expulsions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The IOC has enough evidence to complete  
its bribery investigation and will recommend expelling some members 
and changing how cities are awarded the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The report by the six-member IOC commission investigating  
bribery allegations in Salt Lake City's winning bid for the 2002 
Winter Games will be published Jan. 24 after a meeting of the 
International Olympic Committee's executive board in Lausanne, 
Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	``The commission has identified improper behavior by certain IOC  
members with respect to the Salt Lake City bid,'' the IOC said 
through its newly hired New York public relations firm, Hill &AMP; 
Knowlton. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC sent letters this week to members implicated in the  
investigation, demanding an explanation. IOC president Juan Antonio 
Samaranch has said guilty members -- at least eight are believed to 
have been implicated -- would be expelled or asked to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also will include recommended changes in the bidding  
for Olympic Games and the IOC election process. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal forced the SLOC to cancel its Thursday meeting  
because the committee's ethics panel isn't ready to report results 
of its investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation by the five-member panel, which has a Feb. 11  
deadline, is one of four inquiries examining accusations of lavish 
gifts, cash and scholarships given to IOC members and their 
relatives by the Salt Lake bid committee that landed the games in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The other investigations are by the U.S. Olympic Committee and  
the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	As international and local organizers struggled with the worst  
corruption scandal in Olympic history, even the mascot for the Salt 
Lake Games was lying low. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers Tuesday indefinitely postponed the unveiling of Salt  
Lake's official mascot. 
</P>
<P>
	The unveiling was to have been Feb. 8, coinciding with the  
three-year countdown to the 2002 Winter Games. A date for the 
mascot's debut will be announced next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to introduce the mascot for 2002 in an atmosphere of  
community celebration. This is not the appropriate time,'' said 
Shelley Thomas, senior vice president of the Salt Lake Organizing 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our first priority right now is the prompt resolution of all  
inquiries, and taking whatever action is necessary to move forward 
from this difficult period,'' Thomas said. ``Our mascot should 
receive the positive attention it deserves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers originally hoped to show the mascot during the  
closing ceremonies of the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano, Japan, then 
later in time for the Christmas season. 
</P>
<P>
	But focus groups in several cities thought early designs didn't  
look Olympic enough, and the IOC only recently approved the design. 
</P>
<P>
	In other Olympic developments:  
</P>
<P>
	-- David Johnson, the SLOC executive vice president forced to  
resign Friday because of his prominent role in the bid process, was 
accused of attacking a TV crew on his doorstep Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson yelled at Remi Barron, a reporter for KSTU, and  
cameraman Charlie Ehlert, to get off his property. He then grabbed 
a microphone from Barron, kicked Ehlert and took his camera, 
according to the station, which showed part of the struggle it 
caught on tape. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who apologized to the crew, has an unlisted phone  
number and could not be reached for comment. His wife, Kimberly 
Johnson, on leave from her news position at a rival station, 
returned the camera and no charges were filed. 
</P>
<P>
	--The SLOC ethics panel has divided its investigation into five  
categories: cash payments, gifts, travel reimbursement, 
scholarships and miscellaneous, said Vicki Varela, spokeswoman for 
Gov. Mike Leavitt. 
</P>
<P>
	Varela said the panel has not confirmed accusations that female  
escort or prostitution services were provided to visiting IOC 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	``An allegation about prostitution is extreme in the scheme of  
things, but one thing you learn to do is measure very carefully how 
much substantiation there is to things before you blow your top,'' 
Varela said. ``You'd be blowing your top all day otherwise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--An IOC member from Finland, Pirjo Haeggman, denied any  
wrongdoing in connection with reports her ex-husband had worked for 
Salt Lake's bid committee. She said she had no intention of 
resigning. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times reported Haeggman's former husband worked  
briefly for the bid committee on an environmental study. 
</P>
<P>
	Haeggman said her ex-husband, Bjarne, ``desperately had looked  
for a job for two years, home or abroad,'' but that at the time of 
the reported work in 1993 they were splitting up. The couple 
divorced in 1995 and Haeggman now works for the Helsinki committee 
bidding for the 2006 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	--The only IOC member to quit in an ethics scandal said Samaranch  
and other leaders should resign. Former U.S. Olympic Committee 
president Robert Helmick said Samaranch should follow the example 
of SLOC's top officials, who stepped down last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'd expect the president of the IOC to adhere to a higher  
standard,'' Helmick said. ``He should resign. The IOC's officers 
should resign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Two South American IOC members identified by Salt Lake  
investigators in the scandal also said they had done nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuador's Agustin Arroyo said from Guayaquil that his  
stepdaughter, Nancy, had worked briefly for the Utah state 
government restoring paintings but denied she had also worked for 
and received scholarship aid from the Salt Lake committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``No family member of mine has worked for the Salt Lake City  
Organizing Committee, nor has any family member received a 
scholarship or grant of any kind,'' Arroyo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chilean Olympic Committee president Sergio Santander denied  
receiving any money from Salt Lake and said he had asked SLOC's 
investigators for more information. 
</P>
<P>
	Santander said he was ``deeply upset'' about reports that former  
SLOC leader Thomas Welch had given $10,000 to his campaign for 
mayor of Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Associated Press reported that African Olympic official  
Jean-Claude Ganga will fight any attempts to oust him from the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not going to lay down and die,'' a knowledgeable Olympic  
source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``He will only go 
if there is absolutely no other way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga, of the Republic of Congo, is among the IOC members under  
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	--In New York, two Olympic greats said the bribery scandal is  
just an example of the way Olympics business is done. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Spitz and Carl Lewis, who each won a record nine Olympic  
gold medals, said corruption was rampant in the bidding process for 
cities. 
</P>

	``I don't think anyone believes that this is the first time this  
has happened,'' Lewis said. ``I don't think anyone believes that 
this has not gone on before. I don't know of any organization that 
has more power or makes more money that is less regulated in the 
entire world than the IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spitz said work as a consultant for Stockholm's unsuccessful bid  
for the 2004 Summer Games showed him the darker side of the 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``We communicated with the 100 or so (IOC) delegates and there  
was this definite undertow in all the conversations, and that was, 
`What benefit is it going to be to my country?' which is more or 
less saying, `What benefit is it going to be to me if in effect I 
vote for this city?''' Spitz said.

<HEADLINE> Tyson: I'm Boxings Biggest Draw </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Mike Tyson needs only look in the mirror to see  
the fighter he believes is the biggest draw in boxing history. 
</P>
<P>
	Who else, he reasons, could make millions of dollars for a  
scheduled 10-round fight against a fighter like Francois Botha. 
</P>
<P>
	``Muhammad Ali set the stage, but there's never been a fighter  
bigger than Mike Tyson,'' Tyson said. ``If you don't think that's 
true, look at the gate receipts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A look at the economics of Saturday's fight against Botha could  
indeed bolster Tyson's contention. 
</P>
<P>
	Just how much he'll make for his latest comeback is unclear, but  
one thing is clear -- he remains the biggest money generating 
machine in the history of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Though ticket sales at the fight site itself are reportedly  
sluggish, Tyson's first fight since biting Evander Holyfield's ears 
is expected to lure up to 1 million households to shell out $45.95 
each for the chance to see him in action again. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are just intrigued by his personal story and the way he  
fights,'' said Jay Larkin, executive producer for Showtime, which 
will carry the pay-per-view. ``People watch to cheer him on, they 
watch to see him lose, they watch to see the car wrecks. People 
either love him or they hate him but they all feel strongly about 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Depending on how many people buy the fight on television, Tyson  
could make millions more to fight Botha than Holyfield will make to 
try and unify the heavyweight title against WBC champion Lennox 
Lewis on March 13 at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can't make any money without me,'' Tyson said Monday.  
``They make $20 million to defend a title and the other guy gets 
$10 million. I make $35 million for fighting a 10-rounder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson may not reach the $35 million mark for Botha -- some  
estimates have him making slightly more than $20 million -- but it's 
easy to see that he will be the best paid athlete in the world if 
he fights four times in 1999 as currently planned. 
</P>
<P>
	If all goes well -- and in boxing it almost never does -- Tyson's  
last fight of the year would be in November against Holyfield, a 
fight that would likely set records for the amount of money brought 
in. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I could finish all my (four) fights by the end of the year,  
it would be awesome,'' Tyson said. ``Then I'd be a free agent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Making money, of course, has always been easy for Tyson. Keeping  
it has been another problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson was paid more than $100 million for a series of six fights  
in his first comeback after his release from prison in 1995, 
although contracts show that former promoter Don King and his 
former co-managers took more than half of that. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson was basically broke and owed the IRS $13 million when  
Nevada boxing authorities gave him back his license to box in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
	His fight against Botha will take care of the tax liens, then  
Tyson's new advisers can only hope that he can manage his money at 
the age of 32 better than he has on the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just happy to fight again and to be able to take care of  
my family like a man should,'' Tyson said.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Facing Endorsement Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Will people still want to ``Be Like Mike'' after  
the NBA star who inspired that advertising phrase puts his Air 
Jordans on the shelf for the last time? 
</P>
<P>
	That's a serious concern to a dozen sponsors ranging from  
Gatorade drinks and Hanes underwear to MCI WorldCom phone service 
who are collectively paying Michael Jordan an estimated $42 million 
to $47 million a year in endorsement deals. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also a concern to the NBA, which would like to have the  
player who has led the Chicago Bulls to six championships in action 
when its begins playing next month after an acrimonious six-month 
lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jordan is expected to announce his retirement Wednesday from  
the NBA, where he is viewed by many as the best to play the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``His advertisers will not be surprised by his decision but they  
will be disappointed that Michael hasn't chosen to extend his 
career another year or two,'' said Bob Williams, who heads Burns 
Sports, a Chicago firm that matches advertisers and athletes. 
``It's a definite blow to advertisers who have him under 
contract.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's endorsement durability survived a short-lived  
retirement from basketball a few years ago. The experts say he 
makes more from endorsements than any other athlete. 
</P>
<P>
	When he quits the NBA for good, Jordan will face a test of how  
to remain a powerful force for his sponsors' products. 
</P>
<P>
	The retired athletes who can do that are rare -- baseball's Joe  
Dimaggio was a popular pitchman for Mr. Coffee well after his 
playing days and Jim Palmer can still be seen inviting viewers to 
The Money Store. 
</P>
<P>
	But many other onetime stars find advertisers quit calling once  
they are no longer hitting home runs, scoring touchdowns or 
slamming a basketball through the hoop regularly in a sports arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Some marketing experts and the companies with deals with Jordan  
say this time will be different, however. 
</P>
<P>
	They said Jordan raised the level of how involved an athlete  
could become with an endorser. He signed multi-year deals rather 
than one-shot commercial arrangements. And his popularity helped 
sponsors' business and image. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just as Michael broke the mold within the league, he can do it  
for the retired athlete as well,'' said Ryan Schinman, a marketing 
executive at Worldwide Entertainment &AMP; Sports, a New York agency 
that represents athletes and matches companies with sports figures. 
</P>
<P>
	He may be best-known for his association with Nike Inc., which  
signed Jordan shortly after he turned pro in 1984. The sneaker 
company named a line of shoes Air Jordan after him to call 
attention to his gravity-defying ability to leap to the basket and 
change the direction of his shot as he approached the hoop. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike declined comment pending a statement from Jordan on reports  
he would retire. But its stock tumbled $2.37 1/2 a share, or 5.3 
percent, to $42 on the New York Stock Exchange 
</P>
<P>
	The company has been taking steps to prepare for Jordan's  
eventual retirement, creating a separate division last year for the 
Jordan brand of shoes and apparel and saying Jordan would play an 
important role in that business. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Be Like Mike'' ad phrase was used as recently as last year  
by Quaker Oats Co.'s Gatorade sports drink division. He is under 
contract until 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Sue Wellington, president of the Gatorade U.S. division, said  
the company plans to feature Jordan in its ads this year no matter 
what he decides about playing basketball. ``It's not about what he 
is doing, but who he is,'' she said, saying his competitive spirit 
makes him an effective spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Two companies have been using Jordan in their ads recently  
without making any reference to his NBA playing, and they expect he 
will remain valuable either as an active or retired player. 
</P>
<P>
	Rayovac Corp., the battery maker from Madison, Wis., signed  
Jordan after he ended his first NBA retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we first got involved with Jordan, we made a conscious  
effort to portray him as person rather than a basketball player,'' 
said Rayovac spokesman John Daggett. ``His image has transcended 
the sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daggett said Jordan has helped Rayovac introduce what has become  
the leading rechargeable battery and built its share of the market 
for maximum alkaline batteries against bigger rivals Energizer and 
Duracell. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom has been featuring Jordan talking with his animated  
pals from his ``Space Jam'' movie from Warner Bros. in ads for its 
Sunday calling rates. ``We will be happy with the arrangement even 
if he decides to retire,'' said MCI WorldCom spokeswoman Kelly 
Seachrist. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael Jordan is so well known and so successful that we  
think that puts him a cut above the other athletes,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Gore Wooing Farmers in 2000 Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore is trumpeting millions  
of dollars in federal support for agriculture as he tries to 
improve his standing among farmers in preparation for a 2000 
presidential bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Traveling through Iowa last week, Gore announced the government  
would give $50 million in direct payments to struggling pork 
producers. An additional $80 million will be used to buy diseased 
pigs to help ease the industry's oversupply problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know what it's like to pay the feed bill and not be able to  
get the money back when you sell,'' he told farmers in Sioux City, 
Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Gore announced a $15 million pork purchase, bringing  
to $65 million the amount of pork the government agreed to buy to 
help prices. In the same month, the vice president said the 
government would spend $20 million on beef to help cattle 
producers. 
</P>
<P>
	In October, Gore again used Iowa as a backdrop to announce a  
deal that opened Argentina's market to U.S. pork, long banned 
because of concerns about disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Both pork and beef hail from voter rich states.  
</P>
<P>
	Iowa, crucial to Gore since its state precinct caucuses launch  
the nominating season, is the nation's largest hog state, with 
about 18,000 producers. North Carolina, Minnesota, Illinois, 
Missouri, Indiana, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Ohio are the other major 
hog states. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, the cattle industry dominates states like Texas and  
California -- both crucial states for any presidential contender. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore spokesman Chris Lahane said the vice president is helping  
farmers in their time of need and pointed out that as a senator 
Gore represented rural Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	``His family owned a farm. He's obviously very familiar with  
farmers and agriculture,'' Lahane said. 
</P>
<P>
	But even agricultural officials agree that having farmers as a  
key constituency can't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously any candidate, especially the vice president ...  
would naturally try to be perceived as much as possible as a friend 
of the farmer,'' said Dick Newpher, executive director of the 
Washington office of the American Farm Bureau Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	``While nationally the farm vote is probably 2 percent or more,  
in individual states it can make a difference, especially during 
the primary season,'' Newpher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore hasn't always been viewed warmly among farmers, many of  
whom are wary of his advocacy of environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think over the next year or so he'll make as many  
announcements as he can on agricultural issues in order to raise 
his standing in the agricultural community and change his 
perception,'' Newpher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, Gore began making overtures to farmers several months  
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, he pushed for the creation of an advisory panel to  
balance farm and environmental interests in implementing new 
pesticide regulations. The panel idea came after a warning from 
Democratic Reps. Charles Stenholm of Texas and Marion Berry of 
Arkansas that rumors about the loss of widely used pesticides was 
causing an uproar in key political states. 
</P>
<P>
	G. Chandler Keys, vice president of public policy for the  
National Cattlemen's Beef Association, said America's farmers and 
ranchers could be the key to Gore's gaining ground in rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``All those areas in rural America kind of look to farmers and  
ranchers,'' Keys said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steffen Schmidt, a political science professor at Iowa State  
University, described the link between farmers and their rural 
communities as the ``ripple effect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The small communities depend very much on the survival of  
family farms,'' Schmidt said, noting that in rural areas everyone 
from the local grocer to the small cafe owner depends on farmer 
business. ``Farmers are a significant constituency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Gore may have to walk a political tightrope to gain farmers'  
approval while not losing his environmental support, Keys said. 
</P>
<P>
	``How do you make sure you don't embrace one and abandon  
another?'' Keys said. ``I think that will be his challenge.''

<HEADLINE> Gambling Execs Warned To Tend Ills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Legalized gambling -- a $600 billion annual  
industry that has spread to 48 of the 50 states -- must tend to its 
own ills or the federal government may do so, the head of a 
national panel said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fix your own problems,'' Kay Coles James, chairwoman of the  
National Gambling Impact Study Commission, told a meeting of 
gambling industry executives. ``The federal government isn't the 
answer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James, who identified herself as a Reagan conservative, said she  
does not believe the federal government has a solution for every 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I do know that the government often acts when others fail  
to and the 'cure' is usually far worse than the problem,'' James 
told the two-day Gaming, Lodging and Leisure Summit, which 
concludes Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are many who believe that the record tobacco settlement  
could have been avoided if the industry had acknowledged the 
problem and taken proactive steps to address it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She challenged industry leaders to take on issues such as  
compulsive and Internet gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	James said there have been discussions nationally ``about  
potential product-liability for gaming operators regarding 
pathological gamblers. Some have gone so far as to suggest that 
this will be the 'tobacco issue' of the new millennium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said such talk should concern casino operators, but should  
be of even more concern to states engaged in lotteries, especially 
those that use ``slick, misleading campaigns'' to draw from those 
least able to afford it. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine-member commission was approved by Congress in 1996 to  
study the sociological and economic impact of legalized gambling in 
America. The commission is scheduled to present a report to 
Congress in June.

<HEADLINE>  State Dinner Breaks Into Tango </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Inspired as he watched Robert Duvall  
effortlessly glide across the floor of the White House's East Room, 
President Clinton gave up his sideline seat and showed the 
Argentine delegation that he can tango with the best of them. 
</P>
<P>
	The president and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton capped off a  
state dinner tribute to Argentine President Carlos Menem Monday 
night by indulging in a few rounds of the sensual dance form. 
</P>
<P>
	Menem escorted the U.S. first lady to the dance floor, while the  
president perfected his tango technique with Amanda de Fernandez, 
the wife of Argentina's minister of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Duvall, who became smitten with the dance after seeing it  
performed 12 years ago and has honed his abilities in more than 15 
visits to Buenos Aires, dazzled the 170 guests who watched him 
glide across the makeshift dance floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll never look at you the same way again, Robert!'' exclaimed  
the president, after watching Duvall with his partner, Luciana 
Pedraza. The chamber ensemble QuinTango provided the music as the 
pair and another couple, Pablo Veron and Victoria Vieyra, 
performed. 
</P>
<P>
	Menem, in his official toast, pointed to Duvall's chairmanship  
of the U.S. Tango Academy as an example of the strong ties that 
connect the people of the two nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course the bonds of friendship between the presidents are  
very deep,'' Menem said through a translator. ``But as deep are the 
bonds of friendship that bring together the people of Argentina and 
the people of America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his salute, Clinton described some of the values held by both  
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We share aspirations old and new, to deepen democracy, to  
strengthen justice ... to give other people the chance to live as 
peacefully and as positively as possible at the dawn of this new 
century,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, the president warned, some disputes will never be  
resolved, ``like which country has the better beef ... or whose 
cooks have better mastered the ancient art of barbecue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, noticeably missing from the menu was beef, which the  
Argentines consider one of their best agricultural products. 
</P>
<P>
	But tango proved to be common ground, with celebrities and  
politicians alike taking a whirl as the night went on. Sen. 
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., was among the revelers taken with tango 
fever as was actress Salma Hayek, who gave the president kudos for 
his technique. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very impressed,'' Hayek said. ``He did wonderfully.''  
</P>
<P>
	The festive mood, and the focus on U.S.-Argentina relations,  
even managed to divert attention from the impeachment trial before 
the Senate. The guest list included seven of the 100 senators 
standing in judgment of the president, but several said they could 
put the question aside for the evening. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very important thing our country is doing, our  
relationship with Argentina, and we're grateful to be a part of 
that,'' said Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind. ``We are serving the 
country tonight and so is our president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guests dined on lemon herb roasted chicken, grilled vegetable  
risotto, tomato basil broth, seared striped bass, a cassoulet of 
crab, corn and fava beans, sauteed morels and sweet potato, with a 
salad of kale, endive and spinach. 
</P>
<P>
	For dessert, it was back to Argentina: Frozen dulce de leche, a  
confection of caramel and baked pineapple ringed with fresh coconut 
and red currant, and topped with a couple made of chocolate, 
dancing the tango beneath a palm tree.

<HEADLINE> Albright Advises Against Clemency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is  
telling President Clinton that there are ``no compelling foreign 
policy considerations'' to justify releasing convicted spy Jonathan 
Pollard, a senior official said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright, in a confidential recommendation, also is underscoring  
the need to maintain diplomatic security, the official said, 
speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Pollard, a former U.S. Navy analyst, was convicted of espionage  
for giving Israel thousands of top-secret documents. He is serving 
a life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is expected to make a decision soon on an Israeli  
request for clemency. Albright's views, combined with the known 
opposition of CIA Director George Tenet to release Pollard, could 
seal his fate. 
</P>
<P>
	Her stance on the Pollard case suggests that she sees no shock  
to U.S. relations with Israel if Pollard remains imprisoned. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Senate Intelligence Committee's two top members,  
concerned Clinton may grant clemency to Pollard, urged other 
senators to join them in a letter to the president asking him not 
do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., the committee chairman, said he had  
encouraged Clinton ``to rethink what I understand may be his 
expected course of action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was backed by the vice chairman, Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., and  
virtually all members of the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Pollard was convicted as a spy for handing over thousands of  
top-secret documents to Israel in 1984 and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Releasing him, Shelby said in a statement accompanying the  
letter, ``would set a dangerous and unwise precedent that crimes 
against the United States are not serious. It would also undermine 
our country's ability to act as an honest broker throughout the 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton confirmed last month that he promised Israeli Prime  
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at U.S.-sponsored negotiations with the 
Palestinians in October that he would look into Netanyahu's request 
for leniency for Pollard. 
</P>
<P>
	White House counsel Charles Ruff was directed to solicit views  
of U.S. intelligence and security agencies. Several former U.S. 
intelligence officials hotly opposed clemency and asserted that 
Pollard attempted to provide classified information to other 
countries before striking a deal with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	At FBI headquarters Thursday, spokesman Frank Scafidi said,  
``Justice has been done to this point. To release Pollard now would 
undo everything that law enforcement and prosecutors worked 
tirelessly to accomplish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department's criminal division adamantly opposes  
clemency, senior officials said Thursday, requesting anonymity. 
Justice and FBI officials believe Pollard has never fully 
cooperated in assessing what secrets he sold the Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno said she would send Ruff a  
recommendation by today. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Pentagon, spokesman Kenneth Bacon refused last week to  
say what Defense Secretary William Cohen was telling Ruff. But 
Bacon, asked about the Pentagon's position, said: ``The Pentagon 
has been strongly opposed to the release of Jonathan Pollard in the 
past, and I don't expect any change from that position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CIA Director Tenet, who participated with Clinton and Albright  
in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations in rural Maryland, 
vehemently opposed Pollard's release and threatened to resign if it 
happened, an administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked Thursday for Tenet's position on clemency, CIA spokeswoman  
Anya Guilsher said the agency's recommendations are for the White 
House, and ``we are not going to state it publicly.''

<HEADLINE> Whoopi Goldberg To Host Oscars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Whoopi Goldberg will host the  
Academy Awards, taking over for the popular Billy Crystal, the 
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who would have thought that I would be hosting the last Oscar  
telecast of the century? It's a huge deal,'' Miss Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Crystal, who has hosted the show six times, decided last week to  
pass on the 71st installment of the ceremony, according to the 
trade publications Hollywood Reporter and Daily Variety. 
</P>
<P>
	But Miss Goldberg has emceed the show twice in the past five

<P>
	``The audience adores Whoopi and that affection, plus Whoopi's  
extraordinary talent, makes her a terrific host for the show,'' 
Oscar producer Gil Cates said. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldberg won a best supporting actress Oscar in 1991 for her  
role in ``Ghost.'' She earned Emmy nominations for hosting the 
Oscars in 1994 and 1996. Crystal won an Emmy for his work in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Blues Player Wickenheiser Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Doug Wickenheiser, whose dramatic overtime  
playoff goal in 1986 is fondly remembered by St. Louis Blues fans 
as the Monday Night Miracle, died Tuesday of cancer. He was 37. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral arrangements were pending for Wickenheiser, who was with  
the Blues for all or parts of four seasons from 1983-1987. 
Wickenheiser had 51 goals and 67 assists in 230 games with St. 
Louis, and the team used the ex-center's jersey number, 14, as 
inspiration for his battle with the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``Aside from being one of the most exciting hockey players, he  
was a truly great person and had a great family,'' said Susie 
Mathieu, the Blues' publicity director when Wickenheiser was with 
the team. ``He embodied it all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the past two seasons, several Blues players and front office  
personnel, as well as fans, wore T-shirts emblazoned with the 
number 14 atop a burning candle to symbolize hope in Wickenheiser's 
battle. He had been hospitalized since late summer and was on a 
ventilator his last months. 
</P>
<P>
	Wickenheiser's goal completed the Blues' rally from a 5-2  
deficit to beat the Calgary Flames 6-5 in Game 6 of the Campbell 
Conference Finals on May 12, 1986. The Blues trailed by three goals 
with 11:52 to go but scored three goals to force overtime, and 
Wickenheiser got the game-winner at 7:30 of the extra period. 
</P>
<P>
	Teammate Bernie Federko, the franchise's career leading scorer,  
assisted on the goal that he'll never forget. He'll never forget 
Wickenheiser's expression, either. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember the pumping of his fists,'' said Federko, now a  
radio analyst with the team. ``I can see it right now, and the 
smile on his face. That's what we remember him by, not the last few 
months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The victory by the Blues, who were only three games above .500  
in the regular season, forced Game 7, which Calgary won 2-1 to 
advance to the Stanley Cup finals. To many Blues fans, the comeback 
is the crowning glory for a franchise that hasn't made it past the 
second round of the playoffs since. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the young fans especially, those that don't remember the  
Blues going to the finals in their first two seasons, that's 
certainly the special moment,'' Federko said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wickenheiser totaled 111 goals and 156 assists in 556 games in a  
10-season career that also had stops at Montreal, Vancouver, the 
New York Rangers and Washington from 1980-90. 
</P>
<P>
	Wickenheiser, his wife Dianne and three daughters settled in St.  
Louis after his retirement.

<HEADLINE> Murder-Mystery a Real-Life Drama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EASTON, Md. (AP) -- A man was found dead in his smoke-filled  
hotel room last year after he and his wife attended a murder 
mystery play staged for the guests. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, a prosecutor told a jury the case is no whodunit.  
Kimberly Hricko went on trial on charges of murdering her husband, 
Stephen, during what was supposed to be a romantic Valentine's 
weekend getaway. 
</P>
<P>
	She stood to collect on a $200,000 life insurance policy and had  
talked about killing her husband to end their dull marriage, 
prosecutor Robert Dean said in opening statements. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing more that Kimberly Hricko wanted than to get  
rid of her husband,'' Dean said. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense says the evidence is inconclusive, and Hricko was  
depressed and a suicide risk. 
</P>
<P>
	The young couple had been having marital troubles and went on a  
Valentine's Day weekend getaway featuring a campy ``Mafia Wedding'' 
whodunit onstage in which the groom sips poisoned champagne and 
drops dead during a toast and the audience tries to solve the 
mystery. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours later, in the early morning of Feb. 15, Stephen Hricko, a  
35-year-old golf course superintendent, was found dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hricko, 33, told police that after they returned to their  
room, her husband began drinking heavily and tried to pressure her 
into having sex. She said she left to drive to a friend's home in 
Easton but got lost. When she returned, around 1 a.m., she saw 
smoke and went to the front desk for help. A hotel guest and a 
worker broke into the cottage and dragged out Hricko's body. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire, which appeared to have started on or near the bed, had  
burned out, but Hricko was dead. 
</P>
<P>
	One cigar was missing from a new pack. Mrs. Hricko told  
investigators that her husband smoked when he drank. However, 
family and friends told police that Hricko did not drink or smoke. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy found that Hricko had no carbon monoxide in his blood  
and no soot or burns in his trachea or lungs, suggesting he had 
stopped breathing before the fire started. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said Hricko probably died of poisoning, but didn't  
say what poison or how it got into his body. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the Hrickos' marriage was in trouble. The  
couple, who were raising a daughter, now 9, had been attending 
counseling sessions. According to court documents, Mrs. Hricko had 
asked her husband for a divorce, but he refused. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hricko, a surgical technician, had offered a co-worker  
$50,000 to arrange his murder in early 1998 and weeks later 
confided to a friend that she had been planning to give her husband 
a drug that would paralyze him, Dean said. 
</P>
<P>
	She was ``progressively digging herself into a hole of  
violence,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Harry Trainor suggested Hricko was seriously  
depressed and could have been at risk of suicide. He also said 
Hricko worked with toxic pesticides, which may have contributed to 
his death. 
</P>
<P>
	``No medical doctor, pathologist or toxicologist can reliably  
tell us the cause of Stephen Hricko's death,'' Trainor said. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial is expected to last a week.

<HEADLINE> Ratings Willl Suffer Without Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	There has never been a bigger TV draw in the NBA -- maybe even in  
sports history -- than Michael Jordan. And there's no heir apparent. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC and Turner Sports will have to recover from a double hit  
with the six-month lockout and Jordan's retirement, expected to be 
announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have all been fortunate to have been a part of one of the  
most magical rides in sports history,'' said NBC sports chairman 
Dick Ebersol. ``Now, with the NBA and the other television 
partners, we have to reintroduce the new generation of stars in the 
NBA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No single NBA player is in the wings to replace Jordan. There  
may never be another athlete able to lure viewers as the Bulls star 
has done. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's eight regular-season games on NBC posted a 6.5 rating  
last year. The 17 games without Michael were down 71 percent, for a 
3.8 rating. 
</P>
<P>
	His impact was even bigger in the postseason.  
</P>
<P>
	The four most-watched NBA Finals all include Jordan, with last  
year's finals drawing a record 18.7 rating. The two non-Jordan 
finals in '94 and '95 drew a 12.4 and 13.9 rating. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a question of when they will recover,'' said Neal  
Pilson, the former president of CBS Sports who now runs a 
consulting firm. ``The NBA will survive his retirement, but they'll 
definitely be a ratings decline from all of this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The networks, with the help of the league, are expected to  
soften the blow by relying on a core of young players that includes 
Lakers Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, San Antonio's Tim Duncan 
and Detroit's Grant Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anyone's ready to take the baton,'' said TNT  
analyst and former player Doc Rivers. ``Michael is the Babe Ruth, 
and that's the truth. If we're waiting for one guy, we're going to 
be waiting for a long, long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Pacers player Clark Kellogg agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I love Grant's game and personality, but to try and force  
Michael's role on him is unrealistic,'' said Kellogg, now a 
broadcaster for CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	The networks knew this day was coming. The only question was  
when. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is that we expected that Michael would retire at some  
point during our TV contract,'' said Dr. Harvey Schiller, Turner 
Sports President. ``I may have a naive view, but my expectation is 
that Bulls games will go down in ratings, but that other games will 
go up.''

<HEADLINE> Iraq Plans To Raise Oil Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- As oil-producing countries try to cut  
excess global production, Iraq today announced plans to raise its 
output. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq hopes to boost production to 3 million barrels per day from  
the current 2.5 million barrels, and to 3.5 million barrels within 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Faleh al-Khayat, the Oil Ministry's director-general of  
planning, said the increase was contingent upon receiving spare 
parts for the country's ailing oil industry, battered by more than 
eight years of U.N. trade sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq has complained of the slow delivery of spare parts under  
the U.N.-approved oil-for-food program, which is an exception from 
the sanctions. Special chemicals for treating crude oil already 
have started arriving in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	The news helped push oil prices lower this morning on the New  
York Mercantile Exchange. Contracts for future delivery of crude 
oil fell 28 cents to $13.16 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq's oil exports were banned in August 1990 as part of U.N.  
trade sanctions imposed to punish Iraq for invading Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	If sanctions are removed, Iraq can implement contracts it has  
signed with foreign firms, including Russian and Chinese, to add 
another 2.5 million barrels per day to its production, al-Khayat 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In December 1996, the United Nations implemented the  
oil-for-food program, which allows Iraq to export up to $5.2 
billion worth of oil every six months to buy food and other 
humanitarian goods. 
</P>
<P>
	Al-Khayat said even with the increased output Iraq cannot hope  
to earn $5.2 billion in six months because of weak world oil 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq's oil reserves are the world's second largest after Saudi  
Arabia. Its quota set by Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries before the invasion of Kuwait was a little more than 3 
million barrels a day.

<HEADLINE>  State Dinner Breaks Into Tango </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Inspired as he watched Robert Duvall  
effortlessly glide across the floor of the White House's East Room, 
President Clinton gave up his sideline seat and showed the 
Argentine delegation that he can tango with the best of them. 
</P>
<P>
	The president and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton capped off a  
state dinner tribute to Argentine President Carlos Menem Monday 
night by indulging in a few rounds of the sensual dance form. 
</P>
<P>
	Menem escorted the U.S. first lady to the dance floor, while the  
president perfected his tango technique with Amanda de Fernandez, 
the wife of Argentina's minister of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Duvall, who became smitten with the dance after seeing it  
performed 12 years ago and has honed his abilities in more than 15 
visits to Buenos Aires, dazzled the 170 guests who watched him 
glide across the makeshift dance floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll never look at you the same way again, Robert!'' exclaimed  
the president, after watching Duvall with his partner, Luciana 
Pedraza. The chamber ensemble QuinTango provided the music as the 
pair and another couple, Pablo Veron and Victoria Vieyra, 
performed. 
</P>
<P>
	Menem, in his official toast, pointed to Duvall's chairmanship  
of the U.S. Tango Academy as an example of the strong ties that 
connect the people of the two nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course the bonds of friendship between the presidents are  
very deep,'' Menem said through a translator. ``But as deep are the 
bonds of friendship that bring together the people of Argentina and 
the people of America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his salute, Clinton described some of the values held by both  
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We share aspirations old and new, to deepen democracy, to  
strengthen justice ... to give other people the chance to live as 
peacefully and as positively as possible at the dawn of this new 
century,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, the president warned, some disputes will never be  
resolved, ``like which country has the better beef ... or whose 
cooks have better mastered the ancient art of barbecue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, noticeably missing from the menu was beef, which the  
Argentines consider one of their best agricultural products. 
</P>
<P>
	But tango proved to be common ground, with celebrities and  
politicians alike taking a whirl as the night went on. Sen. 
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., was among the revelers taken with tango 
fever as was actress Salma Hayek, who gave the president kudos for 
his technique. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very impressed,'' Hayek said. ``He did wonderfully.''  
</P>
<P>
	The festive mood, and the focus on U.S.-Argentina relations,  
even managed to divert attention from the impeachment trial before 
the Senate. The guest list included seven of the 100 senators 
standing in judgment of the president, but several said they could 
put the question aside for the evening. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very important thing our country is doing, our  
relationship with Argentina, and we're grateful to be a part of 
that,'' said Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind. ``We are serving the 
country tonight and so is our president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guests dined on lemon herb roasted chicken, grilled vegetable  
risotto, tomato basil broth, seared striped bass, a cassoulet of 
crab, corn and fava beans, sauteed morels and sweet potato, with a 
salad of kale, endive and spinach. 
</P>
<P>
	For dessert, it was back to Argentina: Frozen dulce de leche, a  
confection of caramel and baked pineapple ringed with fresh coconut 
and red currant, and topped with a couple made of chocolate, 
dancing the tango beneath a palm tree.

<HEADLINE> Law Students Take Impeachment Class </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- It could be called Impeachment 101.  
</P>
<P>
	Once a week across an oblong seminar table in a cramped  
classroom at DePaul University, 18 law students sit in judgment of 
the President of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an open question as to what is a high crime and  
misdemeanor,'' said aspiring attorney Dan DeLeo, 30, on the first 
day of DePaul Law School's new seminar. ``It depends on your 
interpretation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meeting on Tuesdays at 3 p.m., the class titled ``Impeachment:  
The Case against President William Jefferson Clinton'' uses the 
president's historic trial to offer instruction on a long neglected 
corner of the law. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to me this is the most visible, significant legal  
event this year -- maybe in history,'' said professor Donald H.J. 
Hermann. Still, he said, ``This is very obscure in law school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the first day of class, students could not agree on what  
constitutes a high crime or misdemeanor -- the standard to which 
Clinton's actions are to be held. And they discovered politicians 
and legal scholars can't agree, either. 
</P>
<P>
	T.R. McAlister, 26, said if President Clinton lied under oath,  
there's no room for mercy. The third-year law student believes it 
would amount to subversion of government and warrant removal from 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy Koenig, 25, isn't so sure. Even if Clinton lied, he said, it  
isn't an impeachable offense because his obfuscation didn't harm 
the country. Either way, he said, impeachment should be reserved to 
keep a president from becoming too powerful, not to discipline 
misbehavior. 
</P>
<P>
	``The focus now is on punishing Clinton, when it should be on  
protecting the government,'' he said. ``Even if he did perjure 
himself, he's not harming the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Jeffrey Greenbaum, 25, the process reeks of partisanship.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the framers of the Constitution foresaw it would  
be political instead of legal,'' he said. ``It's all about 
Republicans not liking Democrats and Democrats not liking 
Republicans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The goal of the 15-week class isn't to find all the answers or  
reach consensus, Hermann said. Instead, students will discover how 
the impeachment process works and learn there often exists a 
tug-of-war between the letter and spirit of the law. 
</P>
<P>
	``Law school used to be so formal. If someone said something  
wasn't fair, we'd say it doesn't matter, it's the law,'' Hermann 
said. ``We've changed, and we're more concerned about fairness. We 
see other aspects of social and political life interacting with the 
law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hermann encourages his students to criticize the impeachment  
process. They will be required to write a paper analyzing the trial 
or offer alternative punishments. 
</P>
<P>
	Students said the class gives them the chance to study a current  
Constitutional problem, rather than the typical classes on the 
First Amendment or abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Constitutional law, it usually almost feels like a dead  
subject; one that's in the past,'' Koenig said. ``This is happening 
today.''

<HEADLINE> Yahoo! Earnings Exceed Projections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISC0 (AP) -- Yahoo! Inc. earned $18.5 million in the  
fourth quarter, reversing a loss from the same period last year and 
beating Wall Street expectations as its revenue nearly tripled. 
</P>
<P>
	The popular Internet site operator reported Tuesday its earnings  
equaled 16 cents per share on a diluted basis for the quarter ended 
Dec. 31. The results compared to a loss of $1.9 million, or 2 cents 
per share, in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue soared to $76.4 million from $26.6 million as increasing  
visitors to its Web sites helped fuel advertising. The company's 
sites include a range of features from chat rooms to news and 
search services. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding costs related to acquisitions, Yahoo! earned $25  
million, or 21 cents per share -- beating analysts' estimates for 20 
cents per share, according to First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were released after stock markets closed. Earlier,  
Yahoo! stock dropped $13.37 1/2 a share to $402 as investors sold 
shares to lock in profits, but analysts expected the price to 
resume its recent climb Wednesday on the earnings news. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least they're making some money,'' said Jim Balderston,  
director of Zona Research Inc., an Internet market research company 
in Redwood City, Calif. ``Some of these Internet stocks have been 
going through the roof while continuing to pile up negative 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on what the market has been doing, this is an  
encouragement not just for Yahoo! but for a lot of Internet 
stocks,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, Yahoo! announced that Tim Koogle, president and  
chief executive officer, was appointed chairman and CEO, effective 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Mallett, the company's chief operating officer, was  
elevated to the president's post and made a board member, in 
addition to his current title. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also announced a 2-for-1 stock split, which had been  
expected by analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, Yahoo! earned $25.6 million, or 23 cents per  
share, reversing a loss of $25.5 million, or 29 cents per share, in 
1997. Revenue jumped to $203.3 million from $70.5 million.

called the doyenne of Scottish literature, died Monday the age of 
101. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause and location of her death, which occurred Monday, were  
not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	A poet and novelist, Lady Mitchison was a prolific writer --  
completing more than 80 novels in her lifetime. She never confined 
herself to one style, writing historical novels, science fiction, 
travel writing and a three volume autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
	Her first novel, ``The Conquered,'' was published in 1923 and  
was based on her wartime experiences. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1935, Lady Mitchison published her most controversial work.  
``We Have Been Wanted'' explored sexual behavior, including rape, 
seduction and abortion. The book was rejected by leading publishers 
and ultimately censored. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to her writings, Lady Mitchison was also a vocal  
women's rights campaigner, actively lobbying for birth control.

critically acclaimed novels and screenplays won him accolades from 
contemporaries including Joan Didion and Joyce Carol Oates, died 
Sunday of pulmonary complications following an illness. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore came to Hollywood to work with director Alfred Hitchcock.  
Oates once said Moore was a ``supremely entertaining `serious' 
writer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moore's first book, ``The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne''

producer for Associated Press Television News, died Sunday when 
gunmen opened fire on his vehicle at a checkpoint in this West 
African nation, torn by civil unrest between rebels and the 
government. He was 34. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are in mourning today,'' said Louis D. Boccardi, president  
of The Associated Press. He called Tierney ``a brave and 
adventurous man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ian Stewart, 32, West Africa chief of bureau, who was also in

London, where he was in stable condition Monday night. AP 
photographer David Guttenfelder, 29, was injured by flying glass. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are in awe of the sacrifices they and others make so that  
we can carry out our mission,'' Boccardi told AP staffers Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he was a cameraman, Tierney's byline appeared on a range  
of stories from Africa. He joined AP's TV arm in 1996, organizing 
coverage of a military coup in Burundi. He set up the agency's 
first TV bureau in New York before returning to Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	In January 1997, Tierney returned to Africa, based in Nairobi,  
Kenya. For the next two years he chronicled the turmoil across east 
and west Africa. He was part of an AP team that for three months 
reported exclusively on the advance of then rebel leader Laurent 
Kabila in eastern Zaire, now Congo. 
</P>
<P>
	During the assignment, he pioneered use of new technology which  
allowed video to be dispatched over a conventional satellite 
telephone. 
</P>

<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Orlandus Wilson, one of the founding voices of an  
influential gospel quartet and an institution in popular jazz 
music, died Dec. 30 at 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson and three other high school singers formed the Golden  
Gate Jubilee singers in Norfolk, Va., in 1934. The group, which 
later changed its name to the Golden Gate Quartet, went on to 
become one of the most influential gospel groups, updating 
well-known spirituals with jazz and swing. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1938, the group appeared on the program of John Hammond's  
``Spirituals to Swing'' concert at Carnegie Hall in New York City, 
earning them national recognition. In 1941, they became the first 
black singers to perform at Constitution Hall in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	They traveled to Europe in 1955, and like many other black  
musicians fed up with racism in the United States, decided to make 
it their home. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, the quartet gave its first performance in the United  
States since the 1950s when it was inducted into the hall of fame 
of United in Group Harmony, a group devoted to preserving the 
history of vocal harmony. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson managed the quartet for most of its life, but he also did  
musical arrangements and composed original works. He retired from 
the quartet in October.

<HEADLINE> Clash Over Proposed NJ Golf Course </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERSEY CITY, N.J. (AP) -- It's a developer's dream: Golfers  
teeing off on an 18-hole waterfront course, launching drives 
against the backdrop of New York City's skyline and the Statue of 
Liberty. 
</P>
<P>
	It's an environmentalist's nightmare: Two of the holes are  
planned on state-owned land, something naturalists say would chase 
away rare birds and destroy the only patch of tidal marshland 
around for miles. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed $30 million golf course on Caven Point peninsula at  
Liberty State Park is still under consideration by the New Jersey's 
Department of Environmental Protection and the National Park 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
	But the project has raised questions about Gov. Christie  
Whitman's commitment to buy or set aside 1 million acres of 
undeveloped land as open space in the nation's most crowded state. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're puzzled when a government agency under the control of  
the governor is willing to give away land that they don't have to 
go out and buy,'' said Andrew Willner, director of New York/New 
Jersey Baykeeper, a conservation organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The Park Service helped put the money up for the land when it  
was purchased in 1980. The goal was to use it as a natural area and 
for ``water-based recreation.'' But developers hoping to transform 
Jersey City's waterfront and financial districts have won the 
backing of politicians and officials looking to give Hudson County 
its first golf course. 
</P>
<P>
	A Whitman spokeswoman said the governor is open to the idea of  
leasing Liberty State Park's land and using the money to preserve 
other land. 
</P>
<P>
	Applied Companies of Hoboken already has approval to build a  
nine-hole golf course near the peninsula. But vice president David 
Barry said he can't squeeze in 18 holes without the Caven Point 
land. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have the (Hudson) river on one side and the turnpike on  
the other side,'' Barry said. ``We really need that property.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Remaud, president of the Liberty State Park Conservancy,  
said the development will cripple an ecosystem that serves as a 
feeding ground for bird and fish and an educational playground for 
6,000 schoolchildren a year. 
</P>
<P>
	A quarter-mile beach and a salt marsh border acres of ragweed  
and seaside goldenrod plants near the site. 
</P>
<P>
	All would disappear if a golf course is built, Remaud said. The  
grasses feed the northern harrier, the least tern and the 
short-eared owl, all endangered birds in New Jersey, according to 
the New Jersey Audubon Society. 
</P>
<P>
	While Barry said the course would improve the slightly  
contaminated land, Remaud said the push to develop isn't about the 
community: ``This is all about the view.''

<HEADLINE> Greenspan, Chinese Premier Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China's premier briefed Federal Reserve Chairman  
Alan Greenspan on Chinese efforts to boost growth in the face of 
economic turmoil affecting other Asian countries, state media 
reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Xinhua News Agency said Greenspan had expressed admiration  
for China's economic achievements and ``highly evaluated'' its 
contribution to the Asian and the world economy by keeping its 
currency exchange rate stable. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan was in Beijing for an afternoon of meetings on  
economic and financial issues with Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji and 
Dai Xianglong, head of the People's Bank of China. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Greenspan visited Beijing, 20 months ago, his  
discussions amounted to a high-level economics seminar. Since then, 
China has begun to reform its central bank along Western lines, but 
troubles in the banks it oversees have mounted. 
</P>
<P>
	Under central planning, the government forced state-run banks to  
lend to state industries, many of them inefficient and 
unprofitable. Western analysts estimate that about 20 percent of 
all loans are not being paid, making the state banks technically 
insolvent. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report Tuesday in the Financial News, the official  
newspaper of the People's Bank, Dai called for increasing bank 
capital and converting company debt to shares to blunt the impact 
of the bad loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Dai also recommended merging, closing down or forcing  
inefficient financial institutions to declare bankruptcy, the 
Financial News reported. He made his pleas at a meeting of 
international central bankers that Greenspan also attended in Hong 
Kong on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Will New Arkansas Gov. Shake a Leg? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Mike Huckabee, a former Baptist  
preacher sworn in Tuesday as Arkansas' governor, faced a dilemma as 
he prepared for his inaugural ball: Should he and his wife dance? 
</P>
<P>
	The question centered more on whether the governor CAN dance  
than on whether he would risk offending the state's overwhelmingly 
Baptist population. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen him dance, and I've known him 23 years. I  
don't know what kind of dancer he would be,'' said Huckabee 
spokesman Jim Harris, who is married to the governor's sister. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think his problem is that he hasn't a lot of practice,''  
said the Rev. Greg Kirksey, the president of the Arkansas Baptist 
State Convention. ``I don't think his discomfort has anything with 
his being a Baptist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Huckabee affirmed that view at his gala Tuesday night.  
</P>
<P>
	``We really wanted to (dance) but there's a little problem,''  
Huckabee said. ``We can't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Huckabee made light of the speculation surrounding whether he  
would take the dance floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may not this time, but since there's nothing wrong with it,  
four years from now, when we are in our second inauguration, we'll 
be ready. You may have to pull us off the table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The denomination has long been linked to prohibitions against  
all sorts of fun like dancing, drinking and going to the movies. 
However, individual Baptist churches can set their own rules, and 
individual members can choose whether to follow them. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirksey, holding an office once occupied by Huckabee, said the  
state's 1,400 Baptist churches had no consensus on whether the 
governor should dance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guarantee if we would have voted, it would have been a split  
vote. Baptists don't agree on anything,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the governor wants to dance, that would be just fine,''  
said the Rev. Mark Evans, Huckabee's pastor at the Church of Rock 
Creek, where the governor began his inauguration day with prayers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I say `Why not dance?''' Evans said.  
</P>
<P>
	In fact, his church teaches line dancing on Saturday nights as a  
way to bring in new people. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1990 census of 5,200 Arkansas churches showed 59 percent of  
their 1.4 million members belonged to Baptist congregations, 
according to the Association of Statisticians of American Religious 
Bodies.

<HEADLINE> Intel Profits Up 18 Pct. in Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Intel Corp.'s fourth-quarter profits rose 18  
percent to easily beat Wall Street expectations, helped by strong 
demand for its pricier microprocessors used in powerful business 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Intel cautioned Tuesday that revenue in the current  
quarter should drop from fourth-quarter levels due to a seasonal 
slump in sales of personal computers that typically follows the 
holiday buying season. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the results suggested a mixed outlook for the  
computer industry, which looks to the largest maker of computer 
chips as a broader barometer of high-tech demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel earned $2.06 billion, or $1.19 a share on a diluted basis,  
in the three months ended Dec. 26, 1998. That was up from a profit 
of $1.74 billion, or 98 cents a diluted share, in the year-ago 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose 17 percent to a record $7.61 billion from $6.51  
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Intel profit handily surpassed Wall Street forecasts for a  
profit of $1.07 a share. The results were released at the close of 
financial markets, after Intel stock fell Tuesday by $4.18 3/4 a share 
to $135.56 1/4. The drop contributed to a steep selloff on the Nasdaq 
Stock Market as traders cashed in on a record-shattering runup in 
technology stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., tied the profit gain to  
cost-cutting and strong sales of its chips, particularly its more 
profitable Xeon microprocessors used as the brains in desktop 
machines bought by businesses. A shift in Intel's sales mix toward 
the expensive processors more than offset damage to Intel's bottom 
line by sharp price cuts in its Celeron chips, which are used in 
inexpensive PCs costing $1,000 and less, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason was that Intel's sales of less profitable Celeron  
chips fell below expectations in the fourth quarter, Intel 
executive vice president Paul Otellini said in a teleconference 
with analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	Microprocessor chips made by Intel run more than 85 percent of  
the world's PCs. But Intel responded late to stiff competition from 
rivals AMD and National Semiconductor's Cyrix in supplying chips 
for the increasingly popular sub-$1,000 PCs. While now starting to 
retake market share in that market segment, Intel has been forced 
to sharply cut prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe we had taken our eye off the ball in 1998,''  
Otellini said. ``The products we launched into the channel helped 
us retake share back to our historic level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intel said its improved profitability should continue this year,  
with gross margins -- what it makes after subtracting certain 
expenses -- continuing to beat levels set earlier last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the good news,'' said Andrew Peck, an analyst with  
Cowen &AMP; Co., a Boston-based investment bank. ``The only source of 
disappointment is the company is clearly girding for a typical 
season decline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, Intel earned $6.07 billion, or $3.45 a diluted  
share, down from a profit of $6.95 billion, or $3.87 a diluted 
share. Revenues rose to $26.27 billion from $25.07 billion.

<HEADLINE> Jordan: 'Cleveland's Assassin' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Michael Jordan victimized this city as much as  
any other in the NBA. He broke the Cavaliers' hearts with The Shot. 
Then, he did it again with The Shot II. 
</P>
<P>
	Oh, he also dropped in 69 points -- a career-high -- one night  
here, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was Cleveland's assassin,'' said Brad Sellers.  
</P>
<P>
	And Sellers would know. The former NBA forward grew up in  
Cleveland rooting for the Cavs. He was also Jordan's teammate in 
Chicago for nearly four seasons, and when Jordan made The Shot to 
end the Cavs' 1989 season, Sellers made The Pass to set it up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being on his team it really didn't hurt me like it hurt my  
family,'' Sellers, who now plays professionally in France, said 
Tuesday after working out at Gund Arena. ``Because my family on one 
hand was cheering for the Cavs, but cheering for me on the other 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had some great games. You talk about rivalries, you talk  
about the Celtics-Lakers, Philly-Celtics. In it's own right, 
Cleveland and the Bulls was one in the late '80s and early '90s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the teams split the first two games of their 1989 playoff  
series in Cleveland, the Cavaliers avoided elimination by winning 
Game 4 in overtime at Chicago Stadium to force a decisive Game 5 at 
Richfield Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	With Cleveland trailing by a point in the final seconds, Cavs  
guard Craig Ehlo scored on a backdoor layup to put Cleveland ahead 
100-99. The Bulls quickly called their last timeout. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember walking to the bench, and you know what, this was  
going back and forth in a best-of-five and I was saying to myself, 
'We're finished, we just blew it right here.' There were like three 
ticks on the clock, and I thought, 'We blew it, it's over, it's 
over.''' 
</P>
<P>
	When play resumed, Sellers was surprised when Cleveland coach  
Lenny Wilkens decided to have Larry Nance, who was guarding 
Sellers, help Ehlo check Jordan and not defend the inbounds pass. 
</P>
<P>
	Sellers had five seconds to get the ball in, and as he counted  
the time down in his head, he saw that Jordan wasn't open. Neither 
was Scottie Pippen, and for an instant, Sellers thought Jordan 
wouldn't be an option. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just about ready to throw it to Craig Hodges in the  
corner, and Michael broke free,'' Sellers said. ``I saw him at the 
last second and I gave it to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cavs fans can recite what Jordan did next by chapter and verse.  
So can Sellers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He left Larry,'' he said. ``He shook Craig, got him up in the  
air. Craig tried to recover, but he just got up in the air, hung, 
and in that split second, let it go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bulls 101, Cavaliers 100. Jordan -- 44 points.  
</P>
<P>
	``As the shot went in, the one thing that I do remember was that  
the building went silent, and there were 22,000 people in there,'' 
said Sellers. ``The only section that was cheering was section 131, 
and that was the Bulls visitors' tickets, and that was all my 
family, John Paxson's family and Michael had some friends there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan did it to the Cavs again in the 1993 playoffs, draining  
an 18-footer -- Shot II -- at the buzzer as Chicago swept Cleveland 
in four straight. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan seemed to have some of his best games against the Cavs,  
scoring 69 points against Cleveland in 1990. In fact, the three 
highest-point games against Cleveland all belong to Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	Sellers said it was nothing personal, but that every time the  
Bulls came to town there was newspaper article about how Kevin 
Johnson or Ehlo or Gerald Wilkins was going to shut down Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	``This kid was well-versed in his surroundings,'' said Sellers.  
``He made a point to pick up the local newspaper and read 
everybody's comments. If somebody put a little jab in there, he 
never forgot it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Cleveland will never forget him.

It's 23 times the world record for any baseball ever sold, and five 
to six times the record of any sports artifact,'' said Arlen 
Ettinger, president of Guernsey's auction house, which held the 
special sale at Madison Square Garden.

	Iraq Appeals to Arab Nations

	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Arab nations should condemn American and  
British airstrikes and the countries that supported them, the Iraqi 
leadership said Tuesday. ``Any foreign aggression against any Arab 
country should be considered as an aggression on the Arab nation as 
a whole,'' said a statement issued after President Saddam Hussein 
met with senior government officials. The statement was the latest 
in a series of appeals to Arab states to back Iraq and get the 
United Nations to lift trade sanctions.

	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Bypassing a hostile Parliament,  
Hours after Haitian President Rene Preval told the nation he will 
create a new government by decree, motorcycle gunmen launched an 
attack Tuesday on his sister, wounding her and killing her driver. 
Two gunmen on a motorcycle opened fire at a vehicle carrying 
Marie-Claude Calvin. She was shot in the neck, chest and leg, but 
her injuries weren't life-threatening, doctors said. There have 
been no arrests in the shooting.

high-powered rifles. Anthony Jon Merlino, 21 was arrested and 
charged with grand larceny, grand theft and maiming, poisoning or 
killing another person's animal, police said. Arrest warrants on 
the same charges -- which carry combined maximum penalties in excess

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. John Kasich, the boyish-looking House

week toward seeking the Republican presidential nomination, The 
Associated Press has learned. Kasich, 46, a ninth-term House 
member, will form an exploratory committee with the Federal 
Election Commission on Wednesday, allowing him to raise and spend 
money while he tests the waters, an official involved with the 
effort said Tuesday. Kasich confidants say the lawmaker is almost 
certain to become a full-fledged candidate, but that announcement 
probably would come in the spring.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- Michael Jordan, the greatest player in NBA  
history is expected to retire at noon EST Tuesday, according to a 
source with close ties to the league. If so, it would be his second 
retirement in five years, perhaps for good this time. The Chicago 
Tribune quoted a source as saying Jordan met with a few teammates 
at his home Monday and told them the thought of playing an 
abbreviated, 50-game season wasn't enough of a challenge.

<HEADLINE> 49ers Fire Player Personnel Director </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Vinny Cerrato was fired as the San  
Francisco 49ers director of player personnel in a move that could 
signal Bill Walsh's return in a similar role. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh, the Hall of Fame coach who took San Francisco to three of  
its five Super Bowl titles, is expected to rejoin the organization 
to oversee the April draft and help in other areas of player 
personnel evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	Team officials today confirmed the dismissal of Cerrato, who had  
directed the 49ers' scouting and draft since January 1995. He 
joined the organization in 1991 as director of college scouting. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco's lack of success in the draft and free agency  
under Cerrato has prompted talk of firing for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1997 draft, with San Francisco in need of a quarterback  
of the future, the 49ers passed over Jake Plummer and used their 
top pick on Jim Druckenmiller, who didn't throw a pass this season 
and dropped to third on the depth chart behind Steve Young and Ty 
Detmer. Plummer became a starter for the Arizona Cardinals.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Friend of Clintons Retiring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGDALE, Ark. (AP) -- The lawyer who helped Hillary Rodham  
Clinton parlay a $1,000 commodities investment into $100,000 is 
retiring from as general counsel at Tyson Foods Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Blair, 63, announced Monday he had begun reducing his  
responsibilities at the poultry giant and planned to be out of the 
position next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Blair, a close friend of the Clintons, was involved in their  
investments for years, including advising them on the Whitewater 
land deal and the commodities deal that drew $100,000 for Mrs. 
Clinton in the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Blair underwent intense questioning before a federal  
grand jury looking into whether Tyson Foods provided illegal 
gratuities to Mike Espy while he was agriculture secretary in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, the Agriculture Department was considering tighter  
sanitary requirements in poultry plants. Tyson, the country's 
largest poultry company, provided Espy a plane ride, lodging and 
football tickets. Espy was indicted but was later acquitted.

<HEADLINE>  US Role in Mideast Talks May Lessen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- The United States, which brokered the  
last two interim peace agreements between Israel and the 
Palestinians, will play a much less active role in talks on a 
permanent accord, the chief U.S. negotiator said today. 
</P>
<P>
	A final peace agreement would draw the final border between  
Israel and the Palestinian entity and determine the status of 
Jerusalem, Jewish settlements and Palestinian refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Permanent status is not something that should be mediated,''  
said U.S. envoy Dennis Ross, who has spent hundreds of hours 
shuttling between Israeli and Palestinian negotiators in attempts 
to get interim peace agreements implemented. 
</P>
<P>
	In final status talks, ``the two sides are dealing with  
existential questions that must be negotiated by them,'' Ross said 
in a roundtable discussion organized by the Peres Center for Peace. 
</P>
<P>
	``They must learn to live together,'' Ross said. ``The only way  
to learn to live together is to learn to hammer out difficulties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During long deadlocks in the peace process over the past two  
years, Washington was drawn into a more direct role in negotiations 
-- drawing complaints from Israeli hard-liners that it was imposing 
concessions on Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	The most intense U.S. involvement came in October during the  
nine-day Mideast summit at Wye Plantation in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton joined Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and  
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in round-the-clock 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	In the resulting agreement, Israel promised to withdraw from 13  
percent of the West Bank by the end of January in exchange for a 
Palestinian campaign against Islamic militants. 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu froze implementation last month, arguing that the  
Palestinians violated the accord. The Palestinians denied the 
charges and said Netanyahu took the step because he faces a 
difficult campaign for re-election May 17 and wants to appease 
voters opposed to a troop withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon defended the freeze today,  
rejecting criticism from Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, who 
accused Israel on Monday of stopping the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
	``Israeli implementation will always follow Palestinian  
implementation. Unfortunately, the Palestinians are not carrying 
out their commitments,'' Sharon told Israel radio. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that instead of joining anti-Israel attacks, Moussa  
should insist that commitments be carried out. Egypt is one of only 
two Arab states at peace with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	In January 1997, the United States was also actively involved in  
negotiating the Hebron agreement that led to an Israeli troop 
withdrawal from 80 percent of the West Bank town. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States raised its profile in the negotiations after  
Netanyahu, a one-time opponent of the peace agreements, came to 
power in May 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu's dovish predecessors, Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres,  
had conducted negotiations with little outside help. 
</P>
<P>
	In describing Washington's role in final status negotiations,  
which have yet to get off the ground, Ross said today that the 
United States would try to clarify issues and intervene from time 
to time. 
</P>
<P>
	``An agreement between Israel and the Arabs will not end all  
conflicts, but once there is an Israeli-Arab agreement, extremists 
will be on the decline,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> High Court Hearing Harassment Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supreme Court justices, hearing a sexual  
harassment case that could affect schools nationwide, questioned 
Tuesday how to draw the line between children's playground taunts 
and something more sinister. 
</P>
<P>
	``Little boys tease little girls,'' said Justice Sandra Day  
O'Connor. ``Is every one of these incidents going to lead to a 
lawsuit?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In considering a case involving a fifth-grade boy in Georgia who  
groped a classmate and made crude remarks, the justices must decide 
whether schools are to blame if educators willfully ignore and do 
not stop boorish conduct between students. 
</P>
<P>
	``How does the school define ... the harassment, as  
distinguished from teasing,'' which may be widespread and based 
solely on a student's sex, Justice David Souter asked. ``In the 
first grade, boys tease girls because they are girls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several justices questioned whether the courtroom is the best  
place to settle classroom problems between boys and girls. Justice 
Stephen Breyer said school teachers, principals and psychologists 
deal with disruptive students. Courts have only lawyers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the latter group of people is the right one,''  
Breyer told a lawyer for the family of LaShonda Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl and her mother say they complained repeatedly to school  
officials in Monroe County, Ga., that a classmate known in court 
papers as ``G.F.'' had grabbed LaShonda's breasts and crotch, 
simulated a sex act and made threatening remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	The family sued the school, claiming officials did nothing to  
stop G.F. The school allegedly refused even to move the boy from 
the seat next to LaShonda, whose grades suffered during the five 
months of alleged harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	The school board said federal law does not make the school  
liable for a student's bad conduct. A federal appeals court threw 
out the family's lawsuit on the grounds that the disputed federal 
law does not cover harassment between fellow students. 
</P>
<P>
	The law, known as Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972,  
bans sexual discrimination in any educational institution that 
receives federal money. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Aurelia Davis, LaShonda's mother, and the Clinton  
administration urged the justices to reverse the appeals court 
ruling. Schools should be accountable if they deliberately ignore 
harassment that discriminates against a student by preventing 
learning, argued lawyer Verna Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it knows about it ... (a school) must take reasonable steps  
to address and remedy it,'' Ms. Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	But a lawyer for the school board said it is unfair to require  
schools to apply adult standards of conduct to children. 
</P>
<P>
	``The potential here for litigation is enormous,'' said lawyer  
W. Warren Plowden. 
</P>
<P>
	Justices Antonia Scalia and Anthony Kennedy also expressed  
doubts about how to differentiate between schoolyard teasing and 
sexual harassment, and about whether educators are responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	LaShonda, now 16 and a high school junior, sought money from the  
school district and an order keeping G.F. away from her. After 
LaShonda's mother complained to the county sheriff, the boy pleaded 
guilty to sexual battery. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision in her case  
appeared vulnerable when the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 last June that 
monetary damages could be available if a school official who had 
authority to do something ``has actual notice of or is deliberately 
indifferent'' to the harassment. That decision involved a Texas 
teacher's sexual harassment of a high school student. 
</P>
<P>
	The court is expected to decide the Georgia case by July.  
</P>
<P>
	The case is Davis vs. Monroe County Board of Education, 97-843.

<HEADLINE> Md. Gov. Fumes Over Court Backlogs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Gov. Parris Glendening said Tuesday he wants  
the state to take over Maryland's circuit court system, which is so 
backlogged that accused killers have been released because of 
delays and missing evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is simply intolerable to watch murder defendants walk free  
because the circuit court system is overwhelmed,'' Glendening said 
in a statement. ``When the system fails, justice fails.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Flowers walked out of jail Tuesday after waiting more  
than three years to be tried on charges of shooting a man in a pool 
hall. His trial had been postponed more than 17 times since his 
December 1995 arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	When Flowers, 21, finally got to court, police lost a key file  
containing the original six mug shots a witness used to pick out 
the defendant. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the file, prosecutors had no case and decided to cut a  
deal. Flowers pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and was given 
a suspended 23-year sentence, with credit for time served. 
</P>
<P>
	Police did not return several messages seeking comment Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 5, a judge threw out murder charges against four men who  
had been awaiting trial for three years for a 1995 gang killing, 
and whose cases had been postponed a dozen times. 
</P>
<P>
	Their trial had been delayed so long that it ``boggles the  
imagination'' and deprived the defendants of their constitutional 
rights, Baltimore Circuit Judge Roger Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	Court officials blame Baltimore's court backlog and crowded  
jails on drugs. Baltimore has one of the highest murder rates in 
the country, and felony drug cases nearly tripled between 1991 and 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Glendening had raised the prospect of a takeover during the 1998  
campaign. He said Tuesday he will seek legislative approval for his 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke, a fellow Democrat, and Prince  
George's County Executive Wayne Curry support such a takeover, 
which would cost an estimated $131 million each year.

<HEADLINE> Yale Professor a Suspect in Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- Yale University lecturer James Van de  
Velde was scheduled to teach courses this semester about the covert 
world of international espionage and drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
	But whispers of murder and intrigue have come to haunt the  
teacher himself: Van de Velde is a suspect in the slaying of one of 
his students. 
</P>
<P>
	Yale canceled Van de Velde's two spring semester classes, which  
were supposed to begin on Monday, saying that while Van de Velde is 
presumed innocent, his presence in the classroom would be ``a major 
distraction for students and impair their educational experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Tuesday, Van de Velde said he is cooperating with  
police investigating the stabbing death of Suzanne Jovin, a 
21-year-old political science student from Goettingen, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public announcement that I am `in a pool of suspects' in  
the murder of Suzanne Jovin is immensely upsetting,'' said Van de 
Velde, 38, referring to the wording of a statement from the 
university this week. ``Any suggestion that I had anything to do 
with the death of my former student is deeply, deeply painful and 
outrageous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jovin was stabbed 17 times in the neck and back on Dec. 4. Her  
body was discovered in a wealthy neighborhood not far from campus. 
Many faculty members -- including Van de Velde -- live in the area. 
Ven de Velde was Jovin's senior thesis adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	Some students are nervous.  
</P>
<P>
	``I had pre-registered for one of his seminars, and I redid my  
schedule. It's not the worth the risk,'' said 20-year-old Angela 
Campbell, a senior from Ainsworth, Neb. ``I would be willing to bet 
that most women who are political science majors wouldn't take his 
classes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Van de Velde has been neither arrested nor charged,  
Campbell's father ``was very adamant'' that she switch classes, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yale officials said there is no way to know how many students  
would have enrolled in Van de Velde's classes, since this week is 
the ``shopping period'' when students can attend classes without 
officially enrolling. 
</P>
<P>
	Van de Velde was supposed to teach two courses, ``Intelligence  
Collection and Analysis'' and ``International Drug Trafficking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before Van de Velde came to Yale, he worked at the Asia Pacific  
Research Center at Stanford University. He also held a fellowship 
at Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
	According to his personal Website, he served from 1989 to 1991  
as an adviser to the Bush administration on the nation's nuclear 
defense and space talks with the Soviet Union and was commissioned 
in the Naval Intelligence Reserves in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Yale professor Rogers Smith said that Van de Velde's record  
since he came to Yale in 1993 has been ``exemplary,'' but ``we do 
want to err on the side of reassuring our students that every 
precaution is being taken for their safety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van de Velde remains on the payroll but has been restricted to  
research.

<HEADLINE> Deranged Air Passenger Convicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A man who called himself Jesus and blessed  
fellow airline passengers by tapping them on the head with a pillow 
was convicted Tuesday of assaulting a flight attendant when he was 
ordered to take his seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Dean Trammel, a 22-year-old former student at Santa Monica  
Community College in California, was found guilty in a non-jury 
trial and could get up to 20 years in prison at sentencing April 9. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Catherine Blake agreed with Trammel's  
lawyers that he is mentally ill but said he knew right from wrong 
at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has shown that there was some kind of psychotic behavior  
going on,'' Blake said. ``This young man needs help and he needs 
treatment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trammel was a passenger on a US Airways flight from Los Angeles  
to Baltimore in 1997 when he began roaming the aisles and blessing 
fellow passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	He told a flight attendant that God had ordered him to remain  
standing during landing. When a crew member ordered Trammel to sit 
down, flight attendant Renee Sheffer testified, he threw Ms. 
Sheffer across two rows of seats. 
</P>
<P>
	Trammel's lawyers argued that Trammel should be found not  
criminally responsible, the equivalent of an insanity defense. 
</P>
<P>
	A psychiatrist for the defense testified that Trammel had been  
diagnosed with manic depression and was having a ``manic episode'' 
during the flight. A prosecution psychiatrist agreed only that 
Trammel had lost ``some'' touch with reality. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said it took four men to control Trammel as he  
thrashed and tried to bite those holding him. He was hogtied for 
the rest of the flight with seat belts, plastic handcuffs and an 
airline necktie.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Truth be told, Catherine Zeta-Jones likes  
being paired with older actors. 
</P>
<P>
	The 29-year-old Welsh beauty, who starred in last year's ``The  
Mask of Zorro'' with Antonio Banderas, is looking forward to being 
68-year-old Sean Connery's love interest in ``Entrapment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Sean is the sexiest man I've ever met,'' Zeta-Jones says in  
February's Movieline magazine. ``His body is so great it's 
unbelievable. ... He's intensely charismatic. I find all that 
sexy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also finds older men attractive off-screen.  
</P>
<P>
	``Older men come on to me all the time, and I'm really happy  
about that,'' she says.

<HEADLINE> Thompson Talks About Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- John Thompson isn't sure what his future holds.  
He hopes it will be in sports and he knows it won't be in politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Three days after stunning college basketball with his  
resignation as coach at Georgetown, Thompson was able to talk with 
certainty about his near future and with idealism about what's down 
the road. He said he would continue to work for Georgetown, the 
school that hired him directly from St. Anthony's High School in 
1972. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't mind shaking hands, but I don't want to be vice  
president of shaking hands either,'' he said Monday. ``I care about 
Georgetown enough and the people at Georgetown enough that I will 
do anything that's needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I resigned from coaching. I have not decided to retire. I did  
this not considering what direction I was going in, so I have to 
redefine that. I'm not going to sit around. I'll deal with what I 
have to deal with and after ... I want to refine the direction I'm 
going to go in. ... If this was something I had calculated, I could 
answer questions better, but it wasn't. So I don't know what 
direction it will be. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to land somewhere in sports, but I don't know where  
yet. I didn't know I would be at Georgetown, but the opportunity 
presented itself. I left Georgetown as quickly as I went there. I 
never sat down and plotted being a college coach. The opportunity 
presented itself. I'm in a position in my life where I don't have 
to have a job but I want to be able to reach that certain level of 
satisfaction to achieve. I don't want any job anywhere if I can't 
accomplish something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With his strong presence in the world of college athletics, the  
dedication he has shown to the causes he championed and the fact he 
has been in Washington for most of his adult life, politics would 
have to be on the list of possible occupations. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of my answers has always been that since I'm not a public  
figure, it didn't negate my ability to express myself and say what 
I say,'' Thompson said, quickly knocking down any ideas about 
politics. ``Sometimes public figures are put in a position where a 
lot of what you are is the position of the majority, and the 
majority may rule, but it's not always right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Things have already changed for Thompson. He watched both games  
the Hoyas have played, including Monday night's 71-69 loss to No. 
11 St. John's at Madison Square Garden, from luxury suites. He also 
had a whole new approach to game days. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had breakfast this morning with (sophomore swingman) Nat  
Burton and we both were very relaxed talking to each other,'' 
Thompson said a few hours before the St. John's game. ``He got 
upset when I left. He cried and he almost got me upset because 
things like that bother me. So we just sat and talked. He shared 
some of his feelings, but I was relaxed where before I would have 
been real tense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The outpouring of support for Thompson was genuine and plentiful  
after his decision to concentrate on his personal life as he goes 
through a divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	``It made me feel very gratified when you have people say things  
that are nice, some of which you never knew felt that way,'' he 
said. ``You look around and say `That was a nice thing. I didn't 
know you felt that way.' I didn't take a lot of surveys during the 
course of my career so it was very pleasing to hear people say so 
many nice things.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plans Trip to N.Y., Pa. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The day after President Clinton delivers his  
State of the Union address to Congress, he will travel to New York 
and Pennsylvania to outline his agenda directly to Americans, his 
spokesman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Accompanied by Vice President Al Gore and first lady Hillary  
Rodham Clinton, the president will visit Buffalo, N.Y., and 
Montgomery County, Pa., on the day after his Jan. 19 address in 
order ``to amplify on the themes and policies of that speech,'' 
White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman continued to bat down talk in Washington that  
Clinton might put off his annual address as long as the Senate 
trial on his impeachment is ongoing. ``The decision is firm'' for 
Clinton to make the State of the Union address on the 19th, 
Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Senate needs to take care of the business before them, but  
the agenda and the policies that the president pursues, the 
people's business, also has to go forward.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Beatle Harrison Wins Libel Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- George Harrison won a public apology and  
substantial undisclosed damages today from the publishers and 
author of a book that claimed the former Beatle demanded sexual 
favors from a young woman in return for a donation to charity. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrison brought the libel action against Random House UK Ltd.  
and author Jonathon Green over the book, ``All Dressed Up: The 
Sixties and the Counter Culture,'' published last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The allegation is untrue and the defendants now acknowledge  
this to be the case,'' Harrison's lawyer, Norman Chapman, told the 
High Court today. Harrison did not attend the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Giles Crown, the lawyer for Random House and Green, said both  
were very sorry for the damage and embarrassment they had caused. 
They agreed to pay Harrison's legal costs as well as damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Random House already had withdrawn the book.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Mulls Cost of Antitrust Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- The NCAA is trying to distribute the cost  
among its schools of the more than $67 million it must pay in an 
antitrust suit regarding coaches' earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NCAA is healthy and continues to be solvent and will get  
through this,'' Graham Spanier, chairman of the NCAA Division I 
board of directors, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``But there is no question that the legal fees and the potential  
settlement cost of this lawsuit poses a significant challenge for 
all of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. District Court jury in Kansas City, Kan., last May  
awarded $67 million in damages to about 1,900 entry-level 
``restricted earnings coaches'' in an antitrust lawsuit against the 
NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	The court ruled the NCAA acted unlawfully in capping salaries of  
entry-level coaches at $16,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the plaintiffs' lawyers' fees were calculated, the NCAA's  
financial obligation in the lawsuit amounted to around $80 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as the NCAA tries to have the damage amount reduced in an  
appellate court, it is continuing to negotiate an out-of-court 
settlement with lawyers for the coaches, said association general 
counsel Elsa Cole. 
</P>
<P>
	The last publicly reported settlement offer by the NCAA was $44  
million in October, which Cole called a ``very good offer.'' The 
coaches said they wanted $58.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	How the ultimate award will be paid has been a source of  
controversy among NCAA member colleges and was a subject of 
discussion during a session at the association's annual convention 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Small schools want big schools to shoulder most of the burden,  
but big schools say the payment should be shared equally because 
the restricted earnings rule was agreed upon by nearly all 300 
Division I schools. 
</P>
<P>
	A Division I budget subcommittee has been formed to make  
recommendations on payment methods. 
</P>
<P>
	``The range of settlement numbers that we are talking about is  
significant,'' said Lane Rawlins, chairman of the subcommittee. 
``We need to really budget this. We need to approach this in a 
budgetary way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In another matter, NCAA delegates were updated on safety  
concerns about metal baseball bats. One worry is the speed of the 
ball when hit by such a bat. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of disagreements among the NCAA divisions on which bat  
restrictions to establish and when to implement them, the NCAA 
executive committee is expected to take up the matter again 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In other action Monday, delegates in the Division III business  
meeting approved by a 232-82 vote a new method of determining 
participants in national championship tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal establishes automatic qualification for Division  
III playoffs to those teams and individuals who capture conference 
titles. 
</P>
<P>
	``This brings a focus on conference and regional play,'' said  
Division III Chair John Biddiscombe of Wesleyan University (Conn.) 
``Every conference in the country with seven or more members -- 
which meet all criteria -- will receive automatic bids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, schools could win their conference titles and still  
not get a bid to the NCAA championships.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Official Fights Allegations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- African Olympic official Jean-Claude Ganga will  
fight any attempts to oust him from the IOC in connection with the 
Salt Lake City bribery scandal, The Associated Press has learned. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not going to lay down and die,'' a knowledgeable Olympic  
source said Tuesday, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``He will 
only go if there is absolutely no other way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga, of the Republic of Congo, is among the IOC members under  
investigation for accepting cash, scholarships, medical treatment, 
gifts and other favors during Salt Lake's winning bid for the 2002 
Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	At least eight International Olympic Committee members are  
believed to have been implicated. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Pound, the IOC vice president heading the inquiry, sent  
letters this week to each member suspected of impropriety and 
demanding an explanation. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee will meet in Lausanne, Switzerland, Jan. 23-24 to  
announce its findings and take action against members found to have 
acted improperly. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC leaders say any members found guilty of corruption will be  
expelled or asked to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	The source said Ganga, who is also head of the Association of  
National Olympic Committees of Africa, expected to receive a letter 
from the investigative panel. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knows it is serious but he will fight,'' the source said.  
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with French radio last weekend, Ganga denied any  
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will not become rich because I voted for Salt Lake City,''  
he said. ``That is why I am so serene.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Repeated attempts by the AP to reach Ganga at his residences in  
Paris and Brazzaville, Congo, and ANOCA headquarters in Yaounde, 
Cameroon, were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP reported last week that Ganga made a $60,000 profit on a  
Utah land deal arranged through the Salt Lake bid committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Welch, the former bid chief, said he arranged for free  
medical care for Ganga and his mother and paid $50,000 in cash to 
Ganga to help feed hungry children in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	In the radio interview, Ganga described the real-estate deal as  
``normal'' and said it ``happened a long time after the vote. 
Therefore, it couldn't have influenced me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are certainly other larger and more important issues  
than these little questions about a real estate contract,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga also said he offered to pay for his medical treatment in  
Salt Lake but the costs were covered under an arrangement between 
the hospital and the bid committee. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not comment on the cash payments he received. Welch said  
Ganga sought the money to help children in the Republic of Congo, 
which has been ravaged by civil strife.

<HEADLINE> Only Michael Could Stop Michael </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	For a true perspective on Michael Jordan's greatness, perhaps it  
is best to begin with those he loved to beat. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a long list, filled with Hall of Famers, brilliant coaches  
and helpless defenders who learned the hard way that Jordan was 
simply the best. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Dumars, Larry Bird and Pat Riley. Craig Ehlo, Gerald Wilkins  
and Bryon Russell. Lenny Wilkens tried in vain to stop him. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, only Jordan could do that.  
</P>
<P>
	With Jordan expected to retire today after 13 seasons as the  
greatest player in the game, opponents, coaches and teammates took 
time to remember what he meant to the sport -- and wonder whether 
they would ever see the likes of him again. 
</P>
<P>
	``The greatest basketball player who ever lived is now retiring,  
and there's no replacement for Michael Jordan,'' said Dumars, whose 
``Bad Boy'' Detroit Pistons unwittingly encouraged Jordan to the 
greatness that defines him. ``I don't see anyone replacing him. No 
one should try.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His influence reached far beyond basketball, a graceful game  
that he changed, mastered and transcended. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NBA, the fans, the players, the coaches, American society  
and history are losing the greatest influence that sports has ever 
had,'' said Riley, the Miami Heat coach whose teams had some epic 
battles with Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	Bird, the Indiana Pacers coach and an old Jordan nemesis on the  
Boston Celtics, said it was ``sad for everyone to see the greatest 
basketball player in the world'' retire. 
</P>
<P>
	``There comes a time in every player's career that they have to  
make that decision, and he feels it's his time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's Chicago Bulls teammates remember the incredible  
competitiveness that drove him to six NBA championships and 10 
scoring titles. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents recall standing, slipping or sliding in dumbfounded  
amazement while His Airness worked his magic. Ehlo, Wilkins and 
Russell, victims of three of Jordan's most famous shots, will never 
live them down. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jordan says, `You're going to play me one-on-one, then this is  
what you're going to get,''' said Ehlo, who was guarding Jordan 
when he made ``The Shot'' that knocked Cleveland out of the 
playoffs in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``He scared you, he was so intense,'' said Brad Sellers, who  
passed to Jordan for that shot over Ehlo. ``... He took offense at 
the thought that one guy could hold him down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For years to come, CEOs will be counting the money he made for  
them. Youngsters will be lacing up sneakers that bear his likeness. 
Though his playing days are apparently over, his business empire 
will live on -- and perhaps grow to the epic proportions of his 
fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a man who truly, as far as I'm concerned, is the  
modern-day Babe Ruth,'' said Jerry West, the Lakers vice president 
and former NBA great. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's impact reached from pro basketball to the college ranks  
to every basketball court in America. His retirement prompts an 
array of emotions that rivals his arsenal of shots -- and agreement 
between some unlikely figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight, who coached Jordan in the 1984 Olympics, called him,  
``the best player involved in a team sport of any kind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allen Iverson, leader of the new generation of NBA stars, said,  
``His game speaks for itself. With all his off-the-court marketing 
and everything he did, it makes me want to do something like that 
in my life. He set a standard for everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one should ever forget this about Jordan: He held grudges. He  
never forgot. 
</P>
<P>
	Beaten in the playoffs by Dumars' Pistons in the late 1980s,  
Jordan learned that he had to pass more and develop an outside 
shot. He did. 
</P>
<P>
	Incensed that Wilkens, then coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers,  
refused to double-team him, he vowed to make him pay. Of course, he 
did. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael has been great for the game,'' Wilkens said. ``The  
game is going to miss him. But another young star will come along. 
They won't do it like Michael. No one can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among his amazing accomplishments, Jordan redefined how athletes  
are portrayed -- on television, on billboards, as celebrity maitre 
d's in restaurants. He is the original author of the highlight 
reel, the father of today's athlete who plays movie roles and rap 
songs when the games are over. 
</P>
<P>
	Even one of Jordan's greatest admirers believes the environment  
he's created may hurt his place in history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sports have moved into the corporate level,'' Temple coach  
John Chaney said. ``The people in the stands are reading 
newspapers, and they look up every once in a while and see a dunk. 
We've lost kids in sports. In another two or three years, you'll 
find kids wondering, `Who is Michael Jordan?' 
</P>
<P>
	``You ask any kid when was the last time he was in the house  
with Michael Jordan, actually there in the house to see him play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one understood sports as a business better than Jordan. But  
he had the presence not to let anything distract him from the pure 
competition that truly drove him. 
</P>
<P>
	Attracting rock star treatment everywhere he went, the  
basketball court was one of the few places where Jordan could be 
himself -- except for a few months in 1994, when he played minor 
league baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``At that time in his life, it seemed like baseball gave him  
more satisfaction than hitting a shot at the buzzer,'' said 
Philadelphia Phillies manager Terry Francona, who managed Jordan 
during his one minor league baseball season in Birmingham, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wasn't dominant in baseball. But when he hit an 0-2  
curveball for a game-winning hit, it was the same look on his face 
as when he won a game on a buzzer-beater.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one will ever forget that face.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Plans To Raise Oil Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraq plans to raise its daily oil output as  
other oil-producing countries are trying to cut excess global 
production and bolster sagging prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq announced Tuesday it hopes to boost production to 3 million  
barrels per day from the current 2.5 million barrels, and to 3.5 
million barrels within two years. The news helped send oil prices 
lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Faleh al-Khayat, the Oil Ministry's director-general of  
planning, said the increase was contingent upon receiving spare 
parts for the country's ailing oil industry, battered by more than 
eight years of U.N. trade sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq has complained of the slow delivery of spare parts under  
the U.N.-approved oil-for-food program, which is an exception from 
the sanctions. Special chemicals for treating crude oil already 
have started arriving in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for  
delivery of crude oil in February fell 55 cents to $12.89 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq's oil exports were banned in August 1990 as part of U.N.  
trade sanctions imposed to punish Iraq for invading Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	If sanctions are removed, Iraq can implement contracts it has  
signed with foreign firms, including Russian and Chinese, to add 
another 2.5 million barrels per day to its production, al-Khayat 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In December 1996, the United Nations implemented the  
oil-for-food program, which allows Iraq to export up to $5.2 
billion worth of oil every six months to buy food and other 
humanitarian goods. 
</P>
<P>
	Al-Khayat said even with the increased output Iraq cannot hope  
to earn $5.2 billion in six months because of weak world oil 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq's oil reserves are the world's second largest after Saudi  
Arabia. Its quota set by Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries before the invasion of Kuwait was a little more than 3 
million barrels a day.

<HEADLINE> Kings' Ferraro Has Knee Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Los Angeles Kings center Ray Ferraro  
underwent surgery to repair torn cartilage in his right knee 
Tuesday and is expected to be sidelined 4-to-6 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The surgery was performed by Dr. Ronald Kvitne of the  
Kerlan-Jobe Orthopaedic Clinic at Centinela Hospital Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferraro, 34, missed his team's last three games because of the  
injury, which he suffered Jan. 5 at Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings said Ferraro, on the injured reserve list retroactive  
to Jan. 6, is expected to make a full recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	The team also announced that center Brandon Convery and  
defenseman Sean Blanchard have been reassigned to Springfield of 
the American Hockey League. Convery, 24, has been playing for the 
Long Beach Ice Dogs of the International Hockey League and 
Blanchard, 20, for the Mississippi Sea Wolves of the East Coast 
Hockey League.

<HEADLINE> Court Rules on Airline Liability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- International air passengers cannot force  
airlines to pay damages under local laws for injuries not covered 
by a treaty on air travel, the Supreme Court ruled today. 
</P>
<P>
	The court's 8-1 decision throws out a New York woman's $5  
million lawsuit against Israeli airline El Al over a preflight body 
search in which she said she was touched inappropriately by a 
female security officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices said the Warsaw Convention treaty, which governs  
damage claims over international air travel, does not allow people 
to recover damages under local law for injuries not covered by the 
treaty itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's ruling will not affect any future cases. Last fall, the  
United States ratified a new treaty, the Montreal Protocol No. 4, 
that modifies the Warsaw Convention in a way that would preclude 
the woman's lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Writing for the court, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said the new  
treaty ``clarifies, but does not change'' the Warsaw Convention's 
exclusive coverage of such claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would be hard put to conclude that the delegates at Warsaw  
meant to subject air carriers to the distinct, non-uniform 
liability rules of the individual signatory nations,'' Ginsburg 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Tsui Yuan Tseng, a clinical nutritionist at Beth Israel North  
Medical Center in New York, was at John F. Kennedy International 
Airport in May 1993 for a flight to Tel Aviv, Israel, when she was 
taken to a security area and treated as a ``high risk'' passenger. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she was confined for more than an hour, questioned and  
touched inappropriately by a female security officer. No contraband 
was found, and she was allowed to board the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Tseng sued under New York law, saying the incident caused  
emotional injury. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge threw out the case, saying the Warsaw Convention  
did not cover her alleged injury and that she could not sue under 
local law. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled, however, that she  
could sue under New York law. The treaty precluded lawsuits based 
on local law only when bodily injury resulted from an accident, the 
appeals court said. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the Supreme Court said the 2nd Circuit court was wrong.  
Ginsburg said such a ruling would subject someone injured in an 
emergency landing to the Warsaw Convention's limits on claims for 
monetary damages, while someone merely traumatized in the same 
incident could sue under local law for unlimited damages. 
</P>
<P>
	``Courts of other nations bound by the Convention have also  
recognized the treaty's encompassing pre-emptive effect,'' Ginsburg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and  
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, 
David H. Souter, Clarence Thomas and Stephen G. Breyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice John Paul Stevens dissented, saying a treaty should not  
be interpreted to pre-empt state law unless it clearly says it 
intends to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is El Al Israel Airlines vs. Tseng, 97-475.

<HEADLINE> Rare Civil War-era Flag Recovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A rare Civil War-era American flag that  
represented a black regiment has been recovered with the arrest of 
a man authorities say is an unscrupulous dealer who tried to sell 
the artifact to an undercover FBI agent. 
</P>
<P>
	The flag represented the 12th Regiment Corps d'Afrique, one of  
the first units comprised of black soldiers in the Union army. It's 
been missing for at least 22 years after being stolen from an Army 
museum while en route to Fort Jackson, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Wilhite, of Overland Park, Kan., was arrested Monday  
after meeting with the undercover agent at a hotel. He was charged 
with interstate transportation of stolen property and theft of 
major artwork, and faces up to 10 years in prison and a $500,000 
fine if convicted. He was free on $50,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilhite, reached at his home by phone, had no comment on the  
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The flag, unveiled by the FBI Tuesday, shows signs of age --  
white splotches have faded some of the flag's blue background and 
lettering sewn in across one of the red stripes is barely visible 
from afar. 
</P>
<P>
	``The significance of the flag is that it is one of the only  
U.S. Colored troop flags in existence,'' said Steven Wright, 
curator of collections at The Civil War Library &AMP; Museum in 
Philadelphia. ``These are unbelievably rare, and absolutely 
priceless historically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities were tipped to the case by a Civil War relic dealer  
who said that Wilhite was trying to sell the flag, which possessed 
some ``problems'' with legal ownership, said Special Agent Linda 
Vizi. 
</P>
<P>
	An FBI agent posing as a buyer contacted Wilhite last month, and  
he tried to sell the flag for $28,000 plus expenses at the hotel 
Monday, Vizi said. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, Wilhite valued the flag at more than $45,000, Vizi  
said. Wright said the silk flag could fetch a six-figure sum if in 
good condition. 
</P>
<P>
	In Civil War history, there were only about 17 flags made to  
represent black regiments, said David Cole, a curator at the U.S. 
Army Center of Military History in Washington. Only five, including 
the one recovered this week, are known to be in existence. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12th Regiment of Corps d'Afrique was formed in the Port  
Hudson, La., area in 1863 by Army General Nathaniel Banks. It was 
eventually incorporated into the 50th regiment of the U.S. Colored 
Troops, when the USCT was formed in 1864.

<HEADLINE> Don't Worry, Jordan Will Be Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO -- (AP) -- So Michael Jordan is retiring from the NBA.  
</P>
<P>
	Not to worry.  
</P>
<P>
	He will be back.  
</P>
<P>
	The impulse to return might be the furthest thing from his mind  
at the moment. That's understandable. 
</P>
<P>
	But say there is something -- anything -- that Jordan cannot do  
and the brighter his insides burn to do it. The desire to be the 
best controls him at least as much as he controls it. 
</P>
<P>
	The more Jordan is missed, the more improbable a comeback seems,  
the more he is likely to attempt it. The more he is reminded that 
pro-am golf tournaments and gaming tables can't feed his 
competitive jones the way basketball can, the more he will think 
about getting his jersey down out of the rafters and trying it on 
one more time. 
</P>
<P>
	And then, he's ours again.  
</P>
<P>
	Even Larry Bird knows it.  
</P>
<P>
	Upon hearing of Jordan's plans, expected to become official at a  
news conference Wednesday, he said: 
</P>
<P>
	``There comes a time in every player's career that they have to  
make that decision, and he feels it's his time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then he added: ``We look forward to seeing him sometime in late  
March when he makes his return again in Market Square Arena.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bird, the former Celtic great and current Indiana Pacers coach,  
said nothing else that would indicate he knows any more about 
Michael's plans than the rest of us. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also knows, along with Magic Johnson, Julius Erving and a  
handful of others, how it truly feels to be like Mike. To impose 
your will on a game, a season, an adoring crowd of thousands, a 
dozen other superb athletes -- almost any time the mood strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	There are plenty of words to describe what it must feel like:  
Powerful. Exhilarating. Intoxicating. But only the most exceptional 
ever experience it. Jordan, like Muhammad Ali before him, and 
perhaps Babe Ruth before that, has been at the top of that pyramid. 
Sooner or later, he will need to take in that view again. 
</P>
<P>
	So few athletes leave their sport at the right moment that we  
should applaud whenever one does with wallet and limbs intact, with 
more years ahead than behind. 
</P>
<P>
	When Jordan left the first time, in October, 1993, there was  
something unsatisfying about it. His father had been murdered, and 
the specter of a very public trial, with all the lingering 
questions, scared him. Bird and Magic had already departed, and the 
burden of carrying an entire business on his slim shoulders was 
wearing him out. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan couldn't walk across a hotel lobby without touching off a  
mob scene. He was tired from too many postseasons, too many 
commercials and too many questions about what was riding on all 
those golf and card games he played with all those shady 
characters. 
</P>
<P>
	But remember what Jordan said? That he'd accomplished everything  
he set out to do in basketball? That all he wanted to do was watch 
the grass grow out and his kids grow up? 
</P>
<P>
	That was his pride talking. Jordan wouldn't admit anyone or  
anything could drive him from the game on anything less than his 
full terms. So he played all the golf he wanted and all the 
baseball his ego would allow, and all of a sudden, he discovered 
that maybe, just maybe, there was something left to accomplish in 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	And this is what it was: Just about everyone said he couldn't  
come back, be the same player he was and rescue the Bulls one more 
time. That was at the end of the 1994-95 season and just about 
everyone was right. Chicago and a merely mortal Jordan were 
eliminated by Orlando in the Eastern Conference semifinal. We all 
know what happened after that. He returned the following season 
better than ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The time to miss Jordan is not now. His absence will make itself  
felt soon enough. That will come some dreary winter evening when 
Grant Hill, Kobe Bryant and the few other worthwhile acts have the 
night off and Alonzo Mourning bull-rushing the basket is the best 
thing the NBA has to offer. 
</P>
<P>
	That's when the regrets will become whispers and the whispers  
will become a challenge. And Jordan will hear it, and then he will 
be ours again. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan will be 36 next month and he will not come back a second  
time without being ready. Therefore, March -- Bird's dare aside -- is 
out of the question. November, on the other hand, sounds just about 
right. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Gay Renominated for Ambassadorship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton has renominated James Hormel  
as ambassador to Luxembourg, and a White House official said 
Tuesday the administration hopes ``fairness will prevail'' in the 
new Congress so he can be approved for the job. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate last year refused to vote on the nomination of Hormel  
after several conservative Republicans accused him of promoting 
homosexual views. The White House accused lawmakers of prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
	Hormel, who is gay, was approved by the Senate Foreign Relations  
Committee, but Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., didn't 
allow his nomination to come to the floor in the face of scattered 
GOP objections. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Toiv, a White House spokesman, expressed confidence Hormel  
would be approved by the full Senate this year because a majority 
back the 66-year-old San Francisco philanthropist and heir to the 
Hormel Meat Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had the support of over 60 senators for the nomination in  
the last Congress and we felt that it was unfair that his 
nomination was not brought to the floor for a vote,'' Toiv said. 
``But we are hopeful that in the new Congress fairness will prevail 
and he will have a chance to have his nomination voted up or down. 
He is very well-qualified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hormel's renomination was first reported in Tuesday's editions  
of the San Francisco Chronicle. 
</P>
<P>
	Toiv said Hormel was among a number of renominations Clinton  
submitted to the new Congress, which began its work this month. 
</P>
<P>
	If approved, Hormel would be the first openly gay U.S. envoy.  
</P>
<P>
	Christian right groups had attacked Hormel, a vocal supporter of  
gay rights and AIDS causes, over his sponsorship of a gay and 
lesbian center at the San Francisco Public Library that bears his 
name. Republican critics called some of the material obscene and 
feared Hormel might promote a ``gay agenda'' as ambassador to the 
tiny European nation. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the Senate last year, however, Hormel said he had  
no control over the books in the library and he rejected the notion 
he would promote gay rights while representing the United States 
overseas. He also promised not to bring his partner to Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
	Hormel must go through the entire nomination process again,  
including approval at the committee level before a Senate vote.

<HEADLINE> Asia Economic Outlook Improves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- Recent signs of stability in Asia's stormy  
economies may herald a recovery, although political hazards and 
market risks could prove disruptive, economists and officials said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 1999, we are seeing the beginning of recovery in Asia,''  
said Lee Tsao Yuan, director of Singapore's think-tank Institute of 
Policy Studies. 
</P>
<P>
	Recovery is expected to be uneven, with some countries -- South  
Korea and Thailand, for example -- doing well, while nations like 
Indonesia and Malaysia may not perform as robustly, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some indications that the worst may be over for most  
of Asia,'' said Singapore Foreign Minister S. Jayakumar at a forum 
on regional economies. ``However, we expect 1999 to be a very 
difficult year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He warned that `social and political unrest is likely to  
increase in the region during periods of economic distress. 
</P>
<P>
	Political uncertainty in Indonesia and Malaysia have dogged  
those countries' efforts to boost their economies, and market 
intervention by the Hong Kong and Malaysian governments have also 
left investors wary. 
</P>
<P>
	``The temptation for Asian countries affected by the economic  
crisis to resort to protectionist and interventionist measures to 
resolve problems is great,'' Jayakumar noted. 
</P>
<P>
	Pointing to the region's improving trade balances, exchange rate  
stability, recent stock market rallies, and early signs of better 
production output in several key countries, economist Tan Kong Yam 
said these trends mean that ``overall, the economic recovery is 
likely to proceed'' this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Tan, head of National University of Singapore's Department of  
Business Policy, said he was more optimistic than the International 
Monetary Fund in their forecasts for regional countries because the 
latest data shows a marked improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	While the economies of Japan and Hong Kong will likely contract  
about 1 percent, Indonesia about 4 percent, and Malaysia about 5 
percent, ``most of the other countries -- Singapore, Philippines, 
Korea, Thailand -- are likely to get 2 to 4 percent overall growth 
this year,'' Tan said. 
</P>
<P>
	By 2001, Asia will return to a sustainable average growth rate  
of 6 to 6.5 percent, Tan predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	But a collapse in the U.S. stock market, where a large amount of  
domestic savings have been placed and where share prices have 
reached very high levels, would prevent a real recovery in Asia 
this year by dampening American consumption and world sentiment, he 
warned. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're entering a period of stabilization,'' said Neil Saker,  
director of regional economic research at brokerage SG Securities 
in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
	Large-scale foreign investment has returned to some Asian  
nations, and governments are actively reforming the finance sectors 
in Thailand, Korea, Malaysia and Indonesia, said Saker. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see growth returning to positive pretty much everywhere (in  
Asia) by the second half of this year,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pays Paula Jones $850,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton mailed a check for $850,000  
to Paula Jones on Tuesday to settle her sexual harassment 
allegations, officially ending the sensational legal battle that 
cast his presidency into crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	In the week his Senate impeachment trial was to resume, the  
president drew about $375,000 from his and Hillary Rodham Clinton's 
personal funds and got the rest of the settlement, about $475,000, 
from an insurance policy, a White House official told The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``This ends it. The check is being Fed-Exed'' to Bill McMillan,  
one of Mrs. Jones' lawyers, said the official, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The official said the personal funds were drawn from the  
Clintons' blind trust, which was valued in their financial 
disclosure statement at between $1 million and about $5 million. 
None of the money was drawn from his legal defense fund, which 
raises money from private citizens to defray his legal bills, the 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still unclear is how much money from the check will make it into  
Mrs. Jones' bank account. As the settlement was reached in 
November, Mrs. Jones still faced an outstanding claim by Joseph 
Cammarata and Gilbert Davis, the two lawyers who quit her case last 
year and filed an $800,000 lien against any settlement in order to 
collect legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's been decided yet'' how much Mrs. Jones will  
receive, said her friend and adviser, Susan Carpenter McMillan. 
``We did hear they are sending out the check. We hope to receive it 
soon,'' Carpenter McMillan said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the check ends the litigation, the fallout from the  
controversy still haunts the president. Mrs. Jones' lawsuit brought 
to light the president's affair with former White House intern 
Monica Lewinsky and set in motion a criminal investigation that 
resulted in a historic House vote last month to impeach Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The president files his trial brief on Wednesday, and House  
prosecutors on Thursday will begin presenting to the Senate their 
case that the president obstructed justice in the Jones lawsuit and 
lied about it before a federal grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton reached a settlement with Mrs. Jones on Nov. 13 after  
four years of litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Under that settlement, Clinton didn't admit any wrongdoing or  
apologize and simply agreed to make a cash settlement to Mrs. 
Jones, a former Arkansas state worker. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones alleged that Clinton, when he was governor of  
Arkansas, made a crude advance in a room at a Little Rock hotel in 
1991. Clinton has steadfastly denied her accusation. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton testified in that lawsuit on Jan. 17, 1998, and during  
questioning about his relationships with other women, denied he had 
``sexual relations'' with Ms. Lewinsky. Independent Counsel Kenneth 
Starr got permission to investigate whether Clinton was trying to 
obstruct the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was forced to acknowledge a relationship with Ms.  
Lewinsky in testimony before a federal grand jury last August. 
Starr's investigation led to a referral to the House of 
Representatives accusing Clinton of several criminal acts. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright dismissed the lawsuit  
last April 1, ruling that Mrs. Jones' allegations, even if true, 
wouldn't qualify as a case of sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	An appeal of that dismissal was pending before a federal appeals  
court when the settlement was reached.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Post Second Rally of 1999 / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices rallied for only the second time in  
1999, buoyed by the dollar's rise against the yen and a decline in 
U.S. stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 1 7/16  
points, or $14.38 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves 
in the opposite direction, fell to 5.21 percent from 5.31 percent 
late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors looked to the U.S.-backed securities as the dollar  
gained strength against the Japanese yen, reversing at least 
temporarily a slide that had seen it reach 28-month lows. 
</P>
<P>
	A declining stock market also helped to make bonds more  
attractive. The Dow Jones industrial average finished down 145.21 
at 9,474.68. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were up 3/16 to 1/4 point and intermediate maturities were up 15/32 
point to 29/32 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, rose 5.33 
points to 1,311.53. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 4.46 percent as the  
discount fell 0.03 percentage point from its Monday auction price 
to 4.36 percent. Six-month yields fell to 4.49 percent, as the 
discount fell 0.06 percentage point from its Monday auction price 
to 4.34 percent. One-year yields were 4.53 percent as the discount 
fell by .08 percentage point from late Monday to 4.33 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.56 percent from 5.38 percent late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose to 124 1/16 from 123 21/32 on Monday. 
The average yield to maturity fell to 5.20 percent from 5.22 
percent.

<P>
	CEDAR HILL, Texas (AP) -- A stuntman apparently sustained a fatal  
heart attack today when an airborne truck made a rough landing 
during the filming of an episode for the television show, ``Walker, 
Texas Ranger,'' producers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another stuntman was taken to a hospital for evaluation.  
</P>
<P>
	The incident involved a sport utility vehicle that jumped a ramp  
while being chased at Cedar Hill State Park southwest of Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Although police said the sport utility vehicle appeared to hit  
where it should have after coming off the ramp, the 49-year-old 
passenger died and the driver, 37, was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The stuntman ``died of an apparent cardiac arrest,'' CBS said in  
a news release. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are grief-stricken over our friend's sudden and tragic  
death,'' series star Chuck Norris said in the statement. ``Having 
worked with us for over 20 years on a number of films and since the 
beginning of `Walker,' we thought of him not just as an incredibly 
talented stuntman, but as family.''

<HEADLINE> Former Marathoner Jim Peters Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- British runner Jim Peters, who broke the world  
marathon record four times in the 1950s but is best remembered for 
a poignant failure in the 1954 Commonwealth Games, died Jan. 9, 
according to news reports. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports did not indicate cause of death, but a story in The  
Times of London said Peters had suffered from cancer. Reports did 
not provide details on where he died or funeral arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
	An amateur from Becontree in northeast London who balanced his  
career as an optician with an exhausting training schedule, Peters 
first broke the 26-mile marathon record in 1952 with a time of 2 
hours, 20 minutes, 42.2 seconds, and remained the world's best for 
that distance until 1958, The Times of London said. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was his collapse in the 1954 Commonwealth Games in  
Vancouver, British Columbia, that evokes the most dramatic images, 
coming after he entered the stadium at the end of the marathon with 
an astonishing three-mile lead over the rest of the field. 
</P>
<P>
	After setting his usual fast pace, despite the humidity and warm  
temperatures, the then-35-year-old was suffering from severe 
dehydration and began to stagger. He then fell more than half a 
dozen times, even crawling on all fours as he tried but failed to 
complete the last lap on the track. 
</P>
<P>
	Retiring from competition after Vancouver, Peters unexpectedly  
received a Commonwealth Games gold medal on Christmas Eve 1954, 
inscribed from Prince Philip, husband of Queen Elizabeth II: ``As a 
token of admiration to a most gallant marathon runner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just before his 80th birthday, Peters, who had battled cancer  
for several years, was touched to receive a letter of best wishes 
from Prince Philip, The Times said. 
</P>
<P>
	Peters ran in the 10,000-meter race in the 1948 Olympic Games at  
Wembley Stadium in London and finished a disappointing ninth. 
Afterward, he was convinced by his new coach, ``Johnny'' Johnston, 
to become a marathoner. 
</P>
<P>
	He broke the world record in 1952, but dropped out of the 1952  
Helsinki Olympic Games marathon with severe cramps. He had his 
finest year in 1953, winning four top-class marathons and reducing 
the world record twice more. 
</P>
<P>
	Peters is survived by his wife, Frieda, a daughter and a son.

<HEADLINE> Judge To Investigate Babbitt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, in trouble  
with a judge for his department's delay in turning over Indian 
trust records, overhauled the office in charge of the accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	But the trust office's director, Paul Homan, resigned in  
protest, accusing Babbitt of undermining his authority. And now 
U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth, who has been threatening to 
hold Babbitt in contempt, says he's going to look into the 
reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't you think Mr. Homan's resignation flies in the face of  
the secretary's contention that he's acting in good faith?'' the 
judge asked government lawyers at the opening of a contempt hearing 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Homan, a former bank executive and federal bank regulator, was  
in charge of cleaning up nearly $3 billion in funds held for tribes 
and individual Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	The Interior Department is being sued over its admitted  
decades-long mismanagement of the Indian trust funds, and the 
government lawyers said Babbitt's reorganization of the trust 
office showed he was dealing with the problem. His actions included 
reassigning the top record-keeping official. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you've got a football team that isn't winning, sometimes  
the coach has got to go,'' said Justice Department lawyer Phillip 
Brooks. ``The secretary is entitled to pick his coach, because he's 
in trouble here and he's entitled to try and fix it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lamberth last month lost patience with delays in producing  
canceled checks and other account records for the lawsuit's five 
lead plaintiffs and he ordered the contempt hearing for Babbitt and 
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing is expected to take a week. It isn't clear whether  
Babbitt, who appears to be the judge's main concern, will be forced 
to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamberth said he would subpoena Homan to testify about Babbitt's  
actions. 
</P>
<P>
	The funds include 300,000 accounts held by individual Indians  
worth $500 million and an additional 2,000 tribal accounts. The 
lawsuit focuses on the individual accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	The special trustee's office is responsible for handling the  
money and improving the accounting system. Leases and other records 
necessary for reconciling the accounts are scattered around the 
country in various Bureau of Indian Affairs offices. 
</P>
<P>
	Homan was appointed to his post in 1995 under a set of  
congressionally ordered reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the judge, the trust office's advisory board said  
Homan's departure would ``undoubtedly curtail progress on the 
reforms.'' Homan ``has fought an uphill battle'' within Babbitt's 
department because of a lack of cooperation, the letter said.

<HEADLINE> Jets' Offense Deserves Credit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- Among the many huge tasks facing Bill  
Parcells when he became coach of the woeful New York Jets was 
revamping the offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
	Make that rebuilding the darn thing.  
</P>
<P>
	When the Jets were 1-15 two years ago, prior to Parcells taking  
over, the line was in shambles. Even last season, a 9-7 campaign 
that was New York's best record since 1986, the blockers weren't 
anything special. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an area that needed attention,'' Parcells admitted  
early in this special season that has brought the Jets (13-4) to 
Sunday's AFC championship game in Denver. ``So we tended to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells was happy with left tackle Jumbo Elliott, who played  
for him on the Giants when they won the 1990 title. He felt Matt 
O'Dwyer would continue to improve at right guard. 
</P>
<P>
	That left three holes.  
</P>
<P>
	``My No. 1 priority in the offseason was to try to get a  
center,'' said Parcells, who let incumbent Roger Duffy leave for 
Pittsburgh as a free agent. ``The opportunity to get someone at 
that position is minimal. There's not usually many coming out of 
the draft, and they are inexperienced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there was a solid, experienced center in Seattle, Kevin  
Mawae, who was a free agent. Parcells made Mawae the richest center 
in the league with a five-year, $16.8 million deal that included a 
$5 million bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be able to get Kevin, a good player with enough NFL  
experience, was a big advantage for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mawae was a second team All-Pro and the leader of the line. His  
biggest contribution came against massive defensive tackles such as 
Buffalo's Ted Washington and Seattle's Cortez Kennedy, the kind who 
dominated the Jets in '97. 
</P>
<P>
	Next in was left guard Todd Burger, signed away from Chicago as  
a free agent. He struggled early and nearly was benched, but came 
on down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had some adversity early in year, but he has toughness and  
hung in there,'' Parcells said. ``He has to try to be technically 
perfect. If he puts himself in the right positions, he is very 
strong and hard to overpower.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burger was perfect in one area.  
</P>
<P>
	``Burger had no penalties at all, which is quite an  
accomplishment,'' Parcells said. ``I tease him about that: `Maybe 
you can't get close enough to hold them.''' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Dwyer matured at right guard, although he still has problems  
with his temper. In his first three seasons, O'Dwyer built a 
reputation as a dirty player, and drew too many penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	``Matt has had a solid year, and he's grown as a player,''  
Parcells said. ``He's learned to channel things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott, the object of many of Parcells' barbs, also is one of  
the coach's favorites. Elliott rolls his eyes when asked about 
getting needled by his boss. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've developed a thick skin,'' Elliott said. ``I know what  
he's trying to do is get you to play your best. Some guys he 
figures can take it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells hasn't quite figured out the approach with rookie Jason  
Fabini -- other than to let the kid play. 
</P>
<P>
	Fabini, a fourth-round draft pick from Cincinnati, has been a  
blessing for the line. His cool demeanor, on and off the field, 
belies an aggressive nature when blocking. Although he's committed 
a few costly penalties, his work in his first NFL season has been 
impressive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Technically, this kid is pretty well-advanced for a young  
player,'' he said. ``He has pretty good technique, and was taught 
well in college on some things. There are some other things he 
needs to work on, and he's doing that. He's extremely bright.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So is the outlook on the line.

<HEADLINE> D-Backs Sign Pitcher Castillo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The Arizona Diamondbacks signed right-handed  
pitcher Frank Castillo to a minor-league contract on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Castillo, 29, was 3-9 with a 6.83 earned run average as mostly a  
starter with the Detroit Tigers last season. 
</P>
<P>
	With six starters already on their roster, the Diamondbacks  
likely would use Castillo in the bullpen. In eight games as a 
reliever, Castillo had a 1.13 ERA, tops among relievers with at 
least 24 innings pitched. He got his first professional save on 
Sept. 22 in Kansas City, pitching four perfect innings and striking 
out five of the 12 batters he faced. 
</P>
<P>
	Castillo, whose offseason home is in nearby Cave Creek, Ariz.,  
has a 56-74 record in eight major-league seasons, six with the 
Chicago Cubs. He was traded by the Cubs to Colorado midway through 
the 1997 season, finishing 6-3 with the Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
	He signed with Detroit as a free agent last year.  
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks said Castillo would be invited to major-league  
spring training as a non-roster player.

<HEADLINE> Colorado Ballot System Struck Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today struck down Colorado's  
preferred method of regulating voter initiatives, ruling 
unconstitutional three provisions it found ``excessively 
restrictive of political speech.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Providing important new guidelines for other states as well, the  
court said Colorado went too far in regulating the circulation of 
petitions for such measures. 
</P>
<P>
	About half the states allow ballot initiatives, and voters  
increasingly are using them to bypass legislatures and make law. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, the court said states may not require:  
</P>
<P>
	--People who circulate petitions be registered to vote.  
</P>
<P>
	--Petition circulators to wear badges bearing their names and  
identifying them as ``paid'' or ``volunteer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Initiative backers to file monthly reports with state officials  
identifying paid petition circulators and how much they were paid. 
</P>
<P>
	``The First Amendment requires us to be vigilant in making these  
judgments,'' Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote for the court, ``to 
guard against undue hindrances to political conversations and the 
exchange of ideas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said the invalidated provisions ``are not warranted by the  
state interests -- administrative efficiency, fraud detection, 
informing voters -- alleged to justify those restrictions.'' 
Ginsburg said Colorado may, and does, employ other methods to serve 
those purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote to strike down the badge-wearing requirement was 8-1,  
with only Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist saying the restriction 
should be upheld. The vote to strike down the other two 
requirements was 6-3, with Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Stephen 
G. Breyer joining Rehnquist as dissenters. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Ginsburg in voting against each of the requirements were  
Justices John Paul Stevens, Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, 
David H. Souter and Clarence Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	All three requirements had been invalidated by the 10th U.S.  
Circuit Court of Appeals after they were challenged by a group of 
state residents and a public interest group, the American 
Constitutional Law Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado's attempt to reverse the appeals court ruling got a  
frosty reception when the case was argued before the justices in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
	In Colorado, supporters must collect signatures amounting to at  
least 5 percent of the total votes cast in the most recent race for 
secretary of state to get a measure on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	After a record 10 initiatives were placed on the state's ballot  
in 1992, the Legislature passed a law that imposed various 
requirements -- including the three at issue in today's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado earlier had reacted to ballot initiatives begun by  
commercial interests, such as backers of legalized gambling, by 
banning paid petition circulators. The nation's highest court 
struck down that ban in 1988, ruling that it interfered too much 
with ``core political speech.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Buckley vs. American Constitutional Law Foundation,  
97-930.

<HEADLINE> Aetna To Allow Members To Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Don't trust your HMO to make objective decisions  
about your need for medical services? 
</P>
<P>
	Your health plan understands.  
</P>
<P>
	Aetna-U.S. Healthcare on Tuesday became the latest and largest  
health plan to allow consumers to appeal denials of insurance 
coverage to independent physicians. Poised to become the nation's 
biggest HMO with its proposed purchase of Prudential Health Care, 
Aetna said it will be bound by the decisions of the external review 
committees. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups praised Aetna's new policy, which starts in  
July, because it shows the HMO is placing medical concerns over the 
need to contain costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a great move,'' said Charlie Inlander, president of  
the People's Medical Society, a national consumer health group 
based in Allentown, Pa. ``It's something consumers have wanted for 
long time,'' he said. ``It shows health care consumerism is really 
working.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna has about 6 million HMO members, and would add another 2.7  
million members with its purchase of Prudential. Eighteen of the 30 
states where Aetna operates-- including Florida, Pennsylvania and 
New Jersey -- already have laws that give HMO members the right to 
appeal to outside review panels. 
</P>
<P>
	For nearly a decade, the federal government has let Medicare HMO  
members appeal coverage decisions to an independent review board. 
President Clinton proposed a nationwide HMO external review system 
last year as part of his ill-fated HMO consumer protection bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to respond to the outcry of HMO bashing, at least a dozen  
health plans have already adopted external appeals programs. But 
while consumers clamor for reforms, few actually seek the outside 
reviews. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, HealthNet, a California HMO with 2.3 million  
members, said of the 350 appeals its internal grievance system 
receives each month, only 20 move on to appeal to an external 
review organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``From our point of view, it shows our medical directors are  
making good decisions,'' said Ron Yukelson, HealthNet spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups were cautious about some aspects of Aetna's  
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, while consumers often complain about their HMOs,  
only a small percentage actually appeal decisions to the boards. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer groups said the plan will work only if patients  
know about it and can easily access it. Aetna promises to heavily 
promote the option, which is available only after a patient has 
gone through the company's internal appeals system. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, who chooses the review organization could be  
problematic. In some states such as New Jersey or Pennsylvania, 
state law requires the state to choose the review board. Where no 
such regulation exist, Aetna will pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna will pay the cost of the reviews -- which can range from  
$250 to several thousand dollars-- except in those states which 
require consumers to pay a small filing fee. 
</P>
<P>
	Once all necessary information is submitted, external reviews  
will be decided within 60 days, though quicker responses will be 
available in urgent cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe external review will bring a new degree of trust  
into the relationship among physicians, members, and the health 
plan,'' Dr. Arthur Leibowitz, Aetna's chief medical officer, said 
Tuesday. ``This policy not only reaches out to protect the 
interests of the member involved in a specific case, but... it will 
help us gain greater understanding about how managed care can work 
best for the consumer.''

<HEADLINE> Doomsday Cult Shuns Family Contact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- For three days, Anne Biondo waited in a lobby in  
hopes of talking to her daughter, one of 14 doomsday cult members 
holed up in a downtown hotel following their deportation from 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Like other relatives of the Concerned Christians, Biondo left  
Denver on Monday without seeing her daughter. But she took away a 
sliver of comfort when Anne-Marie Malesic sent down a scribbled 
note with a hotel staffer reading ``I love you, Mom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the cult arrived home in Denver on Saturday after  
they were deported from Israel for allegedly planning to start a 
gun battle in the streets of Jerusalem to prompt the second coming 
of Christ. No charges were filed. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver police escorted the cult members off their plane at  
Denver International Airport and whisked them away in a bus, 
enabling them to avoid their relatives waiting at the terminal 
gate. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives had kept vigil in the hotel lobby since the cult  
members returned, but on Monday left to return to their homes 
across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Sherry Clark, a spokeswoman for the family members, said they  
returned home because of family and job pressures, noting many 
spent hundreds of dollars to travel to Denver on the chance they 
could see relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the note from Ms. Malesic to her mother was the first  
communication from the daughter to the mother in more than a year 
and a half. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sort of an unexpected thing for a family member (in a  
cult) to break through and say they love their mother,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the cult members did not have direct contact with  
relatives, a Denver policeman said cult leader Monte Kim Miller has 
repeatedly called his followers at the hotel. The whereabouts of 
Miller, who was not among those arrested in Israel, were unknown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't really tell you how, but I know without a shadow of a  
doubt, he has been calling them several times since they've been at 
the hotel,'' said Mark Roggeman, a Denver police officer who 
monitors the sect. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday afternoon, police Detective Tom Fisher drove four cult  
members to a Department of Motor Vehicles office to obtain 
duplicates of their driver licenses, confiscated in Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventy-eight Concerned Christian cult members sold their  
belongings and abandoned their Denver homes and jobs in October and 
left without telling family members where they were going. 
</P>
<P>
	The only contact in the months that followed was sporadic  
telephone calls or e-mails to friends and relatives.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals Sign Outfielder Bragg </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The St. Louis Cardinals added depth to their  
outfield Tuesday, signing Darren Bragg to a one-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Bragg hit .279 last season for Boston, with eight homers and 57  
RBIs in 129 games. He became a free agent last month after the Red 
Sox failed to offer him a contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bragg fills our need for a versatile fourth outfielder,''  
general manager Walt Jocketty said. ``He's an exciting player who 
can play all three outfield positions and his hustling style of 
play can be infectious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bragg will likely see plenty of playing time backing up rookie  
J.D. Drew in left, Ray Lankford in center and free-agent 
acquisition Eric Davis in right. Davis, 36, has a history of 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals also have Willie McGee, 40, as a backup  
outfielder, but he's being counted on more as a pinch hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	For his career, Bragg is a .261 hitter with 30 homers and 175  
RBIs in 469 games. He has hit more than 25 doubles in each of the 
past three seasons, including 29 in 1998.

</P>
<P>
	The Great One, who played in his first all-star game in 1979-80,  
was among several stars added to the North American squad Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Goaltender Ed Belfour, center Mike Modano and defenseman Darryl

<P>
	Right-winger Mark Recchi of Montreal, right-winger Theoren  
Fleury of Calgary and goaltender Curtis Joseph of Toronto were the 
only players chosen from Canadian-based teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Other forwards added to the North American side that will oppose  
the World Team are Eric Lindros and John LeClair of Philadelphia, 
Jeremy Roenick and Keith Tkachuk of Phoenix, Keith Primeau of

<HEADLINE> Teen `Oprah' Hero Shot To Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- A teen-ager who was celebrated as a hero on  
``The Oprah Winfrey Show'' three years ago was shot to death in 
what relatives believe was an attempt to rob a drug house. 
</P>
<P>
	Lafayette Clark, 17, was slain Sunday night. Another teen-ager  
was wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Police are investigating, but Clark's mother, Lorraine Allen,  
said: ``He didn't agree with people doing drugs. ... I think he was 
going to take their money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She added, ``We lost control.''  
</P>
<P>
	When he was 14, Clark saw a boy being kidnapped and chased the  
car. He wrote down its license plate number, the house it stopped 
at, descriptions of the man and the boy, and went to police, 
thwarting the abduction. 
</P>
<P>
	Police gave him an award. Ms. Winfrey showcased him. Officers  
wanted him to join their ranks, but he said he planned on becoming 
an architect. 
</P>
<P>
	But kids made fun of him for helping police, and he began acting  
tougher, his mother said. His father drifted off, leaving Ms. Allen 
to raise Clark and six other children, she said. A police mentor 
failed to materialize, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time of Sunday's shooting, Clark had fathered two  
children and had a third on the way, all by different women, 
relatives said. He had a police record, had been shot by a robber 
and had stopped going to school. 
</P>
<P>
	When Ms. Allen moved to Green Bay, he stayed in Milwaukee with  
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never gave up on him,'' said his uncle, Darron Reed, who  
said he tried to keep Clark on the right track and often took him

<HEADLINE> Teammates, Opponents Discuss Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Everywhere he went, every time his famous hands gripped a  
basketball, Michael Jordan left memories behind. 
</P>
<P>
	With Jordan expected to retire from the NBA on Wednesday after  
13 seasons as the greatest player in the game, opponents, coaches 
and teammates took time to remember what he meant to the sport and 
wonder whether they would ever see the likes of him again. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NBA, the fans, the players, the coaches, American society  
and history are losing the greatest influence that sports has ever 
had,'' said Miami Heat coach Pat Riley, whose teams had some epic 
battles with Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Bird, the Indiana Pacers coach and an old Jordan nemesis  
on the Boston Celtics, said it was ``sad for everyone to see the 
greatest basketball player in the world'' retire. 
</P>
<P>
	``There comes a time in every player's career that they have to  
make that decision, and he feels it's his time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's Chicago Bulls teammates remember the incredible  
competitiveness that drove him and how he made them believe he 
could take them anywhere. He almost always did, winning six NBA 
championships and 10 scoring titles. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents recall standing, slipping or sliding in dumbfounded  
amazement while His Airness worked his magic on the court. Craig 
Ehlo, Gerald Wilkins and Bryon Russell -- victims of three of 
Jordan's most famous shots -- will never live them down. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jordan says, `You're going to play me one-on-one, then this is  
what you're going to get,' '' said Ehlo, who was guarding Jordan 
when he made ``The Shot'' that knocked Cleveland out of the 
playoffs in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``He took offense at the thought that one guy could hold him  
down,'' said Brad Sellers, who passed to Jordan for that shot over 
Ehlo. 
</P>
<P>
	CEOs will be counting the money he made for them for years to  
come, just as youngsters will be lacing up sneakers that bear his 
likeness. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a man who truly, as far as I'm concerned, is the  
modern-day Babe Ruth,'' said Jerry West, the Lakers vice president 
and former NBA great. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan was so good, seeing him once was never enough.  
</P>
<P>
	``I played against him, but at night I'd watch his highlights to  
see how well he did,'' Philadelphia 76ers guard Allen Iverson said. 
``His game speaks for itself. With all his off-the-court marketing 
and everything he did, it makes me want to do something like that 
in my life. He set a standard for everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most agree it will never be reached.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to miss him, but he's leaving on his terms,'' said  
Grant Hill of the Detroit Pistons. ``He's leaving with 
championships. He's leaving with a ton of accomplishments. But the 
NBA will be all right. I think the league will survive without a 
dominant, Michael Jordan-type player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players like Iverson, Hill and Kobe Bryant of the Lakers give  
the NBA hope for the uncertainty of the post-Jordan era. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel responsible as a young player to try to carry on the  
tradition that he and other players have developed, both on and off 
the court,'' Bryant said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's impact reached from pro basketball to the college ranks  
to every basketball court in America. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player ever,'' said  
Indiana coach Bob Knight, who coached Jordan in the 1984 Olympics. 
``He was also the best player involved in a team sport of any kind. 
Of all the great players, he knew when to retire. And he was able 
to retire on top. I'm pleased for him that he did this his way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While his playing career appears over, his retirement hardly  
puts an end to the Jordan empire. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he won the Naismith and the Wooden Award in 1984, he came  
back and said to me, `They're going to name a shoe after me,''' 
said Buzz Peterson, the Appalachian State basketball coach who was 
Jordan's teammate and roommate at North Carolina. ``And I said, 
`Now, come on, Michael. They make shoes for Larry Bird and Magic 
Johnson. What makes you think they're going to name a shoe after 
you?' 
</P>
<P>
	``And he said, `I'm telling you. It's time to buy some stock in  
Nike.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The court was one of the only places where Jordan could relax  
and be himself -- except for a few months in 1994, when he played 
minor league baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``At that time in his life, it seemed like baseball gave him  
more satisfaction than hitting a shot at the buzzer,'' said 
Philadelphia Phillies manager Terry Francona, who managed Jordan 
during his one minor league baseball season in Birmingham, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wasn't dominant in baseball. But when he hit an 0-2  
curveball for a game-winning hit, it was the same look on his face 
as when he won a game on a buzzer-beater.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one will ever forget that face. Among his amazing  
accomplishments, Jordan redefined how athletes are portrayed -- on 
television, on billboards, as celebrity maitre d's in restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	Bird, who watched Jordan score a playoff-record 63 points  
against his Celtics in 1986, couldn't resist sending him off with a 
sarcastic quip. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look forward to seeing him sometime in late March when he  
makes his return again in Market Square Arena,'' Bird said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, of course, always kept everybody guessing.

<HEADLINE> Scrabble Tiles Being Made in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- Scrabble letter tiles, which had been  
produced exclusively in Vermont, are now being made in China, a 
company spokesman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bauhinia Limited Co. of Hong Kong is making the wooden game  
tiles and tile racks at its plant in Shanghai, China, Hasbro 
spokesman Mark Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasbro is looking for a supplemental vendor in the United  
States, Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
	For 20 years, Milton Bradley Wood Products Co. in Fairfax  
produced the tiles and trays. Hasbro closed the plant Dec. 4, 
costing 87 people their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasbro has closed five of its toy and game manufacturing plants  
around the world. The move is expected to save the company $350 
million before taxes within five years.

<HEADLINE> Stuntman Killed on Norris' Set </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CEDAR HILL, Texas (AP) -- A veteran stuntman died Tuesday during  
the filming of a dangerous car chase for an episode of the 
television show ``Walker, Texas Ranger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Charles Skeen apparently suffered a fatal heart attack  
when the GMC Suburban in which he was riding made a rough landing 
after hurtling 140 feet through the air in a state park, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It flew through the air like an eagle and didn't do anything  
weird,'' said police Lt. Rick Sullivan. ``But that sucker hit and 
it hit hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The driver of the Suburban, which was specially rigged for  
safety, was taken to a hospital for evaluation of head and neck 
injuries, Sullivan said. The stuntman, 37, who asked that his name 
not be released, was in fair condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Skeen, 49, of Greenville, died ``of an apparent cardiac  
arrest,'' CBS said in a release. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point in time, we don't know whether or not his death  
was a result of the event or whether or not his death was the 
result of a possible historical medical problem,'' Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Walker star and executive producer Chuck Norris  
said: ``We are grief-stricken over our friend's sudden and tragic 
death,'' 
</P>
<P>
	The episode was being filmed at about 10:20 a.m. on a winding  
road in Cedar Hill State Park, located in rugged terrain about 15 
miles southwest of Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	As three cameras recorded the stunt, the Suburban was launched  
from a specially-constructed ramp at 35 mph and slammed down in a 
grove of small hackberry and locust trees. 
</P>
<P>
	A review of the videotapes showed that the stunt appeared to  
have gone as planned, although the truck hit hard enough to break 
the front axles, Sullivan said.

<HEADLINE> Stage Set for Impeachment Drama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House impeachment team readied opening  
arguments on Tuesday for President Clinton's Senate trial, while 
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart ridiculed their written filings 
as ``overblown rhetoric'' alleging sinister plots. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll leave the invective to Mr. Lockhart,'' retorted Rep.  
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the point man in the case against the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	With the trial to resume at 1 p.m. EST on Thursday, Lockhart  
also told reporters Clinton intends to stay busy on other matters 
while the proceedings unfold in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The president will deliver his State of the Union speech before  
a joint session of Congress on Jan. 19, for example, and travel to 
Buffalo, N.Y., and Montgomery County, Pa., outside Philadelphia, 
the following day to tout his domestic agenda. According to a 
tentative schedule released in the Senate, Clinton's attorneys 
would be presenting his defense both days. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton stands accused of perjury and obstruction of justice in  
the two articles of impeachment that cleared the House last year. 
His Senate trial is only the second such presidential proceeding in 
American history, 131 years after Andrew Johnson was acquitted in 
1868. 
</P>
<P>
	House officials have until noon on Wednesday to turn over the  
written record in Clinton's impeachment case. Democratic sources, 
who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they would carefully 
scrutinize the submission to make sure it did not include material 
that is irrelevant to the two articles of impeachment passed by the 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential allies are prepared to object if they believe the  
House has included material that was not part of the two articles, 
these sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	They added that Abbe D. Lowell, the lead lawyer for House  
Judiciary Committee Democrats during proceedings in the House, had 
met with Senate Democratic aides recently and would be reviewing 
the material. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican members of the House Judiciary Committee will present  
the case for Clinton's removal from office. Pending last minute 
changes, Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois will make brief opening 
comments, followed by Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, who 
will speak for about an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Republicans, including Reps. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas,  
James Rogan of California and Ed Bryant of Tennessee, will detail 
the evidence, after which Rep. Bill McCollum of Florida is expected 
to deliver a summary. 
</P>
<P>
	Reps. Bob Barr of Georgia, Chris Cannon of Utah, George Gekas of  
Pennsylvania, and Steve Chabot of Ohio will discuss the laws 
governing perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Reps. Charles Canady of Florida, Lindsey Graham of South  
Carolina and Steven Buyer of Indiana will address the issues of 
impeachable offenses, and either Hyde or Rogan, a former 
prosecutor, will make closing arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate schedule sets aside 24 hours for the House to make  
its case -- three eight-hour days, for example -- to be followed by 
24 hours for the White House to present its defense. Afterward, the 
Senate will have 16 hours to pose questions to the two sides. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a tentative calendar, that takes up the time through  
Saturday, Jan. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	At that point, the White House or a Senate Democratic ally is  
expected to seek dismissal of the charges, and the House is 
expected to counter with a request for witnesses, with no firm 
expectation of how long that takes. 
</P>
<P>
	Few, if any, senators are predicting that Clinton will be  
stripped of the presidency -- a step that requires a two-thirds 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	And Lockhart was biting during the day in comments made about a  
lengthy trial brief submitted by House prosecutors on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is at times a hallmark of what's a weak factual and  
constitutional case that the allegations continue to shift, and 
that the rhetoric continues to be overblown,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I mean, I think there is overblown rhetoric in there about  
sinister plots, and I think that it detracts from the argument they 
are trying to make,'' he added.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks End Lower / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks dipped today as investors eagerly gleaned  
profits from the bullish New Year markets. The soaring technology 
sector was hardest hit. 
</P>
<P>
	In late trading on Wall Street, the technology-heavy Nasdaq  
index was sharply down 63.59 at 2,321, while the Dow Jones 
industrial average was down more than 146 at 9,473. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the enormous run we've had, with the frenetic movement  
in some of thes technology and Internet stocks, I consider this 
99.999 percent profit-taking,'' said Charles Pradilla, chief 
investment strategist at Cowen &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very normal pullback,'' he added. ``A lot of portfolio  
managers think maybe the market is ahead of itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Internet and technology stocks have been the big winners on Wall  
Street this year, and those gains have pushed the Nasdaq up more 
than 8 percent since the start of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	But investors today decided to take profits on many of those  
stocks that have been flying high in 1999. Among the biggest losers 
were Amazon.com, which fell 20 5/8 to 164, and Lycos, which was down 
26 3/4 at 104 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! and Intel also sank ahead of their fourth-quarter  
earnings reports due out later today. Investors believe both 
companies will report strong profits, but some now worry that their 
earnings expectations may have risen too high. Yahoo! was down 13 3/8 
at 402. Intel was off 4 3/16 at 135 9/16. 
</P>
<P>
	``These stocks have had such a tremendous run that investors are  
taking the chance to reassess,'' said Ronald Hill, a partner with 
Brown Brothers Harriman &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow also lost ground after gaining 5 percent last week but  
falling 23.43 on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some traders believed that investors were concerned about the  
dollar, which reached a 28-month low against the yen on Monday but 
rallied today on reports of Bank of Japan intervention. A strong 
dollar has helped to keep inflation at bay in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Prairie View Decides To Stay in SWAC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRAIRIE VIEW, Texas (AP) -- Prairie View A&AMP;M officials said the  
school is staying in the Southwestern Athletic Conference even 
though they disagree with the punishment imposed because of the 
marching band 
</P>
<P>
	Prairie View president Charles Hines is asking SWAC officials to  
reconsider sanctions levied against the school after its band 
ignored a two-game suspension for getting into the fight with band 
members from Southern University, the Houston Chronicle reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prairie View intends to remain a member of the conference, and  
is committed to the promotion of good sportsmanship and cooperation 
with conference members,'' Hines wrote in a letter last week to 
William Harris, president of Alabama State University, another SWAC 
member. 
</P>
<P>
	The sanctions, which included a $31,000 fine, stem from Prairie  
View violating a two-game suspension after the band brawl during a 
football game last September. Southern's band complied with its 
two-game suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	The fine was paid but an unidentified source told the Chronicle  
last month that Prairie View was considering leaving the sports 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	A call to league offices was not immediately returned to The  
Associated Press. A call to Prairie View was referred to the Texas 
A&AMP;M University System offices in College Station. 
</P>
<P>
	System spokeswoman Terri Parker said it is believed Prairie View  
will remain in the SWAC. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the intention is that they will stay,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Ariz. Dr. Indicted in Patient Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- A doctor was arrested Tuesday on a manslaughter  
charge stemming from the death of a woman who suffered a punctured 
uterus during an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. John Biskind, who had been under investigation for months  
and had surrendered medical licenses in Arizona and Ohio following 
a subsequent botched abortion on a teen-ager, was indicted Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Also indicted was Carol Stuart, the administrator at the now  
closed A-Z Women's Center, the clinic where Lou Anne Herron bled to 
death while under Biskind's care April 17. 
</P>
<P>
	``The conduct by Dr. Biskind is so outrageous it shocks the  
conscience,'' Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley said as he 
released the indictments. 
</P>
<P>
	Biskind has previously denied any wrongdoing. Biskind's attorney  
was out of his office late Tuesday and could not be reached for 
comment by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Both were being held Tuesday in lieu of $250,000 bond each. They  
could face anything from probation to 12 1/2 years in prison if 
convicted on the charge. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy found that Herron, 33, had suffered a ruptured uterus  
during the late-term abortion. According to investigators, 
paramedics summoned by clinic staff found her lying on 
blood-drenched sheets. She had apparently already been dead for 
some time. 
</P>
<P>
	Romley said Stuart had been indicted because she played an  
active role in the abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	About two months later, Biskind again came under scrutiny after  
another abortion attempt ended with a 17-year-old patient giving 
birth to a full-term baby girl. 
</P>
<P>
	The baby survived the June 30 abortion attempt with a fractured  
skull and lacerations. 
</P>
<P>
	Biskind reportedly had a test showing the teen pregnant for  
about 23.6 weeks. She actually was 37 weeks along.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Exec Predicts IOC Ousters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO -- An IOC investigation into the scandal surrounding  
the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City could mean the forced 
resignations of up to a dozen IOC members, according to an IOC 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Anita DeFrantz, an IOC vice president from the United States,  
said Monday the probe is almost complete. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can assure you that the IOC will itself take action,'' she  
said. ``We know that we're asking the athletes to compete with 
integrity. We as IOC members must act with integrity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The International Olympic Committee later this month may remove  
committee members accused of accepting bribes from boosters trying 
to land the 2002 Games for Salt Lake City, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That investigation has pretty much concluded to the extent  
that letters have been sent to the members who apparently have 
abused their privilege,'' DeFrantz said. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspected IOC members have 10 days to respond to the  
accusations before a report is completed and a news conference is 
held Jan. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	``By that point, we believe that we will have folks who need to  
resign clearly identified and, I hope, resignations in hand,'' she 
said. ``So I expect there are going to be fewer members of the 
IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how many committee members will be forced out, she said:  
``I believe it will be less than a dozen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake Organizing Committee has been under fire since  
revelations of apparent bribery involving the 2002 Games surfaced 
two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Four investigations, including one by the Justice Department,  
have begun into allegations that some IOC members accepted lavish 
gifts and money -- more than $70,000 in one instance -- from Salt 
Lake boosters trying to win the games for their city. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz, an Olympic bronze medalist in 1976 in rowing, gave the  
keynote address Monday at the NCAA Convention. She and five other 
former college athletes were honored Sunday night as recipients of 
the NCAA Silver Anniversary Award. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz said that before the Salt Lake City scandal, she had  
not witnessed any wrongdoing by IOC members in connection with the 
2002 Games, or she would have disclosed it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, I did not see other people doing wrong,'' she  
said. ``It's something that's not easy to detect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although there have been reports of bribery involving past  
Olympics, DeFrantz said there must be proof before action can be 
taken. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, there have been rumors, but without facts you can't say,  
`Excuse me, you've abused your privilege. You have to be removed 
from the IOC,''' DeFrantz said. 
</P>
<P>
	For several reasons, she said, she does not believe the scandal  
will cause Salt Lake to lose the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake City was chosen because it was the best place to hold  
the competition, she said. She added that there is not enough time 
to make a change and the city would have won even without the 
``apparently compromised votes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz called the Salt Lake City scandal a ``sad moment'' in  
Olympic history. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tremendously sad for me, but I take solace in the fact  
that I know we can get through this,'' she said.

	Key events in Paula Jones' sexual harassment case against  
President Clinton: 
</P>
<P>
	1994:   	
</P>
<P>
	May 6: Mrs. Jones files a civil lawsuit against Clinton in U.S.  
District Court in Little Rock, Ark. She seeks $700,000 in damages 
for ``willful, outrageous and malicious conduct'' at the Excelsior 
Hotel in Little Rock on May 8, 1991. Her court papers accuse 
Clinton of ``sexually harassing and assaulting'' her, then defaming 
her with denials. 
</P>
<P>
	Aug. 10: Clinton files a motion to dismiss Mrs. Jones' lawsuit  
on grounds of presidential immunity. 
</P>
<P>
	Dec. 28: U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright rules that a  
trial cannot take place until Clinton leaves office. But she also 
rules that fact-finding procedures such as taking sworn statements 
can proceed. 
</P>
<P>
	1995:   	
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 17: Mrs. Jones asks the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  
in St. Louis to reverse the decision postponing a trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Sept. 14: A three-judge appeals court panel hears Clinton's

<HEADLINE> Caterpillar Sets Feb. 1 CEO Date </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- Glen Barton will take over as chairman and  
chief executive officer of Caterpillar Inc. Feb. 1, replacing the 
retiring Donald Fites. 
</P>
<P>
	Caterpillar announced last fall that Fites would retire soon  
after turning 65 on Jan. 20. Caterpillar has a mandatory retirement 
age of 65. 
</P>
<P>
	Fites, chairman and CEO since 1990, turned the money-losing  
Caterpillar into a profitable company and a model for flexibility 
and responsiveness to customer demand. He also became a bitter 
enemy of the United Auto Workers union after a contract dispute, 
lasting more than six years, in which he won some important 
concessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton, 59, started at Caterpillar 37 years ago as a civil  
engineer. He was group president of the company's construction and 
mining business when he was tapped in November to assume the job of 
vice chairman in preparation to take over the company.

<HEADLINE> Erickson Takes Over at Oregon State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORVALLIS, Ore. (AP) -- Dennis Erickson, fired two weeks ago by  
the Seattle Seahawks, became the coach at Oregon State on Tuesday, 
bringing championship credentials to a school haunted by 28 
straight losing seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to win football games,'' Erickson said during a news  
conference. ``We want to get to bowl games. We want to win the 
Pac-10. Let's don't settle with little things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Erickson, 51, takes over for Mike Riley, who last week was hired  
by the San Diego Chargers in something of a surprise move, 
considering Riley's teams went just 8-14 in two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Beavers' 5-6 record last season -- the school's first  
five-win campaign since 1971 -- and near victories against 
Washington, Cal and UCLA got Riley noticed. It also got Erickson's 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw what was happening here and I wanted to be a part of  
it,'' he said. ``That's why I'm here. I wanted to come in and 
continue the tradition that Mike Riley started.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hiring of Erickson, who was 31-33 in Seattle over four  
seasons after winning two national titles at Miami, came as a shock 
to many around the country. Oregon State hasn't had a winning 
season since 1970, when the Beavers won their last three games to 
finish 6-5. And the athletic program is deep in debt, with a budget 
deficit of more than $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Erickson, who signed a five-year contract worth $300,000 a year,  
said he wants to end his career at Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question about that,'' he said. ``I'm getting older  
by the minute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Erickson entered the packed news conference through a giant  
inflatable Beavers helmet to the sounds of a nine-piece band. As 
pom-pom-waving cheerleaders led the crowd in an Oregon State chant, 
the new coach said: ``I knew I missed something about college 
football, and that's it right there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Erickson met with about 75 players early Tuesday morning to tell  
them that they must raise their expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	``He expects us to win,'' center Aaron Koch said. ``With the  
confidence of knowing how far we've come, and how far we can go 
with coach Erickson, I know we're going to have a winning team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw their eyes today,'' Erickson said. ``I know they're  
excited about what's going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Erickson had a 113-40-1 record at Miami, Washington State,  
Wyoming and Idaho. His Miami teams were 63-9 from 1989 through 
1994, winning national championships in 1989 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	After his firing by the Seahawks, the Everett, Wash., native  
said it was important to stay in the Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get used to the rain, how can you live without it?''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Erickson will receive a base salary of $150,000, plus another  
$150,000 for from TV and radio. Riley's contract paid $135,000 a 
year, plus $50,000 for TV and radio, and a $330,000 housing 
allowance. Erickson will have no such allowance. 
</P>
<P>
	Erickson will, however, receive $1.15 million for the final year  
of his Seahawks contract. He was guaranteed $1.3 million, minus the 
$150,000 base salary from Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
	Erickson, who was fired Dec. 28, said he called Oregon State  
athletic director Mitch Barnhart about the job last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think when I called him, he thought I was calling about  
recommending somebody else,'' Erickson said. ``Obviously I 
wasn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Erickson said two of his Seahawks assistants, offensive line  
coach Gregg Smith and offensive quality control coach Eric Yarber, 
will follow him to Corvallis. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Oregon State athletic director Dee Andros, who wanted to  
hire Erickson in 1984 to replace Joe Avezzano but had his 
recommendation rejected, said that he's thought all along that 
Erickson was the right fit for the Beavers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always knew he was a great coach, and I've thought about it  
for 15 years,'' Andros, 75, said. ``I couldn't have thought of 
anybody I'd rather replace Mike with than Dennis. Erickson was a 
winner then, and he's going to be a winner now.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Punishes 3 Russia Institutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States imposed economic sanctions  
today against a Moscow university and two other Russian 
institutions, accusing them of leaking nuclear and missile 
technology to Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	National security adviser Sandy Berger announced the sanctions  
at a nonproliferation conference at which he also pledged an 
all-out effort to gain Senate ratification of the Comprehensive 
Test Ban Treaty. He said efforts would be redoubled to stop weapons 
expansion in North Korea, South Asia, the Mideast and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've made it very clear the administration has authority to  
act against entities that violate international nonproliferation 
standards and we will use that authority to protect our security,'' 
Berger said. Similar sanctions were imposed against seven other 
Russian institutions in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger gave no details of the sanctions, which are against  
Mendeleyev Chemical Technical University in Moscow, the Scientific 
Research and Design Institute of Power and Technology and the 
Moscow Aviation Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	``Weapons scientists and institutions face increased financial  
pressure to sell their wares to whomever is in the market, 
including rogue states,'' Berger said in a speech at the annual 
Carnegie International Non-proliferation Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger acknowledged that nonproliferation of Russian nuclear and  
missile technology would not be stopped by U.S. penalties but 
requires a tighter Russian export control system. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only Russia can police its own borders, factories and  
technology industry,'' Berger said. 
</P>
<P>
	The penalties in July barred U.S. dealings with seven Russian  
research and manufacturing enterprises for selling sensitive 
weapons technology to Iran, Libya and North Korea. The aim of such 
sanctions is to halt the proliferation of technology that could 
help those countries and others develop chemical, biological or 
nuclear weapons or the means of delivering them. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton in July signed an executive order that allows  
him to impose penalties when there has been an attempt to transfer 
technology as well as when transfers have actually occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing the campaign to gain Senate ratification of the  
test-ban treaty, Berger said it was critical to efforts to get 
India and Pakistan to back away from nuclear testing. The treaty, 
signed by 151 nations, would ban all nuclear test explosions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a terrible tragedy if the Senate failed to ratify  
the CTBT this year,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On North Korea, Berger said dealing with the world's ``most  
isolated, opaque nation'' requires a delicate balance of action and 
diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
	With Congress reluctant to continue paying for an anti-nuclear  
deal with North Korea, U.S. government and private analysts are 
examining alternatives for stopping an arms race on the Korean 
peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
	Some see signs that North Korea may be angling for a new deal as  
well -- one that would include an end to U.S. sanctions in exchange 
for a halt to missile tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pyongyang may be deliberately alarming us by manipulating what  
the intelligence community is seeing and hearing in order to get us 
to negotiate in earnest,'' said Lee Sigal, analyst with the Social 
Sciences Research Council. 
</P>
<P>
	Sigal, at a forum at the nonproliferation conference Monday,  
noted that North Korea has offered to negotiate an end to missile 
testing. He said the largely isolated communist nation wants 
political normalization with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	But recent missile tests, construction of a large underground  
facility and other developments in North Korea have raised doubts 
about the agreement that provides North Korea with oil shipments 
from the United States and, by about 2003, two internationally 
funded nuclear power reactors in exchange for abandonment of any 
nuclear weapons program. 
</P>
<P>
	Sigal joined National Security Council official Gary Samore and  
Michael R. Reiss of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development 
Organization on a panel at the annual conference, which ends today. 
</P>
<P>
	Samore, NSC senior director for nonproliferation and export  
control, said U.S. officials have been discussing several 
strategies that might eventually lead to a lifting of all or part 
of the U.S. sanctions against North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said concerns over the activities at a large underground  
facility in North Korea as well as the testing of missiles that 
could threaten U.S. forces in South Korea must be addressed first. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have made it clear to the North that if it made progress,  
that will result in progress overall in U.S.-North Korean 
relations,'' Samore said. He noted that U.S. strategy on the Korean 
peninsula is being reviewed under the direction of former Defense 
Secretary William Perry.

<HEADLINE> China Tries To Cut Steel Supplies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- China has imposed a two-year ban on new  
steel mills in an attempt to boost prices by cutting supply, a 
government official said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Metallurgical Industry Bureau also will close  
inefficient or low-quality producers, the official of the bureau 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban coincides with plans outlined by Premier Zhu Rongji to  
reform all state industries by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	China produces some 100 million tons of steel a year, but must  
import 3 million tons of high-quality steel, according to the 
government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``The steel industry has grown very fast over the past 20 years,  
but there are numerous small factories making poor-quality 
products,'' the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bureau says oversupply and poor quality have forced down  
Chinese steel prices, making it hard for producers, most of them 
state-owned, to recover costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese producers face stiff competition from cheap imported  
steel, whose price has dropped because of declining Asian 
currencies.

<HEADLINE> China Warns U.S. About Missiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A top Chinese diplomat warned the Clinton  
administration Tuesday against working with Japan or Taiwan on 
anti-missile defense systems, suggesting that Beijing might build 
more powerful missiles in response. 
</P>
<P>
	``This would have a negative impact on regional and global  
stability,'' said Sha Zukang, director general of the Chinese 
Foreign Ministry's arms control and disarmament division. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen is in Japan this week to discuss  
U.S.-Japanese cooperation on research for a theater missile defense 
system, a move the countries agreed to late last year following 
repeated North Korean testing of medium-range missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Clinton administration sells conventional arms to  
Taiwan, which China considers a renegade province, the United 
States is not helping the island develop a missile defense system. 
Some members of Congress have long favored the idea, however. 
</P>
<P>
	Sha, speaking to a nonproliferation conference sponsored by the  
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, reiterated China's 
opposition to U.S.-Japanese cooperation on any missile defense 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	``Other countries will be forced to develop more advanced  
missiles,'' Sha said. ``This will be in nobody's interests. ... We 
wish the United States was taking a more cautious and responsible 
attitude.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sha warned that if Taiwan develops the ability to shoot incoming  
missiles in the future, it could lead to fresh trouble in the 
Taiwan Straits. China's threatening of missile launches near Taiwan 
in 1995 and 1996 prompted the U.S. military to send two carriers to 
the region to show it was ready to defend Taipei. 
</P>
<P>
	China is among the few countries that have intercontinental  
ballistic missiles capable of reaching U.S. shores, including some 
with nuclear warheads. Last year, President Clinton and Chinese 
President Jiang Zemin agreed not to target one another's cities 
with ICBMs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Berger, the president's national security adviser, said in  
a separate speech at the conference that the United States wants to 
work with China and other Asian nations to dissuade North Korea 
from conducting more missile tests and exporting weapons to other 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger also said China should join the Missile Technology  
Control Regime, which prohibits export of missile parts. 
</P>
<P>
	Sha agreed missile development must be halted worldwide to  
reduce the risk that nuclear, biological and chemical weapons will 
be lauched. But he said that would be better accomplished not by 
controlling exports, but by expanding existing arms control 
treaties.

<HEADLINE> Property-Casualty Claims Total $10B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Property and casualty insurance claims totaled  
$10.07 billion in 1998 -- the third-highest amount in the past 
decade -- according to a study by the Insurance Services Office Inc. 
released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Georges was the single most catastrophic event for  
insurers last year, resulting in about $2.9 billion in claims -- by 
itself more expensive than 1997's total claims of $2.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York-based ISO Property Claims Services unit defines a  
catastrophe as an event that causes $25 million or more in insured 
property losses. Overall, there were 37 catastrophic events in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past 10 years, only two were worse than 1998.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, Hurricane Andrew helped cause an inflation-adjusted  
$26.7 billion worth of insurance claims, while 1994 saw $18.6 
billion worth of claims, in part because of the Northridge 
earthquake that hit California.

<HEADLINE> Gramm Focuses on Bank Overhaul Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Last October Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas,  
displayed a lone senator's power by blocking legislation to tear 
down Depression-era barriers between financial industries. Now that 
he's the new chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, he's making 
such a bill his highest priority. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm's shift, however, comes with a condition. He insisted  
Tuesday that something must be done about banks being forced to 
make ``kickbacks and bribes'' to activist groups, a practice he 
says is the result of community lending laws. 
</P>
<P>
	With the defeat in November of Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., the  
banking panel's former chairman, proponents of the sweeping 
legislation had feared Gramm's takeover could bring its demise. The 
legislation, which D'Amato had strongly pushed, would remove 
regulatory walls between the banking, securities and insurance 
industries and let them get more deeply into each other's 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm's opposition to the 1977 community lending laws led him to  
block the financial overhaul legislation in the Senate's waning 
days last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first public statements on banking issues since becoming  
chairman, Gramm appeared to soften his earlier insistence on a 
repeal of the lending laws, which require financial institutions to 
lend to the poor and minorities in their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, though, Gramm said lawmakers need to come up  
with a ``temporary solution'' to what he sees as a menacing 
problem: banks forced to make payments to community activists in 
return for the activists dropping their opposition to the banks' 
proposed mergers with other financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	The practice ``is little more than extortion,'' Gramm said at a  
news conference. The best short-term solution, he suggested, would 
be to bar banks from making cash payments to low-income groups. 
</P>
<P>
	But John Taylor, president and chief executive officer of the  
National Community Reinvestment Coalition, said such improper 
payments to activist groups are rare. 
</P>
<P>
	Laying out his legislative priorities, Gramm said he was  
determined to act swiftly on the financial overhaul bill, aiming 
for its approval by the Banking Committee by the end of February. 
That would be an extremely accelerated timetable for the Senate -- 
even if it weren't tied up by the impeachment trial of President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think (Gramm) set a very bold and ambitious timetable,''  
said Paul Schosberg, president of America's Community Bankers. ``On 
the other hand, why not? ... He's a very smart guy who knows how 
political processes work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm said the overhaul legislation was needed to keep pace with  
a rapidly changing marketplace and to make financial services more 
widely available ``and cheaper than they've ever been.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American consumers spend an estimated $300 billion a year on  
financial services. Backers of the overhaul legislation -- including 
the deep-pocketed securities and insurance industries, which have 
been pushing it for 20 years -- say it is needed to keep the U.S. 
financial industry competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation squeaked through the House last May by a 214-213  
vote but got mired in the Senate in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the banking industry opposed the legislation until last  
fall, when associations representing banks and independent 
insurance agents agreed to suggested changes regulating the sale of 
insurance by banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration generally supports overhauling the  
financial services laws but threatened a presidential veto if the 
bill retained the form passed by the House.

<HEADLINE> Stage Set for Impeachment Drama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The impeachment case against President Clinton  
will be prosecuted like a conspiracy, alleging that the president 
schemed to keep Monica Lewinsky from revealing their extramarital 
affair and ultimately plotted to ruin her reputation, according to 
legal papers and House officials. 
</P>
<P>
	While the House prosecutors placed final touches on their case,  
the White House prepared a trial brief that will suggest the House 
drew conclusions that ranged far beyond Independent Counsel Kenneth 
Starr's analysis, according to an outside adviser to Clinton who is 
familiar with the brief. 
</P>
<P>
	After the White House files its brief today, the strategies will  
move from written pages to the Senate chamber Thursday when the 
House opens its presentation. There, television cameras will show 
Americans their first live presidential impeachment trial and 
record the proceedings for history. 
</P>

	The House ``managers'' will try to connect a series of actions  
like prosecutors do in a mail fraud conspiracy, a House source 
said, speaking only on condition of anonymity. An overall scheme is 
alleged, and then overt acts are presented as evidence to 
demonstrate an attempt to carry it out. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House brief ``will argue Clinton admitted to an  
intimate relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and that in any 
relationship there is room for differing recollections,'' the 
outside adviser said, refusing to be quoted by name. 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to show a scheme to conceal the relationship and  
eventually destroy Ms. Lewinsky's reputation and credibility, the 
prosecutors plan to weave together conduct including: a job search 
for Ms. Lewinsky; hiding gifts she exchanged with Clinton; having 
her sign a false affidavit in the Paula Jones sexual harassment 
case against the president; possible coaching of presidential 
secretary Betty Currie; and Clinton's comments to aides that 
portrayed Ms. Lewinsky as the aggressor. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance on Dec. 5, 1997, lawyers representing Mrs. Jones  
placed Ms. Lewinsky on a potential witness list at a time her 
five-month job search had gone nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
	On Dec. 11 presidential friend Vernon Jordan, who had met with  
Ms. Lewinsky the previous month but produced no job contacts, 
suddenly began calling corporate executives and obtained 
interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors also planned to link the stepped-up search to a Dec.  
11 order from the Jones trial judge, who ruled Mrs. Jones was 
entitled to information on any state or federal employee who had 
had sexual relations with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president knew that it would be politically and legally  
expedient to maintain an amicable relationship with Monica 
Lewinsky,'' the brief said. A House source added the order was 
crucial because ``now she's not only on the witness list, but you 
can depose her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gifts, sought by the Jones subpoena, came into play on Dec.  
28, 1997, the House brief said. According to Ms. Lewinsky's grand 
jury testimony, Clinton asked her to ``let him think about'' what 
she should do with the items. Later that day, Ms. Lewinsky recalls 
Mrs. Currie calling to ask whether Ms. Lewinsky had ``something to 
give me.'' The secretary later arrived at Ms. Lewinsky's apartment 
to pick up the items. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ms. Currie's cell phone record corroborates Ms. Lewinsky,''  
the House brief said, and, ``The facts prove that the president 
directed Ms. Currie to pick up the gifts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But White House lawyers will argue that Mrs. Currie testified  
Clinton never asked her to pick up the gifts. And they'll note that 
Ms. Lewinsky testified Clinton never told her directly he was 
retrieving the gifts, the Clinton adviser said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 7, 1998, Ms. Lewinsky signed a false affidavit in the  
Jones case denying a sexual relationship, the House said. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, Ms. Lewinsky had a Jordan-arranged interview and  
told the president's friend it went poorly. Jordan called the 
company's CEO, Ronald Perelman. More interviews were held and Ms. 
Lewinsky was offered a job. 
</P>
<P>
	Perelman testified that Jordan ``had never called him before  
about a job recommendation.'' Jordan contended he had done so, to 
recommend hiring a former mayor of New York, a ``very talented'' 
attorney, a Harvard business school graduate and Ms. Lewinsky. Her 
``qualifications do not compare'' to the three others, the House 
brief said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton adviser said the White House was expected to  
highlight contradictory testimony and try to make a strong case 
that Ms. Lewinsky, Mrs. Currie and Jordan all made statements that 
support Clinton's denials of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors will focus on the president's oft-reported  
conversation with Mrs. Currie after his deposition in the Jones 
case, trying to show that Clinton was trying to coach a prospective 
witness. 
</P>
<P>
	``You were always there when Monica was there, right?'' Mrs.  
Currie recalled Clinton asking. 
</P>
<P>
	After the story of Ms. Lewinsky broke in the news media a year  
ago, ``the power and prestige of the Office of President was 
marshaled to destroy the character and reputation of Monica 
Lewinsky,'' the House brief said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton first simply denied the story to his aides. Then, the  
brief said, he ``added three new angles,'' portraying Ms. Lewinsky 
``as the aggressor''; portraying her ``as a stalker''; and 
presenting himself ``as the innocent victim being attacked by the 
forces of evil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president ``intended his aides to relate that false story to  
investigators and grand jurors alike,'' the House brief said.

<HEADLINE> Kaczynski's Reward To Go to Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The brother of Unabomber Ted Kaczynski said  
Tuesday he'll help out people hurt by paranoid schizophrenics by 
establishing a fund with the federal reward he got for turning in 
his brother. 
</P>
<P>
	David Kaczynski said he would have preferred the $1 million  
reward go entirely to victims of the bomb attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	But since taxes would have eaten up about three-quarters of the  
reward, David Kaczynski is doing what he figures is the next best 
thing. He and his wife, Linda Patrik, said they're giving about 
$500,000 to the Albany branch of The Community Foundation, a 
charity. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization will distribute the cash to people who were  
victims of crimes committed by paranoid schizophrenics. Ted 
Kaczynski, a former Berkeley mathematics professor turned backwoods 
hermit, was diagnosed by a prison psychiatrist as a paranoid 
schizophrenic. 
</P>
<P>
	Ted Kaczynski was convicted last year and is serving a life  
prison sentence for 16 attacks that killed three and injured 29 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	For legal reasons, the Kaczynskis can't earmark the money  
specifically for the victims or survivors and still get the tax 
exemption. But they have put some restrictions on where the money 
can go, and say they hope that the Unabomber's victims will apply 
for and get the funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Only people victimized between 1978 and 1995 in Connecticut,  
California, Utah, Illinois, Tennessee, Michigan and New Jersey are 
eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	Some $215,000 is expected to cover taxes the Kaczynskis will  
still have to pay and another $250,000 is going to pay the lawyer 
that worked with the family and federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels like a considerable relief,'' David Kaczynski said.  
``It feels like we've done what we can and it feels like we're one 
step closer to closure.''

<HEADLINE> Death Penalty Teach-In Goes Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Some teachers plan to go ahead Thursday  
with a controversial death penalty teach-in focusing on a man 
convicted of killing a policeman on the same day as a funeral for a 
slain Oakland officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The school board president, superintendent and teachers union  
president agree the event is insensitive. 
</P>
<P>
	But some teachers say the want to hold the teach-in, at least in  
modified form, arguing they are obliged to defend academic freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	Superintendent Carole Quan said Monday night she was canceling  
the event, despite an earlier vote by teachers to hold it. 
</P>
<P>
	That ruled out holding assemblies or inviting guest speakers.  
</P>
<P>
	But teachers and district officials said neither Ms. Quan nor  
the school board to whom she reports can interfere with what goes 
on in the classroom provided it falls within district guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	``The teach-in will go on,'' Sheila Quintana, president of the  
Oakland Education Association said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Quintana had recommended that her fellow union members  
postpone the event until Feb. 1 to give organizers time to come up 
with a more balanced lesson plan and avoid any suggestion of 
insensitivity to the death of Officer James Williams. The officer 
was killed by a sniper's bullet Saturday night and was to be buried 
on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the union's representative council voted 48-42 Monday night  
against delay, which has prompted sharp criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	School Board President Noel Gallo said the vote ``clearly will  
demonstrate to our parents that within our teaching profession 
there are those who put their political agendas ahead of basic 
education for our children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The teach-in, planned since October and initially sanctioned by  
Superintendent Carole Quan, was to focus on the case of Abu-Jamal, 
a black activist and radio journalist on death row for killing a 
Philadelphia policeman in 1981.

<HEADLINE> Will Smith Wins Three Music Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- He was a music star who became a TV star who  
became a movie star. Now he's a music star again. 
</P>
<P>
	Will Smith's return to hip hop, ``Big Willie Style,'' earned him  
three American Music Award trophies Monday night, to go along with 
his two 1998 MTV awards and a Grammy nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just glad people are accepting me again making the  
music,'' said Smith, who won favorite pop/rock album as well as 
favorite male artist and best album in the soul/rhythm and blues 
category. 
</P>
<P>
	The former star of TV's ``Fresh Prince of Bel-Air'' has a  
soaring film career as well. He recently finished shooting the 
big-screen version of ``The Wild Wild West,'' this summer's Fourth 
of July release, and currently appears in the hit ``Enemy of the 
State.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The movie business made its presence clear with two other  
winners at the 26th American Music Awards, selected by a national 
sample of about 20,000 music listeners. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian chanteuse Celine Dion, who sang the ubiquitous love  
ballad from ``Titanic,'' won awards for favorite adult contemporary 
artist and for female pop/rock artist, and composer James Horner 
won for the ``Titanic'' soundtrack. 
</P>
<P>
	Both suggested they were becoming weary of the ``Titanic'' hype.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's flattering, but I'm ready to move on,'' Horner said  
backstage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I need a break now,'' said Dion, who plans to perform through  
the end of the year, then take a rest. Asked backstage what she'll 
do away from music, she patted her stomach and said: ``Maybe work 
on a little baby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Showing the American Music Awards' tendency to favor  
tried-and-true performers, country singer Garth Brooks won three to 
bring his lifetime total to 13; Janet Jackson won the ninth of her 
career; Aerosmith won its fifth; and Pearl Jam also got its fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	But nothing could top the country group Alabama, which won a  
record 21st award. ``This never gets old,'' drummer Mark Herndon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Clapton, Lauryn Hill, Aerosmith, 'N Sync, Master P, K-Ci &AMP;  
JoJo, Enrique Iglesias and the Dixie Chicks rounded out the list of 
winners. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just like they say in country music, yee-haw!'' said Dixie  
Chick Natalie Maines in accepting the award. Asked backstage what 
the three-member group planned to do with the trophy, she said, 
``Fight over it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks was country's favorite male artist and his ``Sevens'' won  
the country album category. ``When they give it to the old, square 
guy, it's cool,'' Brooks said backstage. 
</P>
<P>
	Iglesias followed his father, Julio Iglesias, who last year was  
recipient of the American Music Awards' first favorite Latin music 
artist trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought I'd win an American music award for singing  
Spanish,'' the younger Iglesias said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill, who last week received a leading 10 nominations for the  
Feb. 24 Grammys, was named favorite new soul/R&AMP;B artist, her only 
AMA bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-hour show broadcast live from the Shrine Auditorium by  
ABC-TV was given a youthful face, with hosting duties shared by 
singer-actress Brandy and actress Melissa Joan Hart. 
</P>
<P>
	The show also included the presentation of an annual Award of  
Merit to Billy Joel and a reunion performance of Blondie, the 1970s 
New Wave band that broke up 16 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little surreal, but it's pretty good,'' said Blondie  
member Jimmy Destri. ``We just want to be back on stage. That's the 
thing.''

<HEADLINE> Baby Gets Bio-Engineered Skin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Eight-week-old Tori Cameron was born with a rare  
and deadly skin disease that causes severe blistering with the 
slightest touch. Patch by patch, she is receiving a new set of 
``skin'' that doctors hope will prolong her life. 
</P>
<P>
	``She won't be cured,'' her mother, Lorraine Cameron, said  
Monday. ``But she could get better. It won't be an ongoing process 
where she will die from it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tori is believed to be the first newborn diagnosed with  
epidermolysis bullosa to be given bio-engineered skin called 
Apligraf. So far, her tiny body is 40 percent covered with 
Apligraf, and it has blended so well doctors say they can't tell 
the new skin from Tori's baby skin. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope this skin will take over and teach the baby's skin  
cells to behave normally,'' said Dr. William Eaglstein, chairman of 
dermatology for the University of Miami School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Tori is the first to be given the elastic material for something  
other than healing wounds or for venous leg ulcers, said Dr. 
Lawrence Schachner, professor of pediatrics and dermatology at the 
university. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors demonstrated the procedure Monday by applying a  
7-centimeter patch of Apligraf to the blistered right calf of Tori, 
who is hospitalized at Jackson Children's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Apligraf, developed by Massachusetts-based Organogenesis, was  
approved by the Food and Drug Administration in May. 
</P>
<P>
	The skin is made from a baby's foreskin, removed at  
circumcision, and with bovine collagen. Doctors can grow 200,000 
units of Apligraf from a stamp-size piece of foreskin. 
</P>
<P>
	``A single foreskin can give you football fields of skin,''  
Schachner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tori was born Nov. 12 with Dowling Meara disease, a particularly  
lethal form of epidermolysis bullosa which affects 100,000 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Babies afflicted with the disorder are born lacking the  
necessary cells to hold their skin together and keep out bacteria 
and infections. The slightest friction can create painful blisters 
and lead to scarring, infections and raw spots similar to 
second-degree burns. 
</P>
<P>
	Tori's entire body is wrapped with gauze to minimize blistering  
and her hands and feet are protected to keep her from hurting 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors have applied between 15 to 20 pieces of the  
laboratory-made skin to Tori by simply placing it on her body and 
holding it in place with Vaseline and gauze. Each segment comes 
from the same donor and costs $975 per patch. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the best chance for this baby,'' Eaglstein said.

<HEADLINE> Chris Ford To Be Clippers Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Former Boston Celtics and Milwaukee Bucks  
coach Chris Ford will be hired Wednesday as coach of the Los 
Angeles Clippers, the Associated Press learned. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clippers have been without a coach since Bill Fitch was  
fired last April 20, two days after the team completed a 17-65 
season that was third-worst in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Fitch coached the Clippers to a 99-229 record in four seasons.  
He has a career record of 944-1,106. 
</P>
<P>
	Clippers spokesperson Jill Wiggins refused comment except to say  
the team would hold a press conference Wednesday at 3 p.m. PST at 
the Los Angeles Convention Center to make what she called a major 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford, who turned 50 on Monday, coached the Celtics from 1990-95  
and the Bucks for the last two seasons. He was fired 4 1/2 months ago 
with one year remaining on his contract after the Bucks went 36-46 
and failed to make the playoffs for the second straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford played in the NBA for 10 seasons, six with the Detroit  
Pistons and four with the Celtics. He was an assistant with the 
Celtics for seven years before his five-year tenure as coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Fitch was Ford's coach in his final three years as a player in  
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clippers had announced that Ford, former Sacramento Kings  
coach Eddie Jordan and Jim Brewer were the three finalists for the 
job. Brewer was an assistant under Fitch for four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``You hear so many different rumors,'' Clippers swing man Eric  
Piatkowski said after the team worked out Tuesday at Veterans 
Memorial Park in suburban Carson. ``I think each player has his own 
preference. We'll just have to wait and see. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can't do a whole lot right now, anyway,'' Piatkowski  
said, referring to the fact that coaches can't attend team workouts 
until the start of training camp next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Pooh Richardson, who also attended the practice, said the sooner  
the Clippers have a coach, the better. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of young guys,'' Richardson said. ``I don't know  
coach Ford. I know he played in the league, he's a person who fell 
victim to injuries (on the Bucks). 
</P>
<P>
	``They're all capable coaches, they all have positive strong  
points.''

<HEADLINE> Churches Take 'Baptist' From Name </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The Rev. Roddy Clyde discovered that he could add  
hundreds of parishioners to his church simply by subtracting the 
word ``Baptist'' from its name. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not ashamed to be a Baptist, but a brand name can be a  
hindrance,'' Clyde said Monday. ``Some people mistakenly associate 
the Baptist name with an angry, judgmental kind of 
fundamentalism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clyde's Trinity Baptist Church in Round Rock, Texas, became the  
Fellowship of Forest Creek in 1992. Around the country, many other 
churches are dropping ``Baptist'' from their names. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Point Community Church outside Columbia, S.C., dropped  
Southern Baptist from its name, and John Sharp, its 26-year-old 
pastor, prefers not to use the title of Reverend. 
</P>
<P>
	Although some ministers have been able to attract new members  
after the change, more conservative Southern Baptist pastors 
believe deleting the designation goes against Scripture. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most Southern Baptist churches have dropped the word  
`Southern' from their name -- we're no longer just in the South. But 
dropping the word `Baptist,' I don't think there's anything to gain 
from doing it,'' said Harvey Tingle, pastor at the Hampton Place 
Baptist Church in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Tingle said he supports anything that will help Baptists reach  
more people, but ``dropping the word from church names is a change 
from traditional values.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tradition is revered at the Southern Baptist Convention, which  
has 15.6 million members and is dominated by theological 
conservatives. In 1997, the church called for a boycott of the Walt 
Disney Co. over what it called gay-friendly policies. Last June, 
the convention said women should ``submit graciously'' to their 
husbands. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Hemphill, president of the Southwestern Theological Seminary  
in Fort Worth, said he doesn't think removing the denomination from 
a church's name can bring in more members. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of the fastest growing churches in the country still have  
`Baptist' in the label,'' he said. ``The key issue is not 
necessarily the name, but changes in the content of what happens in 
the church.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the churches that drop their Baptist label are otherwise  
adhering to Southern Baptist doctrine in many respects. 
</P>
<P>
	In Grapevine, just outside Dallas, senior pastor Ed Young wanted  
to draw a new crowd -- younger people, even Jews -- to his 
6,000-member church. And so, the Las Colinas Baptist Church became 
the Fellowship Church. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, we changed the name for one reason -- to reach as  
many people as possible,'' Young said. ``People now don't have the 
product loyalty, or the denomination loyalty, they once had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young has also tried passing out neon yellow sunglasses  
promoting a lecture series and T-shirts pushing Saturday services 
to get what he calls ``unchurched'' people to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the number of members increased dramatically when the  
name changed, but he admitted some conservative members left 
because of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tell people my church is not for everyone,'' Young said.  
``Each church is autonomous and has a different style for different 
styles of people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Lake Hills Church in Austin, pastor Mack Richard took  
``Baptist'' out of the title to remove what he regarded as a 
barrier to people of other denominations. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn Stanford, a 28-year-old real estate agent who attends  
Lake Hills, said he grew up in a Southern Baptist home and 
understands that the word is associated with ``the old way, the 
hard way of doing things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``To some degree, leaving it out of a name does matter, but I  
have enough knowledge about Baptists to know that it doesn't matter 
to me,'' Stanford said.

<HEADLINE> Expos Pres. Agrees to $9.9M Buyout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- Montreal Expos president Claude Brochu agreed  
Tuesday to sell his shares of the baseball team for $9.9 million, 
helping to clear the way to refinance the club and build a new 
downtown stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Brochu has reportedly insisted on staying on as  
president, a demand that is expected to meet resistance when the 
ownership group meets on Wednesday to review its plan to save the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Some potential investors may refuse to buy into the team if  
Brochu stays on. Brochu, who left Monday for an owners meeting in 
California, will not attend the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Expos owners announced in October that they would seek new  
investors to buy into the team and help finance a new stadium. 
Brochu agreed to sell his share of the club at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Under an agreement with major league baseball, the owners had  
150 days to find new investors and announce whether they would 
build a new stadium or sell the team to a buyer in another city. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale price for Brochu's 7.6 percent share of the Expos sets  
the value of the team at $130 million. The club was bought from 
Charles Bronfman in 1991 for about $66 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, the Globe and Mail reported that the Expos have  
signed a lease with the Olympic Installations Board that would see 
the team play the 2000 season at Olympic Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The team had until Dec. 31 to decide if it would renew the  
lease. The deal was formally completed last week, said limited 
partner Mark Routtenberg.

<HEADLINE> State of the Union Will Go On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- On one level, the state of the union is a  
breeze. ``In a sentence, here's how I assess our present condition: 
America is working again,'' President Clinton says. Capitalize the 
letters -- as in, State of the Union -- and things get complicated. 
</P>
<P>
	With official Washington tied up in knots over Clinton's  
impeachment trial, some in Congress have called for a postponement 
of his annual prime-time speech to a joint session of the House and 
Senate. But the congressional leadership has not officially asked 
Clinton to put it off. 
</P>
<P>
	White House aides are emphatic that the show will go on Jan. 19  
even though that is the day Clinton's lawyers are scheduled to open 
his defense in the Senate trial on charges stemming from the Monica 
Lewinsky affair. Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said 
Sunday that Clinton should give the address, even though it may be 
``uncomfortable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the president's political advisers view the speech as an  
immensely important opportunity to convince Americans that he can 
still lead. A high job approval rating is his best defense against 
a Senate conviction, they say, and Clinton's poll ratings generally 
improve after State of the Union addresses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our objective is to show continued vitality and energy,'' said  
White House deputy chief of staff Maria Echaveste. ``We have a lot 
of work to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton scribbled his way through a 20-to-30-page, double-spaced  
second draft of the speech over the weekend and was working with 
speechwriters again today. Another revised draft or two, and he 
will begin rehearsing in the White House family theater. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether Clinton directly addresses the Lewinsky matter when he  
faces lawmakers and TV cameras in the House chamber is largely a 
personal decision and ``one that most likely will be put off until 
the end,'' press secretary Joe Lockhart said. The president didn't 
mention the scandal last year, days after it surfaced, and his poll 
numbers jumped. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on hold for now is how specific Clinton will get on Social  
Security reform. One top adviser, speaking on condition of 
anonymity, said the White House is struggling with how to progress 
beyond last year's clarion call to ``Save Social Security first,'' 
without boxing Clinton in on details not yet weighed by 
congressional Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to move the ball forward a little without making  
anyone feel they've been left behind,'' this adviser said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president has been very publicly working out the rhetoric  
and policy of the speech. 
</P>
<P>
	To the Democratic Leadership Council, he spoke of a ``Third  
Way'' alternative to the old, ideological lines of conservatives 
and liberals. 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing the Detroit Economic Club last Friday, he tested the  
catch phrase ``American economic renaissance,'' which echoed of the 
``New Covenant'' from his 1995 State of the Union address. 
</P>
<P>
	The sound bite from Clinton's Jan. 6 celebration of a $76  
billion surplus -- ``We can say the era of big deficits is over!'' -- 
rang like the headlines from his 1996 State of the Union when he 
proclaimed, ``The era of big government is over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The substance similarly takes shape by connecting the dots  
between Clinton's recent public remarks: 
</P>
<P>
	--Jan. 2. In his weekly radio broadcast, Clinton countered  
critics of his defense policy by asking for $100 billion over six 
years to beef up military readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	--Jan. 4. In his first White House appearance this year, Clinton  
called for a $6.2 billion, five-year package of tax cuts and other 
help for families giving long-term care to the elderly and 
disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Previous State of the Union speeches have been about children  
and education,'' said White House communications director Ann 
Lewis. ``This year you'll see an attention to Social Security, 
long-term care and Medicare. As the president talks about what our 
future is, one thing is we're getting older.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Jan. 5. Clinton proposed $215 million in his next budget to  
test and treat inmates for drug use to keep them from returning to 
crime once freed. 
</P>
<P>
	--Jan. 6. Trumpeting the budget surplus, Clinton warned against  
resting on laurels or hastily squandering the pot on tax cuts. He 
spoke of ``investment needs'' in education, job training and health 
research. 
</P>
<P>
	--Jan. 7. Clinton called for tripling funds for after-school  
programs that keep kids motivated and occupied in the hours before 
their parents get home from work. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, White House events on the environment, health care  
and crime will round out the policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``This president's got an awful lot he wants to accomplish,''  
said White House communications strategist Paul Begala. ``He's 
going to challenge the country and the Congress to address'' those 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides acknowledged that much of this year's speech is likely to  
ring of the unfinished business from last year's address: national 
education standards and testing; child care; school construction; 
the anti-tobacco campaign against youth smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope the new Congress will take the lessons of the election  
to heart and try to get a lot more done than the last one,'' said 
domestic policy chief Bruce Reed. 
</P>
<P>
	Could there be any surprises in Clinton's speech? ``I don't want  
to scoop his news,'' Begala said.

<HEADLINE> Parini Wins FIS Snowboarding Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERCHTESGADEN, Germany (AP) -- Italy's Margerita Parini wiped  
away a disappointing Olympics Tuesday by winning the women's giant 
slalom title in the FIS Snowboarding World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Parini, the World Cup leader, roared down a hard fast course in  
2 minutes, 18.51 seconds to catch American Sondra Van Ert on the 
second run. 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow Italian Lidia Trettel finished second in 2:19.10 while  
Van Ert, the defending champion, faded to third at 2:19.24. 
</P>
<P>
	Parini said her first major title made up for Nagano, where the  
26-year-old broke into tears after a disastrous first run led to a 
13th-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
	``This medal is for me -- I've worked so hard,'' Parini said.  
</P>
<P>
	Van Ert was initially awarded second place, but International  
Ski Federation officials revised Trettel's time a half hour after 
the race after discovering a timing malfunction. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Ert, leader after the first heat, seemed to have the race  
won when she still led by almost a half-second midway through her 
second run. 
</P>
<P>
	But she slowed on the lower portion of the course to fall back  
to third. 
</P>
<P>
	``My coaches said I lost a second and a half there,'' Van Ert,  
34, of Ketchum, Idaho said. ``I have no idea why. Maybe I thought, 
`Hey, you've survived the toughest part of the course' and let 
down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both the Olympic gold medalist, France's Karine Ruby, and silver  
medalist Heidi Renoth of Germany took themselves out of contention 
with poor first runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruby, spinning out on her first run, finished 13th and Renoth  
43rd. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Ert, who once finished 11th in an World Cup Alpine downhill  
race before switching boards, now has two bronzes and a gold in the 
three snowboard world championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd rather have a gold today, but I'll take it -- that's  
something,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosie Fletcher of Girdwood, Alaska was third after the first  
run, but crashed near the finish line to finish 19th.

<HEADLINE> Dowhower To Run Eagles' Offense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Eagles hired Rod Dowhower  
as their offensive coordinator on Tuesday, a day after hiring Andy 
Reid as their new head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Dowhower, 55, was the New York Giants' quarterbacks coach under  
Jim Fassel the past two seasons. He is a seasoned veteran of the 
West Coast offense, learning it from Bill Walsh at Stanford in the 
late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	In a flurry of activity on his second day on the job, Reid also  
hired Wisconsin offensive coordinator Brad Childress to be his 
quarterbacks coach. The key hire was Dowhower, who coached under 
Walsh, played for Don Coryell and was teammates with Joe Gibbs in 
college. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is one of the fine offensive minds in the NFL,'' Reid said.  
``He's done it all, and he's very well respected throughout the 
league for his knowledge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reid, 40, became the second-youngest head coach in the NFL on  
Monday with a $5 million, five-year contract with the Eagles. 
Dowhower has been a head coach and coordinator in college and the 
NFL -- experience that should ease Reid's transition from 
quarterbacks coach in Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Childress, 42, has been offensive coordinator and quarterbacks  
coach at Wisconsin since 1992. He went to five bowl games with the 
Badgers, who won the Rose Bowl this year, and served on the same 
staff with Reid at Division I-AA Northern Arizona in the late 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Childress was Dowhower's quarterbacks coach with the Colts in  
1985. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brad is a very diverse coach,'' Reid said. ``In Brad, you're  
getting a guy who knows both the passing game and the running game 
thoroughly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles made no announcement regarding defensive coordinator.  
Reports in Milwaukee say that Emmitt Thomas, who held the job under 
Ray Rhodes, will follow his friend to the Packers. Rhodes, fired by 
the Eagles, was named head coach in Green Bay on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles also announced the signing of four players: kicker  
David Akers, receiver Kotto Cotton, punter Tony Martino and 
receiver Harvey Middleton.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals Hire Easler As Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mike Easler is replacing Dave Parker as hitting  
coach for the St. Louis Cardinals next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Easler managed the Nashua Pride of the Atlantic League last  
season. He previously was a hitting coach at Boston and Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mike possesses a strong combination of abilities that you look  
for in a hitting coach,'' manager Tony La Russa said Tuesday. 
``He's strong with both the mechanical and mental sides of 
hitting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a 14-year major league career, Easler hit .293 with 118  
home runs and 522 RBIs. He played for Boston, California, 
Pittsburgh, the New York Yankees and Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Parker left the Cardinals to return to business interests in  
Cincinnati.

<HEADLINE> Stuntman Killed on Norris' Set </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CEDAR HILL, Texas (AP) -- A veteran stuntman died Tuesday during  
the filming of a dangerous car chase for an episode of the 
television show ``Walker, Texas Ranger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Charles Skeen apparently suffered a fatal heart attack  
when the GMC Suburban in which he was riding made a rough landing 
after hurtling 140 feet through the air in a state park, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It flew through the air like an eagle and didn't do anything  
weird,'' said police Lt. Rick Sullivan. ``But that sucker hit and 
it hit hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The driver of the Suburban, which was specially rigged for  
safety, was taken to a hospital for evaluation of head and neck 
injuries, Sullivan said. The stuntman, 37, who asked that his name 
not be released, was in fair condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Skeen, 49, of Greenville, died ``of an apparent cardiac  
arrest,'' CBS said in a release. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are grief-stricken over our friend's sudden and tragic  
death,'' Walker star and executive producer Chuck Norris said in 
the statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident happened at about 10:20 a.m. as an episode was  
being filmed on a winding road in Cedar Hill State Park, located in 
rugged terrain about 15 miles southwest of Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	As three cameras recorded the stunt, the Suburban was launched  
from a specially-constructed ramp at 35 mph and slammed down in a 
grove of small hackberry and locust trees. 
</P>
<P>
	A review of the videotapes showed that the stunt appeared to  
have gone as planned, although the truck hit hard enough to break 
the front axles, Sullivan said.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Facing Endorsement Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The sponsors who have made Michael Jordan the  
highest-paid athlete endorser are hoping the Chicago Bulls star can 
keep working wonders for their products even after he quits playing 
in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	But experts say Jordan will have to show the same dexterity in  
business as he did in basketball if he is to defy the conventional 
wisdom that says athletes quickly lose their commercial appeal once 
they retire. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan is expected to announce his retirement today from the  
National Basketball Association, where he is viewed by many as the 
best to play the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``His advertisers will not be surprised by his decision but they  
will be disappointed that Michael hasn't chosen to extend his 
career another year or two,'' said Bob Williams, who heads Burns 
Sports, a Chicago firm that matches advertisers and athletes. 
``It's a definite blow to advertisers who have him under 
contract.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's endorsement durability survived a short-lived  
retirement from basketball a few years ago when he left to play 
baseball. The Bulls star, who makes an estimated $42 million to $47 
million a year from endorsements, currently has deals with about a 
dozen brands ranging from Gatorade sports drinks and Ball Park 
Franks to Hanes underwear, Rayovac batteries, a Bijan cologne and 
MCI WorldCom phone service. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired athletes who can remain commercial draws are rare --  
baseball's Joe Dimaggio was a popular pitchman for Mr. Coffee well 
after his playing days and Jim Palmer can still be seen inviting 
viewers to The Money Store. 
</P>
<P>
	But many other sports figures find advertisers quit calling once  
they are no longer hitting home runs, scoring touchdowns or 
slamming a basketball through the hoop regularly in a sports arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Some marketing experts and the companies with deals with Jordan  
say this time will be different, however. 
</P>
<P>
	They said Jordan raised the level of how involved an athlete  
could become with an endorser. He signed multi-year deals rather 
than one-shot commercial arrangements. And his popularity helped 
sponsors' business and image. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just as Michael broke the mold within the league, he can do it  
for the retired athlete as well,'' said Ryan Schinman, a marketing 
executive at Worldwide Entertainment &AMP; Sports, a New York agency 
that represents athletes and matches companies with sports figures. 
</P>
<P>
	He may be best-known for his association with Nike Inc., which  
signed Jordan shortly after he turned pro in 1984. The sneaker 
company named a line of shoes Air Jordan after him to call 
attention to his gravity-defying ability to leap to the basket and 
change the direction of his shot as he approached the hoop. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike declined comment pending a statement from Jordan on reports  
he would retire. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has been taking steps to prepare for Jordan's  
eventual retirement, creating a separate division last year for the 
Jordan brand of shoes and apparel and creating commercials that 
showed Jordan in a business suit calling the shots for the Jordan 
line. Nike has said Jordan would continue to play an important role 
in that business after he retires. 
</P>
<P>
	Quaker Oats Co.'s Gatorade sports drink division invited people  
to imagine what it would be to ``Be Like Mike'' in advertising as 
recently as last year. 
</P>
<P>
	His 10-year contract with Gatorade runs through 2001.  
</P>
<P>
	Sue Wellington, president of the Gatorade U.S. division, said  
Jordan will be featured in its ads this year no matter what he 
decides about playing basketball. ``It's not about what he is 
doing, but who he is,'' she said, saying his competitive spirit 
makes him an effective spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Two companies have been using Jordan in their ads without making  
any reference to his NBA career, and they expect he will remain 
valuable either as an active player or in retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Rayovac, the battery maker from Madison, Wis., signed Jordan  
after he ended his 18-month NBA retirement in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we first got involved with Jordan, we made a conscious  
effort to portray him as a person rather than a basketball 
player,'' said Rayovac spokesman John Daggett. ``His image has 
transcended the sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daggett said Jordan has helped Rayovac introduce what has become  
the leading rechargeable battery and built its share of the market 
for maximum alkaline batteries against bigger rivals Energizer and 
Duracell. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom has shown Jordan keeping in touch with his animated  
pals from his ``Space Jam'' movie of a few years ago in current ads 
for its Sunday calling rates. ``We will be happy with the 
arrangement even if he decides to retire,'' said MCI WorldCom 
spokeswoman Kelly Seachrist. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael Jordan is so well known and so successful that we  
think that puts him a cut above the other athletes,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Now Duval Is Setting the Standard  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	David Duval is used to this kind of reception.  
</P>
<P>
	The hundreds of people who had watched him stick an 8-iron  
within 6 feet at the sixth hole on the Kapalua Plantation course, 
the shot that sent him soaring to a smashing victory in the 
Mercedes Championship, suddenly turned away when Duval approached 
the green. 
</P>
<P>
	Why?  
</P>
<P>
	Tiger Woods, one group ahead of him, had just teed off.  
</P>
<P>
	``Heck, I'm a Tiger Woods fan,'' Duval said after his  
nine-stroke victory, the biggest on tour since Woods' 12-shot win 
at the 1997 Masters. ``I think he's great. If I was here to watch, 
I might watch him, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gallery still follows Woods in droves. But when it comes to  
the players, most of the attention now is centered on Duval. 
</P>
<P>
	``David right is our dominant guy,'' Fred Funk said.  
</P>
<P>
	Woods burst onto the tour in such a way that far surpasses  
anything Duval has done, if not because he won but how he won. He 
was largely responsible for the 40 percent increase in purses this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Above all, he was cited by several players as an inspiration to  
play better or get left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said that on more than one occasion,'' Duval said. ``I think  
people come along in every sport that makes all the other 
participants keep up or get blown away. I think that's what you're 
starting to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The question now is, from whom?  
</P>
<P>
	Is it Woods, who has won as many tour events as Brandel Chamblee  
over the past 18 months? Or is it Duval, whose eight victories in 
15 months is second only to Nick Price this decade as the hottest 
run on tour? 
</P>
<P>
	``Tiger upped the level,'' Tom Watson said. ``The tour benefited  
from a lot of things with the advent of Tiger Woods, but the 
biggest thing was that competition level became keener. But David 
stepped up. He's right there with Tiger. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, he has surpassed him.''  
</P>
<P>
	Duval will have none of that. A reluctant star behind those  
wraparound glasses, he steers clear of comparisons to Woods, or 
anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think of myself -- never have, probably never will -- as  
a superstar,'' Duval said. ``Everybody wants to compare me with 
Tiger, Mark O'Meara. I don't think in those terms. I know how to 
play this game, though. I'm good at it. Whether I'm the best or not 
is not a concern of mine. I just do my job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lately, he has been doing it better than anyone -- eight  
victories in his last 27 starts, whether that means shooting 64 on 
the final day (Houston), trying to protect a seven-shot lead in the 
final round (Tucson) or running away from a collection of 
tournament champions (Mercedes). 
</P>
<P>
	Is there anything about Duval's game that Woods does better?  
</P>
<P>
	His driving is the best package of length and accuracy. His iron  
play is solid. His chipping? Duval answered that with an 80-foot 
pitch with 30 feet of break that stopped rolling 2 feet from the 
hole. 
</P>
<P>
	And, as O'Meara said after Duval's seventh consecutive round in  
the 60s, ``You don't shoot those scores if you don't putt good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps Woods said it best: ``What you want to do out here is to  
prove you're better than any other player. David has been doing 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And that begs the question: If Woods was the inspiration for  
Duval and everyone else, is Duval now the standard against which 
players measure themselves? 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought about that,'' Duval said, so uncomfortable  
with the idea that he repeated his answer. ``I guess you could view 
it that way. But I don't think that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nor does Woods.  
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' Woods said. ``I'm pushing myself as hard as I can. The  
way he's going, that's great golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That used to be Woods. He won six times on tour in his first 21  
events as a pro, but only once in his last 29. Now, it is time for 
Woods to rise to Duval's level the way Duval rose to his. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know Tiger hasn't won the amount of tournaments that we all  
anticipated he will win,'' O'Meara said. ``But I think that's just 
a matter of time. He's 23, David is 27. Let's give Tiger three or 
four years and see what happens. He has those tools to do exactly 
what David is doing now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Funny, isn't it?  
</P>
<P>
	Only a year ago, it seemed as though the only player mentioned  
in the same breath with Woods was Jack Nicklaus and his 18 majors. 
Now, the anticipation is whether Woods can stack up to a player who 
has yet to win his first major.

<HEADLINE> USWeb founder leaves job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE -- A Silicon Valley executive who has propelled several  
high-tech companies to starry heights is quitting the business to 
pursue his own planetary passion: extraterrestrial beings. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a bigger picture out there than just tomorrow's stock  
price,'' said Joe Firmage on Monday. ``I've had explicit 
confirmation that the UFO phenomenon is in fact occurring, and I'd 
like to be a part of this fundamental revolution in our society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Firmage, 28, said he decided to quit being the chief strategist  
at the Internet consulting firm USWeb/CKS Corp. to save the company 
from ``public relations complications'' as he pursues his 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a big step for this Silicon Valley wonderboy, who began his  
high-tech life at 17 by founding Serius Corp. The company, selling 
object-based programming tools for personal computer developers, 
was acquired by Novell in 1993 for an estimated $24 million. 
Firmage was acquired as well, becoming Novell's vice president of 
strategic planning. 
</P>
<P>
	He left Novell and co-founded USWeb in 1995 with several other  
Novell executives. Last month the company merged with CKS Group 
Inc. to form a company with $260 million in annual revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've done a lot in my life,'' Firmage said. ``I have a lot to  
be thankful for and proud of. I also have shown that I'm rational 
and level headed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Firmage said his priorities shifted 15 months ago, after an  
encounter at his Los Gatos, Calif., home with a ``remarkable being, 
clothed in brilliant white light ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't call them aliens. I call them teachers,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Since that experience, Firmage has been investigating and  
publicizing what he says is the existence of UFO phenomena. So far, 
he says the pursuit -- which includes a book published on the 
Internet -- has cost him $3 million and quite possibly his 
reputation as a savvy high-tech businessman. 
</P>
<P>
	Last November, concerned that his beliefs could drag his company  
down, Firmage stepped down as CEO to be replaced by Robert Shaw, a 
51-year-old former Oracle Corp. executive. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday Firmage said he needed to break away from USWeb/CKS  
entirely, rather than potentially damage the company. 
</P>
<P>
	USWeb/CKS officials said they will miss Firmage and regretted  
the loss.

<HEADLINE> SLOC Picks Drug Testing Lab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Olympics officials selected an Indiana  
University clinic as the drug testing laboratory for the 2002 
Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug lab, accredited by the International Olympic Committee,  
was founded in 1983 and performed testing for the 1987 Pan-Am 
Games, the 1996 Paralympic Games and the 1998 Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The lab is under the direction of Larry Bowers, who was deputy  
director of drug testing for the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look forward to the collaborative effort with Dr. Bowers  
and Indiana University,'' said Dr. Charles Rich, the chief medical 
officer for the Salt Lake Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Rich headed an eight-member selection panel that selected the  
lab. The only other IOC-accredited lab in the United States is at 
UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Douglas E. Rollins was named SLOC's medical director for  
doping control in mid-November. Rollins, who is also the director 
of the Center for Human Toxicology at the University of Utah, will 
begin working on Jan. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Rollins will consult with Bowers during the development of the  
doping control program and laboratory in Salt Lake City. A program 
manager for doping control will be added sometime this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indiana lab tests about 18,000 samples per year and has  
helped develop drug testing programs for college athletics and the 
NFL.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Push Plan for Disabled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will ask for $2 billion over  
five years to help tens of thousands of disabled Americans return 
to work by making it easier for them to keep their health 
insurance, and providing tax credits and better rehabilitation 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement will cap years of effort by the disability  
community and members of Congress to encourage people with 
disabilities to go to work. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 1 barrier, advocates say, is the loss of the health  
coverage that is so important to people suffering from conditions 
that require extensive medical care. Often, people with 
disabilities find jobs that do not offer health insurance, and 
often their disabilities make it extraordinarily expensive to buy 
coverage on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was to announce the proposal Wednesday. It's the latest  
in a series of events previewing the budget he will submit to 
Congress next month, as he tries to focus attention on policy 
during his impeachment trial in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton plans to endorse legislation being introduced next week  
by Sens. James Jeffords, R-Vt., and Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., 
congressional sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The threat of losing federal health benefits is a powerful  
disincentive which prevents disabled people who want to work from 
entering the work force,'' Jeffords and Kennedy said in a statement 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The president will also offer tax credits to help disabled  
workers pay for transportation, equipment and other expenses and 
more money to develop new information and communications 
technologies to help people with disabilities function in the 
workplace. 
</P>
<P>
	And Clinton will back a plan that would let people with  
disabilities choose their rehabilitation center, creating 
competition for the first time for the organizations that train 
people to take jobs. Centers that successfully place people in jobs 
would get bonus payments, thus reaping some of the savings the 
government will realize from reduced disability payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the current system, less than one-half of 1 percent of the  
10 million Americans receiving disability benefits ever return to 
work, including people in the Social Security system for workers 
and the Supplemental Security Income program for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Their advocates argue that's because the system punishes them  
when they go to work -- forcing them to choose between health 
benefits and a job. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're taking the biggest programs, the most money we're  
spending and reorienting them in a way that promotes work,'' said 
Andrew Imparato of the National Council on Disability. 
</P>
<P>
	The health plan, at a $1.2 billion five-year cost, would  
encourage states to offer Medicaid to people who return to work, 
allowing them to buy into the program even if their incomes are too 
high under current limits. States could also let people buy into 
Medicaid even if their conditions have improved but they remain 
impaired and need health coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan would also allow people with disabilities to continue  
receiving Medicare benefits, which are not as generous as state 
benefits but would be available to people across the nation, 
regardless of a state's policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will endorse two other initiatives:  
</P>
<P>
	--A $750 million, five-year plan to give $1,000 tax credits to  
people with disabilities who go back to work. This would help 
defray the cost of transportation, technology and other expenses 
necessary to take a job. 
</P>
<P>
	--Doubling money spent on developing assisted technology to help  
people with disabilities function. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation being offered by Jeffords, chairman of the  
Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, and Kennedy, the 
panel's top Democrat, would also create a demonstration project to 
test the effect of phasing out benefits as people earn more. 
</P>
<P>
	Under current law, disability beneficiaries lose their entire  
grants if they earn more than $500 a month, prompting some to turn 
down raises or limit their hours.

<HEADLINE> Oregon State Abuzz Over Erickson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORVALLIS, Ore. (AP) -- A week ago, morale was low on the Oregon  
State campus -- and in the Dennis Erickson household. 
</P>
<P>
	Oregon State had just lost its promising football coach, Mike  
Riley, to the San Diego Chargers. And Erickson was still stung by 
his dismissal from the Seattle Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Erickson and long-suffering Beavers fans began what  
both hope will be a long, fruitful relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	Erickson, who won two national titles coaching the Miami  
Hurricanes, signed a five-year contract to coach the Beavers. 
Erickson's first priority will be trying to salvage the recruiting 
season. But goal number two is far more ambitious: putting together 
a winner at a school that hasn't finished above .500 since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw what was happening here and I wanted to be a part of  
it,'' Erickson said. ``That's why I'm here. I wanted to come in and 
continue the tradition that Mike Riley started.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Erickson is by far the most high-profile coach the Beavers have  
ever had, and the Oregon State athletic program, mired in an $8 
million budget deficit, should get a quick infusion of cash. School 
officials reported that about 500 people called Tuesday to order 
season tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The phone lines are ringing off the hook,'' said OSU athletic  
director Mitch Barnhart, who hired Erickson after a frenzied 
four-day search. ``People are genuinely excited about what he has 
brought to Oregon State.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Erickson, 51, takes over a program that was a surprise in the  
Pac-10 this season. The team posted its first five-victory season 
since 1971, and nearly beat Washington, Cal and UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just enjoyed how they played, and the enthusiasm, and how  
tough they played,'' Erickson said. ``They looked like they were 
having a heck of a lot of fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riley, who stood at the back of the crowded conference room,  
said the timing worked out perfectly for Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was some fortune as far as the timing was concerned,''  
Riley said. ``What a great thing for that to come together like it 
did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Erickson was fired by the Seahawks on Dec. 28 after going 31-33  
in four seasons. Mike Holmgren replaced him and signed a $4 million 
a year deal to be coach and general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think (Seahawks owner Paul Allen) opened the wallet when  
Mike Holmgren came there,'' Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Erickson will get a base salary of $150,000 a year, plus  
$150,000 annually for radio and TV. Erickson will receive $1.15 
million for the final year of his Seahawks contract. He was 
guaranteed $1.3 million, minus the $150,000 base salary from OSU. 
He said he wants to retire at Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question about that,'' he said. ``I'm getting older  
by the minute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Erickson entered the packed news conference through a giant  
inflatable Beavers helmet to the sounds of a nine-piece band. As 
pom-pom-waving cheerleaders led the crowd in an Oregon State chant, 
the new coach said: ``I knew I missed something about college 
football, and that's it right there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Erickson met with about 75 players early Tuesday morning to  
introduce himself and tell them that they must raise their 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	``He expects us to win,'' said center Aaron Koch. ``With the  
confidence of knowing how far we've come, and how far we can go 
with Coach Erickson, I know we're going to have a winning team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw their eyes today,'' Erickson said. ``I know they're  
excited about what's going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Erickson had a 113-40-1 record at Miami, Washington State,  
Wyoming and Idaho. His Miami teams went 63-9 from 1989 through 
1994. The Hurricanes won national championships in 1989 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The Everett, Wash., native said it was important for him and his  
wife, Marilyn, to stay in the Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get used to the rain, how can you live without it?''  
he said.

<HEADLINE> SBC Cuts Price for Internet Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- In an aggressive bid to dominate the market  
for Internet access, SBC Corp. will triple the availability of 
superfast hookups in California and cut the price from $89 to $39 a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC, the parent corporation of Pacific Bell, hopes the low price  
and greater availability will help the company expand ADSL service 
to 10 million business and home customers in seven states, 
including California, by the end of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	For $49 a month, the ADSL package will include an Internet  
access package. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is will unleash the power of the Internet for the  
masses,'' said David Gallemore, SBC's executive vice president for 
strategic marketing, on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Asymmetrical Digital Subscriber Line service, which has the  
potential to provide lightening-quick connections over existing 
phone lines, is one of several rival technologies that help 
computer users make the most of the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	As it is, information flowing over conventional phone lines  
tends to get bottlenecked just outside homes or businesses, slowing 
the data down and making a chore out of downloading large data, 
music or video files. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC's main rivals include cable TV companies that hope to  
persuade customers to use special modems and get their information 
through coaxial cable lines, avoiding the phone companies 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, even customers willing to pay more for ADSL hookups  
have had to wait in line for installation. SBC is investing $100 
million to remove that barrier as well. Equipment and installation 
will cost $198, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Service availability will be the most critical issue when it  
comes to winning this race,'' Gallemore said. ``ADSL is available, 
affordable, and has the technological attributes that make it the 
better choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other states in line for the service by the end of 1999 include  
Texas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Kansas and Arkansas. ADSL trials will 
begin in Connecticut later this month.

<HEADLINE> It May Be Hard for NBA After Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- It looks like doomsday has arrived after all.  
</P>
<P>
	Less than a week after the NBA pushed itself to the brink of  
disaster, the league was greeted with the sobering -- if not totally 
unexpected -- news that Michael Jordan is set to call it quits. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, calling it doomsday might be a bit of an exaggeration.  
The NBA has lost superstars before, and others have always come 
along afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, this is Jordan. The league's No. 1 draw, the most visible  
and popular athlete in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Losing him is different because Jordan wasn't just the latest in  
a long line of great players. He was the player who took what Magic 
Johnson and Larry Bird started and kept it going. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael will be missed,'' said Lenny Wilkens, a Hall of Famer  
both as a player and a coach. ``He's such a great player, such a 
great ambassador for the game. But the game is bigger than anybody. 
The game will go on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But first, Jordan will say goodbye.  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan and the Bulls planned a news conference today at the  
United Center, the Chicago arena where a bronze statue of His 
Airness stands outside. 
</P>
<P>
	The silence from the league office was deafening Tuesday, as  
commissioner David Stern and others decided to wait until Jordan 
makes it official. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern was expected to attend Jordan's news conference, the  
commissioner's first public appearance since last Thursday's news 
conference announcing an agreement to end the bitter six-month 
lockout and announcing the first steps toward trying to lure back 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Losing Jordan won't help.  
</P>
<P>
	It won't help the league, the Bulls, Jordan's old teammates or  
the television networks that paid $2.64 billion in broadcast rights 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have all been fortunate to have been a part of one of the  
most magical rides in sports history,'' said Dick Ebersol, NBC 
Sports chairman. ``While no single player can replace the most 
transcendent athlete of this decade, it will be exciting to see 
what players and what teams step in the spotlight for the fans to 
embrace in the next era.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That new generation, and some members of the Jordan generation,  
too, contains no one with the charisma and killer instinct, nor the 
records, that made Jordan so special. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the older players, including Karl Malone, Charles  
Barkley, Patrick Ewing and Reggie Miller, never defeated Jordan in 
the playoffs -- and they may never get over it. 
</P>
<P>
	Several younger stars are more known for their most infamous  
moments -- Grant Hill and Penny Hardaway for getting their coaches 
fired, Latrell Sprewell for choking his coach, Allen Iverson for 
his legal troubles, Kobe Bryant for his selfishness -- than for 
great victories. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sad for everyone to see the greatest basketball player in  
the world come to that conclusion,'' said Bird, whose arrival along 
with Johnson in 1979 began the NBA's transformation into a global 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	``There comes a time in every player's career that they have to  
make that decision, and he feels it's his time,'' added Bird, who 
retired as a player following the 1992 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Assuming Jordan confirms his expected retirement, it will bring  
an end to one of the most brilliant careers in league history. 
Without him, many fans just won't tune in any more, and his team 
most likely will struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Losers! Losers! Losers!'' Derrick Watt, a 32-year-old Chicago  
machinist and Bulls fan, said as he left Michael Jordan's 
Restaurant in Chicago. ``Without Michael, they'll be in the 
basement of their division.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jordan era included six NBA championships, five Most  
Valuable Player awards, 10 scoring titles, 12 All-Star appearances 
and countless other memorable moments -- from last-second shots to 
prolific scoring outbursts -- that epitomized his superiority. 
</P>
<P>
	He also transcended basketball, drawing even non-sports fans to  
watch him on television and in person. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight regular season Chicago Bulls games on NBC last season  
drew a 6.5 rating on average, while the 17 televised games without 
Jordan got a rating of 3.8 percent, down 71 percent. The four 
most-watched NBA Finals all include Jordan, with last season's 
finals drawing a record 18.7 rating. The two non-Jordan finals in 
'94 and '95 drew a 12.4 and 13.9 rating. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan also drew crowds more than any other player in history,  
selling out all home games and just about all road games. When he 
made what was expected to be his last trip to play in Atlanta last 
March, an NBA record 62,046 fans turned out to see him and the 
Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's the money. Fortune magazine in June estimated that  
Jordan's career financial contribution to the NBA was $10 billion. 
The league generates about $2 billion a year in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sad thing, where basketball is now, Michael Jordan is  
desperately needed. Some fans have probably been lost, and he could 
help bring them back,'' Lakers guard Eddie Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	When Jordan retired for the first time in 1993 and moved on to a  
short-lived professional baseball career, the league publicly said 
many of the same things it has been saying in the months leading up 
to Jordan's re-retirement: that it had survived the departures of 
Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Julius Erving 
and Johnson, and it would survive this, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone agrees.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think there will be a sag,'' said Pulitzer Prize-winning  
author David Halberstam, who followed the Bulls last season for a 
book. ``There are an awful lot of talented players out there, but 
Michael was unusual because he did all this so brilliantly and with 
consummate charm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not all of his linear successors have that charm, and that's  
going to be a problem for the NBA. The public not only wants to see 
great athletes, it wants to like them. It liked Magic, it liked 
Bird, it liked Jordan, but it's not sure if it likes these other 
guys.''

<HEADLINE> Will Bulls Be Dismantled? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Bring the rest of 'em back? Or allow the wrecking ball to come  
crashing down on the rest of the dynasty? 
</P>
<P>
	Those are the questions Chicago Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf and  
general manager Jerry Krause will have to answer. As of now, it 
looks like they're unsure which path they'll choose. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday night's news that Jordan is planning to retire will have  
a profound and immediate impact on the rest of Chicago Bulls. With 
only four players under contract and 10 free agents, the 
possibilities are many. 
</P>
<P>
	Should they re-sign Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman and try to  
build from there? And what about Steve Kerr, Jud Buechler, Luc 
Longley, Scott Burrell, Joe Kleine and Bill Wennington, the other 
free agents? 
</P>
<P>
	All could be expendable if the Bulls decide to completely  
rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
	But all of them could be back, too, if Reinsdorf and Krause  
think the team has a chance to be a champion without Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guys we have back are basically young,'' Krause said of  
the Bulls' four players under contract: Toni Kukoc, Ron Harper, 
Randy Brown and Keith Booth. ``(We would) add more youth to them 
and see where we go from there to build another championship team. 
We did that once before a number of years ago with youth, stayed 
with youth and added veterans as we went along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls technically will remain over the salary cap until they  
renounce their rights to Jordan. But once that happens, and if they 
decide not to keep Pippen and Rodman, they will be in position to 
immediately become a major player in a free-agent market that 
includes Antonio McDyess, Damon Stoudamire, Jerry Stackhouse and 
Rod Strickland. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want us to come in for a visit,'' James Bryant, the agent  
for McDyess, said today. ``We've talked with them, and right now 
Antonio is interested in looking at all the options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the agent for Rodman, a return by most of Jordan's  
supporting cast isn't out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
	``This means that Dennis will not be playing with Michael again,  
but everything else is up in the air,'' agent Dwight Manley said. 
``By saying their first priority was to bring the entire team back, 
I feel that demonstrated their sincerity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They still have to field a team, and there's a lot of  
possibilities as to how they could do it,'' Manley said. 
</P>
<P>
	How's this for an opening night lineup: Kukoc, Harper, Eddie  
Jones, Elden Campbell and McDyess? 
</P>
<P>
	It's not out of the question, and here's how it could happen:  
</P>
<P>
	Krause, the only executive able to sign Pippen to a contract  
worth more than $10 million annually, makes an agreement with 
Pippen's agent to sign him and trade him. Under the rules of the 
new collective bargaining agreement, such a transaction would be 
permissible if Pippen's new contract was for at least three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Krause then would trade Pippen to another team that could put  
together a package of players whose salaries would equal Pippen's. 
Campbell ($7 million) and Jones ($2.2 million) would put the Lakers 
in that ballpark, and since Los Angeles needs a ballhandler now 
that Nick Van Exel is gone, Pippen would be a perfect fit. 
</P>
<P>
	If such a trade were made, Krause would then have to decide  
whether to renounce the rights to Rodman and the other free agents 
to clear them off the salary cap. If none of them were taking up 
space, the Bulls would be close to having $9 million in cap room to 
offer McDyess. 
</P>
<P>
	If McDyess liked the idea of Chicago instead of Phoenix, Houston  
or Denver, it might work. 
</P>
<P>
	Krause first called McDyess' agent late last week to express  
interest, Bryant said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll consider all factors, but their interest is coming  
late,'' Bryant said. ``With no free market, no one can be 
considered a front-runner. Obviously, the Suns have the advantage 
on the numbers side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The roster could be filled out with a player taking the new  
average salary exception, another player taking the $1 million 
exception and four or five others playing for the minimum. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time opening night arrives, a majority of the players due  
to receive rings could be absent. 
</P>
<P>
	If Jordan shows up, he might not even recognize the Bulls.  
</P>
<P>
	First, it'll be up to the Jerrys to decide how much dismantling  
they'll do.

	MOBILE, Ala. (AP) -- Fire blamed on a badly vented dryer swept  
through an unlicensed home day care center, killing three children. 
</P>
<P>
	Four other children were hospitalized Monday along with the  
center's operator, Anita Perkins, who was credited with saving 
three children before she collapsed. One child, a 2-month-old girl, 
was in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``By the time I could get over there, Anita was throwing them  
babies out on the grass,'' said a neighbor, Donnie Carlton. 
</P>
<P>
	The dead children ranged in age from infancy to 5 years.  
</P>
<P>
	Fire Department spokesman Steve Huffman said today the fire  
apparently started in an electric clothes dryer that was not vented 
to the outside and may have allowed lint to accumulate on heating 
coils. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials said Ms. Perkins, a retired teacher, had  
obtained a license in 1991. However, she surrendered it in 1996 
because she planned to help her church start a day care center, 
said Frances Arnold of the Mobile County Department of Human 
Resources. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no comment from District Attorney John Tyson Jr. on  
whether any charges would be filed. He did not immediately return 
calls today. 
</P>
<P>
	The district attorney's office has the power to close a home  
operating without a license, said Mike Gibson of the Mobile County 
Department of Human Resources. In addition, operating without a 
license could bring a misdemeanor charge that includes a fine of up 
to $1,000 and a year in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Licensed homes are required to have smoke detectors and fire  
extinguishers.

<HEADLINE> Saddam Becomes More Agressive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has adopted a  
much more aggressive posture in recent weeks by nearly doubling the 
number of mobile surface-to-air missile sites in the northern and 
southern no-fly zones and using them to threaten U.S. and British 
planes. 
</P>
<P>
	As well, the Iraqi leader has sent warplanes into the two  
off-limit zones at least 66 times in the past two weeks, said a 
senior defense official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iraqi aircraft also seem to be employing tactics aimed at  
entrapping the U.S. and British warplanes keeping watch over most 
of Iraqi airspace, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of just one or two aircraft darting in and out of the  
no-fly zones in a cat-and-mouse game, U.S. and British warplanes 
now are being harassed by several aircraft at the same time -- such 
as an armed helicopter and a fighter plane, the official. 
</P>
<P>
	``Iraq previously used no-fly zone violations as a lure,'' the  
official said. ``Now, they seem to be used as a distraction,'' 
while other Iraqi planes approach from a different angle. This also 
may bring the allied aircraft within range of Saddam's 
anti-aircraft missile batteries. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's becoming much more aggressive'' with the type of tactics  
his military is employing, said the official, who has access to 
intelligence reports about the conditions U.S. and British aircraft 
face in the no-fly zones. 
</P>
<P>
	The northern no-fly zone was set up in 1991 north of the 36th  
parallel to keep Saddam from attacking Kurds with his aircraft. The 
southern zone was set up in 1992 to protect southern Shiite 
Muslims, and prohibit attacks against Iraq's southern neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the U.S. and British air attacks against Iraq in  
mid-December, the nine surface-to-air missile sites in the no-fly 
zones have increased to 17, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	The exact size of his arsenal isn't entirely clear, but the  
Iraqi leader is known to have some 110 operational missile 
launchers. U.S. officials said Tuesday they have been unable to 
account for 13 of those. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to the Persian Gulf War, Saddam had amassed about 7,000  
surface-to-air anti-aircraft missiles, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Saddam's surface-to-air missile batteries are mobile,  
and therefore nearly impossible to detect until they turn on their 
radar. In defense, U.S. and British aircraft fire anti-radiation 
missiles, which follow the radar beam to its source to destroy the 
missile battery. 
</P>
<P>
	In at least 12 cases in recent weeks, Iraqis have aimed missiles  
at the coalition aircraft, but often without turning on their radar 
so that the Iraqi sites can't be targeted. 
</P>
<P>
	No U.S. or British aircraft have been harmed in the latest  
encounters. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest confrontation early Tuesday, an F-16CJ patrolling  
the northern no-fly zone near Mosul encountered an active radar 
site, and fired a HARM anti-radiation missile at it. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Air Force aircraft returned to its base in Incirlik,  
Turkey, unharmed, and it is still unclear whether the missile took 
out the radar, said Pentagon spokesman Capt. Michael Doubleday. 
</P>
<P>
	Doubleday acknowledged the situation is far different now, in  
comparison to that in December, when the Iraqis put up no 
resistance to the four days of U.S. and British air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Iraqi approach has changed. Our reactions have been  
appropriate and responsive to the provocations,'' Doubleday said. 
'' What's changed in the last several weeks, is a decision 
evidently of Saddam Hussein, to challenge the no-fly zones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added that Iraq's ``overall goal'' is to ``get rid of all  
restrictions on Iraq, such as the sanctions imposed by the United 
Nations in the wake of the Persian Gulf War, and the inspections 
geared towards curbing Iraq's development of weapons of mass 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter what Saddam's intent, the spokesman added, the United  
States will continue to enforce the no-fly zones and take 
appropriate action to defend its air crews.

	Intel Profits Up 18 Pct.  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Intel's fourth-quarter profits rose 18 percent  
to easily beat Wall Street expectations, helped by strong demand 
for its pricier microprocessors used in powerful personal 
computers. The report was issued after the stock market closed. 
Intel also cautioned that revenue in the current quarter should 
drop from fourth-quarter levels due to a seasonal slump in sales of 
personal computers that typically follows the holiday buying 
season. Intel shares fell 4 3/16 to 135 9/16.

behind a new Web site it developed with Internet search engine 
Infoseek. The new Go Network site offers news, entertainment and 
services and helps direct visitors to other Internet locations, 
using Infoseek's search technology. Disney stock, which has been

	NEW YORK (AP) -- A tiny company that posts job openings on the  
Internet has committed 43 percent of its revenue to running a 
half-minute commercial on this month's Super Bowl telecast. 
HotJobs.com Ltd., has never advertised on TV, and its original 
commercial concept was rejected by the network as inappropriate. 
Its ad agency quit in the scramble for a new ad idea. Its $2 
million for a 30-second spot is already showing returns as it has 
been mentioned in numerous published accounts of who is advertising 
on the Super Bowl. The Fox network's rejection of the initial ad 
idea drew more free news coverage.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The judge who will decide the Microsoft  
antitrust case pointedly asked a government witness today whether 
the company is following a strategy of ``delayed gratification'' by 
keeping its software prices low. As the government prepared to end 
its case after 10 weeks at trial, the unexpected question posed by 
U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson asked why if the 
company wields such power in the high-tech industry, why doesn't it 
raise prices more? Microsoft shares fell 5 5/16 to 142 3/16.

break down regulatory barriers between financial industries, Sen. 
Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said today such a bill is now his highest

insisted something must be done about banks being forced to make

the result of community lending laws.

its global work force by about 18,000 jobs over the next three or 
four years, according to a published report today that the bank 
later denied. Chairman and chief executive Hugh McColl, in a 
meeting yesterday with editors and reporters from the San Francisco

	Brazil Says It Will Honor Debt

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Trying to calm investors,  
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said today that Brazil will 
honor all its foreign debt obligations. His comments, however, 
failed to stem losses on the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange. The market 
was still reeling after the governor of Minas Gerais, Itamar

	U.S. Warns Japan on Steel Imports  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- If Japan doesn't act quickly to halt a flood  
of cheap steel coming into the United States, it will face U.S. 
trade sanctions, the Clinton administration bluntly told Japan's 
top trade official Tuesday. But Japanese Trade Minister Kaoru 
Yosano insisted that his government could make no commitment to 
stem a flood of foreign steel although he said he expected those 
shipments to fall this year based on forecasts made by Japanese 
companies. 

</P>
<P>
	China Is World's Top Steel Producer  
</P>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- China remained the world's leading steel producer  
last year despite Asia's financial crisis, while the United States 
moved past Japan even as it complained about surging Japanese 
imports. Global output of crude steel slipped to 778.2 million 
tons, down 2.5 percent from a record 798.5 million tons in 1997, 
the U.N. Economic Commission for Europe reported.

	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- As oil-producing countries try to cut  
excess global production, Iraq today announced plans to raise its 
output. Iraq hopes to boost production to 3 million barrels per day 
from the current 2.5 million barrels, and to 3.5 million barrels 
within two years. Faleh al-Khayat, the Oil Ministry's 
director-general of planning, said the increase was contingent upon 
receiving spare parts for the country's ailing oil industry, 
battered by more than eight years of U.N. trade sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Aides Oppose Spy Clemency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Several of President Clinton's top national  
security aides are steering him away from granting clemency to 
Jonathan Pollard, the former Navy intelligence official who spied 
for Israel in the 1980s and is now serving a life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House had set Monday as the date for receiving  
recommendations and information from the departments of state, 
defense and justice as well as the CIA and other intelligence 
agencies on the Pollard case. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials speaking privately said it was possible  
Clinton would wait weeks or even months before deciding the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will review the information in a timely fashion. The  
president may ask for additional information. He may have 
additional questions,'' said David Leavy, spokesman for the White 
House National Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior U.S. official said Secretary of State Madeleine  
Albright has told Clinton there are ``no compelling foreign policy 
considerations'' to justify releasing Pollard. Albright's views, 
combined with the known views of other senior Clinton aides, could 
seal Pollard's fate, despite a request by Israel that he be granted 
clemency. 
</P>
<P>
	CIA Director George Tenet reportedly reiterated -- as he did last  
October -- that he would resign if Pollard were set free, according 
to officials, who declined to comment on the matter publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen was out of the country Monday,  
but his chief spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, told reporters last week 
that the Defense Department has been on record before as strongly 
opposing Pollard's release. ``I don't expect any change from that 
position,'' said Bacon. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the Justice Department's criminal division and the FBI  
adamantly oppose clemency. Justice and FBI officials believe 
Pollard has never fully cooperated in assessing what secrets he 
sold the Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials declined to characterize the views of  
Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pollard question almost derailed a U.S.-brokered  
Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement reached in October during talks 
at Wye River Plantation in Maryland. Under last-minute pressure 
from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Clinton promised to 
take a fresh look at clemency for Pollard even though two previous 
reviews of the case, also requested by the Israeli government, 
found no grounds to commute his sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Those urging Pollard's early release, including the Israeli  
government, argue that his admitted acts of providing U.S. secrets 
to Israel did no real damage to American national security. An 
article published Monday in the New Yorker magazine, however, 
paints a different picture. 
</P>
<P>
	The article, by investigative reporter Seymour M. Hersh, says  
Pollard did far more damage to American national security that has 
ever been made known to the American public. Hersh reports, for 
example, that Pollard betrayed elements of four major U.S. 
intelligence systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The article alleges that Pollard gave Israel vast amounts of  
data dealing with how specific American intelligence systems 
worked. For example, he allegedly provided details of an exotic 
capability that American spy satellites have of taking ``off-axis'' 
photographs from space. While orbiting the earth in one direction, 
the satellites could photograph areas that were seemingly out of 
range in another direction. Pollard also passed along other 
detailed information on ways in which U.S. agencies spied on 
Israel, Hersh reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pollard's handing over of the data had a clear impact, the  
expert told me, for `we could see the whole process' -- of 
intelligence collection -- `slowing down,''' Hersh wrote. He added 
that the disclosures also hindered U.S. ability to recruit foreign 
agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, interviewed today on  
Israel Radio, said of Pollard: ``This man did something that 
shouldn't have been done, and the government of Israel did 
something that shouldn't have been done by sending him there, but 
because we admitted our mistake, and there's a human issue of 
someone who is rotting in jail, and we simply have to return him. 
He acted in the service of Israel. Israel must bring him home as in 
other circumstances in which we bring our people home.''

<HEADLINE> Steel Industry Faces Hurdles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Disappointed at President Clinton's refusal to  
take stronger action to block cheap steel imports, the president of 
the largest steelworkers union says he'll look for help in 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers from steel-producing states stand ready to aid a union  
that contributed more than $1 million to congressional campaigns 
since 1997. But even the most ardent supporters acknowledge that 
success will be difficult and may come too late to be useful. 
</P>
<P>
	Mindful of the growing political pressure, Commerce Secretary  
William Daley and U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky 
held what both described as blunt talks today with Japanese Trade 
Minister Kaoru Yosano. The U.S. officials emphasizes that the 
administration will not hesitate on its threat to impose quotas on 
Japanese steel exports into the United States unless those 
shipments show a quick decline this year following a surge of more 
than 400 percent in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Describing the talks as ``very frank and quite blunt,''  
Barshefsky told reporters afterward, ``It is not secret that trade 
tensions between the United States and Japan are increasing quite 
dramatically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Yosano told reporters at a separate briefing that  
he repeated forecasts by Japanese steel companies that based on 
market conditions they expect their shipments to the United States 
this year to drop back to the levels in existence before the Asian 
crisis hit. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he stressed that did not constitute a commitment on the  
part of the government of Japan to pressure its domestic industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., a conservative with a large labor  
constituency, said that ``trade is a very controversial subject in 
Congress. ... There's the left that would like to see quotas, the 
middle that would like to see a more reasonable piece of 
legislation and the right who want nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia, the Democratic chairman  
of the Senate steel caucus, said lawmakers from the 16 states that 
produce steel are not numerous enough to overcome a propensity 
toward free-trade policies. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to assume that any getting-tougher-on-trade  
legislation in the Republican Congress is going to have a hard 
time,'' said Rockefeller, who had considered the White House his 
last bastion of hope. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Clinton released his plan for combating the tide of  
steel imports into the United States in the wake of the Asian 
economic crisis. Domestic steel producers and union leaders 
immediately derided the plan as inadequate to avert additional 
plant closures and layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry officials say the surge in imports, which reached  
record levels in 1998, has already resulted in at least 10,000 
layoffs and a handful of company bankruptcies. 
</P>
<P>
	George Becker, the president of the United Steelworkers of  
America, said in a letter Friday to Clinton that the union now has 
``no choice but to work with our supporters in Congress ... to pass 
into law the absolutely vital relief which the administration is 
apparently unwilling to provide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The union specifically wants quotas to restrict imports to  
pre-crisis levels. Other legislation in the works would ban imports 
for up to a year, clarify courts' ability to issue injunctive 
relief, give the industry a share of the tariffs collected from 
imports and ease standards for proving harm and winning cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve steel producers and two unions already have filed trade  
complaints accusing Japan, Russia and Brazil of illegally dumping 
steel in the United States at prices dramatically below production 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	But because rulings are not expected until the summer, the  
domestic industry has been pressing the Clinton administration to 
take more immediate action, including reviews that could lead to 
quotas or broad tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
	But passage of any legislation generally takes months or years,  
if ever. And then it would have to have the president's signature. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's going to be an awful lot of noise made, but  
ultimately we're part of a world trading system,'' said David 
Phelps, executive director for the American Institute for 
International Steel, which represents steel importers and 
exporters. ``Cooler heads in the end will prevail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trent Duffy, a spokesman for the House Ways and Means Committee,  
said the release of Clinton's plan actually diminishes the chances 
for passing legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president has just said he wouldn't support those  
protectionist types of measures that some might be seeking,'' Duffy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton did offer more moderate proposals, including $300  
million in tax breaks for steel producers. 
</P>
<P>
	The House in October passed a non-binding resolution calling for  
a one-year ban on imports from some countries. House members hope 
to build on that overwhelming majority with binding legislation, 
but they face obstacles from the House leadership and the 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Marcone, chief of staff to Rep. Jim Traficant, D-Ohio, said  
members of the House steel caucus are considering ways to tie up 
House proceedings until a vote on steel legislation is allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	Although such a measure faces a Clinton veto, Marcone said, it  
would at least serve to pressure administration officials, 
particularly Vice President Al Gore as the 2000 presidential 
campaign approaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Hank Barnette, chairman and chief executive of Bethlehem Steel  
Corp., said steel producers and unions are likely to step up their 
educational campaign aimed at pressuring the administration and 
Congress. The coalition has already spent several million dollars 
on ads, rallies and other publicity. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must carry the message of our industry,'' Barnette said.  
``We want to put the facts right on the record so that any 
objective person will conclude that we need help.''

<HEADLINE> Deranged Air Passenger Convicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A man who called himself Jesus and blessed  
fellow airline passengers by tapping them on the head with a pillow 
has been convicted of assaulting a flight attendant when he was 
told to sit down. 
</P>
<P>
	Dean Trammel, 22, was found guilty in a non-jury trial Tuesday  
and could get up to 20 years in prison at sentencing April 9. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Catherine Blake agreed with Trammel's  
lawyers that he is mentally ill but said he knew right from wrong 
at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``This young man needs help and he needs treatment,'' Blake  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trammel was a passenger on a US Airways flight from Los Angeles  
to Baltimore in 1997 when he began roaming the aisles. 
</P>
<P>
	He told a flight attendant that God had ordered him to remain  
standing during landing. When a crew member ordered Trammel to sit 
down, flight attendant Renee Sheffer testified, he threw Ms. 
Sheffer across two rows of seats. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said it took four men to control Trammel as he  
thrashed and tried to bite those holding him. He was tied up for 
the rest of the flight with seat belts, plastic handcuffs and an 
airline necktie. 
</P>
<P>
	Trammel's lawyers argued that Trammel should be found not  
criminally responsible, the equivalent of an insanity defense. 
</P>
<P>
	A psychiatrist for the defense testified that Trammel had been  
diagnosed with manic depression and was having a ``manic episode'' 
during the flight. A prosecution psychiatrist agreed only that 
Trammel had lost ``some'' touch with reality.

<HEADLINE> Starbucks To Acquire Tea Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Tazo, an Oregon company that once aspired  
to be the Starbucks of teas, has been bought out by Starbucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle-based Starbucks hopes that with Tazo it can attract new  
customers. The company will discontinue its in-house Infusia brand 
of tea, which currently accounts for just 1 percent of Starbucks' 
$1.3 billion in annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tea will drive more people into our stores, and I think this  
is the highest-quality tea in the nation,'' said Howard Schultz, 
Starbucks chairman and chief executive officer. ``It's a much-loved 
brand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tazo should be available in Starbucks stores by the end of the  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Tazo calls itself ``The Reincarnation of Tea'' on its labels and  
cultivates a quirky image. The ingredients listing, for example, 
says each tea bag includes ``the mumbled chantings of a certified 
tea shaman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tazo is sold in tea bags, in leaves and bottled as iced tea. Its  
blends include minty Refresh, chamomile-based Calm, citrus Wild 
Sweet Orange, and Passion, billed as a blend of hibiscus and other 
tropical flowers and herbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Smith, who founded Tazo in 1994, would not disclose what  
Starbucks paid for Tazo.

<HEADLINE> Rubin Won't Change Dollar Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin insisted today  
that there has been no change in the administration's policy of 
supporting a strong dollar, despite the fact that the U.S. currency 
fell this week to a 28-month low against the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar reached the against the yen on Monday, extending a  
slump that has seen the American currency lose one-third of its 
value against the yen since hitting a high this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	But the dollar was staging a strong rally today, boosted by  
reports that the Bank of Japan was intervening to sell yen and buy 
dollars to halt the dollar's slide. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin would not comment directly on reports that Japan was  
intervening to support the dollar, but he did say: ``I'll just 
repeat what I've said so often, which is a strong dollar has served 
us well and our dollar policy is absolutely unchanged.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin spoke to reporters outside Blair House, the government's  
official guest residence, after a meeting with Argentine President 
Carlos Menem. 
</P>
<P>
	American manufacturers have been pushing the administration to  
let the dollar fall in value, arguing that it will require a weaker 
U.S. currency to deal with a U.S. trade deficit that is expected to 
hit an all-time high of $167 billion for 1998 and climb even higher 
in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The weaker currency makes American products cheaper and more  
competitive on overseas markets while making imported goods more 
expensive for American consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	But a strong dollar has helped to keep inflation at bay in the  
United States and low inflation has given the Federal Reserve the 
maneuvering room to cut interest rates, cuts that helped to spur a 
rebound in the stock market last fall and provide momentum for the 
U.S. economy.

<HEADLINE> `Providence' Spurs NBC to Victory / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Providence was the word at NBC, as  
``Providence'' premiered with heavenly ratings and the network won 
the week overall. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC may have a much-needed hit on its hands with this  
replacement for its instant Friday failure ``Trinity.'' On the 
opener, ``Providence'' scored eighth place with a 13.1 household 
rating. It was the best premiere showing by an NBC drama since 
``ER'' in September 1994, the network said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another new show, Fox's Eddie Murphy-created ``The PJs,'' took  
13th place with a 12.6 rating in its Sunday preview airing, to 
become Sunday's most-watched show on any network. This week the 
animated comedy settles in its regular Tuesday slot. 
</P>
<P>
	Two returning series, CBS' ``The Magnificent Seven'' and NBC's  
``Lateline,'' didn't fare so well, socked with 57th and 71st place 
rankings respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	In prime time for the week of Jan. 4 through 10, NBC logged a  
winning 9.8 rating and 15 share, according to Nielsen Media 
Research figures released Tuesday. CBS edged out ABC for second 
place, with a 9.5 rating and 15 share. ABC had a 9.4 rating and 15 
share. Fox (programming 15 hours) had a 7.7 rating and 12 share. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the emerging networks, the WB had a 2.8 rating and 4  
share, while UPN remained behind with a 1.9 rating and 3 share. The 
Pax network had a .7 rating and 1 share. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. Share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the 16-week-old 1998-99 season, CBS is first-place with a  
9.1 rating season-to-date. NBC is runner-up with an 8.7, while ABC 
is 8.5 and Fox 7.1. 
</P>
<P>
	In the evening news derby, ``NBC Nightly News'' retained the top  
spot with a 9.5 rating and 17 share. ABC's ``World News Tonight'' 
was second with a 9.1 rating and 17 share. ``The CBS Evening News'' 
was third with an 8.9 rating and 16 share. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of Jan. 4-10, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
household ratings were: ``ER,'' NBC, 21.7; ``Friends,'' NBC, 17.6; 
Fiesta Bowl: Florida State vs. Tennessee, ABC, 17.2; ``Frasier,'' 
NBC, 16.9; ``Just Shoot Me,'' NBC, 15.7; ``Veronica's Closet,'' 
NBC, 14.7; Fox NFC Playoff: Arizona at Minnesota, Fox, 14.5; 
``Providence,'' NBC, 13.1; ``People's Choice Awards,'' CBS, and 
``60 Minutes,'' CBS, tied at 12.9.

<HEADLINE> In Mexico, Pope May Talk Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Pope John Paul II is expected to discuss  
human rights and racism during a visit to Mexico next week, but 
will try to avoid discussing specific conflicts, Roman Catholic 
church officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the pope will visit only Mexico City and St. Louis  
during his Jan. 22-27 trip, church officials said his mission is 
continent-wide because the main purpose is to sign a document 
drafted during a 1997 meeting of bishops from across the Americas. 
</P>
<P>
	But some church officials said John Paul wouldn't be able to  
avoid speaking out on Mexico's troubles, such as the simmering 
uprising in the southern state of Chiapas, whose guerrillas have 
found sympathy among some religious leaders for their fight against 
the oppression of poor Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's obvious that Chiapas has taken on not only a national,  
but also an international dimension,'' Monsignor Avelardo Alvarado, 
secretary-general of the Mexican Episcopal Conference, said at a 
news conference. ``Even if he doesn't mention it by name, it will 
be implicit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to think that the Holy Father will talk about the  
conflicts in the Americas, about human rights, about justice and 
peace, about priority attention to indigenous and African-American 
people and of course within all that goes the situation in 
Chiapas,'' he added later in comments to The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	But other church officials said the pope would take pains to  
avoid condemning any government or any group. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pope is not a judicial authority in any country of the  
world,'' Papal Nuncio Justo Mullor said sternly. ``The pope is not 
coming to bring you an encyclopedia in which he talks about the 
problems each of you have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During his visit to Mexico -- his fourth -- John Paul will make  
appearances at the Basilica of the Virgin of Guadalupe, at a 
racetrack and at a soccer stadium. He also will meet with Mexican 
President Ernesto Zedillo and Mexico City Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas 
and visit a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 1 million people are expected to attend the three public  
events, and millions more are expected to line the streets to catch 
a glimpse of the passing popemobile or to watch the events on 
giant-screen televisions being erected around Mexico.

<HEADLINE> GOP Ties Larry Flynt to White House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans suggested Tuesday that the White  
House may be involved in Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt's 
efforts to brand Georgia Rep. Bob Barr -- one of the House 
impeachment managers -- as a hypocrite for his past personal 
conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``If that's the best he can do, the White House ought to get  
another agent,'' said Rep. John Linder, R-Ga., a former chairman of 
the National Republican Campaign Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Republicans should  
produce evidence or ``knock it off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson said James  
Carville, one of President Clinton's longtime supporters, may be 
linked to Flynt's attempt to use legal proceedings from Barr's 1986 
divorce to embarrass him just days before he's scheduled to help 
present the House case against Clinton in his Senate impeachment 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``When General Carville declared war on the president's enemies,  
private Flynt enlisted,'' said Nicholson. 
</P>
<P>
	Carville denied any involvement with Flynt and said he hasn't  
spoken to him in over a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have anything to do with it,'' he said. ``I think it's  
stupid to look into people's sex lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart denied any White House link to Flynt.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's an absolutely baseless charge,'' he said. ``And at some  
point, there ought to be a price to pay for making baseless charges 
and practicing the politics of innuendo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said Clinton repeatedly has denounced the ``politics of  
personal destruction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Nicholson nor Linder offered any evidence to support  
their claim of White House involvement in Flynt's crusade, which 
started with a $1 million offer last fall for evidence of sexual 
misconduct by top political leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Flynt released a Jan. 8 affidavit from Barr's former wife -- the  
publisher admits he paid her for the affidavit -- in which she says 
she believes he was having an affair in the mid 1980s with a woman 
who is now his present wife. She based the allegation largely on 
1986 depositions from Barr and his present wife in which both 
refused to answer questions about their relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	Gail Vogel Barr, who was divorced from the congressman in  
November 1986, also says in the affidavit that he did not try to 
discourage her from having an abortion in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Barr, who switched his views from pro-choice to anti-abortion  
during a 1992 campaign for the Senate, said in a statement he 
``never suggested, urged, forced or encouraged anyone to have an 
abortion.'' He also said he had ``never perjured myself'' in a 
court proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
	Interviewed on CNN, Barr said Tuesday night that Flynt's  
accusations were ``a thinly veiled effort by the president's 
defenders to detract us from'' presenting the House's impeachment 
case in the Senate. He said both he and Clinton had three options 
in their affidavits: tell the truth, assert a privilege under law 
or lie. 
</P>
<P>
	``One difference between Bill Clinton and I is that he chose  
that last one; he lied,'' Barr said. He declined to be more 
specific about any role he may have had in his former wife's 
abortion.

<HEADLINE> Moon May Not Be Back in Seattle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- New Seahawks coach Mike Holmgren reportedly has  
decided that quarterback Warren Moon won't return to Seattle next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Moon will be released Feb. 12, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Moon's agent said it was the first he and Moon had heard about  
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Seahawks spokesman Dave Pearson also said he was unaware of the  
situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Warren has not been informed that this is the case,'' agent  
Leigh Steinberg said from his California office. ``He's ready, 
willing and able to help Seattle, and we're expecting that's what 
will happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moon signed a two-year contract in August after the first  
holdout of his 15-year NFL career. The newspaper reported that an 
early release would require him to repay half of his $562,000 
signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a half -- it's a quarter, if that would happen,''  
Steinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he insisted it's not.  
</P>
<P>
	At 42, ``there hasn't been any dropoff in Warren's performance  
level,'' Steinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper, without citing sources, said Holmgren had decided  
the Seahawks can't tie up Moon's salary -- he'd count nearly $5 
million against the salary cap -- as a backup player. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg rejected the characterization of Moon as a backup.  
</P>
<P>
	``Warren Moon will be competitive for the starting job in  
Seattle,'' he said. ``We've heard nothing about this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moon wants to play another season, but only if he can challenge  
for the starting job. He ended this season as No. 2 behind Jon 
Kitna.

<HEADLINE> Gay Renominated for Ambassadorship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton has renominated James Hormel  
as ambassador to Luxembourg, and a White House official said 
Tuesday the administration hopes ``fairness will prevail'' in the 
new Congress so he can be approved for the job. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate last year refused to vote on the nomination of Hormel  
after several conservative Republicans accused him of promoting 
homosexual views. The White House accused lawmakers of prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
	Hormel, who is gay, was approved by the Senate Foreign Relations  
Committee, but Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., didn't 
allow his nomination to come to the floor in the face of scattered 
GOP objections. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Toiv, a White House spokesman, expressed confidence Hormel  
would be approved by the full Senate this year because a majority 
back the 66-year-old San Francisco philanthropist and heir to the 
Hormel Meat Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had the support of over 60 senators for the nomination in  
the last Congress and we felt that it was unfair that his 
nomination was not brought to the floor for a vote,'' Toiv said. 
``But we are hopeful that in the new Congress fairness will prevail 
and he will have a chance to have his nomination voted up or down. 
He is very well-qualified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hormel's renomination was first reported in Tuesday's editions  
of the San Francisco Chronicle. 
</P>
<P>
	Toiv said Hormel was among a number of renominations Clinton  
submitted to the new Congress, which began its work this month. 
</P>
<P>
	If approved, Hormel would be the first openly gay U.S. envoy.  
</P>
<P>
	Christian right groups had attacked Hormel, a vocal supporter of  
gay rights and AIDS causes, over his sponsorship of a gay and 
lesbian center at the San Francisco Public Library that bears his 
name. Republican critics called some of the material obscene and 
feared Hormel might promote a ``gay agenda'' as ambassador to the 
tiny European nation. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the Senate last year, however, Hormel said he had  
no control over the books in the library and he rejected the notion 
he would promote gay rights while representing the United States 
overseas. He also promised not to bring his partner to Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
	Hormel must go through the entire nomination process again,  
including approval at the committee level before a Senate vote.

<HEADLINE> Eight Freshmen Get Senate Baptism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Talk about hitting the ground running. Eight  
freshmen have launched their Senate careers by plunging directly 
into the presidential impeachment trial even before moving into 
their permanent offices. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of like playing in the World Series without having  
gone through the rest of the season, let alone going through spring 
training,'' said one of them, Sen. Peter Fitzgerald, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a quick way to make you understand that you're a part of  
one of the most important bodies in the world,'' said another 
newcomer, Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio. ``I get goose bumps 
thinking about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Normally, Fitzgerald, Voinovich and their six newly minted  
colleagues would be spending a relatively leisurely January 
focusing on hiring staff, house-hunting and learning the ways of 
the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, they have stepped straight into the vortex of a  
constitutional, political and media maelstrom, their schedules 
bulging with meetings, interview requests and time for poring over 
stacks of legal documents. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's intense,'' said Sen. Evan Bayh, D-Ind., his state's  
former governor. ``It's more than I was used to as governor, except 
in truly critical moments. I assume this is more than normal, but I 
have nothing to compare it to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How busy are they? Voinovich canceled plans to return to Ohio  
last weekend to attend swearing-in ceremonies for state officials. 
Fitzgerald did the same, and has so far limited most interviews to 
Chicago-area news organizations to avoid being overwhelmed. And 
Sen. Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark., a former House member who returned to 
Arkansas two years ago, has been staying with friends because she 
has had little time to search for a home for her family. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfailingly, the freshmen speak of the responsibility they bear  
and the awe they feel as jurors as the Senate considers whether to 
remove President Clinton from office. Only one other group of 
senators has performed this task: In 1868, when President Andrew 
Johnson was acquitted by a single vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``You really think: `What will my grandchildren read about  
this?''' said Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, she is among four of the eight newcomers who previously  
served in the House and had at least indirect knowledge of what it 
would be like serving in the new chamber. Besides Lincoln, they are 
Sens. Jim Bunning, R-Ky.; Mike Crapo, R-Idaho; and Charles Schumer, 
D-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd rather be talking about the issues I ran on, like  
education and crime,'' said Schumer, who served on the House 
Judiciary Committee that issued the articles of impeachment against 
Clinton last month. ``I don't like having to do this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the others served in public office at home: Bayh;  
Voinovich, who was governor; and Fitzgerald, who was a state 
senator. While they are used to the give-and-take of politics, they 
are having to familiarize themselves with the national stage on 
which they are now players. 
</P>
<P>
	Fitzgerald has a degree in classics from Dartmouth University  
and wrote his senior thesis on Cicero, the Roman orator. Yet he 
says he has been awed by the Senate's sense of tradition, and his 
fellow senators' knowledge of history. 
</P>
<P>
	After listening recently to 40-year Senate veteran Robert Byrd,  
D-W.Va., who regularly inserts historical references into his floor 
speeches, ``I took out an old college history text book, and I've 
been plowing through it,'' Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one of the eight is new to government: Sen. John Edwards,  
D-N.C., a successful trial attorney. Edwards says he is spending 80 
percent to 90 percent of his time dealing with impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no way we'd have time to spend on administrative  
things, legislative things,'' Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
	As was true for his colleagues, Edwards was asked often about  
impeachment during his campaign. Because of that and his lawyer's 
instincts for learning detail, he says he followed the case closely 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But that wasn't true for all of them. Voinovich says he was too  
busy to keep abreast of the details. At a recent dinner with his 
three grown children, he found that ``my kids know so much more 
about this than I do,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	There is one area in which the newcomers are even with most of  
their more experienced colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having been an executive, not a legislator, I'm not familiar  
with many of the procedural motions'' in the Senate's little-used 
impeachment process, said Bayh, the former governor. ``But then 
again, many of the other senators aren't, either.''

<HEADLINE> Daryl Johnston May Go to Cleveland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- There could be ``Moooooose'' calls coming  
from the Dog Pound this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Daryl Johnston, a fullback so popular his nickname is often  
cheered on the road, will be available to Cleveland in the Feb. 9 
expansion draft. Should he wind up with the Browns, the blue-collar 
player would likely become a quick favorite of the rowdy home 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston has spent his entire 10-year career with the Dallas  
Cowboys, winning three Super Bowls while opening holes for Emmitt 
Smith and making the Pro Bowl twice. He was rewarded before the 
1997 season with a five-year contract and a $2 million signing 
bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	But as Johnston heads into the third year of the deal, his base  
pay jumps to $1.25 million and he counts $1.65 million against the 
contract. With the Cowboys having to plug many holes, team 
owner-general manager Jerry Jones doesn't appear willing to commit 
that much to someone who is essentially a sixth lineman. 
</P>
<P>
	So on Tuesday morning, Jones called Johnston's agent, Leigh  
Steinberg, with an offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Daryl was sort of given a choice: cut his salary dramatically  
or put him on the list,'' Steinberg said. ``It was somewhat of a 
surprise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By exposing Johnston, Jones is playing hardball. If Johnston  
doesn't get taken by Cleveland -- which could always draft him just 
to trade him elsewhere -- then the fullback and his agent know they 
must be prepared to renegotiate with Dallas or risk being waived. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether he agrees with it or not, I know he understands the  
things we took into consideration on this decision,'' Jones said. 
``I will reiterate this was a difficult decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg said Johnston was being ``philosophical'' about the  
predicament. 
</P>
<P>
	``He understand this is today's NFL,'' Steinberg said. ``His  
preference is to stay with the Cowboys on this contract, but if 
Cleveland picks him, he'll graciously go and give them his best 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``But hopefully he'll end up with the Cowboys and end his career  
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston, who turns 33 the day after the expansion draft,  
re-established himself as one of the league's top blocking 
fullbacks this past season, less than a year having potentially 
career-ending neck surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston played 149 straight games before suffering the bulging  
disk. It's an impressive streak for someone who is primarily a 
human battering ram. That toughness, along with a humble attitude, 
has made him one of the team's most popular players on and off the 
field. He's also involved with several local charities, including a 
high-profile literacy campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Other players exposed by Dallas are receiver Billy Davis, center  
Clay Shiver and defensive ends Antonio Anderson and Hurvin 
McCormack. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland will stock its roster with between 30 and 42 players  
from a pool of 150 offered by the existing 30 NFL teams. No team 
will lose more than two players and some clubs won't lose any. 
After the Browns chose one player from a team, the club gets to 
pull another off the list. 
</P>
<P>
	Much-maligned cornerback Kevin Smith was a somewhat surprising  
omission, as were expensive veterans such as tight end Eric 
Bjornson and linebacker Fred Strickland.

<HEADLINE> Photographers Want Trial Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The second impeachment trial in the nation's  
history should not take place without a photo record, news 
photographers say in urging the Senate to make an exception to its 
rule banning photographers from the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
	The congressional Standing Committee of Press Photographers on  
Tuesday asked news executives to urge Senate leaders to change the 
rules. Without that, ``there will be no photos of any kind 
available from inside the Senate chamber.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The committee also sent out letters to all 100 senators and  
appealed to the Rules Committee, chaired by Sen. Mitch McConnell, 
R-Ky., which must initiate any rule change. 
</P>
<P>
	John Czwartacki, spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent  
Lott, R-Miss., said the senators ``understand all the arguments'' 
for giving access to photographers during the Senate trial, but 
``it's not our call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rules Committee officials said they wouldn't make a decision  
until after reviewing the photographers' request. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, when Chief Justice William Rehnquist and the senators  
were sworn in for the trial, officials allowed Senate staff 
photographers into the chamber, with their photos later distributed 
to news organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	But news organizations said the photos didn't meet newspaper  
standards, and not even official Senate photographers will be 
permitted to cover the actual trial when it begins on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decision banning photo coverage of the trial means that  
newspapers around the world will be denied a visual record of this 
historic event, the first presidential impeachment trial in more 
than a century,'' said Fred Sweets, the AP assistant Washington 
bureau chief for photos. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Kent, supervisor of the Senate Press Photographers Gallery,  
said that under current rules even a request to photograph the 
empty chamber was denied. He said photographers were encountering 
senators' concerns that they would not be able to exercise the 
control over news photo coverage that they do over C-Span. 
</P>
<P>
	The cameras used for C-Span television coverage of the House and  
Senate are operated by employees of Congress and are almost always 
focused on the person speaking on the floor.

<HEADLINE> Grind Can Eat Up Football Coaches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- These should be the best of times for  
Bill Parcells. He should be riding an emotional tidal wave straight 
out to Denver for the AFC Championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Parcells looks tired, at times even weary of the grind  
that can eat up football coaches. During his news conference on 
Monday, as he reflected on the Jets' 34-24 victory over 
Jacksonville that moved this usually beleaguered franchise within 
one win of its first Super Bowl in 30 years, Parcells eyes 
sometimes seemed glassy. He hadn't slept much -- he rarely does 
during a season, and especially in the playoffs -- and he wasn't his 
normal, bombastic self. In fact, Parcells seemed almost subdued at 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	Is this how a man within sight of his fourth Super Bowl  
appearance and an unprecedented third with a different franchise 
(Giants, Patriots and Jets) is expected to act? 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, it is on to the next thing, and that is what is sad,''  
Parcells said, reflecting on the stressful, insanely competitive 
nature of his job. ``Success is never final. Never. There is always 
more to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can be arduous. It is hard work to get to where you are  
now. You've got to reteach your team every week, because its a new 
environment every week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To emphasize the inability to truly enjoy the process of  
competing for a championship, Parcells spoke of his meeting with 
Jacksonville coach Tom Coughlin long after Sunday's game. He saw 
his close friend and former assistant in the parking lot at Giants 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked to him very briefly,'' Parcells said. ``He said, `Do  
you believe my guy trying to lateral?' And I said, `Did you see our 
guy not covering at the half?' And he said, `Did you believe our 
guy trying to run out of the end zone?' 
</P>
<P>
	``We both said that is what the kids do nowadays.''  
</P>
<P>
	The kids Parcells is coaching have given him much satisfaction,  
which he readily admits. Of course, Parcells is putting more and 
more time into getting the best out of them. Often, he's in his 
office by sunrise. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have your own things that elevate your standards and you  
try to go on to the next thing,'' he said. ``Or else you will have 
others elevating your standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is more pressure to win now (and) on ownership to change  
things; it's `Look what we're doing to make things better.' They 
should add a maybe to that ... maybe better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes it seems Parcells longs for the days when he could  
devote all of his time to teaching -- and that he could count on 
having the same players to teach, game after game, season after 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a different era in football,'' he said. ``Every  
industry in our society has changed a lot, they are more transient. 
It is not unlike what is typical of industry in this country, and 
people are going to change jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is unfair to compare what was before. Before free agency,  
you could develop players. The teams in those days, hardly anyone 
coaching one team knew anybody coaching the other team. You really 
didn't know the people, and now you have so much more interaction. 
I don't think it is fair to compare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At other times, he sort of relishes the challenges of today and  
the machinery in place to solve the ills of a team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I go back to my friend, Stick Michael,'' he said of the former  
baseball general manager, ``and that advice he gave me is as good 
as any I got: It is not about getting a superstar here and there, 
but about putting together a team so your needs are met, not the 
public's needs or the media's needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not window-dressing, that is not what you need to do.  
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, I needed a center, and so I had to try to get a  
center. And we got a center (free agent Kevin Mawae, who had a 
superb year).'' 
</P>
<P>
	He could probably use some rest, but that won't be coming for  
awhile. So he plows on, brightened a bit by the Jets' impressive 
accomplishments just two years after going 1-15. And three months 
after beginning the season 0-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Back then, did he think a spot in the AFC title game possible?  
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' he admitted. ``I didn't even know if the next week would  
be possible.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Gramm Focuses on Bank Overhaul Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A few months after blocking legislation to  
break down regulatory barriers between financial industries, Sen. 
Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said Tuesday such a bill is now his highest 
priority as the new Senate Banking Committee chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gramm insisted something must be done about banks being  
forced to make ``kickbacks and bribes'' to activist groups, a 
practice he says is the result of community lending laws. 
</P>
<P>
	With the defeat in November of Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., the  
banking panel's former chairman, proponents of the sweeping 
legislation had feared Gramm's takeover could bring the demise of 
the measure. It would remove Depression-era walls between the 
banking, securities and insurance industries and let them get more 
deeply into each other's businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm's opposition to the 1977 community lending laws led him to  
block the financial overhaul legislation in the Senate's waning 
days late last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first public statements on banking issues since becoming  
chairman, Gramm appeared to soften his earlier insistence on a 
repeal of the lending laws, which require financial institutions to 
lend to the poor and minorities in their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, though, Gramm said lawmakers need to come up  
with a ``temporary solution'' to what he sees as a menacing 
problem: banks forced to make ``cash payments, kickbacks and 
bribes'' to community activists in return for them dropping their 
opposition to the banks' proposed mergers with other financial 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	The practice ``is little more than extortion,'' Gramm told a  
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The best short-term solution, he suggested, would be to bar  
banks from making cash payments to low-income groups. 
</P>
<P>
	But John Taylor, president and chief executive officer of the  
National Community Reinvestment Coalition, said such improper 
payments to activist groups are ``as rare as a hound's tooth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Laying out his legislative priorities, Gramm said he was  
determined to act swiftly on the financial overhaul bill, aiming 
for its approval by the Banking Committee by the end of February. 
That would be an extremely accelerated timetable for the Senate -- 
even if it weren't tied up by the impeachment trial of President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he (Gramm) set a very bold and ambitious timetable,''  
said Paul Schosberg, president of America's Community Bankers. ``On 
the other hand, why not? ... He's a very smart guy who knows how 
political processes work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm said the overhaul legislation was needed to keep pace with  
a rapidly changing marketplace and to make financial services more 
widely available ``and cheaper than they've ever been.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American consumers spend an estimated $300 billion a year on  
financial services. Backers of the overhaul legislation -- including 
the deep-pocketed securities and insurance industries, who have 
been pushing it for 20 years -- say it is needed to keep the U.S. 
financial industry competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	A bill squeaked through the House last May by a 214-213 vote but  
was mired in the Senate by Gramm and several other Republican 
opponents of the community lending laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the banking industry opposed the legislation until last  
fall, when associations representing banks and independent 
insurance agents agreed to suggested changes regulating the sale of 
insurance by banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration generally supports overhauling the  
financial services laws but threatened to veto the bill if it 
retained the form passed by the House. The White House contended 
that version would hurt the efficiency of nationally chartered 
banks and put small banks at a disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
	A range of groups representing consumers, the elderly, farmers,  
community groups and smaller banks have raised concerns about the 
legislation. Some groups, and consumer advocate Ralph Nader, have 
warned it would foster an unprecedented concentration of financial 
power that could cost consumers money.

<HEADLINE> Hacker Given 5 Months in Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A flamboyant computer hacker who claims he  
helped put superhacker Kevin Mitnick behind bars was sentenced to 
five months in federal prison for skipping out on his probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Justin Petersen was sentenced Tuesday by U.S. District Court  
Judge Stephen V. Wilson. He could have received up to two years in 
prison but sentencing guidelines recommended five to 11 months, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you commit another crime, you face up to seven, eight, 10  
years. That's the way it is my friend,'' the judge warned Petersen. 
``I suggest you become a little less charming and a little more 
hard-working.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Petersen, 38, was known for his computer skills as well as his  
love of Sunset Strip nightlife, despite losing his left leg below 
the knee in a motorcycle accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lincoln, Neb., native who called himself ``Agent Steal''  
pleaded guilty in 1993 to federal crimes committed in California 
and Texas, including credit card fraud that involved stealing data 
from a credit information firm. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his sentencing was delayed while he worked as a  
government informant as he flew to computer conferences at FBI 
expense to spy on other hackers, including Mitnick, the only hacker 
to make the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitnick awaits an April 20 federal wire fraud trial in Los  
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Petersen spent 41 months in prison before his release last year.  
But authorities said he violated terms of his supervised release, 
including staying away from computers while not at work, before 
leaving a Los Angeles-area halfway house in August.

<HEADLINE> Donovan, Fogler Say Feud Is Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Feud? What feud?  
</P>
<P>
	Both Florida's Billy Donovan and South Carolina's Eddie Fogler  
think their preseason skirmish about the Gators' recruiting ethics 
is history -- and they don't plan to revisit it when the teams meet 
Wednesday night at the Carolina Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	``The incident is forgotten,'' Fogler said this week.  
</P>
<P>
	``To me it's over and done with,'' Donovan said. ``It's beyond  
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two clashed at the Southeastern Conference's media days in  
November. Fogler questioned, without mentioning names, a 10-day 
trip to France put together by a financial manager for Florida 
freshman Mike Miller, two Gator recruits, a Mississippi State 
recruit and two prep stars who had not committed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new gig -- it's legal. Now, is it ethical? You be the  
judge,'' Fogler said then. 
</P>
<P>
	Donovan called Fogler gutless.  
</P>
<P>
	Both were reprimanded by SEC commissioner Roy Kramer last month.  
The league said it investigated and found no recruiting violations, 
but Fogler didn't sound repentant or chastised. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you read that (SEC reprimand), I'm wrong, Fogler's wrong,  
bad guy, hung those people out to dry,'' he said in mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
	Both men now say the sniping is over.  
</P>
<P>
	``For me to hold a grudge or anything like that would not be  
right,'' Donovan said. ``Certainly the things I said at SEC media 
day, looking back on it now, maybe I should have just kept my mouth 
shut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sports Illustrated designated South Carolina-Florida its matchup  
of the week, saying the sideline action could be better than on the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	In the magazine's November profile of Donovan, the Florida coach  
said he would handle his dealings with Fogler behind the scenes. 
Neither has spoken with the other since. 
</P>
<P>
	Donovan said he plans on shaking Fogler's hand. Fogler wouldn't  
talk about it. Last year, he refused to shake hands with LSU's John 
Brady, then refused to say why. 
</P>
<P>
	Fogler called Donovan a great coach whose players reflect his  
style. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do I regret anything? No,'' Fogler said. ``I regret the  
reaction of the media, perhaps. I don't regret what I said.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Donovan said he tends to respond immediately when attacked, but  
now the focus is on the season and on-court goals. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina and Florida are heading in different directions.  
The Gators (11-2, 2-1 SEC) can win three straight conference games 
for the first time in Donovan's three seasons. The Gamecocks (5-9, 
0-4), who were SEC champions just two years ago, have lost seven of 
their past eight games.

<HEADLINE> Niners Coach Signs 5-Year Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Forget the rumors that Steve Mariucci  
was on his way out as San Francisco 49ers coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci was signed Tuesday to a new five-year contract worth  
about $2 million per season, quashing speculation abut his future 
with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, which replaced the three years remaining on his  
orginal pact, binds him to the 49ers through 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a happy day,'' interim general manager John McVay  
said. He completed negotiations this week, 2 1/2 months after they 
were started by Larry Thrailkill, who resigned last Saturday as 
interim team president. 
</P>
<P>
	``The team and the ownership and the organization are delighted  
to have this done and to have the comfort of knowing that we're 
going to have Steve here for five years on a new contract,'' McVay 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci said he planned to meet Wednesday with former 49ers  
coach Bill Walsh to discuss Walsh's return to the organization. 
Walsh could be hired by Thursday or Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh, the Hall of Fame coach who led San Francisco to its first  
three Super Bowls, is expected to help in personnel evaluation and 
oversee the draft. The 49ers fired their director of player 
personnel, Vinny Cerrato, late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci, whose job security was the subject of constant  
speculation despite a winning record, said he was relieved the deal 
was finally done. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tried to bring this news to you earlier. Sorry it took so  
long,'' Mariucci said, smiling. ``We finally had the opportunity to 
spend the time to hammer out all the issues and discuss it with the 
necessary parties and come to an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't tell you how excited I am to get this over with and  
move on, and find a way to keep our team together and add to it if 
we can and keep the guys that are necessary to continue to be a 
strong contender each year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci, who succeeded George Seifert two years ago, led San  
Francisco to a 12-4 regular-season finish and an NFC wild-card 
victory over Green Bay before the 49ers were eliminated by Atlanta 
20-18 in a divisional playoff Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, he has gone 27-9, including an 18-1 mark at home but  
there were rumors during the season that 49ers ownership planned to 
oust him and bring back Mike Holmgren from Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Those rumors calmed down after the 49ers beat the Packers and  
Holmgren left Green Bay to become coach and general manager of the 
Seattle Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci denied that he considered leaving the 49ers at any  
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing to me how many rumors there were and I couldn't  
imagine where they were getting these ideas,'' he said. ``Geez, I 
heard I was mad and irate, and all those things. Sure, maybe we 
were all a little frustrated that it took so long to get it done. 
But those things happen in a negotiation. I'm satisfied and happy 
with it. The club is happy and satisfied with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci said the talks took longer than expected because he was  
busy running the team during the season and the 49ers front office 
has been in flux with co-owner Eddie DeBartolo still awaiting NFL 
clearance to resume control of the team from his sister, co-owner 
Denise Debartolo York. 
</P>
<P>
	The team also has yet to sign permanent replacements for Carmen  
Policy and Dwight Clark, who were the 49ers' top two executives 
before moving on to the Cleveland Browns expansion franchise.

<HEADLINE> Athletes Must Know When It's Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	For an athlete, the toughest thing to confront is the end of a  
career, the moment when it's time to walk away gracefully. 
</P>
<P>
	Some, like Sandy Koufax and Jim Brown, had no trouble deciding.  
Some, like Muhammad Ali and Sugar Ray Leonard, didn't quite figure 
it out in time to avoid embarrassment. And others, like Gordie 
Howe, had a different agenda to pursue. 
</P>
<P>
	If he retires, Michael Jordan would leave the NBA at the top of  
his game. After winning the regular-season and playoff MVP awards, 
capturing his third straight scoring title and leading the Chicago 
Bulls to a sixth championship, Jordan's statement is clear: There 
is nothing more to say or do. 
</P>
<P>
	That was how Brown felt in 1965. He was just 29, the NFL's MVP  
coming off a career-high 21-touchdown season, when he told the 
Cleveland Browns he was done. 
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely wanted to leave on top,'' Brown said Tuesday at  
an ESPN function honoring the century's greatest athletes. ``I 
basically did everything I wanted to my last three years. I also 
wanted to leave on top because I'd seen other athletes who waited 
around too long and there was sadness in that. I didn't want anyone 
to feel sorry for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Koufax did the same thing a year later.  
</P>
<P>
	He was the best pitcher in baseball, armed with his fifth  
straight ERA title and third Cy Young Award after winning 27 games. 
But he also was tired of the postgame ice baths for his arthritic 
left elbow and decided, at 30, he wouldn't be doing that anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	They were the exceptions. So was Reggie White, who quit a year  
ago but changed his mind and played one more season with the Green 
Bay Packers. He had 16 sacks and won the Defensive Player of the 
Year Award. Now he's gone again, this time for good. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although I'm in good shape, my body hurts sometimes,'' White  
said. ``The bad thing about getting old is that when you wake up, 
things start hurting and you don't know why. And that's what I've 
been experiencing this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Howe was hockey's career scoring leader when he quit in 1971 and  
was parked in an office by the Detroit Red Wings for two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I retired, my troubles started from the fact I had a bone  
removed from my wrist and we weren't a good hockey team,'' said 
Howe, also honored by ESPN. ``The fun had left me for a while. But 
it was still hard to give up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was because his sons, Mark and Marty, were about to  
graduate from junior hockey to the pros. ``I wanted to play one 
more year because it was the thrill of my life playing with Mark 
and Marty,'' Howe said. 
</P>
<P>
	So, Howe came back for seven more seasons and tacked on 189 more  
goals, finishing his career with 975 -- 801 in the NHL, the 
remainder in the WHA. 
</P>
<P>
	And what about going out on top?  
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to enjoy it for as long as I could,'' Howe said.  
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes the fire that burns in a great athlete is difficult to  
extinguish. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest problem with terminating a career is usually when  
a player is cut from the team or suffers a career-ending injury,'' 
said Daniel Landers of Arizona State, past president of the 
American Psychological Association's sports psychology division. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Michael Jordan's case, he's voluntarily decided. He's  
financially secure. He could play longer and do well. We'd like to 
have more athletes like him instead of athletes who are forced out. 
His decision to end it is a healthy thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What about the others, the ones who hang on too long?  
</P>
<P>
	Ali, probably the most popular athlete of his era, toyed with  
retirement a number of times, starting as early as 1970 when he was 
28. He changed his mind later that year and fought through 1979. By 
then, he was 37 and the first man to win the heavyweight 
championship three times. 
</P>
<P>
	It was time to go. Instead, Ali stayed.  
</P>
<P>
	There was a 16-month layoff, ended by a one-sided 11-round loss  
to ex-sparring partner Larry Holmes. Then he fought again a year 
later, another loss at age 39, this time to journeyman Trevor 
Berbick in a bout that was held in the Bahamas because no U.S. 
commission would license it. 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard did the same thing. After his retina was detached in  
1982 he stayed away for two years, then looked bad in a comeback 
fight, and sat out three more years. He fought again from 1987-91 
and then after six years out of the ring, insisted on one more 
fight, losing to Hector Camacho in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``Leonard wasn't ready to quit because the doctors told him  
to,'' Landers said. ``There is a feeling of invulnerability, the 
feeling that `I'm special, I'm unique, I'm a superstar.' It's 
typical of high-level athletes. The quality that makes them great, 
sometimes prevents them from accepting the end. It's one thing to 
retire at 65. It's tough to do it at 35.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan is 35. He'll be 36 on Feb. 17.  
</P>
<P>
	If he does retire, no one has any idea if he'll stay retired.  
</P>
<P>
	He couldn't the last time.  
</P>
<P>
	Noting that, former rival Larry Bird offered this:  
</P>
<P>
	``There comes a time in every player's career that they have to  
make that decision, and he feels it's his time. We want to wish he 
and his family well, and we look forward to seeing him sometine in 
late March when he makes his return again in Market Square Arena.''

                        *William Bentley Ball    	
</P>
<P>
	HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- William Bentley Ball, an attorney who was  
a nationally known champion for religious freedom, died Sunday. He 
was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	He argued nine civil rights-related cases before the U.S.  
Supreme Court and assisted in more than two dozen cases before the 
high court. He was best known, however, for his work to preserve 
the Amish way of life. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1970s, Ball won a major battle for the Amish when  
he argued successfully before the high court in Wisconsin vs. 
Yoder. In the case, state officials tried to force Amish children 
to attend public school until age 16. 
</P>
<P>
	The case set a standard under which the government was required  
to show a compelling public need behind policies affecting 
religious groups. It was weakened however, in the early 1990s, and 
a bill in Congress to revive the protection, called the Religious 
Freedom Act, was muted by a Supreme Court decision. 
</P>
<P>
	He was also a teaching fellow in Notre Dame's German department;  
an attorney with W. R. Grace and Co. in New York and with the drug 
firm Pfizer Inc. He also taught law at Villanova University and was 
the general counsel for the Pennsylvania Catholic Conference.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Leo Cherne, who helped the United States  
mobilize for World War II and spent 40 years working on behalf of 
political refugees, died Tuesday of pneumonia. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	In the late 1930s, at the Roosevelt administration's request,  
Cherne helped create a plan to mobilize American industry for war, 
said the International Rescue Committee. In 1946, he helped Gen. 
Douglas MacArthur decide how to aid Japan's recovery from World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
	He served as a member of the President's Foreign Intelligence  
Advisory Board from 1973 to 1991, and was its chairman under 
President Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	Cherne helped found the Research Institute of America in 1936,  
and spent 50 years, most of his career, as its director. The group 
published papers and newsletters designed to keep businesspeople 
informed about economic affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	He served from 1951 to 1991 as chairman of the board at the  
rescue committee, a private group that works to aid refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	President Reagan gave him the Medal of Freedom in 1984, and the  
United Nations gave him the Gold Medal of Peace. He was inducted 
into the French Legion of Honor, and received the Commander's Cross 
from the government of the former West Germany.

<P>
	MILAN, Italy (AP) -- Fabrizio De Andre, a politically minded  
singer and songwriter popular in Italy since the 1960s, died Sunday 
at Milan's Tumor Institute. He was 59 and reportedly had been 
receiving treatments at the cancer hospital since summer. 
</P>
<P>
	De Andre found inspiration for his ballads both in French poetry  
and in politics. He sang about love, war and social issues, 
including the plight of workers. He also received critical acclaim 
for recordings made in his Genoese dialect.

<P>
	ATHENS, Ga. (AP) -- Margaret M. Dickie, an expert on modern  
American poetry and one of the first women to hold an endowed 
professorship at the University of Georgia, died Monday of lung 
cancer. She was 63. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Dickie was scheduled to receive the first Women's Studies  
Faculty Award from the university's Women's Studies Program the day 
she died. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Dickie joined the Georgia faculty in 1987 after leaving her  
position as chair of the English department at the University of 
Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	She was the author of six books, edited a collection of critical  
essays and contributed chapters in seven other works.

University of Rhode Island from 1958 to 1967, died Monday at age 
90. 
</P>
<P>
	After leaving URI in 1967, Horn held top administrative  
positions at a number of colleges. He was president of Albertus 
Magnus College in New Haven, Conn., executive vice president of

	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Manfred Karnovsky, a biochemist who did  
research and taught at Harvard University, died Thursday. He was 
80. 
</P>
<P>
	Karnovsky, who published his last scholarly paper last year,  
made landmark discoveries in the way white blood cells fight 
bacteria, and in molecular factors that contribute to sleep.

	WALTHAM, Mass. (AP) -- Freyda Koplow, Massachusetts' first female  
banking commissioner and the first woman to head a major department 
in the state government's executive branch, died Sunday. She was 
91. 
</P>
<P>
	She was appointed state banking commissioner in 1967 by Gov.  
John A. Volpe, and reappointed in 1970 by Gov. Francis W. Sargent. 
She served in the post until 1975.

<P>
	Mrs. Koplow had served in the Legislature as a Republican  
representative from Brookline from 1955 to 1967. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
	CARRADALE, Scotland (AP) -- Lady Naomi Mitchison, who was often  
called the doyenne of Scottish literature, died Monday at 101. 
</P>
<P>
	A poet and novelist, Lady Mitchison was a prolific writer --  
completing more than 80 novels. She never confined herself to one 
style, writing historical novels, science fiction, travel writing 
and a three volume autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
	Her first novel, ``The Conquered,'' was published in 1923 and  
was based on her wartime experiences. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1935, Lady Mitchison published her most controversial work.  
``We Have Been Wanted'' explored sexual behavior, including rape, 
seduction and abortion. The book was rejected by leading publishers 
and ultimately censored.

	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Doug Wickenheiser, a hockey player who played  
10 seasons in the National Hockey League and scored a dramatic 
overtime goal for the St. Louis Blues in the 1986 playoffs, died 
Tuesday of lung cancer. He was 37. 
</P>
<P>
	Wickenheiser, who played for St. Louis from 1983 to 1987,  
completed the Blues' rally from a 5-2 deficit to beat the Calgary 
Flames 6-5 in Game 6 of the Campbell Conference finals on May 12, 
1986. The Blues trailed by three goals with 11:52 to go but scored 
three goals to force overtime, and Wickenheiser got the game-winner 
at 7:30 of the extra period. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory forced Game 7, which Calgary won 2-1 two nights  
later to advance to the Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Wickenheiser totaled 111 goals and 156 assists in 556 games in  
career that also had stops at Montreal, Vancouver, the New York 
Rangers and Washington from 1980-90.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Up at Midday / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar edged higher against the yen Wednesday  
morning following currency intervention by the Bank of Japan the 
previous day. Japanese stocks rebounded moderately. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 112.54 yen in late morning, up 0.04 yen from  
late Tuesday in Tokyo and also above its level of 112.43 yen in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average rose 80.63 points, or 0.60 percent, to  
13,441.60 points at the end of the morning session. On Tuesday, the 
index lost 7.51 points, or 0.06 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the dollar steadied against the Japanese currency  
following remarks by a senior Japanese Finance Ministry official 
interpreted by traders as being dollar-supportive. 
</P>
<P>
	Koji Tanami, the vice finance minister, told reporters Wednesday  
morning that sharp foreign exchange movements were ``highly 
undesirable.'' Tanami refused to comment on Tuesday's yen-selling 
intervention by Japan's central bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``As players in the game, authorities don't comment on that,''  
Tanami said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanami's remarks spurred a bout of dollar-buying, helping to  
lift the U.S. currency off its intraday low of 112.22 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	But traders have been on guard against the possibility the Bank  
of Japan may intervene again to support the U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday it intervened to sell yen for the first time since  
February 1996, following growing anxiety over the yen's recent 
rally. Traders said the central bank spent $1 billion to $2 billion 
in foreign exchange markets as it dumped yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar, after sliding from a high of more than 147 yen in  
August to a 28-month low on Monday, rose more than 4 yen on the 
back of the surprise intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	A stronger yen tends to make Japanese exports more expensive  
abroad and cuts into profits earned overseas. Lower earnings by 
exporters could hamper efforts to jump-start Japan's 
recession-plagued economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at 130.12 yen in midday trading, up from  
127.83 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices slipped earlier in the  
session after a drop earlier on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones 
industrial average finished at 9,474.68, down 145.21 points. 
</P>
<P>
	But stocks moved into positive territory toward the morning  
close as stability on the foreign exchange market encouraged some 
investors, traders said. Many, however, remained cautious about 
currency movements. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 3.59 points, or 0.34 percent, to 1,059.49. The 
TOPIX lost 1.41 points, or 0.13 percent, the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yield on 10-year Japanese government bond fell to  
1.730 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.770 percent, driving its 
price up to 100.56 yen from 100.24 yen.

<HEADLINE>  Jordan Expected To Quit NBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Michael Jordan's teammates want to hear  
it from him. 
</P>
<P>
	They'll believe he is retiring from the Chicago Bulls and  
basketball only after he arrives at the United Center on Wednesday 
-- impeccably dressed, no doubt -- faces a mob of reporters and tells 
the world: 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm outta here.''  
</P>
<P>
	The greatest player in NBA history is expected to do precisely  
that at noon EST, according to a source with close ties to the 
league. If so, it would be his second retirement in five years, 
perhaps for good this time. 
</P>
<P>
	Until then, it was pretty much business as usual at Berto  
Center, except for the caravan of TV trucks and the media army that 
swarmed the place. With the lockout over and the season start-up 
less than a month away, several of Jordan's teammates showed up to 
work out, choose up sides and scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
	Some, like Steve Kerr, wouldn't say good-bye until Jordan did.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to get into my soliloquy about Michael Jordan  
until I hear it's official,'' said Kerr, who stayed long after most 
had left to work on his jump shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to hear it from the man himself,'' center Luc Longley  
said. ``Until I hear from M.J. -- and I haven't -- I'll wait and 
see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not Derrick Watt. The 32-year-old Bulls fan was quick to say  
what he thought Jordan's expected departure would mean for the city 
and team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Losers! Losers! Losers!'' he said as he left Jordan's downtown  
restaurant. ``Without Michael, they'll be in the basement of their 
division.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe. But one thing's for sure: The team will never be the same  
without Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	B.J. Armstrong, now with Charlotte but who played on three Bulls  
title teams, had mixed emotions about the retirement reports. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a way to go out as an athlete and that's the way to go  
out,'' said Armstrong, a good friend of Jordan's. 
</P>
<P>
	``He went out on top, he made the last shot, he made all the  
right plays. He's had a fabulous career and everything you could 
ever ask as an athlete he's done. He had a chance to leave and this 
was the chance. '' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Tribune quoted a source as saying Jordan met with a  
few teammates at his home Monday, including Ron Harper and Scottie 
Pippen, and told them the thought of playing an abbreviated, 
50-game season wasn't enough of a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	If that's the case and he retires, Jordan's fans' last image of  
their hero at his best will undoubtedly be his sensational, 
last-second shot that won Game 6 in Utah. That thriller gave the 
Bulls their sixth championship of the 90's. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decision is that you're walking away from something where  
you're the best, not like he's one of the best, he's the best,'' 
Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's doing it his way. There's a part of me that is sad but a  
part of me that is happy to see him go out on top.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He would also be going out as a five-time league MVP, 10-time  
league scoring championship -- and one month (Feb. 17) shy of his 
36th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Jerry Krause, who openly feuded with Jordan, had  
no comment as he pulled his car into the snowy parking lot at the 
practice center. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach-in-waiting Tim Floyd wasn't saying much, either. He rolled  
his car window down and said: ``I don't think it would be 
appropriate for me to say anything at this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In case everyone has forgotten, for a long time Jordan loudly  
proclaimed he had no intention of playing for any coach but Phil 
Jackson, who left the team after June's championship and has 
declined several invitations to return. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's Dream Team teammate and TV commercial sidekick Larry  
Bird, who retired and then returned as coach of the Indiana Pacers, 
jokingly suggested the NBA hadn't seen the last of His Airness: 
</P>
<P>
	``There comes a time in every player's career that they have to  
make that decision and he feels it's his time. We want to wish he 
and his family well and we look forward to seeing him sometime in 
late March when he makes his return again in Market Square Arena.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's where Jordan made his comeback nearly four years ago.  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan retired from the Bulls the first time in October 1993,  
saying he had accomplished everything he wanted to in basketball 
and planned to devote more time to his family. Instead, he spent 
1994 playing minor league baseball for the Double-A Birmingham 
Barons, a farm team of the Chicago White Sox. He left baseball in 
the spring of 1995 and returned to the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	John Bach, an assistant coach on three of the Bulls'  
championship teams, praised Jordan for not only his skill, but for 
the joy he brought to the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He never looked like he'd been sentenced by a judge to play  
basketball,'' Bach said. ``I've seen too many athletes not go out 
at the right time. They stay and struggle and lose some of the 
dignity they are entitled to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appalachian State coach Buzz Peterson called his former North  
Carolina roommate and put the question to him directly. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's going on? I've got 25 pink slip phone messages here in  
front of me,'' Peterson said. ``He just laughed and said 
everything's coming out now and everything's being said.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like the close friend that he is, Peterson declined to say what  
Jordan would announce on Wednesday. But he added: 
</P>
<P>
	``He's just run out of things to prove and he loves those kids.  
Whenever I talk to him, he just can't stop talking about Marcus and 
Jeffrey and Jasmine,'' Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Marcus and Jeffrey are playing basketball now and he could  
tell you how many points they scored and how many assists they had 
and what the final score was of every one of their games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson recalled how Jordan once predicted just how famous he  
would become. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he won the Naismith and the Wooden Award in 1984 he came  
back and said to me, `They're going to name a shoe after me.' And I 
said, `Now, come on, Michael. They make shoes for Larry Bird and 
Magic Johnson. What makes you think they're going to name a shoe 
after you?' 
</P>
<P>
	``And he said, `I'm telling you. It's time to buy some stock in  
Nike.'''

<HEADLINE> NCAA To Allow 12 Football Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Preseason games such as the Kickoff Classic  
and Pigskin Classic will be out of business by 2002, according to a 
decision Tuesday by the NCAA Division I board of directors allowing 
a 12th major-college football game. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the board decided to allow Division I schools to play 28  
basketball games, one more than the current limit, but removed the 
exemption for preseason tournaments such as the Maui Invitational 
and Great Alaska Shootout. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12th football game would be allowed only in those years in  
which there are 14 Saturdays in the season, which occurs six times 
over a 20-year period. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was very little discussion,'' David Berst, the NCAA's  
chief of staff for Division I governance. ``It eliminates preseason 
events.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal's passage effectively eliminates the Pigskin,  
Kickoff, Eddie Robinson and the Black Coaches Association games. 
The Football Issues Committee said earlier it was in the best 
interests of college football to eliminate the preseason events. 
</P>
<P>
	Basketball tournaments such as the Maui, Great Alaska, Puerto  
Rico Shootout and preseason NIT wouldn't be out of business, but 
would face difficulty getting teams, since those games would now 
count against a team's limit of 28 a season. And schools would be 
limited to two preseason tournament appearances every four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was possible they were concerned they were being  
too restrictive,'' Berst said of the board's decision. ``They saw 
it as still spreading out competition but they were concerned it 
could be an overemphasis.''

<HEADLINE>  Jordan Expected To Quit NBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Michael Jordan's teammates want to hear  
it from him. 
</P>
<P>
	They'll believe he is retiring from the Chicago Bulls and  
basketball only after he arrives at the United Center on Wednesday 
-- impeccably dressed, no doubt -- faces a mob of reporters and tells 
the world: 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm outta here.''  
</P>
<P>
	The greatest player in NBA history is expected to do precisely  
that at noon EST, according to a source with close ties to the 
league. If so, it would be his second retirement in five years, 
perhaps for good this time. 
</P>
<P>
	Until then, it was pretty much business as usual at Berto  
Center, except for the caravan of TV trucks and the media army that 
swarmed the place. With the lockout over and the season start-up 
less than a month away, several of Jordan's teammates showed up to 
work out, choose up sides and scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
	Some, like Steve Kerr, wouldn't say good-bye until Jordan did.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to get into my soliloquy about Michael Jordan  
until I hear it's official,'' said Kerr, who stayed long after most 
had left to work on his jump shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to hear it from the man himself,'' center Luc Longley  
said. ``Until I hear from M.J. -- and I haven't -- I'll wait and 
see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not Derrick Watt. The 32-year-old Bulls fan was quick to say  
what he thought Jordan's expected departure would mean for the city 
and team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Losers! Losers! Losers!'' he said as he left Jordan's downtown  
restaurant. ``Without Michael, they'll be in the basement of their 
division.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe. But one thing's for sure: The team will never be the same  
without Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	B.J. Armstrong, now with Charlotte but who played on three Bulls  
title teams, had mixed emotions about the retirement reports. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a way to go out as an athlete and that's the way to go  
out,'' said Armstrong, a good friend of Jordan's. 
</P>
<P>
	``He went out on top, he made the last shot, he made all the  
right plays. He's had a fabulous career and everything you could 
ever ask as an athlete he's done. He had a chance to leave and this 
was the chance. '' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Tribune quoted a source as saying Jordan met with a  
few teammates at his home Monday, including Ron Harper and Scottie 
Pippen, and told them the thought of playing an abbreviated, 
50-game season wasn't enough of a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	If that's the case and he retires, Jordan's fans' last image of  
their hero at his best will undoubtedly be his sensational, 
last-second shot that won Game 6 in Utah. That thriller gave the 
Bulls their sixth championship of the 90's. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decision is that you're walking away from something where  
you're the best, not like he's one of the best, he's the best,'' 
Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's doing it his way. There's a part of me that is sad but a  
part of me that is happy to see him go out on top.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He would also be going out as a five-time league MVP, 10-time  
league scoring championship -- and one month (Feb. 17) shy of his 
36th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Jerry Krause, who openly feuded with Jordan, had  
no comment as he pulled his car into the snowy parking lot at the 
practice center. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach-in-waiting Tim Floyd wasn't saying much, either. He rolled  
his car window down and said: ``I don't think it would be 
appropriate for me to say anything at this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In case everyone has forgotten, for a long time Jordan loudly  
proclaimed he had no intention of playing for any coach but Phil 
Jackson, who left the team after June's championship and has 
declined several invitations to return. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's Dream Team teammate and TV commercial sidekick Larry  
Bird, who retired and then returned as coach of the Indiana Pacers, 
jokingly suggested the NBA hadn't seen the last of His Airness: 
</P>
<P>
	``There comes a time in every player's career that they have to  
make that decision and he feels it's his time. We want to wish he 
and his family well and we look forward to seeing him sometime in 
late March when he makes his return again in Market Square Arena.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's where Jordan made his comeback nearly four years ago.  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan retired from the Bulls the first time in October 1993,  
saying he had accomplished everything he wanted to in basketball 
and planned to devote more time to his family. Instead, he spent 
1994 playing minor league baseball for the Double-A Birmingham 
Barons, a farm team of the Chicago White Sox. He left baseball in 
the spring of 1995 and returned to the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	John Bach, an assistant coach on three of the Bulls'  
championship teams, praised Jordan for not only his skill, but for 
the joy he brought to the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He never looked like he'd been sentenced by a judge to play  
basketball,'' Bach said. ``I've seen too many athletes not go out 
at the right time. They stay and struggle and lose some of the 
dignity they are entitled to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appalachian State coach Buzz Peterson called his former North  
Carolina roommate and put the question to him directly. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's going on? I've got 25 pink slip phone messages here in  
front of me,'' Peterson said. ``He just laughed and said 
everything's coming out now and everything's being said.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like the close friend that he is, Peterson declined to say what  
Jordan would announce on Wednesday. But he added: 
</P>
<P>
	``He's just run out of things to prove and he loves those kids.  
Whenever I talk to him, he just can't stop talking about Marcus and 
Jeffrey and Jasmine,'' Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Marcus and Jeffrey are playing basketball now and he could  
tell you how many points they scored and how many assists they had 
and what the final score was of every one of their games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson recalled how Jordan once predicted just how famous he  
would become. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he won the Naismith and the Wooden Award in 1984 he came  
back and said to me, `They're going to name a shoe after me.' And I 
said, `Now, come on, Michael. They make shoes for Larry Bird and 
Magic Johnson. What makes you think they're going to name a shoe 
after you?' 
</P>
<P>
	``And he said, `I'm telling you. It's time to buy some stock in  
Nike.'''

<HEADLINE> Rep. Kasich May Run for White House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. John Kasich, the boyish-looking House  
Budget Committee chairman from Ohio, will take the first step this 
week toward seeking the Republican presidential nomination, The 
Associated Press has learned. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich, 46, a ninth-term House member, will form an exploratory  
committee with the Federal Election Commission on Wednesday, 
allowing him to raise and spend money while he tests the waters, an 
official involved with the effort said Tuesday. He will announce 
this step Feb. 15 in Ohio, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich confidants say the lawmaker is almost certain to become a  
full-fledged candidate, but that announcement probably would come 
in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Another likely Republican candidate, former Vice President Dan  
Quayle, said Tuesday that national security should be a critical 
issue in the 2000 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``No presidential candidate should be taken seriously unless he  
or she understands the importance of foreign policy,'' Quayle told 
the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle, who plans to announce his intentions soon, refused  
Tuesday to critique potential rivals. But when asked about the 
foreign policy experience of a likely rival, Texas Gov. George W. 
Bush, Quayle said: ``Clearly experience helps. I don't need 
on-the-job training.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the Democratic side of the 2000 equation, former Sen. Bill  
Bradley of New Jersey formally became a presidential candidate 
Tuesday. Bradley, who formed an exploratory committee in December, 
quietly established the Bill Bradley for President Campaign with 
the FEC. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're encouraged by the campaign's first efforts in fund  
raising,'' Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser said. His boss will soon 
visit early primary states New Hampshire and Iowa for the first 
time since his decision to explore the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley plans to formally announce his challenge to Vice  
President Al Gore in the spring. Gore, who formed his campaign Jan. 
1, hopes to benefit from President Clinton's support. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, it's a two-man Democratic field.  
</P>
<P>
	Sens. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Paul Wellstone of Minnesota  
bypassed uphill challenges to Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt is tempted to remain in the  
House and help Democrats try to capture the chamber in 2000, but he 
has not made a final decision. The Missouri Democrat, who would 
pose a severe threat to Gore, could announce his intentions as 
early as next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts and civil rights activist Jesse  
Jackson are determining whether to run. Kerry met with advisers in 
Boston on Tuesday to discuss a possible candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's staff is busy with the nuts and bolts of campaign  
organizing -- looking for office space and sifting through resumes. 
Their boss' busy travel schedule will take him to New Jersey, New 
York, Florida, Colorado, California and New Hampshire in the coming 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican presidential field will be more crowded.  
</P>
<P>
	Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, who failed to win the  
nomination in 1996, formed an exploratory committee Friday and 
plans to run again. Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Bob Smith of 
New Hampshire had already declared themselves candidates with the 
FEC. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other Republicans are almost certain to get into the  
race, including Quayle, millionaire Steve Forbes and conservative 
activist Gary Bauer. Bush is likely to run, but confidants caution 
that his candidacy is not certain. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading Republicans are streaming to Austin, Texas, to pay  
homage to the early favorite, asking him to help raise money in 
their states and promising their support if he runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Some supporters are telling potential donors in Washington that  
Bush may not accept federal matching money, which would free him of 
spending caps. However, Bush advisers say those decisions have not 
been made. 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech, Quayle said the Clinton administration  
``frittered away'' opportunities left by his boss, former President 
Bush. Clinton has stumbled with regard to policies in China, Cuba, 
Iraq, North Korea and Russia, Quayle said, adding he has also 
fumbled on issues like terrorism and strategic defense initiatives 
and in his duties to support troops and defense technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``Major issues are being ignored, standards are lowered,''  
Quayle said. ``There's a sinking feeling around the world that 
American has simply lost its will and credibility to lead.''

<HEADLINE> Steelers' Wolford Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Pittsburgh Steelers coach Bill Cowher talked  
offensive lineman Will Wolford out of retirement once. He couldn't 
do it twice. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolford, who nearly quit before the 1998 season, is retiring  
after 13 seasons, leaving the Steelers with a significant hole at 
left tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	Justin Strzelczyk, who missed most of the season with a knee  
injury, likely will move from right tackle to left tackle to 
replace Wolford. 
</P>
<P>
	By retiring, Wolford will bypass the final season of a contract  
worth $2.1 million in base salary. Because he has not retired 
officially, the Steelers listed him Tuesday as one of their five 
players available to the Cleveland Browns in next month's expansion 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolford played in three Super Bowls in seven seasons with the  
Buffalo Bills, then spent three seasons with the Indianapolis Colts 
before signing with the Steelers in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolford's final year in football was marked by two significant  
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	He injured his neck in a swimming pool accident last summer,  
causing him to temporarily consider retirement. Later, after moving 
from guard to tackle, he tore a chest muscle in the fourth game of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	He missed two of the next three games, then returned to start  
the final eight while wearing a protective harness that severely 
restricted his mobility.

<HEADLINE> Flynt Says He's Too Sick for Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Larry Flynt says he's too sick to go to trial  
on obscenity charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The 55-year-old Hustler publisher and his brother, Jimmy, 49,  
are accused of obscenity and other charges for selling sexually 
explicit videos at their Hustler Magazine &AMP; Gifts store. The trial 
is set for Jan. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Flynt's attorneys asked for a postponement of two months, saying  
he needs surgery to correct a urological problem common among 
paraplegics. Flynt has been in a wheelchair since he was shot in 
1978. 
</P>
<P>
	``The doctor is really worried about this,'' lawyer H. Louis  
Sirkin said. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge scheduled a hearing Wednesday on the request.  
</P>
<P>
	Flynt was charged after a 14-year-old boy said he bought a video  
at the store. If convicted, Flynt could get 24 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1977, Flynt was convicted of obscenity for selling Hustler in  
Cincinnati. The conviction was overturned on appeal.

<HEADLINE>  Denver Offense Makes Sweet Sounds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- No matter how many rounds of musical chairs the  
Denver Broncos play with their offensive line, they keep making 
sweet sounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Backup Matt Lepsis was forced into the lineup by an injury in  
Saturday's divisional playoff game against Miami, and the Broncos 
didn't miss a beat. 
</P>
<P>
	After left tackle Tony Jones limped to the sideline midway  
through the second quarter with a twisted knee, right tackle Harry 
Swayne switched to the left side and Lepsis settled into Swayne's 
old position. 
</P>
<P>
	To that point, Terrell Davis had run for 100 yards on 11  
carries. Afterward, he ran for 99 yards on 10 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	Such seamless substitution has become a trademark of this unit,  
which paved the way for Davis to rush for 1,750 yards in 1997 and 
then, after numerous changes in the preseason, helped orchestrate a 
2,008-yard season for the league's MVP this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought Harry did an exceptional job on the left side,''  
coach Mike Shanahan said. ``Matt did a good job. It wasn't perfect, 
but he really played hard and got the job done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Swayne hadn't worked at left tackle all season. ``It was  
weird,'' he said, ``since everything is backward. At first, I 
couldn't figure out what stance I wanted to get in. I didn't want 
to go the wrong way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teammates gave Lepsis high marks.  
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who is expected to return for Sunday's game, said he  
``didn't have to say anything to Matt -- except `good job.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback John Elway said Lepsis ``hasn't had a lot of playing  
time. But what he did was really special, and I told him that after 
the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lepsis, who played sparingly in four games this season, appeared  
more poised than in those tentative appearances. He was, however, 
still a bit excitable, accidentally decking teammate Derek Loville 
while attempting to offer congratulations after Loville's 11-yard 
touchdown run. Loville's score capped the drive on which Jones was 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really fired up,'' said Lepsis, a tight end at Colorado  
who has bulked up to 290 pounds. ``When I saw Tony go down, I knew 
I had to go in there and not let the team down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis' 199 yards and two touchdowns led the Broncos to a 38-3  
rout of the Dolphins, advancing the Broncos to Sunday's AFC 
championship game against the New York Jets at Mile High Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The offensive line was widely expected to be the Broncos'  
Achilles' heel as they sought to repeat as Super Bowl champions 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Pro Bowl left tackle Gary Zimmerman had retired, and veteran  
right guard Brian Habib signed a free-agent contract with Seattle. 
Habib's projected replacement, David Diaz-Infante, went down with a 
knee injury in the preseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones switched sides, becoming Zimmerman's replacement at the  
crucial left tackle position that protects Elway's blindside. 
Swayne, a backup in 1997, moved to right tackle, and second-year 
pro Dan Neil became the starting right guard. Only center Tom Nalen 
and left guard Mark Schlereth were in the same positions as in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Too many adjustments in a unit that demands cohesion? Most  
observers thought so. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos' offense, however, was even more prolific this year  
than in their Super Bowl season. Besides Davis' improved numbers, 
the offense as a whole gained 6,092 yards, compared to last year's 
5,872, and scored 501 points, compared to 472. Both figures were 
franchise records. The line also allowed only 25 sacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The line has been intact all season, with all five players  
starting every game, even though Schlereth underwent arthroscopic 
knee surgery on Oct. 12 -- the 21st surgery of his career. He had 
the operation prior to a bye week and was back in the starting 
lineup just 13 days after the surgery.

<P>
	``It's sad for everyone to see the greatest basketball player in

player's career that they have to make that decision, and he feels 
it's his time.'' -- Indiana Pacers coach Larry Bird. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

Babe Ruth and that's the truth. If we're waiting for one guy, we're 
going to be waiting for a long, long time.'' -- Turner Sports 
analyst and former player Doc Rivers. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

	``He dropped hints last season and last summer that this would  
probably be his last go-around. Ending on top was how he wants to 
do it and that's about the best way you can do it.'' -- Bulls free 
agent Dickey Simpkins.

                             	------

	``The NBA, the fans, the players, the coaches, American society  
and history are losing the greatest influence that sports has ever 
had. ... He has had the most influence of any living athlete in the 
history of any sport when it comes to the toy department of human 
affairs.'' -- Miami Heat coach Pat Riley.

<P>
                             	------

<HEADLINE> Ex-Texas Player Sues Radio Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Former Texas player Luke Axtell, who  
ignited a revolt that led to the ouster of basketball coach Tom 
Penders, is suing the radio station which broadcast a report about 
his academic status. 
</P>
<P>
	Axtell maintains his right to privacy was violated by KVET-AM,  
and that the station did not make sure the information it received 
was accurate. 
</P>
<P>
	The civil lawsuit filed Monday in Travis County holds that  
Axtell was defamed and subjected to public hatred, contempt and 
ridicule. Axtell, who has since transferred to Kansas, is seeking 
more than $50,000 in damages. 
</P>
<P>
	An attorney for the station's owner, Capstar Texas Limited  
Partnership, Keith Trent, would not comment today on the lawsuit, 
but said a response would be filed denying Axtell's allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Axtell's attorney did not immediately return phone calls.  
</P>
<P>
	Axtell, a 6-foot-9 guard, was suspended March 17, touching off a  
player revolt that led to Penders' departure. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, the player said would leave Texas because the coach  
verbally abused him. Then, Penders assistant Eddie Oran gave 
Axtell's grades to the radio station. 
</P>
<P>
	Axtell averaged 13.3 points and 4.3 rebounds last seasons and  
hit 39.3 percent of his 3-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Penders was replaced by Rick Barnes and now coaches at George  
Washington

<HEADLINE> Bradley To Run for President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Just a month after forming a presidential  
exploratory committee, former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley 
officially stepped into the race for the White House today by 
filing a statement of candidacy with the Federal Election 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bill Bradley Presidential Exploratory Committee thus becomes  
the Bill Bradley for President Campaign, and Bradley joins Vice 
President Al Gore in the race for the Democratic nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, it's a two-person field. Two other prospective  
candidates on the Democratic side, Sens. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and 
Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, have decided not to run. 
</P>
<P>
	House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., has not decided  
whether to run and may choose to remain in the House in hopes of 
becoming speaker should Democrats take back the majority in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	In forming his exploratory committee Dec. 4, Bradley left little  
doubt he would run. The former New York Knicks basketball star and 
three-term senator has already made fund-raising trips to 
California and elsewhere and has assembled a campaign staff. 
</P>
<P>
	A press release from his campaign said Bradley plans a formal  
public announcement of his candidacy by early spring. He had no 
public schedule today and was not immediately available for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, 55, has carried the presidential aspirations of his  
supporters since his college days as a star basketball player and 
student at Princeton University. Supporters hoped he would run in 
1988 and again in 1992, but Bradley demurred.

<HEADLINE> Intel Profits Up 18 Pct. in Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Intel Corp.'s fourth-quarter profits rose 18  
percent to easily beat Wall Street expectations, helped by strong 
demand for its pricier microprocessors used in powerful personal 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Intel cautioned Tuesday that revenue in the current  
quarter should drop from fourth-quarter levels due to a seasonal 
slump in sales of personal computers that typically follows the 
holiday buying season. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the results suggested a mixed outlook for the  
computer industry, which looks to the largest maker of computer 
chips as a broader barometer of high-tech demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel earned $2.06 billion, or $1.19 a share on a diluted basis,  
in the three months ended Dec. 26, 1998. That was up from a profit 
of $1.74 billion, or 98 cents a diluted share, in the year-ago 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose 17 percent to a record $7.61 billion from $6.51  
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Intel profit handily surpassed Wall Street forecasts for a  
profit of $1.07 a share. The results were released at the close of 
financial markets, after Intel stock fell Tuesday by $4.18 3/4 a share 
to $135.56 1/4 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., cited cost-cutting and  
strong sales of its chips, particularly its more profitable Xeon 
microprocessors used as the brains in desktop machines bought by 
businesses. A shift in Intel's sales mix toward the expensive 
processors more than offset damage to Intel's bottom line by sharp 
price cuts in chips used in inexpensive PCs costing $1,000 and 
less, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel said its improved profitability should continue this year,  
with gross margins -- what it makes after subtracting certain 
expenses -- continuing to beat levels set earlier last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the good news,'' said Andrew Peck, an analyst with  
Cowen &AMP; Co., a Boston-based investment bank. ``The only source of 
disappointment is the company is clearly girding for a typical 
season decline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, Intel earned $6.07 billion, or $3.45 a diluted  
share, up from a profit of $6.95 billion, or $3.87 a diluted share. 
Revenues rose to $26.27 billion from $25.07 billion.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Lower; Dow Down 75 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks slumped at midday, dragged down by  
profit-taking as investors cashed in on the market's recent 
record-breaking rise. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest losses came in the Nasdaq composite, which turned  
lower after a seven-day winning streak due to a sharp decline in 
technology and Internet stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 75.17 at 9,544.72. Broader stock indicators also were lower 
this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet and technology stocks have been the big winners on Wall  
Street this year, and those gains have pushed the Nasdaq up more 
than 8 percent since the start of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	But investors today decided to take profits on many of those  
stocks that have been flying high in 1999. That sent the Nasdaq 
down 38.88 to 2,345.71. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the biggest losers were Amazon.com, which fell 17 to 167 5/8,  
Lycos, which was down 19 9/32 at 111 23/32. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! and Intel also sank ahead of their fourth-quarter  
earnings reports due out later today. Investors believe both 
companies will report strong profits, but some now worry that their 
earnings expectations may have risen too high. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! was down 14 3/8 at 401 and Intel was off 2 7/8 at 136 7/8.  
</P>
<P>
	Blue-chip shares also fell to profit taking. The Dow gained 5  
percent last week, the first trading week of the new year. It was 
down 23.43 on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow component Alcoa was down 3 1/16 at 85 1/8 after its stock was  
downgraded by Morgan Stanley. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 340.68 million 
shares, down from 356.50 million shares on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 13.54 at 1,250.34, the  
NYSE composite index was down 4.81 at 599.23, and the American 
Stock Exchange composite index was down 5.69 at 701.63. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average was down 0.06 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 0.08, Britain's 
FT-SE 100 was down 0.02 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 1 
percent.

<HEADLINE> Judge Asks About Microsoft Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The judge who will decide the Microsoft  
antitrust case pointedly asked a government witness Tuesday whether 
the company is following a strategy of ``delayed gratification'' by 
keeping its software prices low. 
</P>
<P>
	As the government prepared to end its case after 10 weeks at  
trial, the unexpected question posed by U.S. District Judge Thomas 
Penfield Jackson appeared to undermine a key Microsoft defense: If 
the company wields such power in the high-tech industry, why 
doesn't it raise prices more? 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's first witness, economist Richard Schmalensee, who is  
expected to take the stand Wednesday, told the judge in written 
testimony that if the company wielded monopoly power, it would 
charge computer makers ``at least 16 times'' more for its Windows 
operating system than its current prices, which are a closely 
guarded secret, but believed to be $45 to $65. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside court, Stephen Houck, the lead lawyer for the 19 states  
suing Microsoft with the Justice Department, called Schmalensee 
``one of the only economists -- one of the few people in the country 
-- who refuses to acknowledge that Microsoft has a monopoly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft wants to convince the judge that it doesn't possess  
monopoly power because many of the government's claims of 
predatory, anti-competitive behavior hinge on that definition. 
</P>
<P>
	But the judge asked the final government witness Tuesday whether  
Microsoft might be strategically setting prices for Windows lower 
than it might otherwise with its eye on future profits. He called 
it ``a concept of delayed gratification.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``As more and more people become interested in using PCs, they  
will buy PCs so long as the overall cost is something they can 
afford. Otherwise, they'll buy a larger television set,'' Jackson 
said, asking whether Microsoft might be looking to long-term 
profits ``by keeping its contribution to the cost of a PC low.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's entirely possible, your honor,'' answered economist  
Franklin Fisher, who was expected to finish testifying Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges that Microsoft illegally bundled its  
Internet browser software free into newer versions of Windows to 
``crush'' rival Netscape, whose own popular browser is a direct 
competitor and earned tens of millions of dollars when it dominated 
the browser market. 
</P>
<P>
	Government lawyers say Microsoft was motivated by the fear that  
Internet software eventually might assume many roles that Windows 
now performs as a computer's central nervous system. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher asserted that Microsoft's ability to raise prices ``might  
be exercised later. To assume a monopolist with power will not 
always exercise the power is to rely on the benevolence of the 
monopolist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft was expected to question Fisher again briefly  
Wednesday, marking the end of the government case and the start of 
Microsoft calling witnesses. The trial is expected to last until 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	In a rare appearance at the courthouse, U.S. Assistant Attorney  
General Joel I. Klein lauded government lawyers for showing a 
``pattern of anti-competitive practices'' that resulted in 
``restricted consumer choice, stifled innovation, and led to higher 
prices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to e-mails introduced during the trial, Klein also  
cited ``an extraordinary mountain of evidence that this company did 
not compete on the merits.''

<HEADLINE> McGwire's 70th Sells for $3 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Philip Ozersky ignored an offer to shake hands  
with Mark McGwire and take home some autographed paraphernalia in 
exchange for home run No. 70. 
</P>
<P>
	Smart move.  
</P>
<P>
	Then he turned down a $1 million offer for the baseball.  
</P>
<P>
	An even smarter move.  
</P>
<P>
	That's because the ball wound up being sold to an anonymous  
phone bidder for a record $3 million at Guernsey's Auction House. 
</P>
<P>
	The price included a bid of $2.7 million, plus a $305,000  
buyer's commission, making the total sale price $3,005,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Ozersky, a research scientist at Washington University in St.  
Louis, was flabbergasted by the price. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited and overwhelmed,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ozersky, who retrieved McGwire's No. 70 when it landed under his  
seat in a private box at Busch Stadium last Sept. 27, said he never 
imagined that would happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was the person who least expected a ball to fly in there,''  
he said. ``I never caught a baseball before. I went to see the 
Cards play and have some fun with friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he put the ball up for auction, Ozersky admitted he didn't  
know what to expect. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sky's the limit,'' he said. ``and I found out what the sky  
was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So did Irwin Sternberg, president of Stonehenge, Ltd.,  
manufacturers of fine neckwear. When auctioneer JoAnne Carter 
reached $1.6 million, the bidding turned into a one-on-one showdown 
between Sternberg and the anonymous voice on the telephone, who 
described himself only as ``one heck of a baseball fan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With bids jumping $100,000 at a time, Sternberg stayed in until  
$2.6 and then blinked. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little sorry I didn't go higher,'' he said later. ``I  
think the person on the line didn't have a bottom line. If it went 
to $3 million, it would be $3.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I congratulate the owner, whoever that is. I hope whoever  
purchased it uses it well. It would be a loss to the country if it 
is locked away in a vault.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sternberg did not leave the auction empty-handed. He purchased a  
ball signed by Babe Ruth and Roger Maris, previous holders of the 
home run record, for $60,000 and said he would use it to raise 
funds for the Jimmy V. Foundation for cancer research, named for 
deceased college basketball coach Jim Valvano. 
</P>
<P>
	The McGwire ball was the centerpiece of the auction, and it took  
just 12 minutes for the sale to be completed. Other lots went for 
considerably less, including Sammy Sosa's 66th home run, which went 
for $150,000, plus a $22,500 buyer's commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Hank Aaron's 755th career home run reached $800,000, but was  
withdrawn because that was below the minimum price set by 
Guernsey's. Also withdrawn was Mickey Mantle's 500th home run ball 
when questions of its authenticity came up. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Arlan Ettinger, president of Guernsey's, was thrilled  
with the results of the auction, which drew about 500 bidders to 
Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	``Three million is an extraordinary accomplishment,'' he said.  
``It's 23 times the world record for any baseball ever sold, and 
five to six times the record of any sports artifact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The previous record price for a baseball was the $126,500 paid  
two months ago for the ball Babe Ruth hit for the first home run at 
Yankee Stadium. The McGwire bidding began at $400,000 and just kept 
going up from there. 
</P>
<P>
	When the final price was reached, the crowd cheered and Ettinger  
exulted, ``As Mel Allen would say,'' he said, ``How about that?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ozersky, the research scientist who went to a ball game and  
became a millionaire, was thinking the same thing.

	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Environmentalists are hoping to sink  
Leonardo DiCaprio's latest film shoot. 
</P>
<P>
	Activists, local residents and hotel and tour operators have  
lined up against 20th Century Fox's plans to film ``The Beach'' on 
Phi Phi Island, 340 miles from Bangkok. They fear filming will harm 
Maya Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents say the film crew has removed the natural vegetation  
from the beach and planted 93 coconut trees. Activists have said 
that will cause erosion. 
</P>
<P>
	They were in court Tuesday seeking an emergency injunction to  
halt the production but were turned down. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have done our best for today, but it has to go according to

<HEADLINE> Boy Murder Witness Slain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- When Leroy Brown Jr. became a key  
witness in a murder case at age 7, his mother was asked if she 
wanted police to guard their home. Karen Clarke declined. 
</P>
<P>
	Still fearing for her safety, authorities asked whether Ms.  
Clarke, 30, and her son needed help in relocating. 
</P>
<P>
	Again, Ms. Clarke said no, intent on staying put.  
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, another question was being asked: Why wasn't more  
done to protect mother and son, both of whom were found gunned down 
inside their unguarded home? 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a failure of the entire system -- the system broke  
down -- and as a result of that we have a dead child and a dead 
mother,'' said Chris Caruso, a state lawmaker from Bridgeport. 
</P>
<P>
	Leroy, who was 8, was shot in the head and back and the mother  
was shot twice in the back. Police believe the killings happened 
Thursday as the pair were returning home from an errand. 
</P>
<P>
	Although police released no details on a motive or suspect, they  
were seeking to question Russell Peeler, 26, who is charged with 
murder in the May 29 death of Ms. Clarke's fiance, Rudolph Snead 
Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of Snead's murder, Peeler was free on bond after  
being accused of attempting to murder Snead months earlier in a 
drive-by shooting. He is free now on $900,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy had been in the backseat of Snead's car during the  
original shooting and identified Peeler as the triggerman, 
prosecutor Jonathan Benedict said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Peeler's attorney, Gary Mastronardi, did not return telephone  
calls Monday. He has said that Peeler wears an electronic 
monitoring device and was at his home when Leroy and his mother 
were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Mastronardi said neither he nor his client knew where the boy  
and his mother were living. 
</P>
<P>
	Following Snead's death, police said the family had briefly  
received protection in July. But it was canceled at the request of 
Ms. Clarke, who found it intrusive.
