<HEADLINE> Recordings Uncover Mystery of Seals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The seal took a deep breath and dived 330 feet  
below the thick Antarctic ice sheet, stalking dinner in the 
freezing depths for 20 minutes before it emerged again for air. 
</P>
<P>
	Now a marine biologist has devised a way to virtually go along  
for the dive. By strapping a tiny video camera and data recorder to 
the 1,000-pound animals, biologist Randall Davis got the first 
``seal's-eye view'' of a long-standing mystery: how marine mammals 
hunt. 
</P>
<P>
	Among his findings: Seals have sharper eyesight than anyone  
believed, letting them hunt by sight instead of using sound, as 
previously thought. If a fish tries to hide in a tiny crevice in 
the ice, a seal literally blows it out into the water to give 
chase. And the seals can navigate back to a small air hole in the 
ice even after traveling more than a mile underwater. 
</P>
<P>
	``Terrestrial biologists have the advantage of being able to go  
out and observe their animals fairly easily. But ... we know 
basically nothing about underwater behavior,'' said Davis, who 
reports the first data from his three-dimensional tapes in the 
journal Science on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This technology allows us to travel vicariously with these  
animals to great depths and for the first time look at their 
behavior, ... foraging tactics, how do they stalk their prey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, a marine biologist at Texas A&AMP;M University, strapped the  
data packs to the heads of Weddell seals, huge but fairly friendly 
animals that hunt under the ice shelves of Antartica. The packs 
combine a video recorder and equipment to gather information on 
sound, depth, direction, water speed, even flipper strokes -- 
basically everything the seal did and experienced once it dived 
under the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	The first surprise from the nearly 100 hours of tape: Seals may  
squawk a lot while lounging around on rocks, but they're stealth 
hunters, coming within inches of large fish without the prey 
noticing. 
</P>
<P>
	And they don't appear to use sound -- sonar or echolocation -- to  
hunt, relying instead on eyes highly developed for peering through 
the murk below the 6-foot-deep ice. Davis' tapes show a seal 
gliding under a 100-pound Antarctic cod and tracking its silhouette 
in the dim light before moving in for the kill. 
</P>
<P>
	Another discovery was a novel hunting technique: The seal wanted  
some smaller fish that tried to hide inside crevices under the ice, 
so it blew a blast of air from its nostrils into the crevice. Out 
fled the fish, ripe for capture. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is really advancing our understanding of underwater  
foraging behavior,'' said Polly Penhale of the National Science 
Foundation, which paid for the research. ``You're getting a totally 
unique, three-dimensional picture of what the animal is doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weddell seals in particular had fascinated researchers because  
of how long they dive without breathing. Twenty minutes is typical, 
but Davis recorded a 65-minute dive. The longest dive ever recorded 
is an astounding 82 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The seals spend most of their waking hours beneath the ice  
shelves, but they congregate around 4-feet-wide holes through which 
they emerge to gulp air. Davis' recordings show they can dive 1,000 
feet deep and swim almost 2 miles away from those holes yet 
unerringly find their way back before running out of air. 
</P>
<P>
	``These seals not only have to locate and capture prey, but they  
do it while holding their breath, and in such a way that they can 
find their way back to a fairly isolated breathing hole or they'll 
drown,'' Davis explained. ``That's a small point to locate in a 
fairly broad sheath of ice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How do they do it? When Davis returns in October to Sound,  
Antarctica, he will continue researching how the seals navigate 
accurately. 
</P>
<P>
	But as for holding their breath, it seems they have incredibly  
complex biology. Their blood and muscles have three to five times 
more oxygen-carrying capacity than humans', enough to survive those 
typical 20-minute dives. 
</P>
<P>
	For longer dives, their bodies actually alter blood circulation  
to sequester oxygen in the brain and heart -- the rest of the body 
simply goes without, Davis said. That's very stressful and painful, 
and requires hours to recuperate, so really long dives are rare. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis' work has implications beyond seals: If scientists  
miniaturize the data pack a little more, they also could see into 
the alien world of other undersea creatures, even large diving 
birds, said Penhale of the NSF. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's advances like these that pique the interest of scientists  
to push the technology to the limits,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
                       *By The Associated Press    	
</P>
<P>
	How did researchers get 3-D images of seals hunting under  
6-foot-deep ice shelves in the Antarctic? With miniaturized 
technology and a little glue. 
</P>
<P>
	The small video camera and data pack is mounted on the back of  
the seal's head, so the lens peers over the top of the head to show 
researchers everything the animal sees. The data pack records dive 
depth, direction, speed -- all the details needed for a 
three-dimensional view of the seal's dive. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists glued a rubber mounting pad onto the seal's fur, and  
then clipped the ``seal-cam'' to that pad. Thus, when seals emerge 
for air, it's easy to unclip the pack and retrieve the recordings. 
</P>
<P>
	And when the animals shed their coats later in the season, the  
little glued-on pad comes off, too. 
</P>
<P>
	The camera isn't heavy enough to interfere with the usual diving  
habits of a 1,000-pound seal, researchers say.

<HEADLINE> Poor Nations Seek Global Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTEGO BAY, Jamaica (AP) -- Leaders from cash-poor, mineral-rich  
developing nations went into seclusion Thursday to grapple with 
ways to help their economies survive in the global economy. 
</P>
<P>
	One suggestion at the Group of 15 summit came from Mexican  
Foreign Minister Rosario Green, who proposed that the G-15 act as a 
representative for developing countries before the industrialized 
world. Her suggestion late Wednesday was seconded by Sri Lanka. 
</P>
<P>
	The Group of 15 has grown to 17 member states and includes  
Algeria, Argentina, Chile, India, Kenya, Nigeria, Peru, Senegal and 
Zimbabwe. 
</P>
<P>
	G-15 states account for 30 percent of the world's population and  
produce $2 trillion in goods, or nearly 40 percent of the gross 
domestic product of all developing nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Commonly-accepted panaceas of fiscal austerity and open  
economies, many here say, are only bringing more turmoil. But the 
idea of negotiating better terms of trade and aid as a bloc will 
trigger opposition from international lending and trade 
institutions, delegates say. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be in-built resistance to opening the  
(international) decision-making process'' to poorer countries, said 
Jamaican roving Ambassador Anthony Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Some G-15 members, including Egypt, a major U.S. aid recipient,  
viewed as confrontational an appeal by Venezuelan President Hugo 
Chavez for solidarity and regional cooperation, Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
	Egyptian delegates wanted to ensure that a communique to be  
released at the end of the summit Friday use ``non-confrontational 
language,'' Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
	The G-15 wants to slow the race to globalization and curb  
reckless currency speculation in emerging markets by international 
financiers they blame in part for their woes. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamaican Prime Minister P.J. Patterson backed a proposal by  
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad for a worldwide system to 
regulate financial markets, particularly speculators in short-term 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pace of globalization ... has outstripped the capacity of  
governments to provide the necessary framework to ensure 
stability,'' Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahathir wanted strong language in the communique on regulating  
markets, Hill said. But not all countries agree: Brazil and Mexico, 
for example, see opportunities from investments by short-term 
speculators. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders hoped to resolve those differences by Friday, Hill said.  
</P>
<P>
	``We may not sing in harmony, but we at least want to be singing  
from the same hymn sheet,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Smoker Awarded $51.5 Million in Damages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- When Patricia Henley was 15, she watched  
sultry star Susan Hayward smoke on the big screen. It was cool. It 
was glamorous. She said no one told her it might be deadly. 
</P>
<P>
	Three decades later, the former three-pack-a-day smoker with  
inoperable lung cancer convinced a jury that Philip Morris Cos. 
concealed the risks and addictiveness of smoking, and the panel 
rewarded her by returning the largest verdict ever in a tobacco 
lawsuit filed by an individual -- $51.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel wonderful,'' said Ms. Henley, who pledged to donate any  
money she receives to educate youngsters about the dangers of 
smoking. ``This is a great day for the children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Henley, 52, won $50 million in punitive damages Wednesday on  
top of $1.5 million in compensation awarded by the Superior Court 
jury a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Although no similar verdict against the tobacco industry has  
survived on appeal, some say Ms. Henley's case marks a change in 
fortune for cigarette makers. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Stanton Glantz, a University of California, San Francisco  
professor of medicine who published a book in 1996 that exposed 
tobacco industry documents, said he believes plaintiffs' lawyers 
have learned from mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you're just beginning to see the beginning of the dam  
burst,'' he said. ``The evidence of wrongdoing by the industry is 
getting overwhelming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Henley thought she had pneumonia when she started coughing  
and having trouble singing. She was about to record a country and 
western music compact disc when she finally sought help. 
</P>
<P>
	She was diagnosed a year ago with inoperable cancer. Ms. Henley  
was forced to quit smoking and educate herself about what was in 
all those Marlboros. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went from knowing nothing to knowing too much,'' she said.  
``We went into this case figuring we'd never beat big business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She sued Philip Morris in May.  
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer, Madelyn Chaber, asked a jury of five men and seven  
women to ``send a message back to this company that the price of 
human life cannot be calculated into the cost of doing business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Punitive damages were the only way to get the attention of a  
company worth $3.5 billion, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the 12 jurors, including jury foreman George Loudis,  
voted against awarding the $50 million in punitive damages. He 
supported punitive damages of $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our decision was based on a lot of evidence, the suppression  
of known facts by Philip Morris,'' Loudis said. ``They had a lot of 
information they just didn't give out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Ohlemeyer, who represents Philip Morris, said Wednesday  
that the company would appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The jurors unfortunately let their feelings of sympathy get in  
the way,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is California's first since the repeal of a 1987 state  
law that banned lawsuits by cigarette smokers on the basis that the 
risks of smoking were well known. Dozens of cases pending at the 
time were dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, then-state Attorney General Dan Lungren joined justice  
officials in other states in suing the tobacco industry, and the 
state Legislature repealed the ban on individual lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	The tobacco industry reached a $206 billion legal settlement  
with states in November, but cigarette makers still face individual 
and class-action claims. 
</P>
<P>
	However, jury awards in such cases are rare. Two verdicts in  
Florida and one in New Jersey against cigarette makers were all 
overturned by appeals courts. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Ms. Henley's lung cancer is in remission, she said it's  
not likely she'll live to see her granddaughters, ages 2 and 10, 
grow up. 
</P>
<P>
	``My battle's over. It's just a matter of time,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Rep. Tells FCC To Shelve Radio Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A key telecommunications lawmaker urged  
federal regulators Thursday to shelve plans for a new, very local 
radio service that could be used by churches, students and 
community groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``I request that you take no further actions on this agenda,''  
Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., chairman of the House Commerce 
telecommunications subcommittee, said in a letter to FCC Chairman 
Bill Kennard. 
</P>
<P>
	Tauzin is worried that Federal Communications Commission  
proposals for a low-power service would create interference to 
existing stations and could cut into advertising for minority and 
other radio stations, said spokesman Ken Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``The policy, political, economic and budgetary ramifications of  
this undertaking are potentially staggering,'' Tauzin wrote. ``I do 
not believe you should proceed with this matter'' without 
consulting with Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC Chairman Bill Kennard indicated he has no intention of  
abandoning the proposals. ``The radio airwaves are big enough for 
all of us,'' Kennard said. ``There is enough room for the voices of 
churches, schools and neighborhood groups as well as established 
radio companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Broadcasters opposes the FCC's  
proposals, offered last month, saying they would ``likely cause 
devastating interference'' to existing radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NAB is just like a schoolyard bully: First time someone  
stands up to them they go running for their older brother,'' said 
Andy Schwartzman, president of the Media Access Project, a group 
that supports the new low-power radio service. 
</P>
<P>
	Tauzin, for the most part, has been a friend of the broadcasting  
industry. If the FCC doesn't halt its plans and consult with 
Congress on the matter, then Tauzin may ``intervene 
legislatively,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is widespread grass-roots support'' for the FCC's  
proposals, contends Michael Bracy, head of the Low Power Radio 
Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	In remarks to radio broadcasters Thursday, Tauzin expressed  
concern that the new service could be used by racist groups. FCC 
officials have said that the licensing process wouldn't 
automatically disqualify a person or group based on their political 
views -- even if those views are white supremacist, for example, or 
offensive in some other way. 
</P>
<P>
	To get a higher-power license, companies generally must show  
they want to serve a particular area. They must also provide 
information about any past criminal record. The FCC has proposed 
having new low power stations meet the same standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Tauzin also believes the FCC is overstepping its legal authority  
by advancing the proposals, Johnson said. But FCC officials said 
the commission clearly has authority to act in this area. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission's proposals would create thousands of licensed  
low-tech FM radio stations from 1 watt to 1,000 watts. That would 
reverse a roughly 20-year-old ban against such licenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC's action also responds to consolidation in the radio  
industry, which has made it increasingly difficult for minorities 
and community groups to make their voices heard. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Rep. Michael Oxley, R-Ohio, said he was ``troubled''  
that the FCC paid an advocacy group, the Civil Rights Forum on 
Communications Policy, to conduct a study on advertising practices. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, released last month, said that advertisers often  
bypass or pay less money to minority-owned radio stations geared to 
black or Hispanic listeners. 
</P>
<P>
	Oxley, in a letter to Kennard, questioned whether it was  
appropriate for the FCC to use the group and whether government 
contracting regulations were followed.

<HEADLINE> Cruise Lines Watch Airline Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Cruise lines are watching the American Airlines pilots' labor  
dispute with some trepidation as thousands of people prepare to fly 
into Miami this weekend to begin cruises. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a hell of a big weekend for flying somewhere because of  
President's Day and Valentine's Day,'' said Rich Steck, a spokesman 
for Royal Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnival, Norwegian, Premier and Royal Caribbean cruise lines  
said the job action by American pilots hadn't caused major 
problems, but the companies were monitoring negotiations between 
the pilots union and airline in case they need to make alternative 
plans for passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of American Airlines' flights were grounded  
Thursday even though a judge ordered the pilots back to work the 
day before. The airline is the largest carrier at Miami 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the cruise lines avoided serious problems because their  
ships set sail last weekend and weren't scheduled to return until 
this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Royal Caribbean's Vision of the Seas, however, left its San Juan  
port 1 1/2 hours late Wednesday night because 100 passengers and crew 
members had to be flown in on a charter plane after American 
flights from Miami were canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	The big worry was for the upcoming weekend.  
</P>
<P>
	A quarter of the 22,000 cruise passengers expected to sail on  
Royal Caribbean ships from Fort Lauderdale, Los Angeles, Miami and 
San Juan were scheduled to fly with American Airlines, Steck said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're working with American Airlines on alternative measures  
but it's hard to plan anything when nothing has happened,'' Steck 
said. ``We believe the airlines will be flying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norwegian, anticipating a busy holiday weekend, had already  
booked charter flights to bring its passengers from the Northeast 
to Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnival was expecting four of it ships to return to Miami this  
weekend and leave the same day with a new batch of passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still keeping a close eye on the situation,'' said  
spokeswoman Jennifer de la Cruz. ``This situation is continuing to 
unfold.''

<HEADLINE> McEnroe To Close Art Gallery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- John McEnroe must have decided art isn't his  
game. 
</P>
<P>
	The former tennis champion has decided to close his gallery in  
New York's trendy SoHo neighborhood, said his father, John P. 
McEnroe. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had his eyes opened a little bit by the whole experience,''  
the senior McEnroe said Thursday of his son's stint with the 
downtown gallery, which sold contemporary art. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had such an interest in art and a love for art ... and I  
think he found, in fact, it's a cutthroat business,'' said the 
father, who served as lawyer for the John McEnroe Gallery. ``I 
don't think he'd be closing it if he was making money hand over 
fist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The younger McEnroe, who won seven Grand Slam titles and  
recently was elected to the tennis Hall of Fame, was in Uruguay for 
a tennis tournament, his father said.

<HEADLINE> Steelers' Lake Is Now Free Agent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Rod Woodson. Chad Brown. Kevin Greene. Neil  
O'Donnell. Yancey Thigpen. The Pittsburgh Steelers have a history 
of letting star players leave via free agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The next to go might be Carnell Lake.  
</P>
<P>
	The Steelers declined Thursday to name Lake as their franchise  
player, a decision that allows the four-time Pro Bowl defensive 
back to negotiate with any other NFL team. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Steelers who became free agents at midnight were wide  
receiver Charles Johnson, defensive lineman Oliver Gibson, 
linebacker Donta Jones, running back Fred McAfee, kicker Norm 
Johnson, fullback Tim Lester and strong safety Lee Flowers. 
</P>
<P>
	Lake has been the Steelers' franchise player since 1995, but the  
Steelers chose not to give any player that designation before the 4 
p.m. deadline Thursday. They considered putting the tag on tight 
end Mark Bruener until reaching terms with him late Tuesday on a 
$10 million, four-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	As with most Steelers' offseason personnel moves, money was a  
determining factor in the Lake decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Lake started all 16 games at cornerback last season, the  
Steelers had to pay him a salary comparable to the five 
highest-paid players at his position -- or about $4.5 million -- to 
retain him as their franchise player. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Steelers want Lake back only as a safety, the  
position he played for most of his career. Lake made midseason 
moves to cornerback in 1995 and 1997 and played there full-time in 
1998 after Chad Scott badly injured a knee in a preseason workout 
and sat out the entire season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would love to have him back, and he has said he would love  
to stay here,'' Steelers director of football operations Tom 
Donahoe said of Lake. ``But he would have to be paid as a 
cornerback (to remain the franchise player).'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cleveland Browns, who passed on choosing high-profile  
players during this week's expansion draft, are among the teams 
interested in Lake, who reportedly wants as much as $5 million per 
year under a multiyear contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Lake, who will be 32 in July, made $1.7 million in base salary  
last season and averaged nearly $2.4 million under the four-year 
contract he signed in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	It appears Lake will re-sign with Pittsburgh only if he does not  
attract much interest on the open market and the Steelers don't 
sign or draft a free safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``I figure he'll be fairly popular around the NFL. He plays the  
two positions, and there were people talking about him in the 1997 
season. ... So we think there will be some interest in him, but we 
will always give Pittsburgh the first option to sign him,'' Lake's 
agent, Leigh Steinberg, told KDKA-TV in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Darren Perry, also a free agent, isn't expected to return at  
free safety next season. The Steelers are talking contract with 
Flowers, who replaced Lake at strong safety last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't even know where I'll be next year,'' Lake said late  
last season. ``I hope I'm here, but those things will sort 
themselves out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lester, often the lead blocker for running back Jerome Bettis,  
probably will return. But Charles Johnson seems likely to leave, as 
does Gibson, who could attract multiple offers. The Jacksonville 
Jaguars are among the teams interested in him. 
</P>
<P>
	The Steelers have not offered a contract to Norm Johnson, their  
kicker the last four seasons. They did prevent Josh Miller from 
becoming a restricted free agent, signing him Thursday to a 
three-year contract that makes him one of the league's highest-paid 
punters.

<HEADLINE> Reno: No Comment on Starr Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,  
said Thursday the timing of news leaks about a Justice Department 
probe of possible prosecutorial wrongdoing by Independent Counsel 
Kenneth Starr smacks of partisanship. 
</P>
<P>
	``The articles appeared in the press while the Senate was  
conducting final deliberations on the articles of impeachment 
against President Clinton,'' Hatch wrote in a letter to Deputy 
Attorney General Eric Holder. 
</P>
<P>
	``The timing of these articles could not be more suspicious,''  
Hatch wrote. He warned Holder to be ready to answer questions about 
the matter Friday at a previously scheduled meeting with him. 
</P>
<P>
	Meeting with reporters earlier Thursday, Attorney General Janet  
Reno would not comment directly on news reports that the Justice 
Department will investigate whether Starr overstepped his bounds in 
the early days of the Monica Lewinsky investigation. Starr's 
Lewinsky investigation led eventually to Clinton's impeachment and 
Senate trial for alleged perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch, a frequent critic of Reno's handling of independent  
counsel matters, said the leaks apparently came from the Justice 
Department. He questioned whether prosecutors could conduct an 
impartial investigation of Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	``These press accounts once again call into question the  
department's integrity and support the impression many people have 
that this is a partisan Justice Department,'' Hatch wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., also complained of leaks to Reno,  
saying ``these attacks on the independent counsel'' just before the 
Senate impeachment vote ``are pernicious. They represent a 
politicization of the Department of Justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``While we are all well aware that presidential allies such as  
James Carville have declared war on Independent Counsel Starr, we 
would hope that the generals of that war would not be working at 
the Department of Justice,'' Burton wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno angered Hatch by refusing to seek independent counsels to  
investigate 1996 campaign fund-raising allegations related to 
Clinton, Vice President Gore and former White House aide Harold 
Ickes. In a television appearance Wednesday night, Hatch called 
Reno's department the most partisan Justice Department this 
century. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will provide whatever information is appropriate at the  
meeting'' with Hatch, Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno, asked about earlier criticism from Hatch, denied that she  
has taken sides as Starr pursued a variety of allegations against 
the Clinton White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a great respect for Senator Hatch,'' Reno said at her  
weekly press conference. ``And I think if he looked at the record, 
he would see that I've been damned by both sides and will continue 
to try to call it like I see it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno repeatedly parried questions about a Starr investigation,  
without confirming that one is imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I have said all along, I try not to comment with respect to  
the independent counsel's function,'' Reno told reporters. ``I 
will, however, continue to look to see how I may comment in a way 
that is fair to all concerned, consistent with the law and 
consistent with ethical considerations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno seemed somewhat frustrated that she could not go further.  
</P>
<P>
	``If I can determine a way to properly make a comment concerning  
this matter that would be fair to all concerned and would adhere to 
the law, I will do so,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several news organizations, including The Associated Press,  
reported this week that the Justice Department has advised Starr it 
intends to investigate actions of his office, including the Jan. 
16, 1998, offer to Ms. Lewinsky of an immunity deal on condition 
she not discuss it with her lawyer, Frank Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	A conservative legal group inserted itself into the issue  
Thursday. The Landmark Legal Foundation filed a request that the 
special three-judge panel of judges overseeing Starr's work block 
any Justice Department investigation of the prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	``This initiative by the attorney general -- the president's  
appointee -- is clearly calculated to undermine the independent 
counsel's investigation at a critical stage,'' the group claimed in 
court papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said Thursday no one would impede Starr's continuing work.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have tried my level best to do this the right way, to ensure  
that there was no effort whatsoever to interfere with his 
investigation,'' she said. ``And I am convinced that nothing has 
been done, but I will continue to work to ensure that result.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr was appointed more than four years ago to investigate the  
role of President Clinton and his wife in an Arkansas land deal and 
related matters. Reno approved Starr's request more than a year ago 
to expand his Whitewater inquiry into allegations related to 
Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.

<HEADLINE>  Greenspan Faults Clinton Bank Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan today  
extended his public disagreement with the Clinton administration 
over the best approach to take in overhauling the nation's 
financial services laws. 
</P>
<P>
	As Congress began this year's debate on legislation to remove  
Depression-era barriers between banks, brokerage firms and 
insurance companies, Greenspan endorsed a bill proposed by House 
Banking Committee Chairman Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, that would give 
the Federal Reserve more power over new financial activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's remarks in testimony prepared for a Banking  
Committee hearing put him at odds again with the administration's 
top economic policymaker, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
	Both men support revamping the laws by letting banks, brokerages  
and insurers get more deeply into each other's businesses. 
Legislation to do that died in Congress last year after getting 
closer to passage than it had in many years. 
</P>
<P>
	Leach's bill ``has chosen the appropriate structure to combine  
banking, securities and insurance firms (by) using financial 
service holding companies,'' Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The holding company requirement in the bill ``serves to promote  
the safety and soundness and stability of our banking and financial 
system,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan also brushed aside concerns from some consumer  
activists and Democratic lawmakers that legally breaking down 
barriers between financial industries could bring more megamergers 
and increase the concentration of economic power in a few hands. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to questions from Rep. Bernard Sanders of Vermont,  
Congress' lone independent, Greenspan said he didn't share those 
concerns because technology has brought ``a major increase in 
competitive pressures throughout this economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the administration threw its support behind a new,  
competing version of the financial overhaul legislation. That bill, 
proposed by Rep. John LaFalce of New York, the Banking Committee's 
senior Democrat, would lift the barriers between financial 
industries but preserve the split regulatory authority between the 
Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin called LaFalce's bill ``the best chance'' for gaining  
bipartisan support and eventual enactment. With the exception of a 
provision that would allow the mixing of banking and industrial 
activities, Rubin told reporters that the administration fully 
supports the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury, represented by Rubin, and the central bank,  
represented by Greenspan, have long been at odds over how to 
overhaul the existing Depression-era legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration wants to let banks diversify through  
subsidiaries of the bank itself, not just through affiliated 
companies within the same parent holding company. That arrangement 
would increase the power of the Treasury's Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency, regulator of nationally chartered 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side of the battle, bills letting banks into other  
kinds of financial activities through a holding company structure 
would expand the Fed's role in regulating financial services 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer activists, including Ralph Nader, have opposed previous  
versions of the legislation, saying it would concentrate financial 
power in a few hands and hurt consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., expressed concern that with a  
greater mixing of financial industries, regional banks could become 
``vacuum cleaners'' of smaller banks and then be taken over 
themselves by larger corporations. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin's comments Wednesday came as Wall Street titans, including  
the head of Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., urged Congress to enact financial 
overhaul legislation, a version of which died last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch chairman and chief executive officer David  
Komansky appealed to patriotism in exhorting the banking regulators 
to stop feuding. 
</P>
<P>
	``If fiercely competitive financial firms can set aside our  
parochial interests and achieve consensus, surely our government 
agencies can do the same,'' Komansky testified. ``For the sake of 
our nation, all of us need to focus less on turf and more on common 
ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without financial revamping legislation, he warned, ``We're  
speeding into the 21st century in a vehicle that was designed in 
1933.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Komansky was referring to the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act, which  
erected the barriers separating the financial services industries 
at a time when the government feared that banks would become too 
powerful. 
</P>
<P>
	John McCoy, president and chief executive of Bank One Corp., who  
appeared with Komansky, was asked by a lawmaker which approach he 
would prefer, Treasury's or the Fed's. ``I basically believe that 
we can be supportive either way,'' he replied. 
</P>
<P>
	The parade of industry officials testifying in favor of sweeping  
financial legislation also included Michael Patterson, vice 
chairman of investment bank J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co.; Richard Huber, 
chairman, president and CEO of insurance giant Aetna Inc.; Roy 
Zuckerberg, partner in Wall Street giant Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. and 
chairman of the Securities Industry Association; and Matthew Fink, 
president of the Investment Company Institute, which represents the 
mutual fund industry. 
</P>
<P>
	American consumers spend an estimated $300 billion a year on  
financial services. Backers of the overhaul legislation, some of 
whom have been pushing it in Congress for 20 years, say it is 
needed to keep the U.S. financial industry competitive in a 
fast-changing world.

	On Feb. 12, 1809, Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president of the  
United States, was born in present-day Larue County, Ky. 
</P>

People was founded. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1915, the cornerstone for the Lincoln Memorial was laid in  
Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1924, George Gershwin's ``Rhapsody in Blue'' premiered in New  
York. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1940, the radio play ``The Adventures of Superman'' debuted  
on the Mutual network with Bud Collyer as the Man of Steel. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1973, the first release of American prisoners of war from the  
Vietnam conflict took place. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, in a crime that shocked Britons, two 10-year-old boys  
lured 2-year-old James Bulger from his mother at a shopping mall in 
Liverpool and beat him to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago: The special prosecutor in the Iran-Contra case

<HEADLINE> Shell has fourth quarter losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The Royal Dutch-Shell Group of Cos. lost an  
unexpectedly large $3.7 billion in the fourth quarter, citing 
falling crude oil prices and the Asian recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Shell's profit for the year fell sharply and the energy company  
said Thursday any immediate improvement would be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Europe and the U.S., a possible economic slowdown could  
affect oil demand growth and may restrict any further upswing in 
the margins,'' the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shell shares dropped 2.7 percent in Amsterdam and 3.4 percent in  
London following the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss for the October-December period contrasted with a  
profit of $1.63 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue for the quarter fell 20 percent to $34.60 billion from  
$43.29 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said oil prices were 33 percent below a year ago and  
the Asian recession hurt profits in its chemical products business. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, earnings skidded to $350 million from $7.753  
billion in 1997. Revenue sank to $138.27 billion from $171.66 
billion in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Moody-Stuart, chairman of the committee of managing  
directors, said Shell's results were worse than for some of its 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is inescapable is that we have allowed the competition to  
overtake us,'' he told reporters in London. ``But I can tell you 
that we will reverse this situation by implementing the remedial 
measures we announced in December.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those included plans to dispose of eight chemicals business,  
closing four national head office and reducing investment by a 
third. 
</P>
<P>
	Moody-Stuart said the group is on course to achieve a 14 percent  
return on average capital employed by 2001, provided oil prices 
reach an average $14 a barrel by that time. 
</P>
<P>
	Brent crude oil is now selling at about $10 per barrel, and is  
likely to stay there for some time, he added.

<HEADLINE> Wasdin, Red Sox OK One-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Boston Red Sox and right-handed pitcher John  
Wasdin agreed Thursday to a $500,000, one-year deal, avoiding a 
salary arbitration hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The 26-year-old Wasdin, who made $227,500 last season with the  
Red Sox, had submitted a figure of $675,000 and Boston had offered 
$430,000. He was the team's last player in arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	Wasdin was 6-4 with a 5.25 ERA in 47 games last season. He made  
eight starts and 39 relief appearances. In three seasons, he is 
19-18 with a 5.19 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Wasdin can make up to $100,000 in bonuses. If he makes 10  
starts, he can make $20,000. He earns another $25,000 when he 
reaches 15 and 20 starts. If he reaches 25, he gets another 
$30,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox acquired Wasdin in a trade with the Oakland  
Athletics in January 1997.

<HEADLINE> 16 Hospitalized by Mysterious Spray </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Twenty-one people were hospitalized Thursday  
after an unidentified man sprayed a mysterious substance on a local 
commuter train. 
</P>
<P>
	The fumes caused chest pains, respiratory problems and eye  
irritation among the victims, who were given oxygen and then washed 
down with a water and bleach solution before they were transported 
to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the victims were expected to be released. A 14-year-old  
boy was in critical condition.

<HEADLINE> Grudzielanek Loses at Arbitration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Dodgers won their salary  
arbitration case with infielder Mark Grudzielanek on Thursday, but 
general manager Kevin Malone was in no mood to celebrate upon 
hearing of the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory and a win by the Kansas City Royals over outfielder  
Johnny Damon gave the owners a 4-0 lead over players in cases 
decided this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Grudzielanek, eligible for arbitration for the first time, will  
be paid $1.9 million rather than the $2.6 million he requested, 
arbitrator Nicholas Zumas ruled after hearing arguments Wednesday 
in Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers acquired the 28-year-old Grudzielanek from Montreal  
last July 31. He hit a combined .272 with 10 homers and 62 RBIs 
while earning $350,000 last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to get it resolved, but I don't like the process,''  
Malone said. ``I think whoever thought of it definitely didn't know 
anything about baseball or championship teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the salary arbitration process is one of the worst  
things about major league baseball. You go through a process 
pointing out all the things a player can't do, and a week later 
expect him to be a key member of your club without some negative 
effects. I don't see any victories today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owners also won the first two cases of the year, beating Boston  
outfielder Midre Cummings and Montreal infielder Shane Andrews.

<HEADLINE> Meissnitzer Wins Giant Slalom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- Austria's Alexandra Meissnitzer overtook  
teammate Anita Wachter on the second run of the women's giant 
slalom Thursday to claim her second gold medal in the World Alpine 
Ski Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	The silver medal went to Norway's Andrine Flemmen and the bronze  
to Wachter. 
</P>
<P>
	Meissnitzer, who also won gold in the super-G last week, trailed  
first-run leader Wachter by .21 seconds after the first run. 
Flemmen stood third, .55 seconds off the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Quick second runs by Sweden's Pernilla Wiberg and Switzerland's  
Corinne Rey Bellet put pressure on the leaders, but Flemmen 
responded with the third-fastest time on the second heat of 1 
minute, 6.57 seconds to momentarily take the lead with a combined 
time of 2:08.84. 
</P>
<P>
	The steady Meissnitzer than flashed across in an almost  
identical 1:06.61 for a total of 2:08.54. 
</P>
<P>
	Wachter was faster than Meissnitzer through the first  
intermediate clocking but lost time in the middle of the course, 
and her 1:07.41 left her at 2:09.13. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm feeling very happy,'' Meissnitzer said. ``On the first  
run, the course was very fast, and it was very close. I knew I had 
to give everything in the second run. I knew I needed to be fast, 
but I wasn't scared. I tried to make speed in every turn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wiberg, ninth after the first run, had the quickest second run  
of 1:05.93 to climb to fourth overall in 2:09.27. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's Martina Ertl was fifth in 2:09.46, followed by Rey  
Bellet in 2:09.52. Italy's Deborah Compagnoni, the defending world 
champion in giant slalom who also won the event in the 1998 
Olympics, was seventh in 2:09.90. 
</P>
<P>
	Rounding out the top 10 were Slovenia's Spela Pretnar in  
2:09.98, France's Leila Piccard in 2:10.18 and Sweden's Anna 
Ottosson in 2:10.30. 
</P>
<P>
	The top North American was Canada's Allison Forsyth, who  
finished 16th in 2:11.75. Kirsten Clark of Raymond, Maine, was the 
top American, winding up 22nd in 2:12.67. 
</P>
<P>
	Meissnitzer, the World Cup overall and giant slalom leader who  
has won three out of six GS races this season and has never 
finished off the podium, maintained her dominance in the event. The 
25-year-old Meissnitzer was second in the giant slalom in the '98 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	She and Wachter gave Austria its 11th and 12th medals in these  
championships. Runner-up Norway has six. 
</P>
<P>
	``After finishing fourth in the downhill and failing to medal  
(on Sunday), I've been kind of angry for a few days,'' Meissnitzer 
said. ``That gave me motivation today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flemmen said she told herself before the race ``that if I got a  
medal, I would be very, very satisfied. And I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her coach, Erik Skaslien, was the course-setter for the first  
run, and Thursday was his 34th birthday. ``He said he didn't want 
any present, he wanted good skiing,'' Flemmen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bronze medal marked Wachter's eighth appearance on the  
podium in races at Vail, one of her favorite venues. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a slight slip during her first run, Wachter was timed in  
1:01.72. The 31-year-old Wachter, who contemplated retirement after 
suffering a knee injury last season, is a two-time winner in giant 
slalom this season on the World Cup circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``This medal is very important to me because after my injury,  
nobody thought I would come back,'' Wachter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meissnitzer had a first-run clocking of 1:01.93, and Flemmen  
stood third in 1:02.27.

<HEADLINE> Navy Officer Blames Russian Laser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A U.S. naval intelligence officer said  
Thursday he has agonizing and permanent eye damage from what he 
said was a laser beam fired at his helicopter from a Russian cargo 
ship he was monitoring. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Jack Daly told a House Armed Services subcommittee that he's  
not surprised the Pentagon can't support his claim. The Coast Guard 
didn't board the Russian ship to look for the suspected laser until 
three days after he was hit, Daly said, and then only after giving 
the Russian captain 24 hours' advance notice. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may have walked off the ship in a gym bag with a crew  
member'' at the dock in Tacoma, Wash., Daly testified. 
</P>
<P>
	The April 1997 incident occurred in the Juan de Fuca Strait  
north of Washington state's Puget Sound. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon investigated the episode and said medical  
examinations showed injuries to Daly's right eye were consistent 
with damage that might be expected from a laser device. But it said 
``no evidence'' was found to prove it was a laser, no laser was 
found on the ship, and the Russian captain denied having such 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Daly, who said he was taking pictures of the Russian ship  
at the time, and the pilot of the Canadian helicopter received eye 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the Pentagon's claim at the time that the eye damage to  
both was minor and temporary, Daly said, both he and the Canadian 
air force pilot, Capt. Patrick Barnes, ``suffered irreparable eye 
damage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While he had perfect vision before the incident, Daly testified  
he now has 24-hour pain in his right eye, can't drive at night and 
can't go to movies or night ball games. 
</P>
<P>
	The only relief he gets is sitting in the dark with his eyes  
closed, ``yet lately even that does not seem to help much,'' he 
said, and his vision is deteriorating because of scar tissue. 
</P>
<P>
	The testimony before the Armed Services procurement subcommittee  
came at a hearing on whether the services are protecting members 
adequately from unconventional warfare, including laser attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO pilots and crew members were ordered to wear protective  
glasses last October after two American helicopter crew members 
sustained minor corneal burns, apparently from a laser. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly said he had been monitoring the Kapitan Man, believing that  
the Russian vessel was engaged in surveillance of American 
submarines in the vicinity, even though it was legally operating as 
a merchant ship. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., the subcommittee chairman, said  
Daly appeared to be the victim not just of a Russian laser but 
bureaucratic bungling by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter said any officer aboard the ship caught with a laser  
device on his desk when the U.S. boarding party finally showed up 
would have to be ``the dumbest officer in Russia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, Hunter disclosed that the same Russian freighter  
was boarded in 1993 by the Coast Guard and submarine surveillance 
equipment confiscated from it. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter suggested that all Russian ships be banned from Puget  
Sound, as they were during the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
	Rear Admiral Lowell Jacoby, director of naval intelligence, did  
not dispute Daly's account of the alleged laser incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's described the problem,'' Jacoby testified, noting that  
the Kapitan Man ``was being watched closely. It was a suspicious 
ship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said it and other Russian merchant ships have had ``numerous  
close encounters'' with Navy submarines in the close quarters of 
the Juan de Fuca Strait. 
</P>
<P>
	Army Lt. Gen. Paul Kern told the subcommittee that protective  
eye wear is being issued to those in the service who might be 
exposed to laser attacks, including pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the filters that block laser beams also reduce  
vision at night -- and some leave the eye vulnerable to laser beams 
from the side. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly said he was not wearing protective eye wear at the time.  
</P>
<P>
	``It seemed like a routine surveillance trip,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> NFL Holds Off Houston, LA Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue told potential  
NFL franchise hopefuls in Houston and Los Angeles not to attend a 
meeting in Atlanta next week to discuss which city will get the 
league's 32nd franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston businessman Bob McNair and two Los Angeles groups were  
scheduled to be at the owners' meeting to make presentations but 
Tagliabue told all three groups Tuesday the owners had decided that 
the session in Atlanta would be for discussion only and no final 
decisions would be made. 
</P>
<P>
	McNair was not discouraged by the notice.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a reflection of the challenge that the  
commissioner has in trying to develop a consensus to go ahead and 
expand,'' McNair said Wednesday. ``He (Tagliabue) told me at the 
Super Bowl his No. 1 priority was to develop that consensus and at 
that point in time he didn't have more than one-third of the 
members ready to move and do anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All three groups made presentations at the Super Bowl. A  
decision could be reached at the NFL meetings in Phoenix next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Los Angeles is considered the favorite over Houston  
because of its large media market, McNair said the delays in 
reaching a decision meant Houston still was in the running. 
</P>
<P>
	``What this shows is that in spite of all the talk of Los  
Angeles being the second largest media market and they have a lock 
on the franchise, this shows they don't,'' McNair said. ``It's not 
a decision for LA. The reason is we probably have more votes than 
they (Los Angeles) do. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NFL wants to be in both cities, Los Angeles and Houston,  
but those who thought LA would steamroll Houston, they've got 
another thought coming. It ain't going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Houston has proposed a $310 million retractable-roof stadium in  
the parking lot of the current Astrodome. Taxpayers would provide 
$195 million of the cost. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Patterson, executive vice president of McNair's Houston  
NFL Holdings, Inc., thinks Houston still has a chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has certainly been reporting that the game is over,''  
Patterson said. ``If the game was over, I think they would be 
voting on Feb. 16. Obviously, they're still working on it.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. To Add Oil to Crisis Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government will add to the petroleum  
reserves being hoarded as a protection against times of oil crisis, 
the Clinton administration announced Thursday, saying the move 
would improve the country's energy security. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson unveiled a plan to add 28  
million barrels to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, replenishing 
oil that was sold off by the government in recent years to raise 
revenue for federal spending elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The move makes economic sense at a time when oil prices are at  
historic lows, Richardson told a news conference. While the oil 
currently in the reserve cost an average $27 a barrel, new oil 
could be added for less than $12 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American taxpayer wins because oil prices are low and we  
store for a rainy day,'' Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The reserve, conceived as a billion-barrel cushion to protect  
against supply disruptions like the 1970s Arab oil embargo, now 
stands at 563 million barrels -- enough to replace 62 days of 
imports. 
</P>
<P>
	Some lawmakers are pressing the administration to completely  
fill the reserve, which is about 119 million barrels shy of full 
capacity. ``If I'm disappointed in anything about today's decision, 
it's that it did not go far enough,'' said Rep. Mac Thornberry, 
R-Texas, who last week introduced legislation similar to the plan 
put forth by Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was well received within the energy industry and on  
Capitol Hill, where Oil Patch lawmakers have been prodding the 
administration to help domestic producers reeling from depressed 
crude oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is good to see certain officials in the administration  
finally have recognized a need to protect our nation's energy 
security,'' said Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee 
Chairman Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, co-chair of the  
Congressional Oil and Gas Caucus: ``Instability in the Middle East 
and increasingly volatile oil markets require every effort to 
ensure our nation has an adequate emergency supply.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration proposal, which doesn't require congressional  
approval, would add up to 100,000 barrels daily to the reserve 
stored in underground salt caverns in Texas and Louisiana. The oil 
would come from companies drilling on federal leases in the Gulf of 
Mexico. Instead of paying their royalties in cash, the producers 
would make their payments ``in kind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Domestic producers, who have seen prices plunge 55 percent over  
two years because of a worldwide glut, have been clamoring for help 
from Washington as their industry has sustained thousands of job 
losses and tens of thousands of idled wells. 
</P>
<P>
	Gil Thurm, president of the Independent Petroleum Association of  
America, praised the reserve replenishment as ``a first step on the 
road to preserving our nation's ability to continue to supply our 
energy needs and avoid complete reliance on uncertain and unstable 
international markets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, Thurm added: ``Much more remains to be done.''  
</P>
<P>
	Federal oil purchases likely would do little to increase world  
oil prices, which are at Depression-era lows when adjusted for 
inflation, Petroleum Industry Research Foundation analyst John 
Lichtblau told a Senate committee recently. 
</P>
<P>
	While acknowledging the plan does little for the small producers  
who have been among the most affected by low prices, Richardson 
pledged help for them in a series of announcements due next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to help our domestic industry. They are hurting. We  
recognize that,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Caribbean Hurt By Airline Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) -- Caribbean tourism officials urged  
the region's small airlines to band together to offer alternatives 
to American Airlines, where a labor dispute plagued more travelers 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	American and its American Eagle subsidiary operate about 70  
percent of all flights to and within the Caribbean, and regional 
governments are worried the slowdown may affect the flow of U.S. 
tourists in the peak winter season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot continue where we are exposed to the whim and fancy  
of major carriers when this is in fact our critical industry,'' 
said Jean Holder, secretary-general of the Barbados-based Caribbean 
Tourism Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to somehow put together air transportation that is  
Caribbean-controlled,'' Holder said, urging leaders to meet to 
discuss ways to strengthen air transport in the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. judge on Wednesday ordered American's pilots to end the  
protest, but American said it was canceling another 29 flights 
Thursday to its regional hub in San Juan, Puerto Rico, because of a 
lack of crews. It predicted at least three more days of problems. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, more than 350,000 travelers have been stranded since  
Saturday, when American pilots began protesting lower wages paid to 
pilots from Reno Air, which American purchased in December. 
</P>
<P>
	American has offered hundreds of Caribbean travelers refunds for  
canceled flights, prompting hotel cancellations throughout the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
	Tourism organizations have repeatedly urged money-losing  
Caribbean airlines to combine some maintenance, ground handling and 
other operations to save money and add routes that could compete 
with American. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials recalled a short-lived American strike in 1997 that  
cost hoteliers and cruise operators millions of dollars. ``The 
Caribbean has been the greatest loser in this kind of 
uncertainty,'' Holder said.

	Senate Vote on Clinton Is Friday  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- By midday on Friday, the Senate is expected to  
decide the fate of President Clinton at his impeachment trial. The 
president seems certain to remain in office. Senators, wrapping up 
deliberations, are nearly ready to vote on charges of perjury and 
obstruction of justice. Olympia Snowe of Maine on Thursday became 
the fourth Republican senator to vow to acquit. A Senate censure of 
the president appears unlikely because of GOP opposition. But 
failing passage of a censure, Democrats promise to draft a 
condemnation.

year ago, Mrs. Tripp told NBC that ``the public has no clue ... 
absolutely no idea what Monica (Lewinsky) endured. ... the 
histrionics, the hysteria, the throwing of lamps, the damage to 
herself.'' Mrs. Tripp claimed that Clinton ``emotionally abused'' 
the former White House intern.

	Gun Makers Are Found Liable

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal jury found several gun makers liable  
on Thursday in three shootings because of negligent marketing 
practices. The verdict could set a precedent for cities trying to 
recoup the costs of gun violence. The jury ordered that Steven Fox, 
19, the only survivor in the New York area shootings, be paid 
$560,000. Defendants were accused of dumping handguns onto the 
market while making no effort to identify and discipline dishonest 
distributors.

	Grounded Oil Ship Burns

	COOS BAY, Ore. (AP) -- Experts set off explosives Thursday night  
and lit a oil-filled cargo ship on fire in a bid to save Oregon's 
beaches. Flames soared hundreds of feet from the New Carissa as 
smoke drifted along the coast. The Japanese-owned freighter ran 
aground Feb. 4 about 150 yards offshore with nearly 400,000 gallons 
of tarlike bunker oil. It began leaking Monday as pounding waves 
widened the cracks in the hull.

	American Cancels More Flights  
</P>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- More than half of American Airlines' flights were  
grounded Thursday as disgruntled pilots ignored a judge's 
back-to-work order. The nation's second-largest airline resumed 
contract talks with the pilots' union. U.S. District Judge Joe 
Kendall called a hearing for Friday on a request by American to 
hold the Allied Pilots Association in contempt. More than 380,000 
travelers have been stranded and 3,800 flights canceled since 
Saturday. Pilots are protesting the slow integration of recently 
purchased Reno Air into American's pay levels.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. warplanes attacked several Iraqi air

Iraqi military planes violate ``no-fly'' zones, the Pentagon said. 
The attacks occurred in both the northern and southern no-fly 
zones. U.S. pilots returned safely to their bases, according to the 
Pentagon, which denied an Iraqi report that gunners hit an allied 
plane in the north.

unknotted tie unraveled his career.

<P>
	John O'Brien Sr. said he was fired from the New York City Fire  
Bureau after he walked into a meeting with his tie undone.

	O'Brien said May 1997 meeting was informal, and added that he  
was on his way to investigate a fire scene at the time.

<HEADLINE> Romney May Head Salt Lake Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Massachusetts venture capitalist Mitt  
Romney is on the verge of taking over as the new head of Salt Lake 
City's scandal-scarred Olympics organizing committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney, the choice of Gov. Mike Leavitt and Salt Lake Organizing  
Committee chairman Robert Garff, met with members of a hastily 
organized selection committee Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	That came just hours after the SLOC ethics committee released  
its report saying bid committee executives engaged in unethical 
conduct in spending more than $1 million to curry favor with 24 
International Olympic Committee members and win the right to host 
the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney met Wednesday with members of the SLOC board, which was  
to be asked today to hire him as president and chief executive 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Also before the organizing committee today was a restructuring  
proposed by Leavitt and Garff. It would expand the board of 
trustees from 33 to 50 and strip it of its decision-making 
authority, making it an advisory board to a new management 
committee of 20. 
</P>
<P>
	One person familiar with the discussion said Frank Joklik, who  
resigned as CEO last month, and board members Spence Eccles, John 
Price, Don Cash and Gerald Sherratt were among those being 
considered for the management committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Joklik and Eccles have been among those criticized for their  
roles in Salt Lake's bid effort, but the ethics panel, while saying 
the bid committee trustees failed to oversee senior management, 
attached no particular blame to the two. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney, 51, a Republican who unsuccessfully challenged Sen. Ted  
Kennedy in 1994, is the son of the late George Romney, governor of 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	He lives in Belmont, Mass., and also has a home in Park City,  
Utah. He graduated from Mormon church-owned Brigham Young 
University in Provo, Utah, and has been a Mormon bishop (lay leader 
of a congregation) and stake president (leader of a group of 
congregations) in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney's Boston company, Bain Capital Inc., specializes in  
buying companies and turning them around. Domino's was a recent 
acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has the perfect business background. He knows how to take  
major businesses in trouble and turn them around,'' said Henry 
Marsh, one of a handful of board trustees asked by Garff on Tuesday 
to peruse applications for the top SLOC job. 
</P>
<P>
	A week ago, Garff conceded a search could be short-circuited if  
a universally approved candidate were found. Romney already was the 
clear choice by then, but Garff and Leavitt have declined to say 
so. 
</P>
<P>
	``We looked at stacks, dozens of resumes,'' Marsh said.  
</P>
<P>
	One businessmen who had been a potential candidate -- Jon  
Huntsman Jr. -- backed out after it became clear there would be no 
real search, he told The Associated Press. Huntsman, vice chairman 
of the $5 billion Huntsman Chemical Corp., said he also rejected 
Leavitt's request that he serve on SLOC's new management committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC ethics report linked an additional 10 IOC members to  
the scandal, bringing to 24 -- a fifth of the total membership -- the 
number of Olympic delegates accused of accepting excessive 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said the ethics report was being forwarded to its own  
six-man panel investigating the Salt Lake City case. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision-making IOC executive board expects to receive ``the  
earliest possible recommendations'' from the panel, the IOC said in 
a statement from Lausanne, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine members have either resigned or been expelled by the IOC  
executive board. Three others remain under investigation, one 
received a warning and one has died. 
</P>
<P>
	Further expulsions are likely before the special IOC assembly in  
Lausanne, March 17-18. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you find something that's a real breach, we basically have  
only one sanction, and that's expulsion,'' said IOC vice president 
Dick Pound, head of the internal inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC executive board delegate Jacques Rogge, a member of Pound's  
panel, said the commission will likely meet soon to review the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said he was not surprised that more members were  
implicated. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said a key issue for the IOC panel will be to determine  
whether members were guilty of actual ethical violations. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to differentiate between what is a breach of the  
line, and what is so-called `lavish treatment,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC marketing director Michael Payne, on a trip to the United  
States to meet with Olympic sponsors, said the IOC is doing 
everything in its power to stamp out corruption and institute 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the head of Olympics sponsor John Hancock insurance  
criticized the IOC's handling of the crisis and suggested that IOC 
president Juan Antonio Samaranch's tenure may be running out. 
</P>
<P>
	But Payne rejected the continuing calls from outside the IOC for  
Samaranch to resign, saying the 78-year-old president is needed to 
lead the house-cleaning efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the president stepped down, you would have a presidential  
election with all the instability that would bring,'' Payne said. 
``That's the last thing you want at this stage. You need a firm 
hand at the top to drive through the changes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite John Hancock's move, Payne said there was no crack in  
support from the Olympic sponsors who pay tens of millions of 
dollars to help finance the games. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sponsors are standing, first of all, behind the games,  
and, second, behind the steps and action the IOC, Samaranch and the 
executive board are taking,'' Payne said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--The IOC promised Wednesday to consider expelling more of them  
to restore its damaged credibility and assuage big-money sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will act decisively,'' said Anita DeFrantz, an IOC vice  
president from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	--Leavitt and US West denied there was a connection between a $5  
million Olympic contribution by the phone company and Leavitt 
pushing telecommunications deregulation. However, Leavitt said he 
was dropping deregulation from proposed legislature to wire Utah 
government and schools for fast Internet service. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Salt Lake bid committee's outside auditors, the accounting  
firm Ernst &AMP; Young, denied the ethics report's allegations that it 
had failed to call attention to undocumented expenditures by 
Olympic bid executives. 
</P>
<P>
	It said that it did identify and discuss undocumented  
expenditures with senior management and the chairman of SLOC's 
audit committee. However, James Beardall, chairman of the audit 
committee, was quoted in a copyright article in The Salt Lake 
Tribune as saying ``I was not made aware of undocumented financial 
expenses.... On the contrary, I was assured by the bid committee's 
auditors that there were no items of special significance not 
previously reported which should be brought to the attention of the 
audit committee or the board of trustees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Australia's Phil Coles, one of the 10 new IOC members  
implicated in the Salt Lake case, stepped down from the Sydney 
Olympic organizing committee board, pending an IOC inquiry. He 
denied the Salt Lake report's allegation that he made four visits 
to the United States at Salt Lake organizers' expense. 
</P>
<P>
	--Barbados IOC member Austin Sealy, implicated in the Salt Lake  
report, denied any wrongdoing. Bid records showed $3,000 a month 
passed through a company affiliated with a consultant to Sealy. 
``The bottom line is that I know nothing about any payments,'' he 
said. ``I'm completely in the dark about this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--The Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter reported that Stockholm's  
unsuccessful bid for the 2004 Olympics paid for the medical care of 
IOC members or their relatives on five occasions. The newspaper 
said each of the payments amounted to more than the $150 limit for 
gifts.

<HEADLINE> Tricon Earns $151M in Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Tricon Global Restaurants Inc. earned a  
net $151 million in the fourth quarter of last year, bouncing back 
from a loss a year ago, thanks to strong sales in its Pizza Hut, 
Taco Bell and KFC restaurant chains. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings, which were equivalent to 95 cents a share, compare  
to a loss of $363 million, or $2.39 per share, in the same period a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Both periods included gains and losses from an ongoing program  
to close or refranchise hundreds of underperforming restaurants. 
Without the effect of those sales, the company's earnings rose to 
$87 million in the fourth quarter compared to $44 million a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterly revenues fell to $2.53 billion from $2.79 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Investors, pleased that the company returned to profitability,  
boosted Tricon's shares $4.50, or 8.4 percent, to $58.25 in midday 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales at Pizza Hut and KFC were up 4 percent for the quarter and  
9 percent at Taco Bell, partly on the strength of new products like 
its polular soft-tortilla Gordita, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tricon has closed 600 underperforming stores and sold about  
1,400 others to company-operated units to franchisees. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman Andrall Pearson said the company benefited from the  
introduction of several new products and marketing campaigns, 
including Taco Bell's chihuahua promotions and the animated Colonel 
Sanders at KFC. He also noted successful new products such as the 
Gordita at Taco Bell and The Edge pizza at Pizza Hut. 
</P>
<P>
	The restaurants were spun off from PepsiCo in October 1997.  
</P>
<P>
	For the year, Tricon earned $445 million, or $2.84 per share,  
compared to a loss of $111 million, or 73 cents a share, in 1997. 
Revenues were $8.47 billion, down from $9.69 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Both periods included special charges from various writedowns  
and severance costs. Without the one-time items, Tricon earned $286 
million, or $1.83 a share, in 1998 compared to $217 million, or 
$1.37 a share, in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Study Eyes Incorrect Child Seat Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As many as 85 percent of parents use child car  
seats incorrectly, according to one of the most comprehensive 
studies to date. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Safe Kids Campaign found that a majority of parents  
or caregivers made two or more mistakes in installing and using the 
seats, leaving children dangerously loose in their restraints. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that in the event of a crash, these seemingly small  
mistakes can lead to tragic consequences for children,'' said 
Heather Paul, the group's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
	The 85 percent figure tops the Transportation Department  
estimate last year of 80 percent. The group's study, released 
Thursday, was based on an analysis of more than 17,500 installed 
child seats over the past 17 months. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign said 63 percent of the time, the car seat was not  
secured tightly enough by the seat belt. A parent should not be 
able to move the seat more than 1 inch from side to side after it 
is installed. If a car seat is loose enough, a child can hit his or 
her head as the car seat bounces around in a crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign also found:  
</P>
<P>
	--Thirty-three percent of children were in car seat restraints  
with loose harness straps. This could lead to a child being ejected 
from the car seat in a crash. 
</P>
<P>
	--Twenty percent of children were in child seats whose harness  
straps were not correctly routed. 
</P>
<P>
	In 11 percent of the cases, infants less than a year old or  
weighing less than 20 pounds were observed riding in forward-facing 
car seats instead of rear-facing ones. The neck muscles of children 
under a year old are not sufficiently developed to support their 
heads if they are riding facing forward in a crash, safety experts 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	In less than 1 percent of the cases, infants were riding in  
rear-facing infant seats in the front seat of the car in front of a 
passenger-side air bag. 
</P>
<P>
	Infants in rear-facing infant seats must never be placed in  
front of an air bag because they can be seriously injured or killed 
if the air bag is deployed, safety experts agree. At least 15 
infants have been killed in this way by air bags since 1994, 
according to the Transportation Department.

<HEADLINE> Zach Thomas To Stay With Dolphins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- All-Pro linebacker Zach Thomas has agreed to a  
five-year contract with the Miami Dolphins likely to make him one 
of the game's highest paid at his position, The Associated Press 
learned Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A source close to the negotiations between the Dolphins and  
their leading tackler said the deal was expected to be signed 
Friday. Team officials had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have anything to announce,'' spokesman Harvey Greene  
said Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, a restricted free agent, had received a $1.268 million  
tender from the Dolphins that protected their rights to the 
three-year veteran. Miami could have matched any offer or receive 
first- and third-round draft choices as compensation if Thomas 
signed with another team. 
</P>
<P>
	Agent Drew Rosenhaus had been seeking a deal worth around $5  
million per season, saying at least three teams were prepared to 
make a sizable offer to Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	That would put Thomas' pay at a level comparable to Pittsburgh's  
Levon Kirkland, New England's Ted Johnson, San Diego's Junior Seau 
and Baltimore's Ray Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas was the centerpiece of a Miami defense that was the NFL's  
stingiest, allowing just 265 points this season. He recorded 160 
tackles, leading the Dolphins for the third time in as many 
seasons, and returned two of his three interceptions for 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	The linebacker was not voted to the AFC Pro Bowl squad, but  
received All-Pro honors from a 47-member nationwide panel of sports 
writers and broadcasters.

<HEADLINE> Social Security Battle Renewed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans took fresh aim at President  
Clinton's budget proposal Thursday, questioning whether his Social 
Security rescue plan might increase the financial burdens on future 
generations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The administration's proposal risks saddling our children with  
more debt,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House 
Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders have agreed with Clinton that 62 percent of  
expected future government surpluses should remain untouched while 
lawmakers work out a plan for Social Security's future. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is no agreement on how to bridge the Social Security  
cash shortfall expected when baby boomers retire. 
</P>
<P>
	At a hearing Thursday, Archer argued that if the surpluses were  
simply left alone, the financial benefits to the government would 
snowball in a cycle that would reduce the national debt faster than 
under Clinton's plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The influential Republican also echoed a separate concern that  
some economists share: Clinton's plan would earmark general tax 
revenue to Social Security for the first time ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders, however, have offered no alternative plan to  
shore up the retirement program. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration officials say they fear that without some  
concrete plan, the financial benefits resulting from the nation's 
current prosperity might never reach Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Temptation runs high for Republicans and Democrats alike to use  
any extra money for tax cuts or spending. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's plan ``makes it dramatically more likely that  
the debt reduction will actually take place instead of being 
overturned and spent by future Congresses,'' said White House 
adviser Gene Sperling. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's plan would use about $2 trillion in surpluses to pay  
back public debt -- money borrowed by the government from 
individuals and others who have bought Treasury bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists say reducing that public debt puts government  
finances on a stronger footing because interest payments aren't as 
high and the economy thus gets a boost. 
</P>
<P>
	Counting on those effects as collateral, Clinton would then  
place new IOUs in Social Security's trust fund, representing enough 
money to keep it healthy for about 20 years longer than now 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Clinton has called for bipartisan talks about what else  
might be needed, he has so far proposed no changes in Social 
Security benefits or taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	In effect, Clinton's plan would promise that when the special  
payroll taxes that have traditionally been Social Security's 
exclusive source of money run short -- as is expected in 2032 -- the 
government would make up the difference from general revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans are not alone in questioning that part of Clinton's  
proposal: A blue-ribbon commission two years ago unanimously 
rejected the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission's chairman, Edward Gramlich -- now a member of the  
Federal Reserve Board -- this week warned lawmakers of ``serious 
drawbacks'' to Clinton's plan, including that it could put 
retirees' needs in direct competition with other programs.

<HEADLINE> Owners Lead 4-0 in Arbitration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mark Grudzielanek and Johnny Damon lost their  
salary arbitration cases Thursday, giving owners victories in all 
four hearings this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Grudzielanek, eligible for arbitration for the first time, will  
be paid $1.9 offered by the Los Angeles Dodgers rather than the 
$2.6 million he asked for, arbitrator Nicholas Zumas ruled after 
hearing arguments Wednesday in Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers acquired the infielder from Montreal last July 31,  
and he hit a combined .272 last season with 10 home runs and 62 
RBIs. He made $350,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Damon, an outfielder for the Kansas City Royals who also was  
eligible for the first time, will get $2.1 million instead of $3.2 
million, according to a panel decision by Mort Mitchnick, Roger 
Abrams and Roger Kaplan. 
</P>
<P>
	Damon hit .277 last year with 18 homers, 66 RBIs and 26 steals.  
He made $460,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners also won the first two cases of the year, beating Boston  
outfielder Midre Cummings and Montreal infielder Shane Andrews 
earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle outfielder Butch Huskey, who had been scheduled for a  
hearing Thursday, agreed to a $1.5 million, one-year contract, five 
times his $300,000 salary last year. Boston right-hander John 
Wasdin also settled, agreeing to a $500,000, one-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Huskey, acquired by the Mariners on Dec. 14, hit .252 with 13  
homers and 59 RBIs last season for the New York Mets. In addition 
to his salary, he would get a $50,000 bonus for 580 plate 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	Wasdin, 26, was 6-4 with a 5.25 ERA last season in eight starts  
and 39 relief appearances. He can earn $100,000 in bonuses: $20,000 
for 10 starts, $25,000 each for 15 and 20 starts and $30,000 for 25 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve players remain in arbitration, with hearings scheduled  
through Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	In free agent news, the Philadelphia Phillies have made an offer  
to 40-year-old pitcher Orel Hershiser. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got no indication of where they stood in return,'' general  
manager Ed Wade said . ``We're waiting to hear back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hershiser, who made $3.7 million last year with the San  
Francisco Giants, turned down offers from the Giants and the 
Florida Marlins.

<HEADLINE> Russia Missile System in Bad Shape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States says it is concerned that  
Russia's early warning defense against missile attack appears to be 
deteriorating. 
</P>
<P>
	However, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said  
Wednesday the end of the Cold War has reduced any chance of Russia 
launching missiles based on a defective warning system. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, he said the United States is following up an offer  
President Clinton made at the Moscow summit last September to 
exchange information on missile launches and early warning systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and the Soviet Union mounted early warning  
systems during the Cold War to guard against a surprise missile 
attack. This gave the two sides a chance to prepare for an attack 
and to retaliate if missiles were on their way. 
</P>
<P>
	A defective system would make it harder to sort out information  
and to decide what to do. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post, in a report from Moscow on Wednesday, said  
Russia cannot replenish the array of satellites it needs to monitor 
U.S. missile silos and nuclear-armed submarines. 
</P>
<P>
	For several hours every day, the Post said, Russian military  
commanders cannot see any of the U.S. missile fields nor can they 
monitor the most dangerous threat to their own forces -- U.S. 
Trident submarines submerged in the world's oceans. The report 
quoted unidentified Russian and Western security analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the article, Rubin said U.S. security interests kept  
him from discussing the capabilities of specific Russian systems. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said: ``We are concerned about the potential  
deterioration of Russia's ballistic missile attack warning 
capabilities without referencing any specific systems.''

<HEADLINE> No New Roads in National Forests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration today ordered a  
halt to road construction in more than 33 million acres of national 
forests, a move environmentalists hope will lead to permanent 
protection of vast areas of forest land. 
</P>
<P>
	But the plan, announced by the Agriculture Department, will  
exempt large expanses of old-growth forest in the Northwest and in 
Alaska where road building may continue under previously enacted 
forest management plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are ... calling an official time out, so we can examine the  
science, involve the public and build a road policy for the 21st 
century,'' Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said at a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-month moratorium on road building in large areas of  
roadless forest across the country had been expected since a draft 
plan was unveiled a year ago. The final plan changed little from 
the original proposal, although it added some forests in the 
Southeast, especially in the southern Appalachians. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the moratorium, a prelude to a broader permanent  
forest road plan, would prevent construction of about 360 miles of 
road and block the harvesting of about 200 million board feet of 
lumber, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Forest Service manages 191 million acres of forests and  
more than 400,000 miles of forest roads. It sells about 4 million 
board feet of timber from federal forests annually. 
</P>
<P>
	The moratorium, which has been criticized by the logging  
industry, was expected to prompt mixed reaction from 
environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
	Groups such as the Wilderness Society and Sierra Club have  
criticized the plan because of its broad exemptions. The Sierra 
Club inundated Forest Service officials with 100,000 postcards 
criticizing the moratorium's limits. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a move ``in the right direction,'' said William Meadows,  
president of the Wilderness Society, who praised Forest Service 
chief Michael Dombeck for reversing the agency from policies that 
historically have favored increased road building in forest areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Roads are ``the number one threat to forest health'' and a  
permanent ban on road building must follow and be broadened to 
include all 60 million acres of roadless federal forest, said 
Meadows. ``Eighteen months is not nearly long enough to stave off 
the threat,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The moratorium blocks road building -- mostly logging roads -- in  
about 33 millions acres of federal forests, areas as small as 5,000 
acres. The federal government owns 191 million acres of forest in 
44 states. About 34 million acres are officially designated 
wilderness and must remain roadless. Another 60 million acres are 
roadless without permanent protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists had wanted the moratorium to apply to roadless  
areas as small as 1,000 acres and have criticized exemption of the 
Northwest's old-growth forests and Alaska's Tongass National 
Forest. Together, these exemptions cover more than 15 million acres 
in which new roads may still be built under existing forest plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Forest Service has defended the exemptions of large areas of  
the Northwest because these forests already are under a forest 
management plan to protect the spotted owl. Likewise, the Tongass 
in Alaska has a management plan in place. 
</P>
<P>
	These plans, the agency argues, will adequately protect the  
roadless areas over the next 18 months when a permanent long-term 
strategy on forest roads is expected to be developed. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, the U.S. Forest Service has built an estimated  
440,000 miles of roads in its forests, mostly for logging but also 
for recreation. Environmentalists are concerned if the road 
building continues in the now roadless areas, it will lead to 
further logging and other exploitation. 
</P>
<P>
	With the moratorium ``the process has been started'' to protect  
roadless areas, said Melanie Griffith of the Sierra Club. ``But 
there are still a lot of loopholes.''

<HEADLINE> Pluto Is Again Most Distant Planet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tiny Pluto slips outside the orbit of Neptune  
today to resume its role as the farthest planet from the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	This return to normal comes just days after the littlest planet  
survived an attack that threatened to strip it of its planetary 
status altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	Normally the most distant planet, Pluto has an unusual orbit  
that takes 248 Earth-years to complete one trip around the sun. 
During just 20 of those years, it moves inside Neptune's orbit to 
become the eighth planet instead of the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	Pluto moved inside Neptune's orbit on Feb. 7, 1979, and was on  
course to cross back outside at 5:08 a.m. EST today, scientists at 
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration calculated. 
</P>
<P>
	Pluto will remain the most distant planet for the next 228  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last week, the Paris-based International Astronomical  
Union, the world's leading astronomical organization, reaffirmed 
Pluto's standing as the smallest planet. 
</P>
<P>
	News reports had said Pluto might be demoted to a minor planet,  
or -- worse -- a trans-Neptunian object. 
</P>
<P>
	``No proposal to change the status of Pluto as the ninth planet  
in the solar system has been made by any division, commission or 
working group of the IAU responsible for solar system science,'' 
said the 80-year-old organization, the final authority on 
astronomical matters. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Pluto was crossing Neptune's orbit, there was no  
worry about a collision, NASA said, because the planets were going 
to be far apart at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Pluto was discovered Feb. 18, 1930, by Clyde Tombaugh at Lowell  
Observatory in Flagstaff, Ariz. Its moon, Charon, was found in 
1979. 
</P>
<P>
	With a diameter of 1,430 miles, Pluto is less than half the size  
of any other planet and only two-thirds as big as Earth's moon.

<HEADLINE> Ray Allen Gets $70.9M Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Ray Allen's wits match his wealth, a scary  
combination for agents, who might find themselves missing more 
megadeals across the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	The Milwaukee Bucks' thrifty guard negotiated his own six-year,  
$70.9 million contract extension, then brought in his team of 
low-priced advisors to OK the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	He's got game. And he's got smarts, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Allen, who starred alongside Denzel Washington last year in  
Spike Lee's ``He Got Game,'' signed a deal nearly identical to 
those recently negotiated by agents for rising stars Kobe Bryant, 
Allen Iverson, Shareef Abdur-Rahim and Antoine Walker 
</P>
<P>
	But Allen won't be forking over a 4 percent commission -- or a  
cool $2,836,000 -- to an agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't need somebody skimming millions off the top,'' said  
Allen, who chose instead to pay a team of lawyers -- including 
celebrity lawyer Johnnie Cochran -- a business manager and an 
accountant at an hourly rate of up to $500. 
</P>
<P>
	``When agents see what I'm doing, they'll say, `Well, he's a  
flagship for something that we do not necessarily agree with. It's 
going to take away our livelihood,''' Allen said. ``And I think 
it's something important for this league and for the players, when 
we're smart enough to take care of our own money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allen negotiated directly with team owner Herb Kohl, the senior  
senator from Wisconsin, because the NBA's new labor accord sets 
limits on what players can earn based on years of service. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope it's a concept that all professional athletes and all  
entertainers begin to embrace,'' said Mark Christie, Allen's 
business manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen said Kohl agreed to pay him the maximum salary allowed a  
third-year player by the new collective bargaining agreement: $9 
million to start, with annual raises of 12.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	That made Allen the highest-paid player in team history,  
surpassing the $68.25 million contract that Glenn Robinson received 
as the top pick in the 1994 NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen is not only wealthy, he's wise, Bucks coach George Karl  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Karl contends that agents are superfluous for rookies, who have  
a salary scale, and stars such as Allen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's shown a lot of people that you may not need  
agents,'' Karl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Horsey, Allen's accountant, said his client is at the  
forefront of a movement that could change the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the pioneer. He's the one that set the stage,'' Horsey  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Steinmiller, the Bucks' vice president of business  
operations, said agents are still essential in the bulk of contract 
cases, however. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Ray's case, he is a solid, mature, intelligent  
businessperson himself and he recognizes those qualities in the 
people he put around him, so it worked for him,'' Steinmiller said. 
``He also has a strong family structure that not all athletes are 
blessed with. So I think it really is an individual situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you can put a blanket thing that agents are  
obsolete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allen said he's already been queried about his no-agent approach  
by Minnesota's Sam Mitchell, ``and he said it was real smart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's only smart for me and any other guy who might be in my  
situation who's going to negotiate a new deal with their team to 
maybe think about having a lawyer do it or even yourself,'' Allen 
said. ``The lawyer really might be in it just to be a part of 
negotiations and really for a feather in their cap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His mother said Allen, who was represented by Lee Fentress of  
Advantage International when he entered the league in 1996, isn't 
anti-agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing against agents, but it's not what's best for Ray,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeremiah DeBerry, Allen's lawyer, said agents are necessary only  
for ``middle of the road guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``For the rookies and for the high profile guys who are going to  
get the maximum, certainly this is the way to go,'' DeBerry said. 
``It just makes sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And it saves millions.

<HEADLINE> Nursing Home Backs Medicaid Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nursing home giant that came under fire  
for clearing its homes of older people who rely on Medicaid is 
endorsing legislation meant to clamp down on that sort of practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Vencor Inc., which runs more than 300 homes across the country,  
said it supports legislation to prevent nursing home residents from 
being discharged just because their bills are paid by Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
	``The proposed bill would protect Medicaid residents' rights,''  
said Edward L. Kuntz, chief executive officer of Vencor, in a 
letter to the bill's backers. 
</P>
<P>
	Medicaid payment rates are generally lower than rates for people  
who pay with their own money. Vencor, a $3.1 billion company, has 
touted its plans to Wall Street to replace Medicaid residents with 
those who can pay more. 
</P>
<P>
	The company ran into trouble in Tampa, Fla., when it told 52  
Medicaid residents they would have to leave to make way for a 
renovation project. Critics charged that they were just out to 
replace them with more profitable residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Nursing homes do not have to take Medicaid payments, and federal  
law does not prohibit them from withdrawing from the Medicaid 
program and kicking out people who are part of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Under new legislation that got its first hearing Thursday, a  
nursing home would be forbidden from removing someone who is 
already living there solely because he or she relies on Medicaid. 
And the home would have to notify new residents that it no longer 
accepts Medicaid payments. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they are currently residents, they can't be evicted,'' said  
sponsoring Rep. Michael Bilirakis, R-Fla., chairman of the House 
Commerce health subcommittee. He said he expects the House to 
approve the legislation by spring. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half the people who rely on Medicaid to pay for  
nursing homes entered homes using private money, then depleted 
their assets and went into Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
	While Medicaid generally is thought of as a program for poor  
families and children, two-thirds of elderly nursing home patients 
rely on Medicaid to help pay their care, at an expense to taxpayers 
of $24.2 billion in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Long-term care for older Americans in and out of nursing homes  
accounts for almost a fifth of Medicaid's entire cost. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the legislation, seniors could ``have peace of mind,  
knowing once they are there, they will not be summarily evicted 
just because they are relying on the Medicaid program,'' said Rep. 
Jim Davis, D-Fla., another sponsor.

<HEADLINE> Boston Scientific Cuts 2,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NATICK, Mass. (AP) -- Boston Scientific Corp. plans to cut 2,000  
jobs, or 18 percent of its work force, over the next year as the 
company integrates Schneider Worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes will cost BSX about $62 million, mostly in severance  
and related expenses, the company said in a statement Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	About $36 million of the costs were included on the company's  
books in the purchase price of Schneider. The remaining $26 million 
will be taken as a charge in the fourth quarter. Earnings for 
Boston Scientific are due out later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear whether a total of 2,000 people  
would lose their jobs, or if some of the positions to be eliminated 
are already empty. The company currently has 11,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the company did not immediately return telephone  
messages left by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston Scientific paid $2.1 billion for Schneider Worldwide, a  
former Pfizer Inc. unit that makes devices used to unclog arteries. 
The purchase was announced in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston Scientific is a medical technology firm that develops and  
manufactures diagnostic and therapeutic devices.

<HEADLINE> GM Exec: High Demand May Hurt GM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- If U.S. demand for new cars and trucks remains as  
strong this year as it was in December and January, there's ``not a 
chance'' General Motors Corp. will meet its goal of gaining 32 
percent of the domestic market, GM's North American president said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	While higher demand would normally mean more sales for an  
automaker, GM already is stretched thin on its most popular and 
profitable products: pickups and sport utility vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Production capacity is not the problem, Ronald Zarrella told  
reporters during the Chicago Auto Show media preview: Quite simply, 
GM cannot get enough V-8 engines to meet the robust demand. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's market share last year fell below 30 percent, in part  
because of United Auto Workers' strikes that halted production for 
several weeks last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	It introduced its long-awaited new pickups last fall, but  
inventories still remain far too low. So even if industry sales 
rise, GM can't make any more of its trucks to meet the increased 
demand and those sales will go to other automakers, further 
diluting GM's share. 
</P>
<P>
	Zarrella said GM has an inventory of about 30 days for its  
full-sized pickups; 60 is considered normal. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand in the past two months has been unusually strong, at an  
average annual rate of 16 million units. Americans bought about 
15.6 million vehicles last year. GM's official forecast is for 15 
million to 15.5 million vehicles to be sold in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chevrolet division, meanwhile, is betting demand for the  
2000 Monte Carlo coupe will be higher after it goes on sale next 
fall, despite a declining market for two-door cars. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's volume division unveiled the mid-size car Thursday, a month  
after it displayed the car's sedan version, the 2000 Impala, which 
also goes on sale later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Coupe sales have been down sharply this decade as buyers have  
bought the sport utility vehicles and sedans. In the past few 
years, Ford Motor Co. has stopped producing the Thunderbird and 
Probe coupes. 
</P>
<P>
	But GM executives said they are sticking with the market. Chevy  
expects to sell 70,000 to 80,000 Monte Carlos a year, up from about 
65,000 last year. That compares with plans to sell about 200,000 
Impalas. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's still a couple buyers out there who want an exciting  
brand,'' Chevrolet general manager Kurt Ritter said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new version borrows styling cues from the original Monte  
Carlo of the 1970s, including a long hood, blunt rear end, vertical 
taillight and a return of the ``knight'' emblem. 
</P>
<P>
	But the overall look is less angular and a departure from the  
current Lumina-based Monte Carlo. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevrolet will target the Monte Carlo to drivers in their  
mid-30s and mid-40s. 
</P>
<P>
	The Monte Carlo and Impala also share their chassis and major  
mechanical parts with the Pontiac Grand Prix, Oldsmobile Intrigue 
and Buick Century and Regal. 
</P>
<P>
	Cars will be built at GM's Oshawa, Ontario, plant.  
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Auto Show opens to the public Friday and runs  
through Feb. 21.

	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Philips Electronics reported a  
sharp gain in its 1998 earnings thanks to the sale of its Polygram 
music subsidiary, but profits from its core electronics business 
tumbled on poor sales to Asia and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Philips' net profit for 1998 jumped to $6.8 billion from $2.94  
billion in 1997, boosted by a one-time gain of $5.71 billion from 
its sale of Polygram to Seagram Co. of Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial turmoil in Asia and Brazil and one-time charges at its  
largest electronics division caused a 56 percent drop in operating 
profit to $610 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose slightly to $34.4 billion from $33.52 billion.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Rockets Talking to Johnson's Agent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Free-agent point guard Kevin Johnson is talking  
to the Houston Rockets, but 11 other teams are also interested in 
him, his agent says. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Hiestand told Houston television station KRIV that he has  
spoken with Rockets officials several times. Hiestand said he was 
told by Houston's senior executive vice president, Robert Barr, 
that Johnson would be the final piece to put the Rockets over the 
top. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson is interested in Houston because the team already has  
NBA greats Hakeem Olajuwon, Scottie Pippen and Charles Barkley, 
making them among the top championship contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	``With that criteria in mind, Houston is definitely a top  
contender,'' said Hiestand, whose client has never won an NBA title 
in his 11 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The most the Rockets can offer Johnson is the 10-year veteran  
minimum of $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Barr said it is team policy not to discuss possible moves.  
</P>
<P>
	``I will say (coach) Rudy Tomjanovich is extremely pleased with  
our young guards and the way our basketball team is playing,'' Barr 
said.

<HEADLINE> GOP Pressures INS Commissioner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton continues to have full  
confidence in Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner 
Doris Meissner despite harsh criticism from two Republican 
congressmen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Throughout her tenure, Commissioner Meissner has demonstrated  
a firm commitment to strengthening the INS, to increased service to 
immigrants and to tough, but compassionate, enforcement of this 
nation's immigration laws,'' White House spokeswoman Amy Weiss said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Thursday, Reps. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, and Elton  
Gallegly, R-Calif., said they were so unhappy they wrote a letter 
asking Attorney General Janet Reno to replace Meissner if she does 
not act quickly to improve the detention and deportation of illegal 
aliens. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had the patience of Job,'' Gallegly said. ``We have  
tried to work with Doris Meissner and we have tried and tried and 
tried again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith and Gallegly said they hoped the letter would end  
discussion at the INS of releasing up to 1,500 illegal aliens 
convicted of such crimes as burglary, assault and drug offenses 
because of a shortage of detention space. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he was unmoved by reports that INS field managers  
would break their budgets unless they released some detainees to 
make room for offenders with the most serious criminal records. The 
agency's budget has doubled over the past four years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	INS spokesman Russ Bergeron said no criminal aliens had been  
released and no decision had been made on whether any would be. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are examining how best to meet the mandatory detention  
requirements of the law in the face of inadequate funding for bed 
space to detain these aliens,'' Bergeron said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallegly and Smith said they were also alarmed about the way the  
agency handled announcements that it would suspend some deportation 
rules for Central American illegal aliens fleeing the devastation 
of Hurricane Mitch. Many interpreted the announcement as a blanket 
invitation to come illegally to the United States, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bergeron said the INS has been working with U.S. embassies  
throughout Central America, U.S. and foreign media and the U.S. 
Information Agency to provide information on who qualifies for the 
more lenient rules and who does not. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter also criticized the INS for:  
</P>
<P>
	--Requesting ``only $22.5 million in funding for new detention  
space'' in the administration's budget for next year. Bergeron said 
Congress declined to grant the agency's request for $40 million for 
detention programs this year that might have prevented the current 
shortage. 
</P>
<P>
	--Using up detention space on criminal aliens who could have been  
deported immediately, but remain in the United States ``because of 
INS inefficiency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Not asking for money to hire additional border patrol agents in  
next year's budget even though the 1996 immigration overhaul law 
authorized the hiring of 1,000 new agents a year. Bergeron said 
border patrol staffing has nearly doubled since 1993, and the 
agency plans to hire an additional 1,000 agents this year and 
upgrade equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	--Failing to put more INS agents in local and county jails to  
identify and detain criminal and illegal aliens serving time there. 
Bergeron said Congress took away the $10 million used to help pay 
for the first year of the program.

<HEADLINE> Citigroup Snubs Visa USA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Citigroup Inc., the nation's largest financial  
services company, broke ranks with the banking industry this week 
with plans to issue new credit cards with the ``Citi'' brand name 
on the front and the MasterCard International logo on the back. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was a snub to Visa USA and followed the abrupt  
resignation from Visa's board by Citicorp's chairman, John Reed, 
and its head of consumer operations, Bob Lipp. 
</P>
<P>
	Citibank and Visa had been at odds for weeks over Reed's drive  
to banish the Visa logo to the back of the credit card in order to 
heighten the profile of the Citi name. 
</P>
<P>
	MasterCard, which has seen its share of the credit card market  
decline for more than 20 years, offered to give Citigroup a 
discount in its dues, and agreed to move the MasterCard symbol to 
the back of the card, said David Robertson, president of The Nilson 
Report, an industry newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
	Citigroup ``got a sweetheart deal from MasterCard,'' said  
Robertson. ``That's money that flows right to the bottom line.'' 
Last year Citigroup paid Visa dues totaling between $75 million and 
$100 million, according to an industry source. 
</P>
<P>
	New York-based Citigroup would only confirm that it has resigned  
from the Visa board and made no comment about its future with 
MasterCard. A spokeswoman for MasterCard also would not comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, Citigroup would stop issuing Visa cards and any  
new credit cards would carry only the MasterCard logo. As existing 
Visa cards expire over the next several years, they would be 
replaced with MasterCards. 
</P>
<P>
	Citigroup is already a major issuer of MasterCard credit cards,  
which make up 53 percent of the company's cards. But the Visa cards 
are more heavily used, accounting for 55 percent of Citigroup's 
credit card balances. 
</P>
<P>
	Community banks and credit unions are outraged over Citigroup's  
tough stand on promoting its own name over the credit card brand. 
They fear the move could erode the status of the Visa name and 
shift power in the industry to a handful of large banks that may 
follow Citigroup's lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``We find what John Reed is doing is very destructive to the  
thousands of banks, credit unions and savings an loans that connect 
into the Visa brand and find worldwide acceptance through it,'' 
said Kenneth Guenther, executive vice president of the Independent 
Bankers Association of America. ``I understand John Reed is not 
interested in sharing and wants it all to himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Citigroup is the second-largest credit card issuer in the United  
States with $69.6 billion in consumer credit card balances, 
slightly behind BancOne's First USA subsidiary with $69.9 billion, 
according to the Nilson newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
	MasterCard, desperate to regain some of its lost business, was  
eager to please Citigroup. Purchase, N.Y.-based MasterCard has seen 
its market share fall to 33 percent last year from 38 percent a 
decade ago, while Visa's share has climbed to 67 percent from 62 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But Citigroup is prevented by several contracts from moving much  
of its existing business from Visa to MasterCard. Citigroup 
promised to send its new business to MasterCard, and to switch 
expiring Visa cards with MasterCard credit cards over a three-year 
period, Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Citibank's growth has been lackluster for years,'' he said.  
``Unless they begin to turn that around, that is not necessarily a 
huge change.''

<HEADLINE> Anti-Cancer Drug To Be Tested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Government scientists have finally been able to  
reproduce a scientist's highly publicized results for an 
anti-cancer drug and are now seeking to begin the first human 
tests, The Boston Globe reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The breakthrough using the drug endostatin came only when  
National Cancer Institute scientists conducted the experiment in 
the Children's Hospital laboratory of researcher Dr. Judah Folkman, 
who discovered it and found that it reduced tumors in mice. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, NCI scientists said they could not match Folkman's  
promising test results using a small quantity of the drug Folkman 
sent them. Folkman attributed the failure to the drug's sensitivity 
to handling, storage and the way it's administered. The institute, 
in Frederick, Md., then sent researchers to Folkman's lab in 
November and December. 
</P>
<P>
	``This substantiates the idea that these are technical issues''  
that led to the failure at the NCI laboratory, Dr. Robert Wittes, 
deputy director of the institute, told the Globe. ``Now we will 
move to facilities in Frederick and try to reproduce the results 
down here,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Folkman gained worldwide attention last spring when The New York  
Times reported in a page one story on his findings that endostatin 
and a related drug, angiostatin, shrunk tumors in rats by cutting 
off their blood supply. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Bristol-Myers Squibb pharmaceutical company said  
it would no longer work with a partnering company to develop 
angiostatin, saying the project had not produced a drug that was 
consistently effective. 
</P>
<P>
	The partner, the tiny biotech company EntreMed, said it would  
press ahead with tests on angiostatin, but investors sliced the 
company's value in half Wednesday after Bristol-Myers quit plans to 
pay for human testing. Today, shares of EntreMed rebounded $4.31, 
or 34 percent, to $17.19 in early afternoon trading on the Nasdaq 
Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	EntreMed said it plans to seek Food and Drug Administration  
approval to begin human testing of angiostatin and endostatin later 
this year.

<HEADLINE> Tech Stocks Lead Rise; Dow Up 83.68 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks made a strong recovery from a  
five-session rout this morning, lifting broad-market and then 
blue-chip shares higher. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
83.68 at 9,260.99. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite, which is heavily stocked with technology  
shares, was up 64.89 at 2,374.39. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index 
was up 18.09 at 1,241.64. 
</P>
<P>
	Those were strong advances for the indexes, but as in past days,  
traders said the rally was too narrowly confined to technology 
shares to be trusted yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tech stocks really continue to be the story, and the  
market follows them,'' said Elon Spar, co-head of block trading at 
Credit Suisse First Boston. ``Until you can find another sector to 
take some leadership, I'm not convinced we're going to run a heck 
of a lot 1/8higher 3/8 from here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In particular, new supply being sold into the market in the next  
few weeks will keep the Dow trading between 9,000 and 9,500, Spar 
predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	One sign of conviction to the rally, however, was that advancing  
issues were gaining on decliners. This was a change from previous 
sessions in which declines outnumbered advancers even as indexes 
were moving higher. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon, advancers had a 7-to-4 lead on the New York Stock  
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell Computer was leading the Nasdaq issues higher and was up 4  
at 101. IBM was up 3 1/2 at 172 3/8 on the Big Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank stocks got bit of a lift after Federal Reserve Chairman  
Alan Greenspan, testifying before the the House Banking and 
Financial Services Committee, endorsed a bill that would make it 
easier for financial services companies to combine their 
businesses. Greenspan said the legislation would help the United 
States economy remain dominant. 
</P>
<P>
	Citigroup was up 1 3/16 at 53 9/16, reversing an early loss.  
</P>
<P>
	Retailers were mostly higher after the Commerce Department  
reported an anemic 0.2 percent growth in retail sales in January, 
their smallest gain since last summer. WalMart was up 1 7/8 at 82 
13/16.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Not Worried About Cable Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- AT&AMP;T, which is buying cable giant  
Tele-Communications Inc., isn't worried for now that federal 
regulators might eventually force cable companies to sell access to 
their high-speed lines, its chairman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it poses any threat because I think the outcome  
is going to be that the industry is going to be open,'' said AT&AMP;T's 
chairman Michael Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong said it's in AT&AMP;T's financial interest to get as many  
companies as it can onto its high-speed networks. The company, 
along with the cable industry, opposes government-mandated access 
to cable companies' high-speed lines into their customers' homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, AT&AMP;T and cable companies support voluntary agreements  
for businesses offering competing services to gain access to the 
lines, which allow people to surf the Internet and receive data at 
speeds considerably faster than normal phone lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Bill  
Kennard said the agency would not force AT&AMP;T to sell TCI's 
high-speed cable lines to other companies as a condition of winning 
FCC approval for their merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard said the Internet is still in its infancy and doesn't  
need new regulations at this point. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups, public interest advocates, America Online and  
others had pressed the FCC to require AT&AMP;T to give other companies 
access to TCI's lines to offer competing services. 
</P>
<P>
	Those groups have pressed for the same mandatory access  
requirements to apply to all cable companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the FCC declined to open a proceeding that would  
force all cable companies to share their lines with rivals. But the 
agency said it would monitor the situation to make sure cable 
companies don't freeze out their rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Through its merger with TCI and a separate agreement with Time  
Warner, AT&AMP;T will have access to cable lines covering 40 percent of 
U.S. households. Armstrong said more cable agreements are needed to 
boost coverage to AT&AMP;T's goal of 60 to 70 percent of households. 
</P>
<P>
	``So ahead of us there has to be more deals, if you would, with  
cable companies,'' Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Armstrong renewed his call for the FCC to make a  
deep cut -- $10 billion -- in government mandated fees that 
long-distance companies pay local phone companies to connect calls. 
</P>
<P>
	A portion of the fee helps make local phone service affordable  
for the poor and people living in rural and expensive-to-serve 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The fees, which are typically passed along to long-distance  
customers, have been going down and now make up about 30 cents of 
every $1 of long-distance charges. 
</P>
<P>
	United States Telephone Association President Roy Neel said  
Armstrong's idea, if implemented by the FCC, would make local rates 
``go through the ceiling'' and would put an end to affordable local 
phone service.

<HEADLINE> Generic Drug Maker Schein Sees Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLORHAM PARK, N.J. (AP) -- Generic drug maker Schein  
Pharmaceutical, ailing since the government last fall shut down its 
most lucrative plant because of quality problems, on Thursday 
reported losses for the fourth quarter and all of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding a fourth-quarter restructuring charge, Schein said it  
earned $1.49 million, or 5 cents per share, beating Wall Street 
estimates by two cents. A year ago, Schein earned $7.38 million, or 
26 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	However, including the restructuring charge, the company lost  
$1.11 million, or 3 cents per share, in the quarter, while 
operating income was $2.9 million, about one-sixth the amount of 
the earlier period. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues fell 10.8 percent in the fourth quarter, from $136.34  
million a year ago to $121.66 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Schein said it took after-tax charges of $132 million in the  
third quarter and $3 million in the fourth quarter due to the Food 
and Drug Administration's September order halting production at and 
shipments from subsidiary Steris Laboratories of Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the Sept. 10 raid at Steris by U.S. marshals and FDA  
officials, the plant permanently laid off 350 of its 670 employees 
and has been barred from making or shipping all but one drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Schein said it lost $118.03 million, or $3.77 per share, for all  
of 1998, compared with a profit of $11.1 million, or 39 cents a 
share, in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the one-time charges, the company said it earned $18.6  
million, or 59 cents a share, in 1998. Revenues for the year were 
up 6.7 percent to $523.2 million from $490.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Sperber, chairman and chief executive officer, said  
performance was helped by higher-than-expected sales of two new 
generic drugs -- an anti-inflammatory medicine and a drug for 
attention deficit disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	Schein, based in Florham Park, also has plants in Cherry Hill,  
Puerto Rico, Carmel, N.Y., and Danbury, Ct. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Schein closed up 37 1/2 cents to $11 in trading on the  
New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> IOC: Sponsors Are Still Supportive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The Olympics' corporate sponsors remain supportive  
despite the corruption scandal that has scarred the games' image, 
the IOC's sponsorship chief said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Pound, the IOC vice president who negotiates key television  
and marketing deals, said international sponsors endorse the IOC's 
efforts to clean house following the Salt Lake City bribery case. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sponsors have been very supportive of the efforts we've  
been making to date to clean up this problem,'' Pound said in a 
conference call from New York. ``There is nobody that has 
withdrawn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound, who was meeting with sponsors in New York, said there was  
no indication that corporations were considering pulling out. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sponsor group has been very good, proper and  
businesslike,'' he said. ``They say, `We understand you have 
problems, we appreciate what you are doing to clean up and we are 
supportive of your efforts to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the only outspoken critic among the sponsors has been  
David D'Alessandro, president of John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro announced this week that his company was canceling  
negotiations with NBC for $20 million in ads to protest the IOC's 
handling of the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	John Hancock is part of the IOC's TOP program, a group of 11  
international sponsors who pay around $50 million each for 
exclusive rights to use the five-ring Olympic logo in ads. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro said John Hancock will also remove the Olympic  
rings from its annual report, company stationery and certain 
venues. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound downplayed Hancock's protest.  
</P>
<P>
	``John Hancock has postponed its television discussions, which  
is an add-on to its sponsorship,'' he said. ``I have spoken with 
Mr. D'Alessandro. There is no question of abandoning or thinking of 
abandoning the Olympic sponsorship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate interview with The Associated Press in New York,  
Pound said critics should wait for the outcome of a special IOC 
meeting in March, called to deal just with the corruption issue, 
before voicing concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our response, and I've discussed it with Dave, is, `Look. We  
have the message. We had the message a while ago,''' Pound said. 
```We are dealing with this. And, please, let us get on with the 
solution to this and you can judge the solution when we get to 
mid-March. And if you don't think we've done it right when all the 
smoke is cleared, then, please, make your point then.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said in the conference call that TV ad sales in North  
America and Australia are ``way ahead of schedule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He described D'Alessandro as ``the most positive'' of Olympic  
sponsors in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	``John Hancock has made fabulous use of that sponsorship for the  
betterment of the business,'' Pound said. ``I think he would like 
very much to continue it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said D'Alessandro believes he is helping the IOC by  
keeping up pressure on the committee to deal with the crisis. Pound 
said that's not necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are saying that even without that pressure we would be  
doing the same thing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound also countered D'Alessandro's suggestion that IOC  
president Juan Antonio Samaranch has failed to handle the crisis 
and may be near the end of his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a problem (Samaranch) acknowledges has arisen on his  
watch and has become a serious problem,'' Pound said. ``He wants to 
make sure action is taken to clean up and whatever changes are 
necessary to take us into the future are done under his leadership. 
I think that's important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For now, Pound said, Olympic sponsorship ``is still a fabulous  
investment.''

<HEADLINE> House Managers Blame Public Opinion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Resigned to losing their case, the House  
prosecutors say public opinion won out over their case that 
President Clinton committed high crimes and misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baffled'' by polls that showed Americans consistently opposed  
Clinton's removal no matter what evidence the prosecution team 
presented, lead manager Rep. Henry Hyde said he had held out hope 
for a sea change. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did feel that if we could get the story out in a coherent  
fashion, the public might be informed and a change in the public's 
mind would reach the senators,'' Hyde said in an interview 
Wednesday as the Senate moved through its second day of closed 
deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's essential, for impeachment to prevail, to have bipartisan  
support. We never had it,'' the House Judiciary Committee chairman 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. agreed: ``The public opinion polls  
have been the hurdle for us. That is tough, to remove a popular 
president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In more than three weeks of arguments before 100 silent  
senators, the managers insisted that Clinton committed perjury 
before a grand jury and obstructed justice in his efforts to cover 
up his affair with Monica Lewinsky. And they argued strongly that 
the offenses met the constitutional standards for conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	But in poll after poll, constituents of the senator-jurors  
overwhelmingly opposed Clinton's removal. Surveys indicated that 
two-thirds of Americans took this stance as the trial wound down. 
</P>
<P>
	As the 67 votes needed for Clinton's removal moved farther out  
of reach, the president's approval rating hovered consistently 
above 60 percent. Approval for the Republicans' handling of the 
case never topped 40 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	And though impeachment duty endeared the prosecutors to  
conservatives, evidence began to mount that some of them were 
suffering back home. 
</P>
<P>
	A Chicago Tribune poll suggested that three months after Hyde  
won easy re-election to his Illinois House seat, one-third of the 
voters in his conservative district said they had a lower opinion 
of him as a result of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jim Rogan, R-Calif., faced a difficult re-election even  
before he was appointed to the impeachment team. Though he outspent 
his Democratic opponent 2-1, Rogan was elected to his second House 
term last year with only 50.2 percent of the vote. Clinton won 
Rogan's Pasadena-area district by 49 percent in 1996, compared with 
41 percent for Republican nominee Bob Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Steve Chabot of Ohio is in a similar situation, embarking  
on the impeachment trial after he overcame a tight race to win 
re-election with 53 percent of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservatives predict voters will consider impeachment old news  
by the time the next Election Day rolls around. The managers point 
out that they only did the job the Constitution required after the 
House approved impeachment articles. And Hyde framed the question 
of political fallout when he told the Senate that ``upholding the 
rule of law'' was worth losing one's congressional seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Several managers lamented the Senate's restrictive trial rules.  
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly the procedures that we adopted in a bipartisan fashion  
were difficult,'' said sophomore Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., whose 
Fayetteville-area district has sent Republicans to Congress in 
every election since 1966. Clinton won the district by 1 percentage 
point in 1992 and then lost it by 1 percentage point in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Charles Canady of Florida no longer worries about  
re-election because he has limited himself to eight years in the 
House, a period that expires next year. 
</P>
<P>
	He said of the trial, ``The basic facts of the case were the  
same'' as they were when Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr 
delivered his report to Congress last September. 
</P>
<P>
	With defeat imminent, the prosecutors returned to the House this  
week visibly relieved to be considering such normal legislative 
matters as federal spending and trade. 
</P>
<P>
	A few, such as Canady, went upstairs to the Rules Committee on  
Wednesday, where Chairman David Drier was holding an ice cream 
social. Even sweeter, said some of the managers, were the hearty 
backslaps and words of support they got from Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone understands that this was a tough job,'' Rogan said.

<HEADLINE> House Waives Paperwork Penalties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House agreed Thursday to waive penalties  
for small businesses that inadvertently violate federal paperwork 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters said the bill would make it easier to cope with  
federal red tape. The White House, saying the bill could put public 
health and safety at risk, threatened a veto. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, which passed 274-151, requires federal agencies to  
suspend civil fines on small businesses for six months unless an 
agency determines that a first-time violation could harm public 
health or safety, involve criminal activity or break tax laws. 
</P>
<P>
	It also requires federal agencies to create a hotline for small  
businesses that have questions on completing federal paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., the legislation's chief sponsor,  
said businesses spent 7 billion man-hours last year filling out 
federal paperwork. ``There are good law-abiding citizens who are 
trying to do their job,'' he said. ``But sometimes they just don't 
get it right, and then the agencies come in and play `Gotcha.''' 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the administration retorted that current law  
already requires agencies to help first-time small business 
violators who make good-faith efforts to comply. The primary 
beneficiaries of McIntosh's bill ``would appear to be those who do 
not act in good faith,'' the White House said. 
</P>
<P>
	It said the president would be advised to veto the bill because  
it could ``seriously hamper agencies' ability to ensure safety, 
protect the environment (and) detect criminal activity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just not happening,'' Giaovanni Coratolo, director of  
small business policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said of 
current agency efforts to help innocent violators comply. ``There 
has to be some escape valve or some buffer in a minor paperwork 
violation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McIntosh sought to answer some of the administration's protests  
with an amendment stating that actions with the potential to cause 
serious harm to the public interest would not be eligible for the 
penalty waiver. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, who led the opposition, said  
that didn't go far enough toward resolving the main problem. The 
waiver, he said, essentially means that ``businesses would have one 
get-out-of-jail-free card, which they can use even when they have 
willfully and maliciously violated the law.'' 
</P>

	Senate Vote on Clinton Is Friday  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The fate of President Clinton is to be decided  
by the Senate at midday on Friday in his impeachment trial. The 
president seems certain to remain in office. Olympia Snowe of Maine 
today became the fourth Republican senator to vow to vote to acquit 
on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. A Senate censure 
of the president appears unlikely because of GOP opposition. But 
Democrats said that failing passage of a censure, they would draft 
their own condemnation.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Linda Tripp, whose secret tape recordings

again'' and expose a relationship in which President Clinton 
``abused, used, discarded'' former White House intern Monica 
Lewinsky. In her first television interview since the scandal broke 
more than a year ago, Mrs. Tripp told NBC that ``the public has no 
clue ... absolutely no idea what Monica endured. ... the 
histrionics, the hysteria, the throwing of lamps, the damage to 
herself'' and that Clinton ``emotionally abused Monica.''

	NEW YORK (AP) -- A U.S. trial jury found several gun makers  
liable today in three New York City-area shootings because of 
negligent marketing practices. The case could set a precedent for 
cities trying to recoup the costs of gun violence. The federal jury 
ordered that the only survivor, Steven Fox, 19, be paid $560,000. 
Defendants were accused of dumping handguns onto the market,''

	COOS BAY, Ore. (AP) -- Demolitions experts set off a series of  
explosives tonight, lighting a cargo ship on fire in an attempt to 
save Oregon's beaches from a disastrous oil spill. Flames jumped 
hundreds of feet from the 639-foot New Carissa as smoke drifted up 
the coastline. The Japanese-owned freighter ran aground Feb. 4 
about 150 yards offshore with nearly 400,000 gallons of tarlike 
bunker oil aboard. It began leaking Monday as pounding waves

military planes violate ``no-fly'' zones, the Pentagon said. The 
attacks occurred in both the northern and southern no-fly zones. In 
the north, U.S. fighter jets were targeted by radar in each 
incident. In the south, Air Force and Navy fighter jets struck two 
anti-aircraft missile sites, radar and equipment after a pair of 
Iraqi MiG-23s flew into the no-fly zone. U.S. pilots returned

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate is set for climactic noontime votes  
tomorrow at the impeachment trial of President Clinton. As private 
deliberations neared an end, more senators today made public their 
intentions for the roll call votes on perjury and obstruction of 
justice, dividing largely along party lines. Clinton seems certain

<HEADLINE> Unabomber Lands a Book Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Unabomber has landed a book deal.  
</P>
<P>
	Theodore J. Kaczynski plans to tell his life story in a book to  
be released this spring and proceeds will go to his victims' 
families, a publisher announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Beau Friedlander, publisher of Context Media, says ``Truth  
Versus Lies'' is Kaczynski's ``attempt to tell the other side of a 
one-sided tale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kaczynski is serving a life sentence for 16 bomb attacks that  
killed three people and wounded 29. He pleaded guilty last year in 
Sacramento, Calif., to avoid the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of that deal, he also agreed to turn over any future  
earnings to the victims' families. He is receiving no advance 
payment for the book. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaczynski failed last year to shop the book to more established  
New York publishers, including Simon &AMP; Schuster. That's when 
Friedlander said he wrote to the former Berkeley mathematics 
professor in prison and expressed interest. 
</P>
<P>
	He received a 548-page manuscript last fall and plans to publish  
the book in late May or June. He declined to release an advance 
copy, saying he was still shopping it for serialization by a 
magazine or newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaczynski's previous writing project was a 35,000-word  
anti-technology manifesto published by The New York Times and The 
Washington Post in September 1995. His brother, David, noticed 
similarities to Kaczynski's writings and notified authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	David Kaczynski got a $1 million government reward and has set  
up a fund to distribute about $500,000 to victims of crimes 
committed by paranoid schizophrenics. His brother has been 
diagnosed as a schizophrenic. 
</P>
<P>
	Friedlander said Kaczynski ``is earnest about discovering his  
brother's true motivations for turning him over to the FBI. 
Kaczynski spares no details, even when they show him in a less 
favorable light.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Context Media also is releasing a book this spring by Michael  
Mello, a Vermont law professor who has exchanged letters with 
Kaczynski since July. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaczynski believes he was unfairly coerced into pleading guilty  
and has hired a new lawyer to help him win a second trial, 
according to Mello.

<HEADLINE> Rodriguez Back After Heart Attack  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The sword dance whenever he makes an important putt and the  
constant banter with the gallery are still part of the routine. Chi 
Chi Rodriguez is one of the most engaging personalities in golf, 
and not even a heart attack can get in the way of that. 
</P>
<P>
	The only changes in store for Rodriguez, who returns to the  
Senior PGA Tour this week in the American Express Invitational in 
Sarasota, Fla., are off the course. 
</P>
<P>
	No more cigarettes, which he gave up 16 months ago. A diet that  
allows him only about 3 ounces of red meat each week. And a new 
message for anyone who will listen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't be stubborn,'' Rodriguez said. ``Whenever you have pain  
or dizzy spells, get a stress test. Go see a doctor. Because the 
heart attack that I had cold have been prevented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez is back on the tour for for the first time since a  
heart attack Oct. 13, which he says probably would have killed him 
if not for his brother insisting he go to a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez was working out that Tuesday morning before a practice  
round in the Raley's Gold Rush Classic. He routinely went 30 
minutes at 12 mph on the stationary bicycle, and he was playing 
well. A month earlier, his tie for fifth in the Comfort Classic was 
his best tournament of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	But when he got on the bike, he noticed something wrong.  
</P>
<P>
	is heart started burning.  
</P>
<P>
	``I had to stop because my stomach was killing me,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He took some antacid, got back on the bike and had to stop again  
after five minutes when he found it even more difficult to breathe 
and swallow. After a big breakfast -- Rodriguez loves food about as 
much as golf -- he finally agreed to see a doctor and couldn't 
believe what he heard. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Rodriguez, you're having a heart attack right now,'' the  
doctor told him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It scared me for the first time,'' Rodriguez said. ``Jim  
Anderson (his pilot) drove me to the hospital and a team of doctors 
were waiting to operate. If I had waited another 10 minutes, the 
doctor said I would have needed a heart transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	``They call it the widow-maker,'' he said. ``About 50 percent of  
the people who get this kind of heart attack die. So, I beat the 
odds pretty good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez has been doing that all his life. He learned the game  
in Puerto Rico by hitting tin cans with a guava tree stick, then 
worked as a caddie before joining the U.S. Army at 19. He joined 
the PGA Tour in 1960 and won eight times during his 21-year career, 
playing on one Ryder Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
	He left his mark on golf through his Chi Chi Rodriguez  
Foundation, which has raised more than $5 million, and on the 
Senior Tour, where he has become one of its most popular players 
even though he hasn't won since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would be a big void if he were gone,'' Larry Nelson said  
Thursday from the TPC at Prestancia. ``Last year, we missed him 
while he was gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez plans to play in only 18 tournaments this year as he  
slowly works himself into shape. He felt strong enough to play 27 
holes two weeks ago, but doesn't want to push it. He says he will 
treat golf even less seriously now, although he is very serious 
about his eating habits. 
</P>
<P>
	``My grandparents on both sides lived to be 100, and I figured I  
would live to be 100 without worrying about anything,'' Rodriguez 
said. ``But I was eating too much of the wrong stuff. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tell you what,'' he said. ``If you've got a good car, you  
better put good gas in it or you'll ruin it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez has lost 17 pounds and feels better than he has in  
years. His doctors told him the heart attack probably had been in 
the makings for as many as four years, and Rodriguez is thankful to 
have a chance to keep playing. 
</P>
<P>
	``In bed when I was almost dead, I found out about life,'' he  
said. ``Money doesn't mean anything. Your health is everything. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rodriguez made one deathbed deal that he now finds hard to  
keep. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I ask God to do is to play golf with my friends. I  
couldn't care less about competing,'' he said. ``But now that I'm 
feeling better, I want to compete again.''

<HEADLINE> Mellon Bequeaths $450M, Paintings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Philanthropist Paul Mellon has bequeathed the  
largest gift ever to the National Gallery of Art -- $75 million and 
a collection of more than 100 works of art, including paintings by 
Vincent van Gogh, Claude Monet and Winslow Homer. 
</P>
<P>
	The donations by Mellon, who died Feb. 1 at the age of 91, are  
listed in a will filed Wednesday in Warrenton, Va., gallery 
officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Mellon had already given more than 900 works to the museum and  
had made possible its East Building, an expansion of the museum 
founded by his father, banker-industrialist Andrew W. Mellon. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're outstanding paintings,'' gallery spokeswoman Deborah  
Ziska said today. ``He was extremely meticulous, thoughtful and 
generous,'' she said of Mellon. 
</P>
<P>
	The gifts include two oils by van Gogh: ``Still Life of Oranges  
and Lemons with Blue Gloves'' and ``Green Wheat Fields, Auvers.'' 
The latter, which hung in Mellon's Virginia home, will be the 
gallery's first van Gogh from that period in the artist's life, 
Ziska said. 
</P>
<P>
	The gift also includes one of Homer's most famous paintings,  
``Dad's Coming,'' as well as works by American painters John 
Frederick Peto and Raphaelle Peale. 
</P>
<P>
	The gallery also will receive 13 paintings by the pointillist  
Georges Seurat, three by Edouard Manet and 10 by Pierre Bonnard. 
Other French paintings by Paul Cezanne, Georges Braque, Eugene 
Delacroix, Monet and Pierre Auguste Renoir are also part of the 
bequest. 
</P>
<P>
	Mellon designated that the $75 million gift go for specific  
purposes at the gallery, including acquisitions, education, 
archives and the visual arts, Ziska said. 
</P>
<P>
	The paintings will remain with Mellon's widow, Rachel Lambert  
Lloyd, until her death. She was left $110 million in the will. And 
Mellon also left her some of his most-famous abstract American 
works, by artists such as Mark Rothko and Richard Diebenkorn. 
</P>
<P>
	Other institutions also received large gifts from Mellon's will  
-- whose cash bequests alone exceeded $450 million, The Washington 
Post reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	He left $75 million and more than 130 pictures to the Center for  
British Art at Yale University, which he established, on the 
condition that the museum not charge admission. 
</P>
<P>
	To the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond, he left $10  
million and more than 50 pictures, including van Gogh's ``Daisies, 
Arles,'' a Paul Gauguin still life and a Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh was left $20 million;  
his prep school, Choate Rosemary Hall in Connecticut, $10 million; 
Cambridge University, $8 million, and St. John's College in 
Annapolis, Md., $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Other institutions receiving $5 million gifts: the Thomas  
Jefferson Memorial Foundation, Clare College at Cambridge, London's 
Royal Academy of Arts, the Virginia Historical Society, the Yale 
Art Gallery, the National Trust for Historic Preservation and the 
Washington Institute for Psychoanalysis. 
</P>
<P>
	Mellon, who was in the cavalry in World War II, left $1.5  
million to the U.S. Cavalry Museum in Fort Riley, Kan. He also left 
$1 million to his Upperville church. His retired employees 
receiving pensions were left a sum equal to 36 times their monthly 
pensions.

<P>
	Like many chemicals now being tested, it also seems to block  
HIV, the AIDS virus. But the extra cervical-cancer protection has 
researchers intrigued, and the National Institutes of Health 
cautiously hopes that first-stage testing in women could begin 
later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're excited about the broad-spectrum nature,'' said Dr.  
Penny Hitchcock, NIH's microbicide chief. The HPV protection is 
particularly intriguing because ``it's been a lot harder for us to 
find anything that works with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But we're cautious,'' she stressed, because researchers have  
lots of work -- including turning the ingredient into a usable 
vaginal gel -- before initial testing in women could begin. 
</P>
<P>
	The work is important because 5,000 American women and 250,000  
women worldwide die from cervical cancer every year. HPV is thought 
to be the most common sexually transmitted infection. It is often 
without symptoms, but can cause genital warts as well as lead to 
cervical cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you could eliminate (HPV), you could potentially prevent  
all those cancers,'' said Penn State microbiologist Mary K. Howett, 
who discovered the action of sodium dodecyl sulfate, or SDS. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, HIV is increasing rapidly among women worldwide.  
</P>
<P>
	Microbicides are gels or films that women would insert into the  
vagina before sex to protect against sexually transmitted diseases. 
Currently, women's only protection is condom use. 
</P>
<P>
	But so far, no microbicides have panned out. A study just found  
that the popular spermicide nonoxynol-9, long thought the best hope 
for an anti-HIV gel, doesn't protect after all. Scientists now are 
studying whether other spermicides or chemicals could work instead. 
</P>
<P>
	But no experimental microbicides have shown any effect against  
HPV, the cervical cancer virus. 
</P>
<P>
	In the February journal Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy,  
Howett reported that in test-tube studies, SDS inactivated both the 
AIDS and herpes viruses. Like other experimental microbicides, SDS 
is a detergent that dissolves the fatty coating that holds those 
viruses together. 
</P>
<P>
	But the cervical cancer virus is coated with tightly packed  
proteins that detergents can't dissolve. SDS, however, also is a 
``denaturing'' agent that picked those proteins apart, Howett said. 
</P>
<P>
	After it worked in test tubes, she injected human cells with the  
cancer virus or with SDS-treated virus and then implanted those 
cells inside mice. The treated human cells grew normally with no 
evidence of HPV infection. The untreated cells grew into genital 
warts. 
</P>
<P>
	SDS is very safe, interacting with people's vulnerable mucosal  
tissues every day as they brush their teeth or shampoo. So Howett 
believes it would be equally gentle as a vaginal microbicide, 
something the first tests will try to determine.

	American Drops Nearly 1,100 Flights  
</P>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- More than half of American Airlines' flights were  
grounded today as the firm's problems with disgruntled pilots grew 
despite a judge's back-to-work order. Passengers fumed and fretted 
as the nation's second-largest airline resumed contract talks with 
the pilots' union. The airline said separately it was returning to 
court in Dallas to ask to ask U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall to 
hold the Allied Pilots Association in contempt. More than 1,170 of 
the airline's 2,250 daily flights were grounded because of a lack 
of pilots, according to AMR Corp., the parent of American. That's 
up from the 990 flights canceled yesterday and the most since waves 
of pilots began calling in sick. More than 380,000 travelers have 
been stranded across the country and 3,800 flights canceled since 
Saturday.

	Greenspan Favors GOP Bank Proposal  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan waded  
into this year's debate on overhauling the nation's financial 
services laws today, brushing aside concerns that encouraging the 
creation of one-stop shopping would bring a dangerous concentration 
of economic power. At the same time, he extended his disagreement 
with the Clinton administration over the best approach to take on 
banks, brokerage firms and insurance companies. At a House Banking 
Committee hearing, Greenspan endorsed a bill proposed by committee 
Chairman Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, that would lift the barriers and 
give the Fed more power over new financial activities. A Demcoratic 
proposal would give the treasury secretary more power over such 
financial activities.

	Retail Sales Gain in January  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Post-holiday discounts drew Americans to  
department stores and clothing shops in January, helping to produce 
a modest 0.2 gain in retail sales after a big increase the month 
before. The increase reported today by the Commerce Department, to 
a seasonally adjusted $232 billion, was in line with economists' 
expectations. It followed a large 1 percent gain in December and 
dovetailed with their belief that robust economic growth at the end 
of 1998 is carrying over into early 1999.

in the Nasdaq composite and pushing other market indexes sharply 
higher. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 186.15 at 
9,363.46, the day's high. The Nasdaq composite, which is heavily 
stocked with technology shares, was up 95.97 at 2,405.47. The 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 30.15 at 1,253.69. Those were 
strong advances for the indexes, but as in past days, some traders

	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- MCI WorldCom posted strong profits in the  
final months of 1998, quadrupling its revenues in the first full 
quarter since WorldCom acquired MCI to form the nation's No. 2 
long-distance company. The company reported today that it earned 
$442 million, or 23 cents per share, in the fourth quarter, edging 
past most Wall Street forecasts. The results include a $14 million 
profit from a minority stake bought last summer in the Brazilian 
telephone company Embratel Participacoes. In the fourth quarter of 
1997, when WorldCom and MCI Communications had not yet merged, the 
companies posted a combined loss of $313 million, or 18 cents per

<HEADLINE> Senate Resumes Deliberations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Poised to acquit President Clinton, senators  
returned today to their secret deliberations at the impeachment 
trial with the lone remaining drama centering on whether even a 
simple majority will vote for his conviction and removal from 
office. A vote was expected Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Majority Leader Trent Lott said 37 senators had yet to speak and  
his hopes for a vote today had dimmed. ``I don't think that is 
going to be possible at this time,'' he told senators before the 
sergeant-at-arms closed the chamber doors for the debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``On or about noon tomorrow, this will come to a final vote,''  
Paul Coverdell of Georgia said after attending a lunch break 
meeting with other Republican senators. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's defenders were already looking ahead to life  
after impeachment. White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said 
Clinton would campaign vigorously to return the Congress that 
impeached him to Democratic hands in 2000 but wouldn't specifically 
target the 13 GOP House managers who prosecuted him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't think of a worse or more dumb strategy than going  
after people based on whether they were a House manager or not. ... 
I think we're a little bit smarter than that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott blasted any White House talk of defeating Republicans on  
the eve of the vote. ``It is deeply troubling that the president 
views closure of this constitutional process as an opportunity for 
revenge,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	With Republican hopes for a 67-vote conviction margin now just a  
distant memory, attention turned to the struggle for a mere 
majority -- a legally empty result that nevertheless would offer 
rebuffed House prosecutors a symbolic achievement for their uphill 
work. Three Republicans have announced they will vote to acquit 
Clinton on both charges. Others plan to vote against the perjury 
charge but for a separate article of impeachment alleging 
obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Republicans came forward today to announce they would vote  
to convict Clinton even though political polls show Americans 
overwhelmingly oppose the president's removal. ``I refuse to say 
that high political polls and soaring Wall Street indexes give 
license to those in high places who act in low and illegal ways,'' 
Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., said. 
</P>
<P>
	The obstruction article has been considered the stronger of two  
charges in impeachment trial deliberations that entered their third 
day today. Numerous senators have predicted the perjury article 
against Clinton would not achieve a majority. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Republicans said Wednesday they will not vote to convict  
Clinton. If three more do so and all 45 Democrats vote to acquit, 
the articles would fall short of a majority. Opinion polls have 
shown consistently that about two-thirds of the public think 
Clinton shouldn't be convicted and removed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't be surprised if others would make a similar  
announcement -- how many I don't know,'' Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., 
said of anti-conviction Republicans. Mack did not announce his 
position. 
</P>
<P>
	If acquitted, there is a chance that Clinton would face no  
formal rebuke by the Senate. A Democratic initiative to censure 
Clinton struggled for survival under Republican resistance. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said that if GOP leaders prevent  
a censure vote, supporters might simply draft a declaration 
condemning the president's behavior and circulate it for senators 
to sign. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's session spanned eight hours with several breaks  
along the way. More than 30 senators spoke, with most taking the 
maximum 15 minutes allotted and some reminded by Chief Justice 
William Rehnquist's gavel that time had expired. The first day of 
deliberations on Tuesday covered a period of slightly more than 
four hours. 
</P>
<P>
	While the transcript of the deliberations will remain secret  
unless the Senate changes its mind later, some senators have read 
to reporters the remarks they prepared for the closed session. 
</P>
<P>
	Moderate Republicans James Jeffords of Vermont, Arlen Specter of  
Pennsylvania and John Chafee of Rhode Island announced their 
opposition to conviction on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffords told reporters, ``The pressure is coming on to get a  
majority.'' But a spokesman for Lott said the leadership had not 
tried to line up votes for conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, R-Miss., issued a statement at mid-afternoon declaring  
that the evidence ``shows that the president has committed perjury 
and obstructed justice. The only question left is, will the Senate 
vote to find him guilty of committing these high crimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's actions to conceal his extramarital affair with Monica  
Lewinsky were widely condemned by Democrats and Republicans alike, 
including those opposing conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffords said Clinton ``gave misleading statements ... did  
obstruct justice, but his actions in this case do not reach the 
high standard of impeachment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Specter told reporters he couldn't bring himself to vote for  
acquittal when the roll is called, but rather would declare the 
allegations were ``not proved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chafee said that despite Clinton's ``reckless, tawdry  
behavior,'' he concluded that House prosecutors presented 
``circumstantial evidence'' that was ``rebutted by direct evidence 
or by confusion.''

<HEADLINE> Tech Shares Lead Rise; Dow Up 103.25 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks bounced back today from a  
five-session knockout and pushed major market indexes sharply 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 103.25 at 9,280.56. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite, which is heavily stocked with technology  
shares, was up 72.56 at 2,382.06. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index 
was up 19.77 at 1,243.32. 
</P>
<P>
	Those were strong advances for the indexes, but as in past days,  
traders said the rally was too narrowly confined to technology 
shares to be trusted yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tech stocks really continue to be the story, and the  
market follows them,'' said Elon Spar, co-head of block trading at 
Credit Suisse First Boston. ``Until you can find another sector to 
take some leadership, I'm not convinced we're going to run a heck 
of a lot higher from here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Tom Gallagher, senior stock trader at Oppenheimer &AMP; Co.,  
``It's a sloppy rally with more new lows than new highs, which is 
typical of late, and the breadth is not particularly great again. 
It's just everybody going after the same handful of stocks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advancers had a 7-to-5 lead on the New York Stock Exchange.  
Volume was 632 million shares, up from Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally in technology shares was led by Lycos, which was up 15  
1/16 at 102 11/32 on speculation that the Internet portal company's 
merger with USA Networks Inc.'s electronic retailing operations and 
Ticketmaster Online Citysearch Inc. CMGI Inc., which owns 20 
percent of Lycos, said it will not support the proposed merger at 
Lycos' Wednesday closing price of 87 1/4. Lycos had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
	he reports lifted shares of CMGI 18 1/8 at 110 1/16, and  
Ticketmaster 3 5/8 to 40 3/4. USA Network's shares were up 1/8 at 39 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell Computer was leading the Nasdaq issues higher and was up 4  
at 101. IBM was up 3 1/2 at 100 1/2 on the Big Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank stocks rose after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan,  
testifying before the the House Banking and Financial Services 
Committee, endorsed a bill that would make it easier for financial 
services companies to combine their businesses. Greenspan said the 
legislation would help the United States economy remain dominant. 
</P>
<P>
	Citigroup was up 1 5/8 at 53 15/16, reversing an early loss.  
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Federated Department Stores fell after the company  
said it will acquire catalog retailer Fingerhut. Federated's shares 
were down 2 7/8 at 39 5/8. Fingerhut's were up 5 5/8 at 24 7/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Commerce Department reported an anemic 0.2  
percent growth in retail sales in January, their smallest gain 
since last summer.

<HEADLINE> Romney Called Perfect for the Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- When a co-worker's teen-age daughter was reported  
missing in 1997, millionaire venture capitalist Mitt Romney ordered 
his company to close. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney and 40 employees at Bain Capital Inc. went to New York  
City and combed the streets for the girl. She turned up in New 
Jersey after newspapers wrote of the search and circulated her 
picture. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he's needed, he relies on pure instinct and pure  
belief,'' said Michael Brown, president and co-founder of City 
Year, a volunteer organization with which Romney is involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knows when to drop things and do what's important,'' Brown  
said. ``He's a man of action. He's really inspiring. He has total 
integrity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An active Mormon and one-time Senate candidate in Massachusetts,  
Romney's squeaky-clean reputation was key to his being tapped 
Thursday as the new pilot of Salt Lake City's scandal-tainted 
Olympic committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had the opportunity to encounter a lot of highly  
intelligent, effective people in this world. Mitt would be in the 
top five,'' said Thomas Stemberg, chairman of Staples Inc., an 
office supply company Romney backed. 
</P>
<P>
	Stemberg credits Romney with saving Bain &AMP; Co. The Boston-based  
consulting firm ran into trouble after Romney left as chairman, but 
he returned to put it back on track. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the only person trusted by the company's warring  
factions, Stemberg said. ``He's one of the most dynamic problem 
solvers I have ever run into.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romney, 51, grew up in Michigan. His father, George Romney, was  
chairman of American Motors Corp. and governor of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Deeply religious, Mitt Romney went to France before college as a  
Mormon missionary for two years, earning a draft deferral from the 
Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
	He attended Stanford but followed his high school sweetheart,  
Ann, to Brigham Young University, where he graduated as 
valedictorian. He then went to Harvard to study law and business. 
</P>
<P>
	After graduating from Harvard with honors, Romney joined Bain &AMP;  
Co., where he rose to chairman. In 1984, he co-founded Bain 
Capital, a successful venture capital company affiliated with Bain. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney, who owns a house in Park City, Utah, was very involved  
in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, presiding over 
a group of congregations in the Boston area. 
</P>
<P>
	He is perhaps best known as the Republican who gave Sen. Edward  
M. Kennedy a scare in 1994 when Kennedy ran for re-election. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney spent $4 million of his own money in a race Kennedy won  
by painting him as a heartless capitalist. It was a close race 
until Kennedy ran an ad blitz featuring workers laid off from an 
Indiana company financed by Bain. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney has been derided as too good to be true -- a  
philanthropist with a perfect marriage and five sons who look as if 
they stepped out of a Crest toothpaste commercial. 
</P>
<P>
	But he can break out now and then, said Ann Murphy, his former  
campaign spokeswoman. She said Romney terrified her one snowy day 
doing ``doughnuts'' in his pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard not to sound too corny when you're talking about  
Mitt Romney,'' Ms. Murphy said. ``He was never judgmental about 
anybody. He was like that, too good to be true.''

<HEADLINE> Pittsburgh Starts Athlete Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Pittsburgh has joined at least 20 other cities  
in leveling a wage tax on non-resident pro athletes, money that 
will partially fund the city's two new sports stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
	Bad news for forward Mark Messier and the rest of the Vancouver  
Canucks: Because the tax is retroactive to the first day of the 
year, 1 percent of their one day's wages will be deducted for 
playing in Pittsburgh on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Tom Murphy's administration had hoped to use the $1.01  
million the tax is expected to raise annually to help fund new 
stadiums for the Pirates and Steelers and an expanded convention 
center. 
</P>
<P>
	But under a compromise worked out between Murphy and City  
Council, any amount above $750,000 a year will be placed into a 
special fund for youth programs. The fund will be administered by 
the city Parks Department. 
</P>
<P>
	City Finance Director Paul Hennigan said the city should begin  
collecting the tax within a couple of months. The tax is applicable 
to nonresident athletes coming into the city to play; athletes who 
reside locally are subject to the taxes of their local 
municipality. 
</P>
<P>
	``Morally, I can't think of anything better than having a  
ballplayer contribute to something like this,'' city Councilman Jim 
Ferlo said. ``This is one time I want to have millionaire 
ballplayers. The more they make, the better we do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because player salaries continue to climb in the NFL, NHL and  
major league baseball, the Murphy administration estimates that 
revenue from the tax could climb to $1.7 million annually by 2008. 
The city will commit approximately $7 million of the tax collected 
over 30 years to the stadiums and convention center.

<HEADLINE> De La Hoya Is Set To Fight Quartey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Oscar De La Hoya also has clout outside the  
ring. 
</P>
<P>
	His status as a gate attraction is such that he can withstand  
outside pressures that often force other boxers to fight even with 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	On Nov. 3, De La Hoya's fight against Ike Quartey of Ghana was  
postponed because of a cut over his left eye, so slight that some 
critics doubted it even existed. 
</P>
<P>
	Quartey said he had heard De La Hoya was not in top shape and  
had been knocked down in sparring. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was not a serious cut,'' admitted De La Hoya, who will  
defend the WBC title against Quartey in a battle of unbeaten 
welterweights Saturday night at the Thomas and Mack Center. ``It 
was a slight cut across (above) the eye, but I didn't want to take 
a chance with a fight of this magnitude,'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 26-year-old De La Hoya knows Quartey should provide the  
toughest test of his career. He also is well aware of his status as 
boxing's biggest attraction outside the heavyweight division, and 
how losses and sub-par performances would affect that status. 
</P>
<P>
	Of his last seven fights, five have been on pay-per-view, and  
those matches have grossed over $105 million in pay-per-view 
revenue. His victory over Pernell Whitaker in 1997 drew 800,000 
buys and grossed $35 million, the highest non-heavyweight 
pay-per-view gross and buy rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's fight also is being carried on pay-per-view by TVKO.  
De La Hoya is guaranteed $9 million, while Quartey is getting about 
$3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason for De La Hoya's drawing power is his attractiveness  
to women. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Taffet of TVKO said Thursday ``We periodically do research  
on who's watching, and increasingly more women are present in 
households that order and watch Oscar De La Hoya's fights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya, boxing's Golden Boy ever since he won a gold medal  
in the 1992 Olympics, also is a commercial success. His 
endorsements include McDonald's, Levis, Calvin Klein, Florsheim 
shoes and the Milk Council. 
</P>
<P>
	No wonder his philosophy is, ``If you're not 100 percent inside  
the ring, don't fight because you're risking everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His boxing career is now being run as a joint venture between  
Bob Arum's Top Rank and Oscar De La Hoya Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya has called off fights on four previous occasions.  
</P>
<P>
	As for postponing his November fight against Quartey because he  
was not in shape and had been knocked down, De La Hoya, said ``Not 
true at all, I actually was very disappointed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only difference between November and now, he said, ``is I  
feel more confident. I feel I've learned more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Quartey the postponement was a bitter bill. He was supposed  
to defend the WBA title against Whitaker last year, but the fight 
was canceled when Whitaker failed a post-fight drug test. He then 
was supposed to meet IBF champion Felix Trinidad, but that fight 
fell through when Trinidad became embroiled in litigation with 
promoter Don King. 
</P>
<P>
	So Quartey (34-0-1, 29 knockouts) has not fought since a  
12-round draw against Jose Lopez Oct. 17, 1997, in defense of the 
WBA title, of which he has been stripped for not making a mandatory 
defense within a prescribed time. 
</P>
<P>
	Should De La Hoya win, he is scheduled to defend against the  
winner of a 10-round bout between Frankie Randall and Oba Carr that 
also is on Saturday's card. The fight would be held in a 
12,000-seat arena at the new Mandalay Bay May 22 and be televised 
by HBO. 
</P>
<P>
	It is not known if Quartey would fight the Randall-Carr winner  
should he beat De La Hoya. He outpointed Carr in a WBA title 
defense in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Saturday's card will be a WBC super bantamweight title  
defense by Erik Morales of Mexico against Angel Chacon of Puerto 
Rico`

<HEADLINE> Romanian Turned Down Bribe Offers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- In the Romanian language, there are at  
least eight words for ``bribe.'' Andrei Siperco obviously knows 
them all -- and he knows how to say ``no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has emerged as one of the few people to turn down some of the  
many the gifts that Salt Lake City officials offered to 
International Olympic Committee members and their families. 
</P>
<P>
	Siperco, whose late father was the longest-serving member of the  
IOC, passed up free airline tickets, living expenses and even entry 
to a Utah university. 
</P>
<P>
	``It didn't seem right,'' he said Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	Siperco, 36, is an adviser on communications to President Emil  
Constantinescu. In an ethics panel report this week on misconduct 
by Salt Lake's bid committee in winning the 2002 Winter Games, it 
was revealed that Siperco turned down a 1996 offer to enroll at 
Brigham Young University to work on his doctorate in history. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Johnson, a vice president of the Salt Lake bidders, offered  
him ``a modest living expense as part of our approved grant 
program'' along with plane tickets and housing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to thank you for your generous offer that I have to  
decline because I consider that it is not appropriate for me to 
take any advantage ... (of a) member of family of the IOC in my 
relations with people involved in Olympic activity,'' Siperco wrote 
to Johnson in December 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Siperco's father served as the IOC's vice president from 1982-86  
and voted on the site of the 2002 Winter Olympics. He died in 
October at age 77. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the son recalled the Salt Lake offer.  
</P>
<P>
	``I told my father and he thought I had acted correctly,''  
Siperco said. ``He was more than happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Siperco said he smelled trouble because the scholarship was  
proposed by Salt Lake organizers rather than BYU. Siperco said he 
never discussed IOC business with his father and was not aware of 
other IOC members receiving perks. 
</P>
<P>
	As reports of IOC members and their families tapping into a well  
of cash, free vacations, medical care and education grants keep 
emerging, Siperco is relieved his family came out clean. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am happy my father's name is not connected to these  
revelations,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It would not have been unusual to accept such an offer in this  
former Communist country, where payoffs are common and the average 
monthly salary is only the equivalent of $100. 
</P>
<P>
	Even when Siperco turned down the offer, Salt Lake tried to  
change his mind. Three days after Siperco notified him of his 
refusal, Johnson sent a letter trying to ``convince you to 
reconsider.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``However, if you prefer, other means not associated with  
Olympic activity can be developed that you might deem more 
appropriate,'' Johnson wrote, adding, ``We certainly want you to 
feel comfortable in coming and living in Utah'' and ``are willing 
to take whatever steps necessary to make this happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That letter was singled out Thursday by IOC director general  
Francois Carrard, coordinator of the six-man IOC panel set up to 
investigate ethical misconduct by committee members. 
</P>
<P>
	``I find it totally improper when someone has clearly said,  
`No,' to come back and try to insist,'' Carrard said. ``People are 
quick to blame the IOC membership, but this shows that things are 
not as one-sided as some people say. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC certainly deserves blame. That we accept. I think we  
have our share of blame, but we should not be the only ones to be 
blamed.''

<HEADLINE> Mark Price to Announce Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Mark Price, a four-time All-Star who holds the  
NBA record for career free-throw percentage, will announce his 
retirement Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Price was waived by Orlando in June after just one season with  
the Magic and wasn't picked up by another team. His 12-year career 
will officially end with a news conference at Alexander Memorial 
Coliseum, where he starred for Georgia Tech in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Price, who turns 35 Monday, finishes with career averages of  
15.2 points and 6.7 assists per game. He holds the NBA career 
records for free throw percentage in the regular season (.904) and 
the playoffs (.944). 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot guard spent his first nine seasons with the Cleveland  
Cavaliers, making the All-Star team in 1989 and 1992-94. He was 
traded to Washington in 1995 but played only seven games for the 
Bullets because of a foot injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The following season, he signed with Golden State as a free  
agent, then was traded to the Magic in 1997. In his final season, 
he averaged 9.5 points and 4.7 assists in 63 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Price was the first major star at Georgia Tech after the school  
joined the Atlantic Coast Conference. He had 2,193 points from 
1983-86, making him the third-leading scorer in school history, and 
still holds the career record for steals with 240.

<HEADLINE> Dartmouth Decision Angers Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Dartmouth College's decision to push for an  
end to single-sex fraternities and sororities has angered students 
at the Ivy League school and prompted the cancellation of all major 
frat-sponsored parties on campus for the semester. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coed Fraternity Sorority Council's decision Wednesday  
includes the 21 events meant to coincide with this weekend's Winter 
Carnival, including the ``keg jump,'' an ice-skating event that was 
an 18-year tradition. 
</P>
<P>
	Andy Louis, student co-chairman of the Winter Carnival Council,  
said today that college-sponsored events would go on as planned. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamie Paul, member of the Coed Fraternity Sorority Council, said  
the cancellations were intended to show that without Greek life -- 
so-called because of the Greek letters used in fraternity and 
sorority names -- there's simply nothing to do at Dartmouth. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Greek system is a very huge thing up here,'' said Brad  
Bingham, a 22-year-old member of Alpha Delta from Patoka, Ind. ``If 
there was a city or a bigger town with more things to do, maybe it 
wouldn't be so important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dartmouth, founded in 1769, has had fraternities for more than  
150 years. They are a major part of the school's image and 
students' social life in Hanover, a town of about 9,000 people near 
the Vermont state line. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Miller, a member of Alpha Delta when he was a Dartmouth  
student, co-wrote ``Animal House,'' the 1978 film comedy about 
frat-house debauchery. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to students this week, officials announced plans to  
phase out the current Greek system to make college life 
``substantially coed'' and to encourage ``respectful relations 
between women and men.'' 
</P>
<P>
	College administrators said they are concerned about problem  
drinking and the exclusive nature of the Greek system. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the Ivy League school refused to say whether the  
plan means just requiring residential fraternities and sororities 
to go coed or phasing them out altogether, but said the changes 
could come as soon as next fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Administrators say they are seeking student suggestions, but  
many students were angry the college did not ask their opinions 
before announcing the change. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time they plant a tree or modify the curriculum, they  
constantly have student meetings and discussions,'' said Catherine 
Curran, a 19-year-old sophomore from Las Vegas. ``For something 
this drastic, they should have gotten student input.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A group of students, estimated at about 1,000 by The Dartmouth,  
the student newspaper, held a protest outside Dartmouth President 
James Wright's home Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the student newspaper, more than 35 percent of the  
4,300 undergraduates are members of 25 single-sex fraternities and 
sororities. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we get out of it is the friends we form by being in a  
bonding environment with the same 20 to 30 guys for years and 
years,'' said Timothy Naples, 20, a member of Alpha Chi Alpha from 
Garden City, N.Y. ``No coed house or other mandatory program from 
the school can do that.''

<HEADLINE> Sydney Olympic Sponsors Are Wary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- While Australian Olympic official Phil  
Coles battles to clear his name, Sydney Games officials face a 
battle to entice sponsors to link their name with the Olympic 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
	One of two Australian members of the International Olympic  
Committee, Coles is hoping to be cleared of wrongdoing in the 
scandal involving the Salt Lake City bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles, who is also one of the vice presidents of the Sydney  
Olympic Committee for the Olympic Games, said he had been defamed 
by a report from the board of ethics of the Salt Lake City 
organizing committee which alleged he and his family accepted four 
free trips to the United States as guests of the city's bid 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Salt Lake City board of ethics had acted in an  
unethical and immoral manner by making serious and unfounded 
allegations against him. 
</P>
<P>
	With $128 million in sponsorship still needing to be raised, the  
corruption alleged has left some sponsors disillusioned. 
</P>
<P>
	``New things seem to be coming to the surface each day and each  
time it obviously adds to the concern that we have,'' John Morrison 
of General Motors Molden, a major Sydney Games sponsor, told the 
Australian Broadcasting Corp on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult for a sponsor in the current environment to  
maximize its association with the Games as long as new things keep 
coming to the surface,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Morrison said the company was disturbed by the  
revelations, it was a ``long way'' from considering withdrawing its 
Sydney sponsorship. 
</P>
<P>
	Sydney Lord Mayor Frank Sartor said the latest allegations  
surrounding Coles created a bad image for Sydney. He hopes sponsors 
view it as temporary. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think sponsors can see through the current cloud which is  
blowing over us and which will blow away soon enough,'' Sartor 
said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Bulls Coach Meets With Media </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CRETE, Neb. (AP) -- What does President Truman have in common  
with Dennis Rodman? 
</P>
<P>
	Former Chicago Bulls coach Phil Jackson spoke about each of them  
Thursday during a visit to Doane College. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson met with players from Doane's basketball teams and held  
a 45-minute news conference before speaking in a packed gymnasium 
on the values of leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	In leading the Bulls for the past nine years, Jackson said he  
used a simple leadership philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Harry S. Truman said a leader is a man who gets people to do  
what they don't want to do and enjoy doing it,'' Jackson said. ``I 
think that's kind of the direction I wanted to go, although I don't 
like to think of it as getting people to do what they don't want to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to think you get people to do what they want to do  
and enjoy doing it with a vision that becomes a reality,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson resigned after guiding Chicago to a third straight NBA  
championship in June. Under his term, the Bulls won six NBA titles 
and an NBA-record 72 games in 1995-96. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson recalled how he dealt with Rodman, the flamboyant  
forward known for his outrageous behavior and ever-changing 
hairdos. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like they say about a hungry sheep, if you have a small  
pasture they'll find a way under the fence,'' Jackson said. ``But 
if you put a large pasture around it, it will take a long time to 
find a way out of that pasture. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the way it was in Dennis. We had to give him a lot of  
room and a lot less negative reaction to his outrageous behavior,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson declined to discuss the breakup of the Bulls. But he had  
a message for NBA fans -- get ready for life without Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have always been stars in the NBA, but I think it's time  
for the NBA to think about teams and the types of teams that are 
going to be playing,'' Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, Jackson makes a few speaking engagements each month  
and raises money for Bill Bradley, the former Democratic Senator 
from New Jersey who expects to run for president. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley and Jackson were teammates on the New York Knicks during  
the 1970s.

<HEADLINE> Senators' Quotes on Clinton Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from the statements of senators who have publicly  
declared their positions on the impeachment charges against 
President Clinton: 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis.: ``I will not vote for either article of  
impeachment but I also will not let go of my firm belief that this 
president has done real damage to the office of the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	``President Clinton's conduct was wrong, reckless and  
indefensible. Under the Constitution it does not justify removal. 
But for those who love this country it demands outrage and 
disappointment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb.: ``After weeks of listening, reading,  
reviewing, reflection, analysis and contemplation I have come to 
the conclusion that I will vote to convict the president on both 
articles of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``After stripping away the underbrush of legal technicalities  
and nuance, I find that the president abused his sacred power by 
lying and obstructing justice. How can parents instill values and 
morality in their children? How can educators teach our children? 
How can the rule of law for every American be applied equally if we 
have two standards of justice in America -- one for the powerful and 
the other for the rest of us?'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev.: ``The House alleges that specific  
crimes have been committed, to wit, perjury and obstruction of 
justice as defined in law. ... But is it impeachable conduct? Does 
it rise to the constitutional standard of bribery, treason or other 
high crimes and misdemeanors? I think not. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president's conduct is boorish, indefensible, even  
reprehensible. It does not threaten the republic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla.: ``The president's self-indulgent  
actions were immoral. Disgraceful. Reprehensible. History should -- 
and, I suspect, will -- judge that William Jefferson Clinton 
dishonored himself and the highest office in our American 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
	``But despite their disreputable nature, President Clinton's  
actions should not result in his conviction and removal from 
office. ... I have concluded that the charges against the president 
do not meet the high constitutional standards established by the 
framers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Wayne Allard, R-Colo.: ``I have sadly come to the  
conclusion that President Clinton committed perjury and obstructed 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``When President Clinton chose not to 'tell the truth, the whole  
truth, and nothing but the truth,' he put himself above the law. He 
violated his oath and undermined the rule of law which he had been 
sworn to uphold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.: ``I will vote against  
conviction and removal of President William Jefferson Clinton on 
both articles of impeachment. I do not believe the House managers 
established beyond a reasonable doubt that this president is guilty 
of perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``But let me be perfectly clear: I do not condone the behavior  
of President Clinton. I do not defend it, and I do not accept it. 
The conduct at the heart of the charges is deplorable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I.: ``The Constitution and the evidence  
compels me to vote to acquit the president on both articles of 
impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president has disgraced himself and dishonored his office.  
He has offended the justified expectations of the American people 
that the presidency must be above the sordid episodes revealed in 
the record before us. However, the House managers failed to 
establish that the president's conduct amounts to 'high crimes and 
misdemeanors' requiring his removal from office in accordance with 
the Constitution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore.: ``Today I will cast two votes as your  
senator to convict and remove the president of the United States. 
...
</P>
<P>
	``I struggled throughout the trial to find a way to acquit the  
president, if possible, on both or at least one of the articles. 
But in the end, the facts, stubborn facts, kept getting in the way. 
...
</P>
<P>
	``I refuse to say that high political polls and soaring Wall  
Street indexes give license to those in high places who act in low 
and illegal ways.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill.: ``The president's personal conduct  
was clearly wrong. He has endured embarrassment and will spend the 
rest of his natural life and forever in the annals of history 
branded by this experience. ... What has occurred here is a 
personal and family tragedy -- it is not a national tragedy which 
should result in the removal of this president from office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.: ``I will be voting to acquit the  
president on both counts. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``I concluded the president lied in the civil deposition. ...  
The obstruction case was weak -- stitched together by circumstantial 
evidence and not-provable assumptions about what was in the 
president's mind, and it was not supportable by the facts. ... I 
further concluded the president's actions were wrong and arrogant, 
but they did not rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors 
as written in the Constitution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.: ``If the evidence required to convict a  
president in an impeachment trial is allowed to be less than that 
required in a shoplifting trial, the constitutional foundation for 
the presidency will disintegrate before our very eyes. That's 
something a few future presidents in this body would do well to 
consider. Today I will vote to acquit on both counts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.: ``I will vote to acquit the  
president, and it is not because his poll numbers are high or 
because the economy is good. And it is not because Bill Clinton is 
a Democrat. ... And it is because of my deep reverence for the 
Constitution that I believe we must reject the articles of 
impeachment before us today. Why? Because the high crimes and 
misdemeanors constitutional requirement for removal has not been 
met -- not even close. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to say that yes, my daughter is married to the  
first lady's brother, a brother who loves and admires his sister 
and doesn't want to see her hurt. So, I am far from being a 
defender of the president's behavior. But I am a fierce defender of 
the Constitution.''

<HEADLINE> Federated Buys Fingerhut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Federated Department Stores Inc. moved  
Thursday to put more punch into its catalog and Internet sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The company behind the Macy's and Bloomingdale's chains  
announced it is buying Fingerhut Cos. Inc., a Minneapolis-based 
company catalog retailer that specializes in selling to consumers 
through catalogs and World Wide Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Federated is offering $1.5 billion in cash under the deal that  
sent Fingerhut shares soaring almost 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The move comes as retailers are faced with a growing force of  
shoppers who opt to point and click to make their purchases from 
home rather than step inside a store. 
</P>
<P>
	Last March, Dayton Hudson Corp., another large department store  
chain, purchased direct-seller Rivertown Trading Co. At the time of 
the deal, Dayton Hudson said Rivertown's direct-selling expertise 
would put it in a good position whenever Internet retailing took 
off. 
</P>
<P>
	Fingerhut will be a subsidiary of Federated, but will remain  
based in Minneapolis, under the agreement that is subject to 
approval by regulators. The boards of both companies already have 
endorsed the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all good news. We're not moving our headquarters, no  
one's losing jobs,'' said Will Lansing, president of Fingerhut. 
``We'll have more resources. We will be doing additional catalogs, 
we'll continue to make acquisitions and Internet investments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition will strengthen Federated's effort to build its  
cyberspace retailing business, said retail analyst Kurt Barnard. 
</P>
<P>
	``They needed a distribution network which was more efficient  
than anything they had -- and they got that with this deal,'' said 
Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report in Upper 
Montclair, N.J. ``It will enhance the efficiency of the catalogs 
that Federated already has and help it expand into areas that it 
hasn't been before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federated already has Bloomingdale's By Mail and Macy's By Mail  
direct mail catalogs and the Macys.com Internet site. 
</P>
<P>
	It is looking to expand those nonstore operations through  
Fingerhut's expertise in handling orders through catalogs and the 
Internet, in addition to Fingerhut's capabilities in database 
management and direct marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	In the deal, Fingerhut shareholders will receive $25 a share in  
cash. Federated will also assume $200 million in Fingerhut debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Federated said the acquisition may reduce its earnings, but  
declined to be specific. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading on the New York Stock Exchange was heavy in both stocks  
Thursday as Federated fell 6.6 percent, or by $2.81 1/4 to $39.68 3/4, 
while Fingerhut stock shot up $5.56 1/4 to $24.37 1/2 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Federated has annual sales of more than $15.8 billion. The  
retailer operates more than 400 department stores in 33 states 
under the names Bloomingdale's, The Bon Marche, Burdines, 
Goldsmith's, Lazarus, Macy's, Rich's and Stern's. 
</P>
<P>
	Fingerhut's core catalog generates most of the company's  
approximately $2 billion in annual sales. Fingerhut also operates 
catalogs under the names of Figi's, a food and gift catalog; 
Arizona Mail Order and Bedford Fair, both apparel catalogs; and 
Popular Club, a membership-based general merchandise catalog. 
</P>
<P>
	Fingerhut operates its own Web sites and has minority interests  
in four electronic-commerce companies: PC Flowers &AMP; Gifts, an 
online provider of flowers, gift baskets and gourmet food; The Zone 
Network, parent company of mountainzone.com; FreeShop.com, an 
online provider of free merchandise and links to other e-commerce 
sites; and Roxy Systems Inc., an Internet marketer of digital 
communications and entertainment services. 
</P>
<P>
	The company was started in 1948 by the late Manny Fingerhut, a  
one-time bookkeeper at a car dealership. Its chief executive is now 
his son-in-law, Theodore Diekel. 
</P>
<P>
	Fingerhut sells on credit to customers with an average household  
income of $27,700, saying it offers lower-income people a way to 
buy things they otherwise couldn't afford. 
</P>
<P>
	Its finance charges have been challenged by consumers in a  
January lawsuit in Minnesota. Fingerhut has said it complies with 
regulations and believes its interest rates on credit sales are 
competitive.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Little Changed / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices were little changed Thursday as the  
stock market surged and the government concluded a week of heavy 
borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was unchanged  
from Wednesday as its yield held at 5.36 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury bonds had gained early in the week as investors sought  
a haven for their funds during the stock market's turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
	But stocks stabilized Wednesday and soared Thursday, when the  
technology-stacked Nasdaq composite gained 96.05, its biggest 
one-day point gain ever. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 
186.15 Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders also were assessing demand for the government's latest  
auctions. The Treasury sold $10 billion in 30-year bonds Thursday 
to wrap up its quarterly borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, two reports showed the U.S. economy continues to  
hum along, reducing chances the Federal Reserve will lower interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported that retail sales increased 0.2  
percent in January, which comes on top of a huge 1 percent jump in 
December. Separately, the Labor Department reported that jobless 
claims dropped by 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 281,000, the 
lowest level since July 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were down between 1/32 point and 1/16 point, and intermediate 
maturities were unchanged to down 1/16 point, reported Bridge 
Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.49 percent as the  
discount rose 0.01 percentage point to 4.39 percent. Six-month 
yields were 4.54 percent, as the discount rose 0.02 percentage 
point to 4.39 percent. One-year yields were 4.66 percent as the 
discount rose by 0.04 percentage point to 4.45 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 4.75 from 4.63 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell to 125 11/32 from 125 3/8. The average 
yield to maturity was unchanged at 5.12 percent.

<HEADLINE> Postmaster Seeks Price Flexibility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Postmaster General William J. Henderson  
pressed for more freedom in setting prices Thursday at a hearing on 
improving postal operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our having pricing flexibility is very important to ... future  
postal health,'' Henderson told the House Government Reform post 
office subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	The subcommittee is working on a bill that would make changes in  
the law governing postal operations and is being barraged with 
suggestions from the post office, its competitors, major mailers, 
unions and other interested groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The subcommittee's chairman, Rep. John M. McHugh, R-N.Y., said  
the bill is ``not about breaking up the Postal Service, as the 
court system required of AT&AMP;T, nor is it about trying to force 
competition into the postal and delivery sector. ... The postal 
system is already fiercely competitive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson noted that foreign mail services are becoming  
increasingly competitive, seeking parcel and other delivery 
business in the United States and around the world. In particular, 
he noted, Germany's Deutsche Post and the British Royal Mail are 
active internationally. 
</P>
<P>
	Pricing flexibility is needed to meet this competition,  
Henderson said, noting that it currently takes 10 months to get 
price changes approved by the independent Postal Rate Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Postal rates increased last month for the first time in four  
years, with the cost of mailing a first-class letter going up a 
penny -- to 33 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	The post office has submitted a series of proposed amendments to  
the bill seeking more freedom in setting prices and some have 
accused the agency of trying to scuttle the measure through 
amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're absolutely, positively, not out to kill'' the bill,  
Henderson said when McHugh asked him about the reports. ``We 
understand this is a work in progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The post office has proposed amendments, Henderson said, but is  
not drawing any line in the sand. 
</P>
<P>
	One provision being discussed would set price caps on various  
types of mail, allowing the post office to vary its prices under 
those caps when dealing with large-volume mailers. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the measure would require that the Postal Service,  
which does not receive a taxpayer subsidy, to continue to provide 
universal service, bringing mail to everyone in the country 
regularly.

<HEADLINE> Gore Pushes Retirement Savings Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore urged Congress on  
Thursday to approve the Clinton administration's $1 billion plan to 
help people save money for retirement, saying pensions can no 
longer be rigid in today's ever-changing American work force. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president touted pension legislation that would assist  
small businesses in starting retirement plans, let workers 
contribute to individual retirement accounts through payroll 
deductions and make it easier for workers to take their pensions 
with them when they change jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said the reforms are necessary because many workers today  
change jobs more frequently than in the past. Allowing them the 
flexibility to transfer their pensions and 401(k) savings accounts 
would ensure they won't cash out and spend the money. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are few things we can do in America that will make a  
bigger, long-range difference for families than giving more 
retirement security,'' Gore said. ``It really is a great challenge, 
how we can strengthen one of our oldest values ... at a time when 
we are experiencing a rapidly changing context.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much of Clinton's pension proposals would be implemented under a  
bill introduced Thursday by Reps. Earl Pomeroy, D-N.D. , and Jim 
Kolbe, R-Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, many of Clinton's proposals were part of a bipartisan  
pension portability bill proposed by Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., Sen. 
Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, Sen. Jim Jeffords, R-Vt. , and Pomeroy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't hope to meet the retirement challenges of the 21st  
century if we continue to think in 19th century terms,'' Graham 
said. ``I applaud the administration for joining the fight to bring 
rationality to an irrational system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffords said the legislation would be particularly useful for  
small businesses, many of whom offer little or no retirement 
benefits. ``That's what is good for the people of Vermont, many of 
whom work in small businesses,'' Jeffords said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said the legislation would be especially beneficial to  
women, who tend to have less pension coverage than men, and to more 
than 50 million people who have no pension plan at all. He lauded 
the lawmakers for their bipartisan commitment, saying it shows the 
legislation has promising chances of passage . He read aloud a list 
of members of Congress who support such reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of things we address come and go in a short period of  
time,'' Gore said. ``The changes we're talking about here, if we 
bring them about in a responsible bipartisan way, can cascade down 
through many generations and strengthen families over the long 
haul.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton plan, which costs an estimated $1.027 billion over  
five years, would: 
</P>
<P>
	--Establish a three-year tax credit to encourage small businesses  
to establish 401(k), payroll deduction IRA, pensions or other 
retirement programs. 
</P>
<P>
	--Allow individual retirement account contributions of up to  
$2,000 to be excluded from an employee's income, to encourage low- 
to moderate-wage earners to save. 
</P>
<P>
	--Allow vesting for employer matching contribution plans, such as  
a 401(k), after three years of service, rather than the current 
five years. The goal is to prevent employees from losing employer 
matching contributions if they change jobs after four years. 
</P>
<P>
	--Permit rolling over savings between various types of retirement  
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	--Allow workers who take time off for family or medical leave, to  
count that time toward vesting requirements for their retirement 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	--Establish a process for informing workers and their spouses  
about their pension rights.

<HEADLINE> Retail Sales Gain in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After-Christmas discounts enticed shoppers  
into department stores and malls in January, helping to produce a 
modest increase in retail sales on top of stellar gains during the 
holidays. 
</P>
<P>
	The 0.2 percent increase, reported Thursday by the Commerce  
Department, followed a large 1 percent gain in December and 
dovetailed with economists' belief that robust economic growth at 
the end of 1998 is carrying over into early 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``January's retail sales level was not spectacular, but given  
what happened at the end of 1998, even a small increase is 
impressive,'' said economist Joel Naroff of First Union Corp in 
Philadelphia. ``People spent tons of money on everything in the 
malls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In another sign the good times just won't quit, the number of  
unemployment applications unexpectedly dropped last week to the 
lowest level in more than a year and a half. 
</P>
<P>
	Jobless claims dropped by 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted  
281,000, the lowest level since July 1997, the Labor Department 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A strong labor market has been one of the key fundamentals  
driving consumer spending over the past year and the figure on 
initial (unemployment) claims indicate that labor demand remains 
strong,'' said economist Michael Moran of Daiwa Securities America 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Low interest rates, restrained inflation and high stock prices  
also have driven sales higher. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers continue to spend like drunken sailors because their  
stock portfolios rack up big gains,'' said economist Ken Mayland of 
KeyCorp in Cleveland. ``That underscores a major point: with 
respect to consumer spending growth in 1999, the stock market could 
be either a saving grace or a major depressant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For now, though, half the respondents to an ABC News poll said  
now is an excellent or good time to buy things they want or need. 
</P>
<P>
	While the overall increase in sales was relatively muted, sales  
at department stores and other general merchandisers soared 1.5 
percent, the biggest increase in 11 months. In a separate report 
earlier this month, big discount chains such as Wal-Mart, Target 
and Kmart recorded the strongest gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Clothing, shoe and accessory shops reported a 1 percent increase  
in January, and drug stores, an 0.8 percent advance. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, auto sales rose 0.2 percent on top of a big 2.2  
percent jump in January. Receipts at building-supply and garden 
centers were unchanged after a healthy 1.9 percent gain in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	Furniture sales fell 0.4 percent, the worst performance in nine  
months. They were strong through much of 1998, helped by spillover 
from record home sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales also fell at food stores, 0.5 percent; gas stations, 0.5  
percent; and restaurants and bars, 0.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said falling prices depressed receipts at gas stations  
and food stores. They said a cold snap early in the month probably 
helped clothing sales but hurt restaurant turnout.

<HEADLINE> Ventura Doll Debuts at Toy Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Success has turned Jesse Ventura into a real  
doll. 
</P>
<P>
	An action figure of the Minnesota governor and former  
professional wrestler is making its debut at this week's American 
International Toy Fair. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-inch doll has different clothing options: a dark  
gubernatorial-like suit, a Navy SEAL outfit, and a black sweatshirt 
and loose-fitting pants. The sweatshirt bears the logo of Champlin 
Park High School, where Ventura is a volunteer football coach. 
</P>
<P>
	The dolls are expected to be in stores in April, priced at $15  
to $20. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 60,000 of the action figures have been ordered this  
week, and the manufacturer expects that number to reach 300,000 by 
shipping time. 
</P>
<P>
	First lady and horse rancher Terry Ventura also has agreed to  
have an action figure made in her image -- as long as it comes with 
a toy horse.

<HEADLINE> Mike Utley Prepares To Walk Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The last time Mike Utley took a step by himself  
in public, he was an offensive guard for the Detroit Lions, moving 
to block another player in a game at the Silverdome on Nov. 17, 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Utley lost his balance, sending his 6-foot-6, 315-pound body  
down on his head and neck, crushing his sixth and seventh 
vertebrae. Seven years later, Utley is prepared to walk next week -- 
to take at least one or two steps unassisted for the first time 
since the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Utley, 33, is expected to take his first public steps Monday in  
Phoenix, flanked by two friends -- Lions linebacker Rob Fredrickson 
and former NFL center Bill Lewis -- with a handful of reporters as 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doctors at Craig Hospital in Denver are calling this  
remarkable but not miraculous,'' Utley's spokeswoman, Allison Ward, 
was quoted as saying in today's issues of the Detroit Free Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Utley was told he probably would never walk again, he  
never quit trying. 
</P>
<P>
	He learned to move in a wheelchair and with crutches. He learned  
to drive a specially equipped car, to ski and to skydive. He lifted 
weights to keep his upper body strong. And he vowed someday to 
walk. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Utley has what is considered an ``incomplete injury,''  
Ward said, he has been able to regain some feeling in his 
extremities and to a certain extent some use of his legs. 
</P>
<P>
	``In view of that and in view of the fact Mike has been busting  
his butt in the gym seven days a week for the last several years,'' 
Ward said, ``he's to the point where he's regaining some movement. 
This is really just a story of gritting it out. He has never given 
up, and he is one of the most physically healthy guys out there who 
has been injured in the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the progress has occurred in the past month, Ward said.  
Utley has tested his ability to walk -- a step or two at a time -- 
wearing shoes with leg braces. Ms. Ward said he now was ready to go 
public with his improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not saying that he's walking,'' she said. ``The term he's  
using is that he's `taking steps,' which is a long way from 
actually walking but is a huge improvement and a huge show of 
determination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Utley issued this statement: ``My job now has been to work hard  
to get back on my feet again. Just recently, I have accomplished 
what some doctors told me was impossible. I stood up and took a few 
steps. This injury does change you if you let it. I won't let it.''

<HEADLINE> Papers Signed by Babe Ruth Stolen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Papers signed by Babe Ruth when he bought a home  
in the 1920s have been stolen. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery comes just one day after a probation officer in  
Suffolk County was arraigned on charges he stole deceased baseball 
players' wills. 
</P>
<P>
	``One person's treasure is another person's junk,'' Michael  
Ring, the Middlesex County First Assistant Register of Deeds, told 
the Boston Herald. ``It would never have dawned on me that someone 
would take them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The documents are dated June 26, 1923, when Ruth paid $10,000  
for ``Home Run Farm,'' a home and 180-acre plot in Sudbury about 20 
miles west of Boston, the Herald reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruth lived there with his first wife, Helen, and daughter,  
Dorothy. He turned the house over to his wife, whom he later 
divorced, in 1926. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the paperwork, all of which contained the signature of  
``George Herman Ruth,'' was stolen though some defaced documents 
remain, Ring said. 
</P>
<P>
	No connection was made between the missing papers and the arrest  
of Suffolk County probation officer Joseph Schnabel, 55, of 
Pembroke, who is accused of swiping wills of baseball players from 
a vault at the Suffolk County Courthouse. He pleaded innocent 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Those papers bore the signatures of some of baseball's earliest  
superstars -- George Wright, Hugh Duffy and Tommy McCarthy, Hall of 
Famers who played for Boston teams in the late 19th and early 20th 
centuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The wills were found on the sports memorabilia market last year,  
though many of the papers remain missing.

<HEADLINE> Holbrooke Seeks Senate Confirmation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After almost nine months, the United Nations  
ambassador-in-waiting is finally back to the beginning, ready to 
start seeking Senate confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
	That will take time.  
</P>
<P>
	The long process of clearing Richard Holbrooke, a career  
diplomat the Senate approved for three earlier appointments, is all 
part of the system of checking, nominating and confirming the 
people the president chooses. 
</P>
<P>
	It can be a balky system, sometimes over questions of past  
conduct, as in Holbrooke's case, sometimes over politics, sometimes 
over policy differences, with confirmation as hostage. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton named Holbrooke for the U.N. post June 18, but the  
nomination didn't get to the Senate until late Wednesday, a day 
after an ethics complaint was settled. 
</P>
<P>
	The appointment snagged in the clearance process, after the  
State Department got an anonymous complaint accusing Holbrooke of 
improper contacts with former colleagues after he left the 
government in 1996. His financial disclosure report also was 
questioned, and he wound up amending that. 
</P>
<P>
	The contacts controversy took longer, leading to investigations  
at the State Department, then by the Justice Department, and, 
finally, to the settlement. Holbrooke agreed to pay $5,000 to 
settle civil charges of breaching federal ethics laws, although he 
said he'd done nothing improper. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke resigned as an assistant secretary of state two years  
ago and went into investment banking. Former government officials 
are not allowed to deal with their old colleagues on business 
matters for a year after leaving office. Holbrooke did, although 
the Justice Department said it wasn't a willful violation. It was 
clouded by his post-retirement role as a special government 
employee, advising U.S. diplomats. He also has undertaken peace 
missions to Kosovo and Cyprus. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke said he'd settled the ethics suit ``to allow my  
nomination to proceed.'' Clinton said it would, soon, praising 
Holbrooke as ``extraordinarily well qualified'' for the United 
Nations position, filled by a deputy as acting ambassador since 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	But Holbrooke won't get there soon. Sen. Jesse Helms, chairman  
of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which acts first, has a 
U.N. agenda himself and is likely to use the nomination to press 
his demands for an overhaul of U.N. budgets and operations and a 
cut in U.S. assessments. 
</P>
<P>
	Coincidentally, or perhaps not, he's said to be planning to  
retrace the Justice Department investigation, step by step. 
</P>
<P>
	It is all part of a system that invites delays and disputes.  
Clinton has had confirmation troubles since he chose his first 
Cabinet. At one point in the Holbrooke holdup, he bristled that 
congressional inertia was blocking confirmation -- when he'd never 
sent the nomination to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican Senate has its own complaint, over the use of  
long-term acting appointees to keep unconfirmed officials in their 
jobs, as in the case of the assistant attorney general for civil 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton nominated Bill Lann Lee in July 1997. Lee still holds  
the job on an acting basis, his confirmation blocked by GOP 
opposition over his record on affirmative action. 
</P>
<P>
	There were stalls in confirming the census director, because of  
the dispute over the way to count in 2000; and the surgeon general, 
over his views on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke's credentials for the U.N. position are not in  
question, and his eventual confirmation by the Senate is all but 
certain, despite the investigation and his settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said crises from Iraq to Kosovo demand U.S. and U.N.  
leadership and make it ``essential that we have a strong and 
capable diplomat'' like Holbrooke as ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look forward to the Senate's timely consideration of his  
nomination,'' Clinton said. But in this case, he can't blame the 
Senate for dragging out the process. That's already happened, 
before the nomination even got there. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Iran Marks Islamic Revolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Verses from the Koran read over mosque  
loudspeakers echoed through Tehran today while hundreds of 
thousands gathered to mark the 20th anniversary of Iran's Islamic 
revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to the crowd at Tehran's Freedom Square, President  
Mohammad Khatami marked the anniversary by promising to usher in a 
new era of order and law. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stability of the revolution is only possible with the rule  
of law,'' said Khatami, whose moderate policies have irked 
hard-line clergymen and sparked charges that he was undermining the 
revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	``Defending the revolution is defending the constitution,''  
Khatami said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, helicopters hovering above Freedom Square showered the  
crowds with colorful leaflets. Free soft drinks and sweets were 
distributed in the streets surrounding the square, a symbol of 
Iran's 1979 revolution that toppled the pro-Western monarchy of the 
shah and installed a clergy-led regime. 
</P>
<P>
	In a message to the nation on the eve of the anniversary, Iran's  
supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said: ``Our great revolution 
marched on its arduous road with pride and confidence'' despite 
``hostile acts'' by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pioneer and harbinger of irreconcilable enmity (with Iran)  
was the American government and its Zionist appendix in the Middle 
East,'' Khamenei added, alluding to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	But the only obvious anti-Western hint in today's gathering at  
Freedom Square came when several demonstrators set fire to two 
American flags and an effigy of Uncle Sam. 
</P>
<P>
	The festivities also included several firsts for the Islamic  
republic. Actors dressed as Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny and a 
variety of animals sang and danced in a carnival-like parade. 
</P>
<P>
	There also was a pop concert, and Italian composer and singer  
Franco Battiato is to perform in Tehran for three nights next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Such events point to how much the government's restrictions on  
music and dance have been eased since the reform-minded Khatami 
took office in 1997. He has been accused by Islamic hard-liners of 
undermining the revolution by relaxing Islamic social restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Khatami's promises of more political freedoms for Iran's 60  
million people have angered powerful hard-line rivals who control 
key institutions such as the judiciary, the security forces, the 
intelligence network and the office of Khamenei, who has the last 
say on all matters. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past 18 months, hard-liners have resorted to more  
violence to deal with pro-Khatami opponents. Vigilantes have 
attacked dissidents, liberal newspapers and even a reformist 
Cabinet minister. The intelligence minister resigned Tuesday after 
the department, controlled by hard-liners, admitted that its agents 
were involved in the killing of dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Khatami today called for civil rights to be respected, saying  
the best way to reach that goal was to participate in the running 
of the country, including local elections scheduled for February 
26. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite several parades and the lights, flags, banners and  
posters adorning trees and walls, the anniversary festivities were 
rather tame. Iran's economic woes, caused by record-low oil prices, 
have forced the government to cut spending. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's celebrations also fall on the anniversary of the  
death of a Shiite Muslim saint, Imam Jafar Sadeq, and so are less 
festive than usual. Several black flags of mourning flew alongside 
the banners of the Islamic Republic at Freedom Square. 
</P>
<P>
	State-run television ran live coverage of today's events at  
Freedom Square interspersed with footage from the days of the 
revolution -- mostly mobs clashing with troops of the shah's regime. 
</P>
<P>
	The anniversary festivities, which built to a crescendo today,  
began February 1, the day the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the 
father of the revolution, returned to Iran from France after 15 
years in exile. 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year rule of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi collapsed on Feb.  
11.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Jets Bomb Iraq Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. fighter jets fired on several Iraqi  
military installations today while patrolling the northern 
``no-fly'' zone over Iraq, American officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	All the confrontations occurred in the vicinity of Mosul,  
according to the U.S. European Command. No U.S. personnel were 
injured and no planes were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	The strikes occurred shortly after noon, Iraqi time. The first  
came after an Air Force F-15E observed Iraqi anti-aircraft 
artillery fire and was targeted by an Iraqi radar system, U.S. 
officials said. In response, the plane dropped four 
precision-guided bombs on a surface-to-air-missile communications 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	Two F-15Es launched a missile and dropped four bombs on an Iraqi  
SAM system. 
</P>
<P>
	An hour later, U.S. pilots retaliated in three separate  
incidents, with F-15Es bombing a SAM site and a communications 
site, and an Air Force F-16CJ launching a high-speed anti-radiation 
missile at an Iraqi radar site. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, U.S. and British planes fired on three Iraqi  
missile sites after Iraqi warplanes violated the southern 
``no-fly'' zone.

<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- A federal appeals court has upheld a  
Virginia law that prohibits state employees from looking at 
sexually explicit material via the Internet while at work. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on Wednesday that  
the law does not infringe state employees' freedom of expression. 
</P>
<P>
	Six professors at public colleges challenged the law, arguing it  
would impede their ability to conduct legitimate research. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 4th Circuit agreed with lawyers for the state who argued  
that the government has a right to supervise on-the-job activities 
of its employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue in this case was really very simple: The taxpayers  
should not be forced to pay for the use of state computers by state 
employees, on state time, for downloading pornography on the 
Internet,'' said state Attorney General Mark Earley. 
</P>
<P>
	Kent Willis of the American Civil Liberties Union criticized the  
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an enormously disappointing decision that runs against  
the grain of free-speech decisions regarding the Internet,'' he 
said, adding that no decision has been made on whether to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	A bill to repeal the 1996 law is pending before the state  
Senate. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> GM: Others' Side Air Bags Dangerous </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Rival automakers are questioning findings by  
General Motors Corp. that some competitors' side air bags could 
seriously injure or kill children who are leaning against them 
during a crash. 
</P>
<P>
	At the media preview of the Chicago Auto Show on Thursday, GM  
played videotapes of tests that show the neck of a small test dummy 
being snapped forward violently as an air bag was deployed. The 
dummy representing a 3-year-old was positioned as if it were a 
child sleeping against the door. 
</P>
<P>
	Tape of the same test on GM's Chevrolet Venture minivan showed  
its side air bags deployed more gently. While GM's side air bags 
are as powerful as others, they allow some of the air to escape 
through vents if someone is seated too close. 
</P>
<P>
	GM did not identify whose air bags pose a threat. ``We're not  
interested in poking our competition in the eye,'' said Robert C. 
Lange, director of GM's safety center near Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	But the announcement was immediately questioned by automakers  
who have led the industry in offering side air bags. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had three years of experience with this technology and  
we have not had a report of that sort of injury,'' said spokesman 
Steven Rossi of Mercedes-Benz of North America Inc. ``We've put it 
through exhaustive testing and have not had any surprising 
results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rob Mitchell, a spokesman for another German automaker, BMW,  
said passengers are better off in a car with air bags than without. 
``The risk of injury from an air bag is nothing near the risk of 
injury from an accident,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While side air bags can reduce the risk of head, chest and  
pelvis injuries to properly seated and belted adults, there are no 
government regulations to guide automakers on how forceful side air 
bags should be to limit potential injury to children. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recently  
asked automakers to thoroughly test side air bags with adult and 
child dummies in a variety of positions to determine the risk of 
serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
	While front air bags have been blamed on the deaths of at least  
69 children and 56 adults since 1990, they have saved an estimated 
3,800 lives. There have been no documented deaths yet from side air 
bags, which have just entered the market in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Ford, several other automakers  
have introduced side air bags on some models recently. GM offers 
side air bags standard on its Chevy, Oldsmobile and Pontiac 
minivans, the Cadillac Seville and DeVille, and as an option on the 
subcompact Chevrolet Prizm.

<HEADLINE> De La Hoya, Quartey Ready To Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Finally, a test for Oscar De La Hoya. Finally,  
a fight for Ike Quartey. 
</P>
<P>
	In what has become a rarity in boxing, two unbeaten fighters in  
their prime meet Saturday night when De La Hoya defends his WBC 
welterweight title against a boxer generally considered to be the 
first true test of De La Hoya's short but brilliant career. 
</P>
<P>
	``People realize Ike Quartey has the best chance of beating  
me,'' De la Hoya said. ``This is a real, true fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For De La Hoya, it's a chance to pick up at least $9 million as  
well as quiet some of the critics who claim he's built his career 
on wins over fighters who were fading or not at their very best. 
</P>
<P>
	For Quartey, it's a chance to fight for the first time in 16  
months. Bouts with Pernell Whitaker and Felix Trinidad fell 
through, and his original Nov. 21 fight with De La Hoya was 
postponed because of a cut over De La Hoya's left eye. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll break his neck like a chicken,'' said Quartey, who  
defended the WBA version of the 147-pound title seven times before 
losing it for not making a mandatory defense. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya is a 3 1/2-1 favorite to retain his WBC title against  
Quartey, a native of Ghana whose only blemish on his record came 
when Jose Luis Lopez knocked him down in the 11th round and came up 
with a draw. 
</P>
<P>
	That bout took place Oct. 17, 1997, and Quartey (34-0-1) has not  
fought since despite having three different dates lined up against 
top opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	Quartey was especially bitter over the postponement of his fight  
with De La Hoya after the champion said he suffered the cut in 
training. De La Hoya later appeared at a news conference showing no 
trace of the cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very angry,'' Quartey said. ``He was trying to buy time.''  
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya, who stopped Julio Cesar Chavez only two months  
before the scheduled fight with Quartey, said he didn't want to 
take the chance of going into such an important fight at less than 
full strength. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was not a serious cut,'' De La Hoya said. ``It was a slight  
cut across (above) the eye, but I didn't want to take a chance with 
a fight of this magnitude.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The postponement came after Quartey's fight last April with  
Whitaker was scrapped after Whitaker tested positive for cocaine, 
and a fight with Trinidad, the IBF welterweight champion, fell 
through because of promotional conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ike had a bad 1998,'' said Dino Duva, Quartey's promoter.  
``But Oscar De La Hoya has made the biggest mistake of his boxing 
career fighting him now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya, who abandoned his boxing skills to go toe-to-toe  
with Chavez in his last fight, faces a bigger puncher in Quartey, 
who has stopped 29 of his 35 opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	De la Hoya stopped Chavez at the end of the eighth round and is  
now 29-0 with 24 knockouts in a career that has seen him earn more 
than $100 million in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I need to fight the tough guys to bring out the best in me,''  
De La Hoya said. ``I'm gong to have to prepare my mind for possibly 
losing. Hopefully it won't happen. I'll go down as many times as I 
have to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya is already a champion in four weight divisions and  
has beaten nine different current or former champions in his 
spectacular career. Still, he has been criticized for carefully 
picking his opponents, catching them at times they might not be 
their best. 
</P>
<P>
	``This fight is big because it's a barometer of where Oscar De  
La Hoya truly is,'' said Sugar Ray Leonard, who was brought in to 
help sell the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Quartey, the youngest of 27 brothers and sisters, will earn  
about $3 million for the fight. Almost as important, he gets the 
chance to make a name for himself for future lucrative fights 
against the likes of Whitaker and Trinidad, who meet later this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been waiting all my life for this opportunity,'' Quartey  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight could develop into a tactical battle of jabs, with  
each boxer possessing one of the best in the division. If it comes 
to power, De La Hoya said he will be more than happy to test his 
punching ability against that of Quartey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have what it takes to shot it out with anybody,'' De La Hoya  
said. ``I can stand my ground whenever I want. But I have to ask 
myself if that is the smartest thing I can do to win this fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If De La Hoya wins, he won't have to look far to find his next  
opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	On the undercard, former three-time champion Frankie Randall is  
fighting Oba Carr in an elimination bout with the winner to fight 
De La Hoya in late May. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would change my life in so many ways,'' said the  
37-year-old Randall, who made history as the first fighter to beat 
Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight card is expected to draw a crowd of about 12,000 to  
the UNLV campus arena. It will be televised on pay-per-view at a 
suggested retail of $39.95. The televised portion of the card 
begins at 9 p.m. EST, with the main event about 11:30 p.m.

<HEADLINE> Earnhardt, Labonte Win Qualifiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- As if Dale Earnhardt needed more  
confidence going into the Daytona 500. 
</P>
<P>
	The defending champion won his 10th straight 125-mile qualifying  
race at Daytona International Speedway on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The win puts The Intimidator fourth in the 43-car field, the  
same spot from which he won NASCAR's most prestigious event last 
February after 19 years of frustration. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll try his best to do it again on Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	``I plan on winning that race,'' said Earnhardt, who has a  
chance to become the first repeat winner since Sterling Marlin in 
1994-95. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Labonte won the first of the two qualifiers, boosting his  
stock as one of the favorites, along with 1997 Daytona champ and 
this year's pole-winner, Jeff Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, who showed some power of his own before getting ganged  
up on, locked up the No. 1 spot last Saturday with a lap of 195.067 
mph in the opening round of time trials that determined the lineups 
for Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	He led the first 39 laps of the opener, but Labonte and Ken  
Schrader worked together to push past coming off the backstretch on 
the 2 1/2-mile oval. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon's Chevrolet was able to retake second place on lap 48 but  
couldn't make a strong move on Labonte, finishing about three 
car-lengths behind the winning Pontiac. 
</P>
<P>
	``We learned that we have a great-handling race car,'' said  
Gordon, who did not seem disappointed by losing. ``It's tough to 
hold those guys off when it counts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte will start third in the Winston Cup season-opener.  
That's just behind Tony Stewart, his rookie teammate with Joe Gibbs 
Racing, owned by the former Washington Redskins coach who got a 
Daytona 500 victory with Dale Jarrett in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart earned his first Winston Cup start by finishing right  
behind Gordon in the first-day qualifying Saturday that determined 
only the front-row positions. 
</P>
<P>
	The 47-year-old Earnhardt, known for his aggressive driving and  
confident manner, needed just eight laps to get past Stewart, who 
started from the pole. After that, he was virtually unchallenged. 
</P>
<P>
	``The car was perfect,'' Earnhardt said. ``All week long, I kept  
telling my crew I don't know what to change. The car was so perfect 
I didn't want to mess anything up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-time series champion and winner of 71 races said he  
had set a goal of winning the qualifier to keep his streak perfect 
this decade. He has won 12 total. 
</P>
<P>
	``To win this race was sort of important to me,'' he said.  
``We've won them all in the '90s now and now we can put this to bed 
and worry about winning the Daytona 500 again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If he runs as well on Sunday, it may be no contest.  
</P>
<P>
	Each time the pack of Fords behind Earnhardt's Chevy attempted  
to make a move, the black No. 3 Monte Carlo was able to counter and 
take away momentum from his pursuers. 
</P>
<P>
	Any chance of catching Earnhardt disappeared halfway through the  
final lap when Jeremy Mayfield took second place from Dale Jarrett, 
running side-by-side through turns three and four as Earnhardt 
pulled away to a four car-length victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte, who finished second last year just ahead of Mayfield,  
thoroughly enjoyed his first-ever Daytona win, especially the way 
he got it. 
</P>
<P>
	Late in the first race, two-time defending Winston Cup champion  
Gordon tried to move alongside the leader several times but never 
made it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I used to always be the one getting blocked,'' Labonte said.  
``I said, 'This is going to be another school right here.' I'm not 
very good at it and I don't like blocking people. I guess it's what 
you've got to do, though.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He hopes to get another chance to perfect his new art in the  
200-lap race. 
</P>
<P>
	Other serious contenders include: two-time 500-winner Jarrett,  
Earnhardt's teammate Mike Skinner, Rusty Wallace, Jeff Burton, 
Schrader and Terry Labonte, Bobby's older brother. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton finished third in the opener, followed by Schrader,  
Martin, Jimmy Spencer, Michael Waltrip, Robert Pressley, Marlin and 
the elder Labonte. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second race, Jarrett, Wallace, Skinner and Stewart  
followed Earnhardt and Mayfield across the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
	The qualifying races determined positions 3-30, while 31-36 went  
to the remaining fastest drivers from time trials. Those that made 
it on speed included former 500 winner Ernie Irvan and Dave Marcis, 
who will start for a record 32nd consecutive time. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the drivers who had to revert to last year's car-owner  
points to make it into the rear of the field were: three-time 
Daytona 500 winner Bill Elliott; Johnny Benson, who failed to make 
last year's race; 1998 rookie of the year Kenny Irwin; and 
three-time Winston Cup champion and former Daytona winner Darrell 
Waltrip.

<HEADLINE>  Mourners Visit Kosovo Village </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RACAK, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Thousands of ethnic Albanians streamed  
into the Kosovo village of Racak today to bid farewell to 40 
villagers whose deaths last month generated international pressure 
to end the year-old war. 
</P>
<P>
	Elderly men with canes, weeping women and children accompanied  
the caskets, draped in red-and-black Albanian flags, up the snowy 
hill where they were laid in two long rows of graves. 
</P>
<P>
	The burials took place only a few hundred yards from where  
international peace monitors discovered the bodies on an adjacent 
hill on Jan. 16. William Walker, the American diplomat who heads 
the monitoring team, drew Serb wrath for accusing government forces 
that day of a massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	He told the mourners there was ``no justification for what  
happened here in Racak. The graves before me represent the madness, 
the waste, the futility of unrestrained violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to find something positive in killings, he said the  
deaths served as a catalyst for Kosovo peace talks -- continuing 
today at Rambouillet, France. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today the world will see your grief, but also images of  
hope,'' Walker said. ``Racak and Rambouillet are directly 
connected. We must not lose sight of this hope for a better 
future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Telegrams were read to the mourners from prominent ethnic  
Albanians. After speeches, the mourners had a minute of silence and 
shouted ``Lavdi!'' -- Glory! -- before filing silently away. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker had a brief encounter at the funeral with two Kosovo  
Liberation Army fighters, successfully ordering them to give up 
their automatic weapons. ``Put your arms down or I walk,'' he said. 
``A funeral is no place for weapons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The burials ended a weeks-long dispute over the bodies, which  
Serbian authorities insist were those of KLA fighters slain in 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities took the bodies from the mosque shortly after the  
slayings, insisting on autopsies to further their claim. They 
refused to give them up until Wednesday, saying Kosovo Albanians 
wanted to make a ``spectacle'' of their funeral while negotiations 
on the future of the separatist Serbian province were under way in 
France. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of those who flocked to Racak from surrounding villages  
today remained bitter over both the delay and the continuing 
violent standoff in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want the Kosovo issue to be solved through peaceful  
negotiations, but we also want our freedom,'' said Qerim Qorolli 
Rashince. 
</P>
<P>
	From early in the morning, people streamed down a snow-covered  
dirt road to the now-uninhabited village, where the coffins lay 
inside a small mosque before burial. Men of all ages, wearing 
skullcaps, queued up in front of the mosque to pay their final 
respects. 
</P>
<P>
	Villagers grimly recounted the events of Jan. 15, the day of the  
killings during a Serb police offensive in the area around the 
village 25 miles southwest of Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	Ihrije Jakupi, 52, lost her husband and 16-year-old son in the  
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Serbs locked the women in the cellar. They took the men up  
the hill behind the houses where Mr. Walker found them,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	They threatened to kill the women too, she said, if they didn't  
hand over any weapons they were keeping. 
</P>
<P>
	``The children were screaming,'' she said. ``They took my  
husband and my son and I never saw them again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shefki Nur Hyseni, 89, lost his only son, Haqif, who also left  
behind a wife and nine children. The family had been living in 
Racak since the grocery store they owned in nearby Stimlje was 
burned last July. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want my family to be strong and bear this grief,'' said the  
elderly Hyseni, who was away from the village on Jan. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	With 11 family members to take care of, he said, he has no idea  
how they can get by. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot provide for the basics,'' he said. ``There is no roof  
over our head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were no fresh reports of clashes today in the province,  
where more than 2,000 people have been killed since last February 
and some 300,000 driven from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations were under way for the release of two Serb  
policemen kidnapped near Mitrovica, 25 miles northwest of Pristina. 
The two, dressed in civilian clothes, were taken from their 
unmarked car Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The body of a man was found near the western town of Pec, shot  
in the head, the official Tanjug news agency reported. There was no 
word whether he was Serb or ethnic Albanian.

<HEADLINE> GM Introduces Monte Carlo 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- While its competition has cut back on coupes,  
Chevrolet is sticking with the declining market. The volume 
division of General Motors Corp. today introduced its 2000 Monte 
Carlo that goes on sale next fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's still coupe buyers out there who want an exciting  
brand,'' Chevrolet general manager Kurt Ritter said after the car 
was unveiled at the Chicago Auto Show's media preview. 
</P>
<P>
	The midsize Monte Carlo is the coupe version of the new Impala,  
which also shares its chassis and major mechanical parts with the 
Pontiac Grand Prix, Oldsmobile Intrigue and Buick Century and 
Regal. 
</P>
<P>
	The new version borrows a few styling cues from the original  
Monte Carlos of the 1970s, including a long hood, blunt rear end, 
vertical taillights and the return of the ``knight'' emblem. But 
the overall look is a departure from the current Lumina-based Monte 
Carlo. 
</P>
<P>
	Coupe sales have been down sharply this decade as buyers have  
flocked to sport utility vehicles and sedans. In the last few 
years, Ford Motor Co. eliminated the Thunderbird and Probe coupes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ritter said Chevy expects to sell 70,000 to 80,000 Monte Carlos  
a year, up from around 65,000 last year. That compares with plans 
to sell about 200,000 Impalas. The cars will be built at GM's 
Oshawa, Ontario, plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevrolet will target the Monte Carlo to drivers in their  
mid-30s to mid-40s. 
</P>
<P>
	Other new models introduced Wednesday at the Chicago show  
include the 2000 Pontiac Bonneville sedan, Nissan's 2000 Maxima 
sedan, Toyota's Camry Solara convertible and a new Toyota sports 
car. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota's MR-Spyder is a mid-engine, soft-top roadster that will  
give the Mazda Miata some competition in the $20,000 to $25,000 
price range. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement follows last month's strong indication by  
Nissan that it will revive an affordable Z-car in the next two 
years, and Honda's plan to introduce its S2000 roadster to the U.S. 
market next fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The MR-Spyder will replace the MR2, a hardtop sports car that  
remains on sale in Japan but was pulled from the North American 
market in 1995 because of slow sales. 
</P>
<P>
	It borrows some styling from its higher-priced competition: the  
circular fender flares look like they came off the new Audi TT, 
while the rear-end design looks a lot like the Porsche Boxster's, 
complete with big air scoops to cool the engine that rests behind 
the seats. 
</P>
<P>
	The car will be built in Japan, but executives would not say  
when it might go on sale there or Europe. Toyota said the 
production version will be very similar to the concept car. 
</P>
<P>
	The MR-Spyder will be powered by a new 1.8-liter, twin-cam,  
four-cylinder engine rated at 140 horsepower. It also features an 
unusual five-speed manual transmission that does not use a clutch. 
The driver can shift using a conventional center console shifter, 
or by pressing buttons on either side of the steering wheel. 
</P>
<P>
	The convertible Solara will be produced in Cambridge, Ontario,  
and go on sale in spring 2000. The convertible modification to the 
coupe will be done by ASC, which is opening a new plant near the 
Toyota factory. 
</P>
<P>
	It is aimed at buyers who desire both a sports car and the room  
and comfort of a larger car. It will be offered with a choice of 
four-cylinder or V6 engines, a standard four-speed automatic 
transmission, a power folding top and a glass rear window. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota expects to sell only 6,000 convertibles a year. The coupe  
went on sale last fall; Toyota plans to sell 50,000 this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan said its larger, more luxurious 2000 Maxima sedan will go  
on sale in June. The car comes with a more powerful 3-liter V6. The 
styling is less bland than that of the current generation Maxima, 
featuring more distinctive front- and rear-end treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Seergy, a Nissan vice president, said the car will be  
priced in the same low- to mid-$20,000 price range as the current 
model. He said Nissan expects to sell 110,000 Maximas a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pontiac division of General Motors Corp. unveiled its  
redesigned flagship sedan, the Bonneville, which executives 
described as a sporty luxury car ``with attitude.'' It shares its 
chassis and major mechanical parts with the Buick LeSabre. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Bonneville has Pontiac's styling trademarks, including  
``cat's eye'' headlights and lots of lower body cladding with 
sculpted ``gills'' to give it a more aggressive look. The car will 
come with a standard V6 engine that can be upgraded with a 
supercharger that boosts power to 240 horsepower from 205. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bonneville is aimed at baby boomer families who ``want a car  
that helps them look and feel young,'' said Mary Boland, Pontiac 
brand manager. The car will be produced at GM's Orion Township 
plant outside Detroit.

<HEADLINE> Navy Officer Blames Russian Laser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A U.S. naval intelligence officer says he may  
be losing sight in his right eye because of a laser beam that hit 
him as he flew over a Russian cargo ship. Russia denies the 
provocation and the Pentagon cannot verify it. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Jack Daly told a House Armed Services Committee hearing  
Thursday that he and the pilot of a Canadian surveillance 
helicopter suffered ``irreparable eye damage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daly said he remains convinced that the Russian vessel, the  
Kapitan Man, directed a laser beam at their helicopter on April 4, 
1997, in the Strait of Juan de Fuca north of Washington state's 
Puget Sound. 
</P>
<P>
	He also told lawmakers he is not surprised a U.S. Coast Guard  
and naval intelligence team could not find any laser device when it 
boarded the ship three days later in Tacoma, Wash. He said the 
Russian captain was given 24 hours warning of the search. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., chairman of the Armed Services  
procurement subcommittee, accused the Clinton administration of 
bureaucratic bungling in allowing the Russian captain to have so 
much advance notice. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter called for banning all Russian ships from Puget Sound and  
other waters close to submarine bases. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly, wearing glasses, testified that he had perfect vision  
before the incident. Now, he has 24-hour pain in his right eye, 
cannot drive at night and cannot go to the movies or night ball 
games in stadiums with bright lights. 
</P>
<P>
	The only relief he gets is sitting in the dark with his eyes  
closed, ``yet lately even that does not seem to help much,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly said he was photographing the Russian ship, which he  
suspected of spying on U.S. submarines, when the episode occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon investigated Daly's claims and concluded from  
medical examinations that the injuries to his eye were consistent 
with retinal damage from a low-power laser device. 
</P>
<P>
	But it said there was ``no evidence'' to prove it was a laser.  
No laser was found on the ship and the Russian captain denied 
having any such equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly cited documents showing that the State Department and the  
National Security Council had notified the Russian Embassy in 
Washington, D.C., about the episode -- and of the plan to board and 
search the ship at its dock in Tacoma. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian Embassy notified its consulate office in Seattle,  
which in turn notified the ship's captain, Daly said, ``providing 
almost 24 hours advance warning of the impending boarding and 
search.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter disclosed that the same Russian freighter had been  
boarded in 1993 by the Coast Guard -- and submarine surveillance 
equipment confiscated from it. 
</P>
<P>
	That should have been enough evidence that the cargo ship was  
engaged in spying as well as legitimate commerce, Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rear Admiral Lowell E. Jacoby, director of naval intelligence,  
did not dispute Daly's account of the alleged laser incident in his 
own testimony to the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's described the problem,'' Jacoby testified, noting that  
the Kapitan Man ``was being watched closely. It was a suspicious 
ship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said it and other Russian merchant ships had had ``numerous  
close encounters'' with Navy submarines in the Strait of Juan de 
Fuca. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly said that, on one frame of his film, a red light could be  
seen emanating from the ship. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that it has an orange rim within it, with a white spot  
at the center -- which he said was consistent with a laser beam 
rather than a ship's red navigation light 
</P>
<P>
	The testimony before the procurement subcommittee came at a  
hearing on what the military services are doing to protect the 
military from unconventional warfare, including laser attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO pilots and crew members were ordered to wear protective  
glasses in October after two American helicopter crew members 
sustained minor corneal burns, apparently from a laser pointed at 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Army Lt. Gen. Paul Kern told the subcommittee that protective  
eyewear is being issued to those who might be exposed to laser 
attacks, including pilots.

<HEADLINE> Man Defends Self in Dance Slaying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	XENIA, Ohio (AP) -- A man defending himself against capital  
murder charges drew looks of exasperation from prosecutors and 
legal advice from the judge during the first day of testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``Excuse me. I'm learning,'' James Taylor Sr. told the jury  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, 68, from the Dayton suburb of Huber Heights, is accused  
of gunning down a couple during a Valentine's Day dance a year ago. 
The couple had taken in Taylor's estranged wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor insisted on representing himself, even though prosecutors  
are seeking the death penalty. He has pleaded innocent and innocent 
by reason of insanity. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge told Taylor he would try to avoid interrupting his  
opening statement. But the judge interrupted Taylor anyway -- nine 
times -- to warn him about improper remarks and arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Steve Wolaver told the jury that Taylor became  
enraged that his wife, Pat Taylor, 63, left him and began living 
with Ronald Rihm, 51, and his wife, Carolyn Rihm, 57. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolaver said that on the night of the shooting, Taylor  
approached the table where his estranged wife and the Rihms were 
sitting and asked to speak to his wife, but she refused. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolaver said Taylor pulled out a gun and fired at his wife,  
missing her and striking a mirror. He then shot the Rihms and 
wounded another patron who tried to wrestle the gun away, Wolaver 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor told the jury he didn't go to the dance to shoot his  
wife. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went there that night to kill myself in front of my wife. My  
life has been so tore up,'' he said in a trembling voice. ``I love 
my wife.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tempers flared when Taylor attempted to cross-examine the  
prosecution's first witness. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry about what happened,'' Taylor told Lenora Rihm,  
Ronald Rihm's mother. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sorry doesn't count,'' she replied.  
</P>
<P>
	John Butz, one of Taylor's court-appointed lawyers who serves as  
``standby attorney,'' requested a mistrial, which was denied by the 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have seen in the flesh that Mr. Taylor cannot adequately  
present a case,'' Butz said. ``This is going to be a travesty.''

<HEADLINE> Rhodes Completes Coaching Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Ray Rhodes has completed his coaching  
staff in Green Bay with the hiring of quarterbacks coach Mike 
McCarthy, receivers coach Charlie Baggett and former player Lionel 
Washington as assistant secondary coach. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarthy, 35, was quarterbacks coach for the Kansas City Chiefs  
for the last four years and helped offensive coordinator Jimmy Raye 
in the team's game plans. He began his coaching career as a 
linebackers coach at Fort Hayes State in Kansas in 1987-88 before 
becoming an assistant at Southern Cal from 1989-92. 
</P>
<P>
	Baggett, 46, spent 14 seasons at Michigan State, his alma mater,  
including a 10-year tenure under George Perles from 1983-92 and the 
last four seasons under Nick Saban, making nine trips to bowl games 
along the way. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Perles, Baggett coached receivers and running backs,  
tutoring the receivers for seven years and the running backs for 
three seasons. He helped develop All-Americans Lorenzo White and 
Andre Rison plus NFL starters Mark Ingram and Courtney Hawkins. 
</P>
<P>
	After spending two years as receivers coach with the NFL's  
Houston Oilers from 1993-94, Baggett returned to Michigan State in 
1995, becoming associate head coach while continuing to work with 
the wide receivers. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the coaching staff includes Sherman Lewis, offensive  
coordinator; Emmitt Thomas, defensive coordinator; Larry Beightol, 
offensive line; Harry Sydney, running backs; Jeff Jagodzinski, 
tight ends; Ken Zampese, offensive assistant-quality control; Mike 
Trgovac, defensive line; Johnny Holland, linebackers; Joe Vitt, 
defensive secondary; Chuck Knox, Jr., defensive assistant-quality 
control; Steve Ortmayer, special teams; and Barry Rubin, strength 
and conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, general manager Ron Wolf confirmed the signings of  
receiver Bill Schroeder and defensive lineman Billy Lyon. The 
Packers also have signed linebacker Antonio London, who tore a knee 
ligament at practice Sept. 10 and missed the rest of the season.

<HEADLINE> Web Search Sites Sued Over Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Estee Lauder and Playboy Enterprises are aligned  
in a fight over their good names that could help chart the future 
of advertising on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	In separate lawsuits, the perfume maker and the publisher say  
Web sites are improperly selling the advertising that is displayed 
when someone types in the company's name to search for an Internet 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	Advertising linked to search words -- ``keywords'' in Internet  
parlance -- is a major source of revenue for Web sites, but the 
legality of using trademarked names hasn't been resolved in court. 
</P>
<P>
	Estee Lauder sued the Web search site Excite last month in  
federal court in New York city, saying that such ads infringe upon 
its trademark, foster unfair competition, and constitute false 
advertising. The suit seeks an injunction barring the ads. 
</P>
<P>
	On Excite's Web site, a computer user who types in words ``Estee  
Lauder'' gets a list of Web pages mentioning the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Also displayed: A big banner ad for the Fragrance Counter Inc.,  
a small online retailer of perfume and makeup. Fragrance Counter 
paid Excite for that ad, and for the link to Estee Lauder. 
</P>
<P>
	Playboy Enterprises sued Excite and Netscape last week in  
federal court in California and took its complaint a step further 
than Estee Lauder. Playboy said the sites ``hijacked and usurped'' 
its good name by linking it to ads for hard-core pornography sites 
that go way beyond the Playmate of the Month. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet companies and lawyers are anxiously watching the cases,  
which could set new precedents in the evolving world of cyberspace 
law. 
</P>
<P>
	``There could be major repercussions for Web companies trying to  
make money,'' said Drew Ianni, an online advertising analyst for 
the Internet research firm Jupiter Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	Keyword advertising sells for an average of $40 for every  
thousand times the ad is displayed. These ads now account for 
roughly 25 percent of online advertising revenues, which totaled $2 
billion in 1998, according to the Internet Advertising Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	Typically, a Web site will link generic words such ``car,'' to a  
Ford ad or ``recipes'' to a hot new cookbook. However, Ianni 
estimates about 5 percent of overall revenues come from sales of 
trademarked keywords. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier court decisions have generally given companies the right  
to an Internet address, using their trademarked name. That means if 
Estee Lauder wanted to list its Web site as www.esteelauder.com, it 
could. (The company opted instead for www.elcompanies.com.) 
</P>
<P>
	Keywords are the latest frontier. ``This is really the second  
generation of cyberspace law,'' said John T. Soma, a professor at 
the University of Denver's law school and a director of the 
Computer Law Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Some lawyers say Estee Lauder may be able to mount a strong case  
for its company name. But the cosmetics giant is also fighting to 
control the use of the words ``Clinique'' and ``Origins,'' two 
Lauder brand names also linked to Fragrance Counter. 
</P>
<P>
	``What if you typed in 'origins' looking for information on  
Charles Darwin?'' asked Gerald Jenkins, a Chicago lawyer. ``This 
case raises questions about whether the seller of a keyword will 
have to keep track of every possible use of that word.'' 
</P>
<P>
	None of the companies involved would comment on the suits.  
</P>
<P>
	Estee Lauder does get some benefit from the advertising. A small  
number of its products are for sale on The Fragrance Counter's Web 
site, at prices roughly equal to department-store prices. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, these newfangled cases may be decided on  
old-fashioned principles of trademark law. 
</P>
<P>
	Judges will need to determine whether consumers are confused by  
the ads, or whether the effectiveness of the companies' trademarks 
is being diluted. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they can show that that their name is being diluted by this  
use, they could have a pretty good case,'' said John Delaney, 
co-chairman of the new media practice at law firm Morrison &AMP; 
Foerster in New York.

<HEADLINE> Huskey Gets $1.5M Deal With Mariners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Outfielder Butch Huskey and the Seattle Mariners  
agreed Thursday to a $1.5 million, one-year contract, avoiding a 
salary arbitration hearing scheduled later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Huskey, who made $300,000 last year, had submitted a figure of  
$1,975,000 in arbitration and Seattle had offered $1.25 million. He 
was eligible for arbitration for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Huskey, 27, was obtained Dec. 14 from the New York Mets for  
pitching prospect Lesli Brea. In 113 games, Huskey hit .252 with 18 
doubles, 13 home runs and 59 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the Mariners' only player to file for arbitration last  
month. In addition to his base salary, Huskey would get a $50,000 
bonus if he has 580 plate appearances.

<HEADLINE> Rodriguez Back After Heart Attack  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The sword dance whenever he makes an important putt and the  
constant banter with the gallery are still part of the routine. Chi 
Chi Rodriguez is one of the most engaging personalities in golf, 
and not even a heart attack can get in the way of that. 
</P>
<P>
	The only changes in store for Rodriguez, who returns to the  
Senior PGA Tour this week in the American Express Invitational in 
Sarasota, Fla., are off the course. 
</P>
<P>
	No more cigarettes, which he gave up 16 months ago. A diet that  
allows him only about 3 ounces of red meat each week. And a new 
message for anyone who will listen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't be stubborn,'' Rodriguez said. ``Whenever you have pain  
or dizzy spells, get a stress test. Go see a doctor. Because the 
heart attack that I had could have been prevented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez is back on the tour for the first time since a heart  
attack on Oct. 13, which he says probably would have killed him if 
not for his brother insisting he go to a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez was working out that Tuesday morning before a practice  
round in the Raley's Gold Rush Classic. He routinely went 30 
minutes at 12 mph on the stationary bicycle, and he was playing 
well. A month earlier, his tie for fifth in the Comfort Classic was 
his best tournament of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	But when he got on the bike, he noticed something wrong.  
</P>
<P>
	``I had to stop because my stomach was killing me,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He took some antacid, got back on the bike and had to stop again  
after five minutes when he found it even more difficult to breathe 
and swallow. After a big breakfast -- Rodriguez loves food about as 
much as golf -- he finally agreed to see a doctor and couldn't 
believe what he heard. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Rodriguez, you're having a heart attack right now,'' the  
doctor told him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It scared me for the first time,'' Rodriguez said. ``Jim  
Anderson (his pilot) drove me to the hospital and a team of doctors 
was waiting to operate. If I had waited another 10 minutes, the 
doctor said I would have needed a heart transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	``They call it the widow-maker,'' he said. ``About 50 percent of  
the people who get this kind of heart attack die. So, I beat the 
odds pretty good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez has been doing that all his life. He learned the game  
in Puerto Rico by hitting tin cans with a guava tree stick, then 
worked as a caddie before joining the U.S. Army at 19. He joined 
the PGA Tour in 1960 and won eight times during his 21-year career, 
playing on one Ryder Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
	He left his mark on golf through his Chi Chi Rodriguez  
Foundation, which has raised more than $5 million, and on the 
Senior Tour, where he has become one of its most popular players 
even though he hasn't won since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would be a big void if he were gone,'' Larry Nelson said  
Thursday from the TPC at Prestancia. ``Last year, we missed him 
while he was gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez plans to play in only 18 tournaments this year as he  
slowly works himself into shape. He felt strong enough to play 27 
holes two weeks ago, but doesn't want to push it. He says he will 
treat golf even less seriously now, although he is very serious 
about his eating habits. 
</P>
<P>
	``My grandparents on both sides lived to be 100, and I figured I  
would live to be 100 without worrying about anything,'' Rodriguez 
said. ``But I was eating too much of the wrong stuff. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tell you what,'' he said. ``If you've got a good car, you  
better put good gas in it or you'll ruin it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez has lost 17 pounds and feels better than he has in  
years. His doctors told him the heart attack probably had been in 
the makings for as many as four years, and Rodriguez is thankful to 
have a chance to keep playing. 
</P>
<P>
	``In bed when I was almost dead, I found out about life,'' he  
said. ``Money doesn't mean anything. Your health is everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Rodriguez made one deathbed deal that he now finds hard to  
keep. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I ask God to do is to play golf with my friends. I  
couldn't care less about competing,'' he said. ``But now that I'm 
feeling better, I want to compete again.''

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Jury Finds Gun Makers Liable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal jury Thursday found several gun makers  
responsible in three area shootings for letting guns fall into the 
hands of criminals. Other manufacturers were cleared. 
</P>
<P>
	The only damages awarded were $560,000 to the sole survivor of  
the shootings, who was seriously wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Fox, 19, and the relatives of six homicide victims sued  
the gun industry in federal court in 1995. The class-action lawsuit 
sought unspecified damages from an industry that generates sales of 
$2 billion to $3 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Like some of the lawsuits brought against Big Tobacco, this one  
accused the gun industry of negligently marketing a legal product. 
The case also was closely watched by several cities trying to 
recover the costs of gun violence. 
</P>
<P>
	During the monthlong trial, the plaintiffs argued handgun makers  
oversupply gun-friendly markets, mainly in the South, aware that 
the excess guns flow into criminal hands via illegal markets in New 
York and other states with stricter anti-gun laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs' lawyers accused the 25 defendants of dumping  
handguns onto the black market like ``toxic waste,'' making no 
effort to identify and discipline dishonest distributors. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the defendants insisted their responsibility ends  
once they sell to licensed distributors. They said the job of 
policing traffickers should be left to the Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms, which has never required gun makers to track 
their products to the street. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry attorney James Dorr told the jury it was unfair to  
``hold the manufactures of a lawful, legitimately sold product 
responsible for acts of outlaws who are totally outside their 
control. ... The case is simply wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gun makers also asserted that in most of the shootings the  
plaintiffs never presented evidence conclusively linking the 
weapons used to harm their relatives to specific defendants. The 
plaintiffs countered that the ``chain of title'' is irrelevant, 
instead accusing the entire industry of creating a widespread risk 
with negligent marketing -- a concept known as collective liability. 
</P>
<P>
	``This huge pool (of handguns) is like toxic waste,'' the  
plaintiffs' attorney, Elisa Barnes, said in closing arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives for the victims testified, and attorneys presented  
statistics on weapons sales, the average age of guns used in 
crimes, and other aspects of the gun trade. 
</P>
<P>
	A key plaintiff witness, former Smith &AMP; Wesson Corp. executive  
Robert Hass, was too ill to appear but testified by deposition that 
gun makers took a see-no-evil approach to criminal use of their 
deadly products. And an economist testified that 90 percent of the 
handguns used in crimes in New York City in recent years came from 
southern states. 
</P>
<P>
	Testifying for the firearms industry, Chicago-based economics  
consultant Gustavo ``Chip'' Bamberger said plaintiffs' arguments 
about oversupply of guns relied on insufficient data and flawed 
statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	The verdict came despite apparent disagreement in the jury room.  
In recent days, jurors had sent U.S. District Court Judge Jack 
Weinstein several notes saying it was deadlocked. 
</P>
<P>
	One note said that 10 jurors had ``decided to work together to  
reach a verdict,'' but the 11th ``refused because he or she feels 
the verdict `will open the floodgate of lawsuits across the 
country.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Legal experts have said that it could set a precedent for cities  
trying to recoup the costs of battling gun violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago, New Orleans, Bridgeport, Conn. and Miami-Dade County  
are suing the industry. Pro-gun groups have responded by lobbying 
state legislatures to pass laws prohibiting such suits.

<HEADLINE> Kent Cooke Given Redskin Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- The Washington Redskins appeared on the  
verge of losing all their free agents and getting none to take 
their place. Then Paul Tagliabue stepped in. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours before the Thursday midnight deadline for the start of the  
free-agent signing period, the NFL commissioner intervened in a 
power struggle between the team's management and its interim owners 
and declared president John Kent Cooke in charge -- at least for 
now. 
</P>
<P>
	``Commissioner Tagliabue today confirmed that current Redskin  
management retains full authority to direct the operation of the 
team, including player and coach employment until the sale of the 
Redskins is approved by NFL clubs,'' a statement from the league 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The commissioner acted after learning that the special  
committee of the trustees for Jack Kent Cooke's estate recently 
denied management the authority to re-sign certain players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue's move was a relief to general manager Charley  
Casserly, whose hands had been tied at the bargaining table by the 
trustees. 
</P>
<P>
	He immediately got on the phone and reopened negotiations with  
quarterback Trent Green and cut disenchanted quarterback Gus 
Frerotte, saving the team a $1.25 million roster bonus that would 
have been due at the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
	``It means we have the go-ahead to operate,'' Casserly said.  
``We've done that. We've talked to Trent Green's agent. We'll be on 
the phone ... talking to other free agents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Casserly's future -- as well as that of everyone who works for  
the Redskins -- remains in limbo, however, as NFL owners consider 
whether to approve the sale of the team to a group headed by 
brothers Howard and Edward Milstein and Daniel Synder for a 
league-record $800 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The trustees of the late Cooke's estate agreed to sell the team  
to the Milstein-Snyder group on Jan. 10. Three-fourths of the NFL 
team owners must give their consent. 
</P>
<P>
	The buyers, trustees and many within the Redskins organization  
were hoping that approval would come at an owners' meeting next 
week in Atlanta, but that meeting was canceled Thursday. The next 
scheduled meeting of the full ownership is March 14-18 in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	Some owners have said they would have preferred that John Kent  
Cooke, Jack Kent Cooke's only surviving son, purchase the team. But 
the younger Cooke, who has represented the Redskins at league 
meetings for nearly 20 years, was not able to outbid Milstein and 
Snyder in a months-long action conducted by the trustees. 
</P>
<P>
	Signs of a tussle between the trustees and the Redskins  
management have been evident for days as the team made no progress 
in re-signing priority free agents Green, linebacker Marvcus 
Patton, receiver Leslie Shepherd and center Cory Raymer. The annual 
eve-of-free agency press conference with Casserly and coach Norv 
Turner was canceled Thursday with just two hours' notice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Under normal conditions, we could have reached a deal by  
midnight,'' said Glenn Schwartzmann, Shepherd's agent. ``They would 
have loved to be able to do that, but obviously the circumstances 
have been a little bit complicated.''

<HEADLINE> Coca-Cola, Pepsi Both See Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The two big guys in the soft drink industry got  
even bigger last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola Co. and Pepsi-Cola Co. each sold 4.5 percent more  
cases of soda pop last year than they did in 1997, outpacing the 
industry's expansion, according to separate reports Thursday by the 
trade publication Beverage Digest and the research concern Beverage 
Marketing Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Beverage Digest said overall industry sales rose 3.0 percent  
while Beverage Marketing pegged the growth at 3.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The growth meant Coca-Cola's entire portfolio of soft drinks  
accounted for 44.5 percent of the U.S. market in 1998, up 0.6 
percentage point from a year earlier, according to Beverage Digest. 
</P>
<P>
	Pepsi-Cola's brands grew 0.5 percentage point to 31.4 percent of  
the market, the trade publication said. 
</P>
<P>
	The other major soft drink companies either held steady or lost  
market share for the year, Beverage Digest said. 
</P>
<P>
	It estimated the value of U.S. carbonated soft drink sales at  
$56.3 billion in 1998, up from $54.7 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Among individual brands, Coca-Cola Classic was the leader even  
as it stayed steady at 20.6 percent of the market, while Pepsi-Cola 
was second at 14.2 percent, down 0.3 percentage point from last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Diet Coke was third at 8.6 percent of the market, up 0.1  
percentage point, and Mountain Dew was fourth at 6.7 percent, up 
0.4 percentage point. Sprite was fifth at 6.6 percent, also up 0.4 
percentage point. 
</P>
<P>
	Rounding out the top 10 brands were Dr Pepper at 6.1 percent,  
Diet Pepsi at 5.4 percent, 7Up at 2.1 percent, Caffeine-Free Diet 
Coke at 1.8 percent and Minute Maid at 1.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Minute Maid was the only newcomer on the top 10 brand list,  
displacing Caffeine-Free Diet Pepsi from last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Beverage Marketing had the same rankings but slightly different  
market shares.

<HEADLINE> Group Warns of Food Supply Clusters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Unless efforts are made to halt the pace of  
consolidation in agriculture, America's food chain will be 
controlled by a handful of corporations that will drive the 
independent family farmer to extinction, a farm group warned 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe concentration will do more to influence the future  
structure of agriculture in the United States than the next farm 
bill,'' Leland Swenson, president of the 300,000-member National 
Farmers Union told the House Agriculture Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many predict that we will soon have a system where three or  
four companies control the food and fiber system at every level, 
from the seed supply until the time it reaches the consumer,'' 
Swenson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's hearing was only the latest on the concentration  
issue. Concerns about the number of mergers in agriculture have 
risen since Cargill Inc. of Minneapolis, the nation's No. 1 grain 
company, announced plans in November to buy the worldwide 
operations of second-ranked Continental Grain Co. 
</P>
<P>
	With already low prices in both livestock and commodities  
markets, many lawmakers and farm groups worry that the 
Cargill-Continental deal, which is being reviewed by the Justice 
Department, will further depress prices for farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't continue to put the squeeze on those at the bottom of  
the production chain,'' said Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Harry L. Pearson, president of the Indiana Farm Bureau, said the  
American Farm Bureau also is concerned that concentration could 
lead to inadequate market access but has not taken a view on the 
Cargill-Continental deal. 
</P>
<P>
	But the National Farmers Union, which has called for a  
moratorium on mergers until the impact on agriculture is 
determined, painted a dimmer picture of what it calls ``the 
industrialization of agriculture'' with a study it released by a 
team of University of Missouri rural sociologists. 
</P>
<P>
	In the livestock industry, four large firms in each sector are  
slaughtering four out of five beef cattle; three out of four sheep; 
three out of five hogs and half of all chickens, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, 95 percent of all chickens are processed under  
production contracts -- a trend that concentration critics fear 
could stretch to other areas of livestock. 
</P>
<P>
	``The farmer becomes the grower, providing the labor and often  
some of the capital, but never owning the product as it moves 
through the food system and never making management decisions,'' 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also raised concerns about a ``seamless system''  
where companies control products from ``gene to shelf.'' Such 
clusters are already forming, the authors wrote, pointing to 
alliances between Monsanto, one of the leading biotechnology firms, 
with Cargill. 
</P>
<P>
	Another example of a major food chain player would be ConAgra,  
the report said, noting the company has subsidiaries along most 
links in the food chain. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Mark Drabenstott, an economist who heads the Center for  
the Study of Rural America at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas 
City, told lawmakers that consolidation in agriculture is 
``generally a positive trend'' that leads to lower priced and 
higher quality food for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Farmers face a simple test, build new relationships or be left  
out of the game,'' Drabenstott said.

<HEADLINE> Senators Near Vote on Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With acquittal assured, the Senate talked its  
way through a final full day of closed-door deliberations Thursday 
at President Clinton's impeachment trial, set for climactic 
noontime votes Friday in the case that one Democrat called ``this 
sordid saga.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine became the fourth Republican to  
declare her intention to vote to acquit on both charges, following 
the lead of other moderates who broke party ranks a day earlier. 
Several senators predicted that Susan Collins of Maine would be the 
fifth, although her office declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the chamber, where Chief Justice William Rehnquist  
presided, the talk was blunt at times. ``Over and over and over 
again, from both sides of the aisle,'' senators denounced the 
president as a liar, GOP Sen. Bob Bennett of Utah said later. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett predicted that Clinton would go down in history as ``the  
most accomplished polished liar we've ever had in the White 
House.'' The very name ``Clinton,'' he forecast, will become part 
of the lexicon as ``a synonym for an elegant, well-crafted lie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A two-thirds vote is required to convict the president and  
remove him from office, and there was no chance of that happening. 
Instead, whatever suspense lingered at the end of the five-week 
trial was whether either article of impeachment would attain a bare 
majority -- a psychological threshold that had no bearing on 
Clinton's fate. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have a 55-45 majority in the Senate.  
</P>
<P>
	A steady stream of lawmakers came forward Thursday to announce  
their intentions for the roll calls on perjury and obstruction of 
justice, dividing largely along party lines on presidential guilt 
or innocence but offering nonpartisan condemnations of Clinton's 
behavior with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my heart and in my mind, I believe to a moral certainty  
that my verdict is just,'' Snowe declared in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``There can be no doubt that President Clinton's conduct has  
made a mockery of most of his words, or that his example has been 
corrosive beyond calculation to our culture and to our children,'' 
said Oregon Republican Gordon Smith, who said he would vote to 
convict. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one, not any senator in this chamber nor any person in this  
country, will look at this president in the same way again,'' said 
Democrat Dick Durbin of Illinois, who said he would vote for 
acquittal on both charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Lieberman said he had concluded that Clinton's  
``wrongdoing in this sordid saga does not justify making him the 
first president to be ousted from office in our history.'' The 
Connecticut Democrat had commanded nationwide attention last 
September with highly critical words about Clinton's behavior at a 
time the White House still hoped to avoid congressional action. 
</P>
<P>
	For all the expressions of disgust, a formal effort to censure  
the president appeared all but dead, a victim of Republican 
opposition. Democrats said they would make an effort to force a 
post-trial vote on the Senate floor, and failing passage, would 
draft a statement of condemnation. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Republicans, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, John Chafee of  
Rhode Island and James Jeffords of Vermont, announced on Wednesday 
they would not vote for conviction on either article. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Slade Gorton of Washington has announced he will vote  
against the perjury charge, but in favor of the obstruction charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Collins, like Snowe a moderate Republican from Maine, has  
yet to disclose her decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Another moderate, Smith from Oregon, stepped forward during the  
day to say he would vote for conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	``I refuse to say that high political polls and soaring Wall  
Street indexes give license to those in high places who act in low 
and illegal ways,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Democrats, Senate aides said the only question was whether  
Robert C., Byrd of West Virginia, a longtime party leader, would 
break ranks and join Republicans in voting to convict. 
</P>
<P>
	Controversy broke out over a report that Clinton had vowed  
revenge on House Republicans at the polls in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is deeply troubling that the president views closure of  
this constitutional process as an opportunity for revenge,'' said 
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart didn't deny presidential  
anger, but said, ``I can't think of a worse, more dumb strategy 
than going after people based on whether they were a House manager 
or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You look at the House managers and the vast majority are in  
safe seats or unopposed seats,'' he said. The 2000 election is 21 
months distant, and Clinton has promised a strenuous effort to help 
Democrats regain control of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial had only a few hours to run.  
</P>
<P>
	Chief Justice William Rehnquist made the trip from the Supreme  
Court in his limousine Thursday, as he has for each session since 
the trial began on Jan. 8, and a few moments later the Senate's 
doors were closed for deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
	At the start of the day, the third devoted to private  
deliberations, Lott said 37 senators had yet to speak, each given 
15 minutes under 19th century Senate impeachment rules. Senators 
are prohibited upon pain of expulsion from disclosing what was 
said, and few details emerged. 
</P>
<P>
	But several senators issued written statements during the day.  
</P>
<P>
	``The House managers failed to establish that the president's  
conduct amounts to 'high crimes and misdemeanors,''' said Sen. Jack 
Reed of Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Wayne Allard, R-Colo., saw the case otherwise. ``When  
President Clinton chose not to 'tell the truth, the whole truth and 
nothing but the truth,' he put himself above the law. He violated 
his oath and undermined the rule of law which he had sworn to 
uphold.''

<HEADLINE>  Lack of Money Might Still Doom Mir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's Mir space station might be discarded as  
early as August because investors who were supposedly planning to 
fund it have backed out, the nation's space chief said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The RKK Energia company, which built and runs the 13-year old  
station, said in December that it had found a private sponsor to 
keep Mir in orbit for another three years. The station was 
scheduled to be scrapped in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just wishful thinking,'' Space Agency director Yuri  
Koptev said of Energia's statement. ``They have indeed carried out 
serious work with an investor who had the money. But the investor 
has some problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shutting down Mir is favored by NASA, which wants Moscow to  
forget about Mir and dedicate its meager resources to the 
international space station. The 16-nation project is a year behind 
schedule because Russia didn't build an early component on time. 
The station's first elements were launched late last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov decreed that Energia  
could keep the Mir in operation for another three years, but only 
if private investors paid the station's yearly expenses of up to 
$250 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Primakov's decision was praised by Russia's space officials, who  
had insisted that the much-loved Mir stay in orbit, even though the 
government didn't have enough money to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the loss of the mysterious private investor, the  
station once again looks as if it will be abandoned this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``If no investor is found, we will be forced to make the tough  
decision to discard Mir in August or September,'' Koptev said at a 
news conference following a Cabinet session in which this year's 
space program was discussed. 
</P>
<P>
	He said space officials would start planning to abandon Mir if  
no money is found by April. 
</P>
<P>
	Koptev refused to name prospective investors, but denied Russian  
media reports that they could be Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
	``China has been energetically developing its own space program  
and promised to put its first astronaut in orbit by Oct. 1 this 
year,'' he said. ``If they had been interested in flying on our 
station, they would have done it a long time ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two Chinese pilots have undergone preparation at Russia's  
cosmonaut training center, but cooperation stopped there. ``We 
haven't heard from them since then,'' Koptev said. 
</P>
<P>
	Koptev also said the launch of a service module expected to  
house the international space station's first crew could also be 
delayed. Its blast-off date has been pushed back repeatedly and is 
currently set for July. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may be July, or August, or September if we encounter some  
problems,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> La. Gov. Wants To Shield Gunmakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Less than a day after Georgia became the  
first state to shield gun makers from product liability lawsuits by 
cities and counties, Louisiana's governor said he supports such a 
ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Mike Foster on Wednesday threw his backing behind a bill  
that would block a New Orleans lawsuit seeking damages from gun 
manufacturers for the costs of gun violence. The bill Georgia Gov. 
Roy Barnes signed Tuesday was meant to block a similar case by 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``Georgia had no problem with it,'' Foster said while speaking  
to a civic club in Baton Rouge. ``And we, in Louisiana, believe in 
2nd Amendment rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans Mayor Marc Morial criticized Foster's decision,  
saying the bill ``is a sad sellout to the money and power of the 
gun lobby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill's sponsor is Rep. Steve Scalise, who plans to run for  
the seat of outgoing U.S. Rep. Bob Livingston. He said the goal is 
to protect gun store owners from the cost of defending lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the criminals, not the small businesses, that must accept  
responsibility when they pull the trigger,'' Scalise said. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster's announcement came a day after Morial suspended a  
controversial gun swap deal between New Orleans and Glock Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of paying $630,300 for 1,700 new pistols, New Orleans  
agreed to give the Smyrna, Ga.-based company old police pistols and 
thousands of confiscated guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Morial suspended the contract, citing reports that some of the  
weapons may have resurfaced in Louisiana, which would violate the 
contract.

<HEADLINE> Cable Channel Seeks Female Audience </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The idea that men love to watch sports is the  
cornerstone of many of television's brawniest efforts to increase 
viewership. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox has been no slouch in this department. Fox Broadcasting  
ponied up for a $4.4 billion NFL contract. Fox-Liberty Networks was 
formed to launch Fox Sports Net, a challenger to ESPN. And cable 
channel FX features sports as well as series. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is a tiny corner of the Fox empire dedicated to the  
idea that women viewers also are worth cultivating. 
</P>
<P>
	Fit tv, a Fox-Liberty cable channel launched in January, takes  
the approach that women don't just want to watch, they want to do -- 
and they want television to do something for them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fit tv courts women in a very positive way,'' said Pyper  
Davis, its president. ``It's not a weepy, sad, 'Your husband slept 
with six of your neighbors and then married your sister''' kind of 
programming that has traditionally targeted women. 
</P>
<P>
	Fit tv is a makeover of an existing cable venture that was  
purchased by Fox-Liberty. Founded by fitness pro Jake Steinfeld, it 
essentially was a round-the-clock workout channel, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've taken the concept of fitness and broadened it and  
deepened it, to make it an overall fit and healthy lifestyle,'' she 
said. Fit tv stresses physical, mental, emotional and spiritual 
fitness. 
</P>
<P>
	And fiscal. And fashion, of course. Why stop short?  
</P>
<P>
	Sounds like a heavy load for a mere TV channel to take on. Yet  
fit tv's agenda is no different from a number of health and fitness 
magazines aimed at women, such as Self and Shape. 
</P>
<P>
	If a magazine can promote itself as a life-changing experience,  
why should TV be shy about doing the same? The bigger question is 
why it took someone so long to recognize the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it got missed,'' said Davis. There are pockets of such  
programming on broadcast and cable, she said, but fit tv has the 
chance to break new ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The channel is doing so, at first, with traditional-looking  
programs. The anchor show is the half-hour ``Fit Resort &AMP; Spa,'' 
which Davis describes as loosely modeled on the ``Today'' format. 
</P>
<P>
	With hosts Mark Goodman and Andi Matheny, ``Fit Resort &AMP; Spa''  
promises viewers advice on topics including health, beauty and 
relationships. It also aims to uncover the offbeat, including such 
treatments as hot wood and oxygen purification. 
</P>
<P>
	Also part of the fit tv lineup:  
</P>
<P>
	-- ``Fitting It In,'' which demonstrates how to fix a healthy  
meal and complete a 25-minute workout within the same hour. 
</P>
<P>
	-- ``Yoga Zone,'' a 30-minute session set in Jamaica and led by  
yoga expert Allan Finger. 
</P>
<P>
	-- ``American Health &AMP; Fitness,'' with fitness pro Clark Bartram,  
promises the latest information on nutrition and exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	-- ``Bodies in Motion,'' with Israeli decathlon champion Gilad  
Janklowicz, is a half-hour workout that promises to transform the 
latest workouts into ``easy, do-it-yourself'' routines. 
</P>
<P>
	-- ``Forever Young With Bill Frank'' is geared toward Baby  
Boomers and features Hollywood trainer Frank. Besides diet, 
exercise and grooming tips, the program looks at topics such as 
making life more adventurous. 
</P>
<P>
	In a nod to its history, fit tv also offers ``PowerLiving by  
Jake,'' with Steinfeld as host of a half-hour show featuring 
celebrity interviews, visits with fitness-oriented folk and music. 
</P>
<P>
	The channel reaches about 10 million homes, Davis said. Snippets  
also can be seen weekdays on sister channels FX (from 6 a.m.-7 a.m. 
local time) and on Fox Sports Net (from 8:30 a.m.-9:30 a.m. local 
time). 
</P>
<P>
	Fit tv is not alone in seeing opportunity in cable TV, which  
until now has let Lifetime carry the ball for women. Another 
channel, Oxygen, which includes Oprah Winfrey as one of its 
backers, plans to debut Jan. 1, 2000, with series, movies and 
personal and business advice shows tailored for women. 
</P>
<P>
	Such ventures represent opportunities for female viewers -- and  
for female executives. Davis, who helped launch Fox Sports Net 
before turning to fit tv, is reveling in bringing the channel to 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand better now how the ultimate male dream is to work  
for a TV sports network, because it's intuitive programming. Fit tv 
is intuitive programming. It's programming for people like me and 
for many other women I know, whether mothers or working women, in 
their 20s or 50s,'' she said. ``It's fun.'' 
</P>

	SEA TALE: On Jan. 14, 1909, a ship carrying immigrants to New  
York collided off Nantucket Island with a European-bound ship

<HEADLINE> Broken wrist Ends Okey's Career </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) -- Sam Okey's already brief basketball  
career at Iowa has been cut even shorter. 
</P>
<P>
	Okey, who became eligible in late January, will miss the rest of  
the season because of a broken right wrist, the school said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-7 senior injured the wrist Wednesday night in a fall  
under the Iowa basket in the second half of a 76-73 victory over 
Minnesota. X-rays on Thursday revealed the fracture. 
</P>
<P>
	Okey played in only seven games for the Hawkeyes, averaging 6.6  
points and 3.1 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sam was a great addition to our team, both on and off the  
court, for the short time he was able to play,'' Iowa coach Tom 
Davis said in a statement released by the university. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry his playing time at Iowa was so brief,'' Davis said.  
``We'll all miss having him with us the remainder of the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Okey, who's from Cassville, Wis., transferred to Iowa from  
Wisconsin in January 1998. He had the option of sitting out this 
season and playing all next season or playing just the second 
semester this season. 
</P>
<P>
	After choosing the latter, he first played on Jan. 21 after  
being cleared by athletic director Bob Bowlsby. Bowlsby had been 
monitoring Okey's behavior after Okey pleaded guilty to a drunken 
driving charge last spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Okey, the Big Ten freshman of the year in 1996, also had two  
run-ins with the law while at Wisconsin. He left the Badgers after 
a disagreement with coach Dick Bennett.

<HEADLINE> Terps' Ekezie Has Tendon Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Maryland center Obinna Ekezie's torn tendon was  
successfully repaired Thursday, though his recovery will keep him 
off the court the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Ekezie, a 6-foot-10 senior, ruptured the Achilles' tendon in his  
left heel late in Tuesday's practice. The injury effectively ends 
his career at Maryland as doctors said Ekezie won't be able to 
resume playing for five or six months. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect a full recovery and that Obinna will be able to  
return to basketball at his previous level of play in the future,'' 
Dr. Leigh Ann Curl, a surgeon at the University of Maryland Medical 
Center, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The 45-minute procedure was performed at Kernan Hospital, an  
orthopedic rehabilitation facility owned by the University of 
Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	Ekezie was averaging 12.7 points and 5.9 rebounds this season.  
He started 87 straight games for the seventh-ranked Terrapins 
(21-4) before being replaced in the starting lineup by freshman 
Lonny Baxter against Virginia on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Nigeria, Ekezie currently ranks fourth on the team  
in scoring and is second in rebounding and blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he never played basketball before coming to the United  
States before his senior year of high school, Ekezie was the 34th 
player in school history to score 1,000 points, finishing with 
1,172. 
</P>
<P>
	He is one of only four Terrapins to record 1,000 points, 600  
rebounds and 100 blocked shots.

<HEADLINE>  Argentina 1, Mexico 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Defender Juan Sorin scored in the 67th minute  
as Argentina disappointed a record soccer crowd of 91,585 at the 
Coliseum with a 1-0 victory over Mexico in an exhibition match 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	On a sequence beginning with a free kick, Guillermo Barros  
Schellotto drove to the goal from the left side, drawing Mexican 
goalkeeper Jorge Campos toward him. Campos deflected Schellotto's 
pass, but an onrushing Sorin put a diving header into the unguarded 
net. 
</P>
<P>
	Lethargic for most of the match played in front of the heavily  
pro-Mexico crowd, the Mexican team increased the fervor of its 
attack following the goal. Juan Manuel Abundis' 76th-minute shot 
barely went wide of the net while his 83rd-minute shot hit the 
crossbar. 
</P>
<P>
	Luis Hernandez' 79th-minute shot eluded goalkeeper German  
Burgos, but was cleared away by defender Claudio Husain. 
</P>
<P>
	Sergio Almaguer and Francisco Palencia took Mexico's final shots  
in the 84th and 90th minutes, with both going wide of the goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Argentina had the match's first credible scoring chance in the  
56th minute. Martin Palmero dribbled passed Mexico's defense, but 
his shot from inside the penalty area sailed over the goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Players from each team drew yellow cards during an uneventful  
first half -- Mexican defender Claudio Suarez in the 13th minute and 
Argentinean defender Eduardo Berizzo in the 22nd. 
</P>
<P>
	A closed-circut telecast of the match was aired at the adjacent  
Sports Arena to approximately 1,000 fans who were unable to be 
seated at the sold-out Coliseum.

<HEADLINE>  Shaq Out With Abdominal Strain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The Los Angeles Lakers were without Shaquille  
O'Neal because of a strained abdominal muscle in an 86-75 loss at 
Minnesota, but O'Neal says he'll b back Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal, who missed 21 games with a similar ailment last season,  
sustained the injury during Wednesday's win over Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to take tonight off and then rehab it the next couple  
of days and come back Sunday,'' O'Neal said. ``It's just kind of 
sore. I don't want to push it. I'm not worried. I didn't treat it 
last year, I just rested. I'm treating it this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal had 29 points in the win over the Nuggets, but only one  
in the fourth quarter. He is averaging 30.5 points, second in the 
NBA, and 12.3 rebounds through the Lakers' first four games. 
</P>
<P>
	Without him Thursday, the Lakers shot just 33.3 percent and came  
within one point of matching the lowest-scoring game in franchise 
history. The Lakers' starters hit just 28.5 percent of their shots, 
and Elden Campbell, O'Neal's replacement, was 2-for-10. 
</P>
<P>
	``You lose the most dominant player, you don't replace a guy  
like that,'' said backup guard Derek Harper. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal was to be re-evaluated Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	Before the game, coach Del Harris sounded as though he might be  
preparing to be without his All-Star center for more than one game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're fortunate that we have Elden, who is such an effective  
low-post player,'' Harris said. ``(Campbell and O'Neal) still 
haven't been effective playing together, but they've been effective 
individually.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell, who has been unhappy with his backup role, is  
averaging 6.4 points and 6.4 rebounds. Harris also referred to 
little-used backup Sean Rooks as perhaps the best third-string 
center in the league; Rooks had four points and no rebounds in 14 
minutes Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got three legitimate low-post centers who have game,''  
Harris said. ``So it could be worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal has missed significant time each of the last three  
seasons. He played 54 games with Orlando in 1995-96, 51 in his 
first season with the Lakers and 60 last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers were 15-7 last season in games O'Neal missed (he sat  
out one because of a suspension). They were 46-14 in the regular 
season when he played. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like we don't still have a good team,'' Harris said.  
``You've got to believe you can win. If our guys believe we can win 
without him we'll be OK.''

<HEADLINE> Wilson's Campaign Debts Piling Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Former Gov. Pete Wilson is adding more  
debt to bills still unpaid from his presidential campaign four 
years ago as he tries to bring in cash for a second White House 
run. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican's latest campaign finance statements show his  
principal presidential campaign organization -- a remnant of the 
earlier bid -- is $347,691 in debt, up nearly $47,000 from a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson piled up the new bills by meeting with political  
consultants, traveling and paying for direct mail during his last 
year as governor here. 
</P>
<P>
	His three federal campaign committees had a total of $377,305 in  
the bank as of Dec. 31 -- a mere fraction of the $20 million to $25 
million Wilson figures it will cost to compete in the GOP 
presidential primary campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson has said he must decide whether he will enter the race by  
this spring. And with the first primary about a year away, Wilson's 
dearth of cash raises questions as to whether he can finance a 
national race. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can certainly extinguish any doubts by raising an enormous  
amount of money in a short amount of time,'' said John Pavia, a 
political aide to 1996 GOP nominee Bob Dole. ``But to take a look 
at his balance sheet right now, anyone looking to get behind a 
presidential candidate would have to be a little bit concerned 
about Pete Wilson's financial status.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some in Wilson's camp see it differently.  
</P>
<P>
	``If he runs, he will run debt-free,'' said longtime associate  
Sean Walsh, who was Wilson's gubernatorial spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson's debt is not unusual, and it has shrunk from the more  
than $2 million he reported at the close of his first campaign.

<HEADLINE> Cards Make Moore Franchise Player </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- The Arizona Cardinals didn't want to let  
Jamir Miller get away. They also didn't want to drive him off. 
</P>
<P>
	So they made wide receiver Rob Moore their franchise player on  
the eve of free agency and gambled on being able to re-sign Miller. 
The Cardinals believe the 6-foot-5, 260-pound outside linebacker 
wants to return to the team that drafted him in the first round in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Cardinals have a very good thing going,'' agent Steve  
Baker said Thursday. ``You're talking about a team that has more 
young defensive talent than any team in the league. You're talking 
a grass field. It's a very exciting situation. If Jamir wasn't a 
Cardinal, it would be a team he'd seriously look at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moore is guaranteed the average salary of the top five players  
at his position ($3.53 million). 
</P>
<P>
	Miller's cost would have been $3.48 million, but the long-term  
effects of limiting his salary could have been serious. 
</P>
<P>
	``All that would have done is delay him being signed until late  
summer. Now hopefully we'll get the deal done very quickly,'' Baker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller played for $710,000 last season and led the Cardinals  
with a career-high 150 tackles despite having a dislocated wrist 
most of the time. For that kind of grit, he expects something 
similar to the $6.5 million average over three years that the 
Baltimore Ravens gave Ray Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Giving Moore, who played for $2.95 million last year, the  
franchise tag was less risky. 
</P>
<P>
	He likely will settle in the $4 million to $5 million a year  
range to stay in an offense that got better all season as he and 
Frank Sanders got used to second-year quarterback Jake Plummer. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders had a career-high 89 catches for 1,145 yards, and Moore  
had 67 for 982 one year after setting career marks for catches (97) 
and yardage (1,584). The Cardinals expect to lose Eric Metcalf, 
their No. 3 wide receiver, during the offseason, and Cleveland took 
Fred Brock, another receiver, in the expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals will pay Plummer $29.7 million over the next four  
seasons, an investment that means they probably won't be able to 
afford to bring back one of their two other top free agents -- left 
tackle Lomas Brown and free safety Kwamie Lassiter. 
</P>
<P>
	They tendered offers to 17 players with expired contracts,  
including tight ends Johnny McWilliams, Terry Hardy and Jarius 
Hayes, and wide receiver Chad Carpenter.

<HEADLINE> IMF Likes Hong Kong Economic Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Hong Kong's economic recovery could begin late  
this year, the International Monetary Fund said in a government 
report released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF directors also praised Hong Kong for continuing to keep its  
currency linked with the U.S. dollar at a stable rate, but it 
advised the government against repeating last year's massive 
intervention in stock markets, which was aimed at driving out 
speculators. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF made the comments in a public notice that followed its  
annual meeting with China in January. IMF officials have held 
consultations with China regarding Hong Kong every year since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite solid economic fundamentals, Hong Kong was not immune to  
the financial havoc brought about by the Asian financial crisis -- 
and the territory's record-high unemployment was proof of that, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	With the gradual decline of asset prices, labor costs, and  
inflation, economic recovery in Hong Kong ``could begin to emerge 
in the second half of the year,'' the IMF said in the government 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hong Kong has made substantial economic adjustments over the  
past year. We are pleased with the IMF's positve assessment,'' the 
report quoted Financial Secretary Donald Tsang as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hong Kong government has come under fire for doing too  
little, too slowly to address unemployment, which has risen to a 
record 5.8 percent, plunging property values, and falling retail 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF commended the government's resolve to hold fast its  
15-year peg linking the Hong Kong dollar at a stable rate to the 
U.S. dollar, saying the fixed exchange rate ``contributed 
significantly to financial stability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the IMF directors stopped short of a granting a ringing  
endorsement of the Hong Kong government's decision last year to 
intervene in local markets to dislodge speculators. 
</P>
<P>
	In a two-week period in August, the government spent the  
equivalent of $15.1 billion to buy shares in all 33 stocks that 
make up the blue-chip Hang Seng Index. The holdings included stakes 
of more than 10 percent in three big companies. The government 
later introduced a series of regulations to restrict speculative 
activity and stabilize the markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hong Kong government ``should refrain form further  
intervention in equity markets ...'' the report said.

<HEADLINE>  Greenspan Favors GOP Bank Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan waded  
into this year's debate on overhauling the nation's financial 
services laws, brushing aside concerns that encouraging the 
creation of one-stop shopping would bring a dangerous concentration 
of economic power. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time Thursday, Greenspan extended his public  
disagreement with the Clinton administration over the best approach 
to take to change the laws governing banks, brokerage firms and 
insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed chief testified as Congress began the latest round of  
debate on legislation to remove the Depression-era barriers between 
those industries. 
</P>
<P>
	At a House Banking Committee hearing, Greenspan endorsed a bill  
proposed by committee Chairman Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, that would 
lift the barriers and give the Fed more power over new financial 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar legislation to let banks, brokerages and insurers merge  
and get more deeply into each other's businesses died in Congress 
last year after coming closer to passage than in many years. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say such an overhaul is needed to keep the U.S.  
industry competitive in a fast-changing world and to cut costs for 
American consumers, who spend an estimated $300 billion a year on 
financial services. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, a parade of officials from Wall Street, banks and  
insurance firms -- all of which have spent millions of lobbying 
dollars on the issue -- urged Congress to enact legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	But opponents, including several consumer groups and activist  
Ralph Nader, contend it could bring more megamergers and 
concentrate economic power in a few hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Leach's bill ``is not a bill for consumers,'' Nader testified  
Thursday. ``It is a bill designed to create new profit centers for 
a relative handful of banking and financial services corporations. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing with Nader were representatives of Consumers Union,  
U.S. Public Interest Research Group, the National Community 
Reinvestment Coalition and the Center for Community Change. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, in response to questions from Rep. Bernard Sanders of  
Vermont, Congress' lone independent, Greenspan said he didn't share 
those concerns because technology has brought ``a major increase in 
competitive pressures throughout this economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While acknowledging there are some ``extraordinarily wealthy  
billionaires'' in this country, Greenspan said that's the result of 
soaring stock prices, not corporate mergers. Many mergers actually 
haven't worked very well, he maintained. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of the legislation worry that mergers creating financial  
conglomerates -- such as the recent marriage of banking giant 
Citicorp and the Travelers Group insurance-brokerage company -- will 
encourage a ``too big to be allowed to fail'' doctrine leading to 
government bailouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan did express concern over rising bank fees to  
consumers, which critics believe have been pushed higher by bank 
mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an ongoing process (for regulators) ... to make sure that  
banks maintain appropriate services to their customers,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's endorsement of a key Republican lawmaker's bill put  
him at odds again with the administration's top economic 
policymaker, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
	Both men support revamping the laws but have taken different  
approaches in a regulatory turf battle. 
</P>
<P>
	Leach's bill ``has chosen the appropriate structure to combine  
banking, securities and insurance firms (by) using financial 
service holding companies,'' Greenspan testified. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the administration threw its support behind a new,  
competing bill by Rep. John LaFalce of New York, the Banking 
Committee's senior Democrat. That would lift the barriers among 
financial industries, but preserve the split regulatory authority 
between the Treasury Department and the Fed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury, represented by Rubin, and the central bank,  
represented by Greenspan, have long been at odds over how to 
overhaul the existing Depression-era legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration wants to let banks diversify through  
subsidiaries of the bank itself, not just through affiliated 
companies within the same parent holding company. That arrangement 
would increase the power of the Treasury's Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency, regulator of nationally chartered 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side of the battle, the proposal to let banks into  
other kinds of financial activities through a holding company would 
expand the Fed's role in regulating.

<HEADLINE> Unabomber Lands a Book Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Unabomber Theodore J. Kaczynski has landed a  
book deal to tell his story and will give the proceeds to his 
victims' families, the publisher said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Truth Versus Lies'' will be ``an attempt to tell the other  
side of a one-sided tale that was spun by his family and his 
attorneys in their attempt to save him from the death penalty,'' 
said Beau Friedlander, publisher of Context Media. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaczynski is serving a life sentence for 16 bomb attacks that  
killed three people and wounded 29. He pleaded guilty last year in 
Sacramento, Calif., to avoid the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of that deal, he also agreed to turn over any future  
earnings to the victims' families. He is receiving no advance 
payment, 
</P>
<P>
	After Kaczynski tried unsuccessfully last year to pitch a book  
to more established New York publishers, including Simon &AMP; 
Schuster, Friedlander wrote to the former mathematics professor in 
prison and expressed interest in publishing the book. He said he 
received a 548-page manuscript from Kaczynski last fall and plans 
to publish the book in late May or June. 
</P>
<P>
	The publisher declined to release an advance copy, saying he is  
still shopping it around for possible serialization by a magazine 
or newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaczynski previously wrote a 35,000-word anti-technology  
manifesto that was published by The Washington Post and The New 
York Times in 1995. His brother, David, noticed similarities to 
Kaczynski's writings and turned him in. 
</P>
<P>
	David Kaczynski got a $1 million government reward and has set  
up a fund to distribute about $500,000 to victims of crimes 
committed by people like his brother who are paranoid 
schizophrenics. 
</P>
<P>
	Friedlander said Kaczynski ``is earnest about discovering his  
brother's true motivations for turning him over to the FBI. 
Kaczynski spares no details, even when they show him in a less 
favorable light.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Context Media also is releasing a book this spring by Michael  
Mello, a Vermont law professor who has exchanged letters with 
Kaczynski since July. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaczynski believes he was unfairly coerced into pleading guilty  
and has hired a new lawyer to help him win a second trial, 
according to Mello.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Tries To Contain Listeriosis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Recent outbreaks of listeriosis are causing an  
immediate public health problem, federal agriculture officials said 
in launching a review of whether to require more testing for the 
deadly bacterium. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Agriculture Department officials said they would like more  
legal authority to focus on the danger to public health when they 
recommend recalls, so they can warn the public faster. 
</P>
<P>
	At a daylong public meeting on Wednesday, officials said they  
had more questions than answers about a spike in outbreaks of 
listeriosis like the one traced to hot dogs and cold cuts at 
Michigan's Bil Mar Foods plant in December that has killed 16 
people and sickened more than 70 in 14 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Listeria monocytogenes is a bacteria that healthy people usually  
fight off but sometimes can kill. Pregnant women, the newborn, 
older adults and people with weakened immune systems are especially 
at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because we have an immediate public health problem, our first  
goal is to establish an immediate action plan to address 
improvements in the control of listeria,'' said Thomas Billy, 
administrator of USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Farther ahead, the agency is considering whether industry should  
be required to do its own testing. It is also revisiting the shelf 
life of foods to see if the bacterium grows quickly at particular 
times or in particular foods after they are processed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new information based on this outbreak brings into  
question the adequacy of control procedures we've been relying 
on,'' Billy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The focus is on ready-to-eat foods such as luncheon meats  
because the bacterium can be killed if it is cooked until steaming 
hot, or past about 170 degrees. Fewer than 2,000 people in the 
United States report serious illness from listeriosis each year, 
but about one in four of them die from it. 
</P>
<P>
	Plant officials at Bil Mar voluntarily recalled about 35 million  
pounds of hot dogs and lunch meat on Dec. 22. That recall, and one 
in January of about 30 million pounds of hot dogs and luncheon meat 
from the Thorn Apple Valley plant in Arkansas, represent most of 
the increase in the pounds pulled from shelves for listeria 
contamination in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1989, when the government implemented stricter policies  
for the bacterium, illnesses from listeria monocytogenes have 
dropped 44 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	At the meeting, some federal officials also questioned whether  
they acted quickly enough in the Bil Mar recall. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the Centers for Disease Control had managed to  
trace 20 cases of food sickness to the Bil Mar plant by Dec. 18, 
and USDA officials said they met Bil Mar executives to urge them to 
consider a recall then. However, USDA officials said they did not 
feel comfortable recommending a recall until they found a package 
of unopened meat with the bacterium at the plant. That happened 
Dec. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	After several days of debate among medical experts, CDC  
officials clearly determined there was a public health threat on 
Dec. 22, the day of the recall, said Dr. Paul Mead of the CDC. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Derfler, a USDA deputy director, suggested there should be  
legislation allowing the agency to require a recall ``based on the 
threat to public health rather than what it can show about the 
content of the food.''

<HEADLINE> Canadian Skier Cracks Top 20 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- Allison Forsyth has been experiencing a bunch  
of firsts this year. Someday those experiences might make her first 
in a World Championships race. 
</P>
<P>
	Forsyth, a 20-year-old Canadian, is in her first season of World  
Cup racing, so everything is new. She scored her first World Cup 
points in the first race she finished, claiming 24th in a giant 
slalom at Park City, Utah, in November. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, in her first GS in a World Championships, she  
finished 16th, the top placing for a North American. Because she 
finished 15th in the opening run, she started first in the 
afternoon session. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was pretty stressful being first,'' Forsyth said. ``It's a  
lot better being in the middle of the pack. After about 15 racers, 
there's a track about three feet wide. But if you're the first to 
go after only three forerunners, there's a very narrow track, and I 
got off it a couple times and found some soft snow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forsyth said another problem of the second run was focus.  
</P>
<P>
	``On the first run, my focus was to attack and take all the  
risks,'' she said. ``On the second run, you have nerves and 
anxiety. You start thinking that if you go out, you'll lose what 
you've already accomplished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forsyth came from 37th, the third seed, to claim a spot in the  
top 20. The leading American, Kirsten Clark of Raymond, Maine, 
started way back in 51st and finished 22nd, although she was 19th 
after the first run. 
</P>
<P>
	``The second course was turnier so I couldn't get away with as  
much as I did the first run,'' Clark said. ``I made a couple 
mistakes but I'm happy. I was attacking. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been almost two years since I've had a good GS. It feels  
awesome,'' said Clark, who specializes in the speed events of 
downhill and super-G. ``I was given a great opportunity here to 
race in the GS. I haven't had any real solid GS this year. I've 
been training real well and they had an extra spot and they put me 
in and I'm glad they did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forsyth said she, like Clark, got a lot of positives out of the  
race, even though two Austrians and a Norwegian got the medals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't come in with any set goals, just because it was my  
first World Championships,'' Forsyth said. ``I'm really happy with 
what I accomplished today because this is the closest I've been to 
the winner and the best girls are still in there. I think 16th is 
quite an accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have liked to have gotten 15th,'' she added. ``I only  
missed by 2 hundredths. But I take confidence in what I did today. 
I know I belong at this level and I'm definitely ready to go for 
it. I know after my first run today what it takes, and ready to do 
that again.''

<HEADLINE> IOC: Sponsors Are Still Supportive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The Olympics' corporate sponsors remain supportive  
despite the corruption scandal that has scarred the games' image, 
the IOC's sponsorship chief said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Pound, the IOC vice president who negotiates key television  
and marketing deals, said international sponsors endorse the IOC's 
efforts to clean house following the Salt Lake City bribery case. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sponsors have been very supportive of the efforts we've  
been making to date to clean up this problem,'' Pound said in a 
conference call from New York. ``There is nobody that has 
withdrawn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound, who was meeting with sponsors in New York, said there was  
no indication that corporations were considering pulling out. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sponsor group has been very good, proper and  
businesslike,'' he said. ``They say, `We understand you have 
problems, we appreciate what you are doing to clean up and we are 
supportive of your efforts to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the only outspoken critic among the sponsors has been  
David D'Alessandro, president of John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro announced this week that his company was canceling  
negotiations with NBC for $20 million in ads to protest the IOC's 
handling of the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	John Hancock is part of the IOC's TOP program, a group of 11  
international sponsors who pay around $50 million each for 
exclusive rights to use the five-ring Olympic logo in ads. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro said John Hancock will also remove the Olympic  
rings from its annual report, company stationery and certain 
venues. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound downplayed Hancock's protest.  
</P>
<P>
	``John Hancock has postponed its television discussions, which  
is an add-on to its sponsorship,'' he said. ``I have spoken with 
Mr. D'Alessandro. There is no question of abandoning or thinking of 
abandoning the Olympic sponsorship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate interview with The Associated Press in New York,  
Pound said critics should wait for the outcome of a special IOC 
meeting in March, called to deal just with the corruption issue, 
before voicing concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our response, and I've discussed it with Dave, is, `Look. We  
have the message. We had the message a while ago,''' Pound said. 
```We are dealing with this. And, please, let us get on with the 
solution to this and you can judge the solution when we get to 
mid-March. And if you don't think we've done it right when all the 
smoke is cleared, then, please, make your point then.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said in the conference call that TV ad sales in North  
America and Australia are ``way ahead of schedule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He described D'Alessandro as ``the most positive'' of Olympic  
sponsors in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	``John Hancock has made fabulous use of that sponsorship for the  
betterment of the business,'' Pound said. ``I think he would like 
very much to continue it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said D'Alessandro believes he is helping the IOC by  
keeping up pressure on the committee to deal with the crisis. Pound 
said that's not necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are saying that even without that pressure we would be  
doing the same thing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound also countered D'Alessandro's suggestion that IOC  
president Juan Antonio Samaranch has failed to handle the crisis 
and may be near the end of his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a problem (Samaranch) acknowledges has arisen on his  
watch and has become a serious problem,'' Pound said. ``He wants to 
make sure action is taken to clean up and whatever changes are 
necessary to take us into the future are done under his leadership. 
I think that's important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For now, Pound said, Olympic sponsorship ``is still a fabulous  
investment.''

<HEADLINE> Lack of Money Might Still Doom Mir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's Mir space station might be discarded as  
early as August because investors who were supposedly planning to 
fund it have backed out, the nation's space chief said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The RKK Energia company, which built and runs the 13-year old  
station, said in December that it had found a private sponsor to 
keep Mir in orbit for another three years. The station was 
scheduled to be scrapped in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just wishful thinking,'' Space Agency director Yuri  
Koptev said of Energia's statement. ``They have indeed carried out 
serious work with an investor who had the money. But the investor 
has some problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shutting down Mir is favored by NASA, which wants Moscow to  
forget about Mir and dedicate its meager resources to the 
international space station. The 16-nation project is a year behind 
schedule because Russia didn't build an early component on time. 
The station's first elements were launched late last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov decreed that Energia  
could keep the Mir in operation for another three years, but only 
if private investors paid the station's yearly expenses of up to 
$250 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Primakov's decision was praised by Russia's space officials, who  
had insisted that the much-loved Mir stay in orbit, even though the 
government didn't have enough money to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the loss of the mysterious private investor, the  
station once again looks as if it will be abandoned this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``If no investor is found, we will be forced to make the tough  
decision to discard Mir in August or September,'' Koptev said at a 
news conference following a Cabinet session in which this year's 
space program was discussed. 
</P>
<P>
	He said space officials would start planning to abandon Mir if  
no money is found by April. 
</P>
<P>
	Koptev refused to name prospective investors, but denied Russian  
media reports that they could be Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
	``China has been energetically developing its own space program  
and promised to put its first astronaut in orbit by Oct. 1 this 
year,'' he said. ``If they had been interested in flying on our 
station, they would have done it a long time ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two Chinese pilots have undergone preparation at Russia's  
cosmonaut training center, but cooperation stopped there. ``We 
haven't heard from them since then,'' Koptev said. 
</P>
<P>
	Koptev also said the launch of a service module expected to  
house the international space station's first crew could also be 
delayed. Its blast-off date has been pushed back repeatedly and is 
currently set for July. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may be July, or August, or September if we encounter some  
problems,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Coupled Accused of Medicaid Scam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A couple that ran an autistic group home  
bilked Medicaid out of more than $750,000 and spent the money on 
items ranging from Star Trek memorabilia to mail-order degrees, 
state officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	``They used fake bank documents to start the not-for-profit,  
then they created a sham board of directors to run it,'' Gary 
Masline, a spokesman for the state Commission on Quality Care, said 
of Joseph and Mary Ann Fricano. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fricanos, both 52, created the Special Needs Program Inc. in  
Chatham, about 20 miles southeast of Albany, in 1994. They then 
misled the agency with fabricated personnel manuals and inaccurate 
data on time spent on resident care activities, according to a 
commission report released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple was accused in the report of using agency funds to  
purchase a mail-order Ph.D degree and a Doctor of Divinity degree; 
taking $6,000 in mileage reimbursements, despite having 
agency-funded vehicles; and using agency funds to purchase more 
than $7,000 in sports memorabilia and Star Trek collectibles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Special Needs Program had been receiving about $1 million  
each year from Medicaid and more than $200,000 annually from 
counties, school districts and other agencies to transport patients 
with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission, an independent state agency monitoring mental  
health facilities, referred the report to federal prosecutors with 
the U.S. attorney's office.

<HEADLINE> Medical Records Posted on Web </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) -- Several thousand patient records at the  
University of Michigan Medical Center inadvertently lingered on 
public Internet sites for two months. 
</P>
<P>
	``Luckily, we were notified and able to stop it this time before  
real damage was done,'' spokesman Dave Wilkins said. ``Still, on 
all fronts, we're taking it very seriously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The problem was discovered Monday when a university student  
searching for information about a doctor on the medical center's 
Web site was linked to files containing private patient records. 
</P>
<P>
	The records contained names, addresses, phone numbers, Social  
Security numbers, employment status, treatments for specific 
medical conditions and other data. The information was used to 
schedule appointments, Wilkins said. 
</P>
<P>
	No one accessed the records until Monday, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm certainly not happy about it,'' said Cary Johnson, a nurse  
at the medical center whose 2-year-old son's record was exposed. 
``I guess technology is helping us to do some things and hurting us 
in other ways.''

<HEADLINE> Vikings Must Deal With Free Agents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Minnesota Vikings conquered free agency last season by  
signing all their high-priced, high-quality players. 
</P>
<P>
	Now they'll have to do it again.  
</P>
<P>
	As the free agent signing and trading period begins Friday, the  
Vikings, who finished 15-1 before being upset by Atlanta in the NFC 
championship game, have seven starters who are unrestricted free 
agents and not a lot of money with which to work. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because most of it went last season to defensive tackle  
John Randle, offensive tackle Todd Steussie, running back Robert 
Smith and wide receiver Jake Reed, to whom the team committed $93 
million. They've since re-signed quarterback Randall Cunningham and 
offensive tackle Korey Stringer, who could have become free agents 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the way you like to do it, particularly when you can  
keep people of that quality,'' Buffalo general manager John Butler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know what your own players can do -- on and off the field.  
You're never sure when you bring in new people. But that doesn't 
mean you won't look to plug holes or be forced to let people go 
because of the cap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, teams are looking to rid themselves of players whose  
salaries exceed their value. This year's salary cap is just short 
of $57.3 million, $5 million more than last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Jeff George, his $5 million salary and his  
questionable attitude, might be out of Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	The Carolina Panthers dropped two of their originals -- defensive  
lineman Mike Fox and oft-injured linebacker Lamar Lathon; San 
Francisco is likely to dispose of cornerback Marquez Pope and 
running back Terry Kirby and is restructuring other salaries, 
Buffalo saved $4 million by ridding itself of veterans Quinn Early 
and Wayne Simmons and New Orleans has made it known it won't 
re-sign troubled quarterback Kerry Collins, picked up from Carolina 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
	There's also an X-factor, the new Cleveland Browns, who went  
cheap in the expansion draft, leaving them close to $40 million to 
spend on free agents, meaning they can outbid almost anyone. For 
example, they are reportedly ready to bid $5 million a year for 
defensive end Chad Bratzke of the New York Giants, a number the 
Giants probably won't try to match. 
</P>
<P>
	The deepest position in free agency is wide receiver, headed by  
All-Pro Antonio Freeman of Green Bay, who is likely to be given a 
franchise player tag to protect him. Cincinnati did the same this 
week with Carl Pickens, whom they may trade for the two first-round 
draft picks that come with that tag. Arizona might do the same with 
Rob Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	Others available include J.J. Stokes of San Francisco, Sean  
Dawkins of New Orleans, Charles Johnson of Pittsburgh and Leslie 
Shepherd of Washington. The 49ers' Terrell Owens, a restricted free 
agent, might be the most attractive and could go because San 
Francisco is nearly $30 million over the cap and probably can't 
match a pre-emptive offer from a team with money, like the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	The success of the Vikings contrasts with the way other teams  
have thrown money around with little result. For example, Seattle 
spent millions on big-name free agents for the second straight 
year, but finished 8-8, costing coach Dennis Erickson his job. One 
problem: the revolving door game in which the Seahawks lost center 
Kevin Mawae, who went to the New York Jets and became the hub of 
their vastly improved offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
	That's what makes free agency risky.  
</P>
<P>
	Many players are improved by the players around them, like wide  
Alvin Harper, a standout in Dallas playing opposite Michael Irvin. 
He did nothing after signing in 1995 with Tampa Bay. Bratzke, a 
good but not great player whose 11 1/2 sacks came in part because 
All-Pro Michael Strahan played the other end, could be a player 
whose performance diminishes elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	What the Vikings do might turn on what happens with Brad  
Johnson, who began last season as the starting quarterback, got 
hurt twice and never got his job back from Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, due a $1.15 million bonus March 1, may be traded to  
Baltimore, coached by former Minnesota offensive coordinator Brian 
Billick. He's by far the most attractive quarterback available in a 
market that includes Collins, and veteran backups like Rich Gannon 
of Kansas City and Steve Bono of St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	That would provide cap room to sign those Vikings who can leave  
-- three quarters of the team's secondary, Pro Bowl linebacker Ed 
McDaniel, defensive linemen Derrick Alexander, Jerry Ball and Jason 
Fisk, fullback Chuck Evans and third-down back and kick returner 
David Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Management will do an excellent job,'' Cunningham said. ``They  
did an excellent job getting guys signed last year, and they'll do 
it again this year, I'm sure.''

<HEADLINE> Seagram Loses $226M in Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Seagram Co. lost $226 million in its fiscal  
second quarter, reversing a profit from a year earlier, on costs to 
slash jobs and merge record labels after its Universal Music Group 
absorbed PolyGram NV. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding those restructuring costs, Seagram still recorded  
lower profits as its Universal Studios suffered a dismal quarter at 
the box office that forced a major management shakeup. 
</P>
<P>
	Seagram reported Wednesday that its loss for the quarter ended  
Dec. 31 equaled 62 cents per share. The loss compared to a profit 
of $28 million, or 8 cents per share, in the same period a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose 11 percent to $3.33 billion from $3.01 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	The recent quarter's results include $405 million in  
restructuring costs related to its $10.4 billion PolyGram takeover, 
which was completed Dec. 10. and made Universal Music the world's 
largest record company. 
</P>
<P>
	Universal Music has cut 1,200 jobs, trimmed some artists from  
its roster and merged several labels, trying to squeeze $300 
million in annual cost savings out of the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding any affects from the PolyGram deal, Seagram's profits  
from continuing operations dropped 69 percent to $18 million, or 5 
cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the drop, the results were better than analysts'  
expectations for 2 cents per share. Seagram stock rose 62 1/2 cents to 
close at $49.31 1/4 per share on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Universal Studios suffered expensive flops with the Brad Pitt  
film ``Meet Joe Black'' and ``Babe: Pig in the City'' during the 
quarter. The studio's lackluster performance led to the dismissal 
of Universal Studios chairman Frank Biondi and Universal Pictures 
chairman Casey Silver in November. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to shaking up its top ranks, Universal plans to seek  
co-financing deals with other studios to reduce its risk on 
expensive films. 
</P>
<P>
	The weakness in film operations offset higher results from  
Seagram's music, theme park and wine and spirits businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of its fiscal year, Seagram earned $938  
million, or $2.64 per share, which included a $1.07 billion gain on 
the sale of its Tropicana juice business to PepsiCo Inc. Seagram 
earned $161 million, or 45 cents per share, in the same period a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose to $5.57 billion from $5.38 billion.

<HEADLINE> Swimmer Hopes To Overturn Drug Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A test showing containers used to transport urine  
samples can be opened without detection has given three-time 
Olympic gold medalist Michelle Smith-De Bruin hope of overturning a 
four-year drug ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Swimming's governing body, FINA, imposed the ban on Smith-De  
Bruin six months ago when it found her guilty of tampering with an 
out-of-competition urine test taken a year ago at her home in 
Kilkenny, Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	FINA said the sample was contaminated with large amounts of  
alcohol, probably whiskey. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith-De Bruin has appealed the decision to the International  
Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, Switzerland, which is 
to hear case May 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``We put it to the FINA doping panel and they pooh-poohed it,  
saying it was a theoretical possibility,'' Smith-De Bruin's lawyer, 
Peter Lennon, said in Thursday's Irish Times. ``I don't think now 
it will be dismissed at the CAS as it was at FINA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chemist David Brown, in test results released this week and  
carried out on behalf of British shot putter Paul Edwards, showed 
the Versapak drug-test containers could be opened and closed 
without detection by immersing them in boiling water. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards, who had been banned for life, had his suspension lifted  
Tuesday by UK Athletics pending a review of his case. 
</P>
<P>
	Lennon said he didn't think he would have to show why someone  
would want to tamper with Smith-DeBruin's sample in order to have 
the ban overturned. 
</P>
<P>
	Gunnar Werner, honorary secretary of FINA, argued just the  
opposite, saying Smith-DeBruin would need to show a motive. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mere allegation of a possible technique should hardly be  
enough,'' he said. ``Who could have had an interest in sabotaging 
the Michelle Smith-DeBruin samples?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking Wednesday on Irish RTE radio, Smith-DeBruin said the  
test would add weight to her case. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be getting a video of this and we'll bring Dr. Brown  
with us to the appeals hearing,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is only one string in our bow in terms of the evidence  
Peter will be bringing to Lausanne, but it certainly gives a lot of 
credence to what we knew all along -- that this type of Versapak can 
be tampered with. It can be done in three minutes and it is 
impossible to detect.''

<HEADLINE> Babe Ruth's Autograph Stolen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A half century after his death, getting a copy of  
Babe Ruth's signature can cost tens of thousands of dollars. Even 
then, it's hard to be completely sure, in this day of fakes and 
forgeries, that you have the genuine article. 
</P>
<P>
	But someone found a way to get the Babe's real John Hancock --  
guaranteed -- absolutely free. 
</P>
<P>
	Rifling through public documents, a thief pilfered deeds to the  
180-acre farm he bought in a Boston suburb in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the most recent in a spate of courthouse thefts of wills,  
deeds and other documents signed by Hall of Famers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the first time I've ever heard of it happening,'' said  
Michael Ring, the Middlesex County First Assistant Register of 
Deeds in Cambridge. ``But value is in the eye of the beholder. It's 
like an antique -- to some people it's an antique, to others it's 
just an old piece of furniture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ring said two documents are missing altogether and the signature  
of Ruth and his first wife, Helen, were cut out of a third. He said 
whoever took the signatures snuck them away from a counter under 
the watch of clerks. 
</P>
<P>
	In nearby Boston, documents with the signatures of three Hall of  
Fame players -- George Wright, Hugh Duffy and Tommy McCarthy -- had 
been reported missing from the Suffolk County Courthouse. All 
played in the late 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors this week charged a county probation officer,  
55-year-old Joseph Schnabel of Pembroke, with larceny in the 
disappearance of the will of Wright's wife, Abbie, which bore her 
husband's signature. He's also charged with taking a document with 
the signature of Hall of Fame umpire Thomas Connolly. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston police and the FBI are continuing to investigate,  
according to Suffolk County prosecutor Gerald Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	The Babe Ruth documents date back to when he bought ``Home Run  
Farm,'' a sprawling property on Dutton Road in Sudbury where he 
lived and raised farm animals. 
</P>
<P>
	They include a record of a $6,000 mortgage payment in June 1923  
and a deed to convey the property to his wife in October 1925. The 
signatures were clipped out of a third document, a deed that 
conveyed the property from Helen Ruth to a Weston man in April 
1926. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruth was playing for the New York Yankees when he bought the  
house. He was a member of the last Red Sox team to win the World 
Series in 1918, and was sold to the Yankees following the 1919 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Clark, curator of collections at the Baseball Hall of Fame  
in Cooperstown, N.Y., said he has heard reports over the years of 
people stealing public records for signatures of famous players. 
</P>
<P>
	While the signatures may be genuine, the thieves would probably  
have a hard time marketing them once they are reported stolen, he 
said, especially records signed by Babe Ruth, who was liberal with 
his autograph. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ruth signed so many things that if there is any hint about  
something not being above board, most collectors would probably shy 
away from it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, there is small difference between his signature on the  
documents and the one he scrawled on baseballs: Ruth used his full 
name -- ``George Herman Ruth'' -- on the deeds. For fans he simply 
wrote ``Babe Ruth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clark said signatures of the other three Hall of Famers might be  
more tempting to collectors because those players, all pioneers of 
the game, signed fewer autographs. 
</P>
<P>
	Suffolk officials noticed the signatures were missing when a  
document signed in 1913 by Wright was listed in the catalog of a 
New York auction house. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of the thefts, officials in both counties have taken  
further steps to protect their records. Visitors are already 
required to present a photo ID and fill out a card listing the 
record they want to view.

<HEADLINE> GM Introduces 2000 Monte Carlo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- While its competition has cut back on coupes,  
Chevrolet is sticking with the declining market. The volume 
division of General Motors Corp. today introduced its 2000 Monte 
Carlo that goes on sale next fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's still coupe buyers out there who want an exciting  
brand,'' Chevrolet general manager Kurt Ritter said after the car 
was unveiled at the Chicago Auto Show's media preview. 
</P>
<P>
	The midsize Monte Carlo is the coupe version of the new Impala,  
which also shares its chassis and major mechanical parts with the 
Pontiac Grand Prix, Oldsmobile Intrigue and Buick Century and 
Regal. 
</P>
<P>
	The new version borrows a few styling cues from the original  
Monte Carlos of the 1970s, including a long hood, blunt rear end, 
vertical taillights and the return of the ``knight'' emblem. But 
the overall look is a departure from the current Lumina-based Monte 
Carlo. 
</P>
<P>
	Coupe sales have been down sharply this decade as buyers have  
flocked to sport utility vehicles and sedans. In the last few 
years, Ford Motor Co. eliminated the Thunderbird and Probe coupes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ritter said Chevy expects to sell 70,000 to 80,000 Monte Carlos  
a year, up from around 65,000 last year. That compares with plans 
to sell about 200,000 Impalas. The cars will be built at GM's 
Oshawa, Ontario, plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevrolet will target the Monte Carlo to drivers in their  
mid-30s to mid-40s. 
</P>
<P>
	Other new models introduced Wednesday at the Chicago show  
include the 2000 Pontiac Bonneville sedan, Nissan's 2000 Maxima 
sedan, Toyota's Camry Solara convertible and a new Toyota sports 
car. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota's MR-Spyder is a mid-engine, soft-top roadster that will  
give the Mazda Miata some competition in the $20,000 to $25,000 
price range. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement follows last month's strong indication by  
Nissan that it will revive an affordable Z-car in the next two 
years, and Honda's plan to introduce its S2000 roadster to the U.S. 
market next fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The MR-Spyder will replace the MR2, a hardtop sports car that  
remains on sale in Japan but was pulled from the North American 
market in 1995 because of slow sales. 
</P>
<P>
	It borrows some styling from its higher-priced competition: the  
circular fender flares look like they came off the new Audi TT, 
while the rear-end design looks a lot like the Porsche Boxster's, 
complete with big air scoops to cool the engine that rests behind 
the seats. 
</P>
<P>
	The car will be built in Japan, but executives would not say  
when it might go on sale there or Europe. Toyota said the 
production version will be very similar to the concept car. 
</P>
<P>
	The MR-Spyder will be powered by a new 1.8-liter, twin-cam,  
four-cylinder engine rated at 140 horsepower. It also features an 
unusual five-speed manual transmission that does not use a clutch. 
The driver can shift using a conventional center console shifter, 
or by pressing buttons on either side of the steering wheel. 
</P>
<P>
	The convertible Solara will be produced in Cambridge, Ontario,  
and go on sale in spring 2000. The convertible modification to the 
coupe will be done by ASC, which is opening a new plant near the 
Toyota factory. 
</P>
<P>
	It is aimed at buyers who desire both a sports car and the room  
and comfort of a larger car. It will be offered with a choice of 
four-cylinder or V6 engines, a standard four-speed automatic 
transmission, a power folding top and a glass rear window. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota expects to sell only 6,000 convertibles a year. The coupe  
went on sale last fall; Toyota plans to sell 50,000 this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan said its larger, more luxurious 2000 Maxima sedan will go  
on sale in June. The car comes with a more powerful 3-liter V6. The 
styling is less bland than that of the current generation Maxima, 
featuring more distinctive front- and rear-end treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Seergy, a Nissan vice president, said the car will be  
priced in the same low- to mid-$20,000 price range as the current 
model. He said Nissan expects to sell 110,000 Maximas a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pontiac division of General Motors Corp. unveiled its  
redesigned flagship sedan, the Bonneville, which executives 
described as a sporty luxury car ``with attitude.'' It shares its 
chassis and major mechanical parts with the Buick LeSabre. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Bonneville has Pontiac's styling trademarks, including  
``cat's eye'' headlights and lots of lower body cladding with 
sculpted ``gills'' to give it a more aggressive look. The car will 
come with a standard V6 engine that can be upgraded with a 
supercharger that boosts power to 240 horsepower from 205. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bonneville is aimed at baby boomer families who ``want a car  
that helps them look and feel young,'' said Mary Boland, Pontiac 
brand manager. The car will be produced at GM's Orion Township 
plant outside Detroit.

<HEADLINE> Study Links Scars to Breast Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A microscopic change in breast tissue can help doctors predict  
whether a woman whose biopsy is benign may develop cancer, 
researchers reported today in the New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	If the tissue has an abnormality called a radial scar, the woman  
is almost twice as likely to develop cancer, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a microscope, normal breast tissue shows random clusters  
of ducts. Radial scars have a core of what appears to be scarred 
tissue surrounded by a cluster of ducts radiating outward. 
</P>
<P>
	Some studies found a link between radial scars and breast  
cancer, while others were inconclusive. The latest study, conducted 
at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Brigham and Women's 
Hospital in Boston, is believed to be the largest so far. 
</P>
<P>
	It looked at 1,396 women with benign breast biopsies.  
Ninety-nine had radial scars. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly one-third -- 32 -- of the women with radial scars later  
developed breast cancer, compared with 223, or about one-fifth, of 
those without the abnormalities. 
</P>
<P>
	The risks were higher among women with more and larger radial  
scars.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Cancer Drug Enters New Phase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Government scientists have finally been able to  
reproduce a scientist's highly publicized results for an 
anti-cancer drug and are now seeking to begin the first human 
tests, The Boston Globe reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The breakthrough using the drug endostatin came only when  
National Cancer Institute scientists conducted the experiment in 
the Children's Hospital laboratory of researcher Dr. Judah Folkman, 
who discovered it and found that it reduced tumors in mice. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, NCI scientists said they could not match Folkman's  
promising test results using a small quantity of the drug Folkman 
sent them. Folkman attributed the failure to the drug's sensitivity 
to handling, storage and the way it's administered. The institute, 
in Frederick, Md., then sent researchers to Folkman's lab in 
November and December. 
</P>
<P>
	``This substantiates the idea that these are technical issues''  
that led to the failure at the NCI laboratory, Dr. Robert Wittes, 
deputy director of the institute, told the Globe. ``Now we will 
move to facilities in Frederick and try to reproduce the results 
down here,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Folkman gained worldwide attention last spring when The New York  
Times reported in a page one story on his findings that endostatin 
and a related drug, angiostatin, shrunk tumors in rats by cutting 
off their blood supply. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Bristol-Myers Squibb pharmaceutical company said  
it would no longer work with a partnering company to develop 
angiostatin, saying the project had not produced a drug that was 
consistently effective. 
</P>
<P>
	The partner, the tiny biotech company EntreMed, said it would  
press ahead with tests on angiostatin, but investors sliced the 
company's value in half Wednesday after Bristol-Myers quit plans to 
pay for human testing. Today, shares of EntreMed regained all it 
had lost. Shares rose $12.94, or 100 percent, to $25.71 in 
mid-afternoon trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	EntreMed said it plans to seek Food and Drug Administration  
approval to begin human testing of angiostatin and endostatin later 
this year.

<HEADLINE> Senators Near Vote on Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With acquittal assured, the Senate talked its  
way through closed-door deliberations Thursday at President 
Clinton's impeachment trial, set for climactic noontime votes 
Friday in the case that one Democrat called ``this sordid saga.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine became the fourth Republican to  
declare her intention to vote to acquit on both charges, following 
the lead of other moderates who broke party ranks a day earlier. 
``In my heart and in my mind, I believe to a moral certainty that 
my verdict is just,'' she declared in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
	A two-thirds vote is required to convict the president and  
remove him from office, and there was no chance of that happening. 
Instead, whatever suspense lingered at the end of the five-week 
trial was whether either article of impeachment would attain a bare 
majority -- a psychological threshold that had no bearing on 
Clinton's fate. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have a 55-45 majority in the Senate.  
</P>
<P>
	A steady stream of lawmakers came forward Thursday to announce  
their intentions for the roll calls on perjury and obstruction of 
justice, dividing largely along party lines on presidential guilt 
or innocence but offering nonpartisan condemnations of Clinton's 
behavior with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``There can be no doubt that President Clinton's conduct has  
made a mockery of most of his words, or that his example has been 
corrosive beyond calculation to our culture and to our children,'' 
said Oregon Republican Gordon Smith, who said he would vote to 
convict. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one, not any senator in this chamber nor any person in this  
country, will look at this president in the same way again,'' said 
Democrat Dick Durbin of Illinois, who said he would vote for 
acquittal on both charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Lieberman said he had concluded that Clinton's  
``wrongdoing in this sordid saga does not justify making him the 
first president to be ousted from office in our history.'' The 
Connecticut Democrat had commanded nationwide attention last 
September with highly critical words about Clinton's behavior at a 
time the White House still hoped to avoid congressional action. 
</P>
<P>
	For all the expressions of disgust, a formal effort to censure  
the president appeared all but dead, a victim of Republican 
opposition. Democrats said they would make an effort to force a 
post-trial vote on the Senate floor, and failing passage, would 
draft a statement of condemnation. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Republicans, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, John Chafee of  
Rhode Island and James Jeffords of Vermont, announced on Wednesday 
they would not vote for conviction on either article. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Slade Gorton of Washington has announced he will vote  
against the perjury charge, but in favor of the obstruction charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Two moderate Northeastern senators -- Olympia Snowe and Susan  
Collins of Maine -- have yet to disclose their decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Another moderate, Smith from Oregon, stepped forward during the  
day to say he would vote for conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	``I refuse to say that high political polls and soaring Wall  
Street indexes give license to those in high places who act in low 
and illegal ways,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Democrats, Senate aides said the only question was whether  
Robert C., Byrd of West Virginia, a longtime party leader, would 
break ranks and join Republicans in voting to convict. 
</P>
<P>
	Controversy broke out over a report that Clinton had vowed  
revenge on House Republicans at the polls in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is deeply troubling that the president views closure of  
this constitutional process as an opportunity for revenge,'' said 
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart didn't deny presidential  
anger, but said, ``I can't think of a worse, more dumb strategy 
than going after people based on whether they were a House manager 
or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You look at the House managers and the vast majority are in  
safe seats or unopposed seats,'' he said. The 2000 election is 21 
months distant, and Clinton has promised a strenuous effort to help 
Democrats regain control of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial had only a few hours to run.  
</P>
<P>
	Chief Justice William Rehnquist made the trip from the Supreme  
Court in his limousine Friday, as he has for each session since the 
trial began on Jan. 8, and a few moments later the Senate's doors 
were closed for deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
	As the day began, Lott said 37 senators had yet to speak, each  
given 15 minutes under 19th century Senate impeachment rules. 
Senators are prohibited upon pain of expulsion from disclosing what 
was said, and few details emerged. 
</P>
<P>
	But several senators issued written statements during the day.  
</P>
<P>
	``The House managers failed to establish that the president's  
conduct amounts to 'high crimes and misdemeanors,''' said Sen. Jack 
Reed of Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Wayne Allard, R-Colo., saw the case otherwise. ``When  
President Clinton chose not to 'tell the truth, the whole truth and 
nothing but the triuth,' he put himself above the law. He violated 
his oath and undermined the rule of law which he had sworn to 
uphold.''

<HEADLINE> Brits, French Join Kosovo Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- The British and French foreign  
ministers arrived at Kosovo peace talks today to urge rival Serbs 
and ethnic Albanians to speed up negotiations or face NATO 
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	Serb delegates, meanwhile, made what they saw as a gesture of  
good will, unilaterally signing a set of principles that include 
preserving the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia, Serb sources 
said on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The principles, set out by the six-nation Contact Group that is  
trying to find a solution to the Kosovo crisis, also provide for a 
cease-fire in Kosovo and the amnesty and release of ethnic Albanian 
prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,000 people have died and hundreds of thousands have  
been left homeless in a year of fighting between ethnic Albanian 
separatists and Serbian security forces in the southern province of 
Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't possible to independently confirm the Serb signing of  
the principles, and an international mediator, speaking on 
condition of anonymity, said that in any case it wouldn't be 
considered a major development in the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	The mediators say that merely by attending the talks, both sides  
have already agreed on the basic principles laid out by the Contact 
Group, made up of the United States and other countries outside the 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and his French  
counterpart Hubert Vedrine met Serbian president Milan Milutinovic 
in the 14th-century chateau where the Kosovo negotiations have 
continued since the weekend without major progress. 
</P>
<P>
	Milutinovic was urging Cook and Vedrine to pressure the ethnic  
Albanian delegation to publicly sign a pledge giving up their 
long-held goal of independence for the province. 
</P>
<P>
	Milutinovic also arrived in Rambouillet with a message from  
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, that included the Serb 
willingness to sign the Contact Group principles, sources close to 
the talks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic Wednesday warned ethnic Albanians that if they don't  
publicly give up their dream of independence, the Kosovo peace 
conference could fail. 
</P>
<P>
	The Albanians are unlikely to agree to give up independence,  
their ultimate goal after a proposed interim period of three years. 
Albanian negotiators are calling for a referendum on independence, 
an immediate cease-fire and NATO guarantees for the eventual 
interim settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources from both sides say that so far, not a single line of a  
proposed peace text has been approved. A Western diplomat close to 
the talks said 25 percent of what international mediators had 
planned for the first four days of the talks has been achieved. 
</P>
<P>
	The rival sides came to the peace conference when NATO issued an  
ultimatum: If they didn't show up, the alliance would strike 
Yugoslavia and there would be toughened measures to cut off weapons 
and financing to the Kosovo rebels. The two sides were given a 
maximum of two weeks for reaching a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright clarified  
two NATO scenarios in case a peace deal was not reached. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Serbs are responsible for the fact that the talks have  
failed then it will be Serb targets that are hit,'' Albright told 
France 3 television. ``If the Albanians are responsible for it, 
then they will lose the support of the international community, 
something they depend on in order to pursue their goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, officials are mapping  
out plans to send up to 30,000 peacekeeping troops into Kosovo. 
Britain and France have already volunteered troops and President 
Clinton says he is considering sending up to 4,000 American 
soldiers.

<HEADLINE> IOC Probe Chief Says Values Needed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dick Pound has seen some sorry sights in the  
last two months while investigating his Olympic colleagues in the 
Salt Lake City bribery case. 
</P>
<P>
	Some were petty, some were tacky, some were much more serious  
among the actions of at least 24 IOC members now implicated in the 
games' biggest scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no fun to read all that and see it in black and white,''  
said Pound, a Canadian lawyer who heads the IOC's six-man 
corruption-inquiry panel. ``And I think to our whole commission, it 
was very disturbing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC ... requires a genuine shared set of values and  
standards of conduct. And we've kind of slipped away from that, 
obviously. Maybe a fifth of our members fell below.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound and his panel are preparing to reopen their investigation  
with information from a Salt Lake ethics commission that implicated 
10 more IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	It also provided new evidence about the highest-ranking member  
so far linked to scandal -- and Pound said that evidence definitely 
would be reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim Un-yong of South Korea, an IOC executive board member and  
powerful sports agency leader, knew about a $75,000 job for his 
son, John Kim, that was paid in full by Salt Lake bidders, 
according to the ethics report released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the case of Dr. Kim, we certainly did not know of the  
somewhat complicated employment relationships, other than what we 
read in the media,'' Pound said. ``So that's something that we will 
look at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, who was already under investigation on lesser evidence, has  
denied knowledge of the job and said repeatedly this week that the 
ethics report exonerated him of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said Kim would be asked by his panel to explain the Salt  
Lake findings before any further action is taken. He said a chance 
to respond would be extended to any member the IOC panel feels 
should be investigated further, something that he criticized Salt 
Lake for apparently failing to do. 
</P>
<P>
	He was particularly upset by the case of Phil Coles of  
Australia. The report said Coles made four trips to Salt Lake and 
took in the Super Bowl at bid committee expense. Coles said he made 
one bid-sponsored trip to Utah, went to the football game as a 
guest of others and never was approached by investigators to tell 
his side. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly Phil Coles has responded with a full broadside,''  
Pound said. He added that investigators ``perhaps could have at 
least found time to send him a fax and say, `This is what we have 
found and are duly bound to report. Do you have an explanation?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said the report contained no bombshells, but provided  
useful leads. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a number of names there that are going to come up,''  
he said. ``I think we are duty-bound to follow up and see if 
there's an explanation. ... It's out there now and we can't say we 
didn't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Pound criticized the report's lack of detail in some  
cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of loose ends dangling out there with no  
conclusions,'' he said. ``You can take leaps of faith and conclude 
there may have been inappropriate conduct, but it sounds like they 
may not have followed through and asked for explanations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the scandal, Pound said the IOC remained an organization  
that he would like to lead, a goal he has held for the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have my days,'' he said. ``But at its best, very much so. It  
has been over the years and can be in years to come a real force 
for positive things that happen all around the world -- with sports, 
with youth, with people involved in their community, with 
volunteers and so forth. I think it's a genuine force for good.''

<HEADLINE> Questions Remain Over Tyson Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Mike Tyson has always been a rough fighter, but not an  
especially dirty one until the night of June 28, 1997, when he 
committed an act that opened the final chapter of his boxing 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	How long the chapter runs, or if it already has been concluded,  
remains to be seen, but there is no doubt that when he bit a chunk 
out of Evander Holyfield's right ear, the image of ``the baddest 
man on the planet'' changed for good. 
</P>
<P>
	Baddest men don't bite. They don't assault 50 and 63-year-old  
men either. That's what Tyson has been sentenced to a year in jail 
for doing after a traffic accident at Gaithersburg, Md., last Aug. 
31. 
</P>
<P>
	There are people who argue that the sentence was too severe, but  
there is no arguing that it was just another incident of Tyson 
reacting adversely to a situation. Such reactions can get you 
disqualified in boxing. They can get you jailed outside the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm Mike, and Mike is going to be Mike,'' Tyson told a bunch  
of boxing writers a few days before his fifth-round knockout of 
Francois Botha Jan. 16, his only fight since the Bite Fight. 
</P>
<P>
	There seems to be a Mike who feels the world is against him, Yet  
he also seems to feel it's a weakness not to act defiant. He can't 
seem to, or doesn't want to, shuck the baddest man image he built 
and which those involved in the selling of the Mike Tyson have 
cultivated. 
</P>
<P>
	The sentence in Maryland was imposed last Friday on Tyson, who  
pleaded no-contest to two misdemeanor assault charges, and his 
attorneys have 30 days to decide whether to appeal. An appeal could 
lead to a jury trial and an even longer jail term. There also is 
the matter of what an Indiana judge will do in the matter of 
Tyson's parole on a rape conviction for which he served three 
years. His parole is due to end in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maryland incident happened while Tyson was still seeking to  
get back his boxing license, revoked by the Nevada State Athletic 
Commission for biting both of Holyfield's ears. The first bite was 
the one that ripped a piece out of Holyfield's right ear. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, who reportedly has a four-fight, $33 million television  
deal with Showtime, which also has paid his $14 million tax bill, 
was scheduled to fight April 24 in the second of a four-bout deal 
with the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	That fight remains possible, but it's iffy.  
</P>
<P>
	One question that has been answered is that Tyson, who will be  
33 on June 30, is a long way from being the fighter who was the 
most feared in the world from 1986 to 1990. His speed and movement 
have been slowed by inactivity (seven fights in about 7 years, 7 
months). 
</P>
<P>
	Even before his shocking upset by James ``Buster'' Douglas in  
1990, out-of-the-ring distractions were hurting Tyson as a fighter. 
The knockout loss to Holyfield in 1996 stripped from him the cloak 
of invincibility that Douglas had badly torn. Intimidation can 
still be Tyson's weapon in some cases, but it's been badly watered 
down, as shown by Botha, who was taunting Iron Mike before he got 
careless and got nailed. 
</P>
<P>
	Another question is if Tyson fights again, can he be, and for  
how, long a a major attraction? Are people getting tired of his 
soapbox life in a society filled with real-life soapbox dramas.

<HEADLINE> GOP Pushes Milder Tax Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans are working on modest tax relief  
alternatives as more questions are raised about the political 
wisdom of pushing a huge 10 percent income tax reduction that may 
never become law. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to ask yourself: Do you want to attempt something  
that may not be attainable, thereby deflating your supporters?'' 
asked Rep. Steve Largent, R-0kla. 
</P>
<P>
	Foremost among the options gaining in popularity is elimination  
of the marriage penalty, a quirk in the tax code in which millions 
of two-income couples pay more tax than if they weren't married. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans are determined to use for tax relief some of the  
projected $2.56 trillion budget surplus over the next decade, 
although most agree with President Clinton that 62 percent of the 
surplus should go to keep Social Security solvent. The fight will 
come over what to do with the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10 percent income tax cut enjoyed a boomlet of support when  
the new Congress convened last month. Now Republicans see several 
drawbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The broad cut is expensive, at an estimated $743 billion over 10  
years, and President Clinton is likely to threaten a veto as 
Democrats pound home their claim that it primarily benefits the 
wealthy. Such a fight could have a major impact on 2000 races, with 
control of the House hanging in the balance. 
</P>
<P>
	Fixing the marriage penalty, in contrast, enjoys broad support  
within the GOP and among Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't sense overwhelming support for a 10 percent reduction  
in rates,'' said Rep. Jerry Weller, R-Ill., a main sponsor of the 
marriage penalty measure. ``The best way is a more targeted 
approach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The marriage penalty affects an estimated 21 million two-income  
couples, many firmly in the middle class, who pay an average of 
$1,400 more in income taxes than they would if single. 
</P>
<P>
	Bills drafted by Weller and Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn. -- both  
members of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee -- would 
fix this problem by giving married couples who file jointly a 
standard deduction equal to twice the $4,250 now available for 
singles. 
</P>
<P>
	Weller's measure, which had 223 cosponsors as of Wednesday,  
would go a big step further by extending the 15 percent tax bracket 
for married couples from a maximum of $41,200 now to $49,300, so 
that more of their income would be taxed at a lower rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Had those changes been made for 1998, it would have meant an  
average of $1,400 more for married couples. The Johnson measure 
would cost roughly $28 billion over five years, Weller's more than 
$100 billion in the same period. 
</P>
<P>
	For Republicans, the legislation has the added attraction of  
broad support from social conservative groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrea Sheldon, executive director of the Traditional Values  
Coalition, which represents 40,000 churches, said marriage penalty 
relief not only cuts taxes but makes a strong pro-family statement 
instead of discouraging couples from tying the knot. 
</P>
<P>
	To be sure, Republicans are far from giving up on the 10 percent  
income-tax reduction. The chairmen of the two budget committees, 
Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico and Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, are 
likely to include versions in spending blueprints Congress will 
consider this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	But those blueprints aren't binding, and the real heavy lifting  
on tax cuts will occur later in the Ways and Means Committee and in 
the Senate Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation circulated by Johnson and supported by 11 other  
House GOP moderates that includes marriage penalty relief would 
also raise the outside earnings limit for Social Security 
recipients, accelerate full tax deductibility of health insurance 
premiums for self-employed people and enact tax breaks for 
long-term care and affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure is similar to the five-year, $80 billion tax relief  
package passed last fall by the House but never taken up by the 
Senate. This year's version would cost about $100 billion over five 
years.

	BROKEN ARROW, Okla. (AP) -- Thou shalt not come across as preachy  
or judgmental when ministering to the souls of sheriff's deputies 
or police officers. 
</P>
<P>
	That's one lesson students learn about bringing spirituality  
into crime fighting during one of the nation's only training 
academies for law enforcement chaplains. 
</P>
<P>
	The 36-hour course offered through the Tulsa County Sheriff's  
Office combines theology with weapons training to help prepare 
chaplains for their roles in counseling officers, assisting crime 
victims, tending to the suicidal and breaking the news of death to 
survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The purpose of the basic academy,'' coordinator Mike Hardgrove  
said, ``is to take someone with little or no experience with law 
enforcement and bring them up to speed and get them out in the 
field without them being a total liability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nondenominational course meets twice weekly for five weeks  
at the Tulsa Technology Center campus in suburban Broken Arrow. Any 
chaplain or would-be chaplain from a Tulsa-area law agency may 
attend, at no cost to them. The first class of 25 men and women 
graduates this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Nanci Dotson, a soft-spoken woman wearing a tiny cross on a  
chain around her neck, prayed for guidance before signing up. She 
is a reserve sheriff's deputy in Tulsa, a Methodist and a 
grandmother who hopes to soothe the stress of police work with 
compassion. 
</P>
<P>
	``In almost 60 years, I've had a lot of experiences, good and  
bad, and that has given me a heart to maybe help,'' Ms. Dotson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chaplains are unarmed and unpaid volunteers in most cases.  
</P>
<P>
	Training them makes sense and yet it is rare, said David W.  
DeRevere, executive director of the International Conference of 
Police Chaplains in Destin, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a few states have accredited programs, he said, adding that  
most of the nation's new chaplains have to learn as they go. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tulsa course was the first chaplain's academy in Oklahoma to  
win approval from the Council on Law Enforcement Education and 
Training in Oklahoma City. That will improve the graduates' 
credibility in the eyes of police, said the council's Gary James. 
``It makes the officers a little more conscious, a little more 
aware it's important,'' James said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's intense sometimes,'' said Bert Snethen, coordinating  
chaplain for the Owasso Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Snethen, a member of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of  
Latter Day Saints, said attending the course has reinforced the 
importance of trust and confidentiality when ministering to police. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes they figure you're a goody-two-shoes,'' Snethen  
said. ``They don't open up like you'd like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Units in the chaplain's academy cover subjects such as legal  
liability, ethics, death notification, weapons familiarization, 
testifying in court, self-defense, stress management, suicide 
intervention and grief counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	Students take a multiple-choice exam after each unit. Some have  
dropped out since the course began Jan. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Al Morgan taught a unit on ``ride alongs.'' Morgan, a  
communications professor at Oral Roberts University, coordinates 
the academy with Hardgrove. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan told the class that riding along with a patrol officer  
was the best way to get to know the person and gain his or her 
confidence. Do the Lord's work by listening to the officer's subtle 
requests for guidance, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're not listening, you might miss it,'' Morgan said.  
</P>
<P>
	Effective chaplains are aware of the tender hearts behind the  
badges, Morgan said, as cries of ``amen!'' answered from the class. 
</P>
<P>
	Printed handouts to the class said chaplains should find their  
inspiration in the Bible, and that through prayer they can help 
officers make sense of adultery, lies, euthanasia, homosexuality 
and suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Episcopalian priest Clark Shackelford is a member of the first  
academy class. The pastor of St. Matthew's Church in Sand Springs 
signed up after a local police detective asked him to become the 
department's chaplain. 
</P>
<P>
	The risks of encountering a line-of-fire police crisis do not  
frighten Shackelford. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what ministry is all about,'' he said, ``taking chances  
for other people.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- All the testing in the world can't  
substitute for what NASCAR drivers enjoyed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	It's called real racing.  
</P>
<P>
	While the twin 125-mile qualifying races were run to fill out  
most of the field for Sunday's Daytona 500, drivers like Jeff 
Gordon -- who had already clinched the pole position -- used it as 
their first live-action tests of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you run a race like this, where you don't pit or get  
tires or fuel or anything, that's the best test we can possibly 
have,'' said Gordon, who finished second in the day's first race. 
``So, we all know where our cars are handling-wise, where we are 
speed wise. Now you just fine tune.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon started on the pole and held the lead through the first  
30-plus laps. He fell back in the latter part of the race and 
couldn't find any drafting help to pull back on top. 
</P>
<P>
	But because he had the best time in qualifying rounds run last  
week, he is ensured of the pole. 
</P>
<P>
	And the most important thing the two-time defending series  
champion learned from the qualifying race is that he likes the car 
he brings to the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we're gonna do much to it,'' Gordon said. ``I  
like the car. I feel we've got a car capable of winning Daytona 
500.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	20-SECOND WARNING: It took less than a single lap -- or about 20  
seconds of racing -- for the official 1999 NASCAR season to endure 
its first accident. 
</P>
<P>
	It happened in the first lap of the first 125-mile qualifying  
race, when Wally Dallenbach went low and slid into Kenny Wallace, 
triggering a five-car accident that knocked Dan Pardus and John 
Andretti out of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a pretty sad story, because we weren't even going 160  
mph,'' said Andretti, who finished 27th but still made the Daytona 
500 based on his qualifying time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess the guy didn't know the difference between the apron  
and the racetrack. I figured we would at least get to the second 
turn before somebody tried something crazy'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dallenbach said he didn't know what to do other than drop down a  
lane to avoid Wallace. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't back off and let him in,'' Dallenbach said. ``I'd  
get drilled in the rear. Four or five cars were behind me. There 
was no way I could get out of it and let him in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dallenbach and Wallace also made the Daytona 500 based on their  
qualifying times, but Pardus needed to finish in the top 15 to make 
the race. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	NOT YOUR DAD'S DAYTONA: The founders of NASCAR and Daytona  
International Speedway wouldn't believe this sight: a 
57,200-square-foot tent outside the track where big-spenders can 
eat, drink and watch racing. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospitality tent is the latest in International Speedway  
Corp.'s effort to lure corporate money and fans who haven't 
traditionally been associated with NASCAR. 
</P>
<P>
	For $1,700 per person, fans can buy memberships to the Daytona  
Club. That includes access throughout Speed Weeks to the tent, 
where they offer breakfast, heavy hors d'ourves and dessert, as 
well as sanctuary from rain, wind or hot weather. 
</P>
<P>
	And this is no normal tent.  
</P>
<P>
	It covers approximately 1 1/2 acres, has air conditioning and a  
sound system. Club officials say it's the largest tent of its kind 
in the United States. It was assembled in one day, not including 
the huge drainage ditches dug at all four corners to contain 
rainwater. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a live band, two big-screen TVs and seating for up to  
2,000 guests. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen bartenders and 10 chefs work the tent. Among other  
items, they go through 2,500 eggs and 2,500 meatballs per day -- a 
far cry from the days of ``dirty-water hot dogs'' and Pepsi in the 
infield. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	BEER MONEY: Penske Racing South has signed a three-year contract  
extension with Miller that will keep the principle sponsor on Rusty 
Wallace's Fords through 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	The current contract was scheduled to end following the 2000  
season, but Wallace said a meeting several weeks ago in Milwaukee 
produced the new pact as well as a promise from Miller that it will 
continue to sponsor the 1989 Winston Cup champion as long as he 
races. 
</P>
<P>
	The 42-year-old Wallace said, ``I'm not going to be one of those  
guys who's going to keep on racing after he can't win no more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel real comfortable. I've taken all the questions from  
everybody about when you don't win you're too old and when you do 
you're young again. I went through all that. I feel really good. I 
promise you, the day I quit, five or six years from now, I'm not 
going to keep on going and not win. I still feel like I can win 
them all right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	BIG BROTHER: Mark Martin and his sponsor, Valvoline, announced a  
partnership with Big Brothers Big Sisters of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's Winston Cup series runner-up said he will make a  
cash donation to the organization for every lap he leads, every 
pole he wins and each trip he makes to the winner's circle during 
this year's Winston Cup events. 
</P>
<P>
	Valvoline also will sponsor fund raisers at events, contributing  
$1 for each fan who stops by. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal is to raise $1 million and find 10,000 new volunteer  
mentors for children.

<HEADLINE> Dragging-Death Case Jury Selected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- Seven men and five women have been chosen  
to decide the fate of a suspected white supremacist who could face 
the death penalty in the dragging death of a black man. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Guy James Gray said Wednesday that he was  
barred from commenting about the panel, but added: ``It is not an 
all-white jury.'' Jurors weren't present in the courtroom 
Wednesday, and during the selection they were referred to only by 
number. 
</P>
<P>
	John King, 24, and two other white men are accused of killing  
James Byrd Jr., 49, by chaining him to a pickup truck in June and 
dragging him nearly three miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Jasper is nearly half black, the racial makeup of the  
county -- the source of potential jurors -- is only 18 percent black. 
Just seven people in the 50-member pool were black, creating the 
possibility that King could have gotten an all-white jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have portrayed King as the ringleader. The other  
suspects, Shawn Berry, 23, and Lawrence Brewer, 31, will be tried 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening statements in King's trial are scheduled to begin  
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Reno: No Comment on Starr </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno, without  
commenting directly on reports that her department is probing 
possible prosecutorial missteps by Independent Counsel Kenneth 
Starr, pledged today there would be no interference with his 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	At her weekly news conference, Reno repeatedly parried questions  
about news reports saying the Justice Department would investigate 
whether Starr overstepped his boundaries in the early days of the 
Monica Lewinsky investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I have said all along, I try not to comment with respect to  
the independent counsel's function,'' Reno told reporters. ``I 
will, however, continue to look to see how I may comment in a way 
that is fair to all concerned, consistent with the law and 
consistent with ethical considerations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno seemed somewhat frustrated that she could not go further.  
</P>
<P>
	``If I can determine a way to properly make a comment concerning  
this matter that would be fair to all concerned and would adhere to 
the law, I will do so,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the attorney general did say no one would impede Starr's  
continuing work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have tried my level best to do this the right way, to ensure  
that there was no effort whatsoever to interfere with his 
investigation,'' she said, ``and I am convinced that nothing has 
been done, but I will continue to work to ensure that result.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the law establishing independent counsels for some  
political cases, the attorney general cannot take any disciplinary 
action against the prosecutor short of firing. Reno has stated that 
she would not undertake an investigation of an independent counsel 
unless the charges were severe enough to merit firing. 
</P>
<P>
	Several news organizations, including The Associated Press,  
reported this week that the Justice Department has advised Starr it 
intends to investigate the actions of his office, including the 
Jan. 16, 1998, offer to Ms. Lewinsky of an immunity deal 
conditioned on her not discussing it with her lawyer, Frank Carter.

<HEADLINE> Alps Avalanche Search Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHAMONIX, France (AP) -- Rescue workers today pulled out the  
frozen body of the 11th victim of a powerful avalanche in the 
French Alps and continued searching for another person presumed 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures dropped well below freezing overnight, leaving  
rescuers little hope of finding anyone else alive under the snow 
and rubble three days after the worst avalanche in the Chamonix 
valley in 91 years. 
</P>
<P>
	A new avalanche slightly damaged a chalet near Chamonix early  
today and a hotel had to be evacuated. The snowslide blocked a 
highway leading to the popular snow resort. 
</P>
<P>
	The danger of fresh avalanches remained high. Snow was still  
falling in parts of Europe, including in the French Riviera and in 
Rome, where snow last fell in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescue workers were using sensors and dogs to search to look for  
the dead and the missing. 
</P>
<P>
	This morning, they pulled out the 11th victim, a woman whose  
frozen body was lodged in the snow against a chalet that had been 
destroyed by the force of the avalanche. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors recalled the horror of the avalanches that roared down  
a mountainside between the villages of Le Tour and 
Montroc-le-Planet in the French Alps, 30 miles southeast of Geneva, 
piling snow as high as 24 feet in some places. 
</P>
<P>
	Nathan Wallace had just sat down on the sofa with his  
girlfriend, snuggling in for a cozy afternoon at their ski chalet. 
</P>
<P>
	Then his world imploded.  
</P>
<P>
	``Suddenly the windows turned black and a cloud of snow came  
in,'' he told The Associated Press. ``We were thrown into the 
corner and the roof collapsed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cowering under broken beams, the 28-year-old ski writer from  
Mammoth Lakes, Calif., and his girlfriend Alicia Boice, 21, waited 
for two hours before hearing the crunch of footsteps nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	They were among more than 20 people pulled out from under tons  
of snow after the worst avalanches in 91 years struck near 
Chamonix. At least 10 people were killed, including four children, 
and 17 chalets were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace and Boice had huddled on the floor by a closet, grabbing  
warm clothes as they prepared for the ordeal ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Luckily we were in a good spot at the time of the avalanche,''  
he said. ``If we'd been in the kitchen or the bathroom, we'd be 
dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 12-year-old boy was found shivering in the snow. His parents,  
both dead, lay nearby. He was being treated for hypothermia at 
Chamonix Hospital, and police said his life was not in danger. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies of a French ski guide and his girlfriend were located  
under a drift, but remained beyond the reach of rescuers, worker 
Blaise Agresti said. 
</P>
<P>
	Warnings of new avalanches closed ski slopes throughout the  
valley, deserted by thousands of skiers who made their way out. 
</P>
<P>
	In the French resort of Courchevel, rescuers found the body of a  
28-year-old skier from New Zealand who was swept away while skiing 
off marked trails, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Snow kept falling in other parts of Europe, forcing evacuations  
and stranding thousands in Switzerland, Austria and Germany. Snow 
even fell on the fabled French Riviera. 
</P>
<P>
	In Rome, falling snow was the cause of a score of traffic  
accidents. In the city's historic center, snowflakes melted as the 
reached the ground but cars from the suburbs were covered with 
snow. 
</P>
<P>
	Hungary has been suffocated by the snow over the past two days.  
Blizzards have dropped six feet of snow in some places, and train 
service has stopped in most parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The army has been put on alert as more snow is expected, and  
schools have been closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Many roads in Switzerland remained closed Thursday as a  
precaution against further avalanches.

	DETROIT (AP) -- One small step is a big deal for former Detroit  
Lions offensive guard Mike Utley. He'll take it Monday -- his first 
step in public since a debilitating injury more than seven years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	While he was moving to block another player in a game at the  
Silverdome on Nov. 17, 1991, Utley lost his balance, sending his 
6-foot-6, 315-pound body down on his head and neck, crushing his 
sixth and seventh vertebrae. 
</P>
<P>
	Utley, 33, is expected to take his first public steps Monday in  
Phoenix, flanked by two friends -- Lions linebacker Rob Fredrickson 
and former NFL center Bill Lewis -- with a handful of reporters as 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``My job now has been to work hard to get back on my feet  
again,'' Utley said Thursday in a statement. ``Just recently, I 
have accomplished what some doctors told me was impossible. I stood 
up and took a few steps. This injury does change you if you let it. 
I won't let it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another Lions player severely injured during a game, linebacker  
Reggie Brown, also has made quite a comeback. Brown's playing 
career was cut short when he was injured during the Lions' game 
against the New York Jets on Dec. 21, 1997. Tests showed he 
suffered a bruise to the two bones in his cervical spinal cord. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people would never be able to walk again -- or could die --  
from such an injury. Brown wore a halo for three months, but he was 
walking just two days after the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	And although Utley was told he probably would never walk again,  
he never quit trying. 
</P>
<P>
	He learned to move in a wheelchair and with crutches. He learned  
to drive a specially equipped car, to ski and to skydive. He lifted 
weights to keep his upper body strong. And he vowed someday to 
walk. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Utley suffered what is considered an incomplete injury,  
he has been able to regain some feeling in his extremities and to a 
certain extent some use of his legs. 
</P>
<P>
	``In view of that and in view of the fact Mike has been busting  
his butt in the gym seven days a week for the last several years, 
he's to the point where he's regaining some movement,'' Utley's 
publicist, Allison Ward, told the Detroit Free Press on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is really just a story of gritting it out. He has never  
given up, and he is one of the most physically healthy guys out 
there who has been injured in the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the progress has occurred in the past month, Ward said.  
Utley has tested his ability to walk -- a step or two at a time -- 
wearing shoes with leg braces. Ward said he's now ready to go 
public with his improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not saying that he's walking,'' she said. ``The term he's  
using is that he's `taking steps,' which is a long way from 
actually walking but is a huge improvement and a huge show of 
determination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two months after his injury, Utley formed the Mike Utley  
Foundation to raise money for research, rehabilitation and 
educational programs on spinal cord injuries. He holds several 
fund-raising events, sells ``Thumbs Up'' merchandise, and gives 
inspirational speeches to schools, hospitals and conventions. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we want to do with this is not to say to every  
quadriplegic in America, if you work as hard as Mike, you too can 
walk,'' Ward said.

<HEADLINE> Sybase Outburst Costs Agassi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- What separates cursing at yourself in  
frustration from uttering obscenities that get you tossed out of a 
tennis tournament? Andre Agassi, ejected from the Sybase Open, says 
officials overreacted to his comments. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi, leading by a set but trailing in a second-set tiebreaker  
against 120th-ranked Cecil Mamiit, was defaulted from a tournament 
for the second time in his career Wednesday night for a series of 
profanities. 
</P>
<P>
	The default will cost him $13,000 and a loss of rankings points  
that could drop him one or two places from his No. 7 world ranking. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi said the curses were directed at himself and that he  
covered his mouth with his hand when he said the last two of his 
three obscenities. ATP tour supervisor Tom Barnes said the curses 
were aimed at linesman Al Klassen. 
</P>
<P>
	``The words I used weren't singling him out at all. To default  
because one linesman thinks I'm making something personal with him 
is a bit of a stretch,'' Agassi said. ``The judgment was made that 
the line was crossed. I don't think the line was crossed. I wasn't 
even making eye contact with the linesman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi, seeded second, won the first set 6-0 in just 18 minutes  
against Mamiit, a qualifier who had never made it past the second 
round of an ATP tour event. But in the second-set tiebreaker, 
trailing four points to none, a frustrated Agassi began cursing. 
</P>
<P>
	Klassen went to chair umpire Steve Ullrich to report Agassi's  
first comment, and Agassi was warned for an audible obscenity. As 
Klassen returned to his chair, Agassi waited until Klassen got 
close and made a muffled comment. 
</P>
<P>
	He was penalized a point for another audible obscenity. Agassi  
said he knew the next such violation would result in default. 
</P>
<P>
	But as Klassen returned to his chair a second time, Agassi  
repeated his previous comment and Barnes was called to the court. 
He conferred with Ullrich, who penalized Agassi for verbal abuse 
and defaulted him -- awarding the second-round match to a stunned 
Mamiit, who pleaded with Ullrich to continue play. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the hook. Three and you're done,'' Agassi said.  
``That's all you get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Chang said all players are aware of the rules about  
defaulting on the third violation, though he was somewhat surprised 
at Agassi's ejection. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not an easy decision to make,'' said Chang, the  
tournament's fourth seed. ``Andre's such a great draw in San Jose 
and you don't want to lose a guy like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tournament director Barry MacKay also was stunned at the exit of  
his best gate attraction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, it's a big disappointment,'' MacKay said. ``It was  
shaping up to be a great match. I wasn't listening, so I didn't 
hear what Andre said. I'm for enforcing all the rules, but I think 
they were a little quick, frankly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes announced Thursday that Agassi will be fined $7,500 for  
the outburst and will forfeit the $5,500 in prize money he would 
have gotten for reaching the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the way you ever want to go out of a tournament,''  
Agassi said. ``I'm not too happy about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second default of Agassi's career. He was ejected  
from the RCA Championships in Indianapolis in 1996 for cursing 
officials during a match against Daniel Nestor in which Agassi also 
won the first set and was struggling in the second. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi made a remarkable comeback last year, jumping from No.  
122 in the world at the end of 1997 to No. 6 at the end of 1998 -- 
the biggest one-year jump into the Top 10 in ATP rankings history. 
</P>
<P>
	But he was listless in a loss to Vince Spadea in the fourth  
round of the Australian Open last month, a match in which Agassi 
admits he played uninspired tennis. Though he won his first-round 
match easily at the Sybase Open, Agassi may simply be 
psychologically drained from his battle back to the top echelon of 
tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think most of the top guys were pretty tired by the end of  
last year,'' Chang said. ``Andre has taken quite a bit of pounding 
over the last year to get his ranking up.''

<HEADLINE> Interest Rate Falls on 30-year Bond </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds fell in  
Thursday's auction to the lowest level on record. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield was 5.298 percent, down from 5.300 percent at the last  
auction on Nov. 5. It was the lowest rate since regular issuance of 
30-year bonds began in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	The notes will carry a coupon interest rate of 5 1/4 percent with  
each $10,000 in face value selling for $9,928.20. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of $10 billion in bonds were sold out of bids totaling  
$20.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Treasury Department sold 65-day cash management  
bills at a discount rate of 4.48 percent. The discount rate 
understates the actual return to investors -- 4.58 percent with a 
$10,000 bill selling for $9,919.10. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of $8 billion in bills were sold out of bids totaling  
$29.9 billion.

<HEADLINE> Cargo Ship Set on Fire in Oregon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOS BAY, Ore. (AP) -- In a thunderous flash of orange flames,  
demolition experts using plastic explosives and napalm set fire to 
a mired cargo ship Thursday night in an attempt to save Oregon's 
beaches from a disastrous spill of fuel oil. 
</P>
<P>
	The flames from the 639-foot New Carissa soared hundreds of feet  
into the night sky, followed by an acrid black smoke that poured 
from open cargo holds and drifted up the coast. The steel hull 
glowed bright red. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 600 gallons of napalm and 400 pounds of explosives --  
including battlefield torpedoes, shaped charges and firehouse bombs 
-- were set off at once for maximum burning power. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to go for this all or nothing,'' said Coast Guard Capt.  
Mike Hall. ``Every gallon that is burned in the fire is a gallon 
that is not on the shore of the coast of Oregon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The blasts ruptured the fuel tanks, filling the cargo holds with  
the molasses-like fuel oil. Crews ignited C-4 plastic explosives 
that touched off the extremely flammable napalm gel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got all the pyrotechnics Hollywood could possibly want,''  
said Roger Scott, one of 200 onlookers who reacted with oohs and 
ahhs to the explosion. ``I just hope it burns it all off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is no guarantee the ship will stay together for the days  
it could take to burn, but authorities said they were not worried 
about a widespread spill. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if sections do break apart, the fire will continue to  
consume the oil, even if it's on the surface of the water,'' said 
Lt. Scott Wilson, head of the Navy demolitions team. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Bill Milwee, a spokesman for the ship's owner: ``We think --  
no, we don't think it, we know -- what we did was the best option 
for the environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese-owned freighter ran aground Feb. 4 about 150 yards  
offshore with nearly 400,000 gallons of fuel aboard. It began 
leaking Monday as pounding waves widened the cracks in its hull. 
</P>
<P>
	With an approaching storm threatened to tear the ship apart with  
70 mph winds, federal and state authorities decided to burn the 
vessel and its fuel -- something never before attempted in the Lower 
48 states -- rather than risk trying to bring the New Carissa out 
intact. 
</P>
<P>
	The first attempt Wednesday night using grenades and buckets of  
gasoline fizzled with only a flash of flame and a plume of oily 
black smoke. 
</P>
<P>
	But the approaching gale slowed, and the revised forecast said a  
weakened storm would move ashore late Thursday with rain and winds 
of no more than 45 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration experts have  
said an oil spill could, in a worst-case scenario, coat 50 to 100 
miles of the coast. The oil could endanger threatened sea lions and 
shorebirds. 
</P>
<P>
	About 350 workers have been mobilized to scrape up the oil and  
watch for fouled wildlife. Several soiled birds have been found, 
and harvesting of clams and mussels has been banned.

<HEADLINE> American Cancels 1,170 Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A federal judge will hear a contempt motion today  
against the American Airlines pilots union after their job action 
continued despite a back-to-work order. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of the Fort Worth, Texas-based carrier's flights  
were canceled Thursday as the airline's problems with the 
disgruntled pilots union grew. Pilots continued to call in sick and 
refused to fly overtime, leaving thousands of passengers stranded 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	In Miami, Lucia Bernan and her 4-year-old daughter Melanie were  
trying to figure out how to get back home to Caracas after their 
flight was canceled.. 
</P>
<P>
	``My flight was supposed to go out at 10:30 and here I am. I  
don't know what's going to happen,'' said Bernan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's incredible to me how such a prestigious company could do  
something like this ... Everything is so disorganized that it's 
extremely hard to believe this is actually happening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots are angry over the integration of recently purchased Reno  
Air, which has resulted in disparities in pay. 
</P>
<P>
	American pilots are barred by federal law from striking over the  
issue, but federal regulations do require individual pilots to call 
in sick if they think they are under undue emotional stress. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall ordered an end to  
the ``sickout'' job action that has been going on since last 
Saturday, but that seemed to have little effect. He has scheduled a 
hearing for this morning in his Dallas court on a request by 
American to hold the Allied Pilots Association in contempt. 
</P>
<P>
	According to American, 1,170 of its 2,250 scheduled flights were  
canceled Thursday, the most in one day since the job action began. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're surprised by the conduct of the union leadership,'' said  
John Hotard, a spokesman for AMR Corp., the parent of American. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Jim Philpot, a spokesman for the union, said, however,  
that the APA is complying with the temporary restraining order. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are meeting or exceeding the judge's requirements,'' said  
Philpot. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, more than 3,800 flights have been canceled since  
Saturday, affecting the plans of more than 380,000 travelers. AMR 
said its American Eagle flights have not been affect by the job 
action. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers attempting to reschedule or get refunds through the  
company's reservation desk found their calls disconnected by the 
overloaded system or forced to wait on hold for an agent. 
</P>
<P>
	For those with low-priority tickets, it has been especially  
trying. 
</P>
<P>
	George and Midge Griffin of Cincinnati had been at Chicago's  
O'Hare International Airport since Wednesday trying to get a flight 
to Ecuador to visit their daughter. They'd purchased discount 
tickets from a relative who works for American, and that gave their 
travel plans a lower priority than those holding full-price 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're at the bottom of the barrel,'' George Griffin bemoaned.  
</P>
<P>
	The couple had been bumped three times in their efforts to get  
on a flight to Miami on Wednesday and had finally given up. They 
were trying unsuccessfully Thursday to get a flight back to 
Cincinnati and planned to reschedule their trip in September. 
</P>
<P>
	This isn't the first time the Allied Pilots Association has  
ignored a judge's ruling. During a similar dispute in 1990, 
hundreds of pilots called in sick after being ordered back to work. 
</P>
<P>
	American pilots have had a contentious relationship with company  
management for the past decade. Two years ago when contract talks 
failed, the pilots went on strike for a few minutes until they were 
called back to work by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't surprise me that we are having more trouble. As  
long as AMR management uses this confrontational approach, it is 
not likely to get better,'' said Capt. Neil Ekblaw, an American 
pilot based out of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if everybody heeded the judge's order, travelers shouldn't  
expect smooth holiday travels. There will be more cancellations as 
the company works to get planes and crews moved to the cities where 
flights are scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots say the disagreement is as much over the contract, the  
outsourcing of jobs and past management decisions as it is about 
Reno Air pilots' pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Reno pilots make half the $164,000 a year that an  
experienced American pilot makes. The American pilots want AMR to 
add Reno pilots to the higher pay scale more quickly, and want some 
of their own to move up the ladder. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR said that it will take about 12 to 18 months do that and the  
pilot union's demands would cost as much as $50 million this year.

<HEADLINE> Eagles' Mamula Signs 4-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Eagles re-signed defensive  
end Mike Mamula to a four-year contract worth between $11 million 
and $12 million plus incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	Mamula 25, missed all of last season injuring his knee in the  
second exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the seventh pick of the 1995 draft but never recorded  
more than eight sacks in a season. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tom Modrak, the Eagles' director of football operations,  
said Thursday that the team looked at all the available 
pass-rushing ends, ``and Mike has as much ability as any of the 
guys who are in that group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mamula started 45 games during his first three NFL seasons  
before suffering a torn anterior cruciate ligament and torn 
cartilage in his right knee during the Eagles' second preseason 
game against Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Modrak said Mamula will be ready in time for training camp this  
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``His progress, his rehabilitation, has been very positive ...  
He's been great, he's worked extremely hard. He seems to have a 
better appreciation of what football means to him. Mike's hungry,'' 
Modrak said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mamula, who was scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent  
on Friday, said he's gratified that the team has offered him 
another chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``It let's me know this organization wants me to be here. And I  
want to be here. This is my home. I'm getting married in June and 
want to start a family here,'' Mamula said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mamula will be paired with defensive end Hugh Douglas, who had  
12 1/2 sacks last season and was one of the few bright spots on an 
otherwise dismal team. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles also announced the signing of fourth-year linebacker  
Dana Howard.

<HEADLINE> Internet Romances Thrive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Josh Crump and Louisa Greaves fell in  
love -- true, romantic, drippy and passionate love -- over the 
Internet. They chatted in private virtual rooms, delivered bouquets 
with a click of a button and peppered each other with hundreds of 
digital greeting cards. 
</P>
<P>
	For the young couple, who will celebrate their first Valentine's  
Day as husband and wife this year in London, Canada, the Internet 
was an easy way to meet each other. 
</P>
<P>
	For Internet merchants, relationships like this one are easy  
ways to make money. From the moment the two logged on -- he in 
Canada and she in Australia -- they were shown advertisements, 
offered deals and pitched products that were putting money in the 
pockets of e-commerce leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	From dating services to greeting cards, Internet merchants are  
cashing in on a new product this Valentine's Day: love. 
</P>
<P>
	Purchases of gifts and flowers online are expected to increase  
63 percent, bringing in $413 million this year, according to 
Forrester Research, Inc. in Cambridge, Mass. Jewelry will be a $78 
million Internet industry, said Forrester, and dating services 
expect to see $25 million in revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's not even touching adult online entertainment, an  
industry Forrester estimates brought in $185 million in revenues 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Love always sells,'' said Pam Stubing, a retail analyst at  
Ernst &AMP; Young. ``It could be a wonderful way to make money over the 
Web.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's what Carley Roney figured when she looked at the $35  
billion annual wedding industry. 
</P>
<P>
	She co-founded theknot.com in 1996 with her husband, David Liu,  
and two other partners. They began with $1.5 million in seed money 
from America Online and received another $3 million in venture 
capital a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Business is booming. They sign up 1,000 new members a day and  
expect $4.5 million in revenues this year as lovebirds log in to 
register for gifts, search through wedding gowns, browse honeymoon 
ideas and consult Ms. Roney herself for etiquette advice. 
</P>
<P>
	The money comes from revenues from gifts sold through the  
wedding registry and from advertisers who pay $35,000 to have their 
banner on the site for three months. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, before couples are ready to even visit theknot.com  
they have to meet. 
</P>
<P>
	That's where the dating services come in.  
</P>
<P>
	Three years ago savvy matchmakers formed Match.Com, now the top  
Internet dating service. They charge singles $12.95 a month to be 
screened and hooked up with potential heart mates. 
</P>
<P>
	Cupid apparently approves.  
</P>
<P>
	To date, Match.Com has registered more than 1.3 million members.  
So far, 150,000 couples have been formed and 750 couples have been 
married. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a lot of love, said Match.Com president John Spottiswood.  
</P>
<P>
	It's also a lot of money.  
</P>
<P>
	Guests not only meet each other through the site, they buy  
flowers, chocolates and gifts, leaving a percentage of the sales 
behind. Spottiswood would not discuss his company's revenues, but 
he estimates that the online matchmaking industry as a whole 
brought in $25 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In these days of burgeoning e-commerce, Spottiswood concedes  
that he could be selling anything -- books, software, shoes. So why 
love? 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet is better positioned to enable people to meet  
people who really fit than to help people find a shoe that fits,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hongjun Li, an Internet analyst at Parks Associates in Dallas,  
Texas, agreed that entrepreneurs launching a Web site shouldn't 
discount love. 
</P>
<P>
	``You make money with the advertising and the sales. You could  
make lots of money in this way,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	That was Tony Levitan's plan.  
</P>
<P>
	Levitan co-founded E-greetings in 1993 after graduating from  
business school at Stanford University. 
</P>
<P>
	At the E-greetings World Wide Web site, Internet love-surfers  
can send one another enhanced e-mail messages, complete with music 
and animation. The company gives the cards away for free -- their 
revenues comes from advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is expecting to send up to 5 million virtual  
Valentines this year. Levitan said he expects those senders to also 
make about 100,000 purchases from their advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lots of industries have been driven by the heart,'' he said.  
``Why not e-commerce?''

<HEADLINE> Flower Scent Can Help Kill Pests / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers in Texas are looking for a patent  
on an artificial flower scent that, coupled with an insecticide, 
can help lure and kill moths that prey on cotton and corn. 
</P>
<P>
	By using the artificial smell of the night-blooming Gaura plant,  
entomologist Juan Lopez and agricultural engineer Kenneth R. 
Beerwinkle at College Station, Texas, were able to attract corn, 
earworm and bollworm moths, which rely on the scent of plants to 
locate their favorite foods. 
</P>
<P>
	These moths, which feed off corn and then move onto cotton, cost  
farmers nearly $2 billion in losses and chemical control expenses 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
	After being attracted to the plant, the moths ate a fatal dose  
of carbaryl, a commonly used household insecticide. In a field 
study, 730 of the pests were killed in a 54-foot row of corn. More 
dead moths were found on the second night after treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	On the morning after the treatment, researchers also found  
insects that were probably eaten by predators. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientists, who work for the Agricultural Research Service,  
the chief research agency of the U.S. Agriculture Department, found 
that females ready to lay eggs in the silks of sweet corn or in 
cotton were especially attracted to the aroma. 
</P>
<P>
	But both sexes of several insect species were attracted.  
</P>
<P>
	Other researchers with the service in Charleston, S.C., and  
Ames, Iowa, have tested the attractant against melonworm, 
pickleworm, cabbage and soybean looper, and European corn borer. 
</P>
<P>
	The ARS has applied for a patent on the attractant, which can be  
used with a feeding stimulant and insecticide. The researchers are 
developing a cooperative research and development agreement with an 
industry partner to commercialize the technology. 
</P>

	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Consumers can get their share of Vitamin C  
and pay less for it in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department says it expects more Florida oranges  
than previously forecast. The USDA has raised slightly its estimate 
of the state's orange crop to 194 million boxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2 percent increase over the original prediction of 190  
million boxes is the result of mild winter. Each box contains 90 
pounds of oranges. 
</P>
<P>
	The warm, wet weather this winter has revived groves previously  
damaged by drought, floods and wind, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
	Orange juice futures prices tumbled 9 percent Thursday in New  
York, the second consecutive day of sharp losses. Orange juice for 
March delivery fell 8.2 cents to 84.05 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	The release of the updated forecast prompted frozen,  
concentrated orange juice prices to lose nearly 18 percent after 
two days. 
</P>
<P>
	The estimated amount of juice per box was increased to a record  
1.60 gallons, a figure that points to consumers being awash in 
cheap orange juice in coming months.

<HEADLINE> Young Inventor Gets $30,000 Prize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Daniel DiLorenzo was always  
experimenting as a child. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was 3, he tried to figure out electricity by reaching  
into a socket. Then he put his own blood under a microscope to 
check it out. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the inquisitive nature of the 32-year-old graduate  
student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology paid off as he 
was honored with a $30,000 prize for inventiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	DiLorenzo holds two patents and has two more pending. His  
inventions include a method to control brain swelling, several 
medical electronic devices and a device that helped a paraplegic 
patient to walk 60 feet with balance assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	His goal is to practice neurosurgery and develop other devices  
that will help people with artificial limbs. The native of Fort 
Washington, Md., plans to use some of his prize money to secure 
more patents. 
</P>
<P>
	It was DiLorenzo's track record of inventive behavior that made  
him stand out, said Annemarie Amparo, director of the Lemelson-MIT 
Student Prize. 
</P>
<P>
	The prize is awarded annually to an MIT student who demonstrates  
inventiveness and who serves as a role model for young people. 
DiLorenzo is the fifth winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm flattered to have the opportunity to try to encourage  
children to try to enter the field,'' he said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Inventors and scientists rarely are held up as role models  
because ``it may not have the entertainment value that other fields 
have.''

<HEADLINE> Ministers: Lyons Didn't Abuse Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARGO, Fla. (AP) -- The Rev. Henry Lyons put a huge down payment  
on a $700,000 home, bought a 5.5-carat diamond ring and spent 
lavishly on cars, furniture and clothing, prosecutors say. 
</P>
<P>
	But his peers testified Wednesday that he did not abuse church  
funds as president of the National Baptist Convention USA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot think of anything he did under this administration  
that the previous presidents did not have the privilege to do,'' 
the Rev. Lacy Curry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Curry was one of three convention ministers who testified as the  
defense began presenting evidence at Lyons' racketeering trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons and his alleged mistress, Bernice Edwards, are accused of  
swindling more than $4 million from companies hoping to sell 
cemetery products, life insurance policies and credit cards to 
convention members. 
</P>
<P>
	The convention voted to keep Lyons as president after Florida  
prosecutors began investigating his finances in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	A convention ethics commission reviewed Lyons' conduct, focusing  
only on whether he stole any money from its treasuries, and found 
nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what we zeroed in on and that's what we dealt with,  
mainly,'' said the Rev. Edward V. Hill, who led the commission. 
``We didn't want to go any further.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers say failed business deals are not criminal  
matters. They spent much of Wednesday presenting testimony from the 
ministers who said they believe Lyons has the right to earn profit 
from his post as president and to spend the money as he chooses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. H.L. Harvey agreed. He testified the convention claimed  
more than 8 million members years before Lyons became president. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have said an 8.5 million membership figure was a  
hoax -- and Lyons and Ms. Edwards used it to court companies seeking 
access to the group's members, promising them use of the 
convention's mailing list.

<HEADLINE> Judy Garland Duets Discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Judy Garland fans will soon be listening to a  
treasure trove of duets recently discovered in a New Jersey 
basement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The staggering collection of over 100 audio and video tapes  
were carefully moved to the West Coast and gradually digitally 
remastered,'' Sid Luft, her former husband and manager, said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The songs will be released on a $24.98 two-CD set called ``Judy  
Duets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For almost three decades, master tapes of Miss Garland's TV show  
duets with Barbra Streisand, Ethel Merman, Frank Sinatra, Dean 
Martin, Tony Bennett, Lena Horne and others were stored in the 
crawl space of a home owned by a onetime Luft business associate. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Garland died in 1969.

<HEADLINE> Park Won't Allow Bullock Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROANOKE, Va. (AP) -- Production plans for Sandra Bullock's new  
movie ``28 Days'' sounded like a two-month nuisance to the National 
Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The park service refused to allow filming of the $30 million  
romantic comedy along the scenic Blue Ridge Parkway because the 
movie company wants to build a two-story facade at the Peaks of 
Otter Lodge. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia TriStar Pictures wants to film between March 15 and May  
22, but parkway Superintendent Gary Everhardt said Thursday he was 
concerned because ``visitors would be looking at the backside of 
the facade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Ranger Gordon Wissinger wrote the movie company on Tuesday  
that the park service mission at Peaks of Otter ``is to provide a 
serene, peaceful, relaxing visitor experience within a pastoral 
landscape.'' The filming would be unacceptable, he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Wissinger said the Park Service would reconsider if the movie  
company came up with a plan that did not significantly alter the 
lodge.

<HEADLINE> Ho Chi Minh Poster Man Attacked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WESTMINSTER, Calif. (AP) -- A Vietnamese shopkeeper who won the  
right to display a poster of Ho Chi Minh in his store window faced 
hundreds of angry protesters and landed in the hospital after being 
struck in the face. 
</P>
<P>
	Truong Van Tran's wall-sized poster of the late communist leader  
outraged many in Little Saigon, home to 200,000 
Vietnamese-Americans. Some fled South Vietnam in 1975 after it fell 
to communist North Vietnam, and others left nearly a decade later 
when they were freed from prison camps. 
</P>
<P>
	An Orange County court on Wednesday held that Tran, 37, could  
display the poster, which protesters compared to hanging a portrait 
of Adolf Hitler in a Jewish neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Tran's display is undisputedly offensive and engenders  
hatred,'' said Judge Barbara Tam Nomoto Schumann. ``However, these 
symbols are part of political speech which Mr. Tran has a right to 
express even if the context of that expression is offensive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tran was on his way to re-hang the display when he was struck by  
a protester outside his Hi Tek video store. He fell to the ground 
and was taken to a hospital, where he complained of chest pain and 
remained overnight for observation. He was in fair condition this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second time Tran was attacked during a protest over  
his display. On Jan. 18, he was struck on the head but not 
seriously injured. He declined to file a complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	For a week after Tran first put up the poster, hundreds of  
protesters picketed the store, the mall's landlord sent him an 
eviction notice and the store was shut down. 
</P>
<P>
	The owner of the mall took the case to court, saying Tran was  
violating his lease agreement by disrupting other businesses. 
Schumann issued the temporary restraining order, making Tran remove 
the sign. 
</P>
<P>
	Tran, who arrived in the United States in 1980, told television  
crews earlier in the day that he is not a communist and does not 
support the communist leadership in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	``Communists killed my brother,'' Tran told KCBS-TV.  
</P>
<P>
	He held a small sign reading, ``Nothing is more precious than  
liberty,'' and said he wanted to use the poster to open a dialogue 
about what's happening in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	Tran had previously told police he displayed the poster because  
he wanted to antagonize neighboring businesses, said Lt. Mike 
Schlisky said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of demonstrators crammed the hallway outside the  
courtroom Wednesday, and several waited for Tran at his store. 
</P>
<P>
	``I lost my country and I lost my family because of this regime.  
I don't want any symbolism of communism in Little Saigon,'' said 
Bich Nguien. ``He has a right to freedom of speech, but he can't 
take advantage of the refugee community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stuart Parker, an attorney for the Vietnam Community of Southern  
California, said the judge's decision was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here is a clear and present danger to the community,'' Parker  
said. ``I see it as a victory for inflammatory speech.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Urged To Run for President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Current and past Republican members of  
Congress have launched a campaign to persuade Texas Gov. George W. 
Bush to run for president, saying his ``compassionate'' message 
will resonate with voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is the one that will appeal to the broadest spectrum of  
Americans,'' former Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., chairman of the 
Draft Bush 2000 Committee, aid Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that, by far, George Bush represents the best  
candidate the Republican Party can put forward for president next 
year,'' added former Rep. Guy Molinari, R-N.Y., president of the 
New York borough of Staten Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Solomon said about 75 people from all factions of the party  
attended a Capitol Hill meeting Tuesday, where they had a 
``serious, thoughtful discussion about the appeal of Governor Bush 
and his compassionate conservative message nationwide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has said he will decide by early April whether to enter the  
race. 
</P>
<P>
	Among likely GOP presidential candidates, he shares top billing  
with Elizabeth Dole, the former Red Cross president who also is 
exploring a possible candidacy.

<HEADLINE> Earnhardt Jr. Works in Dad's Shadow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- If the names weren't the same, it  
might be hard to tell that Dale Earnhardt and Dale Earnhardt Jr. 
are related. 
</P>
<P>
	One loves hunting and fishing; the other prefers MTV and the  
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	One gets his message across with an intimidating scowl through a  
thick, black mustache; the other has frosted blond hair and loves 
playing to the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing they have in common: the way they drive those race  
cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the 24-year-old Earnhardt Jr. won the Busch Grand  
National Series in his first full season on the circuit. He begins 
defense of the Busch title Saturday at the NAPA Auto Parts 300. 
</P>
<P>
	And today, there's an even more intriguing story line: the  
International Race of Champions Series, in which he will race 
against his father for just the second time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure, I'd like to beat him,'' Earnhardt Jr. said. ``But I'd  
like to beat them all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At an exhibition race in Japan last November, Earnhardt Jr.  
finished sixth and his dad finished eighth. Everybody loved it when 
the son bumped into his father about midway through the race, but 
Earnhardt Jr. downplayed the episode. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a bump, just tapped him a little bit, that's it,'' he  
said. ``No big deal. No family dispute came out of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt Jr. was just getting into the sport while his father  
was in the prime of his Winston Cup career in the late '80s and 
early '90s. 
</P>
<P>
	He credits his dad no more than any other driver for his  
success. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hardly ever saw him, because he was always traveling,''  
Earnhardt Jr. said. ``I learned by watching TV, or going to races 
and seeing how they do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The relationship has remained distant, mainly because of their  
hectic schedules. Of course, Earnhardt Jr., doesn't see much wrong 
with that. 
</P>
<P>
	How many 24-year-olds spend a lot of quality time with Dad  
anyway?, he asks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We get along fine,'' he said. ``We just don't have long-term  
discussions about my future, or how to drive cars, or how to build 
cars. We don't talk that stuff. We just don't have time to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the elder Earnhardt has kept an eye out for his son.  
</P>
<P>
	After watching him go through uneventful seasons with part-time  
rides on the Busch series in 1996 and '97, Dad decided to put Dale 
Jr. in the Busch car he owns. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a decision that surprised almost everyone, especially  
crew chief Tony Eury. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody looked at us like we were crazy,'' Eury has said.  
``They said there ain't no way we could take that kid and win a 
championship. He learned faster than anybody I've ever worked 
with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the first championship secured, Earnhardt Sr. has plans to  
move his son up to the Winston Cup series on a limited basis this 
season before he moves up full time next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt Jr. will drive the No. 8 car in Winston Cup races, the  
same number grandpa Ralph Earnhardt drove to the 1956 championship 
in the Sportsman division, the predecessor to the Busch Series. 
</P>
<P>
	The family ties don't end there. Also entered in Saturday's race  
is Dale's other son, 29-year-old Kerry, who has a part-time ride 
with another team. 
</P>
<P>
	``He actually started racing before Dale Jr. did,'' said  
Earnhardt Sr., who will defend his Daytona 500 title on Sunday. ``I 
definitely think he's got the talent. Hopefully, he can get a grasp 
on it. It would be great for Dale Jr. and Kerry to go on and win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Little Dale shares the sentiment.  
</P>
<P>
	``There would be nothing better than winning here,'' he said.  
``It would be huge. Especially if the No. 3 won on Sunday. Then, 
there would be a huge party back home.''

<HEADLINE> IOC Member Responds to Allegations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- IOC member Phil Coles of Australia  
criticized Salt Lake City's investigative panel on Thursday, saying 
allegations leveled against him in a report into the city's 
scandal-plagued Winter Olympics bid were unethical and immoral. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles stepped down Wednesday as a member of the organizing  
committee of the 2000 Sydney Games after being named in the report, 
which detailed how Salt Lake City had attempted to secure votes for 
the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The report named Coles and Willi Kaltschmitt of Guatemala as  
making four visits together, with their families, to the United 
States, in one instance attending the Super Bowl in Miami, hosted 
by bid leader Tom Welch, at a cost of $19,991. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said ``some IOC members treated their site visits  
more like vacations,'' and then discussed the cases of Coles and 
Kaltschmitt. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Coles and Kaltschmitt families stayed at expensive hotels  
. . . Two of these trips were only four months apart in 1995, 
including a Super Bowl trip that does not appear to have included a 
visit to Salt Lake City. Mr. Welch served as their host at the 
Super Bowl, the expenses were paid as reimbursements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement released after a day of meetings at his home with  
International Olympic Committee lawyer Simor Rofe, Coles said 
``this statement is wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coles said he made only one visit to Salt Lake City during the  
city's candidature, as permitted under the IOC's guidelines. The 
dates were Jan. 31 to Feb. 4, 1995, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that visit immediately followed the Super Bowl in Miami.  
Coles said he was asked to attend by Welch and was ``advised that I 
would be a guest of CBS and that Delta Airlines would be 
responsible for all air travel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coles and his partner attended, along with Rick Gentile,  
vice-president of sports production at CBS, Kaltschmitt and his 
wife and Welch and his family, Coles said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Apart from this official visit, I did not visit the United  
States at all during the candidature,'' Coles said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had visited Salt Lake City on several occasions since  
the Games were awarded in June 1995. A keen skier, Coles said these 
visits were holidays. 
</P>
<P>
	``In respect of these post-bid visits, I have paid for all the  
airfares for myself and my family,'' Coles said. Accommodation had 
been provided by U.S. IOC member Jim Easton and ``friends or 
sponsors of the 2002 Olympic Winter Games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coles said the inaccuracy of the ethics report must be  
attributed to ``its failure to advise me of its findings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had been given the opportunity to correct the board's  
misunderstandings before it publicly denigrated me, then no doubt 
it would have corrected its report and spared me and my family a 
great deal of heartache and anguish,'' Coles said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The board of ethics has acted in a most unethical and immoral  
manner in defaming me by making serious and unfounded allegations 
and subjected me and my family to trial by media,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sydney radio Friday, Coles said the only thing missing from  
his recent media treatment over the Salt Lake City report was the 
``guillotine in the city square.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing that totally, what I call un-Australian anyway, is  
the way the press, the tabloid media, attacked me also without even 
hesitating to question the report,'' Coles said. ``In other words 
the report was taken as gospel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coles said he had written ``a full and honest account'' for IOC  
president Juan Antonio Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles was reported as saying earlier Thursday that he had kept  
full records of his visits to the United States and would make them 
available for inspection by the IOC if requested.

<HEADLINE> Polar Clouds Contain Nitric Acid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The first analysis of clouds high above the  
Arctic -- where the protective ozone layer is being damaged -- shows 
they contain water and nitric acid. 
</P>
<P>
	Nitric acid sucks up more active forms of nitrogen that can  
damage the ozone. But finding it in the clouds indicates that it is 
condensing out of the upper air, allowing conditions to develop 
that help create the ozone hole, scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
	The polar stratospheric clouds, nine to 15 miles above the  
Earth's surface, provide a place where chemical reactions occur in 
which chlorine attacks and destroys ozone. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, German scientists have sent a balloon up to sample the  
clouds and provide the first analysis of what they contain. 
</P>
<P>
	What they found was water -- normal for clouds -- and nitric acid,  
researchers from the Max Planck Institute of Nuclear Physics in 
Heidelberg report in Friday's issue of the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	The presence of nitric acid had been suspected in the past, but  
never measured, the team headed by Jochen Schreiner said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ozone layer protects the Earth from dangerous ultraviolet  
radiation from the sun. Those rays can cause skin cancer, eye 
damage, skin wrinkling and premature aging. 
</P>
<P>
	A thinning of this protective layer was first noticed over  
Antarctica, and a weakening of the layer to a lesser degree has now 
been detected over the Arctic. An increase in ultraviolet radiation 
in the more heavily populated northern countries could be dangerous 
to many people. 
</P>
<P>
	This threat led to the 1989 Montreal agreement to eliminate  
chlorofluorocarbons that rise into the air and destroy ozone. Even 
with that ban, large amounts of CFCs remain in the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	Nitrogen is the most common gas in the atmosphere and several  
active nitrogen compounds, including nitrous acid, can damage the 
ozone themselves, said Konrad Mauersberger of the Max Planck 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Nitric acid is a relatively stable ``sink'' for those more  
active forms, soaking them up and eventually settling to lower 
levels and raining out of the air, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The actual measurement of the polar clouds is important because  
it helps researchers forecast ozone changes in the upper air, 
Mauersberger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists have not been able to directly analyze the  
composition of polar stratospheric clouds previously, though some 
earlier aircraft flights provided indirect evidence that nitric 
acid and water were present, Mauersberger said. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers launched their high-altitude balloon from  
Kiruna, Sweden.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer's Rates Low in Clinton Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The lawyering in President Clinton's trial is  
being rated as sometimes less than brilliant -- but it may not make 
a difference. 
</P>
<P>
	One mistake by House prosecutors was ``fielding 13 people  
without any obvious coordination,'' says University of Virginia law 
professor A.E. Dick Howard. 
</P>
<P>
	Allowing all of the prosecutors to speak to the Senate  
``diffused the impact of what they had to say,'' Howard said, while 
the smaller White House defense team's lawyers ``were clearly 
confident on this turf. In a closer case, it might have made a 
difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The House managers each wanted their moment in the sun,'' said  
Charles Geyh, director of the American Judicature Society's center 
for judicial independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal observers also say House prosecutors should have called  
presidential secretary Betty Currie to testify, and Independent 
Counsel Kenneth Starr shouldn't have helped prosecutors arrange to 
meet Monica Lewinsky before her sworn questioning. 
</P>
<P>
	But University of Southern California law professor Erwin  
Chemerinsky thinks the legal advocacy hasn't mattered at all. ``If 
the lawyers hadn't uttered a word, the votes in the House and 
Senate would have been the same,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	There were some high-water marks. White House counsel Charles  
Ruff, former Sen. Dale Bumpers and House prosecutor Asa Hutchinson 
were praised for their clear, well-argued Senate presentations. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hutchinson's opening argument also contained what some  
lawyers call one of the trial's biggest blunders. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson said presidential friend Vernon Jordan intensified  
efforts to find Ms. Lewinsky a job after a judge's ruling on Dec. 
11, 1997, increased the likelihood she would have to testify in 
Paula Jones' sex-harassment lawsuit against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Ruff showed that Jordan's job-seeking efforts on Ms.  
Lewinsky's behalf occurred hours before, not after, the judge's 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson got his revenge a few days later, pointing out that  
Ruff erred in saying Mrs. Currie was never a prospective witness in 
the Jones case. Actually, Mrs. Currie was added to the Jones 
witness list shortly after Clinton questioned her on whether he was 
ever alone with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Bumpers' speech to the Senate in Clinton's defense was a high  
point in the trial because he ``was the only one who could get away 
with basically talking to these people as peers,'' said Geyh, who 
also is an Indiana University law professor. 
</P>
<P>
	Some low points, according to legal observers:  
</P>
<P>
	--House prosecutors' decision not to call Mrs. Currie as a  
witness. If she were pressed on whether she contacted Ms. Lewinsky 
to pick up gifts Clinton had given her, ``that really could have 
caused things to unravel,'' said Georgetown law professor Louis 
Michael Seidman. 
</P>
<P>
	--Starr's intervention in the trial, by getting a court order  
that required Ms. Lewinsky to meet with prosecutors before the 
Senate decided whether to call her as a witness. There also were 
news reports during the trial that Starr had concluded Clinton 
could be charged with a crime while in office. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Senate's decision to start the trial without working out  
the procedures in advance. Geyh recommends senators reconsider the 
procedures later, adding, ``They could make it less of a 
free-for-all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York lawyer Gerald Lefcourt said the best presentation by  
the House prosecutors came near the end, when they were able to 
illustrate their case with the videotaped sworn statements by Ms. 
Lewinsky, Jordan and Clinton aide Sidney Blumenthal. But it was too 
late to make a difference, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia lawyer Lawrence Fox said the prosecutors did well,  
considering they were hamstrung by being allowed to call only three 
witnesses, presented on videotape instead of live. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's team was ``brilliant'' to use a diverse group of  
lawyers -- including two women, one of them black -- in contrast to 
the 13 white men representing the House, Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have known for a very long time that they didn't have  
anything to worry about'' as long as they made no major mistakes, 
Fox said.

<HEADLINE> AOL, Microsoft Testimony Differs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A senior Microsoft Corp. executive testified  
that superior technology, not illegal business tactics, prompted 
America Online to abandon Netscape's Internet browser for the one 
made by Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	In written testimony released Wednesday, Microsoft Vice  
President Brad Chase challenged the claims of AOL executive David 
Colburn, who testified earlier in the computer software giant's 
antitrust trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Colburn had said Microsoft promised to put an AOL icon on the  
Windows desktop, the first screen a person sees after turning on a 
computer. Desktop placement -- and its potential to attract 
thousands of customers -- was the main reason AOL signed its 1996 
contract with Microsoft, Colburn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chase disagreed. He said a week after signing the deal, he spoke  
to Colburn about why AOL chose Microsoft over Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	``While placement in the online services may also have been  
important, Mr. Colburn focused on different issues, making it clear 
that AOL would not have chosen Microsoft as its supplier of Web 
browsing software if we had not (had) superior technology,'' said 
Chase, who was expected to undergo cross-examination today. 
</P>
<P>
	In his direct testimony, Chase denied that Microsoft required  
AOL to prevent its subscribers from using Netscape software. 
Instead, he said, the company set limits on ways AOL could give it 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	``If 100 percent of AOL's subscribers converted to Netscape  
Navigator because that is what they decided to use, AOL would not 
be in breach of any term,'' Chase wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The testimony appears to contradict admissions made in court  
Wednesday by Chase's colleague, Cameron Myrhvold, who heads 
Microsoft's Internet service unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Under cross-examination, Myrhvold said his company asked AOL and  
other Internet service providers to exclusively distribute 
Microsoft's browser ``so we wouldn't lose those side-by-side 
choices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The details were revealed as Myhrvold was questioned about an  
AOL contract that requires at least 85 percent of its customers to 
use Microsoft's Internet Explorer, or ``IE'' browser. 
</P>
<P>
	Government attorney David Boies introduced an e-mail sent to  
Myhrvold by another executive that showed the number of AOL 
customers who used IE jumping from 2 million to 12 1/2 million within 
a year when ``AOL force fed the browser to America Online base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boies asked Myhrvold several times about Microsoft's motives  
behind its restrictive contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	``You were concerned if you presented users with a choice,  
side-by-side, they would pick the Netscape browser rather than 
yours?'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, that's right,'' Myhrvold said. ``We were nowhere. We were  
the Johnny-come-lately of the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Microsoft felt Netscape had ``mind share,'' or name  
recognition. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would lose many of those decisions if we had to compete  
side-by-side,'' Myhrvold said. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet service providers often signed contracts requiring them  
to distribute Microsoft browsers in exchange for a place on the 
Windows desktop. The companies were allowed to ship different 
browsers but only if requested by a customer -- and only if the 
total number shipped was less than 25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In its antitrust lawsuit, the government claims Microsoft used  
its monopoly power and illegal tactics to crush and discourage 
competition.

<HEADLINE> Census Takers Could Receive Welfare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Welfare recipients would be able to hold  
temporary census jobs without fear of losing government benefits 
under a new legislative proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., head of the House panel that oversees  
the census, said Wednesday the bill he introduced with Rep. Carrie 
Meeks, D-Fla., is aimed at getting a more accurate count for the 
2000 census. 
</P>
<P>
	During previous counts, census takers have missed significant  
numbers of people living in poor minority and immigrant 
neighborhoods. The 1990 census missed an estimated 1.4 percent of 
the population. 
</P>
<P>
	Research has shown that accuracy is increased when members of  
those communities help in counting, Miller and Meek said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under current laws, additional income earned by participants of  
various welfare programs can put them at risk of losing government 
benefits, including health care and food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller said he expects little opposition to the idea.

	Senate Nears Vote on Clinton  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With acquittal assured, the Senate talked its  
way through closed-door deliberations today at President Clinton's 
impeachment trial, set for climactic noontime votes tomorrow. More 
lawmakers came forward to announce their intentions for the roll 
calls on perjury and obstruction of justice, dividing largely along 
party lines. A formal effort to censure the president appeared all 
but dead, a victim of Republican opposition. Democrats said they 
would make an effort to force a post-trial vote on the Senate 
floor, and failing passage, would draft a statement of 
condemnation.

	N.Y. Jury Finds Gun Makers Liable  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal jury found several gun makers liable  
today in seven New York City-area shootings because of negligent 
marketing practices. Other manufacturers were cleared. Damages were 
awarded only in the case of the sole survivor of the seven 
shootings, Steven Fox, 19, who was seriously wounded. The jurors 
ordered that he be paid $3.9 million. The federal jury was 
deadlocked for days over whether negligent marketing by the 25 
defendants was a factor in seven shootings in the New York City 
area in 1993-94 -- a claim that was considered a test case for 
similar anti-gun suits filed by large cities.

	American Drops More Flights

<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- American Airlines pilots apparently ignored a  
judge's back-to-work order today, grounding nearly half the 
airline's flights -- the most since the sickout began over the 
weekend. American went to court to ask the judge to hold the pilots 
union in contempt. A hearing was scheduled for tomorrow morning. 
Passengers whose travel plans were disrupted by the dispute at the 
nation's second-largest airline fumed and fretted. Over 200,000 
travelers have been stranded across the country and 2,500 flights 
canceled since Saturday. Pilots are protesting the slow integration 
of recently purchased Reno Air into American's pay levels.

Albanian flags, 40 ethnic Albanians were buried today on a snowy 
hillside in front of 10,000 mourners, nearly a month after their 
killings. More than 2,000 people have died in a year of fighting in 
Kosovo, the southern province in Serbia. Britain's foreign 
secretary said today the Serbs were wasting time at the Kosovo

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. warplanes attacked several Iraqi air  
defense sites today after being targeted by radar or seeing Iraqi 
military planes violate ``no-fly'' zones, the Pentagon said. The 
attacks occurred in both the northern and southern no-fly zones. In 
the north, U.S. fighter jets were targeted by radar in each 
incident. In the south, Air Force and Navy fighter jets struck two 
anti-aircraft missile sites, radar and equipment after a pair of 
Iraqi MiG-23s flew into the no-fly zone. U.S. pilots returned 
safely to their bases, according to the Pentagon, which denied an 
Iraqi report that gunners hit an allied plane in the north.

<HEADLINE>  49ers' Detmer May Be Sent to Browns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- San Francisco quarterback Ty Detmer,  
who backed up Steve Young last season, could be on his way to 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	League rules prevent a trade from being formalized until Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	However, the 49ers and Browns have talked about a possible deal  
involving Detmer, who was signed by San Francisco before last 
season as a free agent after two years as a starter for 
Philadelphia. He also spent four years in Green Bay as Brett 
Favre's understudy. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland, looking to stock its new team with players, would  
give the 49ers draft picks in exchange for Detmer. Other San 
Francisco players that could be included in the swap are defensive 
end Roy Barker and tight end Irv Smith, according to unidentified 
sources cited by the Oakland Tribune and Contra Costa Times on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In his only start last season, Detmer offset three interceptions  
by throwing for three scores in San Francisco's 25-23 win over 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers are in need of draft picks after last April's trade  
with Denver in which they sent their 1999 second-round selection to 
Denver in exchange for tackle Jamie Brown, who proved to be a bust 
and was released earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco also is trying to slash its bloated player  
payroll. Teams must be in compliance with the cap by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The expansion Browns are believed to want Detmer, a seven-year  
pro, as a potential starter while a young quarterback, perhaps 
rookie Tim Couch, is groomed for the job. Cleveland is considering 
taking Couch, a star at Kentucky, with the first pick in the NFL 
draft.

<HEADLINE> Newspapers Seek More Readers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Newspaper industry groups are jointly developing  
a plan to boost readership at a time of explosive growth in media 
choices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Newspaper Association of America, the American Society of  
Newspaper Editors, the Newspaper Management Center of Northwestern 
University and the McCormick Tribune Foundation hope to have a 
five-year proposal set by May. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan would then be presented to the entire newspaper  
industry to initiate a collaborative effort to increase readership, 
the groups said in a statement Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAA reported in November that 58.6 percent of adults read a  
daily newspaper -- a figure that has remained steady over the past 
two years amid growing competition from cable news channels and the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	But overall newspaper circulation declined slightly from April  
through September last year, according to an NAA calculation of 
figures culled by the Audit Bureau of Circulations. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Senate Runs Out Impeachment Clock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Only a block away from the secret Senate  
impeachment deliberations, Sen. Jim Jeffords wore a relieved look 
as he sat alone on the dais in a virtually deserted committee room. 
</P>
<P>
	While most of his brethren were corralled in the Senate chamber  
Thursday morning, the Vermont Republican was politely questioning 
witnesses eager to discuss education policy. Two of them had 
traveled from Jeffords' home state to appear before the Senate 
Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee he chairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps too soon for Jeffords, it was suddenly time to return to  
the Senate -- but not before he had a few grateful words for his 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank you, one, for the tremendous testimony, and secondly,  
for rescuing me from the impeachment trial,'' Jeffords said with a 
grin. The heat was off for him, since he announced Wednesday that 
he would vote to acquit President Clinton on both articles of 
impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	With Clinton all but assured of keeping his job, the Senate was  
in effect simply running out the trial clock Thursday. The slow 
procession of statements by senators continued behind closed doors, 
and several more appeared before the cameras or released written 
statements announcing their votes and how they'd reached their 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Although senators are prevented by rules from discussing the  
details of closed impeachment sessions, nothing prevents them from 
giving their speeches in public as well. Senators will also have 
the option of placing statements explaining their votes in the 
official Congressional Record after the votes on the articles. 
</P>
<P>
	``You deserve an explanation of how I came to this terribly  
serious decision,'' Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., said in announcing 
that he would vote to convict Clinton only on the obstruction of 
justice article. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., told reporters after  
a lunch break there had been some ``tremendous presentations'' in 
private on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
	But the rhetoric, however high-flown, apparently wasn't engaging  
every senator. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can only absorb so much wisdom,'' said Sen. Chuck Hagel,  
R-Neb. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hasn't changed a single vote,'' observed Sen. Jay  
Rockefeller, D-W.Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, however, some senators felt compelled by the  
proceedings' historic nature to attempt to rise to the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
	To show his reverence for the Constitution's protection from  
``partisan prosecutions,'' Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., recalled in his 
floor statement how his Jewish family fled Nazi Germany. Sen. Bob 
Graham, D-Fla., discussed how the Constitution was drafted to 
prevent the ``excessive power'' wielded by English kings over the 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	Others sought a more relaxed approach: ``I write this statement  
at my desk on the floor of the United States Senate,'' Hagel began. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said many of the speeches were ``very  
personal,'' and senators of both parties appeared attentive and 
sympathetic, even if they disagreed with the speaker. 
</P>
<P>
	``I find senators go across the aisle to shake hands, even when  
they've taken a diametrically opposite position,'' Leahy said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Chief Justice William Rehnquist's demeanor was  
``remarkable ... and keeping good humor'' as he presided over the 
sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite protests from some about closing the doors, keeping the  
public out, many senators said doing it that way actually cuts down 
on the posturing and probably will help the Senate avoid the 
partisan rancor of the House impeachment debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oddly, strangely, I think we've grown closer together,'' said  
Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn. ``It's a shared experience.''

<HEADLINE> Dartmouth Students Protest Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Dartmouth College students are so furious  
at the school's push to get rid of traditional fraternities and 
sororities that they canceled the keg jump and 20 other events at 
this weekend's Winter Carnival to show how boring life on campus 
can be. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 1,000 students protested Wednesday night outside  
Dartmouth President James Wright's home, which happens to be on 
fraternity row. He did not come outside, but he did open the 
carnival on the college green Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	About 900 students were there, many wearing sweatshirts  
displaying Greek letters. Non-members wore T-shirts declaring, 
``Unaffiliated but I support the Greeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Standing in front of a 20-foot snow sculpture of a dog, Wright  
joked: ``I have not been invited to any fraternity parties this 
weekend, but I still intend to have a good time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the crowd booed.  
</P>
<P>
	Students were stunned by the school's plan, made public Tuesday,  
to do away with single-sex, residential fraternities and sororities 
to encourage ``respectful relations between women and men.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the Ivy League school, which inspired the movie  
``Animal House,'' refused to say whether the plan means requiring 
fraternities and sororities to go coed or phasing them out 
altogether. Administrators say they are seeking student 
suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coed Fraternity Sorority Council on Wednesday canceled all  
21 fraternity and sorority events, including the celebrated keg 
jump, planned to coincide with the carnival. College-sponsored 
events were to go on as planned. 
</P>
<P>
	For the keg jump, members of Psi Upsilon fraternity  
traditionally flood their front lawn to create an ice rink and hold 
a contest to see which ice skater can jump over the most beer kegs. 
The fraternity will hold a forum on Greek life instead. 
</P>
<P>
	Greek officers also canceled big parties for the rest of the  
semester. 
</P>
<P>
	About 35 percent of Dartmouth's 4,300 undergraduates are members  
of 25 single-sex fraternities and sororities. Freshmen cannot 
pledge. 
</P>
<P>
	Dartmouth is located in Hanover, a town of about 9,000 in the  
rural northern part of the state near the Vermont state line. 
</P>
<P>
	``I basically had no social life until I joined a sorority  
because there was nothing to do,'' said Catherine Curran, 19, a 
sophomore from Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even not being in the Greek system, all the parties you go to  
are in Greek houses,'' said Jane Parkin, 19, a sophomore from 
Palatine, Ill., who does not belong to a sorority. 
</P>
<P>
	Hillary Miller, 18, a freshman from New York City, and Calmita  
Fields, 21, a senior from Drexel Hill, Pa., who don't belong to 
sororities, said they liked the administration's idea because there 
would be more social events without alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	They also said they think a lot of students feel the same way.  
</P>
<P>
	``The thing that gets these people so excited is when their own  
comfortable lifestyle is threatened,'' Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	``My only regret is they didn't do this when I was a freshman,''  
Fields said.

<HEADLINE> Religion Today  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Sitting in his plush office in the coastal town  
of La Jolla, John Lynch listened to a religious broadcast over a 
speaker phone. The muffled message was the most overt sign that 
this was the corporate headquarters of Catholic Family Radio. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynch, the fledgling network's chief executive officer and a  
former Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker, has no images of the Virgin 
Mary or Jesus Christ on these walls. Instead there's a gallery of 
sports portraits that include his sons, John Jr., a Tampa Bay 
Buccaneers safety, and Ryan, a pitcher on a Baltimore Orioles 
minor-league team. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynch declines to categorize himself as liberal or conservative,  
and says: ``We're not going to try to get involved in the politics 
of the church.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But religious broadcasting has a way of creating politics, and  
some critics are already questioning the evenhandedness of the 
network's message. 
</P>
<P>
	Catholic Family Radio bought seven stations from Children's  
Broadcasting Corp. for $37 million last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The format was round-the-clock Gregorian chants until January,  
when the network started transmitting talk shows and other 
programming from Los Angeles to stations in Chicago, Philadelphia, 
Denver, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Milwaukee and Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	In the next few months, CFR hopes to add 10 stations, including  
ones in Washington, Houston, Boston and New York's Long Island, and 
reach 100 stations by next year. By then Lynch expects to dispense 
with the speaker phone, used because the signal from his nearest 
station, in Los Angeles, is not strong enough yet to reach the San 
Diego area. 
</P>
<P>
	The network began as the Catholic Radio Network, but marketing  
tests showed that the name narrowed the audience. ``There's great 
power in the name `family,''' said Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
	Half the daily broadcast is original programming.  
</P>
<P>
	Dan Lungren, a former California attorney general who lost a bid  
for governor last fall, is a daily talk show host, chatting with 
callers about everything from liberation theology and separation of 
church and state to drug abuse and children's access to the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The network hopes to have nonstop original programming by the  
end of February and daily commentaries by well-known Catholics such 
as Don Shula and Bobby Ross, NFL friends who accepted Lynch's 
invitation to voice their opinions on the airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
	However, some are concerned that the network's founders and  
investors -- including the Rev. Joseph Fessio, editor of Ignatius 
Press in San Francisco; mutual fund guru Peter Lynch, no relation 
to John; and Domino's Pizza founder Tom Monaghan -- are 
fundamentalists interested in bringing that Catholic view to 
listeners. 
</P>
<P>
	``I find some of the people involved, especially Father Fessio,  
have been very divisive, and I just don't think we need that,'' 
said Milwaukee Archbishop Rembert G. Weakland, an influential, 
liberal Catholic who believes the network is more about stirring 
controversy than seeking truth. 
</P>
<P>
	But Fessio defended his idea for a 24-hour Catholic network.  
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, the key here is that the catechism of the Catholic  
Church is our norm,'' Fessio said. ``That should unite all 
Catholics, whether they are liberal, conservative or in between.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lynch, who had retired to San Diego and agreed to use his former  
investment business office as the network's headquarters, said his 
goal was to give Catholics and non-Catholics tools for bringing 
their families closer. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're trying to do is not preach, not to be fire and  
brimstone. We're out there talking about everyday problems and 
challenges,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Catholics need to get their message out to the growing number of  
people seeking guidance, Lynch said. Of the 1,600 religious radio 
stations broadcasting in the United States, none is Catholic, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The network was inspired partly by a 1996 message from Pope John  
Paul II, who said that the Catholic Church had done a poor job of 
using mass media to evangelize, Lynch said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the pope's recent visit to St. Louis, network  
representatives met with officials of the Vatican Radio, which 
broadcasts messages from the pope to stations internationally, and 
they agreed to provide some programming, Lynch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Karl Stoll, spokesman for the National Religious Broadcasters,  
an Evangelical Protestant organization based in Manassas, Va., said 
the network will probably do well, considering the recent trend in 
religious broadcasting. There were 28 more radio stations 
broadcasting religious programming in 1998 than in 1997, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see this as a spiritual hunger that's occurring,'' Stoll  
said. ``People are looking for answers.''

	MIAMI (AP) -- The FBI is investigating a possible death threat  
against Gloria Estefan, the singer's company told a television

WSVN-TV for a story Thursday. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> 90-Year-Old Woman Survives in Snow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKES, N.D. (AP) -- When David Fiala discovered the 90-year-old  
woman collapsed on the snowbound gravel road, she was so cold he 
could barely squeeze her into his truck. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her one glove was just frozen solid, and her pantlegs were  
frozen solid,'' he recalled Wednesday. ``Her legs wouldn't bend. I 
had a hard time getting her in the pickup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Margaret Hansen still can't believe she survived to describe the  
ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suppose if I read the story, I'd say, `That can't be  
true,''' she said from her hospital bed. ``I didn't think I was 
going to make it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hansen had left her Forman home in southeastern North Dakota on  
Jan. 23 to make a morning hair appointment. Her car got stuck in a 
snowdrift, and she worried no one would find her. She started 
walking. 
</P>
<P>
	``I walked the first mile and a half, and then my legs got numb,  
and then I started crawling,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, she couldn't crawl any more.  
</P>
<P>
	By the time Fiala found her in the early evening, she was barely  
conscious. 
</P>
<P>
	``I touched her and she responded very little,'' Fiala said. ``I  
tried asking her how she got out there, because there was no 
vehicle around. She mumbled something about `lost her way.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The two went in Fiala's truck to a neighboring farm and waited  
for an ambulance that took her to Oakes Community Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was in pretty bad shape at the time she came,'' said Dr.  
Veer Rao. ``She was just barely opening her eyes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rao said her body temperature had sunk to 80 degrees on a day  
that the National Weather Service said never warmed above 28. 
</P>
<P>
	Hansen, who usually walks with the help of a cane, now has  
braces on both her legs and is using a walker. Rao said he expects 
her to be hospitalized for a couple more weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hansen, however, is already making plans.  
</P>
<P>
	``I still haven't got my hair done,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Hires Romney As Boss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- With a new boss and an organizational  
shakeup, Salt Lake Olympic officials vowed Thursday to put the 
bribery scandal behind them and focus on ``athletes and altruism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mitt Romney, a venture capitalist who turns around troubled  
companies, was hired to do the same for the 2002 Winter Games, 
which have been paralyzed by ethical misconduct that has scared 
sponsors and shaken the Olympic movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``These games and the preparations leading up to the games will  
comply with the highest level of ethical conduct,'' Romney vowed. 
``There is absolutely no excuse for the compromise of principles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake Organizing Committee also revamped its leadership,  
pledged to open up its meetings and records, and accepted the 
resignations of three key members -- two of whom had perceived 
conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney's selection will help move the Olympics' focus from  
``money and materialism back to its roots of athletes and 
altruism,'' Gov. Mike Leavitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney, whose ancestors were Mormon pioneers, was the clear  
choice of Leavitt and SLOC Chairman Robert Garff. 
</P>
<P>
	Executives of Salt Lake's bid committee have been blamed for  
giving more than $1 million in cash payments, bogus scholarships, 
shopping sprees, vacations and free medical care to 24 
International Olympic Committee members in exchange for getting the 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, four IOC members have resigned and another five have  
been expelled. 
</P>
<P>
	New evidence against one of those 24 -- Kim Un-yong -- will be  
reviewed by an IOC panel, said Richard Pound, the lead investigator 
for the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, one of the most powerful IOC members, will have a chance to  
explain details of Salt Lake's ethics report tied his son to a 
$75,000 telecommunications job directly funded by Salt Lake Olympic 
bid executives. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim already was under investigation by the IOC because the bid  
committee allegedly helped him secure a U.S. visa for a Russian 
student and may have helped his daughter land a piano recitals with 
the Salt Lake Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, IOC member Jim Easton said his company, at the  
request of the Salt Lake bid committee, hired the son of IOC member 
David Sibandze of Swaziland, who resigned last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were doing a favor for the bid committee. In hindsight I  
wouldn't do it,'' said Easton, one of the United States' two IOC 
members. ``At the time it seemed perfectly acceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Easton, who also serves on the SLOC, said he did not consider it  
unethical because Sibo Sibandze actually worked and Easton Aluminum 
paid his $9 per hour wages for errands, research and office help in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound, who met Thursday with sponsors in New York, said there  
was no indication corporations were considering pulling out. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sponsor group has been very good, proper and  
businesslike,'' he said. ``They say, `We understand you have 
problems, we appreciate what you are doing to clean up and we are 
supportive of your efforts to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romney said he has little doubt corporate sponsors now wary of  
supporting the Olympics will jump at the chance to sponsor the 
first United States Winter Games in nearly two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll bet you see John Hancock and others like them standing in  
line to support the Salt Lake Olympics,'' Romney said, referring to 
comments Tuesday by the president of the insurance company. David 
D'Alessandro said he was protesting the IOC's failure to deal with 
the corruption scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Rob Baskin, a spokesman for Coca-Cola, said Thursday his  
company's ``commitment to the Olympic Games and Olympic athletes 
has not flagged. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do, however,'' Baskin continued, ``want to be certain that  
the current scandals being investigated are resolved and processes 
put in place to insure that they won't happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selling the 2002 Winter Games to corporate sponsors will be a  
big part of Romney's focus. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides unanimously approving Romney as its new chief executive  
and president, the committee endorsed sweeping plans for higher 
ethical standards and openness.	   Acting on proposals by Leavitt and Garff, SLOC approved 
expanding its board of trustees from 33 to 50 and stripping it of 
its decision-making authority, making it an advisory board to a new 
management committee of 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt gave any SLOC member with a perceived conflict of  
interest 60 days to resign. Two SLOC trustees directly affected -- 
Earl Holding and Alan Layton -- immediately quit. 
</P>
<P>
	Layton's construction company won a $29 million contract to  
enclose the speedskating oval. Holding owns Snowbasin Ski Area, 
which will get $13.8 million from SLOC as the downhill and super-G 
venue, and Little America Grand, a hotel that is expected to be the 
IOC's home during the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Also resigning was Verl Topham, president of Utah Power, saying  
he was doing so for the good of the games. Topham was among the 
SLOC members who also served on the bid committee board, which was 
criticized in an ethics report Tuesday for failing to oversee 
zealous executives. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt said that while none of those resigning did anything  
wrong, ``it is clear to all of us we need to move any impediment to 
the games out of the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romney, owner of Bain Capital Inc. in Boston, was portrayed as  
just the leader Salt Lake needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds to me like a great choice,'' Pound said.  
</P>
<P>
	Easton said Romney ``has the charisma and experience to carry  
this forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romney said he doesn't believe the Olympic movement will be  
permanently stained by the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The managers have messed up big time. The athletes haven't,''  
he said. ``Our job is to go to work for the athletes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romney pledged to spend no more money than the games take in, to  
spare taxpayers, to protect the environment and to take no salary 
until the Olympics are over and in the black. 
</P>
<P>
	When he is paid, it will be $285,000 per year -- the same rate as  
his predecessor, Frank Joklik, who resigned Jan. 8. Joklik claimed 
to know nothing about the excesses of bid executives while he 
served as chairman of the committee. He will remain on SLOC's board 
of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney will have to sever ties with any companies that do  
business with the games. Bain Capital has ownership stakes in many 
companies and Romney serves on various boards of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	A Republican, Romney unsuccessfully challenged Sen. Ted Kennedy  
in 1994 and is the son of the late Michigan Gov. George Romney. He 
dismissed suggestions that he wants to create a new political base 
in Utah for a future run at the Senate. He and his wife, Ann, live 
in Belmont, Mass., and have a second home near Park City, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney graduated from Mormon church-owned Brigham Young and has  
been a Mormon bishop (lay leader of a congregation) and stake 
president (leader of a group of congregations) in Massachusetts.

<HEADLINE> Browns Ready To Grab Free Agents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A lot of NFL teams got very jumpy when they saw the Cleveland  
Browns take low-priced player after low-priced player in the 
expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The draft left Cleveland with nearly $40 million to spend on  
free agents, allowing the Browns to outbid any team they want for 
top players in the free-agent period that begins today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking to bring aboard any significant player who can  
have a major impact on the team,'' Carmen Policy, the new team's 
president, said. ``Neither cap space nor cash should be an 
impediment to our going forward in free agency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's a new feeling for Policy, who was always over the cap  
when he ran the San Francisco 49ers. And look for 49ers to be 
targets, particularly young wide receivers Terrell Owens and J.J. 
Stokes. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens is a restricted free agent, meaning San Francisco can  
retain him by matching any offer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Niners entered the free-agent period close to $20 million  
over the $57.3 million cap, a $70 million differential from the 
Browns that makes it almost impossible for them to match a 
Cleveland offer. 
</P>
<P>
	The other 30 teams, of course, have one advantage -- established  
rosters -- and most of them want to re-sign their own players rather 
than go after unknowns in the free-agent pool. 
</P>
<P>
	The best example of that is Minnesota, which finished 15-1 last  
season after re-signing four key players -- defensive tackle John 
Randle, offensive tackle Todd Steussie, wide receiver Jake Reed and 
running back Robert Smith. But that set them back $93 million, 
which presents a problem this season, with eight key players 
becoming unrestricted free agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, they've already resigned quarterback Randall Cunningham  
and offensive tackle Korey Stringer, and chances are they'll keep 
most or at least the best, like Pro Bowl linebacker Ed McDaniel, 
strong safety Robert Griffith and defensive end Derrick Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the way you like to do it, particularly when you can  
keep people of that quality,'' Buffalo general manager John Butler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know what your own players can do -- on and off the field.  
You're never sure when you bring in new people. But that doesn't 
mean you won't look to plug holes or be forced to let people go 
because of the cap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, teams are looking to rid themselves of players whose  
salaries exceed their value. This year's salary cap is just short 
of $57.3 million, $5 million more than last year. But even if they 
do, there are not a lot of prime unrestricted players out there, 
and few teams that have money to outbid Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	The deepest position in free agency is wide receiver, headed by  
All-Pro Antonio Freeman of Green Bay, who is likely to be given a 
franchise player tag to protect him. Cincinnati did the same this 
week with Carl Pickens, whom they may trade for the two first-round 
draft picks that come with that tag. Arizona might do the same with 
Rob Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	Others receivers available include Stokes, Sean Dawkins of New  
Orleans, Charles Johnson of Pittsburgh and Leslie Shepherd of 
Washington, all unrestricted, unlike Owens. 
</P>
<P>
	The success of the Vikings contrasts with the way other teams  
have thrown money around with little result. For example, Seattle 
spent millions on big-name free agents for the second straight 
year, but finished 8-8, costing coach Dennis Erickson his job. One 
problem: the revolving door game in which the Seahawks lost center 
Kevin Mawae, who went to the New York Jets and became the hub of 
their vastly improved offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year teams that were close to the Super Bowl got  
extremely aggressive in free agency, and that got the coach 
fired,'' said Miami coach Jimmy Johnson. ``Look at Carolina and 
Kansas City and Seattle. They wreck their salary cap, which costs 
them for years to come. The longer free agency goes on, the more 
that teams are disappointed with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's what makes free agency risky.  
</P>
<P>
	Many players are improved by the players around them, like wide  
Alvin Harper, a standout in Dallas playing opposite Michael Irvin. 
He did nothing after signing in 1995 with Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's example of that could be the Giants' Chad Bratzke, a  
good but not great defensive end, to whom the Browns are said to be 
ready to offer $5 million a year. He had 11 1/2 sacks, but they came 
in part because All-Pro Michael Strahan played the other end, and 
he could slide without help from skilled linemates. 
</P>
<P>
	What the Vikings do might turn on what happens with Brad  
Johnson, who began last season as the starting quarterback, got 
hurt twice and never got his job back from Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, due a $1.15 million bonus March 1, might be traded to  
Baltimore, coached by former Minnesota offensive coordinator Brian 
Billick. He's by far the most attractive quarterback available in a 
market that includes Kerry Collins and veteran backups like Rich 
Gannon of Kansas City and Steve Bono of St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	That would provide cap room to sign those Vikings who might  
leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``Management will do an excellent job,'' Cunningham said. ``They  
did an excellent job getting guys signed last year, and they'll do 
it again this year, I'm sure.''

<HEADLINE> GM Exec: High Demand May Hurt GM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- If U.S. demand for new cars and trucks remains as  
strong this year as it was in December and January, there's ``not a 
chance'' General Motors Corp. will meet its goal of gaining 32 
percent of the domestic market, GM's North American president said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	While higher demand would normally mean more sales for an  
automaker, GM already is stretched thin on its most popular and 
profitable products: pickups and sport utility vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Production capacity is not the problem, Ronald Zarrella told  
reporters during the Chicago Auto Show media preview: Quite simply, 
GM cannot get enough V-8 engines to meet the robust demand. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's market share last year fell below 30 percent, in part  
because of United Auto Workers' strikes that halted production for 
several weeks last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	It introduced its long-awaited new pickups last fall, but  
inventories still remain far too low. So even if industry sales 
rise, GM can't make any more of its trucks to meet the increased 
demand and those sales will go to other automakers, further 
diluting GM's share. 
</P>
<P>
	Zarrella said GM has an inventory of about 30 days for its  
full-sized pickups; 60 is considered normal. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand in the past two months has been unusually strong, at an  
average annual rate of 16 million units. Americans bought about 
15.6 million vehicles last year. GM's official forecast is for 15 
million to 15.5 million vehicles to be sold in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chevrolet division, meanwhile, is betting demand for the  
2000 Monte Carlo coupe will be higher after it goes on sale next 
fall, despite a declining market for two-door cars. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's volume division unveiled the mid-size car Thursday, a month  
after it displayed the car's sedan version, the 2000 Impala, which 
also goes on sale later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Coupe sales have been down sharply this decade as buyers have  
bought the sport utility vehicles and sedans. In the past few 
years, Ford Motor Co. has stopped producing the Thunderbird and 
Probe coupes. 
</P>
<P>
	But GM executives said they are sticking with the market. Chevy  
expects to sell 70,000 to 80,000 Monte Carlos a year, up from about 
65,000 last year. That compares with plans to sell about 200,000 
Impalas. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's still a couple buyers out there who want an exciting  
brand,'' Chevrolet general manager Kurt Ritter said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new version borrows styling cues from the original Monte  
Carlo of the 1970s, including a long hood, blunt rear end, vertical 
taillight and a return of the ``knight'' emblem. 
</P>
<P>
	But the overall look is less angular and a departure from the  
current Lumina-based Monte Carlo. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevrolet will target the Monte Carlo to drivers in their  
mid-30s and mid-40s. 
</P>
<P>
	The Monte Carlo and Impala also share their chassis and major  
mechanical parts with the Pontiac Grand Prix, Oldsmobile Intrigue 
and Buick Century and Regal. 
</P>
<P>
	Cars will be built at GM's Oshawa, Ontario, plant.  
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Auto Show opens to the public Friday and runs  
through Feb. 21.

<HEADLINE> AP Corrects Viagra-Sex Headline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Associated Press reportedly erroneously in a  
headline for online services Wednesday that the American Medical 
Association had said that the makers of Viagra had paid for a 
recent sex study. 
</P>
<P>
	The authors were actually paid by Pfizer Inc. to review clinical  
trial data on Viagra before the impotency drug was submitted for 
government approval. That work had nothing to do with the study 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
	The AMA revealed that it had not noted the payment to the  
authors by Pfizer in its story on the study Wednesday.

<HEADLINE>  Weiss Leads After Short Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Maybe Michael Weiss is better off chasing  
No. 1 than being in the top spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Skating as the favorite for the first time, Weiss turned in a  
less-than-perfect and somewhat lackluster short program Thursday 
night at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships. He was still first 
with all nine judges, but that was more out of reputation than 
repertoire. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy Goebel, the first American man to land the quadruple  
jump in competition, was second in the short program, worth 
one-third of the total score. Trifun Zivanovic was third. 
</P>
<P>
	The men's free skate is Saturday afternoon.  
</P>
<P>
	Weiss finished second to five-time U.S. champion Todd Eldredge  
the past two years and is the overwhelming favorite to win his 
first title this week. Though Eldredge kept his eligibility -- 
allowing him to compete at nationals, the Olympics and the world 
championships -- he's only competing in a select few pro-ams and 
isn't defending his title. 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing a psychedelic-looking gold, orange and brown lion-print  
T-shirt and charcoal leather pants, Weiss looked like the same old 
rebel with an attitude who enjoyed shaking up the staid world of 
figure skating. But when the music started, it was Weiss who looked 
dull. 
</P>
<P>
	His opening triple axel was out of whack, tilting like the  
Leaning Tower of Pisa, though he managed to save the landing. He 
lost his footing on his circular footwork and got off-balance, and 
he couldn't recover in time to complete it. Though his triple 
flip-triple toe loop combination was solid, it won't be enough to 
compete with the Russians at the world championships next month. 
</P>
<P>
	But Weiss showed some flashes of his old self, punctuating the  
guitar riffs with little hops and playing to the audience like he 
was skating in a show. As he slid to center ice to finish the 
program, he pumped his fist and mouthed the word ``Yow'' -- right in 
time with Van Halen's lead singer. 
</P>
<P>
	Goebel, who withdrew after the short program last year because  
of a lingering hip injury, was solid, but he's still lacking the 
flair he needs to win. Skating to ``Zorba,'' he at times seemed to 
be going through the motions instead of having a rousing time at a 
Greek wedding. 
</P>
<P>
	He seemed to get a little more enthused with his footwork,  
flying across the ice as the music got faster and the audience 
started clapping. And technically, he was fine. He was a little 
shaky on the landing of his triple axel, but he saved it, and his 
triple flip-triple toe loop combination was huge. 
</P>
<P>
	He ended with a flourish, sliding across the ice on one knee and  
pumping his fist as the music ended. He was so excited he almost 
missed a Beanie Baby that a fan threw on the ice, needing a fancy 
step to avoid skating over the doll.

<HEADLINE> Cargo Ship Still Stuck Off Oregon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOS BAY, Ore. (AP) -- Foiled in their first attempt, demolitions  
experts came back with plastic explosives and napalm today in an 
attempt to ignite the fuel in a mired cargo ship and save beaches 
from a disastrous spill. 
</P>
<P>
	Navy bomb experts boarded the 639-foot New Carissa with  
explosive charges that they hope will be able to crack open the 
ship's fuel tanks and allow the tarlike bunker oil to fill up the 
cargo holds. They then will put eight barrels of the highly 
flammable napalm gel over the oil, leave the ship and ignite it by 
remote control with C-4 plastic explosives. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be like your barbecue pit, if you will,'' said  
Coast Guard Chief Gene Maestas. ``They are going to put lighter 
fluid on the coals and light it on fire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giving authorities this second chance is a more promising  
weather forecast. A storm that had threatened to break up the ship 
with 70 mph winds has slowed and weakened, now expected to arrive 
this afternoon with top winds of no more than 40 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our window of opportunity has widened,'' Maestas said, adding  
that the crews working under rainless, slate-gray skies would need 
at least four hours to set up for the second burning attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	The ship, owned by a Japanese company and registered in Panama  
with a crew of 23 Filipinos, ran aground Feb. 4 about 150 yards 
offshore. It was laying off the mouth of Coos Bay waiting for 
stormy weather to break so it could pick up a load of wood chips. 
</P>
<P>
	Pounding surf opened up cracks in its hull Monday, unleashing  
the brownish-black goo into the churning surf and onto several 
miles of beaches. Three of the ship's five fuel tanks had ruptured. 
If all five tanks rupture, the spill could total 400,000 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities at first hoped to get tugboats to pull the ship  
free, but the approaching storm raised fears that more oil would 
leak from the ship, so they opted for the plan to burn up the fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	The first try Wednesday night using grenades and buckets of  
gasoline flamed out quickly. After a brief flash and a plume of 
oily black smoke, a smoldering glow in two of the ship's cargo 
holds was all there was to show for eight hours of preparation. 
</P>
<P>
	While the grenades all detonated properly, they failed to  
penetrate the half- to three-quarter-inch steel plated fuel tanks, 
said U.S. Navy Lt. Scot Wilson, of the Explosive Ordnance Disposal 
Unit on Whidbey Island, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	Darkness finally forced demolition experts to call off the  
attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're between a rock and a hard spot,'' said Coast Guard Capt.  
Mike Hall. ``If we don't do something now we would have to stand 
before you and tell you why we let 400,000 gallons of oil spill on 
our beaches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A controlled burn could take as long as three days, after which  
the charred hull would be cut up and hauled away. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal is to keep the fuel within the skin of the ship,''  
said Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	About 300 people were mobilized to scrape up the gelatinous  
residue that has washed ashore. Oil booms were placed near the 
spill to protect sensitive environmental areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Several birds have been found coated with fuel. Crews equipped  
to deal with oiled wildlife were standing by in case the slick 
moves into the nearby habitat of the Western snowy plover, a 
threatened shore bird.

<HEADLINE> More Anti-Tobacco Verdicts Forseen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- California may provide fertile ground for  
more tobacco liability suits, analysts said after jurors here 
punished Philip Morris with a record $51.5 million damage award for 
deceiving a sick smoker. 
</P>
<P>
	The jurors -- including three smokers -- went out of their way  
during deliberations to make the company suffer for concealing what 
it knew about the links between cigarettes and cancer, foreman 
George Loudis said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``One woman said she contemplated $1 billion. I told them this  
wasn't the real world,'' said Loudis, noting that the plaintiff had 
only asked for $15 million. ``I mean the numbers just flowed out of 
their mouths.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jurors were clearly acting out of ``passion and prejudice,''  
said Bill Ohlemeyer, an attorney for Philip Morris Cos. He 
predicted that the award would be overturned on appeal, like 
several verdicts recently in other states. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the size of the award to Patricia Henley, a former  
three-pack-a-day smoker with inoperable lung cancer, analysts 
predicted a wave of lawsuits and ever-higher penalties will follow. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the dam is cracking,'' said Dr. Stanton Glantz, a  
medical professor at the University of California, San Francisco, 
whose 1996 book, ``Cigarette Papers,'' uncovered tobacco industry 
documents many lawyers have used in their cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The award -- $50 million in punitive damages and $1.5 million for  
Ms. Henley's pain and suffering -- is the first in California since 
the state repealed a 1987 law that banned smokers' lawsuits. The 
ban, which was based on the idea that risks of smoking were well 
known, ended dozens of lawsuits at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	The landscape has since changed drastically. Lawyers in the more  
than 850 pending lawsuits against tobacco companies have warehouses 
full of incriminating industry documents at their disposal, thanks 
to the state attorneys general who have obtained $246 billion in 
settlements from cigarette makers over the costs of treating 
smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	Californians are particularly aware of tobacco litigation after  
a decade of antismoking ads paid for with a 25-cent-a-pack hike in 
the cigarette tax. The billboard and television campaign has 
featured a woman who smokes through a hole in her throat after 
losing her larynx to cancer, and more recently, men whose 
cigarettes fall limp, suggesting a link between smoking and 
impotence. 
</P>
<P>
	Smokers have a particularly hard time in San Francisco, where  
juice bars are popular and police have begun ticketing people who 
light up in bars. 
</P>
<P>
	``The truth is out there now,'' Glantz said. ``The sheer  
magnitude of all the lying by the industry, all the covering up by 
the tobacco companies, has just permeated society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, all this doesn't necessarily translate into a greater  
possibility of success in the city's courtrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a place where people are more geared to health, but  
the flipside is that everyone here now knows how dangerous smoking 
is,'' noted Ms. Henley's attorney, Madelyn Chaber. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco companies consider that a key defense -- that given  
decades of warnings about smoking, smokers alone are responsible 
for their health problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the irony of this jury's verdict,'' Ohlemeyer said.  
``California, even before other states and the federal government, 
back in the 1950s, had antismoking programs. It's hard to believe 
that ordinary people weren't aware of the risks of smoking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Henley, who sued in San Francisco because she smoked her  
first cigarette at a high school dance there at the age of 15, quit 
smoking just two years ago at 50 after she was diagnosed with 
tobacco-related small-cell carcinoma. 
</P>
<P>
	``Philip Morris says over and over, 'Well, you saw the  
warnings,' and they're right,'' Ms. Henley acknowledged Thursday. 
But she says she never understood how dangerous cigarettes were 
until a friend brought her a newspaper article listing the 
potential carcinogens that appear in cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're putting so much stuff in it that it has become a  
lethal poison,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chemotherapy and radiation put her cancer in remission, but  
forced her to give up her drain-cleaning business, so she's been 
out of work since April, getting by in the Southern California town 
of Eagle Rock on a monthly $487 disability check. 
</P>
<P>
	Only three other times have juries awarded smokers damages in  
health claims against tobacco companies, and all of them have been 
overturned on appeal. The largest previous award was $1 million 
awarded to the family of Roland Maddox, who died in 1997 of lung 
cancer after smoking for 50 years. A Florida appeals court threw 
out that verdict earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	But if Ms. Henley's award stands up, she wants none of the  
punitive damages for herself. Instead, she plans to use it ``to 
spearhead something here in California that will educate children 
about the dangers of smoking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This was never going to be about the money,'' she said.  
``There's something wrong about taking money that was made by 
killing people.''

<HEADLINE> Retail Sales Gain in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Post-holiday discounts drew Americans to  
department stores and clothing shops in January, helping to produce 
a modest 0.2 gain in retail sales after a big increase the month 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase reported today by the Commerce Department, to a  
seasonally adjusted $232 billion, was in line with economists' 
expectations. It followed a large 1 percent gain in December and 
dovetailed with their belief that robust economic growth at the end 
of 1998 is carrying over into early 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Conditions remain bright for continued strong sales.  
Unemployment held at a 29-year low of 4.3 percent in January. 
Interest rates remain low, stock prices high and inflation 
contained. 
</P>
<P>
	In a sign the supply of jobs remains plentiful, the Labor  
Department said the number of Americans filing first-time claims 
for unemployment checks dropped by 13,000 last week to a seasonally 
adjusted 281,000, the lowest level since July 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	A four-week moving average of claims, which smoothes  
fluctuations in the volatile data, fell by 19,750 to a four-month 
low of 297,750. 
</P>
<P>
	While the overall increase in sales was relatively muted, sales  
at department stores and other general merchandisers soared 1.5 
percent, the biggest increase in 11 months. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report earlier this month, big discount chains  
such as Wal-Mart, Target and Kmart recorded the strongest gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Clothing, shoe and accessory shops reported a 1 percent increase  
in January, and drug stores, an 0.8 percent advance. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, auto sales rose 0.2 percent on top of a big 2.2  
percent jump in January. Receipts at building-supply and garden 
centers were unchanged after a healthy 1.9 percent gain in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	Furniture sales fell 0.4 percent, the worst performance in nine  
months. They were strong through much of 1998, helped by spillover 
from record home sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales also fell at food stores, 0.5 percent; gas stations, 0.5  
percent, reflecting the lowest gasoline prices in more than a 
decade; and restaurants and bars, 0.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> Garth Brooks Going to Padres' Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Garth Brooks is trading his cowboy hat for a  
baseball cap and subbing Grammy hopes for World Series dreams. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Diego Padres and Garth Brooks have scheduled a  
conference call Friday to announce that the country music superstar 
will go to spring training with the big league club, sources told 
The Associated Press late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Padres spokesmen refused comment, but owner John Moores said it  
was no secret that Brooks longed to play professional baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had indicated through channels that he was interested in  
going to spring training,'' Moores said. ``I know there have been 
some discussions underway. If he shows up, that would be dynamite. 
I think that would add a dimension to the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Where the spring training invitation leads is anyone's guess. If  
Brooks is a bust, he certainly won't have to go hunting for another 
job. He's sold almost as many albums as Elvis and the Beatles, and 
makes millions selling out concert dates across the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	But he has taken the year off from touring. If he shows he can  
play, he likely would be sent to a minor-league club to live out 
his dream. 
</P>
<P>
	Several recent developments pointed to Brooks' involvement in  
baseball. He and several baseball stars, including some Padres 
players, recently announced formation of a foundation tied to 
baseball that would benefit children's charities. 
</P>
<P>
	There was talk that Brooks would make a cameo appearance with  
the Padres at spring training like he did last year, and one of the 
Padres' vice presidents is now head of the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I ever heard was that he wanted to play baseball,'' Moores  
said. ``I understand he routinely takes batting practice at home. 
He's got an athletic build and a big pair of wheels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe he can make it work -- he obviously knows the Michael  
Jordan story. Obviously, it would be very hard. If Garth makes it, 
I'll try to do it myself. I'm sure he knows this is a tough row to 
hoe. Everybody's got to follow their dreams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan tried baseball after his first retirement from the  
Chicago Bulls, but struggled as a member of the Birmingham Barons 
and went back to basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks spent two days working out with the Padres last spring,  
and even got into a game as a pinch runner. He was almost picked 
off twice, diving back into the bag once. He even hugged the umpire 
after he was called safe. Finally, he was thrown out in a double 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was nicely received by the ballclub,'' Moores said. ``The  
players liked the hell out of him.''

</P>
<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Ducote ``Duke'' Andrepont, one of the  
founders of the Daily World in Opelousas in 1939, died Wednesday. 
He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	The Daily World was the first daily newspaper in the nation to  
use offset, and a copy of the first edition of the paper is in the 
Smithsonian Institute in Washington, D.C. Today, most newspapers 
use the offset method. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrepont was also retired editor and publisher of the Louisiana  
Peace Officers Association magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife Florence; a son, two sisters and a

 *Leonard Arrington    	
</P>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Leonard Arrington, one of the foremost  
historians of Mormonism and the mentor of a generation of Mormon 
scholars, died Thursday of congestive heart failure. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Arrington, who served for a decade as historian for The Church  
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, was the author of 21 books, 
including ``Great Basin Kingdom: An Economic History of the 
Latter-day Saints'' and ``Brigham Young: American Moses.'' He also 
coauthored ``The Mormon Experience: A History of the Latter-day 
Saints.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Named church historian in 1972 by President Joseph Fielding  
Smith, Arrington was the first professional historian to hold the 
post. He oversaw a period of several years in the 1970s when the 
church's voluminous archives were opened to many historians, both 
Mormon and non-Mormon. 
</P>
<P>
	That access was slowly closed off by church leaders beginning in  
the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Arrington, released as church historian in 1982, authored some  
200 articles on a variety of historical topics. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a professor of economics at Utah State University from  
1946 to 1972.

	Cotter was retired as curator emeritus of the University of  
Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, but continued 
to work there until last month. 
</P>
<P>
	He headed a team in the 1930s from the Academy of Natural  
Sciences in Philadelphia that uncovered weapons and tools in New 
Mexico that were used 11,000 years ago by the earliest humans known 
to have lived in North America. He wrote three books on the 
earliest days of Philadelphia and Jamestown, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1940, he joined the National Park Service as archaeologist in  
charge of a prehistoric pueblo preserved as a national monument in 
Arizona. He spent 37 years with the agency.

<HEADLINE> Reno: No Comment on Starr </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno, without  
commenting directly on reports that her department is probing 
possible prosecutorial missteps by Independent Counsel Kenneth 
Starr, pledged today there would be no interference with his 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	At her weekly news conference, Reno repeatedly parried questions  
about news reports saying the Justice Department would investigate 
whether Starr overstepped his boundaries in the early days of the 
Monica Lewinsky investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I have said all along, I try not to comment with respect to  
the independent counsel's function,'' Reno told reporters. ``I 
will, however, continue to look to see how I may comment in a way 
that is fair to all concerned, consistent with the law and 
consistent with ethical considerations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno seemed somewhat frustrated that she could not go further.  
</P>
<P>
	``If I can determine a way to properly make a comment concerning  
this matter that would be fair to all concerned and would adhere to 
the law, I will do so,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the attorney general did say no one would impede Starr's  
continuing work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have tried my level best to do this the right way, to ensure  
that there was no effort whatsoever to interfere with his 
investigation,'' she said, ``and I am convinced that nothing has 
been done, but I will continue to work to ensure that result.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the law establishing independent counsels for some  
political cases, the attorney general cannot take any disciplinary 
action against the prosecutor short of firing. Reno has stated that 
she would not undertake an investigation of an independent counsel 
unless the charges were severe enough to merit firing. 
</P>
<P>
	Several news organizations, including The Associated Press,  
reported this week that the Justice Department has advised Starr it 
intends to investigate the actions of his office, including the 
Jan. 16, 1998, offer to Ms. Lewinsky of an immunity deal 
conditioned on her not discussing it with her lawyer, Frank Carter.

<HEADLINE> Mortgage Rates Up Slightly / National Mortgage Survey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The average interest rate on 30-year  
fixed-rate mortgages rose to 6.77 percent this week, up from of 
6.75 percent last week, Freddie Mac, the mortgage company, reported 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The average has remained below 7 percent for more than seven  
months. It reached a 31-year low of 6.49 percent in early October. 
Its peak last year was 7.22 percent in late April. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing,  
averaged 6.40 percent this week, up from 6.38 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an  
average initial rate of 5.58 percent, down from 5.63 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The rates do not include add-on fees known as points, which  
averaged 1 percent of the loan amount for all three types of 
mortgages.

<HEADLINE>  Knicks Face Wizards Without Spree </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Now that they've lost Latrell Sprewell, the new  
Knicks will start looking more like the old Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Kurt Thomas and Marcus Camby will fill the role formerly  
occupied by Charles Oakley, and Dennis Scott will do his best to be 
a latter-day John Starks, or Chris Mills. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the bad thing about this, we traded two guys who came  
off the bench last year who were pretty good shooters and 
scorers,'' Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy said Wednesday as his team 
prepared to play the Washington Wizards. ``Our strength is going to 
have to be things that can be consistent every night -- defense and 
rebounding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Off to an 0-2 start when Sprewell was healthy, New York now must  
get through the next 3-6 weeks without him. 
</P>
<P>
	That should mean more of the old style offense -- dumping the  
ball inside to Patrick Ewing or Larry Johnson and letting Allan 
Houston score from the perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, a power forward, replaced Sprewell in the starting  
lineup against the Wizards, and Larry Johnson moved from power 
forward to small forward -- the spot Sprewell was playing. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell, who has a slight stress fracture of the right heel,  
will rest the injury for three weeks before it is reevaluated. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my first injury ever,'' Sprewell said, adding that it  
wouldn't have kept him from playing if this was playoff time. 
``With the way the fans have accepted me, I almost feel I'm letting 
them down, so it's more disappointing than frustrating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, signed as a free agent during training camp, has been  
ahead of Camby on the depth chart since the day he arrived. Not as 
good of a jump shooter or foul shooter as Oakley, Thomas 
nonetheless should be able to provide the rebounding Oakley 
contributed before he was traded last summer for Camby. 
</P>
<P>
	Camby's work ethic and conditioning were criticized during  
training camp by his teammates and coach, and he played only six 
minutes in New York's first two games and did not score. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not a big, strong physical type of defensive team,'' Van  
Gundy said, ``but you can still be a good defensive team without as 
many physical players if you still have a presence in the lane. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why I've been a little disappointed that we haven't  
made it known that the lane is ours,'' Van Gundy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott, who reported to camp somewhat out of shape, played seven  
minutes in New York's season-opener and did not score. He and Chris 
Childs will now be counted on to be the Knicks' primary scorers off 
the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully I can come off the bench and start popping shots  
(like Starks) and the crowd will fall in love with me,'' Scott 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	After playing Thursday at Chicago, the Knicks will be off until  
Monday.

<HEADLINE> Italian News Agency Ansa Is Struck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Journalists at the Italian news agency ANSA stayed  
off the job Thursday in the first of 12 days of sporadic strikes to 
protest the company's plans to reduce staff. 
</P>
<P>
	ANSA, the country's main news agency, wants to cut more than 40  
journalists, granting early retirement to some and laying off 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	A council of ANSA journalists issued a statement late Wednesday  
criticizing as ``unacceptable'' the company's decision to cut 
approximately 10 percent of the journalist staff while failing to 
develop plans to restructure the work force. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it was experiencing financial difficulties and  
was forced to make the cuts to reduce costs. It also said similar 
cuts had been made in the administration and other departments. 
</P>
<P>
	ANSA's current strike was scheduled to end Saturday afternoon.  
It was not clear when the remaining days of strikes would occur. 
</P>
<P>
	A separate nationwide journalist strike planned for Friday was  
called off Thursday afternoon after the Italian Publishers 
Association agreed to renegotiate national journalist contracts.

<HEADLINE> Earnhardt Jr. Works in Dad's Shadow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- No mustache. No scowl. Frosted blond  
hair instead of jet black. 
</P>
<P>
	When most folks see Dale Earnhardt Jr. for the first time,  
they're sure to notice the differences between father and son right 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	So far in Earnhardt Jr.'s young career, however, it appears they  
share an ability to handle a race car. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the 24-year-old Earnhardt Jr. won the Busch Grand  
National Series in his first full season on the circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	It quickly earned him the nickname The Imitator, playing off The  
Intimidator nickname his father picked up while riding to seven 
Winston Cup series titles over two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Little Dale begins defense of the Busch title Saturday at the  
NAPA Auto Parts 300. 
</P>
<P>
	And before that, there's an even more intriguing showdown: the  
International Race of Champions Series on Friday, in which he will 
race against his father for just the second time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure, I'd like to beat him,'' Earnhardt Jr. said. ``But I'd  
like to beat them all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At an exhibition race in Japan last November, Earnhardt Jr.  
finished sixth and his dad finished eighth. Everybody loved it when 
the son bumped into his father about midway through the race, but 
Earnhardt Jr. downplayed the episode. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a bump, just tapped him a little bit, that's it,'' he  
said. ``No big deal. No family dispute came out of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt Jr. was just getting into the sport while his father  
was in the prime of his Winston Cup career in the late '80s and 
early '90s. 
</P>
<P>
	He credits his dad no more than any other driver for his  
success. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hardly ever saw him, because he was always traveling,''  
Earnhardt Jr. said. ``I learned by watching TV, or going to races 
and seeing how they do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The distant relationship has continued, mainly because of their  
hectic schedules. 
</P>
<P>
	``We get along fine,'' Earnhardt Jr. said. ``We just don't have  
long-term discussions about my future, or how to drive cars, or how 
to build cars. We don't talk that stuff. We just don't have time to 
do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the elder Earnhardt has kept an eye out for his son.  
</P>
<P>
	After watching him go through uneventful seasons with part-time  
rides on the Busch series in 1996 and '97, Dad decided to put Dale 
Jr. in the Busch car he owns. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a decision that surprised almost everyone, especially  
crew chief Tony Eury. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody looked at us like we were crazy,'' Eury has said.  
``They said there ain't no way we could take that kid and win a 
championship. He learned faster than anybody I've ever worked 
with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the first championship in the bag, Earnhardt Sr. has plans  
to move his son up to the Winston Cup series on a limited basis 
this season before he moves up full time next year.

<HEADLINE> Federated Buys Fingerhut Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Federated Department Stores Inc. is buying  
Fingerhut Cos. Inc., giving the parent of such stores as Macy's and 
Bloomingdale's a major boost in direct selling to shoppers through 
catalogs and the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Federated announced today that it will purchase Fingerhut in a  
$1.5 billion cash deal that sent Fingerhut shares soaring 30 
percent. Fingerhut will be a subsidiary of Federated, but will 
remain based in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Fingerhut's expertise in handling orders through catalogs and  
the Internet, plus its abilities in database management and direct 
marketing, will help Federated expand its non-store retail 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, Federated has Bloomingdale's By Mail and Macy's By Mail  
direct mail catalogs and the Macys.com Internet site. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will help Federated become a pacemaker in the field of  
e-commerce and catalog retailing,'' said Kurt Barnard, a retail 
consultant and president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report in Upper 
Montclair, N.J. ``They needed a distribution network which was more 
efficient than anything they had -- and they got that with this 
deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fingerhut shareholders will receive $25 a share in cash.  
Federated will also assume $470 million in Fingerhut debt. The 
boards of directors of both companies have approved the deal, which 
is subject to regulatory approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Federated said that the acquisition may reduce its earnings, but  
declined to give any specific figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's deal is the latest example of a department store taking  
aggressive steps to expand beyond just their stores. As seen during 
the holiday season, consumers are anxious and eager for shopping 
alternatives, and are beginning to aggressively explore the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Last March, Dayton Hudson Corp., another large department store  
chain, purchased direct-seller Rivertown Trading Co. At the time of 
the deal, Dayton Hudson said Rivertown's direct-selling expertise 
would put it in a good position ``if Internet retailing becomes 
more important in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fingerhut's core catalog generates most of the company's  
approximately $2 billion in annual sales. Fingerhut also operates 
catalogs under the names of Figi's, a food and gift catalog; 
Arizona Mail Order and Bedford Fair, both apparel catalogs; and 
Popular Club, a membership-based general merchandise catalog. 
</P>
<P>
	Fingerhut operates its own World Wide Web sites and has minority  
interests in four electronic-commerce companies: PC Flowers &AMP; 
Gifts, an online provider of flowers, gift baskets and gourmet 
food; The Zone Network, parent company of mountainzone.com; 
FreeShop.com, an online provider of free merchandise and links to 
other e-commerce sites; and Roxy Systems Inc., an Internet marketer 
of digital communications and entertainment services. 
</P>
<P>
	Federated has annual sales of more than $15.8 billion. The  
retailer operates more than 400 department stores in 33 states 
under the names Bloomingdale's, The Bon Marche, Burdines, 
Goldsmith's, Lazarus, Macy's, Rich's and Stern's.

<HEADLINE> IOC Criticizes McGwire Over Andro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseball's home-run king came in for more  
criticism from a top Olympics official Thursday for his use of a 
strength-building supplement considered a banned drug by other 
sports bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	Things would be different if Mark McGwire flunked a drug test  
for using Androstendione at the Summer Games, IOC vice president 
Dick Pound said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If that had happened at the Olympic Games, there would have  
been a huge uproar,'' Pound said in a conference call with 
reporters. ``But in professional sports, it doesn't seem to have 
mattered at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire openly used ``andro'' last summer as he hit a  
record-shattering 70 home runs. The substance is banned by the 
Olympics, the NFL and the NCAA but allowed by Major League 
Baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, at a world summit on drugs in sports, Pound  
criticized baseball for allowing McGwire to become a ``souped-up'' 
hero.

<HEADLINE> Habibie Seeks a Free East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie  
indicated today he favored independence for East Timor, saying the 
disputed territory's political future could be determined by the 
end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If someone asks me about East Timor, my suggestion is, give  
them freedom. It is just and fair,'' Habibie told a business 
delegation at the State Palace. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to be bothered by East Timor's problem anymore  
by Jan. 1, 2000,'' Habibie said. ``We will fully concentrate on the 
interests of our remaining 26 provinces.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did not elaborate. However, he also said Indonesia's other 26  
provinces had been unified since independence in 1945 and for 350 
years of Dutch colonial rule before that. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia has offered to withdraw from East Timor and declare it  
independent if the East Timorese reject an alternative autonomy 
deal for the half-island territory. 
</P>
<P>
	The autonomy offer is now the subject of U.N.-sponsored  
negotiations between Indonesia and Portugal, East Timor's former 
colonial master. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia invaded in 1975 and declared East Timor its 27th  
province in 1976. Since then, the territory has been wracked by 
guerrilla war and human rights abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Until recently, Indonesia refused to consider granting  
independence to East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	However, its policy toward the territory softened after former  
autocratic President Suharto, who ordered the invasion 24 years 
ago, quit power last May after riots and protests. 
</P>
<P>
	Habibie, a former protege of Suharto, has dismantled many  
features of his predecessor's rigid political legacy and has 
scheduled parliamentary elections on June 7. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, East Timor's jailed rebel chief, Xanana Gusmao,  
was moved from a Jakarta prison to house arrest to allow him a 
bigger role in peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
	The transfer was a conciliatory move that showed how much  
Indonesia has eased its stand on the East Timor question. The 
government once condemned Gusmao as a common criminal but now 
acknowledges he has a key political role in any negotiated 
solution.

<HEADLINE> Steel Buyers Worry About Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Oil driller Gary Green sympathizes with steel  
producers fighting a tide of cheap imports, but he worries more 
that any government help they get would increase his costs for 
equipment made of steel. 
</P>
<P>
	As steel producers press the Clinton administration to levy  
steel tariffs and impose other sanctions, others ask that the 
government consider effects of such a decision on the overall 
economy, not just the steel industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry blames at least 10,000 layoffs and three  
bankruptcies on the import surge. But while 200,000 people work in 
steel production, more than 8 million -- people like Green -- work in 
manufacturing and other steel-consuming industries. 
</P>
<P>
	``To the extent there are favoritisms levied for domestic steel  
producers, really the people like us, the roughnecks that work in 
the fields, we lose jobs,'' said Green, who runs Gary Drilling Co. 
in Bakersfield, Calif., with his father, Ed. 
</P>
<P>
	Drilling contractors already are reeling from low oil prices  
worldwide and from tariffs imposed in 1995 on imports of a special 
type of steel tubing essential to their business. After foreign 
producers largely pulled out of the U.S. market, drillers faced 
price hikes and order backlogs of up to two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Green said tariffs being considered on a more common product,  
hot-rolled carbon steel, could have a bad effect on business. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department is to make a preliminary determination  
Friday on whether to impose steel tariffs against Japan, Russia and 
Brazil. The domestic steel industry alleges that imports are being 
dumped in U.S. markets at prices dramatically below production 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy steel users in manufacturing and construction, many  
enjoying import-driven price reductions, also face having to pay 
more for their raw materials if tariffs are added. 
</P>
<P>
	The steel buyers ``are sorry that some of the domestic mill  
suppliers are having financial difficulties, but frankly their job 
is to make money for their shareholders, too,'' said Tom Stundza, 
executive editor of Purchasing, a Newton, Mass.-based magazine for 
industry buyers. ``I don't know of any buying group that's been 
weeping any tears over the fact that the price of metal came 
down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even the companies that buy most of their steel domestically  
under long-term arrangements immune to short-term pricing 
variations are worried about the impact of tariffs on worldwide 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors Corp.'s Alan Adler said cutting off the U.S.  
market could raise production costs for foreign producers and 
affect prices of steel bought for GM's overseas plants, which make 
cars for foreign sales. The auto maker buys 5 million tons of steel 
a year worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1995 government study estimated that tariffs to combat dumping  
cost the U.S. economy close to $1.6 billion more than the benefits 
they provide in terms of sales and protected jobs. Critics say that 
study takes a snapshot of the economy and fails to reflect the 
temporary nature of lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Steel prices in the United States have dropped as much as $75 a  
ton from the $350 level before Asia's economic crisis lowered 
demand for steel abroad and forced foreign producers to seek U.S. 
outlets. 
</P>
<P>
	Although imports dropped sharply in December, levels remain  
above those of 1997. Steel producers are pressing on with their 
dumping case, saying tariffs are needed to make import prices 
comparable to prevailing domestic levels. 
</P>
<P>
	``For buyers, really it's a false short-term benefit,'' said  
Roger Schagrin, a lawyer for eight U.S. steel producers. ``If it 
wasn't stopped we would not have a viable steel industry left to 
supply them in the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said domestic production still accounts for about 60 percent  
of U.S. steel consumption, down from 80 percent before the import 
surge. 
</P>
<P>
	Some steel users are sympathetic to the producers' complaints.  
Heavy-equipment manufacturer Caterpillar Inc. supports using 
existing trade laws, which allow tariffs, to address unfair trade 
practices, although the company cautioned against giving the steel 
industry the stronger sanctions it wants. 
</P>
<P>
	Even free-trade advocates in Congress agree that U.S. trade laws  
must be enforced. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can increase the cost of goods, to be sure, but the goods  
are being unrealistically sold,'' said Rep. Philip Crane, R-Ill., 
chairman of the House Ways and Means subcommittee on trade. ``Short 
term, it's beneficial from a consumer's standpoint, but it's not 
proper or good in the long term because you create those kinds of 
disruptions where you're destroying our capabilities.''

<HEADLINE> Possible Cancer Protector Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It would be a powerful tool for women: a gel  
or cream they could apply just before sex to protect against AIDS 
or other sexual infections, without having to get the man to agree 
to a condom. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists have spent years hunting such a ``topical  
microbicide'' with little luck so far, although they have some 
early candidates that might fight the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
	But Penn State University researchers announced a surprise: an  
experimental microbicide that promises to protect against both HIV 
and a sexually transmitted virus that causes deadly cervical 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a common ingredient in shampoos and toothpastes, so  
researchers already know it is safe; it also is cheap. 
</P>
<P>
	Many chemicals are being tested for anti-HIV action. After all,  
the AIDS virus is spreading most rapidly in heterosexual women. 
</P>
<P>
	But Penn State microbiologist Mary Howett's discovery of the  
first chemical that also destroyed human papilloma virus, or HPV, 
has researchers intrigued. The National Institutes of Health 
cautiously hopes that first-stage testing of sodium dodecyl sulfate 
could begin in a small number of women later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're excited about the broad-spectrum nature,'' said Dr.  
Penny Hitchcock, NIH's microbicide chief. The HPV protection is 
particularly intriguing because ``it's been a lot harder for us to 
find anything that works with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But we're cautious,'' she stressed, because researchers have  
lots of work -- including turning the ingredient into a usable 
vaginal gel -- before initial testing could begin. 
</P>
<P>
	Human papillomavirus is a common sexually transmitted infection.  
About one in four women is estimated to have a strain of HPV. 
</P>
<P>
	Most HPV is symptomless, but some strains go on to cause  
cervical cancer that kills 5,000 American women and 250,000 women 
worldwide every year. (The global toll is so high because 
developing countries cannot afford Pap smears, tests that let most 
American women discover cervical abnormalities before they grow 
into actual cancer.) 
</P>
<P>
	``If you could eliminate (HPV), you could potentially prevent  
all those cancers,'' Howett explained. 
</P>
<P>
	Microbicides are gels or films that women would insert into the  
vagina before sex to protect against various sexually transmitted 
diseases. So far, none has panned out. A study just found that the 
popular spermicide nonoxynol-9, long thought the best hope for an 
anti-HIV gel, does not protect after all. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists now are studying whether other spermicides or  
chemicals could work instead, and the NIH is spending millions to 
help. 
</P>
<P>
	One approach in early testing is an acid-buffer gel. Semen is  
very alkaline, raising the pH level of a woman's vagina enough to 
help acid-averse HIV infect more easily. The gel would maintain a 
vagina's natural acidity in hopes of killing HIV. 
</P>
<P>
	But until now, no experimental microbicides have blocked the  
tougher cervical cancer virus. 
</P>
<P>
	In the February journal Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy,  
Howett reported that in test-tube studies, the ingredient SDS 
inactivated the AID and herpes viruses. Like other experimental 
microbicides, SDS is a detergent that dissolves the fatty coating 
that holds those viruses together. 
</P>
<P>
	The cervical cancer virus is coated with tightly packed proteins  
that mere detergents cannot dissolve. But SDS also is a 
``denaturing'' agent -- and it picked those proteins apart. 
</P>
<P>
	After it worked in test tubes, Howett injected human cells with  
the cancer virus or with SDS-treated virus and then implanted those 
cells inside mice. The treated human cells grew normally with no 
evidence of HPV infection. The untreated cells grew into genital 
warts. 
</P>
<P>
	It will take years to prove whether SDS will work in the bedroom  
as well as the lab. Still, Howett calls SDS ``a major step toward 
... producing a practical, nontoxic, inexpensive, discreet 
product'' to protect women's sexual health.

<HEADLINE> Army Freshens Up Recruiting Offices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- The Army has decided to put fresher faces  
in its recruiting offices, a strategy aimed at boosting enlistment 
in the face of a projected shortfall of recruits this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``What this will do is give us a better contact with our target  
population and give us credibility and rapport,'' said Maj. Gen. 
Evan Gaddis, commander of the U.S. Army Recruiting Command at Fort 
Knox, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army plans later this year to staff offices nationwide with  
several hundred young, single recruiters, some of them corporals in 
their early 20s. Recruiters typically have been mid-career soldiers 
in their late 20s to mid-30s. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first fiscal quarter for the year, the Army fell behind  
its goals by about 2,400 recruits, The State newspaper of Columbia 
reported today. At that rate, the Army could fall far short of its 
goal of 74,500 recruits. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army also is working harder to keep new recruits. The rate  
at which soldiers in their first enlistment quit the service rose 
to 40 percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Army commanders say a robust economy has made recruiting tougher  
among a generation of young people that has little connection to 
military life. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's prospective recruits were ``in grammar school during  
Desert Storm,'' said Lt. Col. Jim Helis, a 1979 West point graduate 
who heads the Columbia Recruiting Battalion. ``To an 18-year-old, 
Vietnam is as distant as World War II was to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Army isn't alone in trying to attract young men and women  
recruits. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy, faced with 22,000 job vacancies, announced last month  
that it would start accepting more recruits who have not earned a 
high school diploma. The Army has been doing the same. And the 
Marine Corps and Air Force -- which historically have had the least 
trouble recruiting -- have been adding recruiters and boosting 
advertising so they won't fall behind.

<HEADLINE> Va. Officials Probe DNA Test Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) -- A delay in getting DNA tested led to  
the release of a rape suspect, who allegedly raped and killed 
another woman 11 days later. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials are investigating why it took three months for  
Virginia Beach police to receive the test results from a state lab. 
The tests ultimately matched the man to semen found in the first 
rape victim. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears it may have been human error,'' said Dr. Paul  
Ferrara, head of the state Division of Forensic Science. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 31, an 18-year-old woman was raped and stabbed by a man  
who dragged her behind a vacant house. 
</P>
<P>
	Police suspected Christopher Lamont Banks but did not have the  
evidence to charge him. When he was arrested Oct. 20 on a 
shoplifting charge, prosecutors persuaded a judge to jail him while 
they waited for a DNA test. 
</P>
<P>
	The lab received the semen and samples of Banks' blood and hair  
on Nov. 13, Ferrara said this week. Detectives called the lab daily 
asking for results. They were told the testing had to be sent to 
Richmond because a new lab was being built in Norfolk, Ferrara 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 6, prosecutors dropped the shoplifting charge and Banks  
was freed. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven days later, Jemma Saunders, 22, disappeared. She was  
later found raped and slain. Investigators said Banks and Ms. 
Saunders had been seen getting into a car together. Banks, 28, was 
arrested Jan. 23 and jailed without bail on murder and rape 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Police finally received the test results Feb. 3.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite stock index was well on its  
way to recovering from a five-session rout this morning, pushed 
higher by a recovery in technology shares. Blue-chips regained 
their footing after a shaky opening. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was up 50.34 at  
2,359.84, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 11.86 at 
1,235.41. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 40.94 at 9,218.25, reversing an early downturn. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq trading was led higher by technology leader Dell  
Computer, which was up 1 1/2 at 98 1/2 in leading volume. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues pulled ahead of decliners by 4 to 3 on the New  
York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 243 million shares, up 
from Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders were reluctant to trust the rally just yet. ``I've got  
green all across my screen, but this is a very volatile market, and 
who knows how long it can continue?'' said Scott Bleier, chief 
investment strategist at Prime Charter. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank stocks got a lift after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan  
Greenspan, testifying before the the House Banking and Financial 
Services Committee, endorsed a bill that would make it easier for 
financial services companies to combine their businesses. Greenspan 
said the legislation would help the United States economy remain 
dominant. 
</P>
<P>
	Citigroup was up 1 at 53 3/8, reversing an early loss.  
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Meets New German Chancellor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Putting his troubles at home behind him,  
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder met Thursday with President 
Clinton for the first time since taking office last fall and said 
his country's willingness to support a Kosovo agreement with troops 
signals a ``new quality of partnership'' between Germany and its 
NATO allies. 
</P>
<P>
	On an unusually warm midwinter day dominated by the Senate  
impeachment trial of the president, Clinton and Schroeder discussed 
Russia, global financial problems and other issues, apart from 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Schroeder hailed the ``fabulous quality'' of the  
U.S.-German relationship and said it was ``a joy'' to also discuss 
issues such as education, economics and the environment with the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder, who spent three hours with Clinton, came here in a  
somewhat weakened position politically back home after a 
parliamentary election that deprived him and his Social Democratic 
Party of a safe majority in Germany's upper house. 
</P>
<P>
	Elected in September, Schroeder took office in October,  
succeeding Helmut Kohl, the Christian Democratic leader who was 
defeated after 16 years at the helm in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton escorted Schroeder from the White House, but did not  
talk to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder said they did not discuss the impeachment case. ``I am  
not interested in that subject at all,'' he said, speaking through 
an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
	Meeting with reporters, Schroeder said the degree of German-NATO  
collaboration nowadays would have been inconceivable not long ago. 
</P>
<P>
	He said there are no differences between the United States and  
Germany on Kosovo. But, he stressed the importance of the Serbs and 
Kosovo Albanians reaching an early agreement in their talks that 
began last weekend in Rambouillet, France. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot permit that they negotiate for weeks on end,'' he  
said. He added that the international community has no reason to 
abandon its policy of resorting to military intervention, if 
needed, in the event the talks break down. 
</P>
<P>
	National Security Council analyst Anthony Blinken told reporters  
there was a ``very strong meeting of the minds'' between Clinton 
and Schroeder on Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both expressed strong support for the peace process ongoing at  
Rambouillet,'' Blinken told reporters. ``They also both expressed 
strong support for maintaining a NATO threat of force if it proves 
necessary if the peace effort does not bear fruit at Rambouillet. 
</P>
<P>
	``And the president welcomed the strong German commitment to  
this effort and to working for peace in Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder, giving examples of Germany's more assertive role in  
NATO, pointed to the presence of German troops in Bosnia and in 
Macedonia, where they form part of a force prepared to evacuate 
international monitors from Kosovo, as necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	The news conference was held at a local hotel but, beforehand,  
Schroeder met briefly with reporters on the White House grounds 
after visiting with Clinton. He said he and Clinton discussed ways 
of supporting Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States of America and Germany both have enormous  
vested interest in stabilizing the situation in Russia,'' Schroeder 
said. ``We very much think that it's very important ... that we go 
in and stabilize Mr. Primakov, because we think at this point in 
time stabilizing Mr. Primakov helps in stabilizing Russia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blinken cautioned against reading too much into Schroeder's  
reference to Primakov instead of Russian President Boris Yeltsin, 
saying the emphasis at the meeting was on supporting the reform 
process in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they were talking about Russia, not personalities,''  
Blinken said.

<HEADLINE> Shell Has Fourth Quarter Losas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The Royal Dutch-Shell Group of Cos. lost an  
unexpectedly large $3.7 billion in the fourth quarter, citing 
falling crude oil prices and the Asian recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Shell's profit for the year fell sharply and the energy company  
said Thursday any immediate improvement would be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Europe and the U.S., a possible economic slowdown could  
affect oil demand growth and may restrict any further upswing in 
the margins,'' the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shell shares dropped 2.7 percent in Amsterdam and 3.4 percent in  
London following the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss for the October-December period contrasted with a  
profit of $1.63 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue for the quarter fell 20 percent to $34.60 billion from  
$43.29 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said oil prices were 33 percent below a year ago and  
the Asian recession hurt profits in its chemical products business. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, earnings skidded to $350 million from $7.753  
billion in 1997. Revenue sank to $138.27 billion from $171.66 
billion in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Moody-Stuart, chairman of the committee of managing  
directors, said Shell's results were worse than for some of its 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is inescapable is that we have allowed the competition to  
overtake us,'' he told reporters in London. ``But I can tell you 
that we will reverse this situation by implementing the remedial 
measures we announced in December.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those included plans to dispose of eight chemicals business,  
closing four national head office and reducing investment by a 
third. 
</P>
<P>
	Moody-Stuart said the group is on course to achieve a 14 percent  
return on average capital employed by 2001, provided oil prices 
reach an average $14 a barrel by that time. 
</P>
<P>
	Brent crude oil is now selling at about $10 per barrel, and is  
likely to stay there for some time, he added.

<HEADLINE> Airline On-Time Performance Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Transportation Department's inspector  
general wants the government revise the procedures it uses for 
gathering statistics to rate the airlines' on-time performances. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report issued Wednesday, inspectors found the 10 major  
airlines reporting departure information use four different methods 
for defining when their planes have ``departed.'' A similar 
inspector general report last year found problems with how airlines 
calculated flight arrival information. 
</P>
<P>
	Airlines regularly use the arrival results in their  
advertisements, and both the departure and arrival information is 
used in reports issued by the Transportation Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``Differences between these methods could result in an aircraft  
being reported as departing on time when another aircraft -- in the 
same situation -- could be reported as departing late,'' wrote 
Lawrence Weintrob, assistant inspector general for auditing. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspection found that airlines use different standards for  
defining ``departure'': releasing an aircraft parking brake, 
rolling an aircraft's wheels, closing the passenger and-or cargo 
doors and closing its doors and releasing the parking brake.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Rises Record 96.05 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks stormed back Thursday from a  
five-day rout, pushing the Nasdaq to its biggest one-day point gain 
ever and other stock market indexes higher as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite, which is heavily weighted with technology  
shares, gained 96.05 to close at 2,405.55. The Dow Jones industrial 
average climbed 186.15 to close at 9,363.46, the day's high. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow is up 1.98 percent for the year but still nearly 280  
points from its all-time closing high of 9,643.32. The Nasdaq made 
back its losses from the previous two sessions and remains 100 
points shy of its all-time closing high. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 composite added 30.49 to 1,254.04.  
</P>
<P>
	Although the indexes made strong advances, some traders worried  
that the rally was too narrowly confined to technology shares to be 
trusted as a trend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until you can find another sector to take some leadership, I'm  
not convinced we're going to run a heck of a lot higher from 
here,'' said Elon Spar, co-head of block trading at Credit Suisse 
First Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancers had a nearly 3-to-2 lead on the New York Stock  
Exchange. Volume was moderately heavy at 972.51 million, up from 
Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally in technology shares was sparked by Lycos, which  
surged 16 to 103 1/4 on speculation that the Internet portal company's 
merger with USA Networks Inc.'s electronic retailing operations and 
Ticketmaster Online Citysearch Inc. would be scrapped. 
</P>
<P>
	CMGI Inc., which owns 20 percent of Lycos, said it will not  
support the proposed merger at Lycos' Wednesday closing price of 
87 1/4. Lycos, whose shares have fallen from 127 1/4 since the deal was 
announced, had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The reports lifted shares of CMGI by 19 15/16 points to 112,  
Ticketmaster by 2 1/4 to 39 3/8, and USA Network's shares up 3/4 to 40. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Dell Computer led Nasdaq issues higher, gaining 4 7/8 to  
101 7/8. Stocks on the Big Board were led higher by IBM, which gained 
9 5/8 to 178 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Other sectors of the market also fared well.  
</P>
<P>
	Shares of banking and financial services companies rose after  
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, testifying before the 
House Banking and Financial Services Committee, endorsed a bill 
that would make it easier for financial services companies to 
combine their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said the legislation would help the U.S. economy  
remain dominant. But he also indicated he was still at odds with 
the Clinton administration about who would regulate the newly 
combined companies, damping hope that a financial modernization 
bill was close to passing. Citigroup rose 1 1/4 to 53 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Retail stocks, which had been beaten down earlier this month,  
rose even after the Commerce Department reported an anemic 0.2 
percent growth in retail sales in January, their smallest gain 
since last summer. Dow member WalMart added 4 7/8 to 85 13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Federated Department Stores said it will acquire  
catalog retailer Fingerhut in a bid to beef up its catalog and 
Internet sales. Federated's shares fell 2 13/16 to 39 7/8, but shares 
of Fingerhut rose 5 5/8 to 24 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	In other market activity, the NYSE composite index rose 11.13 to  
589.74, and the American Stock Exchange composite index rose 10.59 
to 699.41. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 8.20 to 406.16.  
</P>
<P>
	In foreign stock markets, trading in Tokyo was shut down for a  
holiday, but the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong rose 0.78 percent. In 
Europe, the DAX index in Frankfurt rose 0.89 percent, the CAC in 
Paris rose 1.76 percent, and the FT-SE 100 index in London added 
2.05 percent.

<HEADLINE> BOT's New Chairman Eyes Alliances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago Board of Trade's new chairman says  
there's no rush to link up with competitors despite increasing 
threats to the exchange's dominance, but he indicated he is open to 
new alliances. 
</P>
<P>
	Just two weeks after the exchange abandoned a proposed alliance  
with Frankfurt, Germany-based Eurex, an all-electronic exchange and 
its fastest-growing competitor, David Brennan signaled Thursday 
that an on-again, off-again courtship with crosstown rival the 
Chicago Mercantile Exchange is back on track. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need strategic partners or alliances in order to compete to  
increase efficiency and expand production distribution on a global 
scale,'' Brennan said in remarks at the Futures Industry 
Association's Chicago division annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan said he's recently had ``open-minded'' discussions with  
his counterparts at the Merc and at the Board of Trade's sister 
exchange, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, about sharing 
technology and cross-distribution of products. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I'm not limiting this to other exchanges,'' he said. ``If  
there are opportunities to cut costs and increase efficiencies by 
joining forces in some way, we will pursue them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Brennan indicated he is committed to maintaining the  
150-year-old tradition of open outcry, in which traders stand in 
pits yelling and gesturing to set the price for everything from 
soybeans to Treasury bond futures. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics call the system an anachronism in today's world of  
electronic trading, which is cheaper and easier, and say exchanges 
that refuse to act quickly are doomed to extinction. 
</P>
<P>
	``In today's global environment, our exchange needs an  
electronic trading system that is seen by our users and potential 
competitors as being totally reliable,'' Brennan said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he added: ``The issue is not screen versus pit. Nobody wants  
to subsidize open outcry to fight off electronic trading. The best 
solution is somewhere in the middle -- where you have a seamless, 
automated order flow to our liquid markets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Large member firms contend there is no middle ground,  
complaining bitterly about the cost of maintaining separate staffs 
at various exchanges when one person potentially can do the work 
from a computer and the separate costs of clearing trades. 
</P>
<P>
	But the various exchanges repeatedly have tried and failed to  
merge, either completely or by combining redundant back-office 
operations. Those attempts have failed largely because of turf 
battles about whose systems are best. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Brennan says the day will come.  
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to take the long-term view to this,'' he said in  
remarks after his speech. ``Just to do it because it sounds good is 
no reason to do it.''

second White House run, former Gov. Pete Wilson is building more 
debt on top of bills still unpaid from his presidential campaign 
four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican's latest campaign finance statements show his  
principal presidential campaign organization -- a remnant of the 
1996 White House bid -- is $347,691 in debt, up nearly $47,000 from 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson piled up the new bills by meeting with political  
consultants, traveling and paying for direct mail during his last 
year as governor here. 
</P>
<P>
	His three federal campaign committees had a total of $377,305 in  
the bank as of Dec. 31 -- a mere fraction of the $20 million to $25 
million Wilson figures it will cost to compete in the GOP 
presidential primary campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson has said he must decide whether he will enter the race by  
this spring. And with the first primary about a year away, Wilson's 
dearth of cash raises questions as to whether he can finance a 
national race. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can certainly extinguish any doubts by raising an enormous  
amount of money in a short amount of time,'' said John Pavia, a 
political aide to 1996 GOP nominee Bob Dole. ``But to take a look 
at his balance sheet right now, anyone looking to get behind a 
presidential candidate would have to be a little bit concerned 
about Pete Wilson's financial status.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some in Wilson's camp see it differently.  
</P>
<P>
	``If he runs, he will run debt-free,'' said longtime associate  
Sean Walsh, who was Wilson's gubernatorial spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Paul Shaffer To Lead All-Kids Band </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Paul Shaffer is about to become the leader of  
the World's Smallest Band. 
</P>
<P>
	It won't actually be called that, but David Letterman's sidekick  
and musical director has signed with Nickelodeon to put together an 
all-children band that will produce original music for the cable 
network. 
</P>
<P>
	Nickelodeon will audition kids from across the country during  
the next year, and Shaffer will select the winners. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, the network wants to start a music-based series that  
will be produced by Shaffer, who headed up the World's Most 
Dangerous Band when Letterman was at NBC. Letterman is now at CBS, 
and Shaffer's band is called the CBS Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
	``My 5 1/2-year-old daughter is particularly excited at the  
prospect of getting to meet Chuckie'' from ``Rugrats,'' said 
Shaffer, who is not quitting his night job. ``My accountant was 
excited about receiving the advance.''

<HEADLINE> Texas Executes Man in Beating Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A man who beat a woman to death 20  
years ago and confessed to three other murders was executed by 
injection Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Danny Lee Barber came within an hour of being executed Dec. 9,  
when a federal judge issued a stay after Barber's attorneys raised 
questions about Texas' clemency procedures. The judge later upheld 
the procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	Barber, 43, was condemned for the 1979 attack on Janice Louise  
Ingram, 50, at her home in the Dallas suburbs. Barber described the 
killing as a burglary that went wrong and blamed it on alcoholism 
and depression. 
</P>
<P>
	Barber also confessed to three other murders in Dallas County  
between 1977 and 1979, earning him life sentences for each. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry for whatever pain I've caused,'' he said in his  
final statement. ``I pray you get over it. I am regretful for what 
I done, but I am a different person from that time.''

<HEADLINE> IOC: Sponsors Are Still Supportive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Olympics' corporate sponsors remain supportive despite the  
corruption scandal that has scarred the games' image, the IOC's 
sponsorship chief said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Pound, the IOC vice president who negotiates key television  
and marketing deals, said international sponsors endorse the IOC's 
efforts to clean house following the Salt Lake City bribery case. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sponsors have been very supportive of the efforts we've  
been making to date to clean up this problem,'' Pound said in a 
conference call from New York. ``There is nobody that has 
withdrawn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound, who met with sponsors in New York, said there was no  
indication corporations were considering pulling out. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sponsor group has been very good, proper and  
businesslike,'' he said. ``They say, `We understand you have 
problems, we appreciate what you are doing to clean up and we are 
supportive of your efforts to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting between Olympic officials and sponsors lasted about  
three hours. Mike Sherman, a spokesman for Visa International, 
said, ``We voiced our concerns and encouraged reforms and they 
listened,'' but declined to offer further details. 
</P>
<P>
	Other sponsors and IOC spokesmen either didn't return phone  
calls or declined to comment on the substance of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the only outspoken critic among the sponsors has been  
David D'Alessandro, president of John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro announced this week that his company was canceling  
negotiations with NBC for $20 million in ads to protest the IOC's 
handling of the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	John Hancock is part of the IOC's TOP program, a group of 11  
international sponsors who pay around $50 million each for 
exclusive rights to use the five-ring Olympic logo in ads. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro said John Hancock will also remove the Olympic  
rings from its annual report, company stationery and certain 
venues. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound downplayed Hancock's protest.  
</P>
<P>
	``John Hancock has postponed its television discussions, which  
is an add-on to its sponsorship,'' he said. ``I have spoken with 
Mr. D'Alessandro. There is no question of abandoning or thinking of 
abandoning the Olympic sponsorship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Thursday, an executive of General Motors Holden, a major  
sponsor of the Sydney Olympics, expressed concern about the growing 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``New things seem to be coming to the surface each day and each  
time it obviously adds to the concern that we have,'' John Morrison 
of GMH told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	While Morrison said the company was ``disturbed'' by the  
revelations, it was a ``long way'' from considering withdrawing its 
Sydney sponsorship. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate interview with The Associated Press in New York,  
Pound said critics should wait for the outcome of a special IOC 
meeting in March, called to deal just with the corruption issue, 
before voicing concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our response, and I've discussed it with Dave, is, `Look. We  
have the message. We had the message a while ago,''' Pound said. 
```We are dealing with this. And, please, let us get on with the 
solution to this and you can judge the solution when we get to 
mid-March. And if you don't think we've done it right when all the 
smoke is cleared, then, please, make your point then.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said in the conference call that TV ad sales in North  
America and Australia are ``way ahead of schedule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He described D'Alessandro as ``the most positive'' of Olympic  
sponsors in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	``John Hancock has made fabulous use of that sponsorship for the  
betterment of the business,'' Pound said. ``I think he would like 
very much to continue it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said D'Alessandro believes he is helping the IOC by  
keeping up pressure on the committee to deal with the crisis. Pound 
said that's not necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are saying that even without that pressure we would be  
doing the same thing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound also countered D'Alessandro's suggestion that IOC  
president Juan Antonio Samaranch has failed to handle the crisis 
and may be near the end of his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a problem (Samaranch) acknowledges has arisen on his  
watch and has become a serious problem,'' Pound said. ``He wants to 
make sure action is taken to clean up and whatever changes are 
necessary to take us into the future are done under his leadership. 
I think that's important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For now, Pound said, Olympic sponsorship ``is still a fabulous  
investment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 2000 Games in Sydney still have $128 million in sponsorship  
outstanding, but Sydney Lord Mayor Frank Sartor remains hopeful 
that sponsors would view the scandal as a temporary problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think sponsors can see through the current cloud which is  
blowing over us and which will blow away soon enough,'' Sartor 
said.

<HEADLINE> Hearst Takes 50 Pct. Stake in Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Talk magazine's powerful new partner will help  
it debut with a shout. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearst Corp., one of the country's leading magazine publishers,  
is taking a 50 percent stake in Talk, the new monthly being 
developed by Miramax Films and Tina Brown, the controversial former 
editor of The New Yorker. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearst, whose titles include Esquire and Cosmopolitan, will  
oversee circulation for the year's most widely anticipated new 
magazine. The deal, announced Thursday, marks one of the last major 
steps for Talk heading toward its August debut. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearst will provide the new magazine with the benefit of its  
long-standing relationships with newsstands and its huge database 
of subscribers, in addition to financial backing. Terms of the deal 
were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Talk will launch with a circulation of 500,000 and should  
generate strong interest given Brown's reputation and Miramax's 
growing renown in the movie business. The studio released two of 
this year's best-picture Oscar nominees, ``Life Is Beautiful'' and 
``Shakespeare in Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, whose six-year tenure at The New Yorker drew more readers  
but many critics of her flashy style, said Talk has already formed 
its editorial staff and the launch is progressing smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown and Miramax have not provided much detail about Talk's  
content, but it promises to be a celebrity-filled general interest 
magazine to compete with the likes of Vanity Fair, another magazine 
Brown once edited. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you will see a magazine that has a kind of intimacy, a  
kind of excitement that is not right now out there in the 
marketplace,'' she said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearst will have no editorial control over the magazine. But  
taking a stake in Talk will broaden Hearst's portfolio, which is 
known for women's magazines and other special interest titles such 
as Good Housekeeping, Redbook, Popular Mechanics, Town &AMP; Country. 
It also co-publishes SmartMoney with Dow Jones &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``This moves us into new and exciting markets and we think  
(Talk) is really going to create a whole new generation of 
journalism,'' said Cathleen Black, president of Hearst's magazine 
division. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal also extends the relationship between Hearst and Walt  
Disney Co., Miramax's parent company. The publisher owns stakes in 
Disney's ESPN cable sports network and magazine, and the two 
companies co-own the Lifetime and A&AMP;E cable networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown left The New Yorker's parent, Conde Nast Publications, in  
July to join Miramax in creating Talk Media, which will publish 
books and produce television programs in addition to the magazine. 
She is chairwoman of Talk Media and editor of the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald Galotti also stepped down as publisher of Vogue, another  
Conde Nast magazine, to join the venture and serve as Talk 
publisher. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown has also hired two veterans of both The New Yorker and  
Vanity Fair, David Kuhn and Caroline Graham, as executive editor 
and West Coast editor, respectively. Other key hires have been Tom 
Watson, former editor of the weekly Legal Times, as enterprise 
editor, and British book publishing veteran Jonathan Burnham as 
editor in chief of Talk Media's book division.

<HEADLINE> Experts: Court Will Uphold Miranda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans, having witnessed untold numbers of  
arrests in movies and on TV, know the drill: ``You have the right 
to remain silent. Anything you say may be used against you in a 
court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot 
afford one, an attorney will be appointed for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Supreme Court's 1966 Miranda decision requiring police  
nationwide to give such warnings before questioning criminal 
suspects is under attack. A new federal appeals court ruling could 
spur the justices to restudy the landmark case that has made 
numerous confessions or incriminating remarks to police 
inadmissible as evidence when offered by people who had not been 
read their rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal experts doubt the Supreme Court will let state and local  
police ignore its decision called Miranda vs. Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this goes to the Supreme Court, the justices will have to  
decide whether they want to toss out more than 30 years of 
jurisprudence that's stemmed from Miranda,'' said Stephen 
Saltzburg, a George Washington University law professor. ``I don't 
think they'll go for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	University of Michigan law professor Yale Kamisar said, ``It  
would be an interesting battle, but I think Miranda would win 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Miranda decision was steeped in the constitutional  
protection against self-incrimination, but the Supreme Court never 
explicitly said the Constitution requires such warnings to guard 
against police coercion. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruling in a Virginia bank robbery case earlier this week, a  
three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said a 
long-ignored 1968 federal law trumped the Miranda decision and 
freed federal law enforcement officers from having to give the 
familiar warnings in every case. 
</P>
<P>
	That ruling is now binding law in the 4th Circuit's five states  
-- Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina and West 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress said in the 1968 law that evidence obtained without the  
warning being given could be used at trial as long as federal 
judges are sure the statements were made voluntarily. The law says 
compliance with Miranda is just one factor to be considered. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven presidential administrations, Republican and Democratic  
alike, have refused to enforce that law, however, out of concern 
for its constitutionality. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ... have determined the Supreme Court has concluded that  
(Miranda) is constitutionally based since ... it has applied it to 
the states as well,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said Thursday. 
``It would be up to the Supreme Court to make the determination 
that it was not constitutionally based.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's highest court is far more conservative than it was  
33 years ago, and several of its members -- most notably Chief 
Justice William H. Rehnquist -- repeatedly have played down the 
Miranda decision's constitutional dimensions even as the court 
rebuffed numerous attempts through the 1970s and early 1980s to 
overturn it. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no groundswell to get rid of Miranda,'' Kamisar said.  
``Most police like it because it makes life simple. If it's not 
broken, why fix it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Virginia case likely will be referred to the full 4th  
Circuit court, and then to the Supreme Court. ``This is not a case 
the Supreme Court would duck'' if the three-judge panel's reasoning 
is upheld by the entire appeals court, predicted Northwestern 
University law professor Ronald Allen. 
</P>
<P>
	And what if the Supreme Court agrees that the 1968 federal law  
is valid? ``You'll see numerous state legislatures adopting state 
analogues,'' Allen said, leaving police forces free to re-examine 
their policies on questioning criminal suspects.

<HEADLINE> Co. Predicts Weather a Year Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WAYNE, Pa. (AP) -- Predict the weather a year from today in any  
city in the country? Nonsense, meteorologists say. 
</P>
<P>
	But Frederick Fox, a self-proclaimed weather prophet, offers a  
money-back guarantee that it can be done and will tell Internet 
users the best time to get married, plan a ski trip or even sell 
rain gear. 
</P>
<P>
	``Others think along the chaos theory -- that the atmosphere is  
chaotic in nature and can't be forecasted with any accuracy beyond 
a few days,'' he said. ``But we think the universe has order and 
everything is predictable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For only $19.95, dates and destinations for the year will be  
suggested in less than a minute via his Web site, 
weatherplanner.com. For one- to 10-day forecasts, it costs $14.95. 
The company claims its accuracy rate is better than 70 percent and 
that only a dozen of the 3,000 customers over the past year have 
asked for refunds. 
</P>
<P>
	Eastern Mountain Sports of Peterborough, N.H., relies on  
WeatherPlanner to manage its inventory of clothes and outdoor gear 
in 76 stores. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives us a better idea of what kind of demand we'll be  
facing from season to season according to the weather 
fluctuations,'' company spokesman Alan Margulius said. ``It's 
definitely helped us increase profitability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fox said he relies on about 100 years of historical data from  
the National Weather Service and a theory that everything, even 
weather, happens in cycles. He wouldn't be more specific about his 
patented system. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Meteorological Society says there is no verifiable  
way to forecast day-to-day weather changes a season or even a month 
in advance. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service insists that accurate forecasts are  
possible only two weeks in advance with modern physics and 
technology, said Allan Eustis, industrial meteorologist for the 
agency in Silver Spring, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the guy is necessarily a heretic because there  
are cycles and different ways to look at things,'' Eustis said. 
``But would I buy it? No way. I don't think there's enough skill in 
it. But remember, I'm a mainstream scientist.''

<HEADLINE> House Counsel Lashes Out at Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Grudgingly resigned to President Clinton's  
acquittal, the lawyer who directed the House impeachment inquiry 
called the president's trial a ``sham'' and said Thursday that 
House prosecutors ``were cut off at the knees'' by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel there was no fair trial. There was no constitutional  
trial in the Senate. I think that the constitutional system has 
been irrevocably harmed,'' David Schippers said in an interview on 
the eve of a vote that senators in both parties agree will acquit 
the president of perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Schippers, the GOP investigative counsel for the House Judiciary  
Committee when it staged the impeachment inquiry, said the 13 
Republican lawmakers who prosecuted the case ``did everything we 
could with the minimal tools they allowed us to use.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He criticized senators for settling for videotaped testimony  
instead of allowing witnesses to testify live. ``They refused to 
let us prove our case,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The former federal prosecutor, a hardened veteran of organized  
crimes cases, was selected by the House Judiciary Committee 
chairman, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., to investigate whether Clinton's 
efforts to conceal an extramarital affair amounted to impeachabale 
offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Though a Democrat from Chicago, Schippers quickly became a  
lightning rod for criticism by Democratic defenders of the 
president. He recently was the subject of a supermarket tabloid 
report that suggested he had an extramarital affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the report, Schippers would not comment except:  
``That's garbage. It's a nonissue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now that he's leaving town, he's holding back none of his  
opinions. ``I can say things that maybe some of those congressmen 
won't say because I'm going to be out of here,'' he said. ``But I 
have to say what I believe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He criticized senators who announced they would vote to acquit  
the president because they didn't believe House proved its case. 
``It's a sham. The whole trial was a sham,'' he said. ``I felt that 
the managers were cut off at the knees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate never wanted to hold the trial, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``From the day they presented the impeachment articles to the  
Senate,'' Schippers said, ``it seemed like the whole attitude of 
the senators was `We don't want to be bothered. We don't want to be 
annoyed.'''

        Poverty rates and median incomes in 1995, as reported by the  
Census Bureau. The list shows the percentage of people who lived below 
the poverty line in 1995 and in 1993, along with the median household 
income for 1995. The median income means half the households had incomes 
higher and half lower. In 1995, a family of four was considered poor 
if its annual income was below $15,569. For a family of three, the 
poverty line was $12,158.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft VP Queried on Downloading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government challenged a senior Microsoft  
executive Thursday on his claim that people can quickly and easily 
download Web browsers over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft Vice President Brad Chase testified, under  
cross-examination in his company's antitrust trial, that 
downloading a Web browser -- either Microsoft's own Internet 
Explorer or the rival browser made by Netscape -- is a simple and 
usually successful process for most people. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressed by Justice Department attorney David Boies, however,  
Chase acknowledged it also can be time consuming. The process can 
take up to 50 minutes on a personal computer used at home, 
depending on the modem speed. 
</P>
<P>
	Chase insisted the process nevertheless remained an easy one.  
</P>
<P>
	``It takes a little bit of time, but not a lot. It's quicker  
than going to a store,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue is significant because of the company's claims that  
people who receive Microsoft's browser as part of their computer's 
operating system can simply choose to switch to another. Browsers 
are software that allow a computer user to view the World Wide Web. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department claims in its antitrust lawsuit that  
Microsoft used its monopoly power and illegal tactics to crush and 
discourage competition, including Netscape and its rival browser. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Microsoft employee, Joe Belfiore, a computer programmer  
who gave a deposition in the trial last March, cited ``tons of 
feedback that suggest that downloading IE (Internet Explorer) takes 
too long, is too hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You'll find that the number of hours that it takes to download  
these components over a phone line is incredibly discouraging to 
people, often fails, and the result is that people don't get an 
improved user experience at all,'' Belfiore said in his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Chase acknowledged that at the time, he oversaw efforts to make  
Microsoft's browser smaller to help make it more appealing to 
consumers. But he disagreed with Belfiore's suggestion that 
downloading is difficult. He suggested that Belfiore perhaps was 
engaging in self-critique popular in the ``Microsoft culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boies also presented Chase with a March 1997 e-mail, sent to him  
by another Microsoft employee, on how to get more people to use the 
company's browser. 
</P>
<P>
	``Almost 60 percent of all surfers have never downloaded any  
software from the Web. My sense is that these people are not very 
likely to download anything, let alone a browser that takes two 
hours to download,'' wrote that employee, Kumar Mehta. 
</P>
<P>
	The memo goes on to report that ``80 percent of those who do not  
use IE say they have no plans to switch to it, which means that if 
we take away IE from the o/s (operating system), most nav (Netscape 
Navigator) users will never switch to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chase said he had no problem with the report but disputed its  
interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
	In written testimony submitted to court earlier and released  
Wednesday, Chase said his company's superior technology prompted 
clients to choose Microsoft's browser over Netscape's. 
</P>
<P>
	Chase also challenged the testimony made by previous witnesses,  
who claimed it was Microsoft's industry influence as well as 
strong-arm tactics, that led them to sign contracts with the 
software giant.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Fall on Crop News / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly  
lower Thursday on the Chicago Board of trade in a continuing 
retreat following a government crop report that predicted most 
supplies will continue to build. 
</P>
<P>
	The entire market initially opened higher after U.S. Agriculture  
Department weekly export sales figures were unexpectedly strong, 
but prices were quickly eroded amid continuing concerns about ample 
U.S. supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans faced pressure from expectations Brazil, the  
second-largest grower behind the United States, will harvest a 
bumper crop -- at a time when world demand remains weaker than 
normal. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Agriculture Department is predicting the amount of  
soybeans left over before the next harvest will rise to 410 million 
bushels, a 13-year high and up from the 390 million bushels 
predicted last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and wheat also retreated amid prospects for large competing  
crops and weak U.S. export business. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery fell 4 1/2 cents to $2.62 3/4 a bushel; March  
corn fell 4 1/4 cents to $2.16 a bushel; March oats fell 1 3/4 cents to 
$1.05 1/4 a bushel; March soybeans fell 4 cents to $4.95 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and livestock futures were mostly lower on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	April live cattle fell .10 cent to 67.12 cents a pound; March  
feeder cattle fell .08 cent to 74.17 cents a pound; April lean hogs 
fell .58 cent to 46.27 cents a pound; March pork bellies fell 1.17 
cents to 56.35 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Heat Off at Russia Tennis Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) -- The ATP indoor tournament in  
Russia this week certainly isn't a hot event. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterburgsky Stadium officials were scrambling to keep the  
building heated Thursday as temperatures outside dipped to minus-18 
degrees. The stadium became another casualty of Russia's financial 
troubles when the local electricity provider cut off power right 
before the tournament because of unpaid energy bills. 
</P>
<P>
	The shutoff caused heating pipes to burst, and repair workers  
have been fixing them all week. 
</P>
<P>
	On the court, top-seeded Jan Siemerink advanced to the  
quarterfinals, defeating Fredrik Jonsson 7-6 (7-2), 6-2. Siemerink, 
who lost in the first round at the Qatar Open and Australian Open, 
won 88 percent of his first service points and never faced a break 
point. 
</P>
<P>
	He goes on to face Igor Kornienko, who on Wednesday won to reach  
the quarterfinals in ATP Tour event for the first time in his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's runner-up, No. 2 seed Marc Rosset, also reached the  
final eight, eliminating Sebastien Grosjean 6-2, 7-6 (7-2). 
</P>
<P>
	David Prinosil upset fourth-seeded Magnus Gustafsson 4-6, 6-3,  
6-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising Russian star Marat Safin, seeded fourth, advanced to the  
quarterfinals after beating Sebastien Grosjean 6-2, 7-6 (7-2). No. 
6 Dominik Hrbaty of Slovakia defeated Arnaud Clement 6-2, 6-3, and 
Guillaume Raoux beat Jens Knippschild 6-3, 7-6 (7-4).

<HEADLINE> Linda Tripp Defends Taping Lewinsky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Linda Tripp, whose secret tape recordings  
spurred the impeachment crisis, said Thursday she'd ``do it all 
again'' and expose a relationship in which President Clinton 
``abused, used, discarded'' former White House intern Monica 
Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	In her first television interview since the scandal broke more  
than a year ago, Mrs. Tripp told NBC that ``the public has no clue 
... absolutely no idea what Monica endured. ... the histrionics, 
the hysteria, the throwing of lamps, the damage to herself'' and 
that Clinton ``emotionally abused Monica.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``People think this'' relationship was ``consensual and that I  
inserted myself somehow,'' but ``it was not,'' Mrs. Tripp said in 
the interview, to be aired Friday on the ``Today'' show. The 
network released a partial transcript late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp has emerged as one of the most unpopular figures in  
the presidential scandal, accused of betraying her friendship with 
the younger Ms. Lewinsky by secretly taping the telephone calls in 
which she talked about her affair with the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp turned over the tapes to prosecutor Kenneth Starr but  
refuses to say in public whether she made them. She remains under 
investigation by Maryland authorities who want to know whether she 
violated the state's wiretapping law. 
</P>
<P>
	Save for her grand jury appearances and the release of her  
tape-recorded phone calls, Mrs. Tripp has seldom been heard from 
over the past year. During a brief statement on the courthouse 
steps, she told Americans she had been misunderstood and 
mischaracterized. ``I'm you,'' she declared then. 
</P>
<P>
	A former White House worker who now is employed at the Pentagon,  
Mrs. Tripp insisted that she would want someone to expose an 
improper relationship if it involved her daughter, just as she did 
for Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would thank them,'' Mrs. Tripp said. ``If my daughter found  
herself in a situation such as this where she was being abused, 
used, discarded, I would hope someone would come in and help her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I take exception to the fact that I brought this all about,''  
Mrs. Tripp declared, placing the blame squarely on Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``These were choices made by the president of the United  
States,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she took the actions she did because she was being  
asked by her friend to lie in Paula Jones' lawsuit against the 
president, a step that was ``not an option for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was worth it to me to do what I considered to be my  
patriotic duty'' and ``yes, I would do it all again,'' Mrs. Tripp 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	She did not admit in the interview to taping the phone calls,  
which she turned over to Starr in exchange for a federal grant of 
immunity from prosecution. If Mrs. Tripp were to admit the taping, 
the Maryland state prosecutor could use the information in his 
criminal investigation of whether she violated the state's 
wiretapping law.

<HEADLINE> Senators Bash Clinton in Private </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Disgraceful. Deplorable. Indulgent and  
immoral. Boorish. A disgrace upon the office of presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	One by one, for three straight days, senators have stood in  
their closed chambers, where the cameras stopped rolling earlier 
this week, and heaped these seething words upon the president of 
the United States. And these are Democrats who intend to vote 
Friday for his acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have been even more extreme. ``The most  
accomplished, polished liar that we have ever had serving in the 
White House,'' Sen. Robert Bennett of Utah said of Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Such emotional, vitriolic name-calling would never be tolerated  
on the floor of the Senate on a normal day. Rules and decorum 
wouldn't allow it. But this is no ordinary Senate proceeding. And 
the intensity of rebuke and disdain for Clinton behind closed doors 
has amazed even some who have participated in it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have stood on the floor of the Senate as Senator (Robert)  
Byrd has rebuked senators who have called the president a liar. But 
it came today over and over and over again from both sides of the 
aisle,'' Bennett said after emerging from a third full day of 
private debate over whether to remove Clinton from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the president's acquittal has long been sure, the  
deliberations have been an extraordinary forum for senators -- 
Republican and Democrat alike -- to excise their anger toward a 
president who cast an entire nation into an impeachment crisis it 
did not want through infidelity and deceit. 
</P>
<P>
	Many senators have made their private floor statements public  
and further described their feelings outside the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a catharsis of sorts. A cleansing of some of the pent-up  
anger. And a chance for Democratic senators to inform future voters 
that their decision to acquit Clinton doesn't mean they condone his 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	Just listen to their own words.  
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton was ``boorish, indefensible, even  
reprehensible,'' declared Richard Bryan of Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Graham, a Democratic conservative from Florida, laced  
together a string of stinging adjectives for his statement. ``The 
president's self-indulgent actions were immoral. Disgraceful. 
Reprehensible. History should -- and, I suspect, will -- judge that 
William Jefferson Clinton dishonored himself and the highest office 
in our American democracy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif, noted that her daughter is married  
to the brother of Hillary Rodham Clinton so ``I am far from being a 
defender of the president's behavior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Herb Kohl, a soft-spoken millionaire businessman from  
Wisconsin, got into the act, too. He said Clinton's action had been 
``wrong, reckless and indefensible'' and that ``this president has 
done real damage to the office of the presidency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, frustrated that Clinton's popularity coupled with  
public unhappiness with the impeachment effort have turned the 
crisis into a liability for their own party, let their vitriol fly. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., said Clinton had acted in ``low and  
illegal ways.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even Bennett, an ordinarily reserved senator from Utah,  
unleashed a harsh attack on camera after the debate wrapped up 
Thursday. He predicted that Clinton would become part of the 
lexicon as ``a synonym for an elegant, well-crafted lie.''

<HEADLINE> Witness Testifies in Marines Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A Marine jet that was traveling ``very  
fast'' descended rapidly moments before it struck a ski gondola 
cable in the Italian Alps, killing 20 people, a witness testified 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander Angerer, a snowboard instructor who was teaching a  
group in the Mount Cermis area the day of the tragedy, said at 
Capt. Richard Ashby's court-martial that his first thought was, 
``He's crazy ... because the jet was flying so low over the 
village.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It went very fast, following the slope,'' he said. He added  
that the jet then descended below where he was on the mountainside, 
lower than he had ever seen a military jet reach before. 
</P>
<P>
	``First it was above me, then it was on the slope. It went  
below,'' Angerer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, an analyst for the Naval Safety Center in Norfolk,  
Va., showed jurors computer-generated graphs showing the plane's 
position at various stages of the fatal flight. The positions were 
plotted from information on the data recorder on Ashby's plane and 
from ground and air radar. 
</P>
<P>
	``An accident investigation is like putting a jigsaw puzzle  
together without all the pieces, and radar data is one element,'' 
said the analyst, Chip Brown. The judge let the display be shown 
over the objections of Ashby's attorneys, who said it contained 
errors. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., was piloting the EA-6B  
Prowler on Feb. 3, 1998, when it sliced the cable over the Italian 
village of Cavalese. He is charged with 20 counts of involuntary 
manslaughter, destroying government and private property and 
dereliction of duty. If convicted on all charges, he faces more 
than 200 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, witnesses said Ashby's jet rustled tree tops as it  
swooped over the valley with a roar moments before striking the 
cable. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was almost at the top of the trees,'' 16-year-old Andrea  
Mover of San Michele all'Adige, Italy, testified. ``Just as the 
plane passed by the tops of the two trees, I saw the tops moving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mover testified that his home is on a route commonly used by  
military planes, but that Ashby's jet was ``much lower than they 
usually go.'' He said he watched the jet from a window in his home. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors contend Ashby was negligently flying too fast and  
too low -- in violation of an altitude restriction of 1,000 feet. 
The cable was hit at about 360 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers say Ashby will tell the jury his map didn't have  
the ski gondola marked on it and that his jet's radar altimeter -- 
which measures flying altitude -- was faulty. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Bleggi, a surveyor working near a mountain ridge near  
Chivo, Italy, testified that he heard the Prowler before he saw it. 
Bleggi, of Trento, Italy, also told jurors he watched the jet make 
a clockwise rotation, allowing him to see the belly of the jet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Apart from the fact I had never seen a plane so low, I was  
very afraid because of the noise,'' Bleggi testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, maintenance officer Lt. Col. Gary Eugene Slyman  
and Capt. Scott Roys testified that the jet's radar altimeter had 
malfunctioned on two earlier flights but was fixed. 
</P>
<P>
	And Chief Warrant Officer Jeffrey Poncelet said his analysis of  
tapes from the Prowler showed the jet had exceeded its 517 mph 
speed limit during 89 percent of the ill-fated flight. 
</P>
<P>
	The Prowler's navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31, of  
Westbury, N.Y., is awaiting trial next month for the deaths.

<HEADLINE> Andrews Says She's Unable To Sing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's been nearly two years since Julie Andrews  
had throat surgery, and there's still no sound of music coming from 
her lips. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrews, who in December dismissed reports that her singing  
career is over, now concedes she's been unable to sing since she 
underwent surgery to remove non-cancerous throat nodules. 
</P>
<P>
	The 63-year-old Andrews, Broadway's ``Fair Lady'' whose voice  
swept across the hills in ``The Sound of Music,'' said she is 
considering filing a lawsuit over the operation. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she will keep trying to sing, though doctors don't give  
her much hope it will happen. She said she tries to be optimistic 
but thinks she is in denial about her problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``To not sing with an orchestra, to not be able to communicate  
through my voice which I've done all my life and not to be able to 
phrase lyrics and give people that kind of joy, I think I would be 
totally devastated,'' she told Barbara Walters in a ``20/20'' 
interview to air tonight.

<HEADLINE> VA Must Review Agent Orange Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The Veterans Administration must review all  
benefit claims denied to hundreds of Vietnam veterans who failed to 
say their illnesses resulted from exposure to Agent Orange, a 
federal judge ruled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government has paid some benefits to about 6,000  
Vietnam veterans who developed cancer and other illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	But an estimated 1,000 veterans were denied back payments under  
strict language that required applicants to state that Agent Orange 
or herbicides were linked to the cause of the disability or death, 
a hurdle ruled illegal Thursday in the class-action lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Under VA regulations, veterans do not have to prove they were  
exposed to Agent Orange or other herbicides containing the toxic 
substance dioxin. In fact, anyone who served in the war is 
automatically presumed to have been exposed to it. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1989 court ruling in the case voided all VA benefit decisions  
it had made based on the agency's assertion that only the skin 
disease chloracne was linked to Agent Orange. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the VA has since recognized that a variety of cancers  
are connected to the defoliant, it has failed to review claims made 
prior to the 1989 ruling and continued to insist that benefit 
applicants state that their disability resulted from exposure to 
Agent Orange, the court found. 
</P>
<P>
	``We agree with plaintiffs that the VA's approach is  
inconsistent with both the spirit and intent of this court's 
decision, as well as the liberal nature of the VA's own claims 
process,'' U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``The court expected that the VA would revisit those benefit  
decisions that had been erroneously decided under the invalidated 
regulations,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs wanted the VA ordered to pay the benefits, but  
Henderson ruled that the agency should revisit the denied claims. 
With benefits denied as far back as 1985, retroactive payments 
would average $70,000 per person, plaintiffs' attorney Bart 
Stichman said. 
</P>
<P>
	No one knows how many people suffer from the effects of Agent  
Orange, which was sprayed over wide swaths of jungle by U.S. planes 
during a 10-year period to strip away cover from enemy troops and 
their convoys. 
</P>
<P>
	A call to U.S. Justice Department attorney Karen Richardson  
seeking comment Thursday evening was not returned.

<HEADLINE> Mich. Schools Offer Creation Books </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- A Michigan school district has decided to supply  
some of its libraries with books that raise questions about the 
validity of evolutionary theory. 
</P>
<P>
	The Melvindale-Northern Allen Park School Board on Monday  
endorsed placing the books in its junior high and high school 
libraries for students to reference voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
	Board President John Rowe, a self-described creationist, said  
the books were legitimate works of scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
	``The books are scientific textbooks that offer scientific  
evidence that evolution may not be true,'' he said. ``I think any 
time we can have our students gain additional knowledge from 
credible science, we should do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not so, said Eugenie Scott of the California-based National  
Center for Science Education, which helped the district evaluate 
the books. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some books that are just a joke,'' she said Tuesday.  
She labeled several of the books on the district's list as 
``mainline anti-evolution,'' ``frankly religious'' and ``bad 
science.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rowe said the Detroit-area district wanted to advise students  
that evolution is a theory about the origin of human life, not 
scientific fact. 
</P>
<P>
	Evolution still causes trouble for teachers and school officials  
more than a decade after the Supreme Court ruled that public 
schools cannot teach that God created the universe. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the National Academy of Sciences said evolution must  
be taught in public schools if children are to understand biology 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization issued a guidebook for teachers, parents and  
school administrators that asserted: ``There is no debate within 
the scientific community over whether evolution has occurred, and 
there is no evidence that evolution has not occurred.''

<HEADLINE> British Telecom Profits Shrink </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- British Telecommunications PLC reported Thursday  
that profits were down in the third quarter compared to a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported pretax profits of 858 million pounds ($1.42  
billion) in the three months ending Dec. 31, on sales of $7.78 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In the comparable period of 1997, the company had pretax profits  
of $1.8 billion on sales of $6.77 billion. Pretax profits for the 
third quarter of 1997 were boosted by a $453 million merger breakup 
fee following the termination of BT's merger agreement with MCI. 
</P>
<P>
	BT shares were up 9 percent at midday on the London Stock  
Exchange, as investors were encouraged by the company's strong 
growth in revenue.

<HEADLINE> Rep. Wants Transplant Spat Settled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Differences over how to allocate scarce organs  
for transplant should be settled through negotiations between the 
Clinton administration and the network that coordinates 
transplants, an influential House Republican said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no reason they can't work this out,'' said Rep. John  
Porter, R-Ill., who said he does not want Congress to get involved 
this year as it did in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, at the transplant network's urging, Congress twice  
delayed plans by the Health and Human Services Department to change 
the way organs are distributed. 
</P>
<P>
	HHS wants the United Network for Organ Sharing to remake the  
national allocation system, which relies heavily on geographic 
boundaries in distributing organs for transplant. Organs should go 
to the sickest patients who could reasonably benefit from a 
transplant, no matter where they live, HHS said in a regulation 
published last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The network, governed by representatives from across the  
transplant community, wants to keep the system the way it is. 
Furious that HHS was ordering it to make changes, the network 
persuaded Congress to delay the regulation, which is now on hold 
until the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's a legislative solution to this problem.  
It has to be negotiated out,'' Porter, chairman of the House 
Appropriations subcommittee that handles much of the HHS budget, 
told HHS Secretary Donna Shalala. She was before his subcommittee 
to discuss her department's budget request for 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Shalala responded that she would like to negotiate a solution.  
</P>
<P>
	``We will work with the transplant community but we would very  
much appreciate you sending them a message at the same time that 
they need to work with us,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides met several times over the summer but have not  
talked since August. The network recently asked for another meeting 
but has not yet heard back from HHS, said Joel Newman, spokesman 
for the network. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would support and would look forward to additional  
discussions with HHS,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Senators Take Advantage of Leeway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators went their own ways in deciding how  
to vote in the impeachment trial, illustrating the broad authority 
granted the Senate by the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Statements released by senators outside their closed  
deliberations showed a wide variety in their interpretation of the 
facts and the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt., believes President Clinton  
obstructed justice in hiding his affair with Monica Lewinsky, but 
the ``low and tawdry'' facts do not warrant ousting him from 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Wayne Allard, R-Colo., said Thursday the president  
committed obstruction and perjury, and that both offenses meet the 
``high crimes and misdemeanors'' standard set by the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., said, ``I've discussed it little with  
anybody,'' that perjury and obstruction meet the constitutional 
standard for removal, but the proof on the facts fell short. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the Constitution gives the Senate the ``sole power'' to  
try impeachments, the senators' role is different from that of 
jurors in ordinary trials. Such jurors decide the facts but are 
instructed to apply the law as explained by a judge. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate rules on the facts but also decides for itself what  
the law means -- in this case the constitutional language that 
requires that the president be removed from office on conviction of 
``treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's misguided for the senators to say they are forced to one  
conclusion or another by the Constitution,'' said Georgetown 
University law professor Louis Michael Seidman. The Constitution 
deliberately left the legal standard open-ended, he said, adding: 
``They are making up the standard as they apply it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffords said the Constitution's framers ``clearly intended  
impeachment for only the greatest offenses. ... The actions in this 
case do not reach the high standard of impeachment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allard's constitutional interpretation differed. ```Oath' is the  
foundation of our justice system and to violate the legal oath does 
put our republic at risk,'' he said in announcing he would vote to 
convict on both counts. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., contended House prosecutors failed to  
prove either charge on the facts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president has dodged perjury by calculated evasion and  
poor interrogation,'' Specter said. ``Obstruction of justice fails 
by gaps in the proofs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senators were allowed to decide for themselves what level of  
proof the House prosecutors had to meet. Specter, a former 
prosecutor, settled on the standard used in criminal law, proof 
beyond a reasonable doubt. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., who planned to vote to acquit, said  
several allegations of obstruction against Clinton ``crash on an 
immovable evidentiary rock: Monica Lewinsky's uncontradicted and 
often repeated statement, `No one ever asked me to lie, and I was 
never promised a job for my silence.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., said ``the facts, the stubborn  
facts'' -- ironically quoting the words of Deputy White House 
Counsel Cheryl Mills -- persuaded him to vote for conviction on both 
charges. ``Everywhere I turned, I just had to suspend my common 
sense too much, too often, on too many turns in this road, to find 
him innocent,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., split the difference between the  
perjury and obstruction charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president should be removed from office for obstruction of  
justice,'' Gorton said. ``On perjury, although the president lied, 
this specific case of perjury does not rise to a level requiring 
removal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some senators said they were mindful their words could set  
precedents for future interpretations of the Constitution's 
impeachment clauses, either raising or lowering the bar. 
</P>
<P>
	However, George Washington University law professor Stephen  
Saltzburg disagreed. ``The bar will be where both houses place it 
at any given time,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Iran Marks Islamic Revolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Verses from the Koran read over mosque  
loudspeakers echoed through Tehran today while hundreds of 
thousands gathered to mark the 20th anniversary of Iran's Islamic 
revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to the crowd at Tehran's Freedom Square, President  
Mohammad Khatami marked the anniversary by promising to usher in a 
new era of order and law. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stability of the revolution is only possible with the rule  
of law,'' said Khatami, whose moderate policies have irked 
hard-line clergymen and sparked charges that he was undermining the 
revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	``Defending the revolution is defending the constitution,''  
Khatami said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, helicopters hovering above Freedom Square showered the  
crowds with colorful leaflets. Free soft drinks and sweets were 
distributed in the streets surrounding the square, a symbol of 
Iran's 1979 revolution that toppled the pro-Western monarchy of the 
shah and installed a clergy-led regime. 
</P>
<P>
	In a message to the nation on the eve of the anniversary, Iran's  
supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said: ``Our great revolution 
marched on its arduous road with pride and confidence'' despite 
``hostile acts'' by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pioneer and harbinger of irreconcilable enmity (with Iran)  
was the American government and its Zionist appendix in the Middle 
East,'' Khamenei added, alluding to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	But the only obvious anti-Western hint in today's gathering at  
Freedom Square came when several demonstrators set fire to two 
American flags and an effigy of Uncle Sam. 
</P>
<P>
	The festivities also included several firsts for the Islamic  
republic. Actors dressed as Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny and a 
variety of animals sang and danced in a carnival-like parade. 
</P>
<P>
	There also was a pop concert, and Italian composer and singer  
Franco Battiato is to perform in Tehran for three nights next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Such events point to how much the government's restrictions on  
music and dance have been eased since the reform-minded Khatami 
took office in 1997. He has been accused by Islamic hard-liners of 
undermining the revolution by relaxing Islamic social restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Khatami's promises of more political freedoms for Iran's 60  
million people have angered powerful hard-line rivals who control 
key institutions such as the judiciary, the security forces, the 
intelligence network and the office of Khamenei, who has the last 
say on all matters. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past 18 months, hard-liners have resorted to more  
violence to deal with pro-Khatami opponents. Vigilantes have 
attacked dissidents, liberal newspapers and even a reformist 
Cabinet minister. The intelligence minister resigned Tuesday after 
the department, controlled by hard-liners, admitted that its agents 
were involved in the killing of dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Khatami today called for civil rights to be respected, saying  
the best way to reach that goal was to participate in the running 
of the country, including local elections scheduled for February 
26. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite several parades and the lights, flags, banners and  
posters adorning trees and walls, the anniversary festivities were 
rather tame. Iran's economic woes, caused by record-low oil prices, 
have forced the government to cut spending. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's celebrations also fall on the anniversary of the  
death of a Shiite Muslim saint, Imam Jafar Sadeq, and so are less 
festive than usual. Several black flags of mourning flew alongside 
the banners of the Islamic Republic at Freedom Square. 
</P>
<P>
	State-run television ran live coverage of today's events at  
Freedom Square interspersed with footage from the days of the 
revolution -- mostly mobs clashing with troops of the shah's regime. 
</P>
<P>
	The anniversary festivities, which built to a crescendo today,  
began February 1, the day the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the 
father of the revolution, returned to Iran from France after 15 
years in exile. 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year rule of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi collapsed on Feb.  
11.

<HEADLINE> Man Acquited in NY Teacher Slaying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The second defendant in the robbery and murder  
of a high school teacher was acquitted Thursday of all charges 
despite 13 pages of self-incriminating statements that he gave to 
police. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury found Montoun Hart, 26, innocent of second-degree murder  
and first-degree robbery in the 1997 slaying of Jonathan Levin, the 
son of Time Warner chairman Gerald Levin. 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't prove their case,'' said one of several jurors who  
agreed to speak to reporters if their names were not used. ``We 
kept waiting for them to fit the man to the crime. They did not do 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hart had been accused of being an accomplice in torturing Levin,  
31, with a knife for his personal bank card number, looting his 
bank account of $800, then killing him. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart, who testified in his own defense, said he was drunk at his  
mother's house when detectives picked him up. He said they promised 
they would not let him leave unless he signed some statements they 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	A former student of Levin's, Corey Arthur, 20, was convicted in  
November of second-degree murder in the slaying and was sentenced 
last month to the maximum, 25 years to life. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Volvo Quarterly Profit Up 168 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Swedish vehicle maker Volvo AB reported  
a 168 percent surge in profits for the fourth quarter last year as 
higher sales across the board overcame weakness in the company's 
Asian operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo, which agreed last month to sell its automobile division  
to Ford Motor Co., earned 3.08 billion kronor ($397 million) in the 
three months ending Dec. 31, up sharply from from $143 million in 
the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose 19 percent to $8.08 billion from $6.80 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Besides its well-known car division, Volvo also makes trucks,  
buses, construction equipment and marine and aviation engines. The 
proposed sale of its car division to Ford for $6.45 billion is 
aimed at giving Volvo the resources to concentrate on developing 
its other divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo last month surprised markets by acquiring 13 percent of  
the stock in rival Swedish truck-maker Scania and is making an 
effort to buy the company. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, Volvo reported a profit of $1.11 billion, a fall  
of 16 percent from $1.34 billion the previous year despite higher 
sales in all divisions. Revenues rose 16 percent to $27.48 billion 
from $23.70 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo also reported sharply higher expenses in research and  
development, selling and administration, bringing the annual profit 
down. Other expenses affecting profit included $149 million for 
restructuring costs in its construction equipment division. 
</P>
<P>
	The automobile division reported sales for the year of $13.4  
billion, up from $12.45 billion the previous year. For the fourth 
quarter of 1998, car sales were $3.85 billion compared with $3.41 
billion for the same period in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo sold a total 435,680 cars worldwide in 1998, up from  
416,070 the previous year, despite sharply lower sales in Asia. 
Sales in North America grew to 110,700 from 101,980 and in Europe 
rose to 255,540 from 239,960. 
</P>
<P>
	Asian automobile sales declined to 24,970 from 36,170.

<HEADLINE> Witnesses Say Marine Jet Flew Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A Marine jet was streaking so low  
before it sliced through an Italian gondola cable, killing 20 
people, that people on the ground cowered and covered their heads, 
witnesses testified Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I bent down. I covered (myself) because I saw a danger for  
myself. I could see the plane very well on my eye level,'' Patricia 
Pichler, a German-speaking Italian, said through a translator. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she was watching her children take ski lessons on Mount  
Cermis in the Italian Alps on Feb. 3, 1998, when the EA-6B Prowler 
sliced the cable at 360 feet, sending the gondola crashing to the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot, Capt. Richard Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., is  
being court-martialed on charges including 20 counts of involuntary 
manslaughter. He could get more than 200 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Other residents of the area around Luson, Italy, recalled their  
terror as the jet roared down the alpine valley. Prosecutors have 
said the jet was going 621 mph when it hit the cable. 
</P>
<P>
	Maria Luise Messner said the jet appeared to clear an electrical  
tower beside the ski slope by about 30 feet. ``I thought, `My God, 
how could an airplane fly that low, that it is even possible for it 
to fly like that?''' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander Angerer, a snowboard instructor, said he thought the  
Prowler pilot was ``crazy'' because the jet flew so low and then 
descended, following the slope of the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, 16-year-old Andrea Mover testified that the jet  
rustled treetops as it swooped over the valley.

<HEADLINE> Patriots Move to Hartford Finalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Gov. John G. Rowland and New England  
Patriots owner Robert Kraft signed the final agreement early Friday 
morning to bring the team to Hartford. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was signed at 1:10 a.m., after lawyers in Hartford and  
Boston pored over the document for hours and communicated via 
conference calls. 
</P>
<P>
	After the lawyers finished going over the document, one page was  
faxed to Rowland and to Kraft for their signatures, said the 
governor's spokesman, Dean Pagani. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very complex agreement. It ties the state and the  
Patriots together for the next 30 years,'' Pagani said of the $374 
million stadium deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Agreement was reached hours before Rowland was scheduled to  
leave for Florida for a meeting of the Republican Leadership 
Council. He was scheduled to return Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Kraft, who had visited Hartford on Thursday, had returned to  
Massachusetts on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	This week was the third deadline Rowland and Kraft had set for  
the agreement to be signed. The deal was first expected to be 
finalized Jan. 15. That deadline was extended to last Friday, but 
Rowland and Kraft pushed the signing back to sometime this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Early Thursday evening, about 15 protesters gathered outside  
Rowland's residence to criticize the deal and the secrecy of the 
process.

<HEADLINE> Shakeup at Salt Lake Olympic Panel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Salt Lake's scandal-scarred Olympic  
committee launched an internal shakeup today that included hiring a 
new chief -- Massachusetts venture capitalist Mitt Romney. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal is to make Utah proud, to make America proud,'' Romney  
said in accepting the position. 
</P>
<P>
	As Gov. Mike Leavitt announced a sweeping reorganization of the  
Salt Lake Organizing Committee, including new rules at avoiding 
conflict of interest, two leading members resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC gave Romney its unanimous endorsement to take over the  
committee running the 2002 Winter Games, which has been rocked by 
the biggest corruption scandal in the history of the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``These games and the preparations leading up to the games will  
comply with the highest level of ethical conduct,'' Romney vowed in 
remarks to the SLOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt proposed expanding SLOC's board of trustees from 33 to  
50 and stripping it of its decision-making authority, making it an 
advisory board to a new management committee of 20. 
</P>
<P>
	He also gave any SLOC member with a perceived conflict of  
interest 60 days to resign. The proposal directly affects SLOC 
trustees Earl Holding and Alan Layton. 
</P>
<P>
	Layton immediately resigned. His construction company won a $29  
million contract to enclose the speedskating oval. 
</P>
<P>
	Holding, who remained on the committee, is the owner of  
Snowbasin Ski Area, which will get $13.8 million from SLOC as the 
downhill and super-G venue, and Little America Grand, a hotel being 
built downtown that is expected to be the IOC's home during the 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Also resigning was Verl Topham, president of Utah Power who had  
served on the original bid committee, saying he was doing so for 
the good of the games. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor also proposed an open meetings and records policy  
and that SLOC members be required to attend 75 percent of meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	He also urged the IOC to continue its housecleaning. ``We cannot  
allow the integrity of the Olympics to be eroded by indecisiveness 
or arrogance,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney, the choice of Leavitt and SLOC chairman Robert Garff,  
met with members of a hastily organized selection committee Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	That came just hours after the SLOC ethics committee released  
its report saying bid committee executives engaged in unethical 
conduct in spending more than $1 million to curry favor with 24 
International Olympic Committee members and win the right to hold 
the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney, 51, a Republican who unsuccessfully challenged Sen. Ted  
Kennedy in 1994, is the son of the late George Romney, governor of 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	He lives in Belmont, Mass., and also has a home in Park City,  
Utah. He graduated from Mormon church-owned Brigham Young 
University in Provo, Utah, and has been a Mormon bishop (lay leader 
of a congregation) and stake president (leader of a group of 
congregations) in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney's Boston company, Bain Capital Inc., specializes in  
buying companies and turning them around. Domino's was a recent 
acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has the perfect business background. He knows how to take  
major businesses in trouble and turn them around,'' said Henry 
Marsh, one of a handful of board trustees asked by Garff on Tuesday 
to peruse applications for the top SLOC job. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC ethics report linked another 10 IOC members to the  
scandal, bringing to 24 -- a fifth of its membership -- the number of 
delegates accused of accepting excessive benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said the ethics report was being forwarded to its own  
six-man panel investigating the Salt Lake City case. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine members have either resigned or been expelled by the IOC  
executive board. Three others remain under investigation, one 
received a warning and one has died. 
</P>
<P>
	Further expulsions are likely before the special IOC assembly in  
Lausanne, March 17-18. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you find something that's a real breach, we basically have  
only one sanction, and that's expulsion,'' said IOC vice president 
Dick Pound, head of the internal inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC executive board delegate Jacques Rogge, a member of Pound's  
panel, said it would determine whether members were guilty of 
actual ethical violations. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to differentiate between what is a breach of the  
line, and what is so-called `lavish treatment,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC marketing director Michael Payne, in New York today to meet  
with Olympic sponsors, said the IOC is doing everything in its 
power to stamp out corruption and institute reform. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the head of Olympics sponsor John Hancock insurance  
criticized the IOC's handling of the crisis and suggested that IOC 
president Juan Antonio Samaranch's tenure may be running out. 
</P>
<P>
	But Payne rejected the continuing calls from outside the IOC for  
Samaranch to resign, saying the 78-year-old president is needed to 
lead the house-cleaning efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the president stepped down, you would have a presidential  
election with all the instability that would bring,'' Payne said. 
``That's the last thing you want at this stage. You need a firm 
hand at the top to drive through the changes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Payne said there was no crack in support from the Olympic  
sponsors who pay tens of millions of dollars to help finance the 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sponsors are standing, first of all, behind the games,  
and, second, behind the steps and action the IOC, Samaranch and the 
executive board are taking,'' Payne said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--Leavitt and US West denied there was a connection between a $5  
million Olympic contribution by the phone company and Leavitt 
pushing telecommunications deregulation. However, Leavitt said he 
was dropping deregulation from proposed legislation to wire Utah 
government and schools for fast Internet service. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Salt Lake bid committee's outside auditors, the accounting  
firm Ernst &AMP; Young, denied the ethics report's allegations that it 
had failed to call attention to undocumented expenditures by 
Olympic bid executives. 
</P>
<P>
	It said it identified and discussed undocumented expenditures  
with senior management and the chairman of SLOC's audit committee. 
However, James Beardall, chairman of the audit committee, told The 
Salt Lake Tribune that ``I was not made aware of undocumented 
financial expenses.... On the contrary, I was assured by the bid 
committee's auditors that there were no items of special 
significance not previously reported which should be brought to the 
attention of the audit committee or the board of trustees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Barbados IOC member Austin Sealy, implicated in the Salt Lake  
report, denied any wrongdoing. Bid records showed $3,000 a month 
passed through a company affiliated with a consultant to Sealy.

<HEADLINE> David Hale Loses Bid To Stop Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Whitewater figure David Hale has lost a  
bid to avoid trial on charges he tried to fool regulators into 
thinking he had enough money in his insurance company to pay 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Hale, who has claimed President Clinton pressured  
him into loaning money for a land deal, argued before the Arkansas 
Supreme Court that the charge is based on statements he gave under 
an immunity agreement with Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth 
Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale's lawyers claim the statements cannot be used against him,  
but the Arkansas Supreme Court on Thursday sided with prosecutors 
who say they developed their case independent of Starr's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale also argued unsuccessfully that a trial would subject him  
to double jeopardy since his first ended in a mistrial. The court 
noted the mistrial was declared because Hale was having heart 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale's National Savings Life Insurance Co. was told by the  
Arkansas Insurance Commission to add $38,757 to its company account 
in 1993 to meet state regulations on minimum capital requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Hale moved the cash into the account to create  
the illusion of financial health, then took it out.

<HEADLINE> Snags Still Likely on American </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Travel problems still loomed today for American  
Airlines passengers despite a federal court order that disgruntled 
pilots climb back into their cockpits. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be spending the next couple of days trying to get the  
airline back on its feet,'' said John Hotard, a spokesman for Fort 
Worth, Texas-based AMR Corp., the parent company of the nation's 
second-largest airline. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be cancellations over the next several days, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	More than 200,000 travelers have been stranded across the  
country and 2,500 flights canceled since Saturday as pilots, angry 
over the slow integration of recently purchased Reno Air, started 
calling in sick. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Valentine and Kelly Young of Green Bay, Wis., found  
themselves stuck at Miami International Airport on Wednesday, 
worried they would miss their wedding in St. Lucia. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a three-day residency requirement in St. Lucia to get  
married,'' said Valentine, 37. ``If we don't get there today, our 
residency requirement won't be met.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For passengers with travel arrangements through Monday, American  
said it would offer full refunds on all tickets or help them 
reschedule their flight without the usual service charge or 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline estimated that 2,400 of its 9,400 pilots have called  
in sick. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall in Dallas told the pilots to get  
back to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you call in sick and you're not really sick, you're a  
liar,'' he said Wednesday, chiding the pilots' union and the 
airline, which sought the temporary restraining order because of 
the effects on service. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's silly for us to even be here,'' he said. ``It's like  
killing a gnat with a sledgehammer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pilots began calling in sick and refusing overtime early  
Saturday after talks broke down with the company about salaries 
paid pilots of Reno Air. American pilots are barred by federal law 
from striking over the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Reno pilots make half the $164,000 a year that an  
experienced American pilot makes. The American pilots want AMR to 
add Reno pilots to the higher pay scale more quickly, and want some 
of their own to move up the ladder. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR said that it will take about 12 to 18 months do that and the  
pilot union's demands would cost as much as $50 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Allied Pilots Association president Rich LaVoy said the pilots  
will be advised to abide the judge's order. During a previous pilot 
sickout against American in 1990, many failed to return despite a 
court order. 
</P>
<P>
	TWA, Delta and other airlines accepted American tickets in the  
same price class and waived the customary change of flight fee, as 
part of a pact between airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	But that didn't always help.  
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Hook, owner of James Hook &AMP; Co., a live lobster wholesaler  
in Boston, said a number of his outgoing shipments have been 
delayed by the slowdown and finding room on other airlines has not 
been easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been working the phones a lot, making sure we have a  
backup to a backup,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Southern Baptist Convention has withdrawn its recommendation  
that its 15.6 million members fly the airline to this year's annual 
meeting in Atlanta, scheduled for June. An average of 20,000 
members of the nation's largest Protestant denomination attend such 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	Convention officials said their decision is not based on the  
pilot sickout, but on the company's donation of $75,000 to pro-gay 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	American said Wednesday it never promised to stay neutral on gay  
issues.

<HEADLINE> Senators Take Advantage of Leeway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators are taking full advantage of the  
broad leeway granted by the Constitution in impeachment cases, 
judging by their explanations of how they plan to vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt., believes President Clinton  
obstructed justice in hiding his affair with Monica Lewinsky, but 
the ``low and tawdry'' facts do not warrant ousting him from 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Wayne Allard, R-Colo., said Thursday the president  
committed obstruction and perjury, and that both offenses meet the 
``high crimes and misdemeanors'' standard set by the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	And Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., said Clinton's conduct, though  
``boorish, indefensible, even reprehensible,'' does not require his 
removal because ``it does not threaten the republic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because the Constitution gives the Senate the ``sole power'' to  
try impeachments, the senators' role is different from that of 
jurors in ordinary trials. Such jurors decide the facts themselves 
but are instructed to apply the law as it is explained to them by a 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate rules on the facts, but also decides for itself what  
the law means -- in this case the constitutional language that 
requires that the president be removed from office on conviction of 
``treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's misguided for the senators to say they are forced to one  
conclusion or another by the Constitution,'' said Georgetown 
University law professor Louis Michael Seidman. The Constitution 
deliberately left the legal standard open-ended, he said, adding, 
``They are making up the standard as they apply it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffords, one of many senators to release statements outside the  
Senate's closed deliberations, said the Constitution's framers 
``clearly intended impeachment for only the greatest offenses.... 
The actions in this case do not reach the high standard of 
impeachment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allard's constitutional interpretation differed. ``'Oath' is the  
foundation of our justice system and to violate the legal oath does 
put our republic at risk,'' he said in announcing he would vote to 
convict on both counts. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., contended the House prosecutors  
failed to prove either charge on the facts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president has dodged perjury by calculated evasion and  
poor interrogation,'' Specter said. ``Obstruction of justice fails 
by gaps in the proofs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senators were allowed to decide for themselves what level of  
proof the House prosecutors had to meet. Specter, a former 
prosecutor, settled on the standard used in criminal law, proof 
beyond a reasonable doubt. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., who joined Specter and Jeffords in  
deciding against conviction on both counts, said he ``plowed my own 
furrow'' in interpreting the facts and law. Chafee said the crimes 
of perjury and obstruction do meet the constitutional standard for 
removal, but the proof on the facts fell short. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., who planned to vote to acquit, said  
several allegations of obstruction against Clinton ``crash on an 
immovable evidentiary rock: Monica Lewinsky's uncontradicted and 
often repeated statement: 'No one ever asked me to lie and I was 
never promised a job for my silence.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., said ``the facts, the stubborn  
facts'' -- ironically quoting the words of Deputy White House 
Counsel Cheryl Mills -- convinced him to vote for conviction on both 
charges. ``Everywhere I turned, I just had to suspend my common 
sense too much, too often, on too many turns in this road, to find 
him innocent,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., split the difference between the  
perjury and obstruction charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president should be removed from office for obstruction of  
justice,'' Gorton said. ``On perjury, although the president lied, 
this specific case of perjury does not rise to a level requiring 
removal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some senators said they were mindful their words could set  
precedents for future interpretations of the Constitution's 
impeachment clauses, either raising or lowering the bar. 
</P>
<P>
	However, George Washington University law professor Stephen  
Saltzburg disagreed. ``The bar will be where both houses place it 
at any given time,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Earnhardt Looking for a Little Luck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Dale Earnhardt doesn't need much luck  
the way his car is running. Still, he plans to add one more piece 
of equipment before defending his Daytona 500 title. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll go to the Daytona USA exhibit, which displays his winning  
Chevrolet from last year, and take his good-luck charm for Sunday's 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll pry that penny off that dash,'' Earnhardt said after  
another victory at Daytona International Speedway in the second of 
two qualifiers Thursday. ``I've got that penny marked, and I'll 
know if it's the same one. I've got it insured for a million.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's just about what the seven-time Winston Cup champion would  
get if he becomes the fourth driver in 41 years to win the world's 
premier stock car race two years in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides gluing the penny to his dash board, Earnhardt will make  
one other key change. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to put a fresh engine in it,'' said Earnhardt, who  
won his 10th straight qualifying race at Daytona and will start 
fourth on Sunday. ``I think we've got a good shot at winning this 
race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A new engine might be necessary because Jeff Gordon doesn't  
figure to stand pat. 
</P>
<P>
	With crew chief Ray Evernham's knack for making the right  
adjustments to their Chevy, Gordon figures to be tougher than he 
was in the first qualifier, when he finished second behind Bobby 
Labonte. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think because the temperatures are going to get cooler on  
Sunday, we're going to work on getting a little more speed out if 
it,'' Gordon said. ``We went with a good-handling race car today to 
see what kind of speed we could get out of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The temperature is expected to drop about 15 degrees into the  
mid-60s on Sunday, meaning the cars should run faster. Evernham 
guessed right last Saturday, when his setup in the time trials put 
Gordon on the pole for the 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Tony Stewart locked up the No. 2 spot in the trials, but  
the rest of the lineup was up for grabs Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon was more the victim of circumstance than the power of  
Labonte's Pontiac in the first qualifying race. Labonte squeezed 
him to the low side on the backstretch, catching Gordon behind 
lapped traffic for the winning pass. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was nothing I could do to hold him off,'' Gordon said.  
</P>
<P>
	Labonte, who blocked Gordon's attempt for a pass in the final  
lap, conceded that traffic was the key to victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no idea if I could have passed him if he hadn't got  
caught,'' said Labonte, who will start third in the 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon can see Labonte's strength, and hopes his own will give  
him an advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bobby's car might be a little faster down the straightaways,  
but I think our car is the best one through the corners,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because he was in the second qualifier, Earnhardt had a chance  
to watch Gordon. He'll have a closer view of the two-time defending 
Winston Cup champion on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon hopes to win his third straight series title, starting  
with his second Daytona 500 victory. But Earnhardt knows the front 
end of the field is loaded with fast cars and that he has more to 
worry about than just Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you focus on one, you'll lose site of what you want to  
be,'' said Earnhardt, who has won at the track a record 32 times. 
</P>
<P>
	In agreement is two-time Daytona 500 champion Dale Jarrett, who  
starts eighth Sunday. He says winning the race usually depends on 
being in the right place at the right time. 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone wants to find a drafting partner on the 2 1/2-mile track,  
but Jarrett says agreements to ride in tandem often are violated 
when drivers have a chance to improve their positions. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no deals out there,'' he said. ``If you believe in  
deals, you're in trouble.''

<HEADLINE> Ricky Williams Hires Master P </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- The ``haters'' whispered in his ear  
repeatedly that he should avoid hiring rap king Master P as his 
agent, said Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Texas running back came to Master P's new hometown  
anyway and announced Thursday he has signed with the celebrity's 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, expected to be one of the top two picks in the NFL  
draft, said he was besieged by people warning him against Master P. 
Some of them were other agents. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were saying don't do it,'' Williams said. ``He's not an  
agent, he's a businessman. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told Master P. Master P told me to ask them how much money  
they made last year. ... Master P came from nowhere and has gone to 
the top. We're on the same wave length.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Master P, born in one of New Orleans' poorest areas as Percy  
Miller, parlayed his rap records into a flourishing business with 
his own label, No Limit Records, and a financial interest in a 
professional sports agent business, No Limit Sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes Magazine lists Master P among the top 10 entertainers in  
terms of annual salary, at $56 million. 
</P>
<P>
	As Williams fielded questions at a news conference in a casino,  
Master P stayed in the background, watching. 
</P>
<P>
	An aspiring athlete, Master P was recently cut by the Charlotte  
Hornets after being invited to training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said he thinks he deserves to be the first pick in the  
draft but has met Kentucky quarterback Tim Couch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't feel bad if a quarterback went in front of me,'' he  
said. ``I met him and he's a nice guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new Cleveland franchise has the first choice and apparently  
is deciding between the two. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said his new agent has not decided which individual  
will actually sit down and negotiate for him. ``We're still talking 
about that.''

<HEADLINE> Well-Wishers Send Tyson Fan Mail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mike Tyson's lawyers were hoping Indiana would  
make the next move. Indiana authorities say they're waiting for 
Tyson's lawyers to act. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid the confusion, the former heavyweight champion remains in a  
county jail, where hundreds of well-wishers have sent him letters 
and gifts, including money to help pay off his debts. 
</P>
<P>
	The uncertainty increased Thursday when George Walker, Tyson's  
probation officer in Indiana, said that officials there are in a 
``wait-and-see'' mode concerning the 32-year-old boxer's one-year 
sentence for assaulting two motorists after a minor traffic 
accident in Gaithersburg, Md., in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, who pleaded no contest to the charges, was sentenced last  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a case conference a couple days ago where we took into  
consideration the fact Tyson could appeal the sentencing in 
Maryland,'' Walker said. ``So given that situation, we once again 
have taken a wait-and-see posture for the next couple weeks to see 
if in fact he does appeal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson is on probation in Indiana for raping a beauty pageant  
contestant in an Indianapolis hotel room in 1991. Tyson served 
three years in prison and was released in March 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he does not appeal, then we'll set a hearing here locally  
and move forward on that,'' Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker's words left Robert Greenberg, one of Tyson's Maryland  
lawyers, almost speechless. An hour or so earlier, Greenberg had 
said he was considering two options for Tyson, but that he needed 
``to get a better sense of what will happen in Indiana before any 
decision is made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When told that Indiana would be waiting for him, Greenberg  
appeared surprised. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to comment on that,'' he said. ``I have to take a  
look at this first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The news from Indiana means Greenberg and fellow lawyer Paul  
Kemp will apparently have less information than they hoped as they 
consider their two options: appealing the sentence or asking the 
judge to reconsider it. 
</P>
<P>
	Time is the biggest constraint. Tyson has 90 days to ask Judge  
Stephen Johnson to reconsider his sentence, but only 30 days to 
file an appeal -- which would take the case out of Johnson's 
jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
	An appeal could also result in a jury trial. If convicted, Tyson  
could get a harsher sentence and further increase his chances of 
more punishment in Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Greenberg said he also has concerns over the  
possibility of Tyson resuming his boxing career while serving his 
sentence. The scenario, if there is no appeal and Indiana takes no 
action, would involve Tyson transferring after 60 days to a 
pre-release center, where he could leave during the day to train at 
a gym and return at night. Tyson, with Johnson's permission, could 
also travel out of state to fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenberg said Tyson has received hundreds of letters and gifts,  
including money and food, at the Montgomery County jail, and that 
similar distractions could make it difficult for Tyson to train 
while serving at the less secure pre-release center. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses at Tyson's sentencing hearing testified that the  
fighter had $20 million in debts, mostly to the IRS, and would need 
to fight three or four more times this year to pay them off. 
</P>
<P>
	The prospect of Tyson fighting while an inmate becomes moot if  
Judge Patricia Gifford, who sentenced the fighter for the rape 
conviction in Indiana, takes action that would preclude Tyson's 
transfer to the pre-release center. Walker said he has not 
indicated to the judge whether he thinks Tyson should serve more 
time in Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not my decision. I wouldn't even say it's my  
recommendation,'' he said. ``In fact, I don't know particularly 
right now what my recommendation would be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker said he would make a recommendation only if Gifford  
requests one. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's probation was scheduled to expire in March. If there is  
no appeal and Gifford schedules a probation hearing in 
Indianapolis, the expiration of Tyson's probation would be 
suspended until the matter is settled, Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana authorities also reviewed the probation -- but took no  
action -- after Tyson bit Evander Holyfield's ears during a title 
bout in June 1997. The Nevada Athletic Commission stripped Tyson of 
his boxing license for one year, and reinstated him in October.

<HEADLINE> GOP Pressures INS Commissioner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two House Republicans say they've run out  
patience with INS Commissioner Doris Meissner and want her fired if 
she doesn't act quickly to improve detention and deportation of 
illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, and Rep. Elton Gallegly, R-Calif.,  
sent a five-page letter to Attorney General Janet Reno setting out 
their complaints and asking that Meissner be replaced ``if she is 
unable to quickly address these enforcement problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith called the Immigration and Naturalization Service ``an  
incompetent government agency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had the patience of Job,'' Gallegly said. ``We have  
tried to work with Doris Meissner and we have tried and tried and 
tried again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House said Thursday that Meissner continues to have  
President Clinton's full support and confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Throughout her tenure, Commissioner Meissner has demonstrated  
a firm commitment to strengthening the INS to increased service to 
immigrants and to tough, but compassionate, enforcement of this 
nation's immigration laws,'' White House spokeswoman Amy Weiss 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith and Gallegly said they hoped the letter would kill  
discussion at the INS of possibly releasing up to 1,500 illegal 
aliens convicted of such crimes as burglary, assault and drug 
offenses because of a shortage of detention space. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he was unmoved by reports that INS field managers  
would break their budgets unless they released some detainees to 
make room for offenders with the most serious criminal records. The 
agency's budget has doubled over the last four years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	INS spokesman Russ Bergeron said no criminal aliens had been  
released and no decision had yet been made on whether any would be. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are examining how best to meet the mandatory detention  
requirements of the law in the face of inadequate funding for bed 
space to detain these aliens,'' Bergeron said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallegly and Smith said they also were alarmed over the way the  
agency handled announcements that it would suspend some deportation 
rules for Central American illegal aliens fleeing the devastation 
wrought by Hurricane Mitch. Many Central Americans interpreted the 
announcement as a blanket invitation to come to the United States 
illegally, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a result we are seeing a rising tide of Central American  
attempting to illegally cross out southern border,'' the letter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bergeron said the INS has been working with U.S. embassies  
throughout Central America, U.S. and foreign media and the U.S. 
Information Agency to provide information on who qualifies for the 
more lenient rules and who does not.

<HEADLINE> Stolen Indian Baskets Returned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Three hand-woven Indian baskets stolen from  
the Nevada Historical Society more than 20 years ago and valued at 
nearly $1 million were returned Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The event capped a twisted tale of thievery, dealing and  
negotiating, most of which remains a mystery and may never be 
known. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know who stole them and we really don't know where  
they've been,'' said Peter Bandurraga, the society's director. 
</P>
<P>
	The baskets were made by Washoe Tribe member Dat So La Lee, who  
is believed to have lived from about 1850 to 1925. She made the 
baskets for a Carson City businessman, Abe Cohen, who sold them. 
</P>
<P>
	Dat So La Lee made about 120 baskets in her lifetime, and her  
work became renown for its intricate style and distinctive weave. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nevada Legislature purchased 20 baskets from Cohen's widow  
in 1945 for $1,500. On Nov. 13, 1978, four were stolen from the 
society on the University of Nevada, Reno campus. 
</P>
<P>
	One was recovered two years later, but the whereabouts of the  
other three remained unknown. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the three missing baskets were purchased by Paul  
Shepard, a Tucson art dealer. Shepard brought them to the attention 
of the FBI after an expert on Washoe tribal art identified them as 
the stolen Dat So La Lee baskets. 
</P>
<P>
	J.R. Hill, agent in charge of the FBI office in Reno, said the  
baskets likely changed hands several times over the years, making 
it extremely difficult to track ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepard said he purchased the baskets from another collector,  
Hill said. Nevada eventually paid Shepard $55,000 to get them back. 
</P>
<P>
	Historical Society officials were worried about how the rare and  
delicate baskets made of tule and fern were being stored by the 
FBI. So last February, the FBI agreed to allow the society to store 
them under the appropriate conditions. Each basket was packed in a 
specially made box for the trip from Tucson to Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	With an escort of special agents, historical society officials  
and seats of their own on a commercial airline, the baskets were 
secretly returned and stored in a locker in a climate-controlled 
room at the society's headquarters here. But the FBI kept the key. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the U.S. attorney's office in Arizona decided there  
was insufficient evidence for any prosecutions in the case and 
authorized the FBI to release the baskets. 
</P>
<P>
	The homecoming was completed on Thursday, when Hill and  
Bandurraga, wearing white gloves to protect the baskets from the 
natural acids and oils on their own skin, opened the locker and 
displayed the baskets for the media. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this time we feel a significant responsibility to give  
these baskets back to the people of Nevada,'' Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bandurraga said the baskets will go on permanent exhibit  
sometime this summer, after renovations on the Nevada Historical 
Society's building are complete.

<HEADLINE> Poverty, Income Vary By State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Poverty dropped in every state except Hawaii,  
Idaho and Montana between 1993 and 1995, but poverty rates still 
varied widely across the country -- from 21.4 percent in Mississippi 
to 6.9 percent in New Hampshire, according to new government 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, 13.8 percent of Americans lived in poverty in 1995,  
the Census Bureau says in new figures being released Friday. In 
1995, a family of four was considered poor if its income was below 
$15,569 per year. For a family of three, it was $12,158. 
</P>
<P>
	The estimates also examined median income levels in each of the  
nation's states and counties. Nationally, the typical family earned 
$34,076 in 1995, but that ranged considerably across the nation -- 
from $26,495 in Oklahoma to $44,345 in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	The variations are explained by a variety of factors, including  
the economic conditions in each state, the types of industry 
operating and demographics such as the portion of single-parent 
households, said Gregory Acs, senior research associate at the 
Urban Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Each year, some $20 billion in federal money is allocated based  
on the poverty rates in each county. That includes about $8 billion 
in Title I education dollars to aid schools in serving 
disadvantaged students. 
</P>
<P>
	Because so much rides on these numbers, the Census Bureau  
updates its estimates every few years, rather than waiting for the 
official census every 10 years. This latest update is based on 1995 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
	``Economic conditions can change rapidly,'' the Census Bureau  
said in its summary of the estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	The last report was conducted for 1993, when the economy was not  
as strong. As a result, poverty was higher and incomes were lower. 
Each estimate is based on a three-year average, meaning the 1993 
figures represent the average of 1992-1994, and the 1995 figures 
average 1994-96. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 1993 and 1995, the poverty rate dropped in every state  
except Hawaii, Idaho and Montana, plus the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	And median incomes rose in every state, as would be expected  
because the figures were not adjusted for inflation. Half the 
families have incomes above the median level and half have incomes 
below. 
</P>
<P>
	``The long economic expansion and the very low unemployment  
rates are clearly having a beneficial impact on family incomes, and 
you can see that in the drop in poverty rates, not just nationally 
but in virtually every state,'' Acs said. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Mississippi, two other states -- Louisiana and New Mexico  
-- plus the District of Columbia had poverty rates above 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen others -- largely Southern states -- had poverty rates  
over 15 percent: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Florida, 
Georgia, Kentucky, Montana, New York, Oklahoma, South Carolina, 
Texas and West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides New Hampshire, 12 other states -- mostly in the Northeast  
and Midwest -- had poverty rates below 10 percent: Connecticut, 
Delaware, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, 
Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, Utah and Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Acs notes that living in poverty may be very different in  
different states. There is one poverty level for the nation, but 
some states have much higher costs of living, meaning families that 
are not officially ``poor'' may still be struggling. Similarly, 
poor families living in low-cost areas may be better off than their 
counterparts elsewhere.

<HEADLINE> Ill. Student Shot to Death in Class </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELGIN, Ill. (AP) -- A masked man with a pistol walked into a  
class in an alternative school center and shot a student to death 
Thursday. Another student was slightly injured while scrambling to 
get out of the way. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunman ran away and was not immediately caught. Police  
believe the shooting was gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
	Several students were sitting at computers at the small  
storefront office of Ombudsman Educational Services when the 
suspect, wearing a mask or scarf on his face, opened the door, 
walked toward a 14-year-old boy and fired, hitting him multiple 
times, police said. The boy was pronounced dead in a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Ascough, a school district spokesman, said the boy who  
died had attended ninth grade at Elgin High School but had 
attendance problems and transferred to Ombudsman in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Ombudsman, a private company with 70 educational centers  
nationwide, holds contracts with school districts to tutor at-risk 
high school students, said Lori Sweeney, a co-owner of the 
Libertyville, Ill.-based company.

<HEADLINE> Romney May Head Salt Lake Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Massachusetts venture capitalist Mitt  
Romney is on the verge of taking over as the new head of Salt Lake 
City's scandal-scarred Olympics organizing committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney, the choice of Gov. Mike Leavitt and Salt Lake Organizing  
Committee chairman Robert Garff, met with members of a hastily 
organized selection committee Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	That came just hours after the SLOC ethics committee released  
its report saying bid committee executives engaged in unethical 
conduct in spending more than $1 million to curry favor with 24 
International Olympic Committee members and win the right to host 
the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney met Wednesday with members of the SLOC board, which was  
to be asked today to hire him as president and chief executive 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Also before the organizing committee today was a restructuring  
proposed by Leavitt and Garff. It would expand the board of 
trustees from 33 to 50 and strip it of its decision-making 
authority, making it an advisory board to a new management 
committee of 20. 
</P>
<P>
	One person familiar with the discussion said Frank Joklik, who  
resigned as CEO last month, and board members Spence Eccles, John 
Price, Don Cash and Gerald Sherratt were among those being 
considered for the management committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Joklik and Eccles have been among those criticized for their  
roles in Salt Lake's bid effort, but the ethics panel, while saying 
the bid committee trustees failed to oversee senior management, 
attached no particular blame to the two. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney, 51, a Republican who unsuccessfully challenged Sen. Ted  
Kennedy in 1994, is the son of the late George Romney, governor of 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	He lives in Belmont, Mass., and also has a home in Park City,  
Utah. He graduated from Mormon church-owned Brigham Young 
University in Provo, Utah, and has been a Mormon bishop (lay leader 
of a congregation) and stake president (leader of a group of 
congregations) in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney's Boston company, Bain Capital Inc., specializes in  
buying companies and turning them around. Domino's was a recent 
acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has the perfect business background. He knows how to take  
major businesses in trouble and turn them around,'' said Henry 
Marsh, one of a handful of board trustees asked by Garff on Tuesday 
to peruse applications for the top SLOC job. 
</P>
<P>
	A week ago, Garff conceded a search could be short-circuited if  
a universally approved candidate were found. Romney already was the 
clear choice by then, but Garff and Leavitt have declined to say 
so. 
</P>
<P>
	``We looked at stacks, dozens of resumes,'' Marsh said.  
</P>
<P>
	One businessmen who had been a potential candidate -- Jon  
Huntsman Jr. -- backed out after it became clear there would be no 
real search, he told The Associated Press. Huntsman, vice chairman 
of the $5 billion Huntsman Chemical Corp., said he also rejected 
Leavitt's request that he serve on SLOC's new management committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC ethics report linked an additional 10 IOC members to  
the scandal, bringing to 24 -- a fifth of the total membership -- the 
number of Olympic delegates accused of accepting excessive 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said the ethics report was being forwarded to its own  
six-man panel investigating the Salt Lake City case. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision-making IOC executive board expects to receive ``the  
earliest possible recommendations'' from the panel, the IOC said in 
a statement from Lausanne, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine members have either resigned or been expelled by the IOC  
executive board. Three others remain under investigation, one 
received a warning and one has died. 
</P>
<P>
	Further expulsions are likely before the special IOC assembly in  
Lausanne, March 17-18. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you find something that's a real breach, we basically have  
only one sanction, and that's expulsion,'' said IOC vice president 
Dick Pound, head of the internal inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC executive board delegate Jacques Rogge, a member of Pound's  
panel, said the commission will likely meet soon to review the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said he was not surprised that more members were  
implicated. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said a key issue for the IOC panel will be to determine  
whether members were guilty of actual ethical violations. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to differentiate between what is a breach of the  
line, and what is so-called `lavish treatment,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC marketing director Michael Payne, on a trip to the United  
States to meet with Olympic sponsors, said the IOC is doing 
everything in its power to stamp out corruption and institute 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the head of Olympics sponsor John Hancock insurance  
criticized the IOC's handling of the crisis and suggested that IOC 
president Juan Antonio Samaranch's tenure may be running out. 
</P>
<P>
	But Payne rejected the continuing calls from outside the IOC for  
Samaranch to resign, saying the 78-year-old president is needed to 
lead the house-cleaning efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the president stepped down, you would have a presidential  
election with all the instability that would bring,'' Payne said. 
``That's the last thing you want at this stage. You need a firm 
hand at the top to drive through the changes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite John Hancock's move, Payne said there was no crack in  
support from the Olympic sponsors who pay tens of millions of 
dollars to help finance the games. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sponsors are standing, first of all, behind the games,  
and, second, behind the steps and action the IOC, Samaranch and the 
executive board are taking,'' Payne said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--The IOC promised Wednesday to consider expelling more of them  
to restore its damaged credibility and assuage big-money sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will act decisively,'' said Anita DeFrantz, an IOC vice  
president from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	--Leavitt and US West denied there was a connection between a $5  
million Olympic contribution by the phone company and Leavitt 
pushing telecommunications deregulation. However, Leavitt said he 
was dropping deregulation from proposed legislature to wire Utah 
government and schools for fast Internet service. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Salt Lake bid committee's outside auditors, the accounting  
firm Ernst &AMP; Young, denied the ethics report's allegations that it 
had failed to call attention to undocumented expenditures by 
Olympic bid executives. 
</P>
<P>
	It said that it did identify and discuss undocumented  
expenditures with senior management and the chairman of SLOC's 
audit committee. However, James Beardall, chairman of the audit 
committee, was quoted in a copyright article in The Salt Lake 
Tribune as saying ``I was not made aware of undocumented financial 
expenses.... On the contrary, I was assured by the bid committee's 
auditors that there were no items of special significance not 
previously reported which should be brought to the attention of the 
audit committee or the board of trustees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Australia's Phil Coles, one of the 10 new IOC members  
implicated in the Salt Lake case, stepped down from the Sydney 
Olympic organizing committee board, pending an IOC inquiry. He 
denied the Salt Lake report's allegation that he made four visits 
to the United States at Salt Lake organizers' expense. 
</P>
<P>
	--Barbados IOC member Austin Sealy, implicated in the Salt Lake  
report, denied any wrongdoing. Bid records showed $3,000 a month 
passed through a company affiliated with a consultant to Sealy. 
``The bottom line is that I know nothing about any payments,'' he 
said. ``I'm completely in the dark about this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--The Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter reported that Stockholm's  
unsuccessful bid for the 2004 Olympics paid for the medical care of 
IOC members or their relatives on five occasions. The newspaper 
said each of the payments amounted to more than the $150 limit for 
gifts.

<HEADLINE> New Mexico Forward Walker Returns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- New Mexico forward Damion Walker isn't  
back in New Mexico's starting lineup, but at least he's out of 
coach Dave Bliss' doghouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, suspended last week for breaking team rules, was back in  
uniform for Thursday night's 82-46 victory over San Jose State. 
</P>
<P>
	He got into the game with 2:40 remaining and scored two points,  
had two fouls and one rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, averaging 10.5 points and 4.4 rebounds a game through  
the first 22 games as a starter, did not make New Mexico's trip to 
Hawaii and San Diego State last week. He met the the 25th-ranked 
Lobos on their return to Albuquerque on Tuesday, and the suspension 
was lifted a couple of hours before Thursday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Damion is part of our basketball team again because he  
understands that behavior that is detrimental to the team is not 
what Damion Walker is all about,'' Bliss said after the game. ``He 
made some mistakes, he had some bad judgment and he paid his fine. 
We move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bliss did not let Walker talk to reporters after Thursday's  
game, but made it clear he was pleased the 6-foot-7, 225-pound 
power forward who transferred from Texas Christian was back. 
</P>
<P>
	``Damion Walker has a wonderful heart and we don't pass judgment  
on the sin without considering the heart,'' Bliss said. ``People 
make mistakes, but if the heart is good, we like to think you need 
to be on our team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was Damion's behavior that had to change,'' Bliss said.  
``He just slipped a little bit.''

<HEADLINE> Another Indicted in ASU Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Another alleged gambler in the Arizona State  
University basketball point-shaving scheme was indicted, 
prosecutors said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Joseph Frank, whose age was not immediately available,  
was indicted for conspiracy to commit sports bribery, interstate 
travel in aid of racketeering and sports bribery. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathy Colbert, a spokeswoman for the Arizona U.S. Attorney's  
Office, said the Phoenix man allegedly bribed ASU guard Stevin 
``Hedake'' Smith to fix a game against the University of Washington 
on March 5, 1994. She said he then traveled to Las Vegas to bet on 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, the Sun Devils' No. 2 career scorer, was paid by a  
Chicago bookmaker to fix four games. Colbert said that after fixing 
four games for Chicago bookmaker Benny Silman, Smith figured he 
could make extra money by getting another party to also pay him to 
fix the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Colbert said Smith talked to another ASU student, whose name has  
not been released, and that friend contacted Frank who apparently 
didn't know the game was already being fixed. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank allegedly paid Smith $5,000 to shave points.  
</P>
<P>
	He is the eighth person to be accused in the growing  
point-shaving scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	Silman, the alleged mastermind of the original scheme, is  
serving a 46-month sentence for getting Smith and ASU guard Isaac 
Burton to shave points in certain games so the team wouldn't beat 
the point spread. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith agreed to fix four games for $20,000 a game, in part to  
erase a reported $10,000 gambling debt to Silman, authorities said. 
Burton was paid $4,300 for helping fix two games, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Washington, the other 1994 games in question were  
those with Oregon State on Jan. 27, Oregon on Jan. 29, and Southern 
California on Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, Burton, Phoenix investment adviser Joseph Gagliano Jr.,  
Chicago trucking company executive Dominic Mangiamele and his son, 
Joseph, are awaiting sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, another person was indicted in the scheme.  
</P>
<P>
	Vincent Basso of Buffalo Grove, Ill., was indicted on charges of  
sports bribery, interstate travel in aid of racketeering and 
money-laundering. Prosecutors didn't release his role in the 
scheme.

<HEADLINE> Moon Released by Seahawks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) -- If Warren Moon wants to keep playing  
football, it won't be in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Holmgren, the Seahawks new coach-general manager, announced  
Thursday that the team had released Moon, leaving Jon Kitna as the 
only quarterback on the Seahawks' roster. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to insult him in any way,'' Holmgren said. ``He  
doesn't deserve that. He's been a starter his whole career. Would 
he be real comfortable being a second-team player? It's something I 
had to think about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moon, a nine-time Pro Bowler who will turn 43 next season, had  
said he only wanted to return if he could compete for the starting 
job. Holmgren decided to go with Kitna, who started the final five 
games of last season, and didn't want to pay $5 million to a backup 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just didn't want to create a situation, particularly when  
I'm just starting out new here, that would be the least bit awkward 
or not real positive,'' Holmgren said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not that that would happen necessarily. This way I think it's  
the cleanest way to go where everyone has a chance to try to do 
their thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moon's release, along with those earlier in the week of QB John  
Friesz, DT Dan Saleaumua and RB Steve Broussard, put the Seahawks 
$350,000 under the NFL's salary cap before Friday's deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Moon signed a two-year contract last August after the first  
holdout of his 15-year NFL career. He could still return to Seattle 
with a reduced salary in a backup role. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really enjoyed my two years with the Seahawks and I want to  
thank (owner Paul Allen) for a wonderful opportunity,'' Moon said 
in a statement. ``I remain optimistic that something can be worked 
out at a later date but for now I'm going to consider my options as 
are the Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will, regardless of what happens in the future, maintain a  
strong presence in this community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moon starred at the University of Washington in the 1970s before  
going to the CFL, where he played for six years in Edmonton. He 
moved to the NFL in 1984 when he signed with the Houston Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
	Moon is third in NFL history with 49,097 career passing yards,  
3,972 completions and 6,786 pass attempts. His 290 touchdown passes 
are tied for fourth-best with Johnny Unitas. 
</P>
<P>
	His seven games passing for 400 or more yards is tied for second  
in NFL history with Joe Montana and his 49 games with 300 or more 
passing yards is third best. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Moon's first season with the Seahawks, he set franchise  
records for completions (313) and yards (3,678) and was voted a 
first alternate to the Pro Bowl.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Cancer Drug Enters New Phase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Government scientists have finally managed to  
duplicate a Harvard doctor's success with an experimental cancer 
treatment that wipes out tumors in mice, and they plan to begin 
human testing by the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The closely watched developments involve a natural protein  
called endostatin. It and a sister protein called angiostatin both 
work -- at least in mice -- by blocking tumors' ability to sprout new 
blood vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	This makes cancer fall dormant or disappear altogether in lab  
animals. But no one knows if the same thing will happen in people. 
</P>
<P>
	The two proteins have been the subject of a roller coaster of  
speculation ever since an enthusiastic front-page story in The New 
York Times last May on Dr. Judah Folkman and his experiments. But 
doubts grew last fall when it was reported that scientists from the 
National Cancer Institute in Frederick, Md., had not been able to 
reproduce Folkman's results. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, an NCI team said it had at last duplicated Folkman's  
work. The breakthrough using endostatin came only when the NCI 
scientists conducted the experiments at Folkman's laboratory at 
Children's Hospital in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, another team of NCI researchers said it has begun  
designing endostatin studies in humans. The NCI wants to test the 
drug for safety in perhaps 10 to 30 patients with tumors of the 
breast, kidney, skin or other parts of the body. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are excited about this,'' said Dr. James Pluda, an NCI  
senior drug investigator. ``If all goes well, we hope to begin by 
the third quarter of this year and earlier, if possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pluda said it will take about six months to design the study  
before it can be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration for 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Endostatin and angiostatin are being developed by EntreMed Inc.,  
a small biotech company in Rockville, Md., whose stock price has 
risen and plunged with each bit of news about the drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, it said it is scaling up production of endostatin  
and will have enough for the preliminary human testing proposed by 
the NCI. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent months, NCI scientists in Frederick attempted without  
success to duplicate Folkman's work using endostatin shipped to 
them by his lab. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers assumed that technical problems, including  
possible trouble transporting the fragile protein, messed up their 
experiments. They traveled to Folkman's lab, where last month they 
finally succeeded in using the protein to shrink mouse tumors. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Thursday, the hospital hinted that the problem  
might have involved the proper way to inject mice with endostatin. 
</P>
<P>
	Next, Children's scientists will go to Frederick to help the NCI  
duplicate the experiments there. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one other scientific team has independently published a  
report of similar success with endostatin, and the hospital said 
several others are nearing publication. 
</P>
<P>
	EntreMed is developing endostatin alone. It had a joint venture  
with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. to make angiostatin, but 
Bristol-Myers late Tuesday announced that it is pulling out because 
of difficulty producing reliable quantities of the protein. 
</P>
<P>
	EntreMed's shares lost half their value on Wednesday, but  
bounced back on Thursday. Shares of EntreMed rose $12.81 1/4, or by 
99.5 percent, to $25.68 3/4 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. 
</P>
<P>
	``The timing was pretty good for EntreMed,'' said Carl Gordon,  
an analyst with OrbiMed Advisors. Despite Thursday's hoopla among 
investors, he stressed that destroying cancer cells in people is 
usually much more difficult than defeating cancer in rodents. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCI scientists' success in duplicating Folkman's work was  
first reported by The Boston Globe on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	EntreMed spokeswoman Mary P. Sundeen said the company is  
confident it will be able to develop angiostatin alone. She said 
Entremed hopes to begin human studies of the protein late this 
year.

<HEADLINE> Airline On-Time Performance Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Transportation Department's inspector  
general wants the government revise the procedures it uses for 
gathering statistics to rate the airlines' on-time performances. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report issued Wednesday, inspectors found the 10 major  
airlines reporting departure information use four different methods 
for defining when their planes have ``departed.'' A similar 
inspector general report last year found problems with how airlines 
calculated flight arrival information. 
</P>
<P>
	Airlines regularly use the arrival results in their  
advertisements, and both the departure and arrival information is 
used in reports issued by the Transportation Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``Differences between these methods could result in an aircraft  
being reported as departing on time when another aircraft -- in the 
same situation -- could be reported as departing late,'' wrote 
Lawrence Weintrob, assistant inspector general for auditing. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspection found that airlines use different standards for  
defining ``departure'': releasing an aircraft parking brake, 
rolling an aircraft's wheels, closing the passenger and-or cargo 
doors and closing its doors and releasing the parking brake.

<HEADLINE> Bill Bradley's Ideas Impress Many </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- ``I love him, but I'm for Al Gore,''  
Democratic activist Frankie Farmer sighed after Bill Bradley 
addressed a party gathering in Virginia. She said she thought 
Bradley ``would be a great vice president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Virginia Beach Democrat's comment epitomizes how difficult  
Bradley's job will be to wrest the presidential nomination from 
Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Her reading of Bradley's prospects echoed thoughts voiced by  
some Democrats in Iowa after he made a swing through that state, 
which with next winter's caucuses becomes the first state to choose 
delegates to nominate the party's presidential nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a little late for him to get much traction  
here,'' Des Moines lawyer Jerry Crawford said. ``Iowans are a 
hospitable people. He's a charming guy, and he'll get a good 
reaction. He's been to my house. I'm a big Gore backer, but if 
Bradley asked me to get some friends together to hear him, I 
would.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia Democrats applauded Bradley's keynote speech to their  
Jefferson-Jackson Day dinner last Saturday. In it, he defined the 
party as ``the people who worked hardest to make America a better 
place for everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the hesitance in some voices like Farmer's hinted at the  
challenge facing the former senator from New Jersey in a race for 
the nomination with the vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley is asking Democrats to choose him over the man  
positioned since 1993 as the logical successor to President 
Clinton. Bradley's oratory in Virginia about principled politics 
and compassionate government impressed his listeners but did not 
necessarily sway them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people have a very good feeling about Bill Bradley as  
number one, a person, and number two, a politician; but it has just 
kind of evolved into the heir-apparent thing for Gore,'' said Ann 
Unitas of Arlington, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Of two dozen Democrats interviewed before and after his Richmond  
speech, only a handful gave Bradley more than a long-shot chance to 
capture the nomination. Excited or not about Gore, many accepted 
that he has the inside track in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	A few, like Farmer, pegged him as Gore's pick for vice  
president. 
</P>
<P>
	``Personally, I like him, but I'm going along with experience.  
That's why I'm going with Gore,'' said L.N. Bruce of Richmond, a 
procurement clerk sporting a union-distributed ``Strengthen Social 
Security'' sticker on his tuxedo jacket. ``I would vote for 
Bradley, but I would vote for him as vice (president).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others saw Bradley's role as little more than a sparring partner  
to keep Gore fresh. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think competition brings out the best, and (Bradley) will  
make Al Gore more competitive, more salable, than if he thinks he 
just has it locked up,'' said Basil Gooden, a public health 
researcher from Blacksburg. ``I think Bill Bradley has really 
enhanced the Democrats' chances in 2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State Democratic chairman Ken Plum noted that Bradley said in  
his speech that winning cannot be the only goal. ``What he brings 
to us is vision and ideas,'' Plum said. ``If he's not our nominee, 
at least he helps set the tone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Bradley later insisted he did not mean to suggest he will  
settle for presenting ideas without swaying votes. ``There's only 
one victory -- winning,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some believe he can win.  
</P>
<P>
	J.B. ``Benjy'' Burnett, mayor of Clarksville, said Clinton's  
brush with impeachment will rub off on Gore. ``I wouldn't object to 
us having a fresh face to run,'' he said. ``It's very obvious that 
Gore is going to carry some baggage. We need to wipe the slate 
clean.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Iowa, Keith Hamel called Bradley ``a good man'' and said, ``I  
don't think Gore's got it locked up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a smart guy, and he has a message to deliver, though I  
have doubts about whether he'll have the resources to deliver it,'' 
said Dick Myers, a state representative from Iowa City. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, for his part, is realistic about Gore.  
</P>
<P>
	``Do I think the fact he'll be able to raise millions of dollars  
quickly is an advantage? I sure do,'' he said. ``Do I think having 
all the resources of the federal government at his disposal is an 
advantage? Yes, I do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Neither one of those facts make me feel any differently about  
how I'm going to run this campaign,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Las Vegas Mayor Won't Run Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Mayor Jan Jones, who twice made unsuccessful  
bids for governor, is calling it quits after guiding the city 
through eight years of unprecedented growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think right now it's time to take a step back and  
reflect,'' Jones said Thursday in announcing she would not seek a 
third four-year term in this spring's city elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who withdrew as a candidate in December for a top post  
with the Democratic National Committee, said she did not know what 
she would do next. ``I'm not ruling anything out. I'll still be 
around,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 49, the first female mayor of Las Vegas, won her two  
mayoral elections by landslides, then interrupted both terms with 
two unsuccessful bids for governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was diagnosed with breast cancer in January 1998 and had a  
lumpectomy shortly after that to remove the malignant growth. She 
underwent radiation and announced in August that she had won her 
battle with breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones has been called an effective spokeswoman for Las Vegas,  
raising the city's profile as it transformed into the 
fastest-growing area in the country.

<HEADLINE> Kwan Gets Inspiration From Within </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- With no Tara Lipinski and no Nicole Bobek  
to push her, Michelle Kwan has gotten her inspiration from within 
as she seeks a third U.S. Figure Skating Championships title. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan, also a two-time world champion and Olympic silver  
medalist, is -- by far -- the most accomplished women's skater in the 
world. While she might get a push from several Russians at next 
month's world championships, there isn't anyone in this week's 
field likely to challenge the 18-year-old star. 
</P>
<P>
	There might have been if Olympic champion Lipinski hadn't turned  
pro shortly after the Nagano Games. Or if Bobek, the 1995 U.S. 
champion, had been healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Kwan appears to have something akin to a walkover  
heading into Thursday night's short program, worth one-third of the 
total score. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never think about being No. 1 and skating against anyone,''  
Kwan said. ``I've always been a competitor who always skates for 
the fun of it. I don't go out there and think I'm untouchable. I 
never think that way, because you never know. Tara was a skater 
that no one ever heard of and she won. So it could be anybody 
next.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lipinski, however, was in a different class from Angela  
Nikodinov, Amber Corwin, Brittney McConn and Sarah Hughes. She had 
a track record that exceeded any resume this year's skaters own -- 
and a ton of talent, too. 
</P>
<P>
	So Kwan is wise to concentrate on herself and her skating and to  
ignore such issues as world domination and sticking around for the 
2002 Olympics, which she has said is in her plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``How am I going to do it for another three years?'' she asked,  
giggling. ``That's what I've been asking myself. It's just ... not 
worrying about the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That means upgrading what already is a very impressive  
repertoire, including practicing several triple jump combinations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've worked a lot on speed between jumps, the spins -- not  
spinning just because it is required -- and the little things that 
matter,'' Kwan said. ``But for me, it's the pleasure of skating. 
That's what it comes down to. Skating. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I stop loving to skate, that's when it's time to walk  
away.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLEROI, Pa. (AP) -- Mitchell Paige had a few conditions before  
he let a toy maker put his face on G.I. Joe: Make him look like a 
Marine and put a machine gun in his hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasbro got it mostly right.  
</P>
<P>
	``I never had hair that red!'' the retired U.S. Marine colonel  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The action figure of the World War II veteran is one in Hasbro's  
``Classic Collection'' of Medal of Honor recipients. The model was 
released in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Paige, now 81, won the Medal of Honor in 1943 for keeping  
Japanese troops from taking a landing strip in Guadalcanal in the 
Solomon Islands. In the four-month battle, the platoon of 48 
Marines he commanded dwindled until he was the last man left. 
</P>
<P>
	He single-handedly held the line for four hours as  
reinforcements arrived, then led them to push the Japanese back. 
Americans secured the island a month later. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Hartglass, Hasbro's team leader for G.I. Joe product  
development, said the company wanted dolls modeled after real-life 
heroes who ``encompassed the Joe essence of honor, courage and 
valor.'' He said Paige fit the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``His story is pretty compelling,'' Hartglass said. ``It's  
something out of a movie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $37 limited-edition dolls sold out by the end of December.  
Hasbro may release a second wave next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Paige was skeptical at first, but his wife talked him into it.  
</P>
<P>
	``How many children have a doll of their grandpa?'' she said.  
``A lot of younger generations don't even know that Guadalcanal 
even happened. I felt this might cause them to look back and find 
out a little bit about the past.''

<HEADLINE> Marion Jones Wants FloJo's Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When Marion Jones was 5, she was lying on the  
living room floor and watching Diane marry Prince Charles on 
television. She turned to her mother and brother and said, ``They 
have a red carpet to walk on because they're special people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marion Jones, now 23, is one of those special people.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, she was ranked No. 1 in the world in the 100 meters,  
200 meters and the long jump -- the first American to be ranked at 
the top in three events in the same year. She won all three of her 
events at the USA Championships, the first to accomplish the feat 
in 50 years. She was voted the world's outstanding female athlete 
by the International Amateur Athletic Federation, the world 
governing body for track and field, and she was chosen the sport's 
top female athlete by USA Track &AMP; Field, the national governing 
body. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, she received the coveted Jesse Owens International  
Trophy Award as the world's outstanding amateur athlete -- male or 
female -- for 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	With her name now linked to Owens, winner of four gold medals at  
the 1936 Olympics and one of the greatest athletes in track and 
field history, Jones wants to surpass the feats of the late 
Florence Griffith Joyner, perhaps the best women's sprinter ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sit and think about being mentioned in the same breath as  
Florence and Jesse Owens,'' Jones said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the mercurial Jones became the No. 2 women's sprinter  
ever, behind Griffith Joyner. FloJo holds world records in the 100 
(10.49 seconds) and 200 (21.34), both set in 1988, when she won 
three Olympic gold medals (in the 100, 200 and 400 relay) and one 
silver medal (in the 1,600 relay). 
</P>
<P>
	Jones' best times were 10.65 and 21.62, both at the  
season-ending World Cup in Johannesburg, South Africa, where she 
also lost her only event of the year in 37 competitions, finishing 
second in the long jump to Germany's Heike Drechsler. Nevertheless, 
Jones was the world leader in the long jump last year, twice 
leaping 23 feet, 11 3/4 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	That was only the second full year of track and field  
competition for Jones, who had concentrated on basketball while at 
North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came out of college fresh,'' she said, noting that many  
athletes who compete in age-group, high school and college 
competition are worn out by the time they complete that series. ``I 
was excited to show people what I could do. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, I plan to be in track and field for as long it takes to  
go after Florence's records and golds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Jones plans to go for gold medals in the 100, 200,  
long jump and 1,600 relay in the World Outdoor Championships at 
Seville, Spain, in August. Next year, her goal is five golds (in 
the 100, 200, long jump, 400 relay and 1,600 relay) at the Sydney 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Five golds is not just talk,'' she said. ``It's possible. If  
any athlete can do it, it's myself. I was born with a lot of 
talent, but I'm also a very hard worker. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love to win, I love to be on top, I love the feeling of  
crossing the finish line first, about five of six meters ahead of 
everyone else. It's good to be considered one of the greatest ever. 
It's not going to happen overnight. It will take a lot of hard 
work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith Joyner's husband, Al Joyner, thinks Jones is capable of  
breaking not only his wife's two world records but also the long 
jump mark of 24-8 1/4, by Galina Chistyakova of Russia in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think she will jump at least 25 feet,'' said Joyner, whose  
wife also was honored at the Owens dinner honoring Jones Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Joyner said Jones still hasn't learned to maximize her speed on  
the track or on the long jump runway and is far from a polished 
technician in the long jump. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once she maximizes her speed and her power, she'll be  
unbelievable,'' he said. ``Once she masters her speed on the board, 
she'll go into orbit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joyner also is impressed with Jones' confidence. Other  
sprinters, he said, haven't come close to the records because they 
think the marks are invincible. 
</P>
<P>
	``Marion has not said the records are impossible,'' Joyner said.  
``She has a great attitude. She has the goal of being the best and 
she enjoys the challenge. She'll be No. 1.''

<HEADLINE> Senator Hatch Questions Starr Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Orrin Hatch is questioning whether the  
Justice Department can conduct an unbiased probe of possible 
misconduct by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, also  
complained Thursday that the timing of recent news leaks about 
whether Starr overstepped his bounds in the early days of the 
Monica Lewinsky investigation smacks of partisanship. 
</P>
<P>
	``The articles appeared in the press while the Senate was  
conducting final deliberations on the articles of impeachment 
against President Clinton,'' Hatch, R-Utah, wrote in a letter to 
Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder. 
</P>
<P>
	``The timing of these articles could not be more suspicious,''  
Hatch wrote, warning Holder to be ready to answer questions about 
the matter at a previously scheduled meeting with him today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will provide whatever information is appropriate at the  
meeting,'' Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meeting with reporters earlier Thursday, Attorney General Janet  
Reno would not comment directly on news reports that the Justice 
Department would investigate Starr's office. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lewinsky investigation led to Clinton's impeachment by the  
House and the Senate trial for alleged perjury and obstruction of 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch, a frequent critic of Reno's handling of independent  
counsel matters, contended the leaks apparently came from the 
Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``These press accounts once again call into question the  
department's integrity and support the impression many people have 
that this is a partisan Justice Department,'' Hatch wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno angered Hatch by refusing to seek independent counsels to  
investigate 1996 campaign fund-raising issues related to Clinton, 
Vice President Al Gore and former White House aide Harold Ickes. 
Hatch recently called her department the most partisan Justice 
Department this century. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Reno had no immediate comment on the Hatch  
letter. But Reno herself, asked about earlier criticism from Hatch, 
denied she had taken sides as Starr pursued a variety of 
allegations against the Clinton White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a great respect for Senator Hatch,'' Reno said at her  
weekly press conference. ``And I think if he looked at the record, 
he would see that I've been damned by both sides and will continue 
to try to call it like I see it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several news organizations, including The Associated Press,  
reported this week that the Justice Department has advised Starr it 
intends to investigate actions of his office, including its Jan. 
16, 1998, offer to Ms. Lewinsky of an immunity deal on condition 
she not discuss it with her lawyer, Frank Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	A conservative legal group inserted itself into the issue  
Thursday. The Landmark Legal Foundation filed a request that the 
special three-judge panel overseeing Starr's work block any Justice 
Department investigation of the prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	``This initiative by the attorney general -- the president's  
appointee -- is clearly calculated to undermine the independent 
counsel's investigation at a critical stage,'' the group claimed in 
court papers.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Freezes Forest Road Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration imposed a freeze on  
road building in 33 million acres of federal forests Thursday, 
although it exempted vast areas including most of the Northwest and 
the largest federal forest in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-month moratorium was a prelude to a much broader forest  
road management plan to be developed next year that is aimed at 
protecting the entire 191 million-acre federal forest system from 
unnecessary and damaging road construction. 
</P>
<P>
	The construction ban immediately brought sharp criticism from  
the timber industry which said it will impede healthy forest 
management. Some environmentalists called it a positive step, but 
others complained too many forests were exempted from the freeze. 
</P>
<P>
	The 33 million acres singled out by the U.S. Forest Service for  
the moratorium is spread across the country from the Southern 
Appalachians to the Chugach National Forest in Alaska. It includes 
areas in some cases as small as 1,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are calling an official time out, so we can examine the  
science, involve the public and build a road policy for the 21st 
century,'' Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said at a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials estimated that moratorium would prevent construction  
of about 360 miles of road and prevent the harvesting of 170 
million to 260 million board feet of timber, less than 4 percent of 
annual timber harvests, during the 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
	W. Henson Moore, president of the American Forest and Paper  
Association, called the ban ``a disaster for those who are 
committed to the health of our nation's forests'' He said it will 
result in forests ``filled with dead or dying trees. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not about timber. The bigger issue is access to the  
forests for any reason,'' said Moore in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban brought mixed reaction from environmentalists.  
</P>
<P>
	Some praised the move as a step toward greater protection under  
the-yet-to-be-developed forest management plan. Others complained 
of the vast areas of roadless forests -- between 15 million and 20 
million acres -- that are exempted from the freeze. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ultimately this policy should lead us to permanent protection  
of all 60 million acres'' of roadless federal forests, said William 
Meadows, president of the Wilderness Society. He called it a move 
``in the right direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Sierra Club said the plan was ``full of loopholes'' and  
the Heritage Forests Campaign, a coalition of environmental groups, 
said the moratorium ``misses the target'' by failing to 
specifically ban logging and mineral development in the roadless 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The moratorium had been expected and largely mirrored a draft  
proposal unveiled a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Forest Service manages 191 million acres of forests and  
more than 400,000 miles of forest roads, many of which have been 
deteriorating because of increased recreational uses and lack of 
money for maintenance. This year the service received $99 million 
for forest road maintenance, less than a fifth of what the agency 
considers necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	The Forest Service ban exempts most of the old growth federal  
forests in the Northwest that were the focus of a management plan 
to protect the spotted owl. And it does not cover the 16.7 million 
acre Tongass forest in Alaska, the largest federal forest. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Dombeck, head of the U.S. Forest Service, said these  
forests were not included because they already have management 
plans that will adequately protect the roadless areas over the next 
18 months until a permanent, long-term strategy is developed.

<HEADLINE> Colts Moving Training Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Indianapolis Colts are moving their  
training camp after 15 years of workouts at Anderson University. 
</P>
<P>
	Club president Bill Polian said Thursday that Anderson is not  
one of the final sites he is considering for the team's training 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting closer to the decision,'' Polian said. ``My  
marching orders are to stay in state, if possible. We're probably 
down to three possibilities at this point with two of them very 
real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said at least one of the finalists is a location outside  
Indiana, but did not identify the sites being considered. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colts have had discussions with officials at Rose-Hulman in  
Terre Haute, Earlham in Richmond, DePauw in Greencastle and St. 
Francis in Fort Wayne about locating their training camp on their 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose-Hulman could be the front-runner in Indiana.  
</P>
<P>
	The school recently opened a $20 million multi-use indoor  
Athletics and Recreation Center that offers a new swimming pool, 
state-of-the-art fitness facilities and locker rooms. Rose-Hulman 
also has upgraded football and track facilities and an indoor track 
facility that could be used during bad weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Polian has declined to identify which cities he was considering.  
A story in The Courier-Journal in Louisville last year said 
officials from the city and the University of Louisville were 
considering an attempt to lure the Colts to Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	Another possibility would be the University of Wisconsin-Stevens  
Point, where the Jacksonville Jaguars have been training. The 
Jaguars set up training camp at their headquarters in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Three other NFL teams held their training camps in Wisconsin  
last year. New Orleans was stationed in LaCrosse, Kansas City in 
River Falls and Chicago in Platteville.

	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- A riverboat capsized in a river in  
northern Brazil, killing at least six people, officials said 
Thursday. Another 40 people disappeared and were feared dead. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident occurred late Wednesday near Manicore, 1,550 miles  
northwest of Sao Paulo, in the jungle state of Amazonas. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Col. Nilson Pereira da Silva, commander of the Amazonas  
State Fire Department, said it appeared the boat was carrying far 
more weight than it should have been. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the boat was carrying 150 passengers when it probably  
hit a sandbar or smashed into a fallen tree. 
</P>

	Divers recovered six bodies and were searching for at least 40  
people in the Madeira River, he said. Passengers on a passing boat

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The Mexican government has asked that the  
brother of former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari be 
transferred from a maximum-security prison to a Mexico City jail, 
local media reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Raul Salinas, sentenced last month to 50 years for masterminding  
the murder of a political rival, has been imprisoned since 1995 in 
Almoloya de Juarez, a prison 35 miles west of Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
	Local media reported that the Interior Ministry, which oversees  
national security, had requested the transfer. An Interior Ministry 
spokesman declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Almoloya de Juarez was built during President Salinas' 1988-94  
term to hold the country's most dangerous criminals. It is infamous 
for its intrusive security measures and strict limitations on

<P>
	The Popular Revolutionary Army, which rose in arms in 1996  
seeking government reform, warned in a release that the alleged 
fraud could lead to an armed struggle.

	Democratic Revolution leaders have charged the ruling party,  
known as the PRI, bought votes in impoverished mountain 
communities, stuffed ballot boxes and altered ballots. The PRI has 
denied any wrongdoing.

	``The economy is prostrate,'' Armando Montenegro, head of the  
Association of Financial Institutions, told a conference on the

	``If there is no withdrawal, there is no dialogue,'' Nicolas  
Rodriguez, the top commander of the 5,000-member National 
Liberation Army told the Radionet network. The Cuban-inspired rebel 
group has fought the government since the 1960s.

	MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- The Nicaraguan government has begun  
building 100 new houses for families left homeless by Hurricane 
Mitch. 
</P>
<P>
	The government plans to build about 240 houses in all -- at a  
cost of $1,750 each -- in the town of Posoltega, 120 miles northwest 
of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	The town gave shelter to victims of a devastating mudslide at  
the nearby Casitas Volcano that killed more than 2,000 people and 
left hundreds homeless.

<HEADLINE> Q &AMP; A on Listeria Monocytogenes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Some common questions about listeria monocytogenes and answers  
provided by the Agriculture Department's Food Safety and Inspection 
Service: 
</P>
<P>
	Q: What are listeria monocytogenes and listeriosis?  
</P>
<P>
	A: Listeria monocytogenes is a bacteria often found in soil and  
water. Illness from eating foods with the bacteria is called 
listeriosis. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Who is at risk?  
</P>
<P>
	A: Pregnant women and newborns, older adults and people with  
weakened immune systems. Fewer than 2,000 people in the United 
States report serious illness from listeriosis each year and about 
a quarter of those die from the illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: How do you know if you might have listeriosis?  
</P>
<P>
	A: Listeriosis has flu-like symptoms, such as fever and chills.  
Sometimes people have an upset stomach. If the infection spreads to 
the nervous system, symptoms such as headache, stiff neck, 
confusion, loss of balance, or convulsions can occur. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: What if you are pregnant?  
</P>
<P>
	A: While pregnant women may experience only mild, flu-like  
illness, the mother's illness can be transmitted to the fetus 
through the placenta. This can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, or 
serious health problems for her newborn child. Of the 16 deaths 
reported in a recent outbreak, five were stillbirths or 
miscarriages. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: How long does it take to get sick?  
</P>
<P>
	A: It can take up to eight weeks for someone to become ill. If  
you are at risk or have symptoms that concern you, consult a 
physician. Listeriosis is successfully treated with antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: What if I want to know more?  
</P>
<P>
	A: Contact the USDA's Meat and Poultry Hotline: 1 800 535-4555.  
On the Web, check the Food Safety and Inspection Service at 
www.fsis.usda.gov or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

<HEADLINE> Gore Letter Warns of GOP Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeking contributions for his White House bid,  
Vice President Al Gore is asking supporters to help him move 
politics ``upward'' and away from personal attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first direct mailing to potential contributors, Gore  
warns against letting the nation ``succumb to the forces of 
divisiveness, extremism and personal destruction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two-page letter signed by Gore invites recipients to join a  
national steering committee and send contributions to build early 
support for his bid to succeed President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Republican candidates have already begun their attacks on me  
... and they will only intensify,'' Gore wrote. ``Will you stand 
with me as I face down these personal attacks?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter, dated Feb. 8, was sent to anyone who ever has  
contributed to the Clinton-Gore campaigns, well more than 100,000 
people, according to a source familiar with Gore's fund-raising 
operation. The vice president also has several fund-raising events 
on his schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Gore adviser, the appeal is aimed at Democratic  
voters enraged by the impeachment of Clinton because of the 
president's efforts to conceal his affair with a White House 
intern. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic Party and its committees have reported dramatic  
increases in donations since they began citing in their 
fund-raising appeals GOP efforts to oust Clinton from office over 
the Monica Lewinsky issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has been loyal to Clinton throughout, which has endeared  
him to the Democratic base, especially minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first election of the 21st century will be a defining  
moment in our history,'' the vice president wrote. ``It is 
imperative that we win this race. Your support is the key.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our citizens are tired of the politics of personal attack, and  
we must transcend these destructive trends. We must not only move 
politics forward, but also upward, to a higher place,'' the letter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter touts strides made by Clinton and Gore since their  
1992 election, from low unemployment rates to a balanced budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president also highlighted goals for the future: making  
health care available to all, combating climate change and 
improving education. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore cautioned supporters, ``This will not be an easy race.''  
</P>
<P>
	The only other current candidate for the Democratic presidential  
nomination is former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley. Sen. John Kerry, 
D-Mass., and civil rights activists Jesse Jackson may yet join the 
race.

<HEADLINE> Bucks Coach Karl To Make Home Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. FRANCIS, Wis. (AP) -- George Karl, who makes his home debut  
as coach of the Milwaukee Bucks tonight, might have been 
broadcasting the game if not for the twists and turns of ankles and 
luck. 
</P>
<P>
	Terrell Brandon, Glenn Robinson and Tyrone Hill missed most of  
last season's stretch run with injuries, costing the Bucks a 
playoff run and coach Chris Ford his job. 
</P>
<P>
	Karl, fired in Seattle after another playoff run ended without a  
ring, was close to taking a television analyst job before Sen. Herb 
Kohl, the owner of the Bucks, waved $20 million in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
	Karl decided not to hold out for a glamour job. After all, he  
saw a promising upside to the Bucks, who haven't made the playoffs 
in seven seasons. Now they have begun this lockout-shortened season 
with victories at Charlotte and Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they would have had an average March, they probably would  
have been a playoff team last year,'' Karl said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Bucks, who finished 36-46, lost Brandon, Robinson and  
Hill for more than 70 combined games. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Allen, who signed a six-year, $70.9 million contract  
extension Wednesday, was the only starter not to miss any time last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Injuries kind of killed us last year,'' Robinson said. ``We  
know we have a better team that what we played like last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hill said the Bucks are more resolute for 1999 than most teams.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're a lot more eager because the last month, April  
and part of March, we didn't play much,'' Hill said. ``Terrell and 
Glenn and I, we talked about it, you know, `Let's get this going, 
let's try to stay healthy.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Brandon missed 32 games with a sprained ankle. Robinson, who  
never missed a game in his first four seasons, sat out 26 games 
with a leg injury, and Hill missed 25 games due to injuries and a 
family illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Could they have returned to the lineup to help make a playoff  
push? 
</P>
<P>
	Karl doesn't care.  
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, I've heard a lot of stories about a lot of these guys  
and I told them in my first meeting with them, `I'm not making any 
judgments on you,' '' Karl said. ``There's a lot of things about 
George Karl that have been written that aren't true ... I don't 
think there's a need for me to look at what happened last year 
through other peoples' eyes because I wasn't here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brandon, who made 10 trips to Hawaii during the offseason to run  
in the sand and strengthen his ankles, said he doesn't understand 
why fans accused him of dogging it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't have had a cast on if it was just a regular  
sprained ankle,'' Brandon said. ``I was in a cast for three weeks 
and it seems like no one ever really saw that or understood what 
that meant. You just can't come out of the cast and start playing 
right away. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to rehab and get your conditioning back. It had  
nothing to do with Milwaukee or Chris Ford, he was a nice guy. Or 
anything else. It was just a matter of I couldn't plant, my lateral 
movement was slow. I couldn't move,'' Brandon said. ``Now I'm 
healthy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So are Robinson and Hill.  
</P>
<P>
	Brandon said having his health back has invigorated his spirit.  
</P>
<P>
	``For my ankle to really feel good, that is a plus for me and  
it's a plus for our ball club,'' he said. ``I'm excited about being 
healthy and not just basketball, but just waking up every day and 
not having to feel pain, that feels good.''

<HEADLINE> MCI WorldCom Revenue Quadruples </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- MCI WorldCom posted strong profits in the  
final months of 1998, quadrupling its revenues in the first full 
quarter since WorldCom acquired MCI to form the nation's No. 2 
long-distance company. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported Thursday that it earned $442 million, or 23  
cents per share, in the fourth quarter, edging past most Wall 
Street forecasts. The results include a $14 million profit from a 
minority stake bought last summer in the Brazilian telephone 
company Embratel Participacoes. 
</P>
<P>
	In the fourth quarter of 1997, when WorldCom and MCI  
Communications had not yet merged, the companies posted a combined 
loss of $313 million, or 18 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom, formed by a $43 billion merger that close in  
mid-September, saw its fourth-quarter revenues rise to $9.02 
billion, up from $2.02 billion in the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues from communications services, including voice, data,  
and Internet operations, improved 17 percent in the latest quarter, 
rising from $6.5 billion a year earlier to $7.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In midday trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market, MCI WorldCom's  
shares were up $3.75 a share at $80. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong quarterly report came as MCI WorldCom announced a  
deal to sell its computer services unit to Electronic Data Systems 
Corp. for $1.67 billion as part of a broader deal under which 
13,000 employees will switch companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have intensified our focus on what we do best -- provide  
core communications services. Including today's announcement with 
EDS, over the past year we have shed virtually all of our 
non-communications services businesses,'' said Bernard J. Ebbers, 
president and chief executive officer of MCI WorldCom. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, merger-related expenses and other one-time  
costs pushed the company to a loss of $2.7 billion, or $2.12 per 
share. Excluding those one-time costs, the company earned $1.07 
billion, or $0.81 per share in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Those results compare with a combined 1997 loss of $308 million,  
or 18 cents per share, for WorldCom and MCI. 
</P>
<P>
	Full-year revenues totaled $30.4 billion in 1998, up 15 percent  
from $26.5 billion in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Says Teamsters Witness Led </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A key witness in the federal investigation  
into the Teamsters lied to government attorneys after he cut a deal 
to cooperate with them, according to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to defense attorneys for former union officials and  
to court-appointed officers monitoring the union, the prosecutors 
said the witness, Jere Nash, had ``falsely denied any role'' in a 
scheme to defraud the union through improper billings. 
</P>
<P>
	The billings scheme apparently was only tangential to the  
election scandal that led to the ouster of union president Ron 
Carey and the federal indictment of the union's former political 
director, William Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
	Nash was Carey's campaign manager and a key witness against him  
before the court-appointed board that removed him from office. The 
government's case against Hamilton also rests in large part on 
conversations he allegedly had with Nash about political donations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nash acknowleged that, when previously questioned by the  
government regarding these expenses, he intentionally withheld 
information about the scheme, and falsely denied any role in the 
billing of expenses,'' according to the Feb. 5 letter from U.S. 
Attorney Mary Jo White. The letter was obtained Thursday by The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Carey's 1996 re-election over James P. Hoffa was overturned  
after investigators found that his campaign had improperly 
benefitted from donations the union made to third-party political 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Nash, political consultant Martin Davis and telemarketer Michael  
Ansara all pled guilty to the scheme in 1997. Nash implicated Carey 
before the court-appointed review board, and both he and Davis 
alleged that Hamilton participated. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton is fighting the charges, and Carey has an appeal  
pending in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	The new allegations involve more than $21,000 in campaign  
expenses that Nash and Davis improperly billed to the union. 
</P>
<P>
	Nash apparently admitted his role in the scheme earlier this  
month, after denying it for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am bringing this to your attention in connection with your  
pending appeals of Mr. Carey's and Mr. Hamilton's discipline by the 
Independent Review Board,'' White wrote.

<HEADLINE> 49ers' Detmer May Be Sent to Browns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- San Francisco quarterback Ty Detmer,  
who backed up Steve Young last season, could be on his way to 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	League rules prevent a trade from being formalized until Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	However, the 49ers and Browns have talked about a possible deal  
involving Detmer, who was signed by San Francisco before last 
season as a free agent after two years as a starter for 
Philadelphia. He also spent four years in Green Bay as Brett 
Favre's understudy. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland, looking to stock its new team with players, would  
give the 49ers draft picks in exchange for Detmer. Other San 
Francisco players that could be included in the swap are defensive 
end Roy Barker and tight end Irv Smith, according to unidentified 
sources cited by the Oakland Tribune and Contra Costa Times on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In his only start last season, Detmer offset three interceptions  
by throwing for three scores in San Francisco's 25-23 win over 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers are in need of draft picks after last April's trade  
with Denver in which they sent their 1999 second-round selection to 
Denver in exchange for tackle Jamie Brown, who proved to be a bust 
and was released earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco also is trying to slash its bloated player  
payroll. Teams must be in compliance with the cap by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The expansion Browns are believed to want Detmer, a seven-year  
pro, as a potential starter while a young quarterback, perhaps 
rookie Tim Couch, is groomed for the job. Cleveland is considering 
taking Couch, a star at Kentucky, with the first pick in the NFL 
draft.

<HEADLINE> Smoker Awarded $51.5 Million in Damages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- When Patricia Henley was 15, she watched  
sultry star Susan Hayward smoke on the big screen. It was cool. It 
was glamorous. She said no one told her it might be deadly. 
</P>
<P>
	Three decades later, the former three-pack-a-day smoker with  
inoperable lung cancer convinced a jury that Philip Morris Cos. 
concealed the risks and addictiveness of smoking, and the panel 
rewarded her by returning the largest verdict ever in a tobacco 
lawsuit filed by an individual -- $51.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel wonderful,'' said Ms. Henley, who pledged to donate any  
money she receives to educate youngsters about the dangers of 
smoking. ``This is a great day for the children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Henley, 52, won $50 million in punitive damages Wednesday on  
top of $1.5 million in compensation awarded by the Superior Court 
jury a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Although no similar verdict against the tobacco industry has  
survived on appeal, some say Ms. Henley's case marks a change in 
fortune for cigarette makers. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Stanton Glantz, a University of California, San Francisco  
professor of medicine who published a book in 1996 that exposed 
tobacco industry documents, said he believes plaintiffs' lawyers 
have learned from mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you're just beginning to see the beginning of the dam  
burst,'' he said. ``The evidence of wrongdoing by the industry is 
getting overwhelming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Henley thought she had pneumonia when she started coughing  
and having trouble singing. She was about to record a country and 
western music compact disc when she finally sought help. 
</P>
<P>
	She was diagnosed a year ago with inoperable cancer. Ms. Henley  
was forced to quit smoking and educate herself about what was in 
all those Marlboros. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went from knowing nothing to knowing too much,'' she said.  
``We went into this case figuring we'd never beat big business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She sued Philip Morris in May.  
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer, Madelyn Chaber, asked a jury of five men and seven  
women to ``send a message back to this company that the price of 
human life cannot be calculated into the cost of doing business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Punitive damages were the only way to get the attention of a  
company worth $3.5 billion, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the 12 jurors, including jury foreman George Loudis,  
voted against awarding the $50 million in punitive damages. He 
supported punitive damages of $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our decision was based on a lot of evidence, the suppression  
of known facts by Philip Morris,'' Loudis said. ``They had a lot of 
information they just didn't give out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Ohlemeyer, who represents Philip Morris, said Wednesday  
that the company would appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The jurors unfortunately let their feelings of sympathy get in  
the way,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is California's first since the repeal of a 1987 state  
law that banned lawsuits by cigarette smokers on the basis that the 
risks of smoking were well known. Dozens of cases pending at the 
time were dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, then-state Attorney General Dan Lungren joined justice  
officials in other states in suing the tobacco industry, and the 
state Legislature repealed the ban on individual lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	The tobacco industry reached a $206 billion legal settlement  
with states in November, but cigarette makers still face individual 
and class-action claims. 
</P>
<P>
	However, jury awards in such cases are rare. Two verdicts in  
Florida and one in New Jersey against cigarette makers were all 
overturned by appeals courts. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Ms. Henley's lung cancer is in remission, she said it's  
not likely she'll live to see her granddaughters, ages 2 and 10, 
grow up. 
</P>
<P>
	``My battle's over. It's just a matter of time,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Hostages Released From Miss. School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PURVIS, Miss. (AP) -- A man with a history of mental problems  
took four people hostage Thursday at a school for troubled 
students, demanding that more black teachers be hired. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell Martin, 47, let the last of the hostages go late  
Thursday evening and surrendered to authorities at the Jefferson 
Todd Educational Center after a 12-hour standoff. The three who 
were released earlier in the day said Martin had a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin walked into a school office in the morning, paced around  
and threw a telephone against the wall before taking hostages, all 
of whom were women. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives said Martin has been in and out of hospitals and is on  
medication for mental problems. They said he is a friendly man who 
never exhibited violent behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	WDAM-TV said Martin called the station on Tuesday angry about  
the lack of black teachers. He made similar complaints a day 
earlier to a weekly newspaper in Purvis, a town of just more than 
2,000 residents about 92 miles southeast of Jackson.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Ailing Banks To Get $66B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The Japanese government will inject public funds  
worth almost $66 billion into 15 major banks as part of efforts to 
shore up the debt-ridden financial system, newspapers reported 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The government passed legislation last October allowing the use  
of taxpayers' money to bail out weak Japanese banks or help 
replenish capital reserves at healthier ones. 
</P>
<P>
	The Financial Restructuring Committee will formally notify the  
15 banks on Friday that their requests for public funds have been 
approved, major dailies including the Yomiuri Shimbun and the Asahi 
Shimbun reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The banks will receive the funds by the end of March, the  
reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan is mired in its worst recession since World War II, as  
debt-ridden banks scale back on lending, starving companies of 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Many finance institutions are now struggling to write off  
massive bad loans left over from the collapse of Japan's ``bubble'' 
economy in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee has asked the banks to carry out drastic  
restructuring, and some banks have reportedly been urged to 
restrict their activities to the domestic market. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 15 banks, Fuji Bank Ltd. will get the largest amount  
of $8.85 billion, followed by Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. with an 
injection of $7.96 billion, the newspapers said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Money Funds Mixed in Latest Week / Money Market Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Assets of the nation's retail money market  
mutual funds increased by $3.94 billion to $858.37 billion in the 
latest week, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of taxable money market funds in the retail category rose  
by $4.02 billion to $705.81 billion for the week ended Wednesday, 
the Washington-based mutual fund trade group said. Tax-exempt fund 
assets decreased by $80.4 million to $152.56 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of institutional money market funds decreased by $3.36  
billion to $592.96 billion for the same period. Among institutional 
funds, taxable money market fund assets decreased by $2.97 billion 
to $542.29 billion; assets of tax-exempt funds decreased by $390.0 
million to $50.67 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Total money market assets stood at $1.451 trillion for the week.  
</P>
<P>
	Assets for the previous week were revised to $1.451 trillion to  
reflect reporting errors and a change in the number of funds 
reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell to  
4.37 percent in the week ended Tuesday from 4.41 percent in the 
previous week, said IBC's Money Fund Report, a trade journal 
published in Ashland, Mass., by IBC Financial Data Inc. The 30-day 
average yield fell to 4.42 percent from 4.44 percent, IBC Financial 
Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day compounded yield fell to 4.47 percent from 4.51  
percent the previous week, and the 30-day compounded yield fell to 
4.52 percent from 4.54 percent, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was  
57 days, up from 54 days the previous week, IBC Financial Data 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading  
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks 
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the annual percentage 
yield available on money market accounts was 2.21 percent as of 
Wednesday, unchanged from the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the annual  
percentage yield available on interest-bearing checking accounts 
fell to 0.98 percent from 0.99 percent a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank Rate Monitor said the annual percentage yield was unchanged  
at 4.13 percent on six-month certificates of deposit, as were 
yields on 1-year CDs at 4.29 percent. However, yields rose on 
2 1/2-year CDs to 4.35 percent from 4.34 percent, as well as on 5-year 
CDs, to 4.49 percent from 4.48 percent.

<HEADLINE> MCI WorldCom Revenue Quadruples </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- MCI WorldCom posted strong profits in the  
final months of 1998, quadrupling its revenues in the first full 
quarter since WorldCom acquired MCI to form the nation's No. 2 
long-distance company. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported Thursday that it earned $442 million, or 23  
cents per share, in the fourth quarter, edging past most Wall 
Street forecasts. The results include a $14 million profit from a 
minority stake bought last summer in the Brazilian telephone 
company Embratel Participacoes. 
</P>
<P>
	In the fourth quarter of 1997, when WorldCom and MCI  
Communications had not yet merged, the companies posted a combined 
loss of $313 million, or 18 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom, formed by a $43 billion merger that close in  
mid-September, saw its fourth-quarter revenues rise to $9.02 
billion, up from $2.02 billion in the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues from communications services, including voice, data,  
and Internet operations, improved 17 percent in the latest quarter, 
rising from $6.5 billion a year earlier to $7.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market, MCI WorldCom's shares  
closed up $4.18 3/4 a share at $80.43 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong quarterly report came as MCI WorldCom announced a  
deal to sell its computer services unit to Electronic Data Systems 
Corp. for $1.67 billion as part of a broader deal under which 
13,000 employees will switch companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have intensified our focus on what we do best -- provide  
core communications services. Including today's announcement with 
EDS, over the past year we have shed virtually all of our 
non-communications services businesses,'' said Bernard J. Ebbers, 
president and chief executive officer of MCI WorldCom. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, merger-related expenses and other one-time  
costs pushed the company to a loss of $2.7 billion, or $2.12 per 
share. Excluding those one-time costs, the company earned $1.07 
billion, or $0.81 per share in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Those results compare with a combined 1997 loss of $308 million,  
or 18 cents per share, for WorldCom and MCI. 
</P>
<P>
	Full-year revenues totaled $30.4 billion in 1998, up 15 percent  
from $26.5 billion in 1997.

<HEADLINE> More Anti-Tobacco Verdicts Forseen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A California jury's record-shattering $51.5  
million verdict against Philip Morris for deceiving a sick smoker 
about the dangers of cigarettes could prompt a new flood of 
lawsuits and higher and higher penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	The tobacco industry's own multibillion-dollar settlement offers  
in other suits have served as a public admission of guilt, some 
analysts said Thursday. Compounding the problem are new disclosures 
of incriminating industry documents that plaintiffs' lawyers are 
eager to present to juries. 
</P>
<P>
	``When tobacco companies start offering billions of dollars of  
settlements, juries lose their sense of how much is a lot,'' said 
David Logan, a law professor at Wake Forest University who 
specializes in product liability. 
</P>
<P>
	That was clear in the case of Patricia Henley, 52, a former  
three-pack-a-day smoker who has inoperable lung cancer. Though her 
attorney, Madelyn Chaber, had asked for $15 million in punitive 
damages, the jury awarded $50 million, plus $1.5 million in 
compensatory damages. It was the first case to go to trial since 
California repealed a ban on individuals' lawsuits against tobacco 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury foreman George Loudis said Thursday some jurors wanted to  
go even higher. 
</P>
<P>
	``I accused a lot of them toward the end of losing touch with  
reality,'' he said. ``One woman said she contemplated $1 billion. 
... I mean the numbers just flowed out of their mouths.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris attorneys said the award stemmed from the  
``passion and prejudice'' of the jury and plans to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Only three other times have juries awarded smokers damages in  
health claims against tobacco companies and all of them have been 
overturned on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Up until this case, the largest verdict was $1 million awarded  
to the family of Roland Maddox, who died in 1997 of lung cancer 
after smoking for 50 years. A Florida appeals court threw out that 
verdict earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some experts say Henley's case marks a change of fortune  
for cigarette makers because of the change in environment. 
</P>
<P>
	Cigarette makers recently agreed to pay $246 billion to settle  
claims by states seeking to recover the health care costs of 
treating sick smokers. And sick smokers now have the benefit of 
sensitive industry documents -- forced into the public by states' 
lawsuits -- showing tobacco companies tried to hide the ill effects 
of smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first real lawsuit where you've had the entire  
record available to the jury,'' Logan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco company stocks fell Thursday for a second day after the  
verdict. Philip Morris lost $1.06 1/4 at $40.37 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Securities analysts had differing predictions on the outcome of  
individual suits against the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Feldman of Salomon Smith Barney said investors generally  
are more nervous about lawsuits by a large group or government 
rather than those of individual smokers. Cigarette makers will 
still find success in court assailing scientific data and placing 
the responsibility with the smoker, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that the industry's defenses will generally prevail  
in the majority of individual cases that are brought in the 
future,'' Feldman said. ``But it would be a serious mistake to 
believe the industry is going to win every individual case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Maxwell, however, counseled investors to steer clear of  
tobacco stocks. The analyst with Davenport &AMP; Co., whose Richmond, 
Va., office overlooks a Philip Morris plant, said the industry is 
at its most vulnerable point in history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's taking a whack at them, from Clinton to the  
federal government, to trade unions,'' Maxwell said, noting there 
are 850 lawsuits currently pending against cigarette makers. ``I'm 
sure a lot of them are going to be thrown out, but there are still 
going to be some that are going to go forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton recently announced he would follow the lead of  
states and sue the industry to over the costs of treating smoking 
illnesses. Several foreign countries whose residents have long 
smoked U.S. brands of cigarettes also have filed suits. And a 
class-action lawsuit on behalf of up thousands of smokers is 
currently in trial in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the size of Henley's award, analysts predicted a wave  
of lawsuits would follow, especially in California, a state which 
was among the first to ban smoking in some public areas and is home 
to many anti-tobacco lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would imagine that the tobacco executives are meeting at  
this very hour trying to figure out is it too late to clean up our 
act,'' said Richard Daynard, a Northeastern University law 
professor who has worked with states that sued the cigarette 
makers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think really for the first time in their history they're  
going to have to sit down and say maybe we should go for safer 
cigarettes, maybe we should go to plain packaging.''

<HEADLINE> Recordings Uncover Mystery of Seals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists long have wondered how 1,000-pound  
seals could chase down their dinner under the thick Antarctic ice 
sheet without popping up for a breath of air for an astounding 20 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Now marine biologist Randall Davis is solving the mystery, with  
a ``seal-cam'' that virtually lets him go along for the dive. 
</P>
<P>
	The tiny video camera and data recorder are providing 3-D  
pictures of the seal's mystery world -- and they reveal that the 
animals have great eyes for peering under the dim ice and somehow 
never lose their way back to a small air hole in the ice even if 
they roam a mile away or 1,000 feet under water. 
</P>
<P>
	``Terrestrial biologists have the advantage of being able to go  
out and observe their animals fairly easily. But ... we know 
basically nothing about underwater behavior,'' said Davis, who 
reports the first data from his three-dimensional tapes in the 
journal Science today. 
</P>
<P>
	``This technology allows us to travel vicariously with these  
animals to great depths and for the first time look at their 
behavior, ... foraging tactics, how do they stalk their prey,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, a marine biologist at Texas A&AMP;M University, strapped the  
data packs to the heads of Weddell seals, huge but fairly friendly 
mammals that hunt under the ice shelves of Antarctica. The packs 
combine a video recorder and equipment to gather information on 
sound, depth, direction, water speed, even flipper strokes -- 
basically everything the seal did and experienced once it dived 
under the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	The first surprise from the nearly 100 hours of tape: Seals may  
squawk a lot while lounging around on rocks, but they are stealth 
hunters, coming within inches of large fish without the prey 
noticing. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, they do not appear to use sound -- sonar or echolocation --  
to hunt, relying instead on eyes highly developed for peering 
through the murk below the 6-foot-deep ice. Davis' tapes show a 
seal gliding under a 100-pound Antarctic cod and tracking its 
silhouette in the dim light before moving in for the kill. 
</P>
<P>
	Another discovery was a novel hunting technique: The seal wanted  
some smaller fish that tried to hide inside crevices under the ice, 
so it blew a blast of air from its nostrils into the crevice. Out 
fled the fish, ripe for capture. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is really advancing our understanding of underwater  
foraging behavior,'' said Polly Penhale of the National Science 
Foundation, which paid for the research. ``You're getting a totally 
unique, three-dimensional picture of what the animal is doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weddell seals in particular fascinated researchers because of  
how long they dive without breathing. Twenty minutes is typical, 
but Davis recorded a 65-minute dive. The longest dive ever recorded 
is an astounding 82 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The seals spend most of their waking hours beneath the ice  
shelves, but they congregate around 4-feet-wide holes through which 
they emerge to gulp air. Davis' recordings show they can dive 1,000 
feet deep and swim almost 2 miles away from those holes yet 
unerringly find their way back before running out of air. 
</P>
<P>
	``These seals not only have to locate and capture prey, but they  
do it while holding their breath, and in such a way that they can 
find their way back to a fairly isolated breathing hole or they'll 
drown,'' Davis explained. ``That's a small point to locate in a 
fairly broad sheath of ice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How do they do it? When Davis returns in October to Sound,  
Antarctica, he will continue researching how the seals navigate 
accurately. 
</P>
<P>
	But as for holding their breath, it seems they have incredibly  
complex biology. Their blood and muscles have three to five times 
more oxygen-carrying capacity than humans', enough to survive those 
typical 20-minute dives. 
</P>
<P>
	For longer dives, their bodies actually alter blood circulation  
to sequester oxygen in the brain and heart; the rest of the body 
simply goes without, Davis said. That is very stressful and 
painful, and requires hours to recuperate, so really long dives are 
rare. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis' work has implications beyond seals: If scientists  
miniaturize the data pack a little more, they also could see into 
the alien world of other undersea creatures, even large diving 
birds, said Penhale of the NSF. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's advances like these that pique the interest of scientists  
to push the technology to the limits,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up on Europe Rate Cut Hope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against the euro Thursday as it  
became more apparent that the 11 European nations using the new 
currency are set to lower interest rates. The dollar also inched 
ahead of the yen as Japanese markets took a national holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.1235, down  
from $1.1331 late Wednesday. The dollar was quoted at 114.61 
Japanese yen, up from 114.28. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors felt vindicated when France's finance minister,  
Dominique Strauss-Kahn, said ``there could be room to lower rates'' 
given what is considered a weak rate of inflation in the euro bloc. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market believes it's when and not if they're going to cut  
rates,'' said Robert Katz, a foreign exchange dealer at MTB Bank 
Corp. Countries and regions lower rates to spur lending and 
building, but the cuts make the countries' assets and currency less 
attractive to foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, traders considered as benign the testimony Federal  
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan gave before Congress Thursday. His 
endorsement of a banking bill helped bank stocks rise and his lack 
of negativity overall helped stocks generally. 
</P>
<P>
	``That may have had a corollary effect on the dollar,'' Katz  
said. Also, he said, traders were bullish now that President 
Clinton's impeachment trial was nearly over. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, traders bought dollars and sold euros and Swiss  
francs, which had become a safe haven since the first couple of 
weeks of the new year. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's slight rise against the yen came not only during a  
Japanese holiday but a day before the Bank of Japan meets to make 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese central bank has been hammered by clamorous public  
demands to change monetary policy, particularly to buy its own 
bonds as a way to cap rising bond yields that have fueled the yen's 
rise. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a little bit of reticence to do anything ahead of the  
BOJ,'' Katz said. ``I think people may be holding on for a bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 114.61  
Japanese yen, up from 114.28 late Wednesday. The euro was quoted at 
$1.1235, down from $1.1331. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4236 Swiss francs, up from  
1.4073, and 1.4910 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4892. The British 
pound fell to $1.6226 from $1.6292. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on Thursday's euro rate, the dollar was worth 1.7408  
German marks, up from 1.7262; 5.8385 French francs, up from 5.7904; 
and 1,723.43 Italian lire, up from 1,709.40.

                      *Hector Alejandro Galindo    	
</P>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Hector Alejandro Galindo, one of the great  
directors in the ``Golden Age'' of Mexican movies, died Feb. 1 of a 
heart attack. He was 93. 
</P>
<P>
	Galindo directed more than 50 films, many of them box-office  
hits, in the 1930s through the 1950s, and also acted in several. 
His films focused often on down-and-out people -- drunkards, 
unsuccessful boxers, and the like. 
</P>
<P>
	Galindo traveled as an illegal alien to the United States and in  
the 1920s worked for MGM and Columbia pictures, starting by writing 
scripts for silent films. He later held various jobs in Hollywood, 
mostly dubbing movies into Spanish for Mexican markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in Mexico in the early 1930s, his first film ``Almas  
Rebeldes,'' or ``Rebel Souls,'' was an instant success. He is best 
remembered for his 1945 movie ``Campeon sin Corona,'' or ``Champion 
Without a Crown'' -- about the life of a promising boxer who makes 
it into the limelight but is crushed by the corruption of boxing 
authorities. 

</P>
<P>
                           *George Grooms    	
</P>
<P>
	WAYZATA, Minn. (AP) -- George Grooms, a stuffed-animal designer  
who created the original University of Minnesota Gophers mascot, 
died Saturday at the age of 83. 
</P>
<P>
	Grooms was assigned to design the Gopher mascot while he was  
working for the Collegiate Manufacturing Co. in Ames, Iowa, in the 
1940s. His grandson once wrote in the Minnesota Alumni Association 
magazine that Grooms was worried about the assignment because he 
didn't know what a gopher looked like. He ended up drawing a 
chipmunk. 
</P>
<P>
	Grooms founded Animal Fair Inc., a stuffed-animal company now  
operating in Chanhassen, in 1960.

	ITHACA, N.Y. (AP) -- Long-time Cornell University Professor  
Franklin A. Long died Monday, 30 years after his opposition to U.S. 
nuclear policy caused President Richard Nixon to block his 
nomination to head the National Science Foundation. Long was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Long, Cornell's vice president for research and advanced studies  
for much of the 1960s, achieved national prominence in 1969 when 
Nixon blocked his nomination to head the NSF. 
</P>
<P>
	Nixon made the move because of Long's stated opposition to the  
antiballistic missile system (ABM), then a controversial element of 
U.S. nuclear defense strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1968, Long had criticized the government's development of the  
ABM system on the grounds that it would generate ``strong pressure 
toward acceleration of the arms race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After several distinguished scientists came to Long's support,  
Nixon relented and offered Long the job. Long rejected it. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1969, Long began a four-year tenure at Cornell as director of  
a new research program designed to study the impact of science and 
technology on the problems facing society. He also served as 
director of the Peace Studies Program between 1976 and 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Long began his government service in 1942, working as an  
explosives supervisor for the National Defense Research Committee. 
Six years later he was awarded the U.S. Medal of Merit.

<P>
	PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) -- Thomas Milewski, executive vice president  
and chief operating officer of Greater Media Inc., died of cancer 
Monday at the age of 49. 
</P>
<P>
	Milewski was also the president of Greater Media's 14-station  
radio group, including five FM stations in Boston, four FM stations 
in Philadelphia, three FM stations in Detroit and WCTC-AM and 
WMGQ-FM in the New Brunswick area. 
</P>
<P>
	Greater Media, a privately held company, also owns cable  
television systems and community newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	Milewski joined Greater Media in 1973. He was promoted to vice  
president and general counsel, and in 1991 became executive vice 
president. He assumed the presidency of the radio group in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Milewski served on the boards of both the National Association  
of Broadcasters and the Radio Advertising Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife, Kathleen; a son, a daughter, his  
father, and a brother and sister.

	SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- Col. Robert S. Scott, a Medal of Honor  
winner who killed 28 Japanese soldiers during a fierce battle in 
World War II, died Friday. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott received the medal for ``conspicuous gallantry'' in the  
Solomon Islands. On July 29, 1943, Scott, an Army lieutenant, held 
his ground when the Japanese launched a fierce counterattack during 
fighting near Munda Airstrip at New Georgia in the Solomon Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	With only a tree stump for cover, Scott stalled the enemy  
advance with carbine fire and grenades. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott continued to fight even after his carbine had been shot  
from his hands and he had suffered wounds to his left hand and 
head. He used grenades to beat the enemy back, killing 28 Japanese 
soldiers in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	After World War II, he left the Army but re-enlisted in 1947 and  
served until 1966 when he retired with the rank of colonel.

<HEADLINE> Financial Turmoil Hits Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan is suffering its most severe  
financial turmoil in years, with share prices plunging and 
companies failing, but economists say they see no reason to panic. 
</P>
<P>
	The government is scrambling to control the damage, but experts  
say that with only modest official measures, such as stricter rules 
to prevent improper lending and excessive corporate stock 
investment, Taiwan's relatively healthy financial system can guide 
the island through the mess. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do have problems and we can expect more corporate troubles  
to surface,'' said Wu Hui-lin an economist at the Chunghwa 
Institute of Economic Research on Thursday. ``But Taiwan's free 
market system will prevent the crisis from getting out of hand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan has suffered less damage than many of its neighbors hit  
by the Asian economic crisis, though its economy has been slowing 
and many problems have started to emerge. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past few months, some banks were found to have improperly  
funneled funds to affiliated conglomerates that later got into 
trouble. Other companies saw their debts soar after borrowing money 
to buy stocks that soon fell in value. 
</P>
<P>
	Some healthy banks suffered losses in the stock market as they  
jointly set up a $8.7 million stock stabilization fund in November 
-- following a request from the government that they buy shares to 
prop up prices -- only to see shares shed nearly 15 percent since. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice Finance Minister Yen Ching-chang dismissed talks of a  
financial crisis breaking out in Taiwan, saying the economy is 
basically sound despite falling exports in the wake of the regional 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Troubled companies only account for 2.5 percent of the stock  
market capitalization, Yen has said. But authorities have taken 10 
firms out of the stock market to prevent their plunging shares from 
further shaking investor confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists say most banks can stand firm, and the turmoil should  
bottom out in a year or so if the government keeps its hands off of 
the market and lets prices fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the turmoil that has embroiled its Asian neighbors, many  
of which are laden with foreign debt, Taiwan's troubles arose from 
aggressive bank lending backed by massive domestic savings, which 
fueled a property and stock market boom. 
</P>
<P>
	But the speculative bubble finally burst and credit dried up.  
</P>
<P>
	Panic-selling was triggered last week when a top politician and  
businessman bounced checks of $3.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The case stunned the public as it showed cracks in a once  
formidable network of business and politics. With cozy ties to top 
politicians, many business groups have gained lucrative contracts 
or obtained easy bank loans or financial aid from the rich 
businesses run by the ruling Nationalist Party to play the stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the problems, Wu said, Taiwan's banks are smaller than  
counterparts in Japan and South Korea, so it should be easier to 
control their troubles. Also, banks have become more prudent 
following the corporate defaults. 
</P>
<P>
	If the crisis forces Taiwan to reform its financial sector, it  
will have helped the island strengthen its democratic and free 
market systems, said Ho Chia-chu, an economics professor at Soochow 
University.

<HEADLINE> Ex-BMW Exec May Be Heading to Ford </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- An executive who once was considered to be next  
in line to head German automaker BMW AG may be heading to Ford 
Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford president Jac Nasser on Wednesday would not confirm or deny  
a German news report that the Detroit automaker was about to hire 
former BMW board member Wolfgang Reitzle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Wolfgang is a tremendous executive and leader,''  
Nasser told reporters during the media preview of the Chicago Auto 
Show. ``I'm sad that he's in the situation that he's in. That's 
something for him and the board of BMW to work out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reitzle, who had once been considered the next in line to head  
BMW, resigned Friday in a management shakeup that also resulted in 
Chairman Bernd Pischetsrieder's ouster. The German news agency VWD 
reported that Ford would hire Reitzle as head of global 
development. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW also declined to comment on the report, attributed to  
unidentified sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Reitzle headed markets and product development for BMW, a maker  
of high-performance sports and luxury cars. His hiring by Ford 
would be a coup for the world's No. 2 automaker as it tries to 
strengthen its market position in Europe and elsewhere in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's shakeup led to widespread industry speculation that the  
company is seeking a change in direction that might include a 
merger or acquisition by a larger automaker like Ford or General 
Motors Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasser dismissed that speculation.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's not the way I read it. I read it as (the board) really  
trying to change what's happened rather than to change what could 
happen. I think it's a reflection of the Rover difficulties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute that led to Pischetsrieder's departure was over  
BMW's strategy for turning around its money-losing Rover unit in 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, they're going through a very difficult process,''  
Nasser said. ``The Rover acquisition has been a tremendous 
digestive problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked what he would do to correct Rover's problems, Nasser  
was coy. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the reasons we're valued as a great partner is because  
I think we do have the answers to those questions,'' he said. 
``It's a very, very sensitive issue. It's obviously got government 
and union and management and pride associated with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford, flush with $24 billion in cash, recently announced plans  
to buy Sweden's Volvo AB for $6.5 billion. The deal is awaiting 
Volvo shareholder approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasser said he has not talked to BMW or the Quandt family, which  
owns 42 percent of the company and would have to approve any deal 
with another automaker. But he noted that Ford is open to any 
overtures. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't rule out anybody,'' Nasser said. ``But I think when  
a company with the stature of BMW and their board come out and say 
they want to be independent, you have to respect that.

<HEADLINE> Social Security Battle Renewed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans took fresh aim at President  
Clinton's budget proposal Thursday, questioning whether his Social 
Security rescue plan might increase the financial burdens on future 
generations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The administration's proposal risks saddling our children with  
more debt,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House 
Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee's senior Democrat, Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y.,  
disagreed, saying Clinton ``is setting aside money to fund the 
promises that Congress has already made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He served the ball and now the Republicans seem to just  
criticize instead of offering a constructive counterproposal,'' 
Rangel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders have agreed with Clinton that 62 percent of  
expected future government surpluses should remain untouched while 
lawmakers work out a plan for Social Security's future. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is no agreement on how to bridge the Social Security  
cash shortfall expected when baby boomers retire. 
</P>
<P>
	At a hearing Thursday, Archer argued that if the surpluses were  
simply left alone, the financial benefits to the government would 
snowball in a cycle that would reduce the national debt faster than 
under Clinton's plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The influential Republican also echoed a separate concern that  
some economists share: Clinton's plan would earmark general tax 
revenue to Social Security for the first time ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders, however, have offered no alternative plan to  
shore up the retirement program. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration officials say they fear that without some  
concrete plan, the financial benefits resulting from the nation's 
current prosperity might never reach Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Temptation runs high for Republicans and Democrats alike to use  
any extra money for tax cuts or spending. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's plan ``makes it dramatically more likely that  
the debt reduction will actually take place instead of being 
overturned and spent by future Congresses,'' said White House 
adviser Gene Sperling. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's plan would use about $2 trillion in surpluses to pay  
back public debt -- money borrowed by the government from 
individuals and others who have bought Treasury bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists say reducing that public debt puts government  
finances on a stronger footing because interest payments aren't as 
high and the economy thus gets a boost. 
</P>
<P>
	Counting on those effects as collateral, Clinton would then  
place new IOUs in Social Security's trust fund, representing enough 
money to keep it healthy for about 20 years longer than now 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Clinton has called for bipartisan talks about what else  
might be needed, he has so far proposed no changes in Social 
Security benefits or taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	In effect, Clinton's plan would promise that when the special  
payroll taxes that have traditionally been Social Security's 
exclusive source of money run short -- as is expected in 2032 -- the 
government would make up the difference from general revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans are not alone in questioning that part of Clinton's  
proposal: A blue-ribbon commission two years ago unanimously 
rejected the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission's chairman, Edward Gramlich -- now a member of the  
Federal Reserve Board -- this week warned lawmakers of ``serious 
drawbacks'' to Clinton's plan, including that it could put 
retirees' needs in direct competition with other programs.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers Sue Diet Drug Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The maker of the now-recalled diet drug  
fenfluramine withheld information about cases of potentially fatal 
side effects and delayed stronger warning labels until it had 
rolled out another weight-loss drug, say lawyers suing the 
pharmaceutical company. 
</P>
<P>
	Fenfluramine -- which was half of the diet-drug combination  
fen-phen and was sold by the drug company Wyeth-Ayerst as Pondimin 
-- carried labels starting in 1988 warning that in rare instances, 
it caused pulmonary hypertension, a potentiallly fatal illness. 
</P>
<P>
	In June 1994, Wyeth's medical monitor, Dr. Frederick Wilson,  
told executives that he knew of 37 PPH cases, even though 
Wyeth-Ayerst had notified federal regulators of only four, 
according to internal documents acquired by Kip Petroff, a lawyer 
for 100 people suing Wyeth-Ayerst. 
</P>
<P>
	``In view of this, as well as other case reports ... revision of  
the current labeling should be considered,'' Wilson wrote in a 
memo. 
</P>
<P>
	Petroff said it took Wyeth-Ayerst two years to get the warning  
label to list more cases. He said that Wyeth-Ayerst was obligated 
by federal law to amend the labeling immediately and could do so 
without FDA permission. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyeth-Ayerst has been hit with hundreds of lawsuits over  
fenfluramine and another recalled Wyeth-Ayerst diet drug, Redux. 
The first case is scheduled to go to trial on March 16 in Fort 
Worth. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyeth-Ayerst spokesman Doug Petkus insisted that the FDA knew  
about the additional PPH cases while it was reviewing the new 
application for Redux and that the cases were discussed publicly by 
FDA advisory committee members twice in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Petroff represents clients in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and  
Arkansas who are suing Wyeth-Ayerst for unspecified damges for 
heart valve injuries, pulmonary hypertension and other ailments. 
</P>
<P>
	Pondimin and Redux were pulled from shelves in 1997 when the  
Mayo Clinic warned of heart-valve damage risks unrelated to PPH. 
The other half of fen-phen, phentermine, is still on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Evidence in the lawsuit includes an internal document calling  
for additional warnings. According to Petroff, such warnings were 
delayed by a June 1995 note from Dr. Marc Deitch, Wyeth medical 
affairs director. He wrote that officials ``need to discuss 
implication re: dexfenfluramine before proceeding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dexfenfluramine, marketed as Redux, went on the market in 1996.  
The labeling change on Pondimin became effective weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that what was done in this case was putting profits  
in front of patients' lives,'' Robert Kisselburgh, Petroff's law 
partner, said Thursday. ``It was in the company's economic interest 
to get Redux approved. It was worth millions of dollars to them.''

<HEADLINE> Tyson Not a Sympathetic Figure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	He sits in a jail cell, alone, pockets turned inside out,  
knowing only too well what the vultures still circling overhead 
know: That he is closer to the end of his useful days than the 
beginning. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, it's hard to make Mike Tyson into a sympathetic figure.  
Yet credit Montgomery County State's Attorney Douglas Gansler with 
this much: He sure gave it the old prosecutorial try. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Gansler violated the spirit -- if not quite the letter  
-- of a plea agreement growing out of an August traffic accident 
that landed Iron Mike behind bars once again. Tyson went in front 
of District Judge Stephen Johnson facing two counts of 
second-degree assault. He pleaded no-contest, thinking he had a 
deal. What he got was jail time. What he's thinking about now is an 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any prosecutor would do what I did,'' Gansler said Thursday  
from his office, not far from where Tyson was cooling his heels. 
``People are going to say what they're going to say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heavyweight-turned-writer Jose Torres, a one-time Tyson  
intimate, told an interviewer a few years ago that, ``We fighters 
understand lies.'' He was talking about feints and jabs, about the 
whole package of moves a fighter uses to disguise his real 
intentions. But on another level, Torres was referring to all those 
self-deceptions a boxer employs to screw up his courage, to stand 
in front of another man whose intention is to take his head off. 
</P>
<P>
	With those kinds of lies, Tyson has no problem, even now. We  
know this because he was never the same fighter after leaving 
prison in 1995, yet Tyson dutifully -- and very profitably, it 
should be added -- put himself back in harm's way inside the ring 
every chance he got. 
</P>
<P>
	What Tyson didn't understand, either before or after serving his  
time for a rape conviction, are the kinds of lies necessary to 
navigate life outside the ropes. That ignorance does not exonerate 
him in any way, nor does it soothe the people he victimized, 
terrorized, tried to buy off and then simply stepped over. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, betrayal was the one constant in Tyson's life. And this  
latest one serves the rest of us no better than it does him. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson didn't become a menace to society just last week, or even  
last summer. He was that his entire adult life. What has changed 
about Tyson is his ability to earn, to entertain, to fascinate the 
way he once did. That has diminished to the point where 
out-of-sight, out-of-mind is the most comfortable position to take 
on matters involving Iron Mike. 
</P>
<P>
	Gansler denies any such thinking on his part, and he makes a  
compelling argument otherwise. He did not actually use the word 
``jail'' in court, nor did he ask the judge to impose a specific 
term, which were the only requirements called for in the agreement 
Tyson's lawyers hammered out with his predecessor in the state's 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Gansler also pointed out that the judge's decision on sentencing  
is influenced more by advisory guidelines that his office's 
recommendations and that Tyson actually got less time -- two years, 
one suspended -- than a convicted felon would have received, on 
average, in a similar case. And the fact that Tyson settled with 
his two alleged victims -- in effect, bought them off -- had no 
bearing on the matter at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not atypical for the state to prosecute a case where the  
witnesses aren't aggressive. It happens in domestic cases all the 
time,'' Gansler said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I'll say this: I'd be subjected to harsher criticism if  
somebody with a rape conviction, while on probation, got out of a 
car and in an unprovoked way, cold-cocked a 62-year-old man and 
then kicked a 50-year in the groin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As we said, Gansler makes a persuasive argument.  
</P>
<P>
	On the other side, it's worth mentioning that he only took over  
as prosecutor last month, that Gansler said several times publicly 
that Tyson should do jail time, and that he included the kitchen 
sink in his argument before the judge, invoking Tyson's biting of 
Evander Holyfield in a June, 1997 bout, his weighty juvenile 
criminal record and even those dark-window-on-his-soul interviews 
that Iron Mike seems to revel in. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson spent lots of time and not a little money to buy off the  
drivers of the other cars and thus muddy up the details of what 
happened in last summer's three-car accident. But there's no doubt 
he overplayed his hand as the aggrieved hubby. Tyson paid for that 
transgression with the currency he understands best. 
</P>
<P>
	Making an example of him for its own sake is simply piling on.

	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Revenue from Suez Canal tolls fell for a  
fifth straight year in 1998, dropping to $1.76 billion from $1.79 
billion in 1997, the Central Bank reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline continued despite discounts offered by the Suez  
Canal Authority in an attempt to lure oil tankers and bulk 
freighters away from the route around Africa's Cape of Good Hope.

<HEADLINE> Orange Juice Down On Supply Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Orange juice futures prices tumbled 9 percent Thursday on the  
Board of Trade of the City of New York, the second consecutive day 
of sharp losses following a government report that predicted 
supplies will be ample for months to come. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, cotton futures fell while most energy products  
rallied. 
</P>
<P>
	Frozen, concentrated orange juice prices have lost nearly 18  
percent of their value in two days following the U.S. Agriculture 
Department's unexpected increase in the size of the Florida crop, 
which accounts for 90 percent of all U.S. orange juice production. 
</P>
<P>
	The department said warm, wet weather revived tree and helped  
boost the crop 2 percent, or 4 million boxes, to 194 million boxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, the estimated amount of juice per box was increased to  
a record 1.60 gallons, figures that point to consumers being awash 
in cheap orange juice in coming months. Market participants also 
noted the Brazilian orange crop also appears to be large. 
</P>
<P>
	Orange juice for March delivery 8.2 cents to 84.05 cents a  
gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	Cotton futures tumbled after the government reported large-scale  
cancellations of orders occurred in the past week, indicating that 
depressed demand may get worse before it gets better. 
</P>
<P>
	Domestic cotton mills also have sharply curtailed production,  
and the government recently predicted U.S. farmers will plant more 
cotton this spring than they have in the past, raising the 
potential for a large surplus by year's end despite the fact that 
last year was one of the smallest crops in recent history. 
</P>
<P>
	Cotton futures normally would be rallying sharply on lower world  
stockpiles, but sharply lower demand from manufacturers in Asia, 
Latin America and elsewhere because of the world economic crisis 
has taken center stage in the past few months. 
</P>
<P>
	March cotton fell 1.58 cents to 56.52 cents a pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Most energy products rallied on the New York Mercantile Exchange  
after the Clinton administration proposed shoring up the petroleum 
reserves the nation would tap in times of oil crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan announced by Energy Secretary Bill Richardson would add  
up to 100,000 barrels daily to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, 
with the government accepting oil instead of cash from companies 
paying royalties for drilling on public lands in the Gulf of 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	While that figure is far below the estimated 1.5 million barrels  
daily that analysts say is being overproduced, the decision helped 
prop prices that have been in a rut for days because of continued 
increases in American inventories. 
</P>
<P>
	March light, sweet crude rose 10 cent to $11.85 a barrel; March  
heating oil rose .10 cent to 30.39 cents a gallon; March unleaded 
gasoline fell .28 cent to 33.44 cents a gallon; March natural gas 
rose 6.2 cents to $1.837 per 1,000 cubic feet.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Scandal Will Sell Books </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Before it was a scandal, it was an idea for a  
book. 
</P>
<P>
	In the fall of 1997, a literary agent advised Linda Tripp to  
write a book about Monica Lewinsky and her affair with President 
Clinton. Fourteen months later, the president was impeached. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, with his Senate trial ending, the Clinton-Lewinsky story  
truly becomes one for the books. 
</P>
<P>
	A lot of books.  
</P>
<P>
	Memoirs. Analysis. Narratives. Over the next few months, and  
possibly longer, the publishing world will be in a position not 
unlike the House managers who called for Clinton's removal from 
office: trying to revive interest in a story the public has 
seemingly stopped caring about. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American people have said they didn't want Clinton removed  
from office and I don't think they'll be interested in books about 
the possibility of his being removed from office,'' said Eric 
Simonoff, a literary agent at Janklow &AMP; Nesbit Associates. 
</P>
<P>
	Books will arrive with dramatic, even melodramatic titles: ``Ask  
Not, Tell Not: The Triangulation of William Jefferson Clinton''; 
``A Vast Conspiracy: The Real Story of the Sex Scandal That Nearly 
Brought Down a President''; ``To the Point of Knives: The Triumph 
and Tragedy of Kenneth Starr.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the most anticipated book has the simplest title: ``Monica's  
Story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The book is Ms. Lewinsky's collaboration with Princess Diana  
biographer Andrew Morton. With a first printing of at least 
200,000, it is scheduled to come out late this month, around the 
same time ABC hopes to air an interview with Barbara Walters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm particularly interested in her book because I want to know  
what she says about Linda Tripp,'' said New York Observer columnist 
Joe Conason, who has a scandal-related book coming out in the fall. 
``There's a whole additional context to that relationship that 
Lewinsky might not have realized at the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Expectations for ``Monica's Story'' are so strong that some  
didn't need to read it to have an opinion. Amazon.com, the Internet 
bookseller, was posting rave ``reviews'' from readers even as St. 
Martin's Press was awaiting Morton's manuscript. 
</P>
<P>
	Readers will hear from at least one other associate of the  
president. Expected in March is ``All Too Human,'' a memoir from 
Clinton aide-turned-commentator George Stephanopoulos. Other 
Washington insiders reported to be working on publishing deals 
include presidential friend Vernon Jordan and Sen. Joseph 
Lieberman, D-Conn., the first lawmaker to condemn Clinton on the 
Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Fitting for a story which has been documented (some say  
prolonged) by the media, most of the books will come from 
journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Isikoff, the Newsweek reporter who helped break the  
scandal, will come out with ``Uncovering Clinton.'' Also expected 
are ``A Vast Conspiracy,'' by The New Yorker's Jeffrey Toobin, and 
``To the Point of Knives,'' a look at Starr and his investigation, 
co-written by Washington Post reporter Susan Schmidt and Time 
magazine's Michael Weisskopf. 
</P>
<P>
	While Schmidt has been criticized by Clinton supporters for  
being sympathetic to the independent counsel, Conason is 
collaborating with Arkansas Democrat-Gazette columnist Gene Lyons 
on ``The Hunting of the President: The 10-Year Campaign to Destroy 
Bill and Hillary Clinton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two books also are coming from columnists for the liberal weekly  
The Nation, a frequent critic of the president: Alexander 
Cockburn's ``The Joy of Sex: Bill Clinton and the Conquest of 
Puritanism,'' and Christopher Hitchens' ``Ask Not, Tell Not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchens himself has become part of the story. In a sworn  
deposition, he stated that during lunch with Sidney Blumenthal, the 
White House aide referred to Ms. Lewinsky as a ``stalker.'' In his 
own testimony, Blumenthal said he never passed on to reporters 
derogatory information he had received from Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, Hitchens' book has gotten a nice boost,'' said  
literary agent Lucianne Goldberg. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Mrs. Goldberg who in September 1997 discussed with Mrs.  
Tripp how the latter could benefit from what she knew about the 
affair between the president and the intern. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is good for you ... is a book,'' Mrs. Goldberg told Tripp  
during the phone call, according to the tape-recorded transcript of 
their conversation. ``The climate is extremely good for this kind 
of information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A month later, the tape was rolling.

<HEADLINE> Bill Can Block Costs for Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House has moved to restrain the  
congressional inclination to pass laws increasing costs to 
consumers and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, the first major bill to pass the House this  
year, was approved in a 274-149 vote Wednesday with 67 Democrats 
joining Republicans in support. Despite that bipartisan showing, it 
was opposed by the Clinton administration and split the business 
community, which widely backed it, from consumer and environmental 
groups that condemned it. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republican leaders are today offering another bill aimed  
at easing federal interference in the private sector. This measure, 
also opposed by environmental groups, would waive initial penalties 
for small businesses that make minor mistakes in complying with 
federal paperwork requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Mandates Information Act'' approved Wednesday requires  
congressional committees and the Congressional Budget Office to 
analyze the costs of laws and regulations. It also allows lawmakers 
to raise points of order, parliamentary objections, to any bill 
that lacks CBO estimates or costs the private sector more than $100 
million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	When a point of order is sustained by a vote, the bill is  
effectively rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, sponsored by Reps. Gary Condit, D-Calif., and Rob  
Portman, R-Ohio, strengthens the ``Unfunded Mandate Act'' passed in 
1995. That measure, a central part of the House GOP's ``Contract 
with America,'' allowed objections only on bills that impose more 
than $50 million on state and local governments. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to provide more information and more accountability to  
Congress,'' Portman said in debate beginning last week. ``We get a 
lot better legislation on the floor, legislation that is more 
cost-effective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, said Herman Cain, CEO and president of the National  
Restaurant Association, might give Congress pause before passing 
along costly mandates. ``It just makes sense that, before voting, 
members of Congress know the price businesses and workers have to 
pay to comply with government mandates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Daniel Weiss, political director of the Sierra Club, said  
passage of the legislation would ``ensure there will be further 
efforts to weaken clean air and water laws through backdoor 
amendments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``These votes demonstrate that the new House leadership is  
headed down the same anti-environment and anti-public health path 
as the pro-polluter 105th Congress,'' said Grant Cope of the 
environmentalist U.S. Public Interest Research Group. 
</P>
<P>
	The House defeated, by 216-203, an amendment by Rep. Henry  
Waxman, D-Calif., that would have allowed members to raise similar 
objections to bills that could weaken existing health, safety and 
environmental laws. 
</P>
<P>
	It also rejected, 216-210, an amendment by Rep. Sherwood  
Boehlert, R-N.Y., a GOP moderate, that would have made it more 
difficult to raise points of order and stated that such objections 
could not cut off debate on a bill. 
</P>
<P>
	A nearly identical bill passed the House last year by 279-132,  
but was not taken up by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican leadership has touted the bill as an example of  
its attempt to offer legislation that appeals to both parties, but 
the administration saw it differently. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration, in a statement, said it recognized the need  
for good cost analyses but opposed the bill, saying it created an 
obstacle to needed legislation by ``considering only the costs and 
none of the benefits of legislation that protects human health, 
safety, the environment or the nation's economic well-being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 350.

	Democrats Push for Censure Vote  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats are continuing their campaign for a  
formal vote to censure President Clinton at the impeachment trial, 
as prospects for his acquittal continue to grow. But Republican 
opposition seems to be stiffening, and Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., 
said censure would violate the constitutional doctrine of 
separation of powers. On Wednesday, three Republican senators 
declared they would vote to acquit on both articles of impeachment, 
the clearest sign yet that the vote to convict Clinton would fall 
far short of the needed two-thirds majority. Democratic leader Tom 
Daschle is hoping for at least a procedural vote before lawmakers 
adjourn, a roll call that would allow Democrats to go on record 
condemning the president's behavior.

	Admin. Says Troops Can Go To Bosnia  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Risking a blowup on Capitol Hill, the Clinton  
administration says it has the constitutional power to send 
American ground troops to Kosovo in a NATO peacekeeping force 
without congressional approval. Citing Bosnia as a precedent, 
Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering told a skeptical House 
committee Wednesday, ``There is ample constitutional precedent for 
this type of action.''

	300 Missing at Sea in Indonesia

<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Rescue teams searched in vain  
Wednesday for more survivors from a passenger ship that sank with 
332 people aboard between the Indonesian islands of Borneo and 
Sumatra. So far, 19 people have been rescued and one body has been 
found since the boat went down Sunday, officials said. Rescue teams 
re continuing their search, but with no new survivors found in the 
past 24 hours, hopes are fading. The leaky motorized sailing ship, 
was licensed to carry cargo but not passengers, officials and news 
reports are saying.

	Blood Transfusions Probed in Study

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cutting back on blood transfusions for the  
critically ill can actually improve some patients' chances of 
survival, researchers reported Thursday in the New England Journal 
of Medicine. The new study by Canadian researchers questions the 
common practice of giving critically ill patients red blood cells 
when they become mildly anemic. It suggests that waiting until 
anemia is severe can save both money and lives.

	Panel OKs Work Exemptions for Amish  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House panel has approved exemptions for  
Amish teen-agers to work in sawmills and woodworking shops despite 
concerns about flying debris and other dangers. The Amish have 
sought the exemptions since the Labor Department began fining Amish 
businesses thousands of dollars for employing youths in those 
businesses in violation of federal child-labor protection laws. 
Legislation approved on a voice vote Wednesday by the House 
Committee on Education and the Workforce would let Amish youths 
work in limited, supervised settings.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators returned today to their secret  
deliberations at the impeachment trial with the lone remaining 
drama centering on whether even a simple majority will vote for his 
conviction and removal from office. A vote is expected tomorrow. 
Majority Leader Trent Lott said 37 senators had yet to speak and 
his hopes for a vote today had dimmed. ``On or about noon tomorrow,

Wednesday, according to officials at AMR Corp., the parent company 
of American. More than 200,000 travelers have been stranded across 
the country and 2,500 flights canceled since Saturday as pilots,

<HEADLINE> David Hale Loses Bid To Stop Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Whitewater figure David Hale lost a bid  
Thursday to avoid trial on charges he tried to fool regulators into 
thinking he had enough money in his insurance company to pay 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Hale, who has claimed President Clinton pressured  
him into loaning money for a land deal, argued before the Arkansas 
Supreme Court that the charge is based on statements he gave under 
an immunity agreement with Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth 
Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale's lawyers claim those statements cannot be used against  
him, but the Arkansas Supreme Court sided with prosecutors who say 
they developed their case independent of Starr's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale also argued unsuccessfully that a trial would subject him  
to double jeopardy since his first ended in a mistrial. The court 
noted the mistrial was declared because Hale was having heart 
problems and could not continue. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale's National Savings Life Insurance Co. was told by the  
Arkansas Insurance Commission to add $38,757 to its company account 
in 1993 to meet state regulations on minimum capital requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Hale moved the cash into the account to create  
the illusion of financial health, then took it out.

<HEADLINE> Group Warns of Food Supply Clusters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent family farmers will be replaced by  
a ``seamless system'' where big companies produce everything from 
seed to the shelf unless steps are taken to halt the pace of 
consolidation in agriculture, a farm group warns. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe concentration will do more to influence the future  
structure of agriculture in the United States than the next farm 
bill,'' Leland Swenson, president of the 300,000-member National 
Farmers Union, told the House Agriculture Committee Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many predict that we will soon have a system where three or  
four companies control the food and fiber system at every level, 
from the seed supply until the time it reaches the consumer,'' 
Swenson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing was the latest on the concentration issue. Concerns  
about the number of mergers in agriculture have risen since Cargill 
Inc. of Minneapolis, the nation's No. 1 grain company, announced 
plans in November to buy the worldwide operations of second-ranked 
Continental Grain Co. 
</P>
<P>
	With already low prices in both livestock and commodities  
markets, many lawmakers and farm groups worry that the 
Cargill-Continental deal, which is being reviewed by the Justice 
Department, will further depress prices for farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't continue to put the squeeze on those at the bottom of  
the production chain,'' said Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Harry L. Pearson, president of the Indiana Farm Bureau, said the  
American Farm Bureau is concerned that concentration could lead to 
inadequate market access but has not taken a position on the 
Cargill-Continental deal. 
</P>
<P>
	But the National Farmers Union, which has called for a  
moratorium on mergers until the impact on agriculture is 
determined, painted a dimmer picture of what it calls ``the 
industrialization of agriculture'' in a study it released by a team 
of University of Missouri rural sociologists. 
</P>
<P>
	In the livestock industry, four large firms in each sector are  
slaughtering four out of five beef cattle, three out of four sheep, 
three out of five hogs and half of all chickens, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, 95 percent of all chickens are processed under  
production contracts -- a trend that concentration critics fear 
could stretch to other areas of livestock. 
</P>
<P>
	``The farmer becomes the grower, providing the labor and often  
some of the capital, but never owning the product as it moves 
through the food system and never making management decisions,'' 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also raised concerns about a ``seamless system''  
where companies control products from ``gene to shelf.'' Such 
clusters are already forming, the authors wrote, pointing to an 
alliance between Monsanto, one of the leading biotechnology firms, 
and Cargill. 
</P>
<P>
	Another example of a major food chain player is ConAgra, the  
report said, noting the company has subsidiaries along most links 
in the food chain. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Mark Drabenstott, an economist who heads the Center for  
the Study of Rural America at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas 
City, told lawmakers that consolidation in agriculture is 
``generally a positive trend'' that leads to lower-priced and 
higher quality food for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Farmers face a simple test: Build new relationships or be left  
out of the game,'' Drabenstott said.

<HEADLINE> Weiss Leads After Short Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Maybe Michael Weiss is better off chasing  
No. 1 than being in the top spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Skating as the favorite for the first time, Weiss turned in a  
less-than-perfect and somewhat lackluster short program Thursday 
night at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships. He was still first 
with all nine judges, but that was more out of reputation than 
repertoire. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy Goebel, the first American man to land the quadruple  
jump in competition, was second in the short program, worth 
one-third of the total score. Trifun Zivanovic was third. 
</P>
<P>
	The men's free skate is Saturday afternoon.  
</P>
<P>
	Weiss finished second to five-time U.S. champion Todd Eldredge  
the past two years and is the overwhelming favorite to win his 
first title this week. Though Eldredge kept his eligibility -- 
allowing him to compete at nationals, the Olympics and the world 
championships -- he's only competing in a select few pro-ams and 
isn't defending his title. 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing a psychedelic-looking gold, orange and brown lion-print  
T-shirt and charcoal leather pants, Weiss looked like the same old 
rebel with an attitude who enjoyed shaking up the staid world of 
figure skating. But when the music started, it was Weiss who looked 
dull. 
</P>
<P>
	His opening triple axel was out of whack, tilting like the  
Leaning Tower of Pisa, though he managed to save the landing. He 
lost his footing on his circular footwork and got off-balance, and 
he couldn't recover in time to complete it. Though his triple 
flip-triple toe loop combination was solid, it won't be enough to 
compete with the Russians at the world championships next month. 
</P>
<P>
	But Weiss showed some flashes of his old self, punctuating the  
guitar riffs with little hops and playing to the audience like he 
was skating in a show. As he slid to center ice to finish the 
program, he pumped his fist and mouthed the word ``Yow'' -- right in 
time with Van Halen's lead singer. 
</P>
<P>
	Goebel, who withdrew after the short program last year because  
of a lingering hip injury, was solid, but he's still lacking the 
flair he needs to win. Skating to ``Zorba,'' he at times seemed to 
be going through the motions instead of having a rousing time at a 
Greek wedding. 
</P>
<P>
	He seemed to get a little more enthused with his footwork,  
flying across the ice as the music got faster and the audience 
started clapping. And technically, he was fine. He was a little 
shaky on the landing of his triple axel, but he saved it, and his 
triple flip-triple toe loop combination was huge. 
</P>
<P>
	He ended with a flourish, sliding across the ice on one knee and  
pumping his fist as the music ended. He was so excited he almost 
missed a Beanie Baby that a fan threw on the ice, needing a fancy 
step to avoid skating over the doll.

<HEADLINE> Norwegians Favored in Giant Slalom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- Powerful Austria slipped up by letting Norway  
finish 1-2 in the men's combined competition. Now the duo of Kjetil 
Andre Aamodt and Lasse Kjus is hungry for more. 
</P>
<P>
	Aamodt, winner of the combined and bronze medalist in the  
downhill, and Kjus, co-winner of the super-G and silver medalist in 
the super-G and combined, are among the favorites for Friday's 
men's giant slalom in the World Alpine Ski Championships. They'll 
also challenge in Sunday's windup event, the men's slalom. 
</P>
<P>
	After an off day Wednesday, today's women's GS marked the  
opening of the technical portion of the two-week championships, 
after completion of the downhills, super-Gs and combined. 
</P>
<P>
	Austria's Alexandra Meissnitzer, with three victories in six  
races this season, was the favorite, although resurgent teammate 
Anita Wachter (two wins), Norway's Andrine Flemmen, Germany's 
Martina Ertl and Italy's Olympic champion, Deborah Compagnoni, 
loomed as threats. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think GS is the most competitive discipline, with so many  
good skiers -- Hermann Maier, Michael Von Gruenigen, Benjamin Raich, 
Lasse Kjus and Paul Accola,'' Aamodt said. ``I think in every race 
there was a new winner until the last race in Adelboden, when Maier 
won for the second time. 
</P>
<P>
	``So the field is very strong.''  
</P>
<P>
	Maier would appear to be the biggest threat, since he's the  
defending World Cup GS champion and is on a roll in the World 
Championships, sharing gold with Kjus in the super-G and winning 
the downhill. 
</P>
<P>
	Switzerland's Von Gruenigen, Austrian rookie Raich, Austria's  
Stephan Eberharter and Italy's Patrick Holzer have also won GS 
races this season. Aamodt, seeking a record 14th Olympic and World 
Championships medal, has been in the top four three times in six 
races. 
</P>
<P>
	He's also got a winning record on this GS course, coming from  
far back in the second run to win the 1994 gold on the way to the 
World Cup overall title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like this course. I just have to be really aggressive,''  
Aamodt said, then added with a mischievous twinkle in his eye, 
``and not drink too much beer the night before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus has yet to crack the top five in a World Cup GS this  
season, but that is more a product of bad health than bad racing. 
Kjus, the 1996 overall champion, has been bothered by a chest cold 
and respiratory problems, although he seems in perfect form here 
with three medals (a gold and two silvers) in three events. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is starting to be fun now,'' Kjus said. ``I'm really  
looking forward to the next race. Every medal gives me more 
energy.''

<HEADLINE> Brewery Criticized Over Beer Name </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Several people have complained that a local beer  
is in poor taste -- not for how it goes down but because of its 
name: Boston Strangler Stout. 
</P>
<P>
	Back Bay Brewing Co., which makes beers with names tinged with  
local color -- such as Boston Massacre Lager and Tea Party Porter, 
is thinking about finding a new name for the Strangler Stout in 
light of the negative reaction. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to try and do the right thing, to be sensitive to the  
victims' families,'' general manager Jim Lee said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives of the Strangler's victims said Back Bay should have  
considered their feelings before naming the beer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something we had to live with and it keeps being brought  
up, it still drives us crazy,'' said Casey Sherman, a television 
producer whose aunt, 19-year-old Mary Sullivan, was assaulted and 
murdered in her apartment by the Strangler in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
	The Strangler, one of the nation's most notorious serial  
killers, killed 13 women between 1962 and 1964. His victims 
generally were sexually assaulted in their apartments and 
frequently bound with their own clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert DeSalvo, a factory worker, claimed to have been the  
Strangler. While authorities lacked evidence to bring him to trial 
in the murders, he was convicted in 1967 of sex offenses, assaults 
and armed robberies and sentenced to life in prison. He was stabbed 
to death in his cell in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was just a terrible time,'' said Edward Brooke, who led  
the investigation into the crimes as Massachusetts' attorney 
general. ``It's not something you want to be reminded of when 
you're drinking beer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Back Bay marketing director Kristen Toli said the company  
generally names beers after notorious events in Boston history, but 
never with malicious intent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Strangler Stout is only served seasonally and won't be  
available after next week. As for whether it will reappear next 
year, Lee said: ``We'll have another 11 months to decide.''

<HEADLINE> Indiana on Tyson: Wait and See </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Indiana judge who sent Mike Tyson to  
prison won't consider revoking his probation before the boxer 
decides whether to appeal last week's sentence in Maryland, his 
probation officer said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson pleaded no contest to two misdemeanor assault charges and  
was sentenced Friday to one year in prison for kicking one motorist 
and punching another after a minor accident in Gaithersburg, Md., 
in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the former heavyweight champion have 30 days to  
decide whether to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not received any paperwork (from Maryland),'' said  
George Walker, Tyson's probation officer in Indiana, where he was 
convicted of rape in 1992. ``We had a case conference a couple days 
ago where we took into consideration the fact Tyson could appeal 
the sentencing in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	``So given that situation, we once again have taken a  
wait-and-see posture for the next couple weeks to see if in fact he 
does appeal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An appeal could lead to a jury trial and an even longer jail  
term in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he does not appeal, then we'll set a hearing here locally  
and move forward on that,'' Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson has 90 days to ask Judge Stephen Johnson to reconsider his  
sentence, but only 30 days to file an appeal -- which would take the 
case out of Johnson's jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's Maryland attorney, Robert Greenberg, said today he  
didn't expect a definite ruling from Indiana within 30 days, 
although he said he needs ``to get a better sense of what will 
happen in Indiana before any decision is made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Maryland sentence, he would be eligible in 60 days to  
be moved to a pre-release center, which he could leave during the 
day in order to train and return at night. With Johnson's 
permission, Tyson could travel out of state to fight, and with good 
behavior, he could be released from custody in seven months. 
</P>
<P>
	``If pre-release is not going to work -- either because of what's  
going to happen in Indiana or because pre-release isn't suited for 
Mike -- he could reconsider,'' Greenberg said. ``I know him to be a 
fair judge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson originally was sentenced to 10 years for raping a beauty  
pageant contestant in an Indianapolis hotel room in 1991. Four 
years were suspended, and Tyson served half of the remaining six 
years -- with three years off for good behavior -- before he was 
released in March 1995. Judge Patricia Gifford put him on four 
years' probation, which is scheduled to expire next month. 
</P>
<P>
	If Gifford schedules another hearing in Indianapolis, the  
expiration of Tyson's probation would be suspended until the matter 
is settled, Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case conference earlier this week, which included Gifford,  
was ``just to kind of get a status on the case, what the actual 
sentencing involved and just to kind of bring all the parties up to 
date on where things were and what the possibilities were for the 
near future,'' Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker said he has not indicated to Gifford whether he thinks  
Tyson should serve more time in Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not my decision. I wouldn't even say it's my  
recommendation,'' he said. ``In fact, I don't know particularly 
right now what my recommendation would be. It would be unfair to 
say that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would make a recommendation only if Gifford requests  
one. 
</P>
<P>
	In a probation report to Gifford in December, a week after  
Tyson's no-contest plea to the Maryland charges, Walker described 
the fighter as a man who had cooperated with authorities and lived 
up to all terms of his early release from prison until the scuffle 
with the two motorists. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker noted that Tyson has completed more than the required  
community service, completed a special counseling program for sex 
offenders and continues weekly counseling, all of which could work 
in his favor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Four years is a pretty good time to be on probation, and to  
get through 3 1/2 doing well is a pretty good accomplishment,'' Walker 
said in December's report. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana authorities also reviewed the probation -- but took no  
action -- after Tyson bit Evander Holyfield's ears during a title 
bout in 1997. The Nevada Athletic Commission stripped Tyson of his 
boxing license, but reinstated him in October.

<HEADLINE> MCI WorldCom Sells Unit to EDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- MCI WorldCom is selling its computer services  
business to Electronic Data Systems Corp. for $1.67 billion as part 
of a broader deal in which 13,000 employees will switch companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement calls for EDS, the leading supplier of computer  
services to the telecommunications industry, to provide MCI 
WorldCom with software and systems support over the next 10 years, 
a deal valued at $5 billion to $7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In turn, EDS is hiring MCI WorldCom to handle telecommunications  
for EDS and its customers, a contract that's expected to generate 
$6 billion to $8.5 billion in revenues for MCI WorldCom over the 
next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of both companies rose Thursday after the announcement.  
MCI WorldCom, which also topped Wall Street forecasts with its 
fourth-quarter report, closed up $4.18 3/4 a share at $80.43 3/4 in 
trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. EDS rose $2.43 3/4 a share to 
$48.31 1/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale of MCI Systemhouse comes amid a two-week flurry of  
activity by MCI WorldCom and long-distance rival AT&AMP;T in which both 
have been gearing up for the rapid convergence of telephone 
service, the Internet and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, MCI WorldCom introduced a local calling service for  
New York residents and launched an Internet access service to 
replace the one sold off last year to gain regulatory clearance for 
the merger between WorldCom and MCI Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves by MCI WorldCom followed news of an alliance between  
AT&AMP;T and Time Warner to provide calling, Internet access and 
television programs over Time Warner's cable TV systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The MCI Systemhouse division employs 9,000 people and has 120  
offices worldwide. Its clients include corporations and government 
agencies mainly in North and South America, Europe and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 12,000 employees from MCI WorldCom, including those at  
MCI Systemhouse, will be going to work for EDS as a result of the 
deals, while 1,000 EDS workers will be offered jobs with MCI 
WorldCom. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom is based in Jackson, Miss. EDS is based in Plano,  
Texas.

<HEADLINE> Goldie Hawn Accepts Harvard Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Goldie Hawn joyfully revisited her  
psychedelic go-go dance from her ``Laugh-In'' days as she accepted 
Harvard's Hasty Pudding Woman of the Year award. 
</P>
<P>
	Flanked by male Harvard students dressed in drag, Hawn was  
driven Thursday through Harvard Square in a BMW convertible en 
route to the awards ceremony and traditional roast. 
</P>
<P>
	There, the Academy Award-winning actress earned the coveted  
brass pudding pot after fielding questions about her movies from 
tuxedo-clad Harvard students. 
</P>

	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A rapist's 51-year prison sentence has been  
overturned on appeal because the judge turned to the Bible while 
deciding the punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court ruled that James Arnett can seek a lesser  
sentence. Arnett, 33, was sentenced 13 months ago for raping and 
molesting his fiancee's 8-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	In weighing Arnett's sentence, Judge Melba Marsh said she turned  
to the Bible and read a verse in Matthew that said anyone who 
offends a child would be better off if ``a millstone were hanged 
about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court, in a 2-1 decision, concluded that Marsh acted  
outside Ohio's sentencing guidelines by using the Bible to 
determine Arnett's fate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We stress that this case is unusual in that a specific text in  
the Christian Bible was the determining factor in the judge's 
imposition of punishment,'' appellate Judge Mark Painter wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	In dissent, appellate Judge Lee Hildebrandt Jr. said it did not  
appear to him that Marsh based her decision on the Bible passage.

 *Clinton reference to Hitler 'irresponsible'    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- William Donohue, president of the Catholic  
League for Religious and Civil Rights, says President Clinton 
should apologize for an ``irresponsible'' remark about Hitler at 
the annual Presidential Prayer Breakfast in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton had said, ``I do believe that even though Adolf Hitler  
preached a perverted form of Christianity, God did not want him to 
prevail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Donohue said Clinton's statement would have been justified ``if  
Hitler had invoked Christ in his writings or speeches and had 
referenced Christ as the source of his crusade.'' But, he said, the 
Nazi leader ``was a neo-pagan terrorist'' who tried to destroy the 
church. 
</P>
<P>
	The Catholic League describes its purpose as defending Catholics  
against defamation.

 *Landmarks decision: Court upholds church exemption    	
</P>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif.(AP) -- A state law exempting religious  
organizations from local landmark preservation laws is 
constitutional, according to a state appeals court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the 1994 law, noncommercial property owned by religious  
organizations is excluded from historic landmark preservation laws. 
Thus a religious organization can alter or demolish a historic 
building if it decides the change is necessary for religious or 
financial purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	The law was challenged by the city of San Francisco and private  
landmark-preservation groups. They won a ruling in Sacramento 
Superior Court that the law established an unconstitutional state 
preference for religious organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	But the appeals court, 3-0, said the law merely removes a  
potential burden from the practice of religion by allowing 
religious organizations to decide which of their buildings should 
be preserved.

 *Church sells Murillo oil for $360,000    	
</P>
<P>
	HOLYOKE, Mass. (AP) -- A Holyoke church has sold a painting,  
believed to be by 17th century artist Bartolome Esteban Murillo, 
for $360,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Terry Smith of the United Congregational Church said  
the painting was sold at auction by Sotheby's to an undisclosed 
buyer. 
</P>
<P>
	The oil, ``The Penitent Magdalen in Prayer in a Mountainous  
Landscape'' was given to Grace Church in 1915 by William Skinner, a 
Holyoke silk-mill owner who wanted to ``inspire the working 
masses.'' Grace Church, which later merged with the First 
Congregational Church, is in an area where many millworkers lived. 
</P>
<P>
	The church was never certain the painting was by Murillo,  
although it bears his signature. Sotheby's, however, declared it an 
original. 
</P>
<P>
	The church has not decided what to do with the money, Smith  
said.

 *Church group approves same-sex unions    	
</P>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- A Presbyterian church group that  
represents 20,000 faithful in seven New York counties has approved 
same-sex holy unions that stop short of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that God's tears are a lot less every time we affirm  
monogamy over promiscuity,'' said the Rev. Steve Geckeler, minister 
of the Presbyterian Church in White Plains. His church was host to 
the Presbytery of the Hudson River, comprised of ministers and lay 
members from 96 churches who approved the motion by a vote of 107 
to 35. 
</P>
<P>
	However, ``a marriage is still understood as being between a man  
and a woman,'' Geckeler said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Presbytery voted three months after a Presbytery committee  
began investigating the South Presbyterian Church in nearby Dobbs 
Ferry, which openly performs same-sex unions. The committee found 
such unions are allowed, but they don't constitute marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Book of Order of the 2.7 million-member Presbyterian Church  
(U.S.A.) does not mention same-sex unions specifically, but church 
officials have recommended that ministers do not perform ceremonies 
that are the ``same as a marriage ceremony.''

<HEADLINE> Firefighting Film Opens at Museum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Anyone who ever wanted to be a smoke-jumper  
battling forest fires now can get a feel for the hot, dangerous 
battle without risking life and limb. 
</P>
<P>
	Viewers of ``Wildfire, Feel the Heat,'' a new giant-screen film  
opening March 12 at the National Air and Space Museum, get to see 
what it's like to fly in water-carrying airplanes and choppers, 
parachute from a C-47, slide down ropes from a helicopter and 
battle fires on the ground in California, Idaho, Oregon and 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	And besides the usual narration, they hear the scenes described  
by the firefighters battling the blazes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fire literally looks down on you and starts its own wind,''  
says firefighter Shonda Murray. ``To me, it's like it's taking a 
huge breath and trying to take that oxygen away from you and 
replace it with smoke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To firefighter John Metz the scene is ``almost surreal. It's  
almost as if we're in some sort of military action. There's an army 
of firefighters all wearing the same uniform. Helicopters hover 
overhead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a typical year, wildfires around the world burn an area the  
size of Portugal, reports the film, which will be shown in 
Washington throughout the summer and will also be in other giant 
screen theaters around the country. Half the blazes are started by 
lightning, the rest by carelessness or on purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	Camera crews from the Discovery and Learning Channel cable  
television networks shot the 40-minute movie last year, that 
group's first attempt at giant-screen production. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the most cumbersome, archaic, complicated and unreliable  
film format in the world,'' complained the film's director, Michael 
Slee. ``It's also the most beautiful, spectacular and stunning. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes three people, each in firesuits, to move the camera  
and film. They must carry the magazines, which each shoot just 
three minutes of film, in fireproof backpacks,'' he explained. 
</P>
<P>
	In one scene, smoke-jumpers parachute into a smoky forest. A  
camera mounted on one of the jumpers points down, showing the 
rapidly rising scene as he maneuvers frantically to avoid fire and 
dangerous trees. The screen fills with a shot of his feet as he 
thuds down onto the forest floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look up and see a big huge 10-foot flame coming and  
it just consumes a pine tree and makes it explode, to me that's 
like it's showing what it can do,'' says Murray. ``If you cross it, 
or if you get in its way, it won't hesitate to do that to you.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar edged lower against the yen and Japanese  
stocks advanced moderately in Tokyo on Friday morning as investors 
waited to see if the Bank of Japan would take steps to lower 
interest rates at a policy-making meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 114.34 yen, down 0.96 yen from late Wednesday  
in Tokyo and also below its level of 114.61 yen in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at 128.50 yen, down from 130.22 yen late  
Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese foreign exchange, stock and other financial markets  
were closed Thursday for a national holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average gained 59.39 points, or 0.43 percent,  
to 14,011.79 points at the end of the morning session. On 
Wednesday, the index had gained 49.74 points, or 0.36 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Most currency and stock investors avoided major moves as they  
waited to hear the results of a Bank of Japan policy board meeting 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some decision on interest rates policy is widely expected,''  
said Tsuyoshi Nomaguchi, a strategist at Daiwa Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Political pressure has been building for the Bank of Japan to  
buy government bonds to help lower interest rates. The central bank 
has refused, saying such a measure would spark inflation and 
trigger a sharp rise in interest rates in the long term. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent surge in the yields on Japan's long-term government  
bonds has sparked selling in the stock market and buying of the 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese stocks were also supported by a big gain earlier on  
Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average closed at  
9,363.46, up 186.15 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 5.98 points, or 0.55 percent, to 1,089.07. The 
TOPIX shed 0.56 points, or 0.05 percent, Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond  
rose to 2.060 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.995 percent, 
driving its price down to 97.96 yen from 98.46 yen.

<HEADLINE> IOC To Investigate S. Korean Member </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New evidence against the highest-ranking Olympic  
official implicated in the Salt Lake bribery scandal will be 
reviewed by an IOC panel, the committee's chief investigator said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim Un-yong, an executive board member and powerful sports  
agency leader, will have a chance to explain details of an ethics 
report that linked him more closely to the biggest corruption 
scandal in Olympic history, IOC vice president Dick Pound said. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview, Pound said the information released Tuesday  
tying Kim's son, John Kim, to a $75,000 telecommunications job 
directly funded by the Salt Lake City Olympic bid had not been 
available to the IOC when it initially investigated the South 
Korean member last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the case of Dr. Kim, we certainly did not know of the  
somewhat complicated employment relationships, other than what we 
read in the media,'' Pound said. ``So that's something that we will 
look at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said the report contained no bombshells but provided  
useful leads. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a number of names there that are going to come up,''  
he said. ``I think we are duty-bound to follow up and see if 
there's an explanation. ... It's out there now and we can't say we 
didn't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said that top-level Olympic sponsors remained loyal to the  
IOC despite criticism this week from the president of one, John 
Hancock insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the committee leadership would consider suggestions for  
choosing the host city for the 2006 Winter Games in June, and might 
back off an unpopular plan to have the site picked by a 15-member 
panel rather than the entire membership. 
</P>
<P>
	And he questioned whether the U.S. Olympic Committee could have  
done more about revelations that three top staff members discussed 
an athlete-training exchange that appeared to be involved in Salt 
Lake's vote-buying scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim was one of three members who remained under investigation by  
Pound's panel last month, when nine IOC members resigned or were 
expelled for taking cash, scholarships and excessive gifts during 
the Utah capital's successful quest for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	At that time, the only evidence Pound's panel had was that Kim  
helped secure a U.S. visa for a Russian student and may have helped 
his daughter land a piano recital with the Salt Lake Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake ethics report appeared to take that involvement  
deeper, although Kim has said this week that the report cleared him 
of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	The report detailed more than $1 million in improper payments to  
IOC members, including 10 implicated for the first time. In all, 24 
members -- a fifth of the IOC roster -- have been linked to the 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said he and the other five people on the IOC panel  
received the report Wednesday and would discuss it Friday or 
Saturday. Not all of the new cases appeared serious enough to 
warrant expulsion, he said, and at least two were familiar to his 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
	A $762 payment to Bold Magvan, the son of Mongolian IOC member  
Shagdarjav Magvan, ``did not register high on the radar screen'' 
compared with six-figure sums to other officials, Pound said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said his commission had some data about Raouf Scally,  
the grandson of Algerian IOC member Mohamed Zerguini, but could not 
develop a case. The Salt Lake report said Scally received $14,500 
for no apparent reason. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he said he was pleased to have panel's work to lead the  
next step of his own investigation, Pound criticized the lack of 
detail in some cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of loose ends dangling out there with no  
conclusions,'' he said. ``You can take leaps of faith and conclude 
there may have been inappropriate conduct, but it sounds like they 
may not have followed through and asked for explanations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound also was critical of the ethics panel's apparent lack of  
effort to get explanations from IOC members it cited, particularly 
Phil Coles of Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said Coles made four trips to Salt Lake and took in  
the Super Bowl at bid committee expense. Coles said he made one 
bid-sponsored trip to Utah, went to the football game as a guest of 
others, and never was approached by investigators to tell his side. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly Phil Coles has responded with a full broadside,''  
Pound said. He added that investigators ``perhaps could have at 
least found time to send him a fax and say, `This is what we have 
found and are duly bound to report. Do you have an explanation?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said any new action, such as more expulsions, would come  
at an emergency meeting of the executive board. 
</P>
<P>
	A special IOC meeting March 17-18 remains the target to complete  
the IOC investigation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound also questioned the USOC's response to an e-mail exchange  
included in the ethics report that contained discussions of 
``promises ... made to secure votes'' for Salt Lake. He said the 
only concerns seemed to be financial. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seemed to evolve into, `Promises, schmomises, it's not  
coming out of my budget,''' Pound said. 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC said it was never part of any vote buying. It called  
the remarks ``inappropriate'' and would await the results of its 
own ethics inquiry, headed by former Senate Majority Leader George 
Mitchell.

<HEADLINE> IOC Member Acknowledges Hiring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- International Olympic Committee member Jim  
Easton said his company, at the request of the Salt Lake bid 
committee, hired the son of IOC member David Sibandze of Swaziland, 
who resigned last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were doing a favor for the bid committee. In hindsight I  
wouldn't do it,'' said Easton, one of the United States' two IOC 
members. ``At the time it seemed perfectly acceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Easton, who also serves on the Salt Lake Organizing Committee,  
said he did not consider it unethical because Sibo Sibandze 
actually worked and Easton Aluminum paid his $9 per hour wages for 
errands, research and office help in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	He was hired on the strength of his application and retained  
because of his performance, Easton said. 
</P>
<P>
	It would have been different, Easton said, if it had been a sham  
job with the bid committee funneling money through his company for 
a relative of an IOC member. 
</P>
<P>
	Sibo Sibandze, who worked full-time for three months and  
occasionally during the school year while attending the University 
of Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got more than our money's worth,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Easton's company, now named Easton Technical Products, makes  
archery equipment, tents, tubing and ski poles. 
</P>
<P>
	Sibandze resigned his IOC seat in January rather than wait to be  
expelled after investigators learned the bid committee funded his 
son's education at the University of Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee spent more than $111,000 on the younger Sibandze  
from late 1991 through 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Sibo Sibandze also worked at the Salt Lake City Economic  
Development Office after receiving a master's degree from the 
University of Utah.

<HEADLINE> Senate Resumes Deliberations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Poised to acquit President Clinton, senators  
returned today to their secret deliberations at the impeachment 
trial with the lone remaining drama centering on whether even a 
simple majority will vote for his conviction and removal from 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Majority Leader Trent Lott said 37 senators had yet to speak and  
his hopes for a vote today had dimmed. ``I don't think that is 
going to be possible at this time,'' he told senators before the 
sergeant-at-arms closed the chamber doors for the debate. That 
would leave the vote on track for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's defenders were already looking ahead to life  
after impeachment. White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said 
Clinton would campaign vigorously to return the Congress that 
impeached him to Democratic hands in 2000 but wouldn't specifically 
target the 13 GOP House managers who prosecuted him. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said several of the prosecutors were in districts with  
little or no competition and ``I don't think the House managers are 
the most likely people'' that the Democratic Congressional Campaign 
Committee and others will target. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott blasted any White House talk of defeating Republicans on  
the eve of the vote. ``It is deeply troubling that the president 
views closure of this constitutional process as an opportunity for 
revenge,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	With Republican hopes for a 67-vote conviction margin now just a  
distant memory, attention turned to the struggle for a mere 
majority -- a legally empty result that nevertheless would offer 
rebuffed House prosecutors a symbolic achievement for their uphill 
work. Three Republicans have announced they will vote to acquit 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``The drama is going to be whether obstruction gets 50 votes or  
not,'' Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said. 
</P>
<P>
	The article cited by Schumer, obstruction of justice, has been  
considered the stronger of two charges in impeachment trial 
deliberations that enter their third day today. Numerous senators 
have predicted the perjury article against Clinton would not 
achieve a majority. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Republicans said Wednesday they will not vote to convict  
Clinton. If three more do so and all 45 Democrats vote to acquit, 
the articles would fall short of a majority. Opinion polls have 
shown consistently that about two-thirds of the public think 
Clinton shouldn't be convicted and removed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't be surprised if others would make a similar  
announcement -- how many I don't know,'' Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., 
said of anti-conviction Republicans. Mack did not announce his 
position. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly half the 100 senators had not addressed their colleagues  
after the second day of closed-door deliberations ended Wednesday. 
Votes on the articles were possible late today, but senators were 
prepared to delay the verdict until Friday. The votes would be in 
open session. 
</P>
<P>
	If acquitted, there is a chance that Clinton would face no  
formal rebuke by the Senate. A Democratic initiative to censure 
Clinton struggled for survival under Republican resistance. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said that if GOP leaders prevent  
a censure vote, supporters might simply draft a declaration 
condemning the president's behavior and circulate it for senators 
to sign. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's session spanned eight hours with several breaks  
along the way. More than 30 senators spoke, with most taking the 
maximum 15 minutes allotted and some reminded by Chief Justice 
William Rehnquist's gavel that time had expired. The first day of 
deliberations on Tuesday covered a period of slightly more than 
four hours. 
</P>
<P>
	While the transcript of the deliberations will remain secret  
unless the Senate changes its mind later, some senators have read 
to reporters the remarks they prepared for the closed session. 
</P>
<P>
	Moderate Republicans James Jeffords of Vermont, Arlen Specter of  
Pennsylvania and John Chafee of Rhode Island announced their 
opposition to conviction on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffords told reporters, ``The pressure is coming on to get a  
majority.'' But a spokesman for Lott said the leadership had not 
tried to line up votes for conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, R-Miss., issued a statement at mid-afternoon declaring  
that the evidence ``shows that the president has committed perjury 
and obstructed justice. The only question left is, will the Senate 
vote to find him guilty of committing these high crimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's actions to conceal his extramarital affair with Monica  
Lewinsky were widely condemned by Democrats and Republicans alike, 
including those opposing conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffords said Clinton ``gave misleading statements ... did  
obstruct justice, but his actions in this case do not reach the 
high standard of impeachment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Specter told reporters he couldn't bring himself to vote for  
acquittal when the roll is called, but rather would declare the 
allegations were ``not proved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chafee said that despite Clinton's ``reckless, tawdry  
behavior,'' he concluded that House prosecutors presented 
``circumstantial evidence'' that was ``rebutted by direct evidence 
or by confusion.''

<HEADLINE> American Drops Nearly 1,100 Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- More American Airline flights were canceled today  
as disgruntled pilots stayed out sick despite a federal judge 
ordering them to climb back into their cockpits. 
</P>
<P>
	Close to 1,100 flights were canceled today, more than the 990  
that were canceled Wednesday, according to officials at AMR Corp., 
the Fort Worth, Texas-based parent company of American. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't surprise me that we are having more trouble. As  
long as AMR management uses this confrontational approach it is not 
likely to get better,'' said Capt. Neil Ekblaw, an American pilot 
based out of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The company could not say which flights were canceled due to  
sick calls today and which were canceled due to previous sick calls 
and logistical backups. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations resumed today between the pilots union and the  
airline. 
</P>
<P>
	At Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, between 20 and 25  
morning flights were canceled. At O'Hare International Airport in 
Chicago, about 25 percent of American's flights were canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline estimated that 2,400 of its 9,400 pilots called in  
sick before Wednesday's order from U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall 
in Dallas to get back to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you call in sick and you're not really sick, you're a  
liar,'' the judge said. The union could be held in contempt if the 
sickout continued. 
</P>
<P>
	Allied Pilots Association president Rich LaVoy said the pilots  
will be advised to abide the judge's order. But during a previous 
pilot sickout against American in 1990, many failed to return 
despite a court order. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 350,000 travelers have been stranded across the  
country and 3,500 flights canceled since Saturday as pilots, angry 
over the slow integration of recently purchased Reno Air, started 
calling in sick. American pilots are barred by federal law from 
striking over the issue, but federal regulations do require 
individual pilots to call in sick if they think they are undue 
emotional stress. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if everybody heeded the judge's order, there will be  
cancellations over the next several days as the company works to 
get planes and crews moved to the cities where flights are 
scheduled, the company had said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be spending the next couple of days trying to get the  
airline back on its feet,'' said John Hotard, a spokesman for Fort 
Worth, Texas-based AMR Corp., American's parent company. 
</P>
<P>
	While chiding the pilots' union, the judge also criticized the  
airline for seeking the temporary restraining order because of the 
effects on service. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's silly for us to even be here,'' he said. ``It's like  
killing a gnat with a sledgehammer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some Reno pilots make half the $164,000 a year that an  
experienced American pilot makes. The American pilots want AMR to 
add Reno pilots to the higher pay scale more quickly, and want some 
of their own to move up the ladder. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR said that it will take about 12 to 18 months do that and the  
pilot union's demands would cost as much as $50 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
	At O'Hare today, the Leyden family from Glastonbury, Conn., were  
stranded while trying to get to Puerto Rico for a one-week 
vacation. American officials suggested the family of four go home 
and return Sunday, but Diana Leyden said she would rather wait. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever bills I get, I'm forwarding to American Airlines.  
This is ridiculous,'' she said. ``I can understand both sides but 
to do it this way is wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For passengers with travel arrangements through Monday, American  
said it would offer full refunds on all tickets or help them 
reschedule their flight without the usual service charge or 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	TWA, Delta and other airlines accepted American tickets in the  
same price class and waived the customary change of flight fee, as 
part of a pact between airlines.

<HEADLINE> Court Allows Deportation Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Thousands of illegal immigrants who are  
longtime U.S. residents can remain in the country while fighting 
deportation orders, a federal appeals court ruled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 2-1 decision, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld  
a judge's injunction blocking deportations during a lawsuit over a 
new law severely limiting eligibility for future legal residency. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling applies only to the 9th circuit, which covers nine  
Western states. Similar deportations have taken place elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling probably affects several thousand immigrants in the  
United States for more than seven years who claim they are eligible 
for suspension of deportation orders, said Marc Van Der Hout, a 
National Lawyers Guild attorney representing the immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the case started in 1997, Congress has changed the law to  
exempt immigrants from Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, Cuba and 
some eastern European countries from the limits at issue in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	A telephone call to the Immigration and Naturalization Service  
was not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	An illegal immigrant who has lived in the United States  
continuously for seven years can get a deportation order suspended 
by showing good moral character and the prospect of extreme 
hardship if deported. Suspension of deportation makes an immigrant 
eligible for legal residency. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1996 federal law placed a 4,000 annual limit on the number of  
immigrants eligible for suspension of deportation and transfer to 
legal residency status. 
</P>
<P>
	The limit covers the period from one October to the next. After  
3,900 deportation orders were suspended between October 1996 and 
February 1997, the chief federal immigration judge and the chairman 
of the Board of Immigration Appeals ordered immigration courts not 
to approve any more suspensions until at least April 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The new law also made immigrants ineligible for suspension if  
they had been given notice of deportation before attaining seven 
years of U.S. residency. After the 9th Circuit ruled that the new 
standard applied only to post-April 1997 deportation orders, 
thousands of immigrants rushed to have their suspension cases heard 
before April, only to be thwarted by the immigration officials' 
orders.

<HEADLINE> Track Star To Head Kenya Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- Former track star Kip Keino has replaced  
Charles Mukora as head of Kenya's National Olympic Committee, the 
East African Standard reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Keino, a winner of the 1968 Olympic gold medal in the 1500  
meters and silver medals in the 5000 in '68 and the 1500 and in 
'72, will head the committee until new elections in 2001, according 
to Tom O'Omuombo, secretary general of the NOCK said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mukora quit as head of the NOCK and as a member of the  
International Olympic Committee after the IOC's investigators said 
Salt Lake City bidders funneled $29,450 into a bank account of 
Mukora. 
</P>
<P>
	Mukora insists all the money went into his high-altitude  
training camp for runners. 
</P>
<P>
	But the independent daily The People said its reporters saw no  
training activities during a recent visit to where the camp is 
supposed to be, only cattle grazing. 
</P>
<P>
	Keino, who was the first vice chairman, could not be reached for  
comment today. After retiring from track, he went into farming and 
other businesses. He also runs a home for disadvantaged children in 
northwestern Kenya.

<HEADLINE> New Mexico Forward Walker Returns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- New Mexico junior forward Damion  
Walker, suspended last week by coach Dave Bliss for breaking team 
rules, was back in uniform for Thursday night's Western Athletic 
Conference game against San Jose State. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, averaging 10.5 points and 4.4 rebounds through the first  
22 games, did not make New Mexico's trip to Hawaii and San Diego 
State last week. He met the the 25th-ranked Lobos on their return 
to Albuquerque on Tuesday and the suspension was lifted a couple of 
hours before Thursday's game against the Spartans. 
</P>
<P>
	Bliss told an Albuquerque television station earlier Thursday  
that he expected the 6-foot-7, 225-pound Walker, transfer from 
Texas Christian, to display a better attitude and to not be a 
disruption to the team.

<HEADLINE> 5-Foot-5 Boykins Making It in NBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Walking into the New Jersey Nets'  
practice facility after the lockout ended, Jayson Williams 
remembers seeing the slight, baby-faced youngster in shorts and 
shirt who came up about his waist. 
</P>
<P>
	Must be ballboy tryouts and this guy is lost.  
</P>
<P>
	Well, Earl Boykins is handling the ball, but he's not a ballboy.  
At 5-foot-5, the Nets backup point guard is following in the 
footsteps of Muggsy Bogues and Spud Webb as one of the smallest 
players in NBA history. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only is he playing, in this lockout-marred season, he's  
given fans someone to cheer for without reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people first see me play, they are very excited for me,''  
said Boykins, who weighs 145 pounds. ``Their first assumption is he 
is like Spud or Muggsy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think every player brings something unique to the table. My  
size is one unique factor, but I can also score,'' he said. ``I can 
definitely keep the defense honest. You have to guard me in the 
offensive end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boykins proved that last year at Eastern Michigan, where he was  
second in the nation in scoring with a 25.7 average. 
</P>
<P>
	That wasn't good enough to get him drafted. So during the  
lockout, Boykins played 24 games with Rockford of the CBA, mostly 
as a reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	Hooking up with the Nets was a fluke.  
</P>
<P>
	Dave Pendergraft, the Nets director of player personnel, saw  
Boykins play once. He hit all six of his shots. Despite the 
performance, Pendergraft didn't put Boykins on his call-up list of 
players to back up injured Nets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought ``he'll never get through a pick and roll,''' said  
Pendergraft, who put another Rockford player on the list. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the lockout ended, Boykins got a chance because his agent,  
Mark Termini, pushed his services and free agent guard Eric Murdock 
didn't sign right away. The Nets also felt Boykins, with his 
quickness, would be helpful getting guard Sam Cassell, Kerry 
Kittles and Murdock back in shape. 
</P>
<P>
	Boykins seized the opportunity. He worked extremely hard and  
played well in practice and exhibition games against the Knicks. 
The clincher for Pendergraft was when Cassell told him that Boykins 
pushed him in practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``The little kid is like chewing gum you can't get off your  
foot, no matter how much you scrape,'' Pendergraft said. ``The damn 
guy holds his own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boykins' has 3-point range and understands the game. He'll  
penetrate, dump the ball inside to Williams and Keith Van Horn and 
then wait. As the defense collapses, Boykins steps back and finds 
the open space for his shot. 
</P>
<P>
	He could always shoot, but he ran the offense in his first two  
years in high school and college. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shooting sort of comes natural,'' said Boykins, who never  
attended a basketball camp or had a hoop in his back yard growing 
up in Cleveland. He either played at recreational centers or 
watched his father, Willie Williams, a Cleveland policeman, play in 
pickup games. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's my hero,'' Boykins said. ``I always looked up to him.''  
</P>
<P>
	Boykins now fits that role. In the Nets' two home games this  
week, fans have cheered loudly every time he's entered the game or 
scored a basket. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents are taking notice.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud of a guy like that because it says a lot about  
him,'' Orlando's Penny Hardaway said. ``To be 5-5 and be in this 
league, he knows going into every game he is going to have a 
mismatch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In two games, Boykins has averaged 16.5 minutes and six points,  
hitting 6 of 13 shots from the field. He's missed both his 
3-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal wasn't to play well in one NBA game,'' Boykins said.  
``In my eyes, I haven't done anything yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teams must reduce their rosters to 12 players next Friday. The  
Nets have 13 now and 12 of those have guaranteed contracts. Boykins 
doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
	Until then, he'll just keep playing hard.  
</P>
<P>
	If he's cut, Boykins may have earned a job somewhere else in the  
league. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's exciting to see a young guy a foot and a half smaller  
than everyone out there playing and doing things,'' Kittles said. 
</P>
<P>
	It sells, and the NBA needs that this year.

<HEADLINE> Kwan Wins Short Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- With no threats in the field at the U.S.  
Figure Skating Championships, Michelle Kwan challenged herself. 
And, of course, she won. 
</P>
<P>
	The sport's biggest star easily took the women's short program  
Thursday night, collecting a perfect 6.0 and eight 5.9s for 
presentation to boot. It should be more of the same Saturday in the 
free skate, when Kwan is expected to skate off with her third U.S. 
crown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt really strong,'' said Kwan, who still found some things  
to nitpick. ``My lutz was a little shaky, higher than usual. But I 
guess I have to be prepared for anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Except, almost certainly, losing against a group of young,  
generally unproven skaters -- at least at this level. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarah Hughes, the rising 13-year-old who was runner-up in the  
recent World Junior Championships, was second behind Kwan. Hughes, 
the American junior winner a year ago, edged 20-year-old Amber 
Corwin, who wound up third in the short program, worth one-third of 
the overall score. 
</P>
<P>
	But neither of them is likely to push Kwan, who instead must use  
inner motivation to progress this year. Tara Lipinski, who edged 
Kwan at the Nagano Games last February, is a professional. Nicole 
Bobek, the only other remote challenger to Kwan, dropped out of 
nationals because of illness. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never think about being No. 1 and skating against anyone,''  
Kwan said before nailing a triple lutz-double toe loop combination, 
a double axel and a triple toe loop, along with some sensational 
spirals. ``I've always been a competitor who always skates for the 
fun of it. I don't go out there and think I'm untouchable. I never 
think that way, because you never know. Tara was a skater that no 
one ever heard of and she won. So it could be anybody next.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It could be Hughes someday. Or the equally precocious Naomi Nari  
Nam, who despite banging her head on the ice when falling on a 
triple flip -- she appeared ready to stop skating, then continued 
and did everything else in her routine -- wound up fourth. Nam also 
is 13 and in her first year of seniors. 
</P>
<P>
	Corwin, sixth in the 1998 nationals, was the only woman to do a  
triple-triple combination, both toe loops. But she had trouble with 
her spins. 
</P>
<P>
	Angela Nikodinov, fifth last year, was expected to be Kwan's  
closest pursuer. But she had a bad night, failing to do a 
combination jump and cutting a triple flip into a double to drop to 
sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	All the shuffling might continue behind the top spot, which  
belonged to Kwan on what her coach, Frank Carroll, thought was not 
a special night for her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would call it a good, consistent performance,'' Carroll  
said. ``Remember, we are probably our own worst critics. It wasn't 
probably the greatest performance of her life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't need to be.

<HEADLINE> EPA, FBI Argue Over Chemical Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Environmental Protection Agency is  
exploring ways to provide sensitive chemical accident information 
to the public, yet keep it out of the hands of potential 
terrorists, an agency official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The release of information about so-called ``worst-case''  
accident scenarios at chemical plants has been a subject of intense 
negotiations between the EPA and security officials for months. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics, including FBI terrorist experts, have raised concern  
that the widespread availability of information such as likely 
chemical release points and potential casualties could be a ``road 
map'' for a terrorist attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy Fields, the EPA's assistant administrator for emergency  
response, agreed that the most sensitive information should be made 
public in a way that it cannot be put on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing before the House Commerce Committee hearing, Fields  
said his agency wants to limit access to this information in a way 
that ``balances the public's right to know with the sensitivity of 
the data.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agency plans to make the most sensitive information public  
to state and local authorities and to citizens near particular 
plants, but not for national distribution, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are working on a variety of options whereby we would insure  
if we respond to legitimate (information) requests we would not 
provide it in such a way that someone could take it and post it on 
the Internet,'' Fields said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Burnham, chief of the FBI's domestic terrorism section,  
testified that there are ``legitimate law enforcement concerns 
about the potential misuse'' of the chemical plant data. He said 
that while the information should be made public to local residents 
near a plant and to emergency response agencies and researchers, 
the FBI strongly opposes its dissemination on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Commerce Committee Chairman Thomas Bliley, R-Va., said he's  
thinking about legislation that would prevent such information from 
being put onto the Internet. It was not clear, however, how that 
would be accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA is required to make the information public under a  
right-to-know provision in the 1990 Clean Air Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The concern of the industry, said Arthur Burk, an official of  
DuPont Co., ``has always been how the data will be made public 
beyond the local community. If the information got onto the 
Internet it ``would increase the risk of terrorist actions against 
chemical facilities,'' he told the lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Orum of the Working Group on Community Right-to-Know,  
cautioned against restrictions on freedom of information and 
questioned whether release of the data actually would increase the 
terrorist threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there is a problem from potential terrorism, then there is  
still a problem if information is kept off the Internet,'' he 
argued. ``Keeping information off the Internet doesn't reduce 
actual hazards.''

<HEADLINE> Study Finds Car Seats Used Wrong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One of the most comprehensive studies to date  
on child car seats finds as many as 85 percent of parents install 
and use the seats incorrectly. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Safe Kids Campaign study was based on an analysis  
of more than 17,500 installed child seats over the past 17 months. 
The 85 percent figure tops the Transportation Department estimate 
last year of 80 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The group found that the majority of parents or caregivers made  
two or more mistakes in installing and using the seats, leaving 
children dangerously loose in their restraints in the event of a 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was to being released today.  
</P>
<P>
	The campaign said 63 percent of the time, the car seat was not  
secured tightly enough by the seat belt. A parent should not be 
able to move the seat more than 1 inch from side to side after it 
is installed. If a car seat is loose enough, a child can hit his or 
her head as the car seat bounces around in a crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign also found:  
</P>
<P>
	--33 percent of children were in restraints with loose harness  
straps. This problem could possibly lead to a child being ejected 
from the car seat in a crash. 
</P>
<P>
	--20 percent of children were in child seats where the harness  
straps were not correctly routed. 
</P>
<P>
	In 11 percent of the cases, infants less than a year old or  
weighing less than 20 pounds were observed riding in forward-facing 
car seats instead of rear-facing ones. The neck muscles of children 
under a year old are not sufficiently developed to ride facing 
forward in a crash. 
</P>
<P>
	In less than 1 percent of the cases, infants were placed in  
rear-facing infant seats in front of a passenger-side air bag. 
</P>
<P>
	Infants in rear-facing infant seats must never be placed in  
front of an air bag because they can be seriously injured or 
killed. More than a dozen infants have been killed in this way by 
air bags since 1990, according to the Transportation Department.

<HEADLINE> Shakeup at Salt Lake Olympic Panel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Salt Lake's scandal-scarred Olympic  
committee launched an internal shakeup today that included hiring a 
new chief -- Massachusetts venture capitalist Mitt Romney. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal is to make Utah proud, to make America proud,'' Romney  
said in accepting the position. 
</P>
<P>
	As Gov. Mike Leavitt announced a sweeping reorganization of the  
Salt Lake Organizing Committee, including new rules at avoiding 
conflict of interest, two leading members resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC gave Romney its unanimous endorsement to take over the  
committee running the 2002 Winter Games, which has been rocked by 
the biggest corruption scandal in the history of the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``These games and the preparations leading up to the games will  
comply with the highest level of ethical conduct,'' Romney vowed in 
remarks to the SLOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt proposed expanding SLOC's board of trustees from 33 to  
50 and stripping it of its decision-making authority, making it an 
advisory board to a new management committee of 20. 
</P>
<P>
	He also gave any SLOC member with a perceived conflict of  
interest 60 days to resign. The proposal directly affects SLOC 
trustees Earl Holding and Alan Layton. 
</P>
<P>
	Layton immediately resigned. His construction company won a $29  
million contract to enclose the speedskating oval. 
</P>
<P>
	Holding, who remained on the committee, is the owner of  
Snowbasin Ski Area, which will get $13.8 million from SLOC as the 
downhill and super-G venue, and Little America Grand, a hotel being 
built downtown that is expected to be the IOC's home during the 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Also resigning was Verl Topham, president of Utah Power who had  
served on the original bid committee, saying he was doing so for 
the good of the games. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor also proposed an open meetings and records policy  
and that SLOC members be required to attend 75 percent of meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	He also urged the IOC to continue its housecleaning. ``We cannot  
allow the integrity of the Olympics to be eroded by indecisiveness 
or arrogance,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney, the choice of Leavitt and SLOC chairman Robert Garff,  
met with members of a hastily organized selection committee Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	That came just hours after the SLOC ethics committee released  
its report saying bid committee executives engaged in unethical 
conduct in spending more than $1 million to curry favor with 24 
International Olympic Committee members and win the right to hold 
the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney, 51, a Republican who unsuccessfully challenged Sen. Ted  
Kennedy in 1994, is the son of the late George Romney, governor of 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	He lives in Belmont, Mass., and also has a home in Park City,  
Utah. He graduated from Mormon church-owned Brigham Young 
University in Provo, Utah, and has been a Mormon bishop (lay leader 
of a congregation) and stake president (leader of a group of 
congregations) in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney's Boston company, Bain Capital Inc., specializes in  
buying companies and turning them around. Domino's was a recent 
acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has the perfect business background. He knows how to take  
major businesses in trouble and turn them around,'' said Henry 
Marsh, one of a handful of board trustees asked by Garff on Tuesday 
to peruse applications for the top SLOC job. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC ethics report linked another 10 IOC members to the  
scandal, bringing to 24 -- a fifth of its membership -- the number of 
delegates accused of accepting excessive benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said the ethics report was being forwarded to its own  
six-man panel investigating the Salt Lake City case. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine members have either resigned or been expelled by the IOC  
executive board. Three others remain under investigation, one 
received a warning and one has died. 
</P>
<P>
	Further expulsions are likely before the special IOC assembly in  
Lausanne, March 17-18. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you find something that's a real breach, we basically have  
only one sanction, and that's expulsion,'' said IOC vice president 
Dick Pound, head of the internal inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC executive board delegate Jacques Rogge, a member of Pound's  
panel, said it would determine whether members were guilty of 
actual ethical violations. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to differentiate between what is a breach of the  
line, and what is so-called `lavish treatment,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC marketing director Michael Payne, in New York today to meet  
with Olympic sponsors, said the IOC is doing everything in its 
power to stamp out corruption and institute reform. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the head of Olympics sponsor John Hancock insurance  
criticized the IOC's handling of the crisis and suggested that IOC 
president Juan Antonio Samaranch's tenure may be running out. 
</P>
<P>
	But Payne rejected the continuing calls from outside the IOC for  
Samaranch to resign, saying the 78-year-old president is needed to 
lead the house-cleaning efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the president stepped down, you would have a presidential  
election with all the instability that would bring,'' Payne said. 
``That's the last thing you want at this stage. You need a firm 
hand at the top to drive through the changes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Payne said there was no crack in support from the Olympic  
sponsors who pay tens of millions of dollars to help finance the 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sponsors are standing, first of all, behind the games,  
and, second, behind the steps and action the IOC, Samaranch and the 
executive board are taking,'' Payne said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--Leavitt and US West denied there was a connection between a $5  
million Olympic contribution by the phone company and Leavitt 
pushing telecommunications deregulation. However, Leavitt said he 
was dropping deregulation from proposed legislation to wire Utah 
government and schools for fast Internet service. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Salt Lake bid committee's outside auditors, the accounting  
firm Ernst &AMP; Young, denied the ethics report's allegations that it 
had failed to call attention to undocumented expenditures by 
Olympic bid executives. 
</P>
<P>
	It said it identified and discussed undocumented expenditures  
with senior management and the chairman of SLOC's audit committee. 
However, James Beardall, chairman of the audit committee, told The 
Salt Lake Tribune that ``I was not made aware of undocumented 
financial expenses.... On the contrary, I was assured by the bid 
committee's auditors that there were no items of special 
significance not previously reported which should be brought to the 
attention of the audit committee or the board of trustees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Barbados IOC member Austin Sealy, implicated in the Salt Lake  
report, denied any wrongdoing. Bid records showed $3,000 a month 
passed through a company affiliated with a consultant to Sealy.

<HEADLINE> Saints Will Cut Loose Collins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The agent for New Orleans Saints quarterback  
Kerry Collins was told by general manager Bill Kuharich that coach 
Mike Ditka is not interested in re-signing the free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``He (Kuharich) just said that it was coach Ditka's decision,  
and that's the way he felt it was going to go,'' Leigh Steinberg 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditka confirmed that later Wednesday. ``It is my decision,''  
Ditka said. ``They're all my decisions. I'm the coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ditka cited the 14 turnovers Collins committed in less than 24  
quarters last season as the main factor in his decision not to 
re-sign the quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, 26, the fifth player selected in the 1995 draft, threw  
10 interceptions, fumbled eight times and lost four, and the Saints 
were 2-5 with him as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Turnovers) that was the glaring thing,'' Ditka said. ``That  
was what we were trying to overcome. We had (a franchise record) 55 
of them the year before. We were trying to stop doing that, and we 
did it pretty well for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't have 15 turnovers (actually 10) in the last four  
games, we might win three of them. Who knows? That's all. That's 
what it comes down to. Maybe I'm too old of a coach to teach new 
tricks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collins accounted for eight of those 10 turnovers. The Saints  
were 1-3 in the last four games, beating Dallas (22-3), then losing 
the final three to Atlanta (27-17), Arizona (19-17) and Buffalo 
(45-33). 
</P>
<P>
	Ditka said he reached the decision not to re-sign Collins after  
reviewing videotape. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins was arrested Nov. 2 for driving under the influence of  
alcohol in Charlotte, after the Saints had claimed him off waivers 
from the Carolina Panthers on Oct. 14. Collins subsequently was 
forced to undergo psychiatric counseling by the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Before joining the Saints, Collins was accused of being a racist  
and a heavy drinker during his three-plus seasons with Carolina. 
Collins was released after asking Coach Dom Capers to remove him 
from the lineup following the team's 0-4 start last season.

<HEADLINE> NFL Puts Cooke in Charge of Skins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- On the eve of free agency, NFL commissioner  
Paul Tagliabue on Thursday night stepped into a power struggle 
involving the Washington Redskins and declared president John Kent 
Cooke in charge of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue's move came after trustees of the estate of Cooke's  
late father demanded final authority for any and all dealings, 
leaving general manager Charley Casserly and coach Norv Turner 
powerless and the team in danger of losing several key free agents. 
</P>
<P>
	``Commissioner Tagliabue today confirmed that current Redskin  
management retains full authority to direct the operation of the 
team, including player and coach employment until the sale of the 
Redskins is approved by NFL clubs,'' read a statement from the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
	``The commissioner acted after learning that the special  
committee of the trustees for Jack Kent Cooke's estate recently 
denied management the authority to re-sign certain players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Casserly, whose hands had been tied by the trustees at the  
bargaining table, immediately got on the phone and reopened 
negotiations with quarterback Trent Green and others. He also cut 
disenchanted quarterback Gus Frerotte, saving the team a $1.25 
million roster bonus that would have been due at the end of the 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	``It means we have the go-ahead to operate,'' Casserly said.  
``We've done that. We've talked to Trent Green's agent. We'll be on 
the phone at 12:01 tonight talking to other free agents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Redskins' future remains in limbo, however, as NFL owners  
consider whether to approve the sale of the team to a group headed 
by brothers Howard and Edward Milstein and Daniel Synder for a 
league-record $800 million. The trustees of the late Cooke's estate 
agreed to sell the team to the Milstein-Snyder group on Jan. 10. 
Three-fourths of the NFL team owners must give their consent. 
</P>
<P>
	The buyers, trustees and many within the Redskins organization  
were hoping that approval would come at an owners' meeting next 
week in Atlanta, but that meeting was canceled Thursday. The next 
scheduled meeting of the full ownership is March 14-18 in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	Some owners have said they would have preferred that Cooke's  
son, John Kent Cooke, purchase the team. But the younger Cooke, who 
has represented the Redskins at league meetings for nearly 20 
years, was not able to outbid Milstein and Snyder in a months-long 
action conducted by the trustees. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NFL's finance committee meets Monday Feb. 15 in Atlanta to  
continue its review of the Redskins sale,'' the NFL statement said. 
``No committee recommendation on the sale is expected at this 
meeting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Signs of a tussle between the trustees and the Redskins  
management have been evident for days as the team made no progress 
in re-signing priority free agents Green, linebacker Marvcus 
Patton, receiver Leslie Shepherd and center Cory Raymer. Then the 
annual pre-free agency press conference was canceled Thursday with 
just two hours' notice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Under normal conditions, we could have reached a deal by  
midnight,'' said Glenn Schwartzmann, Shepherd's agent. ``They would 
have loved to be able to do that, but obviously the circumstances 
have been a little bit complicated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL's statement said the Redskins' current plans regarding  
player signings ``appear to be consistent with past practice at the 
Redskins. ...They offer no basis for concluding that current 
management is in any way acting other than in the best interests of 
the club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the trustees, Tagliabue advised that they should  
not ``make any changes or restrict in any way'' John Kent Cooke's 
current status or authority to manage the Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	The Redskins also tendered customary offers to several  
restricted and exclusive rights free agents, including running back 
Stephen Davis and safety Leomont Evans.

<HEADLINE> Brewery Criticized Over Beer Name </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The latest beer from Back Bay Brewing Co. is  
leaving a bad taste in the mouths of critics because of its name: 
Boston Strangler Stout. 
</P>
<P>
	The brewer makes beers with names tinged with local color, such  
as Boston Massacre Lager and Tea Party Porter. But it is 
considering a new name for the Strangler Stout in light of the 
negative reaction. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to try and do the right thing, to be sensitive to the  
victims' families,'' general manager Jim Lee said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Strangler, one of the nation's most notorious serial  
killers, killed 13 women between 1962 and 1964. His victims 
generally were sexually assaulted in their apartments and 
frequently bound with their own clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert DeSalvo, a factory worker, claimed to have been the  
Strangler. While authorities lacked evidence to bring him to trial 
in the murders, he was convicted in 1967 of sex offenses, assaults 
and armed robberies and sentenced to life in prison. He was stabbed 
to death in his cell in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was just a terrible time,'' said Edward Brooke, who led  
the investigation into the crimes as Massachusetts' attorney 
general. ``It's not something you want to be reminded of when 
you're drinking beer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives of the Strangler's victims said Back Bay should have  
considered their feelings before naming the beer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something we had to live with and it keeps being brought  
up, it still drives us crazy,'' said Casey Sherman, a television 
producer whose aunt, 19-year-old Mary Sullivan, was assaulted and 
murdered in her apartment by the Strangler in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
	Back Bay marketing director Kristen Toli said the company  
generally names beers after notorious events in Boston history, but 
never with malicious intent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Strangler Stout is only served seasonally and won't be  
available after next week. As for whether it will reappear next 
year, Lee said: ``We'll have another 11 months to decide.''

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Ethics Report Disputed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The Salt Lake Olympics bid committee's  
outside auditors disputes an ethics committee's allegation that 
they failed to call attention to undocumented expenditures by the 
bid executives. 
</P>
<P>
	The accounting firm Ernst &AMP; Young issued a statement Wednesday  
night saying that it did identify and discuss undocumented 
expenditures with senior management and the chairman of the 
organizers' audit committee. 
</P>
<P>
	However, James Beardall, chairman of the audit committee, was  
quoted in The Salt Lake Tribune today as saying, ``I was not made 
aware of undocumented financial expenses discussed in the ethics 
report.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``On the contrary, I was assured by the bid committee's auditors  
that there were no items of special significance not previously 
reported which should be brought to the attention of the audit 
committee or the board of trustees,'' Beardall said in a statement 
issued through his attorney, Jefferson Gross. 
</P>
<P>
	The report into the bribery scandal surrounding Salt Lake's  
successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games was issued Tuesday by an 
independent ethics panel of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Wednesday, Scott Peterson, managing partner of Ernst &AMP;  
Young's Salt Lake office, said, ``No Big 6 firm just blindly 
accepts management's explanations, especially when there's an audit 
committee and there are lots of discussions that occur.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel concluded that top bid executives Tom Welch and  
Dave Johnson unethically spent more than $1 million trying to win 
International Olympic Committee votes. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel also alleged failure of the bid committee's board to  
give proper oversight, and faulted Ernst &AMP; Young for accepting 
executives' explanations about why certain expenses were not fully 
documented. 
</P>
<P>
	Trustees who served on both the bid and SLOC committees also  
tried to fix some of the blame on auditors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The oversight failed, in my view, because of collusion,  
concealment, deception and the outside auditors' lack of finding 
the management's evasion of established procedures,'' said banker 
Spence Eccles. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC member Anita DeFrantz, a member of the SLOC board, also  
weighed in. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to wonder: what books were they looking at?'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	David Jordan, a former U.S. attorney and spokesman for the  
ethics panel, said that auditors appear to have accepted 
explanations of bid executives about why expenditures on IOC 
members were not documented properly. 
</P>
<P>
	Ernst &AMP; Young's statement late Wednesday said that in 1995 it  
did identify and discuss undocumented expenditures with senior 
management and the chairman of SLOC's audit committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were provided with assurances by these senior officials  
that the expenditures were approved by the executive committee and 
the board of trustees through the budgetary process,'' the firm 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It said it also discussed other issues, including the lack of  
segregation of duties, with the audit committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any suggestion that we blindly accepted management  
explanations is simply incorrect,'' the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan said that Ernst &AMP; Young would not allow investigators to  
photocopy work papers nor would they be interviewed. The only 
access, he said, was through SLOC's outside attorneys, who 
interviewed auditors. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Howarth, a spokesman for Ernst &AMP; Young, said that while the  
company did not make copies of its work papers, they were available 
at the firm's offices.

<HEADLINE> Idaho Aryan Leader Is Fined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COEUR d'ALENE, Idaho (AP) -- The leader of the Aryan Nations  
avoided jail time with a suspended sentence and fine for 
interfering with police at a disturbance outside the white 
supremacist group's compound. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Butler received a 10-day suspended jail sentence and a  
$150 fine Wednesday for the misdemeanor. Prosecutors had sought a 
jail sentence, but Magistrate Barry Watson denied the request, 
saying Butler's offense didn't involve violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Butler, 80, is the founder and leader of the Church of Jesus  
Christ Christian outside Hayden Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Police went to the compound last summer to investigate a report  
that a man with an assault rifle was stalking another man. 
</P>
<P>
	As officers held four men at gunpoint, Butler approached police  
and ignored their orders to stop. They then sprayed him with pepper 
spray. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Butler was hindering police. Butler said he  
only wanted to help.

<HEADLINE> Pork Producers Request More Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite a $50 million aid package last month,  
hundreds of pork producers are in danger of going out of business, 
industry leaders say. 
</P>
<P>
	They're hoping the government will ante up close to $500 million  
in additional cash. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are thousands of professional, efficient, conscientious  
pork producers who are teetering on the edge of bankruptcy through 
no fault of their own,'' Craig Jarolimek, vice president of the 
National Pork Producers Council, told the House Agriculture 
Committee on Wednesday. ``Their lives remain in jeopardy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government announced last month's multimillion dollar  
package in hopes of giving a boost to pork farmers, who have 
watched their prices drop to record lows in recent months. Hog 
farmers got as low as $8-$10 per hundredweight in December, 
compared to around $45 a year ago. That means a hog that used to 
bring in about $120 was worth just over $20. 
</P>
<P>
	The $50 million aid package was aimed at smaller producers,  
paying them $5 per hog on up to 500 animals taken to market. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's proposal would give pork farmers direct payments of  
$50,000 and is aimed at helping larger producers left out of the 
first deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more hogs you marketed, the more hogs you lost,'' said  
Steven Cohen, an NPPC spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	No exact formula for the payment proposal has been developed,  
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, speaking later before a  
House Appropriations subcommittee, said if Congress passed 
additional assistance for pork farmers, ``I'm sure we would support 
that.'' He said that while he recognized some farmers were left out 
of the package, USDA had only a limited amount of money to work 
with. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, an animal rights group protested giving any aid to pork  
producers. 
</P>
<P>
	Actor James Cromwell, star of ``Babe,'' urged Congress not to  
give money to pork producers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This cruelty is in effect subsidized through government  
support payments and government bailouts,'' Cromwell said.

<HEADLINE> Gore Letter Warns of GOP Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore is reaching out to  
potential contributors for his presidential campaign with his first 
direct mailing, appealing for help ``as I face down these personal 
attacks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two-page letter signed by Gore invites recipients to join a  
National Steering Committee and send contributions to build early 
support for his bid to succeed Bill Clinton in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``Republican candidates have already begun their attacks on me  
... and they will only intensify,'' Gore wrote. ``Will you stand 
with me as I face down these personal attacks?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter, dated February 8, was sent to anybody who has ever  
contributed to the Clinton-Gore campaign, well more than 100,000 
people, according to an adviser. The vice president has several 
fund-raising events on his schedule, but this is his first direct 
mailing. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a source familiar with Gore's fund-raising  
operation, the appeal is aimed at Democratic voters enraged by the 
impeachment of Clinton because of the president's efforts to 
conceal his affair with a White House intern. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic Party and its committees have reported dramatic  
increases in donations since they began citing in their 
fund-raising appeals GOP efforts to oust Clinton from office over 
the Monica Lewinsky issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has been loyal to President Clinton throughout, a point  
that has endeared him to the Democratic base, especially 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first election of the 21st century will be a defining  
moment in our history,'' the vice president wrote. ``It is 
imperative that we win this race. Your support is the key.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The alternative, he warned, is to let the nation ``succumb to  
the forces of divisiveness, extremism and personal destruction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our citizens are tired of the politics of personal attack, and  
we must transcend these destructive trends. We must not only move 
politics forward, but also upward, to a higher place,'' the letter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter touts strides made by Clinton and Gore since their  
1992 election, from low unemployment rates to a balanced budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president also highlighted goals for the future: making  
health care available to all, combatting climate change and 
improving education. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore cautioned supporters that ``this will not be an easy  
race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only other candidate for the Democratic nomination now is  
former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley. Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., and 
civil rights activists Jesse Jackson may yet get in.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Meets New German Chancellor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Add German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder to the  
long list of foreign leaders who admire President Clinton, 
notwithstanding his travails over impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think President Clinton is one of the great U.S.  
presidents,'' Schroeder said Thursday after a three-hour meeting 
with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Issues such as education, economics, the environment -- ``It is a  
joy to address these subjects with him,'' Schroeder told a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	A year of negative publicity over the Monica Lewinsky scandal  
appears to have had little impact on Clinton's standing abroad. 
Schroeder's comments Thursday echoed those of Argentine President 
Carlos Menem, who visited the White House a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
	When Clinton visited the U.N. General Assembly last fall, he was  
treated to a rare standing ovation by the dozens of assembled heads 
of state and other foreign dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
	For Schroeder, it mattered little that his visit came as the  
Senate's impeachment trial of Clinton was winding down. The issue 
did not arise during his White House meeting, Schroeder said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not interested in that subject at all,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Schroeder found common ground on Kosovo, which is  
the subject of peace talks between Serbs and Kosovo Albanians in 
Rambouillet, France. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot permit that they negotiate for weeks on end,''  
Schroeder said. He said the West has no reason to abandon its 
policy of resorting to military intervention, if needed, in the 
event the talks break down. 
</P>
<P>
	The two leaders also agreed to support reform in Russia.  
</P>
<P>
	One of the more divisive issues in U.S.-German relations  
apparently did not come up: the German effort to recover former 
East German spy files believed taken by the CIA after the fall of 
the Berlin Wall in 1989. The United States has not officially 
admitted taking the files. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder came here a little more than 100 days after taking  
office, succeeding former Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who led Germany 
for 16 years. U.S. officials said there has been continuity in 
German foreign policy since Schroeder succeeded Kohl, who had close 
ties with three American presidents. 
</P>
<P>
	But Helmut Sonnenfeldt, who watches German policy from  
Washington's Brookings Institution, said it is too early to pass 
judgment on Schroeder. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has no track record on foreign policy,'' he said. Besides  
that, he added, Schroeder has an anti-military faction in his 
coalition that could someday assert itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a lot of uncertainty as to what they (the German  
leaders) would do if some crunch or other were to arise,'' 
Sonnenfeldt said.

<HEADLINE> Boston Scientific Cuts 2,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NATICK, Mass. (AP) -- Boston Scientific Corp. will eliminate  
2,000 jobs, or 18 percent of its work force, over the next year as 
the company cuts capacity duplicated by its acquisition of 
Schneider Worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes will cost BSX about $62 million, mostly in severance  
and related expenses, company officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	About $36 million of the costs were included on the company's  
books in the purchase price of Schneider. The remaining $26 million 
will be taken as a charge in the fourth quarter. Earnings for 
Boston Scientific are due out later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear whether a total of 2,000 people  
would lose their jobs, or if some of the positions to be eliminated 
are already empty. The company currently has 11,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the company did not immediately return telephone  
messages left by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston Scientific paid $2.1 billion for Schneider Worldwide, a  
former Pfizer Inc. unit that makes devices used to unclog arteries. 
The purchase was announced in June 
</P>
<P>
	At that point, it was the 11th purchase BSX had made since 1995,  
and brought the total amount the company spent on acquisitions 
during that period to $5.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	BSX had not been without problems, however.  
</P>
<P>
	In November, the company's stock fell 11 percent in a single day  
after officials announced they had discovered accounting 
irregularities with a Japanese subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	Shipped products were being improperly recorded as sales,  
totaling $40 million to $50 million in the nine-month period ending 
Sept. 30, 1998. An additional $40 million in shipments were 
improperly recorded in earlier periods, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Further, the Justice Department has been investigating clinical  
trials of a heart device that was marketed and later recalled by 
Boston Scientific. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials said they were cooperating with the probe.  
</P>
<P>
	Boston Scientific is a medical technology firm that develops and  
manufactures diagnostic and therapeutic devices. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's stock closed at $26 Thursday in trading on the New  
York Stock Exchange, up 62 1/2 cents a share.

<HEADLINE> Caribbean Hurt By Airline Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) -- Caribbean tourism officials urged  
the region's small airlines to band together to offer alternatives 
to American Airlines, where a labor dispute plagued more travelers 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	American and its American Eagle subsidiary operate about 70  
percent of all flights to and within the Caribbean, and regional 
governments are worried the slowdown may affect the flow of U.S. 
tourists in the peak winter season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot continue where we are exposed to the whim and fancy  
of major carriers when this is in fact our critical industry,'' 
said Jean Holder, secretary-general of the Barbados-based Caribbean 
Tourism Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to somehow put together air transportation that is  
Caribbean-controlled,'' Holder said, urging leaders to meet to 
discuss ways to strengthen air transport in the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. judge on Wednesday ordered American's pilots to end the  
protest, but American said it was canceling another 29 flights 
Thursday to its regional hub in San Juan, Puerto Rico, because of a 
lack of crews. It predicted at least three more days of problems. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, more than 350,000 travelers have been stranded since  
Saturday, when American pilots began protesting lower wages paid to 
pilots from Reno Air, which American purchased in December. 
</P>
<P>
	American has offered hundreds of Caribbean travelers refunds for  
canceled flights, prompting hotel cancellations throughout the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
	Tourism organizations have repeatedly urged money-losing  
Caribbean airlines to combine some maintenance, ground handling and 
other operations to save money and add routes that could compete 
with American. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials recalled a short-lived American strike in 1997 that  
cost hoteliers and cruise operators millions of dollars. ``The 
Caribbean has been the greatest loser in this kind of 
uncertainty,'' Holder said.

<HEADLINE> Bucks Coach Karl To Make Home Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. FRANCIS, Wis. (AP) -- George Karl, who makes his home debut  
as coach of the Milwaukee Bucks tonight, might have been 
broadcasting the game if not for the twists and turns of ankles and 
luck. 
</P>
<P>
	Terrell Brandon, Glenn Robinson and Tyrone Hill missed most of  
last season's stretch run with injuries, costing the Bucks a 
playoff run and coach Chris Ford his job. 
</P>
<P>
	Karl, fired in Seattle after another playoff run ended without a  
ring, was close to taking a television analyst job before Sen. Herb 
Kohl, the owner of the Bucks, waved $20 million in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
	Karl decided not to hold out for a glamour job. After all, he  
saw a promising upside to the Bucks, who haven't made the playoffs 
in seven seasons. Now they have begun this lockout-shortened season 
with victories at Charlotte and Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they would have had an average March, they probably would  
have been a playoff team last year,'' Karl said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Bucks, who finished 36-46, lost Brandon, Robinson and  
Hill for more than 70 combined games. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Allen, who signed a six-year, $70.9 million contract  
extension Wednesday, was the only starter not to miss any time last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Injuries kind of killed us last year,'' Robinson said. ``We  
know we have a better team that what we played like last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hill said the Bucks are more resolute for 1999 than most teams.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're a lot more eager because the last month, April  
and part of March, we didn't play much,'' Hill said. ``Terrell and 
Glenn and I, we talked about it, you know, `Let's get this going, 
let's try to stay healthy.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Brandon missed 32 games with a sprained ankle. Robinson, who  
never missed a game in his first four seasons, sat out 26 games 
with a leg injury, and Hill missed 25 games due to injuries and a 
family illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Could they have returned to the lineup to help make a playoff  
push? 
</P>
<P>
	Karl doesn't care.  
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, I've heard a lot of stories about a lot of these guys  
and I told them in my first meeting with them, `I'm not making any 
judgments on you,' '' Karl said. ``There's a lot of things about 
George Karl that have been written that aren't true ... I don't 
think there's a need for me to look at what happened last year 
through other peoples' eyes because I wasn't here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brandon, who made 10 trips to Hawaii during the offseason to run  
in the sand and strengthen his ankles, said he doesn't understand 
why fans accused him of dogging it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't have had a cast on if it was just a regular  
sprained ankle,'' Brandon said. ``I was in a cast for three weeks 
and it seems like no one ever really saw that or understood what 
that meant. You just can't come out of the cast and start playing 
right away. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to rehab and get your conditioning back. It had  
nothing to do with Milwaukee or Chris Ford, he was a nice guy. Or 
anything else. It was just a matter of I couldn't plant, my lateral 
movement was slow. I couldn't move,'' Brandon said. ``Now I'm 
healthy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So are Robinson and Hill.  
</P>
<P>
	Brandon said having his health back has invigorated his spirit.  
</P>
<P>
	``For my ankle to really feel good, that is a plus for me and  
it's a plus for our ball club,'' he said. ``I'm excited about being 
healthy and not just basketball, but just waking up every day and 
not having to feel pain, that feels good.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Resumes Deliberations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Poised to acquit President Clinton, senators  
returned today to their secret deliberations at the impeachment 
trial with the lone remaining drama centering on whether even a 
simple majority will vote for his conviction and removal from 
office. A vote was expected Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Majority Leader Trent Lott said 37 senators had yet to speak and  
his hopes for a vote today had dimmed. ``I don't think that is 
going to be possible at this time,'' he told senators before the 
sergeant-at-arms closed the chamber doors for the debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``On or about noon tomorrow, this will come to a final vote,''  
Paul Coverdell of Georgia said after attending a lunch break 
meeting with other Republican senators. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's defenders were already looking ahead to life  
after impeachment. White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said 
Clinton would campaign vigorously to return the Congress that 
impeached him to Democratic hands in 2000 but wouldn't specifically 
target the 13 GOP House managers who prosecuted him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't think of a worse or more dumb strategy than going  
after people based on whether they were a House manager or not. ... 
I think we're a little bit smarter than that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott blasted any White House talk of defeating Republicans on  
the eve of the vote. ``It is deeply troubling that the president 
views closure of this constitutional process as an opportunity for 
revenge,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	With Republican hopes for a 67-vote conviction margin now just a  
distant memory, attention turned to the struggle for a mere 
majority -- a legally empty result that nevertheless would offer 
rebuffed House prosecutors a symbolic achievement for their uphill 
work. Three Republicans have announced they will vote to acquit 
Clinton on both charges. Others plan to vote against the perjury 
charge but for a separate article of impeachment alleging 
obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Republicans came forward today to announce they would vote  
to convict Clinton even though political polls show Americans 
overwhelmingly oppose the president's removal. ``I refuse to say 
that high political polls and soaring Wall Street indexes give 
license to those in high places who act in low and illegal ways,'' 
Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., said. 
</P>
<P>
	The obstruction article has been considered the stronger of two  
charges in impeachment trial deliberations that entered their third 
day today. Numerous senators have predicted the perjury article 
against Clinton would not achieve a majority. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Republicans said Wednesday they will not vote to convict  
Clinton. If three more do so and all 45 Democrats vote to acquit, 
the articles would fall short of a majority. Opinion polls have 
shown consistently that about two-thirds of the public think 
Clinton shouldn't be convicted and removed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't be surprised if others would make a similar  
announcement -- how many I don't know,'' Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., 
said of anti-conviction Republicans. Mack did not announce his 
position. 
</P>
<P>
	If acquitted, there is a chance that Clinton would face no  
formal rebuke by the Senate. A Democratic initiative to censure 
Clinton struggled for survival under Republican resistance. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said that if GOP leaders prevent  
a censure vote, supporters might simply draft a declaration 
condemning the president's behavior and circulate it for senators 
to sign. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's session spanned eight hours with several breaks  
along the way. More than 30 senators spoke, with most taking the 
maximum 15 minutes allotted and some reminded by Chief Justice 
William Rehnquist's gavel that time had expired. The first day of 
deliberations on Tuesday covered a period of slightly more than 
four hours. 
</P>
<P>
	While the transcript of the deliberations will remain secret  
unless the Senate changes its mind later, some senators have read 
to reporters the remarks they prepared for the closed session. 
</P>
<P>
	Moderate Republicans James Jeffords of Vermont, Arlen Specter of  
Pennsylvania and John Chafee of Rhode Island announced their 
opposition to conviction on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffords told reporters, ``The pressure is coming on to get a  
majority.'' But a spokesman for Lott said the leadership had not 
tried to line up votes for conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, R-Miss., issued a statement at mid-afternoon declaring  
that the evidence ``shows that the president has committed perjury 
and obstructed justice. The only question left is, will the Senate 
vote to find him guilty of committing these high crimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's actions to conceal his extramarital affair with Monica  
Lewinsky were widely condemned by Democrats and Republicans alike, 
including those opposing conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffords said Clinton ``gave misleading statements ... did  
obstruct justice, but his actions in this case do not reach the 
high standard of impeachment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Specter told reporters he couldn't bring himself to vote for  
acquittal when the roll is called, but rather would declare the 
allegations were ``not proved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chafee said that despite Clinton's ``reckless, tawdry  
behavior,'' he concluded that House prosecutors presented 
``circumstantial evidence'' that was ``rebutted by direct evidence 
or by confusion.''

joy to address these subjects with him,'' Schroeder told a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	A year of negative publicity over the Monica Lewinsky scandal  
appears to have had little impact on Clinton's standing abroad. 
Schroeder's comments Thursday echoed those of Argentine President 
Carlos Menem, who visited the White House a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
	When Clinton visited the U.N. General Assembly last fall, he was  
treated to a rare standing ovation by the dozens of assembled heads 
of state and other foreign dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
	For Schroeder, it mattered little that his visit came as the  
Senate's impeachment trial of Clinton was winding down. The issue 
did not arise during his White House meeting, Schroeder said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not interested in that subject at all,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Schroeder found common ground on Kosovo, which is  
the subject of peace talks between Serbs and Kosovo Albanians in 
Rambouillet, France. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot permit that they negotiate for weeks on end,''  
Schroeder said. He said the West has no reason to abandon its 
policy of resorting to military intervention, if needed, in the 
event the talks break down. 
</P>
<P>
	The two leaders also agreed to support reform in Russia.  
</P>
<P>
	One of the more divisive issues in U.S.-German relations  
apparently did not come up: the German effort to recover former 
East German spy files believed taken by the CIA after the fall of 
the Berlin Wall in 1989. The United States has not officially 
admitted taking the files. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder came here a little more than 100 days after taking  
office, succeeding former Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who led Germany 
for 16 years. U.S. officials said there has been continuity in 
German foreign policy since Schroeder succeeded Kohl, who had close 
ties with three American presidents. 
</P>
<P>
	But Helmut Sonnenfeldt, who watches German policy from  
Washington's Brookings Institution, said it is too early to pass 
judgment on Schroeder. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has no track record on foreign policy,'' he said. Besides  
that, he added, Schroeder has an anti-military faction in his 
coalition that could someday assert itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a lot of uncertainty as to what they (the German  
leaders) would do if some crunch or other were to arise,'' 
Sonnenfeldt said.

<HEADLINE> American Drops Nearly 1,100 Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- More American Airline flights were canceled today  
as disgruntled pilots stayed out sick despite a federal judge 
ordering them to climb back into their cockpits. 
</P>
<P>
	Close to 1,100 flights were canceled today, more than the 990  
that were canceled Wednesday, according to officials at AMR Corp., 
the Fort Worth, Texas-based parent company of American. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't surprise me that we are having more trouble. As  
long as AMR management uses this confrontational approach it is not 
likely to get better,'' said Capt. Neil Ekblaw, an American pilot 
based out of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The company could not say which flights were canceled due to  
sick calls today and which were canceled due to previous sick calls 
and logistical backups. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations resumed today between the pilots union and the  
airline. 
</P>
<P>
	At Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, between 20 and 25  
morning flights were canceled. At O'Hare International Airport in 
Chicago, about 25 percent of American's flights were canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline estimated that 2,400 of its 9,400 pilots called in  
sick before Wednesday's order from U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall 
in Dallas to get back to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you call in sick and you're not really sick, you're a  
liar,'' the judge said. The union could be held in contempt if the 
sickout continued. 
</P>
<P>
	Allied Pilots Association president Rich LaVoy said the pilots  
will be advised to abide the judge's order. But during a previous 
pilot sickout against American in 1990, many failed to return 
despite a court order. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 350,000 travelers have been stranded across the  
country and 3,500 flights canceled since Saturday as pilots, angry 
over the slow integration of recently purchased Reno Air, started 
calling in sick. American pilots are barred by federal law from 
striking over the issue, but federal regulations do require 
individual pilots to call in sick if they think they are undue 
emotional stress. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if everybody heeded the judge's order, there will be  
cancellations over the next several days as the company works to 
get planes and crews moved to the cities where flights are 
scheduled, the company had said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be spending the next couple of days trying to get the  
airline back on its feet,'' said John Hotard, a spokesman for Fort 
Worth, Texas-based AMR Corp., American's parent company. 
</P>
<P>
	While chiding the pilots' union, the judge also criticized the  
airline for seeking the temporary restraining order because of the 
effects on service. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's silly for us to even be here,'' he said. ``It's like  
killing a gnat with a sledgehammer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some Reno pilots make half the $164,000 a year that an  
experienced American pilot makes. The American pilots want AMR to 
add Reno pilots to the higher pay scale more quickly, and want some 
of their own to move up the ladder. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR said that it will take about 12 to 18 months do that and the  
pilot union's demands would cost as much as $50 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
	At O'Hare today, the Leyden family from Glastonbury, Conn., were  
stranded while trying to get to Puerto Rico for a one-week 
vacation. American officials suggested the family of four go home 
and return Sunday, but Diana Leyden said she would rather wait. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever bills I get, I'm forwarding to American Airlines.  
This is ridiculous,'' she said. ``I can understand both sides but 
to do it this way is wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For passengers with travel arrangements through Monday, American  
said it would offer full refunds on all tickets or help them 
reschedule their flight without the usual service charge or 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	TWA, Delta and other airlines accepted American tickets in the  
same price class and waived the customary change of flight fee, as 
part of a pact between airlines.
