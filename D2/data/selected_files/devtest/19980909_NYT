CRIME DOWN THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Led by a record drop in the number of killings
statewide, crime across California plunged during the first half of
1998, according to a state report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The report showed declines for every kind of violent crime, with
the number of homicides down 22.2 percent from the same time last
year. That represents the biggest one-year decline ever recorded in
California, said Attorney General Dan Lungren.
</P>
<P>
   Crime levels are now lower than at any time since the 1960s, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these figures pan out for the rest of the year, we'll have
a 53 percent drop in homicides,'' Lungren said during a meeting
with Los Angeles Daily News editors and reporters. ``I don't know
any other state that can say that.''
</P>
<P>
   The figures, he said, show the success of such crime-fighting
measures as the ``three strikes, you're out'' law, which mandates
25-years-to-life prison terms for violent criminals convicted of
their third felony offense. With about 36,000 people jailed by the
``three strikes'' law, Lungren said crime rates have dropped
because more criminals are off the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of them are now doing time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Criminologists, however, said the reduction in crime might have
more to do with California's robust economy than with any specific
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Full employment is the major factor,'' said Daniel Glaser,
professor emeritus of sociology at the University of Southern
California. Over the decades, crime rates tend to follow the peaks
and valleys of the economy more than any other indicator, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles mirrored most of those statewide declines, with
homicides down 29.3 percent and robbery falling 24.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, the number of aggravated assaults dropped 17.5
percent, and the number of rapes fell 5.6 percent. However, the
state report showed an increase in the number of rapes within Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   More recent statistics from the Los Angeles Police Department
show that trend reversing itself. By Sept. 5, city police recorded
2.9 percent fewer rapes citywide than during the same period last
year, said Deputy Chief Gregory Berg.
</P>
<P>
   Although the cause of the statewide decline in crime might be
open to debate, Lungren cheered its results. Had crime remained at
1993 levels, he said, 1.2 million more state residents would have
been victimized.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result of the record crime drop during the last five
years, more than 6,000 Californians were not murdered ... and more
than 8,500 women and children were not the victims of rape,'' he
said in a written statement.

ANALYSIS: LATE PRIMARY: JUST WHO DOES IT HURT OR BENEFIT? 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Robert Abrams won the New York Democratic
primary for Senate six years ago, his candidacy was instantly
debilitated by two political realities. The first was that a
rancorous primary fight had left him short on both campaign funds
and good will from voters. The second was that Sen. Alfonse D'Amato
had five times as much money, an advantage the Republican incumbent
demonstrated the morning after the primary with a flood of
advertisements attacking his new Democratic opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams quickly disappeared from public view to raise money to
pay for television advertising. But with just seven weeks between
the primary and the general election, he ran out of time, and
D'Amato won re-election by a single percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats believe that Abrams lost that election in those
first days after the primary, a defeat that is viewed today as
testimony to another way that New York State's notorious election
laws protect incumbents: setting a primary so late that challengers
have no time to prepare for the general election. And with this
year's primary falling on Sept. 15, there are a number of Democrats
who are resigned to history repeating itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The late primary is a disaster for Democrats, and I think a
disservice for the public as well,'' Abrams said in an interview
Tuesday, reflecting a criticism voiced by government watchdog
groups.
</P>
<P>
   In Albany, one of the candidates running in the Democratic
primary for governor, New York City Council Speaker Peter Vallone,
offered a similar complaint. ``I think it's a shame that we have
such a late primary,'' Vallone told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But such objections aside, it is far from clear that New York's
late primary inevitably runs to the disadvantage of challengers, as
was the intent of Republicans in Albany 25 years ago when they
passed legislation moving it from June to September. And that might
never be more true than this year.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic strategists looking beyond next Tuesday's primary now
see a handful of scenarios in which there might be real advantages
to some of the candidates, particularly in the Senate race, that
might at least counterweigh the disadvantages that challengers have
found with such a late primary.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of outcome is contingent on the primary being won by a
candidate who is perceived as a long-shot candidate (correctly or
not), who would benefit from the instant excitement that would
attend an unexpected victory and that could well survive a short
general-election campaign. Such a development seems best suited for
the Senate primary and would probably apply if either Rep. Charles
Schumer of Brooklyn or New York City Public Advocate Mark Green
were to defeat Geraldine Ferraro.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ferraro would probably not enjoy such a slingshot effect, if
only because she has repeatedly presented herself as the
front-runner in the Senate primary campaign. Accordingly, her
advisers seem the most concerned about the late primary. ``The
earlier you know the nominee, the easier it is to run,'' said
Stephen Gaskill, her communications director. ``It would be
fortuitous to have an earlier primary.''
</P>
<P>
   New York's is one of eight primaries that will be held on Sept.
15 this year. The others are in Connecticut, the District of
Columbia, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Rhode Island and
Washington. Hawaii holds its last-in-the-nation primary on Sept.
19.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The accepted wisdom is that a late primary makes it more
difficult to knock an incumbent out of office.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams is the most cited example. After his primary victory in
1992, he confronted a party that was beset by division, and he was
out of money. Given the quick general-election contest that faced
him, Abrams said Tuesday, he should have turned first to trying to
heal the rifts in the Democratic Party and begun campaigning across
New York State. He could not, and instead found himself forced to
make fund-raising calls in an unsuccessful effort to counter
D'Amato's advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I contend that Bob Abrams would be the incumbent United States
Senator today if the primary in 1992 had been held in June,'' said
Ethan Geto, who was Abrams' campaign manager. Geto called the late
primary ``a scandal exceeding the swamp of special interest
money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an incumbent protection club,'' he said. ``You have a
June primary, you have the time to rest, you have the time to raise
money, you have the time to get your campaign into fighting
shape.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are strong arguments that Abrams' problems were
particular to Abrams and that returning to the original June
primary might not help the out-of-power party. Had the Democrats
picked a candidate for Senate by now, he or she would almost
certainly have been the subject of a summerlong barrage of attacks
by D'Amato, who has raised more than $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, the Democrats have taken a number of steps to
avoid a repeat of 1992. The state's Democratic Party has assigned a
senior official to work full time on preparing for the
general-election campaign. Given D'Amato's perceived vulnerability,
whoever wins the primary is likely to enjoy an immediate transfer
of funds from national Democratic organizations in Washington, as
well as contributions from Democrats across the nation who want
D'Amato ousted.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike 1992, one of the candidates _ Schumer _ is
extraordinarily well financed. He has raised more than $12 million,
and could have about $4 million left after Primary Day. If Schumer
is the nominee, it seems unlikely that D'Amato will enjoy the
advantage of 1992, when he was able to run ads against his opponent
in the days after the primary election without a response.
</P>
<P>
   There is clearly a consensus among Democrats running this year
to move the primary back to June. ``It is unfair to voters and
candidates alike to have the height of the campaign occur during a
hot summer, when people are otherwise engaged,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   But that seems unlikely for the very reason that the date was
changed in the first place. The people who control the State
Legislature _ Democrats and Republicans alike _ are not about to
change it, a point emphatically made by legislative aides over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, though, it may not matter, and no one knows that
better than any of the state legislators who were around in 1974 to
vote on moving the primary from June to September. The change was
pushed by Republicans trying to help Malcolm Wilson, the former
lieutenant governor who became governor after Nelson Rockefeller,
who went on to become vice president under President Ford, left
office in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   In that first late Democratic primary, in September of 1974,
another Brooklyn congressman came out of nowhere in a crowded field
to become his party's nominee, creating a storm of excitement. And
that January, Hugh Carey was sworn in as governor.

   ST. LOUIS _ Just keep belting the ball out of the park, early
and often. This was the way to exorcise all the ghosts and the
shadows, the doubts and the quibbles, the parenthetical clauses and
the modifying phrases.
</P>
<P>
   Politely keeping Babe Ruth and Roger Maris on their pedestals,
Mark McGwire caught and passed them so early that nobody will ever
be able to drag out any statistical charts or convulated theories
to diminish what the big boy has done.
</P>
<P>
   Last night at 8:18 p.m. in the heartland time zone, the man with
the bulging forearms hit his shortest home run of this epic season,
merely 341 feet, just making it over the wall, near the left-field
foul pole. His 62nd home run in his team's 145th game gave him more
homers in a season than anybody who ever played major league
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can say they put an asterisk on it,'' McGwire said
after launching No. 61 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It was only a matter of time before McGwire crushed another. And
in a way, that took away from the drama. There has been no autumnal
chill, no pennant-race jitters, no sense of urgency, not like the
haunted Maris trudging around the bases with his head half down in
the Oct. 1 shadows of Yankee Stadium, doing it on the last day.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has earned his success by working through a mid-career
slump and injuries and personal doubts, brought on by a failed
marriage. He has openly discussed how he sought therapy, and has
been a model father, as well as volunteering in the battle against
child abuse. In this year of long home runs and adoring fans and
constant media attention, McGwire has seemed to grow into his role,
embracing Sosa in a friendly duel that has only good vibrations.
</P>
<P>
   It was only a matter of time before McGwire crushed the next
one, which he did last night in front of an adoring home crowd.
McGwire, who has been so poised, was distracted by the salute by
Chicago's Mark Grace and had to be reminded to touch first base as
he began a triumphal tour.
</P>
<P>
   The celebration included his lifting his 10-year-old son,
Matthew, high in the air, being embraced by Sammy Sosa, the
laughing cavalier who has chased him, and chases him still, and
then a warm embrace for the four sons and two daughters of Roger
Maris, the player who never came close to this kind of fun in his
bittersweet season of 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Impervious to major slump or serious injury or pressure, McGwire
made it easier for himself by roaring past 50, hitting 60 and now
setting his sights on 70. That's the way to do it.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Maris hit 61 homers in 163 Yankee games (including
a tie) in 1961, and Babe Ruth hit 60 homers in 154 Yankee games in
1927. Sosa has 58 homers in the Cubs' 145 games.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa has other concerns on his mind, a race for the National
League wild-card slot in the playoffs, so he must make contact, and
take the strategic base on balls, whereas McGwire, not involved in
any pennant race, has the liberty to swing away, even on a 3-0
count, which he did in the first inning last night.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth inning, McGwire swung at the first pitch, in a
stroke now grooved for producing historic numbers thought
impossible in the separate generations of Ruth and Maris.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, McGwire's excellence had taken away from the drama,
because were lacking only the name, rank and serial number of the
pitcher who would serve up No. 62 _ Steve Trachsel, as it turns out
_ and goodness knows how many beyond this one.
</P>
<P>
   After stultifying heat and humidity on the Labor Day weekend,
there was finally a brisk September feel to Busch Stadium last
night, but there still has been no autumnal chill, no pennant-race
jitters, no sense of urgency, not like the haunted Maris trudging
around the bases with his head half down, in the shadows of Yankee
Stadium, on the last day, Oct.1, 1961.
</P>
<P>
   To the ongoing melancholia of the Maris family, that was the
first year of baseball expansion, producing a 162-game schedule,
eight games more than the first 60 years of the century.
Commissioner Ford Frick, formerly Babe Ruth's ghost writer, tagged
a figurative asterisk on Maris, who had 59 homers through the first
154 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a great admirer of Ford Frick,'' said the new
commissioner, Bud Selig, ``but that was not one of his greatest
moments.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has come to understand the sentiments for Ruth and
Mickey Mantle during Maris's landmark season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have two strikes against you in the huge city of New
York,'' he said. ``I mean, that is not good. There again, there are
people being negative out there that just didn't want to see
somebody do history. The fact is, he did it. The fact is that
everybody should be happy for Roger Maris and his family. Records
are meant to be broken. It just happens that we are close to it
right now, and it is going to be broken.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, McGwire said of Maris: ``It was not fair to criticize
him. Is it his fault that he played when they changed it to 162
games?''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Maris Jr., has watched the home-run derby of 1998 with a
twinge of sadness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows who Mark McGwire is,'' he said. ``Everyone is
pulling for Mark McGwire and they want to see him do this, and I
think that would be just an outstanding feeling for my father. And,
yeah, I wished that would have happened for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Maris and Mantle were in the same lineup, while McGwire and Sosa
are rivals, giving remarkable extended performances that cannot be
even partially diminished by citing friendly ball parks, expansion
pitching, helpful supplements, weight machines, jet-age balls.
</P>
<P>
   These two men, along with Ken Griffey Jr., of the Seattle
Mariners, who came into yesterday with 50 home runs, are the next
generation of world-level athlete: McGwire, bulked up at 34 but
more agile than he was in his 20's; Sosa, powerful and compact; and
Griffey, lithe and airborne, pulling home runs back over the fences
on defense, laughing his way past the weight room and the pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   There was a flicker of an asterisk a few weeks back when it was
revealed that McGwire was taking androstenedione, a body-building
substance not currently on baseball's proscribed list. In taking
the drug, McGwire has done nothing illegal _ dangerous, maybe, but
not illegal.
</P>
<P>
   With his eye, with his hands, with his acquired hitter's
reflexes, he has deflected even that potential symbolic asterisk.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Maris died at 51, saddled with an asterisk, for all time.
By crushing so many home runs, so early, Mark McGwire has knocked
the asterisks out of the ball park.

   ST. LOUIS _ Mark McGwire made the most out of the least Tuesday
night, setting major league baseball's home run record by hitting
his 62nd and shortest home run of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Swinging at the first pitch from Steve Trachsel of the Chicago
Cubs with two outs in the fourth inning, the St. Louis Cardinals'
first baseman lined a low-flying shot that just cleared the
left-field fence not far from where the fence meets the foul line.
The drive was estimated at 341 feet, 6 feet shorter than McGwire's
previous shortest this season.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire thus beat Sammy Sosa of the Cubs, who was playing right
field, to 62. The two talented and likable players have been
engaged in a spirited race to the record that has captivated the
nation and returned to the sport many fans who had become
disenchanted by the disastrous labor dispute of 1994-95.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, a 34-year-old right-handed hitter, has hit five home
runs that soared more than 500 feet, the longest estimated at 545
feet at Busch last May 16. The blow that made McGwire the greatest
single-season home run hitter in major league history was not
typical of his patented high-flying projectiles, which soar
majestically into the air and descend into some distant seat in the
stands.
</P>
<P>
   This one nevertheless broke the tie that the red-headed McGwire
had forged only the day before. In 1961, Maris hit his 61st home
run in the Yankees' 163rd and last game. In 1927, Babe Ruth hit his
60th home run in the Yankees' 154th and last game. This was the
Cardinals' 145th game, including a tie that does not appear in the
standing.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire now leads Sosa by 62 to 58, but the man who will enter
the record book will be the one who has the most home runs at the
end of the season on Sept. 27. It is at least possible that McGwire
will be known as the player who broke the record, but Sosa will be
the one who winds up with the record.
</P>
<P>
   The record-breaking home run came against Trachsel, a
27-year-old right-handed pitcher, who entered the game with a 14-7
record and a home run ratio of one for every 9.5 innings.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's 62nd home run was his seventh against the Cubs this
season, matching the seven he slugged against the Florida Marlins
for the most against any team.
</P>
<P>
   When McGwire swatted Trachsel's pitch at 8:18 p.m. central
daylight time, expectant fans in the sold-out stadium were not sure
whether the ball would stay fair and whether it would clear the
fence. McGwire began cautiously running down the first-base line,
following the flight of the ball, and when he reached first he
missed the base as he nearly went into the arms of Dave McKay, the
Cardinals' first-base coach, who is his favorite batting practice
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so shocked because I didn't think the ball had enough to
go out,'' McGwire said right after the Cardinals' 6-3 victory.
``When I saw the ball leave, I looked up and Dave McKay was in my
way and I sort of missed first base and I had to come back and
touch it. I don't remember anything after that. I came in and
everybody was hugging me. They said, we still have to play a game.
I said, `Oh, my God, I can't believe this.' It's an absolutely
incredible feeling. I can honestly say I did it.''
</P>
<P>
   McKay, keeping his coach's head, quickly pointed to the base so
that McGwire would go back and touch it. McGwire did as the fans
let out a constant roar, then began trotting toward second. As he
rounded the bases, the Cubs' infielders congratulated him.
</P>
<P>
   Just short of home plate, Scott Servais, the Cubs' catcher,
shook his hand, and McGwire grabbed him around the neck. The
Cardinals mobbed McGwire after he stepped on the plate, and
Fernando Tatis, the young third baseman, who batted ahead of
McGwire, leaped on top of the mob to try to reach McGwire. The
exuberant McGwire then hugged his teammates individually.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, a figure wearing a Cubs uniform penetrated the
Cardinals' celebration. Sosa ran in from right field to
congratulate McGwire, a man he had come to have great fondness for.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who has grown to feel the same way about Sosa, picked
him up, and they embraced and slapped hands. Then McGwire ran to
the box seats next to the St. Louis dugout, jumped into the stands
and embraced each of the Maris children.
</P>
<P>
   Before the raucous, impromptu celebration was over, McGwire took
a microphone on the field and said over the public address system:
``To all my family, my son, the Cubs, Sammy Sosa, it's
unbelievable. Thank you, St. Louis.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of hours before the game, McGwire and Sosa met
separately with two officials from the Hall of Fame to discuss the
items they might give to the Hall to commemorate the home run
record chase that has captivated fans and players everywhere. The
officials had with them the bat Maris used to hit his 61st and they
handed it to both players to hold and swing.
</P>
<P>
   After McGwire swung it, he rubbed the barrel of the bat across
his broad chest and said, ``Roger, you're with me.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Cardinals' clubhouse before the game, Delino DeShields,
their second baseman, walked over to the mirror where the lineup
card was posted. ``Is this the Hall of Fame card?'' he asked no one
in particular, suggesting that McGwire would hit his 62d in the
game, making the card worthy of the Hall.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The card had been made out by Rene Lachemann, the team's third
base coach, in the absence of Manager Tony La Russa, who was on his
way back from his mother's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   La Russa was in the dugout when Sosa and McGwire batted in the
first. Facing Kent Mercker after Mark Grace singled home a run,
Sosa rapped a single past third base. The hit led to a second Cubs'
run.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire hit Nos. 60 and 61 in the first inning of games Saturday
and Monday. After tying the record Monday, he singled and hit two
fly balls for outs. In this first inning Trachsel threw the first
three pitches to McGwire out of the strike zone, much to the noisy
consternation of the fans in the sold-out Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   With camera flashes exploding all over the park, McGwire, given
a green light instead of the take sign usually signaled on that
count, swung at the 3-0 pitch and hit a grounder to short, where
Jose Hernandez routinely fielded the ball and threw him out. Sosa
batted again in the third inning and again hit a grounder toward
third. But this time Tatis scooped up the ball and started an
inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, McGwire stood on the grass several feet from the
on-deck circle. He held his 33-ounce, 35-inch bat against his right
shoulder and stared at Trachsel as he waited his turn at bat. After
he stepped into the batter's box and scraped the dirt with his
right foot, he stepped back from the plate, then moved back into
his batting spot. He swung his bat easily several times waiting for
Trachsel to go into his pitching motion. Then he cocked his bat and
swung at the first pitch. Bedlam followed.
</P>
<P>
   Given the attention focused on recent weeks on the fans who
caught the baseballs McGwire hit for home runs, the trajectory of
the record-breaking home run defused the issue of whether the fan
would sell the ball for hundreds of thousands of dollars, as some
entrepreneurs had offered to pay, or would give it to McGwire, who
has said it belongs in the Hall of Fame. No fan got the ball. It
was retrieved behind the left-field fence by a member of the
Cardinals' grounds crew.

NYC TO PAY $450,000 TO SETTLE SUIT OVER RIKERS HEALTH CONTRACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The city's public hospital agency has agreed to pay
$450,000 to settle a lawsuit in which St. Vincent's Hospital in
Manhattan charged that the agency unfairly awarded a prison
health-care contract to St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx last
fall.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year, $342 million contract, the largest prison
health-care contract in the country, was awarded last year to St.
Barnabas, which had almost no experience providing health care in
city jails. The suit by St. Vincent's, which had provided health
care to some city inmates for nine years, charged that the bidding
process put too little weight on a hospital's experience in prison
health care.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of St. Barnabas surprised many in the health-care
industry, and the hospital's management of services on Rikers
Island and at the Manhattan Detention Complex has been a subject of
criticism. St. Barnabas officials say their managed-care approach
is saving money while providing better care to inmates, but critics
have said the hospital is cutting corners to increase profits.
</P>
<P>
   And state officials are investigating allegations, first
reported in The New York Observer, that two prisoners died after
being denied proper treatment by St. Barnabas.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Health and Hospitals Corp., which runs the
public hospital system, said that they could not comment on
specific cases, but that the quality of health care in city jails
had not declined under St. Barnabas. They said the hospital won the
contract because it submitted the lowest bid and had a track record
of treating patients in the Bronx who had ailments that are
commonly found in jails.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Erazo, executive director for correctional health
services at the Health and Hospitals Corporation, said that the
quality of care in city jails under St. Barnabas meets the agency's
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Berger, the lawyer representing St. Vincent's, said the
$450,000 payment from the city was an admission that the bidding
process was faulty. But Lewis Finkelman, the city lawyer
representing the HHC, said the agency admitted no wrongdoing in the
Aug. 28 settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The $450,000, Finkelman said, was to defray costs St. Vincent's
suffered when it lost its contract for the Manhattan Detention
Complex, like severance pay for workers it had to lay off.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Sandler, a professor at New York Law School and a member of
the city's procurement policy board, said the settlement with St.
Vincent's could be seen as unusual for both sides. ``It is fairly
unusual for the city to settle with a bidder over its claims,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement comes amid a series of investigations into inmate
care in city jails under St. Barnabas.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Steinhardt, a spokesman for the State Commission of
Correction, said that state officials were investigating the death
of Isidro Pacheco, 21, whose aorta burst April 1. Paul Layton, a
lawyer for Pacheco's family, said Pacheco could have been saved if
St. Barnabas doctors had correctly diagnosed his condition after he
collapsed four times in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Steinhardt said state officials were also investigating the
death of Richard Franz, 45, who Layton said died of bone cancer in
mid-July after St. Barnabas doctors failed to treat his cancer.
Steinhardt said state officials were also investigating allegations
that three other inmates were denied proper medical treatment by
St. Barnabas doctors.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, law enforcement officials have said that the
Manhattan district attorney's office is investigating allegations
that medical supplies have been illegally diverted from Rikers
Island to St. Barnabas.
</P>
<P>
   John Boston, director of the Legal Aid Society's Prisoner's
Rights Project, said health care complaints have risen since St.
Barnabas took over the contract in January. ``We've received a
number of complaints about delays in hospitalization of prisoners
with serious medical problems,'' he said. ``Our investigation
indicates that some of those appear to be well founded.''
</P>
<P>
   Layton said the problem lay with St. Barnabas and the contract
the Giuliani administration is using for prison health care. Under
previous contracts, the city reimbursed hospitals for each medical
service each inmate received. Under the new contract St. Barnabas
is paid a lump sum each year for providing health care to inmates.
</P>
<P>
   St. Barnabas must pay for shipping inmates to the city's three
public hospitals that treat prisoners. But it can keep whatever
money is not spent on inmate care each year as profit.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the new managed care contract encourages St.
Barnabas to minimize the number of inmate hospitalizations off the
island.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ronald Gade, president of St. Barnabas, said the number of
prisoners sent to hospitals from Rikers Island has decreased by
roughly 65 percent since St. Barnabas took over. But he said that
was because St. Barnabas had added facilities to the island,
allowing more complex ailments to be treated there.
</P>
<P>
   Gade said care had actually improved on Rikers Island since St.
Barnabas arrived.

CLINTON AIDES DETAIL LEGAL STRATEGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The debate in President Clinton's inner circle
about whether to challenge the right of Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr to send a detailed impeachment report to Congress turned more
on political considerations than on legal grounds, presidential
advisers said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Clinton's lawyer, David Kendall, sent a letter to
Starr on Monday demanding strict limits on any impeachment report,
there was a general agreement among White House advisers that there
was no chance Starr would comply with any of the requests made of
him.
</P>
<P>
   There was also uncertainty among Clinton's lawyers about the
legal underpinnings of the letter, said the advisers, who spoke on
the condition of anonymity. But Clinton's political advisers argued
that they would reap significant political benefits in any event
and bolster their public argument that Starr was unfair.
</P>
<P>
   The issue turns on the language in the Ethics in Government Act,
which went into effect in 1994 after being signed by President
Clinton. The law provides that an independent prosecutor ``shall
advise the House of Representatives of any substantial and credible
information'' the prosecutor receives ``that may constitute grounds
for an impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall's argument is that such language does not permit a
report with conclusions because that would infringe on the right of
Congress to make its own judgment about Clinton's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Both Kendall and Starr sought to refer to the Watergate scandal
of 1973-1974 to support their arguments. But there was no
independent-counsel statute at that time. Nor has there been any
instance in which an independent counsel sought to forward
information about offenses that may warrant impeachment. In other
words, there are no precedents.

   BOSTON _ David Cone donned a gracious choir boy smile Monday and
said he was not quite good enough for Cy Young Award consideration.
The mask came off Tuesday night and he pitched his heart out
against Boston's Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Cone allowed just two hits in seven innings, facing one batter
over the minimum, striking out 11 and anxiously watching Yankee
closer Mariano Rivera hold a 3-2 lead in the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Cone, the American League's first 19-game winner, reduced the
Yankees' magic number for clinching the American League East to
one, in the vortex of an atmosphere charged with playoff intensity.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees scored two in the top of the eighth inning to assume
a 3-1 lead, Martinez leaving the mound and offering a sarcastic
salute to home plate umpire Mark Johnson after he walked three.
Cone had thrown just 103 pitches, but Yankees manager Joe Torre
replaced him, because of his determination not to overuse any of
his starting pitchers in the season's final weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox threatened in the eighth, but Rivera entered with
one out and shut down Boston, the score remaining at 3-1. Boston's
drumbeat started again in the ninth: A walk, a single, another
single, loading the bases with one out. Troy O'Leary smashed a
liner to center, where Bernie Williams caught the ball. The lead
runner tagged up and scored, the others intent on holding at first
and second.
</P>
<P>
   But when Williams' throw back to the infield skidded past Derek
Jeter, both runners advanced, the potential tying run to third, the
lead run to second. Cone, watching in the Yankees' clubhouse with
Graeme Lloyd, Tim Raines and others, was in partial agony. Jeter
walked the ball to Rivera on the mound, slammed it in his glove and
said, ``Go hard. Go hard from the first pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Stanley walked, re-loading the bases for Darren Bragg. But
Rivera reared back and threw three straight fastballs past Bragg,
and Cone was on his feet in the clubhouse, accepting
congratulations from teammates for outdueling Martinez. A little
nerve-wracking, Cone acknowledged later.
</P>
<P>
   This was the American League's first matchup ever between two
pitchers with 18 or more victories and with winning percentages as
high as Cone's .783 (Martinez carried a percentage of .818 into the
game), according to the Elias Sports Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Cone and Martinez pitched with anger and purpose and
determination, mostly anger. Each took turns silently raging about
something or other, the seething seemingly augmenting the
concentration and fastballs of each man.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez paused briefly preparing to deliver a pitch in the
first inning, and Jeter called time and stepped out of the box.
Martinez glared at him; a couple of weeks ago, he drilled
Minnesota's Matt Lawton for the exact same offense. Paul O'Neill
called time, too, and again Martinez stared in, livid.
</P>
<P>
   After Martinez finished in the top of the first inning, holding
the Yankees scoreless, Cone trekked to the mound and dug out a hole
in front of the right side of the rubber, the manner in which
pitchers mark their territory. Ahead in the count one ball and two
strikes to Darren Lewis, the very first batter he faced, Cone tried
to nip the outside corner with a split-fingered fastball and
thought he had been successful.
</P>
<P>
   But when Johnson, the home-plate umpire, called it a ball, Cone
began shaking his head in disgust, no doubt remembering another
game he pitched with Johnson behind the plate this year, in Texas _
Johnson suffered from the affects of heat and missed numerous calls
before removing himself from the game.
</P>
<P>
   Nomar Garciaparra, Boston's clean-up hitter, led off the second
inning and moved ahead in the count two balls and no strikes. Cone
flung a fastball to the outside corner and Garciaparra reached out
and drove it down the right field line, high and deep; it was only
a question of whether it would be fair or foul. The Red Sox players
spilled out of the front of their dugout to see the ball better, to
see it . . . twist foul.
</P>
<P>
   Cone hunched his shoulders a bit and glanced back to catcher Joe
Girardi, the communication silent: Don't do that again. Cone fired
a fastball, belly-button high, and Garciaparra walloped it into the
screen that hangs over the left field wall.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees tied the score with a run in the fourth, and Cone
bore down _ more relaxed than he often is in big games, Girardi
said, loose in his delivery, his command exceptional, knowing
Martinez would be stingy, knowing he had to be.
</P>
<P>
   The playoffs don't start for another 21 days, and it isn't
possible for the Red Sox and Yankees to meet until the AL
Championship Series. Tuesday night, it was hard to tell.
</P>
<P>

MARTINEZ was on the mound. Fans with access to television began

HUNDLEY CONVINCES HIMSELF, IF NOT THE METS' MANAGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Todd Hundley arrived in the visitors' clubhouse
at Veterans Stadium on Tuesday not long after his Mets teammates
and was met with enthusiastic greetings and high-fives. But being
back with the team and actually feeling a part of it all are still
drastically different stories.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley was placed on the disabled list Aug. 28 with soreness in
his right elbow and began a rehabilitation assignment three days
later in Norfolk with the Mets' Class AAA affiliate. While at
Norfolk, he tested the surgically repaired elbow behind the plate
for the first time since Sept. 16, 1997, and affirmed his belief
that he can catch again.
</P>
<P>
   But his 18 innings of catcher's duty seemed to do little to
convince the Mets that they need to add him to the post-season
roster.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, when Mets manager Bobby Valentine was asked whether
Hundley's three home runs and .500 batting average in eight games
of rehabilitation were enough to force a return to the left-field
experiment for Hundley, he replied, ``No, I don't think so.''
Pressed, Valentine added: ``You make a post-season roster when you
make the post-season. But let's put it this way _ I don't think we
need a catcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley heard the comments, but chose discretion. He said that
he was certain that he would be activated when his 15-day stay on
the disabled list expires Saturday, but other than that, his fate
is in the Mets' hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ain't going there,'' Hundley said of Valentine's comments.
``I know I can catch, wherever. I had to go and find out. Now it
depends on what they want to do, how they want to work it. I don't
know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to help the team in any way I can, basically. That's
what it is. I'll do whatever he wants me to do. I want to help the
team get the wild card. That's the priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza has taken over the position that was Hundley's for
the last six years. Piazza, who will be a free agent at season's
end, has carried the team through the race while Hundley has
struggled to regain his form.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to be part of the team, want to be part of the
race,'' Hundley said. ``But you have to be smart about it. I can't
put into words how much you want to be a part of it. but we'll see
what happens. They'll do what the team's got to do. If they don't
put me on the playoff roster, that's what they've go to do. The
ball's in their court. I've got to be me, do my own thing.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the work behind the plate may not have convinced the Mets
that Hundley can help them this season, the short stay in Norfolk
did alleviate his own fears about the elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tells me I can catch,'' Hundley said. ``I threw a guy out.
That was for me to know I could catch, that I could throw, and that
the elbow could handle that kind of torque. I don't think I need
surgery at the end of the year. It served a lot of purposes for
me.''

VERMONT VOTE TURNS FICTION INTO A FACT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Living out a scenario almost exactly like the script of
the movie he starred in, Fred Tuttle, a 79-year-old retired dairy
farmer and late-blooming movie actor with a campaign budget of $16
or so, unexpectedly won the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate
in Vermont on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Which was a bit awkward, considering that Tuttle has announced
that though he is running, he has little desire to serve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither Fred nor I want to go to Washington,'' said John
O'Brien, Tuttle's campaign manager and the film maker who made him
famous. ``And Fred's wife definitely doesn't want to go to
Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there is little danger that Tuttle will win in
November against the solidly entrenched four-term Democrat, Sen.
Patrick Leahy. At one point, Tuttle had even said that he did not
plan to run against Leahy, but he said Tuesday night that he would
stay in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``After everybody's voted for me, how am I going to get out?''
he told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   With 79 percent of precincts reporting, Tuttle had 21,349 votes,
or 55 percent, while Jack McMullen had 17,363 votes, or 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Tuttle's point in running had been to urge the state to thumb
its nose at McMullen, a millionaire from Massachusetts who took up
legal residency in Vermont just over a year ago. Though he has had
a second home in Vermont for years, McMullen looked to some
Vermonters like the ultimate carpet-bagging flatlander in
comparison to Tuttle, who has lived his whole life on the same farm
in Tunbridge.
</P>
<P>
   Also, O'Brien readily acknowledged, Tuttle ran to help gain
publicity for the 1996 shoestring movie in which he stars, ``Man
With a Plan,'' which is offered on the central PBS menu this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The film features Tuttle as, well, pretty much himself, a
retired Vermont dairy farmer in overalls and thick glasses _ but
one who decides to run for the House of Representatives with the
idea that he has spent his whole life in the barn, and now just
wants ``to spend a little time in the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Through some Vermont synergy, however, Tuttle's movie fame and
political popularity have exploded. To the point, Leahy commented,
that when Tuttle marched in a Labor Day parade on Monday along with
other candidates, he was greeted as riotously as if he were a rock
star.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've voted in every election in Vermont since I was old enough
to vote, and I've never seen anything like this,'' Leahy, 58, said
in a telephone interview. ``I think people are saying, `Listen,
we're a small state but we take our own destiny and our politics
seriously, and don't treat us like we're some kind of theme park,
and if you've got a $2 million ticket you can come in and take any
ride you want.' ''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said Tuttle had support from a disparate coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, it's people who are so turned off by politics that
Fred in some ways is the `None of the above' candidate or the
ultimate anti-politician,'' he said. ``And other people say, `Jeez,
why not Fred Tuttle? He couldn't do any worse than the other people
there.' ''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien had said that if Tuttle won the primary, they would run
a positive campaign this fall aimed mainly at getting out the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be a campaign like America has never seen,'' he said.
``It'll be idea-based, and we have this secret Fred plan'' _ which
is secret mainly because it is not quite worked out yet, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Ready, a Democratic state senator from Addison County
and another supporter, said she thought, ``The message of Fred is
that Vermont is not for sale.''
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire's primary, which was also held Tuesday, Sen.
Judd Gregg, seeking his second term, easily defeated a Republican
primary challenge by state Rep. Phil Weber. He will face the
Democratic candidate, George Condodemetraky.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin defeated token opposition to be
nominated for a fourth term. Ed Garvey, a former leader of the pro
football players union, defeated state Sen. Gary George for the
Democratic nomination.

ACLU SUIT CHARGES L.A. WITH DISCRIMINATING AGAINST GIRLS' TEAMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ALEX ROTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Accusing Los Angeles city officials of sexism, the
American Civil Liberties Union announced plans Tuesday to expand
citywide a lawsuit charging girls' softball is treated as a
second-class sport.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU, which originally sued on behalf of the West Valley
Girls' Softball League, claims that girls do not have the same
access to other city-sponsored sports as do boys, in violation of
federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Parks department officials responded Tuesday that the ACLU was
making unreasonable demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The department has been working in good faith,'' Recreation
and Parks Commission President Steve Soboroff said, adding that
``there have been numerous packages offered'' to settle the suit.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU said it will ask a judge to grant class-action status
for a lawsuit it filed in April on behalf of the West Valley girls.
Officials said they want to expand the suit because the city
refused to address the league's complaint that it doesn't have a
permanent field despite years of asking.
</P>
<P>
   If allowed, the lawsuit would include all girls who want to play
softball or other sports in city leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have given the City Council six months to resolve this
litigation and they have spit in our face,'' said ACLU Legal
Director Mark Rosenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   City officials insisted they treat boys' and girls' sports
equally and have been working hard to settle the suit. Councilwoman
Laura Chick said the girls' league rejected several city offers to
find a place to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been offered a whole laundry list of locations,''
Chick said.
</P>
<P>
   ACLU officials said discrimination in sport programs is a
citywide problem. ACLU officials said that 22,511 youths play in
city baseball leagues while 1,905 girls play in softball leagues.
</P>
<P>
   City-sponsored girls' leagues ``typically are small in number
and represent only a tiny fraction of those of city-sponsored
baseball,'' ACLU staff attorney Rocio Cordoba said.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said the numbers reflect more interest in
baseball than softball.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of socioeconomic issues,'' said Jan Zatorski,
acting assistant general manager of the Recreation and Parks
department's Valley region. ``Some families direct their girls to
dance or drawing. Maybe it's what their mother did and that's what
they continue to do.''

COMMENTARY: OVER A BRIDGE, THE REAL LIFE OF NUEVA YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pichona Etlis and three friends traveled from
Argentina to New York for a quick getaway. They had already ridden
the double-decker tour buses for one of those quickie pseudosurveys
of the city. Downtown and uptown, they had shopped and dined,
walked and watched. It was all nice, but was it real? Something was
missing.
</P>
<P>
   Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The borough on the other side of the bridge was familiar to them
from the movies, usually as the setting for frantic
cops-and-robbers chases. They wanted to see it for themselves, if
only in pursuit of something that eludes those whose perception of
the city comes from popular culture or commerce. They wanted to see
real people.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things a tourist does not see,'' said Mrs. Etlis, a
music teacher in Buenos Aires. ``You want to see the inside of a
place, away from the classic places that everybody sees. If not,
you do not have real contact with the people.''
</P>
<P>
   The tourist boom that has resounded in the city this year
conjures the usual images of Rockefeller Center, Times Square and
the Twin Towers. But for visitors like Mrs. Etlis, there is a
curiosity about communities that can seem as incomprehensible as a
subway map. Luckily, she and her friends had Lillian Serje, a guide
who untangled not only the maps, but also the streets. Ms. Serje is
a volunteer with Big Apple Greeter, a nonprofit group that provides
visitors with a native guide to the lesser-known mysteries of the
metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Serje is passionate about recognizing the neighborhoods
where real life thrives. She is grateful to the city, where she
arrived nine years ago with no job. She now runs a housecleaning
service. And her volunteer work has finally given her a chance to
put to use the skills she learned in her native Colombia, where she
once was the sales director at a Bogota hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have gone well for me here, and I have a moral debt to
repay to New York,'' she said. ``Tourists think that people here
are hostile and that you have to be scared. But New Yorkers love to
show off what they know about this city. You just have to ask
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was her pride that led her to call the courthouse in
Downtown Brooklyn ``the palace of justice.'' The Argentines nodded
solemnly as they proceeded down a side street in Brooklyn Heights,
where they stopped to appreciate the brownstones and wonder why
they had stoops in front. They were told how people socialize on
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Spain, you go to a restaurant after work and have an
aperitif,'' said Laura Barnatan, a textile factory owner. ``It is a
custom.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Serje lured them on with the promise of a surprise. The
Argentines followed, their gazes growing wide when they saw the
vista of Manhattan unfold before them along the Promenade. They sat
on the benches, each one debating over which home they would buy
along the scenic strip.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dutch settlers had a vision,'' said Elsa Cauchaner, who
owns a uniform business in Buenos Aires. ``They bought Manhattan
for $24. I would have given 25. And now it's priceless.''
</P>
<P>
   She noticed three women sitting nearby, also chatting in
Spanish. Mrs. Cauchaner approached one, and within minutes she had
gleaned her life story: how she moved to New York at a young age
from Spain, worked two jobs to support two adopted sons, how she
now lived in a middle-income high-rise with a balcony view of lower
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw her sitting there in such good spirits,'' Mrs. Cauchaner
said later. ``I asked her if she was always like that. She said you
had to work hard to reach this state of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion of peace of mind in Brooklyn surprised the tourists,
who walked away from the Promenade convinced they had stumbled on
an undiscovered corner of tranquillity. From what they had seen on
television, they thought they'd only see chaos, rundown homes and
unhappy people.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see police in cars chasing somebody,'' said Rosita
Stronguin, a retired gift shop owner. ``Sometimes you see nice
things like Tiffany's, but really all you usually see is violence.
I imagine your television is pretty bad. I do not know how real
that is. But that is what we get.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Serje guided them back to Manhattan, where they shared a
lunch at South Street Seaport. They looked back to Brooklyn, then
huddled together for a snapshot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Nueva York,'' Mrs. Stronguin concluded. ``Viva Nueva
York. Anybody who criticizes it is only jealous.''

 &HT;    Handle designer lenses with care, Texans told
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ State health and law enforcement officials are
warning Texans about the dangers of improper use of designer
contact lenses.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Mills, contact lens program administrator for the Texas
Department of Health, on Tuesday said state health officials have
received about a dozen reports of eye infections and injuries in
junior high and high school students caused by wearing fashion
contact lenses. The designer lenses, some of which are being
marketed to children, include bull's-eye and cat's-eye designs,
starbursts, other patterns and colors.
</P>
<P>
   Mills said there's nothing wrong with the contacts, but the
plastic lenses must be prescribed and properly fitted for the
person wearing them. Mills also said contact lenses should never be
shared, a trend that has been reported in some schools.
</P>
<P>
   All of the reported injuries and infections have involved cases
in which doctors were able to correct the problems, Mills said. He
added, however, that in worst-case scenarios, the infections or
injuries could lead to blindness or the loss of an eye.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries or infections have been reported among students in
the Austin Independent School District, and health officials at the
Round Rock and San Marcos school districts said they were unaware
of any cases. Central Texas school officials and students said they
were aware of the lenses but had not heard of any problems
associated with them.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen-year-old Marshall Berliner said it's impossible to miss
the contacts on the McCallum High School campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of think they are cool,'' Berliner said. ``Sometimes
(students) have different-colored eyes. One day they'll wear
purple, and then another day yellow, but I don't know if they
swap.''
</P>
<P>
   Judy Frederick, head of student health at the Austin school
district, said the district is providing information to school
nurses to warn students about misuse of the contacts.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Dusek, a spokesman for Attorney General Dan Morales, said
there have been reports of the fashion lenses being sold at flea
markets and other businesses not licensed to dispense contact
lenses. Dusek said no enforcement action has been started against
any businesses but added that lawsuits would be filed if unlicensed
companies don't stop selling the lenses.
</P>
<P>
   Mills said he's received reports of a flea market dealer in
Austin selling the lenses. Other nonlicensed sources have included
home-based sales, door-to-door handbills and shopper-type
publications, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're requesting school districts not accept these
advertisements without a license number,'' Mills said. ``We'd
really like to see papers of any kind requesting that
information.''
</P>
<P>
   Dusek said the attorney general's office will take whatever
steps necessary to prevent injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our objective is to put a stop to this right now,'' he said.
``If this persists, we'll have to take legal action.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Dugas, of EyeCare Vision Center on Martin Luther King
Jr. Boulevard, said tinted lenses have been available for some time
with little problem. He added, though, that the introduction of
designer lenses with various patterns has raised concerns.
</P>
<P>
   When prescribing the lenses, he said, ``we try to make it clear
that these are yours.''

 &HT;    Minority enrollment growing in suburbs
 &HT;    By A. Phillips Brooks
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Minority students increasingly have moved from
big-city schools to suburban campuses in the past decade, according
to a report released Tuesday by the Texas Education Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The trend took some state officials by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really caught our eye,'' said Debbie Graves Ratcliffe, a
spokeswoman for the agency. ``I think it may be that more
minorities are entering the middle class and following the middle
class to the suburbs.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also found that Central Texas schools are growing
faster than others in the state. Enrollment in public schools in
Region 13, which includes Travis, Williamson, Hays and Bastrop
counties, increased 37 percent from 1987-88 to 1997-98, the agency
found.
</P>
<P>
   The report noted that African American, Hispanic and Asian
students made up 55 percent of Texas' 3.9 million schoolchildren in
the 1997-98 school year, compared with 45 percent of white
students.
</P>
<P>
   Central Texas school officials _ who are grappling with rapid
growth and demographic shifts _ say they are not surprised by those
trends, which they say are fueled by minority parents' desire for
better schools, safer communities and affordable homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our minority parents want the same thing Anglo parents do,''
said Robert Spoonemore, superintendent of the Pflugerville
Independent School District. ``They want a home that meets the
American dream and good schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, the German settlement north of Austin was
virtually all-white. The district had two elementary schools, one
junior high and a high school.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the district is on the verge of being a ``majority
minority'' district in which blacks, Hispanics and Asians combined
will be a majority of the enrollment. The district now has 16
schools, including two high schools. Two more schools are in the
works.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a total shock to some people, but we may be a majority
minority this fall when the numbers are in,'' Spoonemore said.
</P>
<P>
   Rapid growth has stressed school resources and the district's
budget. Nearly a third of school taxes are financing new schools.
Spoonemore said the district has set up a bilingual program for its
Spanish-speaking students. Pflugerville, he said, needs a similar
bilingual program for its Vietnamese-speaking students but has not
yet found a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Leander schools also are feeling growing pains from rapid
growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll break ground in the next two to three weeks for a new
elementary school,'' said Bill Britcher, a spokesman for the
Leander district, whose student population increased by about 60
percent in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   One month later, the district will begin building a new middle
school, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Britcher said good schools and undeveloped lots that sell for
prices hard to find in Austin are the reasons for rapid growth.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic students, once too small a percentage of the student
body to meet the threshold required by the state for tracking and
testing purposes, make up more than 12 percent of Leander's
enrollment this fall, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Round Rock, a booming high-tech industry has lured residents
from California and other states, said Mike Jolly, interim
superintendent for the Round Rock Independent School District.
Growth has been mostly in white students, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The education agency report also found:
</P>
<P>
   Economically disadvantaged students made up the fastest-growing
segment of Texas students, increasing 65 percent. Economically
disadvantaged students also made up a majority in two-thirds of all
urban school districts in 1997-98, up from 47 percent a decade
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   African American students were the most likely to move to the
suburbs. Ten years ago, 42 percent of black students attended urban
schools and 18 percent attended suburban schools. Today, 35 percent
of African American students attend urban schools, while 28 percent
attend suburban schools.

BIG METROPOLIS ON CAMPUS: THE SIREN SONG OF NEW YORK CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This city hardly fits the usual image of College
Town, U.S.A. And higher education will never dominate the local
culture and economy the way it does in, say, Boston or Ann Arbor,
Mich. But increasingly, New York is becoming the college
applicant's destination of choice.
</P>
<P>
   During the last five years, with financial and media businesses
booming, crime plunging and the city re-emerging as the place to
be, admissions offices say high school students have been applying
to New York's colleges and universities in record numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn by the city's glitter, its activity and its range of jobs
and internships, they have been inundating the admissions offices
at the big elite universities like Columbia and New York University
as well as smaller regional schools like Pace and Marymount
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York City is bigger, more exciting, special, wild and
crazy,'' Gosia Rymsza-Pawlowska, a first-year student from
Washington, said excitedly as she stood on a Broadway sidewalk the
other day, waiting for a cart so she could move her luggage into
her new dormitory at Barnard College.
</P>
<P>
   While college applications nationwide have risen slowly _ they
grew an average of 11 percent per college at four-year colleges
between 1991 and 1996, according to the College Board _ colleges in
New York City say their increase has been considerably steeper.
</P>
<P>
   This soaring demand, in turn, has allowed the colleges to
burnish their images. The more applications they get, the more
selective they can be, allowing them to admit better students and
raising their rankings in rating guides like those of U.S. News &AMP;
World Report.
</P>
<P>
   New York University has seen applications rise 145 percent since
1991, to 24,500. Fordham, which has campuses in the Bronx and
Manhattan, has seen applications double in the same period, to
7,621.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia University's applications have risen 81 percent in the
last five years, to 12,251 for a freshman class of 955 at Columbia
College. Even though Columbia has expanded its freshman class by
110 over the past decade, the growth in applications has lowered
its acceptance rate to 14 percent, which Columbia officials say
makes it the third most selective college in the Ivy League, after
Harvard and Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think a lot of this is because of the excellence in the
programs we offer,'' said Columbia president George Rupp. ``But we
know that a major ingredient is that New York is viewed as a hot
town and a great place to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Surging applications, 3,841 for a class of 549, have also
transformed Barnard into the country's most popular women's
college, said president Judith Shapiro, who also cited the city as
a factor. ``Students enter the gates, and it really is a
community,'' she said. ``But they walk outside, and all of New York
is there.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Pace University's New York campus and Marymount
Manhattan have both seen applications rise 64 percent in five
years. At the Juilliard School, spokeswoman Janet Kessin said that
while applications to other conservatories around the country have
peaked after years of growth, Juilliard's applications have
continued to climb.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of applications and new students are from out
of town, forcing some universities to scramble for dormitory space
and turning others from commuter colleges into residential ones.
Marymount, once a commuter school on the Upper East Side, now draws
a quarter of its students from outside the city and has had to rent
space on Roosevelt Island and in Brooklyn. St. John's University in
Queens has received more than 7,000 inquiries from around the
country since it announced plans to build dormitories just a few
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   New York is unlikely to become a classic college town, but
education officials say no other city matches it when it comes to
the number of colleges (about 100 within the five boroughs) or
students (half a million). The City University of New York alone
has 200,000 students on its 21 campuses, while the Commission on
Independent Colleges and Universities, a trade association of
private colleges in New York State, says its 39 member colleges in
New York City have about 163,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   Students say they are drawn by the reputations and the
particular offerings of the colleges they apply to: the dance
programs at NYU or Barnard, for example, or the core curriculum at
Columbia. But like Glenn Shor, a freshman from Coral Springs, Fla.,
who just started at NYU's Stern School of Business, nearly all say
the city was a crucial factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York City was probably like the biggest thing for me in
choosing a college,'' Shor said this week as he waited in the Loeb
Student Center for a briefing on jobs and internships, a thick
black planner clutched in his hand. ``I grew up in the suburbs, but
there are so many opportunities here. You can't get much closer to
Wall Street. I want to end up there eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   Students attending colleges in Manhattan are not the only ones
who point to the city's lure. Garrett Sidmore, 18, a freshman from
Danvers, Mass., at Manhattan College in the Bronx, said he chose
New York over business schools closer to home because ``everything
is out there, connections.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be easier for me to visit the businesses in the city,''
he said, ``to get the internships, the jobs, meet the people and
network that I need to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   While job opportunities are a huge draw, another is the arts and
theater, both for aspiring performers and for those who simply want
to watch. Nahede Khosrovi, 17, a freshman in the new Fordham-Alvin
Ailey program, said she had found few comparable programs elsewhere
that would have allowed her to pursue her goal of becoming a dancer
while taking high-quality academic courses.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone understands New York's lure. Nina Narelle, 23, a
freshman at Eugene Lang College at the New School, said that when
she told her friends in Oregon that she was headed for New York,
``they wrinkled up their faces in revulsion.''
</P>
<P>
   But she can't get enough of the city. An environmentalist used
to spending lots of time in forests, in the two weeks since she
arrived, she has explored Central Park, visited the Whitney Museum
of American Art, and ridden a bike from 97th Street to 10th Street
and back, yelling, ``Watch out, buddy,'' at cabbies who came too
close.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows me to step out of myself,'' she said. ``I've gotten
lost a lot, but I'm having a fabulous time.''
</P>
<P>
   College officials say students in New York can receive an
education unlike what they would get anywhere else, and colleges
are increasingly setting up courses and internships that focus on
the city and its cultural and business institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia University has created a program called Passport to New
York, in which students have free access not only to about 15
institutions, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the
Brooklyn Academy of Music, but also to paid internships at these
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan College, offers a series of classes known as site
courses, in which 30 percent of the class time is spent in the
city. They range from Skyscraper Architecture to In the Trenches of
Wall Street to Theater in the City: Drama and Performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New York City theater is our campus,'' said Mary Ann
O'Donnell, a professor of English and dean of the School of the
Arts. ``Students attend performances. That's their textbook.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always had groups of culture vultures,'' she said. ``But
now the city is vibrant. And for those who view it from other
places, it's perceived as safe once again. It's perceived as the
place to be. They are studying abroad in New York.''

ABBOTT &AMP; COSTELLO, TRACY &AMP; HEPBURN, FOLEY &AMP; JOHNSON? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York Jets coach Bill Parcells will wring his hands this
week, complain about a defense that collapsed in overtime against
the San Francisco 49ers and growl about facing a Baltimore Ravens
team Sunday that crushed his team by 33-0 in the preseason. But
Jets fans can take heart from that crushing loss to San Francisco:
Glenn Foley and Keyshawn Johnson have found each other.
</P>
<P>
   They combined on 9 receptions for 2 touchdowns and 126 yards
against a 49er secondary that gave Johnson a cushion lest he break
free and turn a 10-yard pass into a touchdown. That was the
explosive combination the Jets had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   _ Foley leads the National Football League with 415 passing
yards.
</P>
<P>
   _ Johnson is tied for the league lead with two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   _ Foley leads the American Football Conference with three
touchdown passes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Johnson is tied for the conference lead with nine receptions.
</P>
<P>
   These are two guys with attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Foley wants Johnson to do great things. ``He's a weapon, and I'm
going to use him,'' Foley said last spring after being anointed the
starting quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   And after combining so often with Johnson last Sunday, Foley
said: ``Keyshawn's a great player, and I can expect him to have
more games like this. This was a career game for him and he is only
going to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Johnson, he describes Foley as ``a football player.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson likes the way that Foley gets in the huddle and gives
orders. And perhaps most of all, he likes the way Foley looks for
him.
</P>
<P>
   They first hooked up in 1996, when Foley started his first game
in Game 13 against New England. He found the rookie Johnson 7 times
for 91 yards, and a touchdown. The next week, against the Eagles,
Johnson snared 4 passes for 77 yards and a touchdown. In the final
game that closed a 1-15 season, Johnson caught 2 more passes for 32
yards before Foley left the game.
</P>
<P>
   So in Foley's three starts in 1996, Johnson caught 2 of his 8
touchdowns, caught 13 of his 63 passes and gained 200 of his 844
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, their rapport was just as good, and immediate.
Foley made his first appearance by replacing Neil O'Donnell midway
through the second game with the Patriots. O'Donnell had failed to
connect with Johnson. But in the second half, Foley found Johnson 4
times for 66 yards. The next week Foley again relieved O'Donnell
and spotted Johnson once for 21 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Foley was named the starter, against Miami, and the
pair hooked up for 6 receptions and 79 yards. Then, against
Chicago, Foley completed only one pass before sustaining a
season-ending knee injury _ it was a 35-yard touchdown pass to
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the two players should be busy against the Ravens.
Baltimore held the Steelers' Jerome Bettis to a 1.8-yard rushing
average. He could gain only 41 yards on 23 attempts. If the Ravens
can keep Curtis Martin anywhere close to those numbers, the Johnson
and Foley show will be unveiled again.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the Jets do not have to pass, even if they produce
an effective running game, it appears that Johnson and Foley have
become a major part of just who the Jets are these days.
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   _ JUMBO ELLIOTT's driver's license was suspended for 90 days,
and he was fined $375, after pleading guilty yesterday to charges
of driving while impaired and unsafe lane changing. In addition,
ruled Judge George Peck of the Nassau County District Court in
Hempstead, N.Y., Elliott, the Jets' left tackle, must complete the
NFL's substance-abuse program. The license suspension was automatic
because Elliott refused a breath test when he was arrested at 5:05
a.m. Aug. 30.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach BILL PARCELLS has complained about poor run-blocking
against the 49ers. But it has been a long summer for running back
CURTIS MARTIN. Against the 49ers, he got no yardage, or negative
yardage, on 6 of 22 rushes. In the second half, he ran on first
down three times for a total of 6 yards. He gained 58 yards over
all.
</P>
<P>
   _ The rookie punter NICK GALLERY is last in the conference in
both gross yards (39.7) and in net yards (33.3).

NOT 62, BUT PHILS GET ENOUGH HOMERS TO SINK METS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ While readying for the bottom of the seventh
inning Tuesday night, the New York Mets' players took their
positions, and then, just like all the fans at Veterans' Stadium,
they turned toward center field and watched on the video screen as
it displayed Mark McGwire's historic 62nd home run. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The pose was not unfamiliar to the Mets' fielders. They had
spent most of the night with their heads whipping around to watch
home runs clear the fences. And two batters after they saw McGwire
connect, Bobby Estalella redirected their attention to the spot,
driving a Mel Rojas pitch over the fence for the Phillies' sixth
home run of the game. Two batters later, Marlon Anderson, in his
first major league at-bat, crushed a two-run blast into the
Phillies' bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Not quite 62 home runs, but the Phillies' display of clout was
more than enough to satisfy the 18,661 fans who chose to watch
these two teams duel rather than watch McGwire on television, and
enough to hand the Mets a humbling 16-4 defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just put this night past you,'' Tony Phillips said. ``You
don't even evaluate games like this.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza added, ``These things happen.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The loss may have taken the bravado out of the Mets after they
won three of four games from the Atlanta Braves and moved into a
tie with the Chicago Cubs in the race for the National League's
wild card berth. But some of the Mets slumped onto a sofa in the
clubhouse afterward and were relieved to see that McGwire and his
St. Louis Cardinal teammates had taken the lead on the Cubs,
holding on for a 6-3 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday had nothing to do with today,'' Mets manager Bobby
Valentine said. ``And today, hopefully, will have nothing to do
with tomorrow.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The seven home runs were a club record for the Phillies and
matched a Mets' record for futility that dated back to 1967, when
they surrendered seven homers at Chicago on July 11.
</P>
<P>
   Rojas gave up three of the home runs on this night, but he was
hardly to blame for the defeat. Before Rojas entered, this game was
headed toward disaster. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hideo Nomo started for the Mets and surrendered singles to the
first three batters, with two of them coming around to score. The
third man, Scott Rolen, didn't score thanks to a nice throw from
Piazza to Nomo after a wild pitch. Rico Brogna then followed with
the first homer of the night, a solo blast that made it 3-0. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nomo gave up a solo home run to Kevin Sefcik in the third
inning. He surrendered a walk, a run-scoring double and an
intentional walk before Valentine summoned Willie Blair from the
bullpen. Blair's third pitch was blasted into the left field seats
by Estalella for a three-run homer and an 8-0 Phillies lead. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since pitching a three-hitter in San Francisco on Aug. 26, Nomo
has dropped two consecutive decisions, lasting only four innings
and surrendering five runs in his previous start, and being roughed
up for seven runs in just two and two-thirds innings Tuesday night.
Nomo has failed to pitch more than five innings in six of his last
eight starts.
</P>
<P>
   He will start Monday in Houston, but then is likely to be out of
the rotation as the starting six is expected to dwindle to a
four-man rotation for the final weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``My location was no good today at all,'' Nomo said. ``I don't
know why. Pitches in the middle of the zone were being hit. I don't
know how much more you can say. It was what it was. It is
frustrating.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Valentine said, ``He tried to sneak his fastball by them and he
just wasn't able to do that.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brad Clontz, who followed Nomo to the mound, surrendered
Brogna's second home run. Rojas then gave up Sefcik's second homer
of the game, one more than the Phillies' left fielder had in his
career entering the night. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Mets did go deep twice themselves, with Edgardo Alfonzo
hitting his 17th home run and Jermaine Allensworth adding his
fifth. But by the sixth inning, Valentine was emptying the bench
and resting his starters.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   The 16 runs were the most surrendered by the Mets this season,
topping a 15-run effort by the Toronto Blue Jays on July 1.
</P>
<P>
   _ Thieves hit the Mets' locker room before the game, making off
with a television and video-cassette recorder and game jerseys of
BRIAN MCRAE and BOBBY VALENTINE.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Mets' third base coach COOKIE ROJAS underwent tests in New
York because of a 104-degree temperature but joined the team in
time for the game.
</P>
<P>
   _ Before the game, the Mets brought up four players from their
Class AAA affiliate, Norfolk, which ended its season Monday. In
addition to Todd Hundley, who was named the International League's
Player of the Week, the club recalled right-handed pitcher Octavio
Dotel, catcher Vance Wilson, and purchased the contract of
infielder Todd Haney. Wilson was then placed on the 60-day disabled
list. He will have surgery performed at the Hospital for Special
Surgery next week to put a plate in his right forearm to help a
fracture heal. Wilson will be in a cast for six to eight weeks. &QL;

LAUSD ENGLISH IMMERSION IN FULL SWING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY YVETTE CABRERA  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Erwin Street School teacher Amy D'Elia speaks
Spanish fluently, but Tuesday morning as the first day of classes
began, she didn't speak a word of Spanish to her all-Latino
second-grade class.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the only time she spoke in Spanish was when a student's
mother dropped by to ask when school would let out.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's our big, big rule?'' D'Elia asked her 17
second-graders, seated cross-legged on Room 9's rainbow-colored
carpet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Follow directions the first time,'' 17 voices chimed back in
unison. Just last year, this same group of students was taught in a
bilingual class.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday they and thousands of other Los Angeles Unified
School District students returned to school to be taught under the
new sheltered English immersion program _ required by Proposition
227 to replace bilingual education.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, 64 year-round district schools began English
immersion, while 473 campuses in the district starting Tuesday
began offering classes as needed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite much debate over the implementation of the program, on
Tuesday the transition was smooth at Erwin Street School, serving
kindergarten through sixth grade. Last year, 57 percent of the
school's children were limited-English-proficiency students.
</P>
<P>
   School officials will meet Wednesday with parents to let them
know they can use waivers to place their children back in bilingual
classes, but must wait to do so until after a 30-day &UR;  &LR; trial period
for the English immersion program.
</P>
<P>
   Erwin Street School officials don't expect to receive many
waiver requests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our parents really do want English instruction now,''
said Alan Lewis, the school's English immersion coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Schools are offering two forms of English immersion. With Model
A, the teacher and students speak English as the primary language.
Model B allows the teachers to use the students' primary language,
but it must be tied to the lesson being taught.
</P>
<P>
   D'Elia's class is a Model B class, but because her students have
mastered conversational English, she was able to take care of
orientation entirely in English.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first day and some of them are shy, but I can just
tell they are advanced,'' D'Elia said. ``Some of them are reading
things that are pretty advanced.''
</P>
<P>
   There were times when the students spoke Spanish, but it was
among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   English instruction is something parents desire for their
children, D'Elia said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I already had a parent ask me this morning, You're going to do
English, right?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While conversational English is easy for children to grasp,
subjects such as science and social studies are tougher and will
require D'Elia to preview and review in Spanish, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Working with Lewis, the teachers will learn as they go and
tailor the program to fit the needs of the students, D'Elia said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like whatever we do, I want what's best for the
children, so they're not behind and have equal opportunities,'' she
said.

GIANTS UNITED AGAINST COMMON ENEMY: ARTIFICIAL TURF 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ There were bandages everywhere in the
Giants' locker room Monday morning. Big, thick white gauze wrapped
around broad biceps and elastic dressings on puffy elbows, wrists
and hands. Sunday, after all, had brought a tough game against the
Giants' oldest rival, the Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   But the most common injury was the result of contact with the
real bane of the players at Giants Stadium: the artificial playing
surface.
</P>
<P>
   Turf burn is the stinging, pernicious hazard of professional
football players who chase and collide with each other at high
speeds on an abrasive outdoor carpet.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the most serious injury players link to artificial
turf _ that would be ligament damage and concussions _ but after a
game, turf burn is the most universal, a readily apparent and
repulsive wound found at every third locker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the sideline and it felt like somebody was holding a
match to my arm,'' Giants defensive end Chad Bratzke said Monday.
``I looked at my arm and realized it was turf burn. The skin was
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   From the top of Bratzke's shoulder to the knob of his left
elbow, a layer or two of skin was missing from his arm. It is a big
arm, a biceps of maybe 19 inches. It was a big burn.
</P>
<P>
   Across the room, safety Tito Wooten held up his forearm. There
was a blood-red swath several inches wide from his wrist to his
elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you hear screaming coming from the showers in a couple
minutes,'' Wooten said, ``you will know that's me in there and the
water has hit my turf burn.''
</P>
<P>
   Turf burn at Giants Stadium was probably more epidemic over the
weekend for two reasons: It is a new turf, which usually means
better traction for shoes and skin, and it was an extremely hot
day.
</P>
<P>
   For most games, players will try to cover as much of their
bodies as they can, using long-sleeved T-shirts, elbow pads and
gloves to avoid direct contact with the turf. But artificial turf
radiates heat. Stand on the sideline and look across to the other
side and you will see the heat rise off it, like a highway on a
summer day.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's temperatures were in the high 80s. Television
broadcasters said during the game that the temperature on the
artificial surface had reached 120 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   So players had shed much of the protective clothing they might
usually wear on a nongrass field. And they paid for it later.
</P>
<P>
   Some paid for it during the game. Giants wide receiver Ike
Hilliard missed part of the game with what Giants trainers called
``sore feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilliard put his feet in ice for 10 or 15 minutes, and once they
cooled down, he returned. Call this a variation on an injury
sustained only during games on artificial turf, one aptly named
``turf toe.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' disgust with the artificial turf was more apparent
this week because the team had played two preseason games on a
highly popular experimental grass field last month. The grass field
was removed Aug. 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came through the tunnel and that grass was the most
beautiful thing I'd ever seen here,'' running back Tiki Barber
said. ``Of course, I'd rather play on mud, dirt, sand. Anything
than that turf.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   John Mara, the Giants' executive vice president, has expressed
his support of a grass field at Giants Stadium, though he
acknowledges that there are some logistical problems given all the
use the stadium gets. But Mara would like to see the grass field
installed permanently by next football season.
</P>
<P>
   The makers of artificial turf, and even some of its critics, say
there is no medical proof that the surface causes the serious knee
and head injuries most players have come to associate with it. It's
an unfounded prejudice, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Football is such a violent game that there is no definitive way
to identify and corroborate the exact factors in any injury.
Proving that artificial turf is dangerous may be impossible.
</P>
<P>
   It is also unimportant.
</P>
<P>
   The work force in football, a group that ownership pays an
average annual salary in excess of $1 million, despises the stuff,
and not just because it leaves hunks of its skin on it every game.
</P>
<P>
   The players are thoroughly convinced that it causes injuries,
and they say it makes their joints ache for days after playing
games on it. The distaste for artificial turf is so pervasive among
the players that forward-thinking teams have torn up their
artificial turf and replaced it with grass because the teams know
it makes them more attractive to free agents perusing the league
for a new home.
</P>
<P>
   What more does anyone, and that includes ownership in the
National Football League, need to know about these phony fields?
</P>
<P>
   Artificial turf is too unforgiving for football _ too hard, too
hot, too abrasive. Besides, if nothing else, it is out of place.
What outdoor sport isn't better on a natural surface?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait for them to tear that turf up,'' said Barber, who
blames the Giants Stadium turf for a midseason knee injury in 1997.
``Shoot, I'll help them tear it up. It'll give me a chance to get
even.''

MCCAUGHEY ROSS ASSAILS VALLONE, CHIEF PARTY RIVAL, IN TV DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The most heated exchange yet in the race for the
Democratic gubernatorial nomination came Tuesday night in a
televised debate, as Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross went on the
offensive against her chief rival, New York City Council Speaker
Peter Vallone, blaming him for the ills of the city's public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter often says that he has experience money can't buy, but
we have paid for it with crumbling schools and low reading
scores,'' said Ms. McCaughey Ross, who had refrained from attacking
the other three candidates in past debates.
</P>
<P>
   As he has throughout the campaign, Vallone responded by
questioning the lieutenant governor's commitment to the Democratic
Party. She became a Democrat just last year, after a long feud with
her onetime mentor, Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Her assault on Vallone, which began with her opening statement,
seemed a clear acknowledgment that he has opened a lead in recent
opinion polls, and that something was needed to inject life into
her badly flagging campaign with just a week left until Tuesday's
primary. Her campaign revealed its first television ads Tuesday,
which are to be shown Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the primary will run in the November election
against Pataki, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone, who has strived to appear above the fray in this
contest, did not attempt to defend himself against Ms. McCaughey
Ross' charges in the debate on the cable television channel New
York 1, broadcast live from its studios at 42nd Street and 10th
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   But his aides quickly pointed out that the City Council has
never had any direct influence over the schools system; for
instance, it has no role in selecting the Board of Education or the
schools chancellor. They argued that Vallone has taken the lead in
providing more financing for schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all ridiculous, and if she knew anything about the school
system, she would know that,'' Kevin McCabe, Vallone's campaign
manager, said.
</P>
<P>
   As in three past televised confrontations, the other three
candidates _ Vallone; Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes and
James Larocca, a former state transportation commissioner _
criticized Ms. McCaughey Ross, who was once widely seen as the
front-runner. In particular, they attacked her for accepting the
Liberal Party nomination and pledging to campaign in the general
election on that line even if she loses the Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   In meetings late last year, ``All four of us gave our word to
Democratic leaders at the time that we were Democrats and we would
not do that,'' Vallone said.
</P>
<P>
   Larocca, turning to the lieutenant governor, said: ``You will be
aiding and abetting the re-election of George Pataki if you stay on
the Liberal line and run against the winner of this primary. But
I'm not surprised. You've changed your parties, you've changed your
positions more times than I can keep count of.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCaughey Ross painted her party switch as one of idealism,
not an act of convenience after a feud with the governor. ``I made
a tough decision,'' she said. ``I didn't just go along to get
along. I made the decision to put my principles ahead of party and
to change parties.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Sunday, after the last debate, Ms. McCaughey Ross said she
had consciously sworn off assaults on the other candidates, adding,
``People don't want to hear attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, she was on the offensive from the beginning,
devoting more of her opening statement to Vallone's shortcomings on
education than to her own record. She said repeatedly that Vallone
had been a councilman for 25 years, reminding viewers that he is a
career politician, stressing the contrast with her own short career
in public life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing personal,'' she said, ``but Peter Vallone waited 25
years and then ran ads about his commitment to improving public
education. Peter Vallone has 25 years' experience as a politician
making the same old promises.''
</P>
<P>
   When each of the candidates was given a chance to ask a rival a
question, Ms. McCaughey Ross, trying to embarrass Vallone by making
him appear uninformed, asked if he knew what percentage of high
school graduates obtained a Regents diploma. He said 27 percent,
and she quickly corrected him, saying that it is 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone laughed and said, ``I was pretty close.''
</P>
<P>
   Larocca, whose remarks were the most stinging of the night,
turned his sights at one point on Hynes, who has made much of being
the only candidate to oppose the death penalty, and to promise to
overturn it. Hynes is also the only prosecutor in the state to have
obtained a capital punishment verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't quite see, Joe, how you can have it both ways,''
Larocca said, using Hynes' nickname.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, Vallone, Larocca and Hynes kept the cozy
tone that has characterized their statements about one another.
Given a chance to ask questions of their opponents, they did not
hit hard. The other two noted their support of Vallone's positions
more often than they took issue with them.
</P>
<P>
   Hynes and Larocca argued that Vallone, as the most successful
fund-raiser of the four, would be least able to make the case for
campaign finance reform. But in the next breath, Hynes agreed, as
he often argues, that the New York City campaign finance law that
Vallone helped create is one of the country's finest.
</P>
<P>
   Larocca defended Vallone's proposed referendum on whether to
build the Yankees a new stadium in Manhattan. ``What the speaker
has done,'' he said, ``is give the people of the city of New York a
direct opportunity to state their case, and I commend him.''
</P>
<P>
   Hynes quipped, ``I wish we'd get off this topic, because it's
only helping Peter in the polls.''

<P>
   The method, developed by the Genetics &AMP; IVF Institute in
Fairfax, Va., involves sorting sperm by the amount of DNA they
contain and then using them for artificial insemination. It
capitalizes on the fact that there is only one difference between
sperm that carry the Y chromosome, which produces males, and those
with an X-chromosome, which produces females: sperm with a Y
chromosome have about 2.8 percent less genetic material.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators report that if they select for X-bearing
sperm, they end up with sperm samples in which 85 percent of the
cells have an X-chromosome. If they select for Y-bearing sperm, the
result is a sperm sample in which 65 percent of the cells contain a
Y-chromosome.
</P>
<P>
   In a paper being published on Wednesday in the journal Human
Reproduction, the investigators, led by Dr. Edward Fugger, report
results for couples who wanted girls. Of 14 pregnancies that
progressed far enough for doctors to determine the fetus' sex, 13
had only female fetuses. Ten out of the 11 babies that were born so
far were girls.
</P>
<P>
   Fugger said that the group has produced about the same number of
pregnancies for couples who wanted boys and that the results are
consistent with what the sperm sorting would predict. But, he said,
the investigators are not releasing the results of those
pregnancies until they are published in a medical journal.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, sex selection techniques have been promoted and
marketed for decades. But, said Dr. Alan DeCherney, the chairman of
obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California at Los
Angeles and the editor of the journal Fertility and Sterility,
``Nothing worked until now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Genetics &AMP; IVF Institute, a private, for-profit medical
center, is a leader in fertility research and prides itself in
being among the first to offer new reproductive techniques. Fugger
noted that before his group began using the sperm sorting
technique, hundreds of animals of a variety of species had been
born using the method and that there was no evidence that it caused
birth defects. But other fertility experts raised questions about
the ethical quandaries opened up with a decision to provide sex
selection and whether the animal tests were adequate to show safety
to humans.
</P>
<P>
   Sex selection has been used for millennia, with folk remedies
that supposedly guaranteed a baby of a particular sex, female
infanticide and, more recently, the abortion of fetuses because of
their gender.
</P>
<P>
   Decade after decade, so many groups have claimed that they had a
method for sex selection that the entire field became tainted, said
Dr. Richard Rawlins, the director of the in vitro fertilization
laboratories at Rush University in Chicago. Most recently, claims
that male sperm could be separated because they swim faster were
found to be without scientific basis.
</P>
<P>
   To sift sperm, researchers at the Genetics &AMP; IVF Institute
stained their DNA and then used a cell sorter that lined up sperm
individually in a stream, where each sperm's DNA content was
measured and the X-containing sperm separated from those with a
Y-chromosome. The scientists said it takes most of a day to sort
the approximately 200 million wriggling sperm of a single ejaculate
as they pass single file through the machine's DNA detector.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joseph Schulman, director of the Genetics &AMP; IVF Institute,
said most of the couples wanted to choose their baby's sex for
``family balancing.'' A few wanted sex selection because they were
at risk of having babies with genetic diseases that afflict boys
almost exclusively, he said. Schulman said that, so far, the
institute was not offering the method to couples who have no
children and want a first child of a particular sex, but he did not
rule out that use in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Monique Collins of Gainesville, Va., was one of the first to
have sperm sorting, in March 1995. She had two sons, who were aged
2 and 6, and urgently wanted a daughter. ``Having a daughter for me
was like having a baby for some people, that's how important it
was,'' she said. She and her husband, Scott Collins, had a girl on
Aug. 13, 1996, after Collins' sperm was sorted at the institute.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia researchers are using a technique whose development
began 16 years ago, when Dr. Lawrence Johnson, a scientist at the
Department of Agriculture's research service in Beltsville, Md.,
began working on a sperm separation method. His goal was to do sex
selection for farm animals.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson labeled the DNA in sperm cells with a temporary,
nontoxic, fluorescent chemical. Once that chemical was in the sperm
cells, they would glow blue under a laser light. The more light
that was emitted when the laser shined on a sperm cell, the more
DNA the cell contained. That gave Johnson a way to detect small
differences in DNA content. He modified a cell sorting machine so
that it would detect it.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial interests soon stepped in. In 1996, the Colorado
State Research Foundation and Cytomation Inc. of Fort Collins
formed a company, XY Inc., and appointed Dr. George Seidel, a
professor of physiology at Colorado State University as scientific
director. They plan to use the sperm selection method for breeding
animals, starting with cows and horses.
</P>
<P>
   It is easier to sort cow and horse sperm than human sperm,
Seidel said, because the DNA difference between X and Y sperm is
more marked. In cows, X-bearing sperm have 3.8 percent more DNA
than Y-bearing sperm and in horses, X-bearing sperm have 4.1
percent more DNA, whereas the difference in human sperm is just 2.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that it works,'' Seidel said. Molecular
biological studies indicate that more than 90 percent of the X and
Y bearing animal sperm are sorted correctly, he said. ``We just
checked the pregnancies on 30 animals and just one was the wrong
sex,'' Seidel said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the Genetics &AMP; IVF Institute began their program
five years ago, licensing the method and modifying the machine to
sort human sperm. The first couple they assisted wanted a daughter
because the woman carried a gene for a rare disease, X-linked
hydrocephalus, that strikes boys almost exclusively. Two of her
brothers had died of the disease and so had two of her sons. Using
sperm sorting, she and her husband had a healthy girl who is now
almost 3, said Dr. Susan Black, a geneticist and infertility
specialist at the institute.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the encouraging results so far with human sperm
sorting, the reactions of some fertility experts indicated that the
Genetics &AMP; IVF Institute might be stepping into an ethical
minefield.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to sex selection, DeCherney said, ``most people
feel this is tampering with nature,'' and find it abhorrent.
</P>
<P>
   And unexpected ethical issues can arise, said Rawlins, the in
vitro fertilization laboratory director at Rush Medical College. In
the early 1990s, Rawlins and his colleagues offered couples a
method of sex selection, which did not turn out to efficiently sort
sperm. Rawlins said he and his colleagues saw sex-selection as a
way to help couples who had genes that could cause sex-linked
diseases to have normal children. In addition, Rawlins said, he and
his colleagues thought it would be acceptable to offer sex
selection to couples who had already had two or three children of
one sex and who wanted a baby of the other sex.
</P>
<P>
   But, Rawlins said, he learned that some couples in whom the
method failed were aborting their fetuses. He ended his program.
</P>
<P>
   None of the Genetics &AMP; IVF patients who wanted girls have
aborted fetuses of the undesired sex although one couple who wanted
a boy aborted a female fetus, Dr. Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Barry Zirkin, who heads the division of reproductive biology
at Johns Hopkins University's School of Hygiene and Public Health
in Baltimore, Md., said he remains to be convinced about the safety
of the method, which involves staining sperm's DNA and piercing the
sperm with a laser.
</P>
<P>
   Fugger said that when the institute began offering the treatment
to people ``there had been more than 300 animals born. Now there
are more than 400 animals in five different species and there are
no adverse effects in any of them.'' And, he added, ``we currently
have normal healthy babies. Our experience is the same as the
experience in animals.''
</P>
<P>
   But Zirkin said several hundred animals is not enough to pick up
a rare or subtle defect. It is one thing, he said, to use
experimental methods for infertile couples who could not have
babies any other way. But, he said, ``to me, sex selection is
another category.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not curing a disease and it's not curing a societal
problem,'' Zirkin said. ``There is no reason for haste and every
reason to be cautious.''

EDITORIAL: THE GLOOM AROUND BILL CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Sept. 9:
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton returned to work this week in a Washington
unmistakably transformed since his hedged, much-ridiculed
confession to the nation last month about his relationship with
Monica Lewinsky. With Democrats increasingly allergic to their
leader and Republicans no longer treating impeachment proceedings
as unthinkable, Clinton faces a rapid erosion of support that
imperils his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   As an astute politician and adroit card player, Clinton must by
now realize that his incomplete explanations about Ms. Lewinsky are
a losing hand.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton wants to regain some control over his political
situation, he must change course decisively and quickly. The
country demands a serious presidential discussion about the
Lewinsky case and its moral, legal and political implications. If
Clinton chooses not to lead that conversation himself, it will be
shaped by Kenneth Starr and may ultimately take the form of
impeachment hearings in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's fellow Democrats did the country a valuable service
last week by initiating a thoughtful debate about the president's
behavior. Sen. Joseph Lieberman, a longtime Clinton ally, made
clear in an anguished, unsparing speech on the Senate floor that
Clinton's cryptic comments would not suffice. Sens. Bob Kerrey,
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Barbara Boxer and Ernest Hollings later
voiced their own misgivings.
</P>
<P>
   With so many Democratic candidates avoiding him, it is clear
that the party will not rally to the president's defense unless he
abandons his legalistic dodging.
</P>
<P>
   Much now depends on Starr's report to Congress, which is being
drafted with appropriate speed. Evidence of obstruction of justice,
witness tampering or perjury might well propel the House toward the
first stage of impeachment proceedings. Starr correctly rejected a
request by Clinton's lawyer, David Kendall, for an advance copy of
the report. The document is being prepared for a panel of three
federal judges and the House. The White House will get its chance
to reply in due time.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his lieutenants want to believe that the president's
job performance ratings make him impervious to criticism in
Washington. But the ground shifted under Clinton during his
vacation. He is no longer viewed as the victim of a zealous
prosecutor but rather as a disappointing man who lied repeatedly to
the country and his family. The velocity of events show how badly
he miscalculated in offering an abbreviated statement to the
country on Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton last week belatedly edged toward greater openness by
endorsing Lieberman's speech and calling his own conduct
``indefensible.'' The same can be said of his continued refusal to
talk to the nation. Another adjective that comes to mind is
self-destructive.

EDWARD ROBB ELLIS, 87, DIARIST OF 22 MILLION WORDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Ill., Mo., La., Okla.)   (bl)  
 By JANNY SCOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Edward Robb Ellis, who in 1927 began keeping a diary
to fend off the boredom of his small town Midwestern adolescence
and emerged nearly 70 years later as the most prolific known
diarist in the history of American letters, died Sept. 7 at St.
Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 87 and
lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   A newspaperman and author of several books of narrative history
who once spent the better part of a decade trying to compile
single-handedly an encyclopedia of New York City, Ellis published
approximately 1 percent of his 70-volume diary in 1995 in a single
volume entitled ``A Diary of the Century: Tales From America's
Greatest Diarist'' (Kodansha America).
</P>
<P>
   The unedited diaries, estimated at 22 million words or roughly
half the size of the Encyclopaedia Britannica and filling 50
cartons that if laid end to end would extend 75 feet, became part
of the manuscript collection of the Fales Library at New York
University last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie was a force of nature,'' said Marvin Taylor, the
director of the Fales Library, the rare book library at NYU. ``He
was incredibly intelligent, quick, funny and always on the make. He
had an abiding interest in everyone's story, and clearly also in
his own.''
</P>
<P>
   Born and brought up in Kewanee, Ill. (``Hog Capital of the
World,'' he wrote in his first diary entry), he embarked upon his
diary writing at age 16 when, bored during a Christmas break and
shooting hoops with a few friends, he idly suggested they see who
could keep a diary longest.
</P>
<P>
   In simple, direct language, the diary tracks Ellis' trajectory
through the University of Missouri and a succession of newspaper
and wire service jobs in New Orleans, Oklahoma City, Peoria and
Chicago and finally to New York City, where he worked for The New
York World-Telegram from 1947 to 1962.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today I arrived by train in New York City, which I had never
seen before, walked through the grandeur of Grand Central Terminal,
stepped outside, got my first look at the city and instantly fell
in love with it,'' he wrote on May 22, 1947. ``Silently, inside
myself, I yelled: `I should have been born here!'''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis went on to become in many ways a classic New York City
character. In 1966, he published a history of the city from Peter
Stuyvesant to John V. Lindsay, entitled ``The Epic of New York
City,'' that writer Pete Hamill has called ``the best one-volume
history of the metropolis ever published.''
</P>
<P>
   When Yale University Press and the New-York Historical Society
came out with their Encyclopedia of New York City in 1995, Kenneth
T. Jackson, the Columbia University historian and editor of the
book, credited Ellis in the introduction with being the first to
recognize the need for such a work.
</P>
<P>
   In later life, Ellis lived alone in an increasingly rundown
apartment in a 19th-century town house in Chelsea amid mounting
towers of manila folders, five sets of encyclopedias and a
collection of books whose extent he estimated at various times at
10,000 to 15,000 volumes.
</P>
<P>
   A gregarious eccentric who talked about one day publishing a
book of maxims called ``Infinity and Three Doors Beyond,'' Ellis
took notes each day, then typed them up into diary entries the next
day.
</P>
<P>
   The diaries, which were for a time listed in the Guinness Book
of World Records under the category of ``Largest Diary,'' combine
the worldly and the mundane _ encounters with the likes of Herbert
Hoover, Arturo Toscanini, John Dewey, Louis Armstrong and Mae West;
details about things like the cost of a cup of coffee; an
excruciating account of the early death of his beloved second wife,
Ruth Kraus Ellis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is one of those diaries that will be useful to
people for a long time,'' Hamill said Tuesday. ``You can always get
the memoirs of some general or half-baked politician. But to try to
get the diaries of ordinary people is the hardest thing for a
certain kind of historian.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis, who also wrote a history of the Depression, ``A Nation in
Torment,'' and a history of the home front during World War I,
``Echoes of Distant Thunder,'' is survived by a daughter from his
first marriage, Sandra Gail Ellis of Creswell, Ore.; two
half-sisters, Doris Wedge Kent of Peoria, Ill., and Joanne Ellis
Alley of Suring, Wis., and two granddaughters.

SOSA SHOWS RESPECT; MCGUIRE RETURNS IT

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Sammy Sosa actually wanted to weep after Mark
McGwire made baseball history by lining his 62nd homer to eclipse
Roger Maris' illustrious 37-year old record on Tuesday night. Sosa
watched a delirious McGwire stumble around the bases during a
historic trot and thought that, indeed, he would cry while
witnessing the warm scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I couldn't,'' Sosa explained, ``because I'm a tough guy.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a typical Sosa quip, but Sosa was being candid. If it was
an emotional night for McGwire, so too for Sosa, who chased Maris
day by day with his new best friend from the Cardinals and acted
more like his biggest fan than his biggest competitor. Sosa brought
out the personality and power in McGwire, and major league baseball
and fans, new and old, were the beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   With a red home run king cap that McGwire had sent to him
sitting in his locker, Sosa spoke about McGwire the way a younger
brother might talk about an older brother: with reverence, with
respect and with awe. McGwire is the new home run king, but Sosa,
who has 58 homers and could still pass Maris or even McGwire, is a
very worthy prince.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember that we play against each other, we're not enemies,''
said Sosa. ``We are talking about two people, two human beings who
do their jobs. We also have a good relationship, as a friend and as
a nice person. We're in this thing together.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the end. There was an amazing scene involving McGwire and
Sosa after the homer off Steve Trachsel, a scene for history and a
scene that crossed barriers and spoke of brotherhood. McGwire
embraced Sosa and lifted the 200-pound man up as if he were a bag
of groceries when Sosa finally hustled in from right field to
congratulate McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't to be part of the celebration,'' said Sosa. ``It was
to congratulate Mark because he's my friend.'' McGwire and Sosa
touched fists up high and stopped just short of punching each other
in the stomach, which has become McGwire's trademark following
homers during a memorable season. Before Sosa returned to the
outfield, McGwire paid tribute to him by performing the Cub's
routine following homers. In unison with Sosa, McGwire touched his
lips twice, kissed them and then pointed to the skies. Then they
hugged again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `You're the man. You did it,''' said Sosa. ``That was
something emotional. That was something unbelievable. That was a
great feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Definitely for McGwire and maybe for Sosa, but not for Trachsel.
The 27-year old right-hander was planning not to throw McGwire any
strikes on Tuesday night, but he uncorked a shin-high fastball that
McGwire launched into history. Trachsel's name went with the ball,
forever the answer to a trivia question and forever his era's Tracy
Stallard. Still, Trachsel did not think he would be remembered as
the pitcher who served up No. 62.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to hit 10 more before the season is over,'' said
Trachsel. ``I think the guy who gives up the last one is the one
who will be remembered.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs are tied with the New York Mets for the wild card berth
in the National League so McGwire's momentous homer obviously hurt
their post-season chances in a contest they eventually lost, 6-3.
But third baseman Gary Gaetti and catcher Scott Servais hugged the
new home run king during his trot and two other infielders also
congratulated him. It was rather delicate, especially since Servais
sheepishly admitted that he merely wanted to shake hands with
McGwire and wound up with one hug in a hugathon of a night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough thing,'' said Servais. ``I think the thing you
have to do is look at the bigger picture. Everyone on the field has
been a fan since they were 5 or 6 years old and they've followed
every game and know the history of baseball. When something like
that happens and he does what he did, it's a great
accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaetti, who co-owns a race car with McGwire called ``Mac
Attack'' said, ``When you see something like that happen, you just
react. It was unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire looked tired during Tuesday night's game, closing his
eyes several times while he sat in the dugout and as he waited in
the on-deck circle. But the eyes that looked tired to observers
told a different story to Sosa. Sosa claimed that saw a man who was
ready to break one of the hallowed records in baseball history in
front of 49,987 fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked two or three times, especially today, and he said
he felt great,'' said Sosa. ``He thought he was going to do it
today and I could see that confidence in his eyes. That's why he's
the man.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, everyone laughed. Sosa is a charming sort, an ambassador
for baseball and a man who showed precisely how to act in a
difficult situation. Sosa was constantly placed behind McGwire, but
he developed a bond with McGwire and said that is where he should
be. After Tuesday night, Sosa was right. Right behind McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have to say that nobody in the ball park ever had the
feeling that they had today,'' said Sosa. ``It was amazing.
Everybody knew what they were waiting for. When he connected with
the ball, everybody was like, `Wow.' My reaction was, `Yes, he did
it.''' &QL;

their post-season chances in a contest they eventually lost, 6-3.
But third baseman Gary Gaetti and catcher Scott Servais hugged the
new home run king during his trot and two other infielders also
congratulated him. It was rather delicate, especially since Servais
sheepishly admitted that he merely wanted to shake hands with
McGwire and wound up with one hug in a hugathon of a night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough thing,'' said Servais. ``I think the thing you
have to do is look at the bigger picture. Everyone on the field has
been a fan since they were 5 or 6 years old and they've followed
every game and know the history of baseball. When something like
that happens and he does what he did, it's a great
accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaetti, who co-owns a race car with McGwire called ``Mac
Attack'' said, ``When you see something like that happen, you just
react. It was unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire looked tired during Tuesday night's game, closing his
eyes several times while he sat in the dugout and as he waited in
the on-deck circle. But the eyes that looked tired to observers
told a different story to Sosa. Sosa claimed that saw a man who was
ready to break one of the hallowed records in baseball history in
front of 49,987 fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked two or three times, especially today, and he said
he felt great,'' said Sosa. ``He thought he was going to do it
today and I could see that confidence in his eyes. That's why he's
the man.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, everyone laughed. Sosa is a charming sort, an ambassador
for baseball and a man who showed precisely how to act in a
difficult situation. Sosa was constantly placed behind McGwire, but
he developed a bond with McGwire and said that is where he should
be. After Tuesday night, Sosa was right. Right behind McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have to say that nobody in the ball park ever had the
feeling that they had today,'' said Sosa. ``It was amazing.
Everybody knew what they were waiting for. When he connected with
the ball, everybody was like, `Wow.' My reaction was, `Yes, he did
it.''' &QL;

EDITORIAL: CONFRONTING TRENT LOTT, AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Sept. 9:
</P>
<P>
   Majority Leader Trent Lott gloated when campaign finance reform
failed in the Senate last winter, despite the support of most
senators. But in a climate of public anxiety about ethics, the
cause of cleaning up the election system was bound to return.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, emboldened by the House passing the Shays-Meehan ``soft
money'' ban in August, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., reintroduced
campaign reform in the Senate. Now Lott is again in the grotesque
position of supporting a filibuster to thwart the majority's will.
Again, the cause of reform depends on Republicans showing more
sensitivity to voters than to Lott's campaign money addiction.
</P>
<P>
   What Lott hopes to see this week is a replay of last February,
when there were only 52 votes out of the 60 necessary to cut off
his filibuster against the McCain-Feingold bill. More Republicans
will sign up if they feel enough popular pressure. To help clarify
their thinking, an independent group called Public Campaign has
commissioned surveys in several states with Republican senators
retiring or running for re-election. They show overwhelming
sentiment for reform in New York, Missouri, Colorado, Ohio and
Indiana. Alfonse D'Amato, Christopher Bond, Ben Nighthorse
Campbell, Mike DeWine and Dan Coats, please note.
</P>
<P>
   The poll even shows that 58 percent of residents in Mississippi
favor passage of the McCain-Feingold bill, putting Lott in the
position of opposing a majority in his own state as well as in the
Senate. The bill, also sponsored by Russell Feingold of Wisconsin,
would ban unregulated soft money from unions, corporations and
individuals that has poured into the political parties for national
campaigns, circumventing the ban on such money for the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The soft-money scam has also belatedly caught the attention of
Attorney General Janet Reno, who Tuesday accelerated her
investigation into whether an independent counsel should
investigate President Clinton's role in using soft money for the
Democrats' issue ads in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Lott hopes that in the absence of broader support among
Republicans, he can pull the McCain-Feingold bill from the calendar
and declare the issue finished. He will no doubt lecture proponents
against disrupting the Senate's business, even though it is Lott
whose filibuster is disrupting the calendar. Only by pressing for
vote after vote will McCain expand support for reform.
</P>
<P>
   Lott likes to dismiss the issue as peripheral to voter concerns.
But voters remain highly critical of the way politicians cater to
special-interest money. Majorities in both the Senate and House are
on record as favoring change. It is time for Lott to recognize that
reform is the one step Congress can take right now to restore the
public's faith in the integrity of their political system.

RANGERS RALLY PAST ROYALS, 7-6
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ His knees hurt.
</P>
<P>
   His range appears to be diminishing as the season grows older,
and his batting average suffers as a result. Nevertheless, Rangers
manager Johnny Oates refuses to replace second baseman Mark
McLemore in his lineup as has been suggested recently.
</P>
<P>
   McLemore rewarded Oates' faith in last night's improbable yet
stirring 7-6 victory against the Kansas City Royals last night at
The Ballpark in Arlington. The Rangers overcame a two-run deficit
in the ninth inning and emerged victorious after catcher Ivan
Rodriguez delivered a game-winning, two-run single with one out
against closer Jeff Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   The victory moved the Rangers to within two games of the
American League West-leading Angels.
</P>
<P>
   The sore-kneed McLemore, who entered his ninth-inning at-bat
with one hit in 10 previous at-bats against Montgomery, served as
the catalyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking about pinch hitting for Mac,'' Oates said
afterward, ``and I said, `I can't do this. He's one of our key
guys.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery promptly put McLemore at a disadvantage by throwing
his first two pitches for strikes, yet McLemore fought the
right-hander and eventually drew a walk after seven pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mac and I have been together for too long,'' Oates said, ``and
I've seen him do too many good things to stop playing him.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates then summoned Luis Alicea as a pinch hitter for center
fielder Roberto Kelly, and the reserve infielder delivered a
single. That brought left fielder Rusty Greer to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Greer greeted Montgomery with a run-scoring double down the
third-base line on a 1-2 fastball. Royals manager Tony Muser chose
to intentionally walk right fielder Juan Gonzalez with first base
open, and Montgomery responded with a strikeout of first baseman
Will Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, though, dumped Montgomery's next pitch into shallow
right field for the game-winning single that scored Alicea and
Greer. The hit prevented the Rangers from suffering their fourth
loss in 10 games to sub.-500 teams after leading by three or more
runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's in the past,'' Greer said. ``We've got to worry about
the here and now.''
</P>
<P>
   How Rangers right-hander John Burkett departed before the Royals
scored remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve of 24 batters reached safely during Burkett's presence.
The Royals collected nine hits, including three doubles, and drew
three walks. Nevertheless, the Royals stranded seven runners,
including six in scoring position, during the first three innings.
</P>
<P>
   Right fielder Jeff Conine stranded five of those runners _ four
in scoring position _ with his first-inning fly ball and
third-inning strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett retired designated hitter Jeremy Giambi to begin the
fifth inning before surrendering consecutive singles to second
baseman Jose Offerman and third baseman Dean Palmer. Conine drew a
two-out walk to load the bases, and that brought Oates from the
dugout and left-hander Greg Cadaret from the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like for him to be able to pitch six or seven shutout
innings, but it wasn't going to happen tonight,'' Oates said. ``I
felt that John had battled, battled and battled for 42/3 innings,
but everyone is on a short leash now.''
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Hal Morris never saw a strike from Cadaret during
his plate appearance, and that forced Offerman across the plate
with the visitors' first run. Oates responded by summoning
right-hander Tim Crabtree from the bullpen for right-handed-hitting
catcher Mike Sweeney, who promptly delivered a three-run double
that gave the Royals a 4-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers would overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Oates returned to his office after the game. The telephone in
his office indicated that a message awaited for him. Oates' wife,
Gloria, called before the manager's return from the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been talking about perseverance,'' Oates said. ``She
added a couple of words to it, and it's something we all can use
for inspiration: Perseverance builds character, and character
brings hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we can cling to. We've got hope.''

AN OVERWHELMING MOMENT: NO. 62
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Mark McGwire's magical mystery tour to the pinnacle
of baseball's most captivating mountain came to the wildest
feel-good conclusion in sports history last night at Busch Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   If the Cardinals' huge first baseman hasn't given you a hug yet,
just wait; he'll get around to it.
</P>
<P>
   No. 62 is in the books.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, McGwire, who had tied Roger Maris' single-season
record with his 61st home run Monday afternoon, became baseball's
long-ball king with his shortest round-tripper of the season.
Facing Cubs starter Steve Trachsel with two out in the fourth
inning, McGwire unloaded on the first pitch he saw, sending a
341-foot bullet just over the left-field fence and only a few feet
inside the foul pole.
</P>
<P>
   History made way for McGwire at 8:18 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   A typical McGwire home run takes off like the space shuttle,
rocketing majestically to the far reaches of major-league stadiums
and most national parks. A neon sign high above the batter's eye in
center field at Busch Stadium, 545-feet from home plate, wears a
gigantic Band-Aid to signify McGwire's most titanic shot of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   But none has ever been louder than the one he hit last night.
This was the shot heard 'round the world.
</P>
<P>
   This was No. 62.
</P>
<P>
   There is no more exalted number in sports.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, not sure his searing line drive would get high enough
to clear the fence or whether it would hook foul, gave us the best
big-homer dance down the first-base line since Carlton Fisk's
hip-hop pleading in the 1975 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   This shot, though, was even bigger and better than that one, a
laser beam on which we could have hung a month's worth of laundry.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we hung our hearts on it.
</P>
<P>
   That McGwire would get 62 and go beyond became inevitable during
the past few weeks. He hits one every seven at-bats, or
thereabouts. If he hadn't connected last night, he would almost
certainly have broken the record during the Cardinals' five-game
road trip to Cincinnati and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   That would have been a shame because St. Louis, as good a
baseball town as there is in America, deserved this, had earned the
right to see its hero go soaring past the record.
</P>
<P>
   ``After (Monday), doing what I did for my father (hitting No. 61
on his 61st birthday) and my son showing up just in time, I
thought, what a perfect way to wrap up the homestand by hitting the
62nd for the fans of St. Louis,'' McGwire said.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, McGwire wanted desperately to share the moment
with the fans here. Heck, he wanted to share it with everyone, from
his son Matt, to his teammates, to manager Tony La Russa and his
staff, to the Cubs and outfielder Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, who trotted in from right field to join McGwire and the
Cardinals during the 11-minute celebration in front of the St.
Louis dugout, seemed almost as elated as McGwire, despite falling
four dingers behind in the race to see who will ultimately claim
the single-season home-run crown.
</P>
<P>
   The moment was one of sheer boundless joy.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's because a huge portion of America was watching it
through a blur of tears. Tears from the heart.
</P>
<P>
   The best kind.
</P>
<P>
   How could you not feel your heart soften at the sight of
McGwire, so excited he almost forgot to touch first base, tapping
his chest and pointing to the heavens above, a message of love and
gratitude to The Man Upstairs and to Maris, who came before him?
</P>
<P>
   How could the chill bumps not run up and down your spine as
McGwire mouthed the words ``Thank you, St. Louis'' after he touched
home plate?
</P>
<P>
   How could your eyes not fill up when, for the second time in as
many days, he lifted 10-year-old Matt in his arms and kissed him?
Or when he bear-hugged La Russa? Or when he climbed into the stands
to embrace the Maris children and lean his forehead against theirs
as he whispered words meant only for them?
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has, in fact, gathered us all up into his huge arms,
carrying us along for the ride of our lives. He never kept us at a
distance, but held us close to his heart and for that we can be
eternally grateful.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's eyes filled with tears, too, when he revealed that
before yesterday's game, a Hall of Fame official brought him the
bat that Maris had used to hit No. 61 with in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   ``I touched it,'' McGwire said, ``and I touched it with my
heart. Now I can say that my bat will lay next to his and I'm
damned proud of it.''
</P>
<P>
   He is a man, like so many others, who has struggled at times
with personal relationships, a man who admits he is only now
learning how to communicate his feelings, a man who loves children
and who most of all wants to be the greatest father in the world.
</P>
<P>
   A man worthy of the greatest record in sports.
</P>
<P>
   He inherits it from a man who never seemed to be comfortable
with it anyway. Perhaps now, finally, Roger Maris can sleep in
peace.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of us, the biggest feel-good party of our era
continues.
</P>
<P>
   Where McGwire will yet take us on this most fantastic of
journeys, no one knows.

NANCY TOPF, 55, CHOREOGRAPHER AND TEACHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nancy Topf, a choreographer, dancer and teacher, died
on Sept. 2 in the crash of Swissair Flight 111 off Nova Scotia. She
was 55 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Topf performed with many choreographers in the postmodernist
and more traditional new modern-dance scene in New York City during
the 1960s, among them Art Bauman, Elizabeth Keen, Katherine Litz
and Deborah Hay. She began a career as an independent choreographer
and performer in 1969, becoming known for minimalist dance that was
highly physical with an implicit emotional quality and that often
incorporated geometric patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing Ms. Topf's ``Garden Gate'' in 1991 in The New York
Times, Jack Anderson wrote of unhurried, rooted movement that
embodied architectural characteristics of the performance space.
``Reaching and swinging motions'' of the arms, Anderson wrote,
suggested the dancers had ``grown wings, an illusion that invested
`The Garden Gate' with the strange exhilaration of a dream of
flying.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, Ms. Topf appeared in the first formal showing of
contact improvisation, an influential form of fluid physical
improvisation based in the gaining and losing of balance. She
developed a technique of neuromuscular retraining, which involved a
repatterning and realignment of the body that many dancers found
helpful for healing chronic injuries and focusing on their creative
work. Ms. Topf had a private practice in New York and was also an
internationally known teacher. When she died she was flying to
Geneva to teach.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of the University of Wisconsin, Ms. Topf received her
primary training from Merce Cunningham and Barbara Clark, but also
studied with Robert Joffrey, Anna Halprin, Steve Paxton and the
H.B. Studio. She also wrote about contact improvisation and
reviewed dance for publications including Dance Magazine, The New
York Times and The Village Voice.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Topf is survived by her husband, Jon Gibson, a composer with
whom she often collaborated, and a son, Jeremy, both of Manhattan;
her mother, Celia Topf Straus of Lauderhill, Fla., and three
sisters, Bobbi Straus of Port Washington, N.Y., Peggy Schwartz of
Amherst, Mass., and Margie Topf of Boston.

GLENN BERNBAUM, 76, NEW YORK RESTAURATEUR 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ENID NEMY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Glenn Bernbaum, the owner of Mortimer's restaurant, a
favorite watering hole for Manhattan socialites, glitz folk and
achievers since 1976, died late Monday night or early Tuesday
morning at his home in Manhattan. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was unknown, his lawyer, A. Richard Golub,
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bernbaum built Mortimer's on the sheer force of his personality.
An unassuming, brick-walled, moderate-size restaurant at Lexington
Avenue and 75th Street, it became virtually a private club to the
sort of fashionables whose names fill the gossip columns. Through
the years, Bernbaum spent hours each day juggling seating
arrangements because his restaurant had only 19 tables, most of
which barely accommodated four diners each.
</P>
<P>
   Royalty, nobility and status names like Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis, Brooke Astor, Gloria Vanderbilt, Bill Blass, Reinaldo and
Carolina Herrera, and Nan Kempner were automatically assigned
visibility _ 1B, the window table to the right of the door.
</P>
<P>
   On the rare times when these luminaries were not present,
Bernbaum had to make decisions that would stump Solomon. If there
was a party of four or five ``known'' people, the table went to
them. If there were more than one party of such rank, Bernbaum
would reach back to his maxim: ``The trick in seating is not where
they are but who they are surrounded by.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally, older well-knowns got tables along the wall and
younger ones got the tables down the middle. Diners of faint
accomplishment were exiled to tables near the kitchen, Bernbaum's
version of Elba. Men and women not familiar to the owner or the
maitre d'hotel were known to stand forlornly at the door for
embarrassing minutes and were often brusquely turned away. A food
critic dining anonymously at Mortimer's once described the welcome
accorded walk-ins as a greeting normally given to bill collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Bernbaum's decisions naturally inspired strong feelings, as did
his favorite stance, hands clasped behind his back. The
unrecognized thought him rude, affected and elitist. The
``regulars'' considered him one of their own. Bernbaum, when he
deigned to defend himself, observed that all restaurateurs favored
friends and loyal customers.
</P>
<P>
   Mortimer's was generally acknowledged to be the clubby East Side
restaurant described by Tom Wolfe in ``Bonfire of the Vanities.''
But the scenes for the film adaptation were not photographed there,
because the movie people ``believed people in the Midwest wouldn't
understand the plainness of the place,'' Bernbaum once said.
</P>
<P>
   The undistinguished decor of Mortimer's was matched by the food,
which rated few critical accolades. But the menu items known as
comfort foods _ twinburgers, chicken hash, mashed potatoes, lemon
meringue pie and rice pudding _ were renowned among the
sophisticated clientele. Renowned, too, were the moderate prices,
no small attraction to the well-heeled. ``The rich don't like to
spend money,'' Bernbaum said. ``And they like to spend money here
less than anyplace else.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the rich used the restaurant for private parties _
birthdays, anniversaries, farewells and welcomes for social lion
guests _ and publishers used it for book parties. Bernbaum
orchestrated almost all of them, from the table settings and
flowers to the theme decorations. He also created what came to be
known as his ``society sandwiches'' for them, little triangles that
were consumed like peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Glenn Bernbaum was born on April 5, 1922, and grew up in
a house just off Rittenhouse Square in Philadelphia. His father was
in the retail business, his mother was a devotee of fashion, and
although he had lost contact with his family, it is believed he is
survived by a sister. He was raised by a nanny and later attended
the University of Pennsylvania. When World War II started, he left
Penn and entered the Army, serving in the psychological warfare
division. After the war, he returned to Penn and got his degree.
</P>
<P>
   His first jobs were in retailing in Philadelphia and New York.
In 1959, he began running the Custom Shops, a New York chain of
menswear stores owned by Mortimer Levitt. He remained there for 20
years as executive vice president, a position he retained for four
years after opening his restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was generally considered that the restaurant was
named after Levitt, Bernbaum maintained that the name came about
through a combination of circumstances _ in rapid succession, a
dinner at Morton's, a restaurant in London; a talk with his friend
Stanley Mortimer, a grandson of a founder of Standard Oil Co., and
a visit from Levitt.
</P>
<P>
   Bernbaum was considered unflappable, perhaps because little
could measure up to a flap he survived soon after establishing
Mortimer's. Police officers walked in one day and arrested the
maitre d'hotel Bernbaum had brought from Greece. The charge:
conspiracy to murder Bernbaum. In the drawl that no one could quite
define and in a milder than expected reaction, Bernbaum said he was
``surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed that several employees had been told that they were in
the Bernbaum will, and the maitre d'hotel thought he would hurry
things along. The man, who had been turned in by a fellow employee,
was convicted and spent several years in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Bernbaum also originated the annual Fete de Famille, a benefit
for the AIDS Care Center at New York Presbyterian Hospital. Started
in 1986, the fete, held outdoors on 75th Street, has raised almost
$7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Golub, the lawyer, said the restaurant would be closed
indefinitely and that no decision had been made as to whether it
will reopen.

   ST. LOUIS _ Mark McGwire's season-long quest for baseball's Holy
Grail, a journey that gripped an entire nation, came to a
magnificent conclusion at 8:18 last night.
</P>
<P>
   He is now baseball's single-season home-run king.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire claimed the title when he smashed his 62nd home run of
the season off Chicago Cubs pitcher Steve Trachsel, breaking the
record set by New York Yankees outfielder Roger Maris in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an absolutely incredible feeling,'' McGwire said after
the Cardinals' 6-3 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The moment many people have been anticipating since spring
training came in the fourth inning when the St. Louis first baseman
hit a first-pitch fastball at his knees just over the left-field
fence at Busch Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, unsure if the ball was hit high enough, jogged to first
base while intently watching the fence. When the ball disappeared,
he thrust his arms triumphantly into the air and set off the the
biggest celebration yet of one of his home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what, I was so shocked,'' McGwire said. ``I
didn't think that ball had enough elevation to get out. I thought
it was going to hit the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   While fireworks exploded above Busch Stadium and 49,987 fans
erupted in ecstasy, McGwire started his historic home run trot by
hugging first base coach Dave McKay and missing the base in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire got straightened out and touched every base while
receiving congratulations from all four Cubs infielders and catcher
Scott Servais. He was then met by a joyful mob of teammates as he
touched home plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a sweet, sweet run around the bases,'' McGwire said.
</P>
<P>
   It was also only the beginning of a tumultuous revelry that
delayed the game for 11 minutes, the longest midgame gala since Cal
Ripken Jr. broke Lou Gehrig's consecutive games record in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an awesome moment,'' said Cubs third baseman Gary
Gaetti, a former teammate who gave McGwire a hug as he approached
third base.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire shared the ultimate moment of his career with as many
people as possible, first and foremost his son, Matt, the Cardinals
batboy who received a massive bearhug from his father. McGwire also
waved to his parents John and Ginger McGwire, who were sitting in
the stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ginger and I are deliriously happy of Mark's
accomplishments,'' John McGwire said. ``It's phenomenal what he's
achieved this year.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire then hugged as many of his Cardinals teammates as
possible while Sammy Sosa, the Cubs right fielder who has hit 58
home runs, jogged in from right field.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's top two sluggers this season first embraced, then
exchanged personal greetings. They went through the high-fist and
stomach-punch routine the Cardinals do after a McGwire home run,
then the from-the-heart kiss sign Sosa directs toward his mother
after a home run.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire then went into the stands to hug each of Maris' six
children who were in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them I met with the Hall of Fame people today and they
pulled out the Roger Maris bat,'' McGwire said. ``I touched it and
I touched it with my heart. Now I can honestly say my bat is going
to lie next to his in the Hall of Fame and I'm damn proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally he got on the stadium public address and thanked the St.
Louis fans, whom he has continually referred to as the greatest in
baseball. McGwire hit the home run in the final game of the
Cardinals' five-day homestand. The team left for Cincinnati late
last night and he didn't want to hit the record-breaking home run
on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``After (hitting his 61st) for my father and my son being there,
I thought what a perfect way to end the week and the homestand by
hitting my 62nd for the city of St. Louis and all the fans,''
McGwire said. ``I had a couple of milestones this year. I hit my
400th (of his career) and 50th on the road and I truly wanted to
(hit No. 62) here.''
</P>
<P>
   The home run was measured at 341 feet, McGwire's shortest of the
season. It didn't go into the stands, an ironic twist considering
all the furor and controversy surrounding fans catching the
historic home run.
</P>
<P>
   Instead it fell between the wall and the start of the bleachers,
into the stadium area where the groundskeeping crew watches the
game. It was retrieved by Tim Forneris, a member of the crew, who
gave it to McGwire during the postgame ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have something that belongs to you,'' Forneris said.
</P>
<P>
   During those ceremonies, Commissioner Bud Selig presented
McGwire with the first Commissioner's Historic Achievement Award.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only appropriate that this be given to the player who
broke baseball's most important individual record,'' Selig said.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals owner Bill DeWitt announced that McGwire's uniform
would be retired after his career was over, then presented him with
a 1962 Chevrolet Corvette as a gift from the organization.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, playing in the Cardinals' 145th game, grounded out in
his first at-bat, then was walked both times in his final two plate
appearances. He still has 18 games left to add to the record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope there's a lot of champagne on that flight to
Cincinnati,'' McGwire said. ``I think everybody is going to be
drinking except for the pilots.''

PUBLIC LIVES: TOUTING THE FLAVOR OF THE BIG APPLE

  CLEARING THE DECKS FOR A SPECIAL GUEST  (nk)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just when you thought New York City was safe enough
and clean enough to darn well sell itself, its tourism officials
are springing another promotional video on an unsuspecting world.
</P>
<P>
   The 13{-minute film, to be shown to travel professionals,
tourism executives and potential customers worldwide, is actually
the first such video produced in more than a decade by the New York
Convention and Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last one was hosted by Brooke Shields and is very dated,
of course,'' said Fran Reiter, president of the bureau. ``These
days we absolutely cannot just let New York City sell itself,
because travel and tourism is such an increasingly competitive
business.''
</P>
<P>
   This time the voice-over is by the voice of Bell Atlantic, James
Earl Jones. Among those making cameo appearances are some usual and
unusual suspects: Robert De Niro, Katie Couric, Al Roker, the
fashion designer Nicole Miller, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Donald
Trump.
</P>
<P>
   The video's five-borough, non-Manhattan-centric theme is ``New
York City ... Come Visit the World,'' meaning that New York ``is
the one city you can visit in the world to experience virtually any
and every culture the world has to offer,'' Ms. Reiter said.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the film will have its debut next Friday at a
new restaurant called City Hall. It's in a restored 1863 cast-iron
building on Duane Street in TriBeCa, and the proprietor, Henry
Meer, who also owns the Cub Room in SoHo, has installed large
blowups of classic Gotham scenes by the photographer Berenice
Abbott.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Reiter insisted that the new video is more than just ``a
traditional tourism promotion film,'' thanks to its cast, style,
pacing and direction by the mayor's media adviser, Adam Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   To which a certain die-hard New Yorker might respond, ``Yada,
yada, yada.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearing the Decks For a Special Guest
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's good to be king of the world. For an hour
recently, Leonardo DiCaprio was king of the Metropolitan Museum of
Art. At 5:30 p.m. last Thursday, after the museum closed to the
public, the star of ``Titanic'' was given a private tour of the
19th-Century Galleries.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had tried to come to see our Impressionists as a member of
the general public,'' said Harold Holzer, vice president for
communications at the Met. ``But it was difficult for him, and the
other patrons as well, because he was recognized.''
</P>
<P>
   And so Dr. Rebecca Rabinow, a curator from the museum's
department of European paintings, gave an hourlong tour to DiCaprio
and a friend, the rapper Q TIP. Both were clad in baggy jeans,
T-shirts, sneakers and caps.
</P>
<P>
   The 23-year-old actor _ who will be seen next in the forthcoming
Woody Allen film ``Celebrity'' _ spent much of his time with the
van Goghs, and lingered at ``Wheat Field With Cypresses.'' Despite
the late hour, an unusually large number of museum curators,
administrators and staffers suddenly seemed to realize that they
needed to wander through the 19th-century rooms during DiCaprio's
tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had tremendous interest in art,'' said Ken Sunshine, a
spokesman for DiCaprio, ``and spends a lot of time in galleries in
Chelsea and SoHo.''
</P>
<P>
   Although DiCaprio isn't yet a collector, ``he will be,''
Sunshine said, adding: ``He is very knowledgeable about
20th-century art, but doesn't know as much about the 19th century.
So he was asking a lot of questions.''
</P>
<P>
   After the tour, the Met reopened a counter in the gift shop, and
DiCaprio bought a silk scarf based on an 18th-century pattern ``for
an unidentified lady friend,'' Holzer of the museum said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a Leonardo, you know,'' said Holzer of the Met's
paintings. ``This was our first.''

EDITORIAL: OUT OF STEP ON THE HARLEM MARCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Sept. 9:
</P>
<P>
   Despite the vicious rhetoric of Khallid Abdul Muhammad, the
so-called ``Million Youth March'' in Harlem last Saturday ended
without serious violence, and with widespread praise for the
restraint and courtesy of individual New York City police officers.
</P>
<P>
   But rightly or wrongly, the massive deployment of police and
military-looking equipment focused the community's anger on City
Hall rather than Muhammad. Harlem's officials said their
constituents felt the Police Department's tactics were aimed more
at intimidating the community than protecting it.
</P>
<P>
   Harlem's leaders have denounced Muhammad's anti-Semitic rhetoric
repeatedly, and most doubled those condemnations after his speech
calling for a violent response against police. But many also
claimed the rally would have fizzled out on its own accord if
officers had not insisted on turning off the sound at 4 p.m.,
starting a melee. Police Commissioner Howard Safir insists that the
rally was stopped only because officers were being attacked. A
grand jury investigation by District Attorney Robert Morgenthau
will now have to decide whether Muhammad's rhetoric qualified as
incitement to riot.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to second-guess how many police officers are needed
to guarantee safety at an event of unknown size organized by an
irresponsible demagogue. But there is no question the massive
police presence in Harlem heightened a sense of isolation that
black neighborhoods feel under this administration. Instead of
lashing out at moderate black politicians, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
needs to meet with them. As long as there is racial
misunderstanding, venomous opportunists like Muhammad will prosper.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ST. LOUIS _ We knew how this story would end, yet we sat there,
captivated, watching it all unfold before us with eyes so wide and
hearts pounding through our shirts.
</P>
<P>
   We watched, because sometimes, like on an unforgettable Tuesday
night in St. Louis and across the nation, it was all right to be a
sucker for it all.
</P>
<P>
   We knew the hero with the rippling biceps and aw-shucks smile
would do it. It was clear Mark McGwire would get the home-run
record long before he rocketed a fourth-inning pitch from the Cubs'
Steve Trachsel down the left-field line, over the fence and into
history.
</P>
<P>
   We knew his son, Matthew, the cute little guy with the giddy
eyes, would be there waiting for him as he crossed the plate. He
would hug the kid and lift him high in the air like a proud father
does. We knew he would kiss his fingertips and touch the sky.
</P>
<P>
   He would raise his arms high and wide, as if hugging the entire
world. And we knew we would hug back.
</P>
<P>
   He would point to his parents sitting in the stands and laugh a
burly red-headed laugh. His helmet would be knocked askew,
teammates would flood the field, streamers would float to the
ground, and fireworks would light the sky.
</P>
<P>
   He would step out into the middle of the green grass under a
cool sky, just like in the movies, and he would tip his cap. He
would wipe a tear from his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   We knew the sounds and colors of the night would deafen the
senses yet warm the heart. We could see it coming days ago, weeks
ago, but we sat there with lumps in our throats, perspiration in
our palms, and watched it all unfold because not only did we know
Mark McGwire would break the record, but we knew Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   He was a hero. A real one. And sometimes, it's still all right
to be a sucker for it all.
</P>
<P>
   That's what this sincerest of moments at Busch Stadium gave us.
In an era of sports that too often can be contrived, too often
filled with athletes who are detached from reality or simply
spoiled, where the games can be too corporate, or forced, McGwire
gave us none of that.
</P>
<P>
   He gave us No. 62. It traveled 341 feet, the shortest distance
any of his home runs has traveled this year. But it went further
and did more than anything we've seen in years.
</P>
<P>
   No one told us when to cheer, or which product to buy, or when
to stand or sit. No one cared about which players were overpaid,
which were up for free agency, which were jerks. There were no
``noise meters'' on the JumboTron. The only meter was in our
hearts.
</P>
<P>
   That was a hero out there, the first real one we've seen in a
long time.
</P>
<P>
   And it was a man whose greatest feat outside of having the will,
skill and conscience to break Roger Maris' remarkable record was
realizing that he was indeed a hero.
</P>
<P>
   In an era when professional athletes can be distant, as distant
as the days of Ruth, DiMaggio, Mantle and Maris, McGwire bridged
the gap. He didn't just do what heroes do; he acted like heroes
act.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't just take the record. He took the responsibility that
went with it, and that's why we watched. Every step of the way and
with every swing of the bat, he did it the right way and said it
the right way.
</P>
<P>
   He gave past legends their due, constantly tipping his cap to
Ruth and Maris, speaking of wanting to meet the two great home-run
hitters in the hereafter so he could shake their hands. Before
Tuesday's unforgettable moment, someone handed McGwire the bat that
Maris used to hit No. 61 in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire was noticeably touched. He took the bat, took a few
swings, and then rubbed it against his chest for good luck. That is
why we watched.
</P>
<P>
   We wanted this man to do it. He gave kids not just a home-run
number to dream about, a record to shoot for, but an outline of how
to act.
</P>
<P>
   And in the middle of it all, when the pressure should have been
its greatest, he loosened up the most. He realized this was a rare
chance to be something not just for himself or even baseball, but
for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   People watched this home-run chase and fell in love with it
because people have had enough of Lawrence Phillips, Allen Iverson,
Albert Belle and Mike Tyson. Of players' strikes and owners'
threats. Of the Bud Bowl, the Extreme Games and all things sour and
insincere in sport.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati Reds manager Jack McKeon last week called it
``healing America,'' and that's what it was.
</P>
<P>
   The man who caught McGwire's 60th home run on Saturday, the shot
that tied Babe Ruth, didn't ask for money in return for the ball.
He was healed. He asked for a chance to take batting practice,
simply wanting to be a kid again.
</P>
<P>
   The man who caught home run No. 61 on Monday, the one that tied
Maris, didn't ask for money, either. He was healed, too. He asked
for a couple of signed jerseys and balls. He just wanted to meet a
hero.
</P>
<P>
   And Tuesday night, when the so-called million-dollar ball landed
in the hands of Tim Forneris, a grounds-crew hand watching the
moment from beyond the left-field wall, he didn't want a million
dollars or even a raise.
</P>
<P>
   He simply returned the ball. Later, he shook McGwire's hand. And
that's what we all wanted to do, because we knew he was a hero, a
real one. That's why we watched.

DOMBROWSKI INTERVIEW SET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Florida general manager Dave Dombrowski will interview
today in Los Angeles with Fox executive Peter Chernin for the
Dodgers' vacant general manager's position amid speculation he will
stay with the Marlins if offered the club presidency by new
ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati GM Jim Bowden also will interview today, but the
focus is on Dombrowski, a favorite of Fox for his hand in the May
15 Mike Piazza trade between the Dodgers and Marlins. A decision on
the Dodgers' position could come by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   John Henry, a billionaire commodities broker from Boca Raton,
Fla., is seeking to purchase the Marlins from Wayne Huizenga, who
cut his asking price last week from $165 million to $150 million.
That sale also could come by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Henry has told Dombrowski the position of club president/general
manager is his if he stays. Under that scenario, Dombrowski, who is
making $700,000 in the last year of his contract, is likely to
remain in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   During his first interview with the Dodgers two weeks ago,
Dombrowski met with Fox executive Chase Carey. Chernin was not
available, but will speak to him today.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden is a favorite of interim GM Tom Lasorda, but appears to
have lost some ground due to a reputation as a free spender. Bowden
has fallen out of favor with Cincinnati chief executive John Allen
for driving up the Reds' payroll two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Today is the first day of Round II in the interview phase. Bob
Watson, former general manager of the New York Yankees, and Kevin
Malone, former GM with Montreal and now Pat Gillick's assistant in
Baltimore, will also interview.
</P>
<P>
   Doctor's report: Dodgers reliever Antonio Osuna underwent
arthroscopic surgery Tuesday to remove a bone fragment from his
right elbow. Surgeon Frank Jobe called the surgery a success and
said Osuna should be ready by spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Hiram Bocachica, acquired from Montreal in the big July 31 trade
for pitcher Carlos Perez and shortstop Mark Grudzielanek, also
underwent surgery to remove bone chips from his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Mark Guthrie, who remained in L.A. to have his sore
left elbow examined, had an MRI on Tuesday, which revealed no
structural damage. He will rejoin the team Thursday in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort to skip start: Darren Dreifort, originally scheduled to
pitch Friday in San Diego, will skip a start due to a tired arm.
Dreifort approached manager Glenn Hoffman four days ago complaining
of fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort was impressive during stretches of his first season in
the starting rotation. But he began to falter in August, going 1-3
with a 5.47 ERA. ``There is nothing wrong with his arm, he is just
tired,'' Hoffman said. ``It has been a long year and we're sure he
will be fine with a little time off.''

   LOS ANGELES _ The question caught Skip Hicks by surprise.
Standing outside the Washington Redskins' training facility last
month, Hicks was asked how UCLA will replace the 1,671 yards and 26
touchdowns he produced last year. He paused for a moment, then
smiled meekly and stared at the cement.
</P>

   ``I don't know if you can replace a Skip Hicks,'' said Bruins
coach Bob Toledo. ``He was pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks is the No.5 rusher in UCLA history (3,140 yards) and the
Pacific-10's career touchdown leader (56). He could run over an
opponent or run by him. He was a good receiver, a capable blocker
and he altered the way teams defended UCLA. What he was, UCLA no
longer has.
</P>
<P>
   When the Bruins open the 1998 season Saturday against Texas,
they will lack a star tailback for the first time in five years.
The running-game responsibility _ shouldered with style and
substance by Hicks and Karim Abdul-Jabbar in recent seasons _ now
falls on three players whose combined college yardage (703) would
have been a good month for Hicks or Abdul-Jabbar.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's streak of four consecutive 1,000-yard rushers is in
serious jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have a good one-two punch that's just as good or better
than Skip,'' said second-string tailback Keith Brown. ``A lot of
people don't know who we are because we didn't have a chance to
shine with Skip around. But we played behind an All-American. This
is our chance to shine.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, a junior from Phoenix, has 421 career yards and a high
game of 88, against Oregon last year. He's strong and shifty but
not particularly fast. Nagging injuries and a bout of food
poisoning last spring _ ``Durell (Price) bought some strange meat
at a Mexican market,'' he explained _ have slowed his progress.
</P>
<P>
   The starter, for now, is 5-foot-7 sophomore Jermaine Lewis, of
Antelope Valley. Lewis (282 career yards) prefers to hide behind
his hulking linemen until a hole appears. Lewis is strong for his
size, but alas, 180 pounds is 180 pounds, and he is more
susceptible to arm tackles than are bigger backs. Despite averaging
5 yards per carry last year, he is best known for the yard he did
not make: fourth down at Washington State's 1, two minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't think about the pressure,'' Lewis said. ``You have
to have a level head. Skip left big shoes to fill, and we all feel
we're capable of filling them.''
</P>
<P>
   The third tailback, freshman DeShaun Foster of Tustin, is the
most intriguing. Physically, he's a hybrid _ big but not huge, fast
but not blazing. He has sensational vision and balance, and his
credentials are impeccable: 3,398 yards and 54 touchdowns last
season, one of the greatest seasons in California prep history.
</P>
<P>
   Is Foster ready for top-25 competition? For that matter, is
Lewis? Is Brown? If not, the Bruins will try to replace a
1,200-yard (Hicks) with two or three 500-yard rushers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't look as good statistically, but the good thing is
you aren't beating one guy up,'' said offensive coordinator Al
Borges. ``The chances are we aren't going to have a (1,200-yard
runner), but that's OK. We'll be a full three-deep with confidence
when DeShaun gets (the offense) down.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA will tinker the running game to accommodate its existing
tailbacks. Hicks thrived on sweeps and pitches, which utilized his
speed to the corners. The current group lacks Hicks' speed but runs
well between the tackles. The offense has been tweaked to reflect
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always have a balanced offense,'' Brown said. ``We'll be
fine, if me and Jermaine prove we can run effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has no doubt. He waited nearly three years for this
opportunity _ since Abdul-Jabbar's departure to the NFL after the
'95 season propelled UCLA to the top of his wish list. All along,
through a frustrating redshirt season (1996) and the fourth-down
fiasco at Washington State, he made the starting job his priority.
</P>
<P>
   Now is the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know replacing Skip is a huge load _ that's already been
expressed to me,'' Lewis said. ``But I love it. That's every
football player's dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Or it's UCLA's nightmare.

FOX'S COVERAGE PLAYS IT STRAIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a very subtle yet very important element of Fox's
coverage Tuesday during Mark McGwire's record-breaking 62nd home
run.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as McGwire's line-shot down the left-field line in the
fourth inning cleared the fence, the live camera stayed with him
all the way around the bases. No cutting away to fan or family
reaction. No flashes of exploding scoreboards.
</P>
<P>
   In this day of media immediacy, how the moment is chronicled
seems almost as important as the moment itself, because that's how
it'll be remembered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in an age of cameras and tape machines and expensive
trucks, but if you look at footage and video of some of the
greatest moments, the best are the ones that follow the athlete,''
said Fox play-by-play man Joe Buck, who had the honor of making the
home-run call while director Bill Webb had the presence of mind to
keep things simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize this is Mark's moment. It's worth us not showing
off. We just tried to do him justice and follow every step. If
there was a lot of cutting done, you might not have seen things
like him missing first base. It was like in 1988 when Kirk Gibson
hit his World Series home run and rounded second and he was pumping
his arm. That's the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the home run call that Buck admits he cribbed on his
scoresheet to read off if he had to couldn't be used: ``There it
goes, here it is, a new single-season home-run champ ... Mark
McGwire with number 62 ... as he floats around the bases and into
the history books.''
</P>
<P>
   But when McGwire swatted the first Steve Trachsel pitch toward
the foul pole, Buck barely had time to get out: ``Down the
left-field line. ... Is it enough? Gone! There it is ... 62 ...
touch first base!''
</P>
<P>
   So much for a rehearsed ad-lib.
</P>
<P>
   ``That home run shot was the old script buster,'' Buck said by
phone moments after the Fox telecast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing was to hit a bullet and watch it to make sure
it was fair. That was the way his last three were. None of them
allowed the freedom to get in everything you wanted to say, but
that's fine. The best possible scenario unfolded.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost. While he drew the lucky assignment for Fox _ ESPN did
the St. Louis game Monday and will do the game tonight _ Joe's
father, Hall of Fame broadcaster Jack Buck, didn't get to make the
call on radio. The long-time Cardinals broadcaster had that inning
off, so radio partner Mike Shannon, who was Roger Maris' closest
friend when the two played for the Cardinals in 1967 and 68, called
the shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no disappointment at all,'' Joe Buck said about his
father missing another call-for-the-ages. ``It was a no-lose
situation in the radio booth. Sure, I would have like it (if his
father made it), but dad has had some of greatest calls in the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Including Monday, when he said as McGwire hit No.61: ``Look it
there, look it there ... pardon me while I stand up and applaud.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Buck, the Cardinals' regular TV play-by-play man, says that
separating himself as a national broadcaster from a fan wasn't
possible Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider myself like a fan, and I did it like a fan would,
and I'm not sure on a night like this that's not such bad way,''
Joe Buck said. ``I'm not going to forget that I'm a broadcaster,
but I love what happened in front of me tonight.''

AGASSI LOSES MATCH, BUT U.S. OPEN LOSES MORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ By the time Andre Agassi took the court Tuesday
afternoon, the lunacy that had so dramatically punctuated his
survival attempt at the U.S. Open the previous night had all but
evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   Skies were clear. (Meaning there were no murky green-tinted
thunderstorms banking down from the New York skyline.)
</P>
<P>
   Heads were clearer, too. (Meaning no more mind games, no more
intentionally bad service tosses, no more moonballs and no more
smart-aleck appeals to the chair umpire, since a berth in the men's
quarterfinals was now very close at hand.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It just got so competitive, we could have put on boxing
gloves, thrown darts, anything not to do with tennis,'' Agassi said
of his fourth-round match with Karol Kucera.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, about 12 hours after the match had been postponed by a
Noah's Ark sort of rainstorm, things had calmed down significantly.
And what a darn shame, because it might have cost Agassi, who wound
up losing to Kucera 6-3, 6-3, 6-7 (5), 1-6, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   This Open will have to go on now without the eighth-seeded
Agassi, whose comeback from last year's stock market-like plummet
to No. 141 in the world could have benefited from going at least
another round here, which looked promising.
</P>
<P>
   See, before the rain came and before his match was postponed
overnight, Agassi had stolen the momentum _ not to mention the
crowd, which is trying to stay warm and friendly to the men's side
of the draw, which lacks pizzazz, especially now without Agassi.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, Agassi had suffered a court change and rain delay
while losing the first two sets and falling behind 1-4 in the
third. That was before Agassi switched into a comeback mode
inspired by a righteous fit of pique.
</P>
<P>
   Unnerved by 18 bad service tosses that Kucera allowed to bounce
down onto the court, Agassi finally decided he had had enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I certainly wasn't enjoying the way it was going up to
that point ... to watch the guy say I'm sorry for the 18th time,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   So, Agassi first asked chair umpire Norm Chryst if there was
anything in the rule book that could stop Kucera from using what
amounted to a hesitation tactic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if it's intentional or not. The bottom line,
there's a direct impact on me,'' Agassi said.
</P>
<P>
   When the umpire said there was no rule to stop Kucera, Agassi
decided to retaliate. He began catching his own service toss,
mockingly apologizing to Kucera. Then, escalating the warfare,
Agassi floated moonballs like he was back at some junior circuit
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   It worked, as Agassi wound up winning the third set and taking a
3-0 lead in the fourth, which explains why it appeared that Agassi
was on the brink of a comeback victory before the monsoon struck,
when he was in a truly New York state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   For pure theater, Agassi serves as this era's best answer (on
the men's side of things) to John McEnroe, Jimmy Connors and Ilie
Nastase _ antagonistic showmen who thrived at the Open because it
is here that their terrific tennis was so devilishly matched by
their outlandish antics.
</P>
<P>
   It does not take a Bud Collins or a Mary Carillo or a Fred Perry
or any other sort of latter day tennis head to figure out that the
more lunatic the match _ the more nutty and the more chock full of
crowd-pleasing antics _ the better it's going to suit a guy like
Agassi.
</P>
<P>
   And there is no rooting at the U.S. Open like the rooting that
goes on for the brash ones, for the cocky ones _ the guys and gals
with the biggest attitudes and the most glitzy Nike and Cannon
camera ads.
</P>
<P>
   And that, of course, would be Andre Boy. He looked like he
wanted to fill the bill during this year's tourney, too. Only
Agassi could not give the partisan crowd what it begged for.
</P>
<P>
   Up 2-0 in the fifth set, Agassi had Kucera down 15-40 and was on
the verge of breaking him for the second time. But Agassi then
netted a backhand _ drawing moans from the packed Stadium crowd _
and the door was cracked for Kucera. His serve improved, and he
wound up whistling an ace past Agassi to hold serve in the third
game. Then Kucera broke Agassi to tie the set at 2-all, stealing
back the momentum and the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he relaxed a lot, started playing better and I rushed
a bit. It doesn't take much for one set to get away from you,''
said Agassi, who is trying not to let too much tennis get away from
him any more.
</P>
<P>
   After his marriage to Brooke Shields in April of 1996, Agassi
decided to let his personal life be top priority. And while he
enjoyed hanging out on the set of Shields' TV show, Agassi's game
and ranking suffered.
</P>
<P>
   He did not win a single tournament in '97, when Agassi decided
to make another run at becoming one of the world's best players
again. It is a task not yet complete, but at least it's back enough
to stir things up again.
</P>
<P>
   ``By my normal standards, it's certainly been a bad year, but
I've got to keep in context because of how long it's been since
I've even been competitive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All that was left for Agassi was to offer a handicap what will
now be Kucera's quarterfinal against Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to give the advantage to Pete. I think he'll win in
four sets,'' Agassi said.
</P>
<P>
   He was talking about the next round of an Open no one was yet
ready for Agassi to exit.

VERMONT VOTE TURNS FICTION INTO FACT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating throughout) (sw) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Living out a scenario almost exactly like the script of
the movie he starred in, Fred Tuttle, a 79-year-old retired dairy
farmer and late-blooming movie actor with a campaign budget of $16
or so, unexpectedly won the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate
in Vermont on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Which was at first a bit awkward, considering that Tuttle has
announced that though he is running, he has little desire to serve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither Fred nor I want to go to Washington,'' John O'Brien,
Tuttle's campaign manager and the film maker who made him famous,
said on Tuesday afternoon. ``And Fred's wife definitely doesn't
want to go to Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there is little danger that Tuttle will win in
November against the solidly entrenched four-term Democrat, Patrick
Leahy. At one point, Tuttle had even said that he did not plan to
run against Leahy, but he said on Tuesday night that he would stay
in the race.
</P>
<P>
   With 79 percent of precincts reporting, Tuttle had 21,349 votes,
or 55 percent, while Jack McMullen had 17,363 votes, or 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Tuttle's point in running had been to urge the state to thumb
its nose at McMullen, a millionaire from Massachusetts who took up
legal residency in Vermont just over a year ago. Though he has had
a second home in Vermont for years, McMullen looked to some
Vermonters like the ultimate carpet-bagging flatlander in
comparison to Tuttle, who has lived his whole life on the same farm
in Tunbridge.
</P>
<P>
   Also, O'Brien readily acknowledged, Tuttle ran to help gain
publicity for the 1996 shoestring movie in which he stars, ``Man
With a Plan,'' which is offered on the central PBS menu this fall.
The film features Tuttle as, well, pretty much himself, a retired
Vermont dairy farmer in overalls and thick glasses, but one who
decides to run for the House of Representatives with the idea that
he has spent his life in the barn, and now just wants ``to spend a
little time in the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Through some Vermont synergy, however, Tuttle's movie fame and
political popularity have exploded. To the point, Leahy commented,
that when Tuttle marched in a Labor Day parade on Monday along with
other candidates, he was greeted as riotously as if he were a rock
star.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've voted in every election in Vermont since I was old enough
to vote, and I've never seen anything like this,'' Leahy, 58, said
in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien had said that if Tuttle won the primary, they would run
a positive campaign this fall aimed mainly at getting out the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be a campaign like America has never seen,'' he said.
``It'll be idea-based, and we have this secret Fred plan'' _ secret
mainly because it is not quite worked out yet, he added.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire's Republican primary for governor, Jay Lucas, a
business consultant who is a champion of tax cuts, defeated State
Sen. Jim Rubens, whose campaign emphasized education issues. Lucas
is expected to face a steep uphill battle against the popular
Democratic incumbent, Jeanne Shaheen, who was unopposed.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, seeking his second term,
easily won the Republican primary and will run against George
Condodemetraky, the Democratic candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin defeated token opposition to be
nominated for a fourth term. Ed Garvey, a former leader of the pro
football players union, defeated State Sen. Gary George for the
Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, Gov. Jane Hull, a Republican, easlily defeated Jim
Howl, a former television weatherman who was fired after being
accused of sexual harassment, and Charles Brown, who was in his
first race. Hull was running for the first time since she replaced
Fife Symington, who resigned a year ago after his conviction for
bank fraud.

BIG MAC MAKES MILESTONE MAGICAL 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST LOUIS _ Where were you at 6:18 p.m. Arizona time? &QL; 
Mark McGwire stood in the batter's box, one foot pawing the dirt
like a rodeo bull, waving his big bat across the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Where were you when it happened?
</P>
<P>
   No. 25 filled his lungs with air. Steeling himself, he turned
his green eyes to the figure on the mound. Cubs pitcher Steve
Trachsel. The loneliest man in town?
</P>
<P>
   Where were you when McGwire swung at the first pitch and
delivered the fantasy of every person in the sold-out ballpark and
across the landscape of America?
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's new Man of Steel watched the line drive rocket toward
left field. He began to run. For a second, he wasn't sure. ``I
thought it would hit the wall.'' Then the ball _ No. 62 _
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The 34-year-old slugger who had just taken ownership of the most
prestigious record in sports had done it. Excited? ``I was
floating.'' McGwire was so thrilled he forgot the first rule taught
to him as a Little Leaguer _ touch every base.
</P>
<P>
   He missed first base. ``I'd never done that before,'' he said,
laughing at himself after the game.
</P>
<P>
   He came back and touched it.
</P>
<P>
   He touched first. Second. Third. Home.
</P>
<P>
   He touched everything and everyone. He touched Cardinals fans
who had filled Busch Stadium, so proud and eager to celebrate the
achievement by one of their own.
</P>
<P>
   He touched his teammates. His coaches. He picked up his real
legacy, hugging his 10-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   He and Sammy Sosa embraced.
</P>
<P>
   When the schedulemaker arranged this September series the moon
was in the seventh house and Jupiter aligned with Mars. Baseball
could not have chosen a better night for history to happen _ in St.
Louis with McGwire and Sosa on the field together.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire had 61 home runs; Sosa 58. They have gone at it all
summer. Their home run derby has resembled two pals at a county
fair, one then the other swinging a giant sledgehammer, trying to
send a lead weight up a ruled pole that says, ``How Strong Are
You?'' and ring the bell on top.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire got dinger No. 62 first. No other man has hit so many
home runs in one season. A gentleman, a class act, McGwire later
climbed into the box seats and wrapped his Popeye arms around the
Maris family _ sons and daughters of the man whose 37-year-old
record he chased after, and surpassed. Whatever he said to them as
they huddled in that very public/private moment brought smiles.
Nods of appreciation. Tears. Big Mac touched them, too.
</P>
<P>
   The game is in McGwire's debt. This man who could hit Jell-O 400
feet has done what Babe Ruth did in 1927. He has revived a sport
that had been damaged and lifted it to new heights. McGwire is a
bigger draw than Beanie Baby Night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole country has been involved in this since the All-Star
Game,'' McGwire said. ``If this has brought the country together,
so be it.'' He couldn't wipe the grin off his face.
</P>
<P>
   He has hit home runs all across the country this year,
everywhere he goes, some of them tape-measure shots. He belted
three here in one game against the Diamondbacks. Fans like home
runs, and teams like the Marlins assembled a staff to please them.
Recently, in Florida, McGwire reached down and golfed one ball over
the fence. At times he has amazed even himself.
</P>
<P>
   Where were you when it happened?
</P>
<P>
   The man who delivered the ball that will be delivered to
Cooperstown and placed behind glass in the Hall of Fame was trying
to throw a strike. Trying to win a game.
</P>
<P>
   He may not realize it now, but like Tracy Stallard, who gave up
home run No. 61 to Maris, one pitch could define his life forever.
Imagine the newspaper blurb in the year 2060:
</P>
<P>
   `` Steve Trachsel, the former pitcher for the Chicago Cubs who
was on the mound when St. Louis'' ``slugger Mark McGwire hit his
record-setting 62nd home run in 1998, died yesterday''.
</P>
<P>
   `` Trachsel, after his retirement, received the Nobel Prize for
curing cancer''.``''
</P>
<P>
   `` He was 91''. &QL;

DODGERS WIN IN 11TH

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Raul Mondesi watched Mark McGwire's first at-bat from
the Los Angeles Dodgers dugout Tuesday afternoon and thought about
a little home run history of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Stuck on 29 homers for nine games _ including the last three he
missed with a sore lower back _ Mondesi returned to hit a
game-tying three-run homer in the top of the eighth inning that
helped the Dodgers to a 6-5 victory in 11 innings over the Arizona
Diamonbacks in front of 40,262 at Bank One BallPark.
</P>
<P>
   The game was won on a sacrifice fly by Eric Karros that scored
Matt Luke and gave rookie left-hander Jeff Kubenka his first
major-league victory.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Mondesi who gave the Dodgers a chance.
</P>
<P>
   It was hardly McGwire-like. The St. Louis first baseman set a
major league record early in the day with his 62nd home run of the
season. But Mondesi was pleased hitting his 30th home run for the
second consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   ``And anyway, I still think (Chicago's) Sammy (Sosa) should be
the MVP,'' Mondesi said of his fellow Dominican countryman, who has
58 homers. ``I think what Mark did is great for him and baseball.
That's twice as many homers as me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi, who said Monday he no longer wanted to play center
field because of the strain it caused his back, came back in right
and showed the flair that won him two Gold Gloves.
</P>
<P>
   He ran down a potential game-winning extra base hit by Jay Bell
at the right-field wall in the bottom of the eighth. But it was the
home run off former Dodger Willie Banks that helped the Dodgers
avoid a second consecutive loss to the expansion Diamondbacks in
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi came in with just two hits in his last 18 at-bats with
no homers and two RBI. He walked and scored in the fourth, homered
and doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Dodgers had 15 hits, but had runners in scoring
position with less than two outs in the ninth and 10th and couldn't
score.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi doubled to open the 10th off Arizona closer Gregg Olson,
who recorded his 200th career save in Monday's 4-2 victory. He was
sacrificed to third by Mark Grudzielanek, but Charles Johnson
grounded to third with the infield in and Trenidad Hubbard flied to
right to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth, Dodgers second baseman Eric Young beat out a high
bouncer in front of home plate and went to second on a sacrifice by
Alex Cora. Young did not score on a single to center by Karros, but
the inning ended when Bobby Bonilla grounded into an inning-ending
double play.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi's homer helped Ismael Valdes avoid his first loss since
July 11.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes returned from disabled list last Tuesday after missing
five weeks with a strained left side muscle and pitched seven
scoreless innings against the Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   It was in his second start that he looked rusty.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona took a 2-0 lead in the second after Travis Lee opened
with a single to right. Young made a difficult running catch of a
pop along the railing in right for the first out.
</P>
<P>
   But Valdes walked former Dodgers prospect Karim Garcia to put
runners and first and second. It was bad enough that Garcia has
walked just 16 times in 295 at-bats. It became worse when Arizona's
backup catcher Kelly Stinnett tripled to right-center, scoring both
runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers chipped away at Arizona left-hander Brian Anderson,
scoring a run in the third on Hubbard's sixth homer of the season.
They tied the game in the fourth, when Charles Johnson's RBI single
after Bobby Bonilla opened the inning with a single.
</P>
<P>
   It remained that way until the sixth when third baseman Tony
Batista, who homered Monday night, opened with a double. Batista
played shortstop Monday, when Jay Bell was given the night off.
Bell returned Tuesday and gave the Diamondbacks a 4-2 lead with his
18th homer.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, who signed a five year $34 million contract the day of the
expansion draft, started slowly this season. But in the last 17
games he is batting .329.

ANGELS FALL TO TWINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ On a night when Mark McGwire proved records are meant
to be broken, the Anaheim Angels and Minnesota Twins showed that
streaks also have a way of ending.
</P>
<P>
   Angels starting pitcher Steve Sparks entered Tuesday night's
game having won six consecutive decisions. His opponent, Twins
starter Brad Radke, had lost five in a row and was 1-7 with a 6.85
ERA since the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   So what happens? Radke pitches like Pedro Martinez and leads the
Twins to a 5-0 victory over the Angels before 20,444 at Edison
Field.
</P>
<P>
   The loss, coupled with Texas' ninth-inning comeback win, reduced
the Angels' American League West lead to two games with 18 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks (9-3) didn't pitch poorly _ he gave up three runs and
seven hits in six innings _ but he didn't get nearly the run
support the offense normally gives him. In Sparks' past six wins,
the Angels averaged 8.2 runs per game. But against Radke (11-13),
it was a different story.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Radke's recent trouble, he's always pitched well against
the Angels. Including Tuesday's game, Radke is 3-0 with a 1.65 ERA
in four starts against the Angels this season. For his career,
Radke is 7-1 with a 1.57 ERA against Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he's pitching now, he can get well in a hurry against
us,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said before the game, and he was
right.
</P>
<P>
   Radke gave up six hits in seven scoreless innings, striking out
seven and walking one. No Angels baserunner reached third base the
entire game. Between Tim Salmon's leadoff single in the fourth and
Chris Pritchett's one-out single in the seventh, Radke retired 10
Angels hitters in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Radke also got help from his defense. Third baseman Brent Gates
and second baseman Todd Walker made diving catches of line drives
in the third and seventh innings, respectively. Both catches saved
a run because the Angels had a runner on second base each time. In
all, the Angels lined out to an infielder five times in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Radke is not alone in shutting down the Angels' offense on the
current homestand. In four games (three vs. Kansas City, one vs.
Minnesota), the Angels have scored a total of eight runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins took a 1-0 lead in the first inning after Otis Nixon
singled, stole second, went to third on a groundout and scored on a
two-out wild pitch by Sparks.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, David Ortiz scored from first on a double by Pat
Meares for a 2-0 Twins lead.
</P>
<P>
   Two solo home runs by Terry Steinbach (sixth inning off Sparks,
eighth inning off Allen Watson) and another by Paul Molitor
(seventh inning off Watson) increased the Twins' advantage to 5-0.

McGWIRE'S FEAT BRIGHTENS ONE CORNER OF WORLD 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton, briefed on the latest developments while on
the golf course, reportedly let out a loud cheer. Political pundit
Pat Buchanan addressed the breaking story on a recent Crossfire
show. Nightline shed light on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Kenneth Starr's report is due any day, Russia is
on the verge of economic collapse and Osama bin Laden is on the
loose. From the Beltway to the Sun Belt, everybody is talking
baseball, Roger Maris and Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   The buzz generated by McGwire's pursuit of a single-season
home-run record that was exactly two years older than the player
himself began when the St. Louis slugger hit four home runs in the
first four days of the season. It crested Tuesday when McGwire
belted his 62nd home run to break Maris' 37-year-old record.
</P>
<P>
   After grounding out in his first at-bat against the Chicago
Cubs, McGwire came to the plate in the bottom of the fourth inning
and drilled Steve Trachsel's first pitch _ a breaking ball that
stubbornly stayed straight _ over the left field fence at 6:18
p.m., setting off 10 minutes of mayhem. The home run ball was
estimated at 341 feet, his shortest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so shocked because I didn't think the ball had enough to
get out,'' said McGwire, a former USC standout. ``It's an
absolutely incredible feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the many ballplayers who showered McGwire, 34, with hugs
and handshakes during the celebratory stoppage of play was Cubs
right fielder Sammy Sosa, who himself has hit a Bunyonesque 58 home
runs to push McGwire in the same way that Micky Mantle did his New
York Yankees teammate, Maris, in their pursuit of Babe Ruth's 60.
</P>
<P>
   The standing-room-only crowd included members of the late Maris'
family. Flashbulbs popped like so many champagne corks and the
standing ovation the historic moment uncorked was so loud and long
and strong it surely left everyone who heard it light-headed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My stomach's been turning. My heart's been beating a million
miles a minute,'' McGwire said. ``What a feat.''
</P>
<P>
   Dizzying doesn't begin to describe the scene during the
Cardinals' just-completed five-game homestand, both inside Busch
Stadium and outside baseball's usual boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody, it seems, has been McG-wired to baseball this past
week. As the native Southern Californian swooped in on Maris' mark
of 61, pilots started delivering updates on his every at-bat from
33,000 feet, and rock-and-roll radio disc jockeys stopped the music
to broadcast each of his mighty swings.
</P>
<P>
   Televisions in health clubs were tuned to St. Louis games and,
when he came to the plate, the exercise machines grew so silent you
could hear a heart rate drop.
</P>
<P>
   Sports pundits charted his progress as meticulously as
meteorologists tracked Hurricanes Bonnie and Earl.
</P>
<P>
   The difference? Hurricanes are an annual occurrence. Baseball,
by contrast, had suffered a few years of ebbing interest before
finding itself in the eye of a late summer storm that wreaked
delirium instead of destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Honestly, did anybody notice the NFL season got under way over
the weekend? No wonder the NFL quickly turned the scintillating
96-yard overtime scoring run by San Francisco 49er running back
Garrison Hearst against the New York Jets into a commercial; that's
the only way anybody outside of 3Com Park is likely to see it as
the day's sports highlight shows were dominated by replays of a
McGwire shot at No. 61 that barely curled foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm responsible for the game of baseball getting back on
its feet, well then I'm damn proud of that,'' McGwire said. ``It's
put baseball back on the map as America's Pastime.''
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball, more popular than the NFL? At the start
of this year, the Thompson Twins eclipsing Oasis in CD sales would
have seemed a safer bet. At this time four years ago, baseball's
bats were silent as a result of a season-ending strike that
engendered ill will among its faithful following.
</P>
<P>
   The image of the baseball player as a money-grubbing mercenary
continued to burn in peoples' minds as recently as this spring. A
survey conducted by the Simmons Market Research Bureau _ and
published in Newsweek _ found that 65 percent of Americans
professed not to be fans of baseball, with minority groups and
young city singles showing the most disinterest.
</P>
<P>
   That was before a kaleidoscope of images cropped up to
wonderfully blur the picture, so much so that Sosa and McGwire
grace the current cover of Newsweek and 10 pages inside are devoted
to baseball's best and brightest season in years. Already, we've
seen a 21-year-old pitcher for the Cubs named Kerry Wood nearly
strike out his age, fanning 20; Yankees pitcher David Wells hurl a
perfect game; San Francisco slugger Barry Bonds become the first
player to hit 400 home runs and steal 400 bases and the Yankees
sail to one of the winningest seasons in history.
</P>
<P>
   And now, McGwire has done in 145 games what it took Maris 162 to
do and what entire generations couldn't even approach.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, McGwire's achievement won't raise the value of the
ruble. It won't eradicate North Korea's supply of ballistic
missiles or lure demoralized Democrats back to Clinton's side in
time for the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   What McGwire did on a sultry St. Louis night won't change the
world. But it sure has brightened one corner of it.

THOMAS TO REDSHIRT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC freshman quarterback Jason Thomas will undergo
surgery on his left ankle to remove scar tissue and will redshirt
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, a high school All-American, must still see a specialist
to determine whether a build-up of fluid around his foot has
contributed to the pain he has experienced since he arrived at USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best thing for me in the long run,'' Thomas said
about the operation. ``It's not a sprint. It's long term. I've got
to take care of my body.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' scar tissue is a lingering effect from the fractured
ankle he suffered last season at Dominguez High.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors feel surgery is the best thing to do,'' USC coach Paul
Hackett said. ``He will be back for spring practice. They think he
will eventually be back by the first of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' father, Charles, said his son has no plans to transfer
and has not discussed transferring since the subject came up last
month during training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said he did not expect Thomas to transfer. ``I don't see
why he would. This is a medical issue,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Thomas also said he doubted his son would play
basketball at USC this season. With Thomas out, Quincy Woods is
expected to become the No.3 quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Pearsall probably out: Strong safety Grant Pearsall said he
probably won't play this week as he slowly comes back from a
strained ligament in his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a little sore and has a little tendinitis,''
Pearsall said.
</P>
<P>
   Denmon misses practice: Center Eric Denmon missed practice
because he was unable to get a flight back from Texas, where he
spent the weekend visiting his ill grandfather. Denmon is expected
back today, but for insurance, offensive lineman David Pratchard of
Canyon High has been switched to the No.3 center position.
</P>
<P>
   Depth chart adjustment: With Malaefou MacKenzie lost for the
season, Chad Morton is expected to receive more carries, Hackett
said. Petros Papadakis is the No. 2 tailback, with Frank Strong No.
3 and Jabari Jackson No. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said the Trojans will also probably use more three-wide
receiver sets with the return of R. Jay Soward this week
</P>
<P>
   McCullough to redshirt?: Hackett said he is leaning toward
redshirting freshman tailback Sultan McCullough, who is currently
fifth on the depth chart.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a redshirt candidate, but we won't make a decision for a
couple weeks,'' Hackett said. ``Right now, Frank (Strong) is a
little bit ahead.''

RECORD CHASE ISN'T CURE-ALL FOR GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Anaheim Angels manager Terry Collins began
this historic Tuesday with a quiet cup of coffee near his Seal
Beach home. Around him, people were chattering about Mark McGwire,
Sammy Sosa and the cap McGwire wears in press conferences, the one
that advertises another Seal Beach restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Collins let it all soak in. Morning in America. People talkin'
baseball again.
</P>
<P>
   Or were they?
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't hear anybody talkin' about the Angels,'' Collins said
in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball, wake up and smell the coffee.
</P>
<P>
   OK, McGwire has hit No. 62, a will-it-or-won't-it line drive in
St. Louis, raising goose bumps as far away as Edison Field, and
it's a bright new era for the pastime. Everybody says so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball is back'' (Time magazine, July 27). ``Baseball's
back'' (Los Angeles Times, Sunday). ``Even baseball nonbelievers...
have climbed aboard'' (USA Today, Friday).
</P>
<P>
   And sure, it's tempting to say that just as Babe Ruth saved
baseball in the '20s, McGwire is saving it in the '90s. Ruth saved
it from the Black Sox, McGwire is saving it from the blue suits.
</P>
<P>
   But to believe that, you have to believe two things that are
just not true.
</P>
<P>
   You have to believe baseball was dying in the first place, that
because attendance dipped a fraction following the 1994-95 labor
dispute, the game was heading straight for extinction.
</P>
<P>
   And you have to believe that the numerous, all-too-real problems
that afflicted baseball before McGwire ever hit a home run this
year, somehow have been wiped away along with Roger Maris' record.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball wasn't dying.
</P>
<P>
   But it isn't as healthy as it should be either.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire has given the sport a vitamin, not a cure.
</P>
<P>
   I'm thinking about this while watching the Minnesota Twins, one
of those small-town teams that could never afford a McGwire of
their own, play the Angels, one of those bottom-line corporations
that would never spend enough to sign a McGwire of their own.
</P>
<P>
   I'm thinking about this while watching on TV as J.D. Drew, the
No. 1 draft choice whose one-year holdout represented the evil of
agents, makes his major-league debut for the Cardinals in the very
game where McGwire symbolized the good in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   I'm thinking about this while puzzling over the recent edition
of Baseball Weekly that proclaimed ``Wild-Card Mania.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that people who stopped watching baseball are
watching baseball again. The question is whether they like what
they see.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that company is coming. The bad news is that
you haven't dusted in four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have to say that in the short term, this is exactly
what our game has needed,'' the Twins' Paul Molitor said of McGwire
before the game against the Angels. ``For the first time since we
took the game away from the fans heading into September (1994),
we've been able to keep baseball on the front of the sports page
solely because of what's happening on the field rather than owner
litigation or (labor problems).''
</P>
<P>
   Now, can baseball build on this delicious moment?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an opportunity for the players, the commissioner's office
and Major League Properties to jointly come together and put aside
selfishness and agree to share the pie,'' said Molitor, who thinks
about these things because he's a players association activist.
</P>
<P>
   A disaffected fan goes back to the ballpark because of McGwire,
and if McGwire isn't playing in that game what does he see?
</P>
<P>
   He sees a five-month regular season that is increasingly
stripped of meaning by the fact that the poorest organizations
can't hope to compete and the way the wild-card races among
mediocre teams distract us from the accomplishments of the
outstanding ones.
</P>
<P>
   You might like the wild-card concept because it keeps fans like
the Dodgers' interested in August and September. I say a system
that encourages a .500 team like the Dodgers to even dream of a
World Series is bush-league.
</P>
<P>
   And the prodigal fan finds that World Series games are still on
TV too late at night for his sons and daughters.
</P>
<P>
   The fear here is the McGwire phenomenon will teach baseball's
leaders the wrong lesson, that personalities and ``SportsCenter''
moments are the keys to popularity. That might work in the NBA,
where Michael Jordan puts on a show even if he's shooting 5 for 20.
That doesn't work in baseball, where Ken Griffey Jr. is liable to
hit four grounders and never field a ball.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope baseball looks closely at one of the things that make
Big Mac so appealing, which is that on his way to the most
celebrated of individual achievements, he never forgot that it's a
team game, and that it's wins and losses that really matter.
</P>
<P>
   When McGwire is just a pleasant memory and the folks in the
coffee shop are talking about the Angels, then we'll know that
baseball's back.

 McGWIRE'S HEART AS BIG AS HIS ARMS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Sweltering in the oppressive Mississippi Valley
humidity, it is almost impossible to imagine chills.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, it is almost impossible to imagine the deeds of Mark
McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   Chills 1, climate 0.
</P>
<P>
   Just 145 games into the season came home run No. 62. More than
any player, faster than any player, and in terms of grace under
pressure, better than any player.
</P>
<P>
   As overwhelming affection and pride washed over Busch Stadium
Tuesday night, McGwire was honored with a ceremony at the back of
the infield after his momentous deed.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving an antique Corvette (a '62, of course) from the
Cardinals, which later became his celebratory chariot as he lapped
his field of adulation, McGwire came to the microphone and reached
inside himself again, where there must be a well as deep as his
biceps are large.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled a moment earlier in the day when officials from the
Baseball Hall of Fame showed him the bat used by Roger Maris to set
37 years ago the record McGwire shattered Tuesday night in the
fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I touched that bat, I knew that tonight was the night,''
he said. ``I touched it to my heart. I now can say I can rest my
bat alongside Maris in the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm damn proud of it.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was corny. There was no question about its sincerity.
Perhaps the most endearing aspect of what was a splendid evening of
American sports was the respect that McGwire gave to the history of
his game, which is linked like no other to the history of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   After his laser shot ripped into the darkest, lowest _ and soon
to be most celebrated _ corner of Busch Stadium, after his home run
trot brought the nation's sports fans to their feet, after he had
taken the celebratory poundings and hugs from teammates and Chicago
Cubs rivals, McGwire did an astonishing thing. (It wasn't nearly as
astonishing as if he had failed to touch first base, but that was
disaster avoided thanks to first base coach Dave McKay, the game's
most valuable person).
</P>
<P>
   McGwire clambered over the field fence into the front row of the
grandstands near the Cardinal dugout to embrace the family of Roger
Maris, the late Yankee great who was so burned by the spotlight in
which McGwire shone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a big guy to be jumping into the stands,'' said Roger
Maris Jr., one of four brothers and two sisters who have been
reluctant but respectful flamekeepers for the celebration here this
week. ``I didn't want him to be hurt. But I was hoping he would
(come into the stands) so I could embrace him for what he's done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was his day, his moment. For him to let us partake in his
day was very special, a moment we'll never forget. I remember him
saying my dad will always be in his heart.''
</P>
<P>
   History is revered in baseball like no other sport. Yet many of
its players and executives don't grasp the significance and
continuity that is the game's saving grace when so many forces
attempt to pull it apart.
</P>
<P>
   When McGwire put his arms around the Marises, he pulled together
a family, a history and a baseball nation in a way that has never
happened before.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier moment with the Maris bat ``was the first thing that
came to my mind when I ran over there,'' McGwire said. ``I told all
of them (about the bat). It was an unbelievable feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   The day had a feel of connection to multiple generations that
baseball so rarely makes anymore. It ended with introductions of
former Cardinal greats Lou Brock and Stan Musial before the McGwire
salute, and it began with a salute to youth.
</P>
<P>
   The man who caught home run No. 60 on Sunday, 22-year-old Deni
Allen _ a salesman for the NFL Rams, no less _ had his baseball
fantasy fulfilled when the Cardinals granted his wish for batting
practice.
</P>
<P>
   After a few early whiffs, he lofted several decent fly balls to
the outfield, including a one-hopper over the right-field wall that
would have been a ground-rule double. Not only did baseball make a
fan for life, the kid demanded nothing for his valuable souvenir
but BP, gestures and trinkets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was well worth it,'' he said afterwards, grinning a lot
and sweating and gasping a little. ``This was never going to be
about money.''
</P>
<P>
   When's the last time somebody around baseball said that, and
meant it?
</P>
<P>
   A little later, McGwire and his friendly home run rival,
Chicago's Sammy Sosa, made a pitch to kids and an inadvertent
statement about how unaccountably easy this day was for them.
</P>
<P>
   The rock-music network MTV had made a request of Major League
Baseball a few weeks ago to tape McGwire and Sosa together
introducing one of the acts, the Backstreet Boys, on its awards
show tomorrow night.
</P>
<P>
   The date was made for yesterday, before anyone knew of its
import. Either Sosa or McGwire could have, with justification,
blown off the engagement. Instead, as several dozen reporters from
around the world watched along the third-base line, the Front Page
Boys fluffed line after line in multiple takes before finally
stopping the giggling long enough for a clean take.
</P>
<P>
   Babe Ruth, himself something of a backstreet boy, might have
pulled it off. But Maris? Never. Ditto for a lot of today's stars.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, along with Sosa, are achievers of different times, when
the game was recognized as paramount over the individual. Even
though the irony was that Tuesday night was about the acme of
individual prowess, McGwire's numerous acknowledgments and his
week-long (hey, season-long) effort to make baseball inclusive
instead of exclusive was paying massive dividends in a rebirth of
America's formerly best-loved sport.
</P>
<P>
   The player with the most, who reached it the quickest and in the
best way, created a national celebration of his sport at its most
enlightened richness.

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Astros first baseman Jeff Bagwell had taken enough playful abuse
from his teammates, who have made the first baseman the butt of
jokes for too long.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sure, Bagwell has 218 home runs during his eight-year
major-league career, and he has 823 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   But something was missing. He knew it. Unfortunately, so did his
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   But not any longer.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell hit the first grand slam of his career and matched a
personal best with six RBIs as the Astros pounded the Cincinnati
Reds 13-7 on Tuesday night before a crowd of 16,574 at the
Astrodome. The Astros' fourth straight victory moved them into a
tie with Atlanta for the best record (92-53) in the National League
and reduced their magic number for clinching a second consecutive
Central Division title to six.
</P>
<P>
   But on this occasion, one number was on Bagwell's mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys make fun of me all the time,'' said Bagwell, who
hit his grand slam off Reds reliever Rick Krivda in the third
inning to give the Astros a 10-3 lead. ``I've been hearing about
it. Brad (Ausmus) gives me a hard time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can finally sit back and relax and not listen to all that
anymore. They know I was thinking about it. That's probably one of
the first times you've seen me with a smile coming down the
third-base line coming toward home plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to his third-inning at-bat, Bagwell's 217 home runs marked
the longest stretch without a grand slam among active major-league
players. Los Angeles' Eric Karros, who has 176 home runs without a
grand slam, now holds the distinction.
</P>
<P>
   If it's any consolation to Bagwell, he wasn't alone. The Astros,
with the most explosive offense in the NL, had scored 791 runs, hit
157 home runs and had a .290 batting average before Tuesday night _
and did not have a grand slam. They were the only team in the NL
without one.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Mets' Mike Piazza has four, and 39 other NL players
had more grand slams than the Astros, who hadn't cleared the bases
with one swing since Luis Gonzalez accomplished the feat July 20,
1997, at Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It almost seems impossible that he can hit so many home runs
and never have a grand slam,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker said of
Bagwell. ``I think Jeff will feel a little less pressure with the
bases loaded now, not that he's felt it before. He's had plenty of
hits with the bases loaded.''
</P>
<P>
   A day after escaping with a 1-0 victory over the Reds, the
Astros opened the floodgates early and often Tuesday. They scored a
pair of runs off Cincinnati righthander Jason Bere (1-1) in the
first inning and followed with consecutive four-run innings to
provide starting pitcher Sean Bergman (12-7) all the run support he
needed.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis' Mark McGwire was the first baseman receiving all the
attention on this night, but Bagwell did his best with a single,
double, home run and six RBIs, tying his career high set in 1994
against Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, when Bagwell took a curtain call after his
third-inning slam, television monitors at the Dome showed McGwire
doing the same thing. After the game, the Astros reflected on
McGwire's path to a record 62 homers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made the world a baseball fan, and he's made baseball
players that play the game fans,'' second baseman Craig Biggio
said. ``You can't have an asterisk by his name. He got the record
the quickest of anyone, so they can take that asterisk and do
whatever they want with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Bagwell: ``I think the biggest thing is from day one, Mark
McGwire was supposed to get this record. That was tremendous
pressure. He hit 15 in 21 days and overcame the pressure. To know
that everyone wanted him to hit home runs and then go out and do it
_ that's awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cincinnati pitchers did themselves no favors with nine
walks. Bere allowed six runs, six hits and four walks in 1 innings,
and Krivda matched those numbers in three innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The walks really hurt us,'' Reds manager Jack McKeon said.
``You can't put eight guys on base against those guys. You can't
expect to walk three or four guys and get out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   They didn't. The Astros, winners of 16 of their past 20 games,
quickly erased a 1-0 first-inning deficit with two runs in the
bottom of the inning and led 10-3 after the third. The Astros added
two runs in the fifth and a run in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Bell was 3-for-6 with three singles, and Carl Everett and
Ausmus each had two hits. Biggio, Ricky Gutierrez and Bagwell each
scored three runs for the Astros, who went 5-0 against the Reds at
the Astrodome this season (8-3 overall) for their first home-series
sweep of Cincinnati since 1966.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an easy win. We don't get too many of those,'' Dierker
said. ``We started off hitting and kept on hitting until it got to
the point there wasn't much chance for them to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Bergman allowed four runs and seven hits in seven innings for
his first victory in nearly three weeks. His only flaws were a
two-run homer by Sean Casey in the third and a solo shot by Roberto
Petagine in the sixth. The Reds added three runs in the ninth off
reliever Trever Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the game goes on, I expect to get into a groove and get my
rhythm and not worry (about getting runs),'' Bergman said. ``I was
kind of fighting it all night.''

M'S FUTURE ON DISPLAY, BUT SAME OLD RESULT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ For the Mariners, Tuesday night's meeting with the
Tampa Bay Devil Rays was almost guaranteed to be anticlimactic.
Earlier, they had gathered 'round the TVs to watch Mark McGwire
make history. Then, word went out that right fielder Jay Buhner
will have elbow surgery today and be sidelined six to eight months.
</P>
<P>
   Some of their future was on display, though, and for five
innings it was encouraging. Right-hander Mac Suzuki, making his
Kingdome debut, held Tampa Bay scoreless until a walk and five hits
ended his night in the sixth and sent the Devil Rays to a 10-0 win
before 20,679 fans.
</P>
<P>
   The 23-year-old Suzuki (0-1) has been strong in the early
innings in both of his starts for the Mariners. Last week in
Boston, he held the Red Sox scoreless for six innings before
leaving with a 3-1 lead in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw the ball really well for five innings, and he started
to get the ball up some,'' said manager Lou Piniella. ``It was
basically a duplication of the game in Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   That time, the bullpen lost the lead. This time, the M's never
led. Tampa Bay left-hander Wilson Alvarez was aggressive with his
fastball, allowing two hits and no runs in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Suzuki was making just his third major-league appearance, and no
Devil Rays had faced him. Wade Boggs, who is closing in on 3,000
hits and does not strike out often, fanned in his first two
at-bats. But he jumped on Suzuki's first pitch in the sixth,
bouncing it through the middle for a leadoff single.
</P>
<P>
   Fred McGriff followed two batters later with his 17th homer, a
three-run blast to right that gave the Devil Rays a 3-0 lead. A
triple and double later, Suzuki was gone and the M's trailed, 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't get tired,'' Suzuki said. ``I just made a mistake to
McGriff.''
</P>
<P>
   Years from now, of course, Suzuki and the Mariners are more
likely to remember what happened 50 minutes before first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The M's had finished batting practice and were watching as
McGwire had his moment. When the record-breaking homer left the
park, players jumped off their chairs _ sports-bar-like _ and
cheered.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr., the American League's home run leader, popped
in from the trainer's room, having missed the shot by seconds.
Griffey hasn't had much interest in the home run race, but he asked
others what kind of pitch McGwire hit, and marveled at the Cardinal
slugger's prowess.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hundred and twenty homers in two years,'' said Griffey, who
has 106 in that span.
</P>
<P>
   As home run feats go, it's worth noting Buhner had three
consecutive 40-homer seasons (1995-97) before McGwire did.
</P>
<P>
   NOTES: Bench space was scarce in the bullpen after the M's
recalled right-hander Steve Gajkowski and left-hander Andrew
Lorraine from Class AAA Tacoma.

 New slugging king is eminently worthy
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ?????  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Last Friday night, Mark McGwire began a homestand
needing two home runs to tie Roger Maris and three to beat him. He
desperately wanted to get them in front of his adoring home fans.
</P>
<P>
   He hit No. 60 Saturday off Cincinnati's Dennis Reyes. He hit No.
61 Monday afternoon off the Cubs' Mike Morgan. And Tuesday night he
completed his mission when he took the first pitch he saw from
Chicago righthander Steve Trachsel in the bottom of the fourth
inning and drove it on a line over an 8-foot fence for the historic
home run No. 62 that broke Maris's 37-year-old record and
established McGwire as the all-time major league single-season home
run leader, a rather stupendous achievement, considering that he
still has 18 games to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely incredible,'' he beamed. ``I mean, I'm almost
speechless. I've been talking about this since January. Then I get
to 61, and the next thing you know, I hit a ball that about
disappears on me. I totally believe in fate, and that's what
happened this week. I thank the Man Upstairs.''
</P>
<P>
   The typical Mark McGwire home run lands in some distant corner
of the ballpark, state, or hemisphere. This one willed itself just
inside the left-field foul pole, barely clearing the wall that runs
underneath the first row of seats. After all the discussion about
the baseball's worth to the fan fortunate enough to catch the 62d
homer, it turned out there was no bonanza available after all. A
Cardinals groundskeeper named Tim Forneris retrieved the ball and
handed it over to McGwire during a postgame ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have something that belongs to you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There could not have been a more atypical Mark McGwire home run.
The official distance estimate was 341 feet, which makes it the
shortest home run he has hit all season.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it matters.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire is entitled to a routine home run every now and then. He
has passed Maris by knocking out a homer every 7.3 times at bat
this season and by smacking 16 homers in his last 27 games. And let
the record show that according to one expert witness, the historic
home run came on a pitch that any normal batter never would have
been able to hit anywhere, let alone over the left-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a fast ball, outside,'' pointed out Chicago catcher
Scott Servais. ``The only other person who could have done what he
did with that pitch would be Sammy (Sosa). No one else has the
extension possible to take that pitch and pull it for a home run.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first at-bat, McGwire swung at a 3-0 pitch and grounded
to shortstop. When he came up in the fourth, Trachsel had retired
10 men in succession and had a 2-0 lead. McGwire always says that
what he's looking for is a good pitch to drive, and it's apparent
that the pitch was good enough.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, unlike the average player, is completely unaccustomed
to what we shall call ambiguous home runs. He was so unnerved by
this peculiar hit that he actually hopped over first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave McKay (the first base coach) said to me, `You missed one
big thing. Touch first base!''' McGwire recalled. ``I've never done
that before. I'll always remember that. It was a sweet, sweet trip
around the bases.''
</P>
<P>
   The home run touched off an 11-minute celebration that included
lots of high-fiving, lots of hugging (McGwire surprising Servais
with a giant bear hug as he crossed home plate), and an emotional
trip into the box seats for a visit with the Maris family, with
whom McGwire has drawn very close.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hall of Fame people brought the bat Roger used to hit 61
to me today,'' McGwire said, ``and I touched it to my heart. That
was the first thing I thought of when I went to see them. It was an
unbelievable feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals manager Tony La Russa has referred to McGwire's
achievement as ``one of the great clutch performances of all
time,'' and who could argue? McGwire hit 58 home runs last season,
and hardly had the last bat been put away when people began to
speculate that he might be able to hit 60-plus this year. It was a
frightening burden for anyone to carry, and for McGwire to exceed
every wild fantasy by hitting his 62d home run on Sept. 8 stamps
him as one of the elite athletes of all time, no matter what the
sport or culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last week and a half,'' he said, ``my stomach has been
turning and my heart has been racing a million miles an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   No one watching him would ever know it.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that McGwire has done more than just break
America's most hallowed sports record. ``Here is what I'm going to
remember,'' said Servais. ``I'll remember that since Sept. 1, 1998,
the game of baseball has changed, and it's all because of Mark
McGwire. No one is talking about football. People are seeing what a
great game baseball is, and kids are going to start playing it
again. I think things happen for a reason, and for whatever reason,
this is Mark McGwire's time.''
</P>
<P>
   This has been the feel-good story of our generation, and it's
not over. Now that he has 62, he might just go from relaxation to
serenity without passing Go or collecting $200 and start blasting
home runs all over the landscape. The big weight is gone. ``I don't
know how heavy that arch is, but the arch is off my back right
now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Did somebody say 70?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times in life to celebrate,'' said commissioner Bud
Selig, a baseball fan to the core, ``and this is a time to
celebrate.''

McGwire dons home run crown  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By Larry Whiteside  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Fair or foul? That was the only question. Mark
McGwire hit a rocket to left field this time. It was said to have
gone 341 feet, but in truth, it traveled into eternity.
</P>
<P>
   With one monster swing, McGwire became baseball's new Sultan of
Swat Tuesday night. The Cardinals slugger's 62d home run of the
season _ a shot that struck just above the 8-foot-high fence down
the line at Busch Stadium _ eclipsed the one-season mark of 61 set
by the Yankees' Roger Maris in 1961 and matched by McGwire Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit the ball and I knew it was a line drive,'' said McGwire
of the pitch by Cubs righthander Steve Trachsel. ``I thought it was
going to hit the wall. Next thing I know, it disappeared. It's an
absolutely incredible feeling. I can honestly say I did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Given his doubts about the ball's destination, McGwire ran hard
to first base for a few seconds. But when he looked up, he saw the
ball sail out of the park and began leaping in a celebration so
exuberant that he hopped right over first base before coach Dave
McKay brought him momentarily back to earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave McKay said to me, `You missed one big thing. Touch first
base!''' McGwire recalled. ``I've never done that before. I'll
always remember that. It was a sweet, sweet trip around the
bases.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while third base umpire Gary Darling emphatically ruled
that the ball had been fair, McGwire already was circling the bases
en route to the warmest reception any player could imagine, one
that caused an 11-minute delay in the 6-3 Cardinals victory over
the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   He shook hands with each Cubs infielder as he rounded the bases,
stopping to embrace third basemen Gary Gaetti _ his teammate in St.
Louis earlier this season. He bashed elbows with third base coach
Rene Lachemann. He surprised Cubs catcher Scott Servais by hugging
him as he reached the plate. Then he was mobbed by the entire St.
Louis team, which spilled out of its dugout. He had wanted to give
almost every one of them a hug. And he almost did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember much of that,'' said McGwire. ``I was truly
floating.''
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa of the Cubs, McGwire's chief rival with 58 homers,
waited until the commotion died down before coming in from right
field to give him a huge hug, already having accorded him his
special two-finger salute immediately after the blast.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire then addressed the crowd briefly and visited with the
Maris family, sitting in box seats along the first base line.
</P>
<P>
   ``To all my family, my son, the Cubs, Sammy Sosa ... it's
unbelievable,'' McGwire said. ``Thank you, St. Louis.''
</P>
<P>
   The home run was McGwire's shortest all year. But distance was
incidental; all anyone cared about was seeing the inevitable become
reality. It did, in the season's 144th game _ easily surpassing the
162 Maris needed in '61 or the 154 Babe Ruth required when he hit
60 in 1927. And McGwire, who has hit seven homers in his last seven
games, has 18 games to pad his total.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's tangible reward was instant. Tim Forneris, a member of
the grounds crew, retrieved the ball when it landed in left and
presented it to McGwire during a postgame ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely incredible,'' said McGwire of the hubbub.
``The whole country has been involved with this since after the
All-Star break. People say it's bringing the country together. So
be it. I'm happy to bring the country together.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire had been pumped about the possibility of setting the
record for weeks. Since Aug. 20, when he became the first man to
hit 50 homers in three straight seasons, he had been eager to test
his theory that anybody who reached that plateau with a month to
play had a chance to catch Maris. Before the game, he had held the
bat Maris used to hit his 61st and rubbed it against his chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger, I hope you're with me tonight,'' McGwire said.
</P>
<P>
   That was the case, to McGwire's exhilaration and relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm damn proud of what I've accomplished and what I've had to
go through and especially the support I've been getting here in St.
Louis,'' said McGwire. ``It's absolutely incredible and I thank St.
Louis for everything.''
</P>
<P>
   After a postgame press conference, McGwire went back on the
field for a prolonged ceremony hosted by longtime Cardinals radio
voice Jack Buck and including commissioner Bud Selig. He also took
a ride around the stadium in a red convertible.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the ceremony in the immediate aftermath of the homer,
witnessed by a crowd of 49,987, that left him overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has won a lot of friends for baseball. But he hasn't
forgotten those who have been with him through the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``To everybody in Boston,'' he said in the middle of his
postgame press conference. ``Jim Corsi (his former Oakland teammate
and current Red Sox reliever) does know me. Thanks for giving me
that hug over the phone today.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the overall experience, McGwire said, ``It's been
awesome. The last week and a half, my stomach has been turning. My
heart has been beating 100 beats a minute. To do it that fast, I
give thanks to the Man Upstairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dedicated this to the fans of St. Louis. After Monday, doing
what I did for my father and my son showing up just in time, what a
perfect way to end the week. I hit my 400th (career) and 50th (of
the season) on the road this year. I really wanted to do it here,
guys, and I did it.''

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Raul Mondesi watched Mark McGwire's first at-bat from
the Los Angeles Dodgers dugout Tuesday afternoon and thought about
a little home run history of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Stuck on 29 homers for nine games _ including the three he
missed with a sore lower back _ Mondesi returned to hit a
game-tying three-run homer in the top of the eighth inning that
helped the Dodgers to a 6-5 victory in 11 innings over the Arizona
Diamondbacks in front of 40,262 at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   The game was won on a sacrifice fly by Eric Karros that scored
Matt Luke and gave rookie left-hander Jeff Kubenka his first
major-league victory.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Mondesi who gave the Dodgers a chance.
</P>
<P>
   It was hardly McGwire-like. The St. Louis first baseman finished
Tuesday by setting a major-league record with his 62nd home run of
the year. But Mondesi was pleased with hitting a career-high 30th
for the second consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's incredible, what can you say,'' Mondesi said of McGwire.
``And I think he'll keep it going. Me, I'm just happy playing again
and doing what I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi, who said Monday he no longer wanted to play center
field because of the strain it caused his back, came back in right
and showed the flair that won him two Gold Gloves.
</P>
<P>
   He ran down a potential game-winning extra-base hit by Jay Bell
at the right-field wall in the bottom of the eighth. But it was the
home run off former Dodger Willie Banks that helped the Dodgers
avoid a second consecutive loss to the expansion Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi came in with just two hits in his last 18 at-bats, no
homers and two RBI. He walked and scored in the fourth, homered and
doubled.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I was doing most of the season, hitting home runs
getting extra-base hits,'' he said. ``But I could no longer do that
and play center. It was too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Dodgers had 15 hits but had runners in scoring
position with less than two outs in the ninth and 10th and couldn't
score.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi doubled to open the 10th off Arizona closer Gregg Olson,
who recorded his 200th career save in Monday's 4-2 victory. He was
sacrificed to third by Mark Grudzielanek, but Charles Johnson
grounded to third with the infield in and Trenidad Hubbard flied to
right to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth, Eric Young beat out a high bouncer in front of
home plate and went to second on a sacrifice by Alex Cora. Young
did not score on a single to center by Eric Karros, but the inning
ended when Bobby Bonilla grounded into an inning-ending double
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, that looked a lot like the past few months,''
manager Glenn Hoffman said. ``But Mondy brought us back, Kubenka
gave us two great innings and Jeff Shaw closed it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi's homer helped Ismael Valdes avoid his first loss since
July 11.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes returned from disabled list last Tuesday after missing
five weeks with a strained left side muscle and pitched seven
scoreless innings against the Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   It was in his second start that he looked rusty, seven hits and
four runs in six innings. His biggest mistake was a two-run homer
by shortstop Jay Bell in the sixth that gave Arizona a 4-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some rough spots, maybe one of two pitches that
hurt me,'' Valdes said. ``But I am very pleased. There has been no
problem with the layoff.''
</P>
<P>
   Kubenka, who missed 2{ months of the Triple-A season with a
broken foot, took over to start the ninth. He allowed one hit and
got the win after Karros' sacrifice fly off Alan Embree (4-2).
</P>
<P>
   The game also featured a single by Dodgers rookie catcher Angel
Pena in his first at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Kubenka, a little lefty with a good screwball, who
gave the Dodgers bullpen a big relief. Shaw, who has pitched
sparingly since blowing four saves in six days, looked strong
Tuesday and recorded his 41st save.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was supposed to be here earlier this season when I broke my
foot,'' Kubenka said. ``It was tough to see all my teammates get
called up when I was sitting there rehabbing. But tonight made it
all worth it. I have the ball and the scorecard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The paper will say, `McGwire set record, Kubenka gets first
win.' I wonder which story will go on top.'' &UR;

COUNTER INFLATION BY ADDING MORE TO RETIREMENT POOL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, September 06, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I are both 47 years old and we wish to retire at
age 65 with a monthly income stream of $4,600. Our projected
monthly income from Social Security will be $2,000. Our investments
consist of these IRAs: $24,516 in Vanguard Index 500, $8,259 in
Vanguard Balanced Index, $8,940 in Vanguard Equity Income fund,
$22,957 in MFS Emerging Growth, and $37,324 in MFS Investors Trust
funds. We also have a $10,000 taxable CD. Is our portfolio properly
diversified, and how much should we save monthly to achieve our
future goal?
</P>
<P>
   J.T., Nashua, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. At first blush, it appears that you wouldn't need to add
anything. If we project 10 percent average annual portfolio growth
-- and despite the horrors of the markers in the last week, that
still seems to me to be a reasonable long-term assumption -- your
pool would reach $622,727 over the course of the next 18 years.
That would be more than enough to be reinvested in fixed-income
holdings and produce the desired income.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, all of that is before considering inflation. Let's assume
that over the years the Social Security payments will be adjusted
to reflect the effects of inflation, so that means what you'll be
looking for is the equivalent of $2,600 monthly in today's buying
power, or the equivalent of $31,200 a year. If we project future
inflation at 3 percent, that would require a $53,115 annual income
stream; at 4 percent, the number jumps to $63,205.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, in addition to an income stream in retirement, you'll
want to have some additional funds invested to counter the effects
of inflation in the later years of retirement. So from my point of
view, to be comfortably on track toward a secure retirement, the
goal should be somewhere north of $1 million. To achieve a $1
million pool over the next 18 years would require monthly additions
of $659 to the pool.
</P>
<P>
   As for the portfolio, it seems solid enough. I can't find a fund
called MFS Investor's Trust; perhaps that's only a part of the
name? But if this is a fund which is largely dominated by large-cap
stocks, I think you would want just a bit more diversification,
since MFS Emerging Growth would then be the only holding outside
the large-cap arena. If it was my portfolio, I'd establish 10
percent positions in a health care sector fund, and in a small cap
fund.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am an older woman, aged 80, and I have been getting by with
CDs. But with interest rates going down and my rent going up, I
could use a little extra income. I have a fairly large CD coming
due and I would like to put a little of it -- maybe $10,000 -- to
generate a little more money for rent increases and living
expenses. I have a friend who has money in Salomon Brothers Fund. I
don't know exactly what it is, but she has got more than 16 percent
interest. It must be a managed fund, and it has to be bought
through a brokerage firm. I also enclose a flier I got in the mail
from Atlas Balanced fund. What do you think of that?
</P>
<P>
   J.W., La Mesa, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think I would give both of these suggestions a pass.
Salomon Brothers Fund is a closed-end fund, which means it's a fund
with shares traded on the New York Stock exchange rather than
through direct purchases and/or sales by the fund company. That
means that when people are leery of stocks -- which constitute
almost all of the assets of this fund -- the shares will tend to
bring less than their inherent value. Entering this week, they sold
at an 11.49 percent discount from net asset value. Moreover, that
16 percent wasn't exactly interest -- it represents the amount paid
out in a combination of dividend and capital gains distributions in
the past year. With stock funds, the lion's share of such
distributions represent capital gains, and these are factors you
can't count on -- some years, when the markets are sour, there may
be none at all.
</P>
<P>
   Atlas Balanced, a small and relatively new fund, divides its
assets among stocks and bonds, but again, it's the stocks that give
it the kick in strong markets, or which can give you a kick you in
the pants when the markets go bad. The statistics in the brochure
look nice, but they don't reflect a lot of current history:
According to Lipper Analytical Services, the two Atlas Balanced
funds produced year-to-date returns of 1.91 percent and 1.52
percent through Aug. 28. (There are two classes of funds, with
different sales charges, and accordingly with different results.)
Anyway, the bottom line is that these investments might do great
things for you, but they might also produce little income and even
losses. You can't pay the rent on that. The only kind of funds that
might be attractive to a person in your situation would be
something like a Ginnie Mae fund, which is one that invests in
government-backed mortgages. But the best you could except from
such a fund is an income stream of about 6.5 percent, which would
mean $650 a year income on a $10,000 investment. Entering this
week, the nation's best rates on one-year CDs are slightly higher
than 6 percent. The question I'd ask you is whether an extra $4.16
a month is sufficient to warrant the additional trouble, and
sufficient to offset the additional risk? For most people, I think,
the answer would be no.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am a single 35-year-old female. I purchased a home in 1990,
and suddenly became disabled in 1995. I now have an income of only
$1,300 per month. I have these IRAs: $18,000 in Vanguard Index
Value, $14,000 in Vanguard Health Care, $11,000 in Vanguard Index
500, $12,000 in Vanguard Wellington, and $6,300 in Vanguard
Wellesley. I also have taxable accounts of $3,000 each in Vanguard
Windsor II and Health Care, and a $7,000 money market account. What
do you suggest I now do, since I have such a low income. Are my
present investments wise. If not, where might I do better?
</P>
<P>
   J.B., La Mesa, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think the IRA portfolio has been well established, by and
large -- provided that you expect to allow the accounts to grow for
many years. As a disabled person, you can qualify for early
withdrawals without penalty (although you would still have to pay
the taxes on the withdrawals). If you think it's likely that you
will have to call on some of this money in the relatively near term
-- by which I mean a significant level of withdrawals in the course
of the next decade -- I think I would look to move to a more
conservative balance. This would begin with a reduction of the
Health Care position, which now constitutes 22.1 percent of the IRA
portfolio and a whisker more of your total savings. That's a high
level for a sector fund, and while these positions are likely to be
the strongest for you over the course of many years, they also
represent the riskiest part of the portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore unless you're confident that you're likely to leave
the IRA accounts alone for 10 to 15 years or even longer, I would
reduce the Health Care position in the IRA to about $6,300, or 10
percent of the total portfolio. If you think you're likely to be
making withdrawals in the near future, you might do well to move
the money that came out of Health Care into Vanguard GNMA; if you
think there's a possibility of some intermediate-term withdrawals
but you don't know when they're likely to come, I suggest you put
the money into Vanguard Wellington until the time comes when you
anticipate withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   As for the other accounts, my guess based upon your limited
income is that your crying need is a steady stream of cash. Both
for that reason, and because of the risk element in the two stock
funds, I suggest that both the Health Care and Windsor II positions
be sold, with the proceeds going into Vanguard GNMA. If you
achieved a 6.5 precedent yield there and 5 percent returns from
your money fund, the yields on these two investments would add a
little more than $60 a month to your income stream.

ALTERNATIVES TO DIVIDENDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Monday, September 7, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am a divorced 67-year-old woman who's concerned about
making a wrong move investing. I need to supplement my Social
Security income of $550 a month. I have $60,000 I would like to
invest, and a further $10,000 that I will keep liquid. I have been
doing some research on no-load direct investing in individual
stocks. I've checked on Exxon Corp., Procter &AMP; Gamble Co., Texaco,
Home Depot, and Boston Edison. My major concern is that I need the
dividends to live on, or I'll use up my bank account. My money is
now making only 4.33 percent in a special savings account. I know I
can do better. What do you suggest?
</P>
<P>
   R.G., Rochester Hills, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, you can certainly do better than 4.33 percent, but not
necessarily with a portfolio of the stocks you mention.
</P>
<P>
   Of the five issues you cite, the only one with a dividend stream
in excess of what you're now getting is Boston Edison, which is now
called BEC Energy. This stock has a current yield of 4.7 percent.
The others don't come close, with Texaco at 3.2 percent, Exxon at
2.4 percent, Procter &AMP; Gamble at 1.4 percent, and Home Depot at a
near-negligible 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   All are well-established companies, with good prospects for
raising dividend levels in the future. But they are also companies
in the large-cap sector of the stock market _ the big national
companies whose shares have been among the driving forces in the
big gains in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   So while there's the positive prospect of dividends rising,
there's also the unpleasant prospect of your principal value
falling should the market take a further tumble.
</P>
<P>
   If you go in this direction, take only a modest step, perhaps
putting $10,000 in BEC Energy. By no-load investing I assume you
propose to buy a few shares through a broker and then enroll in the
company's dividend reinvestment plan, which in the case of BEC will
allow you to add up to $5,000 per quarter to your position.
</P>
<P>
   As for the additional $50,000, I would look for an investment
with a higher yield and lower risk. At the very conservative end of
the spectrum, you could pore over the nation's highest CD rates
(discussed in the next question) or look for one of the
better-yielding mutual fund money market accounts, where you will
find yields of 5.25 percent to 5.30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Or if you wanted to take on a little risk in exchange for a
still higher yield, you could look to a no-load mutual fund such as
Vanguard GNMA, which is yielding 6.44 percent as this is written.
</P>
<P>
   But you should understand a lot about such funds and their
risks. GNMA, or ``Ginnie Mae,'' funds invest in portfolios of
government- guaranteed mortgages. While there's no credit risk in
these investments, they are quite volatile when interest rates
change _ and even when people think interest rates may change.
</P>
<P>
   When interest rates rise, the share value of these funds falls,
sometimes substantially. The reverse happens in a falling
interest-rate climate.
</P>
<P>
   In short, it's going to be a bumpy ride. But the good news is
that the interest checks keep rolling in steadily. If you have the
patience to stay with such a fund for many years _ I'm talking
about a decade or more here _ you'll see it pay off in the long
run.
</P>
<P>
   You should not put money in such an investment if you think you
might have to cash out at an inopportune time; invest only as much
as you're willing to leave there through thick or thin.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I would move that last $10,000 into a mutual fund money
market, since this would give you the same liquidity as the bank
savings and a higher yield.
</P>
<P>
   If you took my most aggressive suggestion _ $10,000 in BEC
Energy, $50,000 in Vanguard GNMA, and $10,000 in a money market
fund _ you could expect a total annual yield of $4,215. That's
$1,184 more than you're now getting. This would bump your returns
up from the current 4.33 percent to an average portfolio yield of
6.02 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Where do you find a CD at 6 percent plus, such as you have
mentioned in recent columns?
</P>
<P>
   M.A., Chelsea, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Entering this week, one-year CDs with interest rates from 6
percent to 6.05 percent were available at Atlanta Internet Bank in
Georgia; Cross County Bank in Delaware; and Providian Bank in Utah.
Five-year CDs at the same institutions ranged from 6.35 percent to
6.41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   These figures, along with a number of other categories, are
available in the Sunday business section of The New York Times, and
are drawn from information supplied by Bank Rate Monitor and
Veribanc Inc.
</P>
<P>
   If you're investing a substantial amount of money, tracking
these can be rewarding, since the national average for one-year CDs
was 4.95 percent; for five-year CDs it was 5.23 percent. The
figures are published in the Consumer Rates feature, and include
toll-free telephone numbers of the institutions with the top rates.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. No doubt some editorial shrinkage occurs in your columns that
affects my understanding. For example, take an attached column.
Since IRAs, 401(k)s, and 403(b)s, etc., started just before my
retiring, I have difficulty understanding how the conservative
gentleman in the article could amass nearly $1 million with the
limited contributions allowed. Could the GNMAs have possibly been
that good? Perhaps I missed something?
</P>
<P>
   A.G., Beaumont, Texas
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You're certainly right that it would be tough to amass a $1
million IRA over a couple of decades simply by making the $2,000
maximum annual contributions. But you are also allowed to roll
qualified retirement plans over into an IRA.
</P>
<P>
   For example, at retirement many people are given an option of
taking annuity payments or a lump sum. If they chose the latter,
they roll the proceeds over into an IRA to avoid immediate
taxation. Such sums, of course, can be very substantial, and thus
account for the seven-figure IRAs that sometimes crop up in the
column.
</P>
<P>
   As a curiosity, I calculated what return would be necessary to
generate a $1 million IRA beginning in 1981 when the deductible IRA
was approved by Congress. Counting on nothing but regular $166.66
monthly contributions, the answer came out to 32.31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Where can I get information about the Stein Roe Young
Investor's fund? I am planning for a grandchild's college.
</P>
<P>
   A.M., Spurger, Texas
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You can reach Stein Roe by calling 800-338-2550. It's an
excellent fund, and especially good as a gift to young investors
because of its excellent reports designed to be read and understood
by very young owners.
</P>
<P>
   It also makes most of its investments in companies that are
likely to interest younger investors _ Coca-Cola, Walt Disney, and
William Wrigley Jr. are among its top holdings, but so are FNMA and
Gillette.
</P>
<P>
   Because this is an all-stock fund, it is most appropriate if

 &HT;    Jimmy Carter, man of peace
 &HT;    By Tom Blackburn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE UNFINISHED PRESIDENCY, by Douglas Brinkley. Viking; 586
pages; $29.95.
</P>
<P>
   To many minds, Jimmy Carter is the best ex-president in history.
That may underestimate John Quincy Adams, who received his
posthumous due in ``Amistad,'' but folks who didn't much like him
as president but love him as an ex probably don't know the half of
Carter's late career.
</P>
<P>
   That gap is admirably filled by Douglas Brinkley, a historian at
the Eisenhower Center of the University of New Orleans. Still, most
readers will decide they'd rather admire Jimmy Carter than be him.
</P>
<P>
   He's known for work with Habitat for Humanity, which builds
housing for low-income families, which goes beyond photo
opportunities to honest sweat, as well as for quixotic peacemaking
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   But they may not know how much Carter's moral suasion had to do
with Daniel Ortega's accepting the results of the Nicaraguan
election that deposed him. And they may not know just how many
elections he has monitored (17) or that he's responsible for
distributing medications for preventing river blindness to more
than 11 million people as well as nearly eradicating several
diseases, and winning freedom for political prisoners, 50,000 of
them by rough count.
</P>
<P>
   He's also written a fat, dry memoir of his presidency and
breezy, interesting books on the Middle East, elections, religion
and fishing. Wife Rosalyn has written a book (on growing old) with
him and others on her own. There is life after Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In the name of peace, he buddied up to Yasser Arafat; the late
mad dictator of North Korea, Kim Il-sung; the clueless communist
Ortega; Haitian bully Raoul Cedras; and indicted war criminal
Radovan Karadzic of the Bosnian Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, he has been effective. We occupied Haiti without
bloodshed when he talked Cedras into going. A boat ride with Kim
Il-sung may have averted the second Korean war. But none of his
solutions have been permanent, and sometimes he just got in the
way, as in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   In his own book, Richard Holbrooke, who brokered the Dayton
peace accord, tells how Karadzic tried to cash in on his relations
with Carter. Holbrooke snapped back that Bill Clinton is president,
not Jimmy Carter. Serbian President Slobodan Milosovic (no sweet
guy himself) thanked Holbrooke privately. Karadzic, he said, tried
to play the Carter card with him, too.
</P>
<P>
   Officials constitutionally responsible for foreign policy have
tried different ways to keep Carter in the corral. George Bush's
secretary of state, Jim Baker, used frequent phone calls and
briefings. Clinton's first secretary, Warren Christopher, cut
Carter off completely even though he had been Carter's personal
attorney and Carter lobbied to get him the job.
</P>
<P>
   Their problem was not only that they never knew what Carter was
saying to thugs, but that he had a bad habit of announcing deals to
the CNN crew Ted Turner sends everywhere with him before telling
Washington what was in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Critics see that as grand-standing. Carter may see it as
ensuring that the deal is known before the boffins at the White
House and State Department spin it away.
</P>
<P>
   Brinkley records all of this at a steady pace without bogging
down in psychology. His historical approach puts a load of
interpretation onto the reader. This reader, anyway, felt sympathy
for presidents and secretaries of state on the sidelines of some of
Carter's excellent adventures, even when Carter had logic on his
side.
</P>
<P>
   Simply, the man is single-minded, impervious to advice and
needlessly offensive toward the good guys. When he sups with the
devil, he uses a short spoon and flicks soup at the angels.
</P>
<P>
   That is the opposite of politics. Lack of charm may make him
effective in his new field, but soft soap has its uses, especially
in reaching long-term results.
</P>
<P>
   He's smart enough to know that, so a reader begins to suspect he
can't help himself. He is lashed to his grindstone of duty.
</P>
<P>
   Brinkley had access without censorship, but the only Carter
humor in more than 400 pages is a quip with a purpose. Sudan's
dictator was resisting the Carter Center's plan to bring in a
program to eradicate guinea worm, a painful, prolonged condition in
which worms grow in sufferers' bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no guinea worm in Guinea,'' Carter said, ``and we
have decided to name the worm after the country that is the last to
finish eradicating the disease. We don't want to have to call it
Sudan Worm.'' The point was taken.
</P>
<P>
   Carter has had a busy and fruitful late career. But the nearest
he seems to come to joy is grim satisfaction in his duty as he sees
it despite any and all setbacks. It's a personality we've seen
before _ in Sisyphus.

 &HT;    Loud, vulgar sitcom `Costello' nothing for Fox to shout about
 &HT;    By Kevin Thompson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stand-up comic Sue Costello is a lot like her brash,
in-your-face sitcom. The south Boston native is loud, tacky and
outspoken.
</P>
<P>
   There's one major difference, though. She's funny and
surprisingly charming (in person, that is). Her show isn't.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Costello gets the award for the season's tackiest _ and
loudest _ sitcom. Every two minutes someone's either screaming
words we can't print here or shouting such trashy lines as, ``Don't
get a hair across your butt!''
</P>
<P>
   Costello's so vulgar, it makes Married ... with Children look
like Frasier. Believe it or not, the comedy _ and we use that term
loosely _ is based on Costello's real life growing up in a
blue-collar Irish neighborhood. She plays Sue Murphy, a spirited
bartender who's trying to better herself by using such word as
``ubiquitous'' and ``capacious.''
</P>
<P>
   Sue stuns family and friends by breaking off her relationship
with her high school sweetheart, who just got a cushy transit
authority job. No boyfriend ... yikes, that means one thing.
Shouting Sue must move back in with her shouting folks (The Wonder
Years' Dan Lauria and Beverly Hills, 90210's Jenny O'Hara).
</P>
<P>
   And that'll just lead to more shouting. And more words we don't
care to hear on TV sitcoms. Tip to Fox: This trashy show needs to
go out with the rest of the network garbage.

 &HT;    Congress c hops Everglade budget
 &HT;    Robert P. King and Larry Lipman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   After years of doling out hundreds of millions of dollars to
help the Everglades, a skeptical Congress is cutting back.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate budget proposals could chop more than half the
$224 million that the White House wants to spend next year on
Everglades restoration and other South Florida environmental
projects.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts could:
</P>
<P>
   Indefinitely stall one of the region's longest-running
restoration projects, the repair of the Everglades' headwaters in
the Kissimmee River.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminate $58 million that the Interior Department and South
Florida water managers could use to buy undeveloped land near the
Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   Hamper more than a dozen smaller projects, including efforts to
reduce pollution of Lake Okeechobee and the St. Lucie River.
</P>
<P>
   The winners would include beach-widening and channel-dredging
projects by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The House budget
proposal would give those projects a $49 million boost in Florida
alone, including $25 million for Miami Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   The corps also would get $3 million to remove dredged soil from
Peanut Island in the Lake Worth Lagoon. The work would give the
corps room to dump more soil there but wouldn't help restore the
island, project manager Tim Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts arose partly from a wider turf war between Clinton and
the GOP-led Congress, including fights about cigarette taxes and
the percent of the corps' budget devoted to environmental projects,
lobbyists say. Some environmental groups also say Congress is
retaliating against Florida lawmakers, who passed two bills this
year that threatened to raise the costs of restoring the
Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reasons, alarmed environmentalists say the cuts
bode ill for the future. They've been hoping Congress will supply
half the estimated $7.5 billion it will cost to overhaul the
Everglades in coming decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you've been cut, it's very hard to go back and argue a
year later for full funding,'' said Joe Garcia, spokesman for the
Orlando-based Everglades Trust.
</P>
<P>
   The reductions also go against last year's five-year budget deal
between the White House and Congress, which included substantial
increases for the Everglades, said National Audubon Society
lobbyist Tom Adams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we've got a budget surplus and the Everglades is being
cut,'' Adams said. ``It makes very little sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists and politicians _ including U.S. Sens. Bob
Graham, a Democrat, and Connie Mack, a Republican _ have said
they'll try to restore at least some of the money. GOP
gubernatorial candidate Jeb Bush also wrote to House Speaker Newt
Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott in July, asking them
to restore the $27 million that the Kissimmee River project needs.
</P>
<P>
   The final numbers will come from House-Senate conference
committees with heavy input from the White House. The Senate is
already back from its summer break, and the House returns
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   During the budget year starting Oct. 1, the White House plan
would spend $224 million on the corps' and Interior Departments'
Everglades-related projects. House proposals would reduce that to
$103 million while the Senate's would spend $142 million.
</P>
<P>
   Both congressional versions would ax a huge chunk of proposed
spending for Everglades land and the corps while leaving largely
intact the proposed budget for Everglades National Park.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmental lobbyists say the debate has little to do
with the merits of restoring the Everglades, and a lot to do with
the wider Clinton-Congress struggle.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Clinton's budget would have steered the corps
toward environmental restoration while slashing the beach, dredging
and flood-control projects that give congressmen something to boast
about back home. The House Appropriations Committee blasted the
proposal as ``breathtaking in its recklessness.''
</P>
<P>
   House appropriators also rejected Clinton's Interior budget
because they said it included $9 billion that mostly would come
from raising cigarette taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The Everglades also may be a victim of bad timing.
</P>
<P>
   The House Appropriations Committee said it would grant more
money for Everglades land only when the Interior Department
finishes spending $200 million that Congress awarded in 1996.
Interior expects to spend the last $133 million on Talisman Sugar
Co.'s empire in Palm Beach County _ but not until December.
</P>
<P>
   A key House subcommittee chairman, Ralph Regula, R-Ohio, also
wants to see a concrete Everglades restoration plan, a staff member
said. The corps is scheduled to submit such a plan in July.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, environmentalists say the Florida Legislature is to
blame for not heeding their warnings last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators passed two bills this year that would have increased
the cost of buying Everglades land and allowed the state to
scrutinize federal restoration plans. Gov. Lawton Chiles vetoed
both bills, but Everglades supporters say the measures already did
their damage on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The members up here on the Appropriations Committee were very
aware of (those bills),'' said U.S. Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr., R-Fort
Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said the bills played into the hands of some congressmen
from other states, who were looking for excuses to spend less in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of people who say, `I like the Everglades but I
like my back yard even better,' '' Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hardest hit projects would be the Kissimmee
restoration, which aims to undo the damage the corps did 30 years
ago when it straightened the winding river into a stagnant canal.
The project also is crucial to reducing pollution of Lake
Okeechobee, scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   After crawling along since the 1980s, the project is ready for
its first major fix: the filling of 9 miles of Kissimmee canal. But
that work can't begin without the entire $27 million that the
administration requested, said Kathy Copeland of the South Florida
Water Management District.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the House proposal would spend $3 million while the
Senate's offers $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Also at risk are more than a dozen regional projects, including
some that would build a reservoir on 10-Mile Creek in St. Lucie
County, reduce pollution of Lake Okeechobee, restore Loxahatchee
Slough in Palm Beach County and kill invasive melaleuca trees.
</P>
<P>
   Congress promised $75 million in 1996 to pay for such projects,
but so far it has granted only $10 million _ and the program
expires next year. The Senate proposal would spend an additional
$10 million, the House only $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Copeland said some projects, such as 10-Mile Creek, are so
important that the district will probably do them even without
money from Congress. But others may fall by the wayside.
</P>
<P>
   The projects' fate may depend on whether the White House,
distracted by the president's political troubles, takes a firm
stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Clinton can draw a line in the sand on the Everglades and
say, `This is not enough,' we've got a lot of leverage,'' said
World Wildlife Fund lobbyist Ron Tipton.

 &HT;    Key assets: Sushi, sun &AMP; serenity
 &HT;    By Sandy Cohen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY LARGO, Fla. _ It was the sushi restaurant that did it.
</P>
<P>
   OK, I admit that it's a little weird to choose a place to stay
solely because there's raw fish nearby.
</P>
<P>
   But as soon as I heard the Marina Del Mar Bayside Resort had a
fine Japanese restaurant _ my favorite food _ right there on the
premises, I called to make a reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the restaurant, the beauty of this place has nothing
to do with the rooms, and everything to do with real estate _
location, location, location. And I'm not talking about the busy
intersection out front and the Burger King next door. It's what's
out back that counts.
</P>
<P>
   We tumbled into our room long enough to don swimsuits. It was
small _ no balcony, no frills and a bit dark. There was just enough
room for two double beds, a table and wicker chairs and armoire
with TV. But it was clean, and I could tell the cool tile floors
and darkness might feel good after a few hours in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Swimsuits on, towels and sunglasses in hand, we hiked around
back and _ bingo! This was the Keys.
</P>
<P>
   A small swimming pool jiggled with kids bobbing and diving,
their parents leaning lazily against the sides. Across a small
beach, a group of middle-aged women bounced around in the shallow
water next to the dock, talking and laughing.
</P>
<P>
   I decked out on my shaded lounge chair and enjoyed the sun
sparkling off the water and the view of Everglades National Park
islands across Florida Bay.
</P>
<P>
   I heard one woman repeat like a mantra, ``I'm so relaxed. I'm so
relaxed.'' Maybe it had something to do with the tiki bar next door
and the 95-degree heat, but everyone here was relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   That night we ventured across A1A to visit the sister resort,
the Marina Del Mar Resort and Marina, which has a full-service
marina, much larger pool, restaurant and cocktail lounge. It was
bustling with organized activities such as aquasize and swimming
lessons. We left feeling happy that we'd ended up at our quiet
hideaway across the road.
</P>
<P>
   What wasn't quiet was the Sushi Nami Japanese restaurant. At 9
p.m. on a Friday, it was as crowded as a big-city eatery _ and with
good reason. The California rolls, soba noodles and other dishes
were wonderful _ and we were lucky enough to sit on cushions at a
low table with a view of the sushi chefs at work.
</P>
<P>
   And we really didn't come just for the food. We also wanted our
kids to try snorkeling. So the next day, we drove to John Pennekamp
State Park, a couple miles away, where we also canoed the mangrove
trail. The shallow, rocky beach at the park was perfect for our
daughters, 4 and 7, who explored the ocean without having to endure
the 3-hour round trip boat ride to the reef.
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon at the resort we chatted with a couple from London
who had driven down after a week at Walt Disney World. Next time,
they said, they'd spend their whole vacation at Marina Del Mar and
other spots in the Keys. Smart move.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   Getting there: Take Florida's Turnpike south to U.S. 1 until you
get to Key Largo. Marina Del Mar Bayside Resort is at Mile Marker
99.5. Call (800) 242-5229.
</P>
<P>
   Rooms: The resort has 54 rooms, and two one-bedroom bayfront
villas. The villas have kitchens and balconies.
</P>
<P>
   Rates: The standard room rate starting Monday, except for
holidays and special event days, is $79 during the week and $89 for
weekends. Villas, which sleep four, are $159 weekdays, $169 on
weekends. These rates run through the third week in December.
</P>
<P>
   Extras: Continental breakfast in the lobby. Charter and rental
boats, along with a dive shop, tennis courts and a fitness center
are available at the sister property, Marina Del Mar Resort and
Marina (800) 451-3483.
</P>
<P>
   John Pennekamp State Park is about 2 miles away, at Mile Marker
102.5, and offers diving, snorkeling, boating, fishing and
swimming. Get there early, especially on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants: Sushi Nami Japanese Restaurant, (305) 453-9798,
offers an impressive selection of sushi and Japanese food for lunch
and dinner. It is right next to the lobby of Marina Del Mar
Bayside.
</P>
<P>
   For a Key West-style breakfast, lunch or dinner, go to Mrs.
Mac's (305) 451-3722, at Mile Marker 99.4. We had delicious fresh
fish sandwiches and onion rings, and huge iced teas.
</P>
<P>
   The Fish House, (305) 451-4665, Mile Marker 102.4 on the ocean
side, is a family restaurant that also serves good, reasonably
priced food.

 &HT;    Now, for Boomer women, there's `More' to read
 &HT;    By Loretta Grantham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just when you think stuffed newsstand shelves can't possibly
bulge another inch, there's More.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine _ aimed at women ages 40 to 60 _ debuts today with
Baby-Boomer poster child Cybill Shepherd on the cover. There are
stories on menopause (``The Hormone Chronicles''), Viagra (``Be
Careful What You Wish For''), style (``4 Women, 1 Suit'') and more
(no pun intended).
</P>
<P>
   ``By 2010, women from 45 to 64 will be the largest and richest
demographic group in American history,'' says Susan Crandell, 47,
executive editor of Ladies' Home Journal, which produces More.
``They have more money, more time and better health, and they feel
very differently about aging than their mothers did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gail Sheehy (the author of Passages) calls it `The New Math.'
Now, when we're 50, we feel and act 40; when we're 40, we feel and
act 30.''
</P>
<P>
   Feelings and action are covered in More, too. ``Ask Mrs.
Robinson'' is a monthly advice column on ``life, love and sex,''
and in the premiere October issue, an article entitled ``She Sure
Can Pick 'Em'' tells you how to act like a market analyst when
buying stock.
</P>
<P>
   Myrna Blyth is editor-in-chief and publishing director.
</P>
<P>
   ``Magazines court and report on the 14- to 40-year-olds,'' she
says. ``Why not do a magazine for Baby Boomers who have been and
continue to be different from other generations?''
</P>
<P>
   (Lear's, you may recall, tried but didn't succeed. It folded in
1994.)
</P>
<P>
   More features ``real women'' as well as professional models, all
over age 40. Cheryl Tiegs and Lauren Hutton, for example, were on
the two test-issue covers.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between LHJ and More, both produced by Meredith
Corp., is their approach to stories, Crandell says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take breast cancer, for instance. Ladies' Home Journal would
have a strong service angle, like how to examine yourself for a
lump, while More would have an issue-type story _ one that talks
about how nobody discussed breast cancer in the '70s, but today,
it's one of the largest money-raising causes.''
</P>
<P>
   Another difference is that the average More reader is more apt
to be college educated and have a higher income than a reader of
LHJ, Blythe says. While LHJ is monthly and has a circulation of
4.5million, More will publish 500,000 issues every other month.
</P>
<P>
   With ``smart talk for smart women'' as its motto, More takes
into account that women don't necessarily follow the prescribed
order of the past, Crandell says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be you went to high school, then college, then got
married, then had children. But I recently went to my 25th college
reunion, and there was a woman there who had a son who'd just
graduated from college and another woman who had infant twins.''
</P>
<P>
   The kickoff issue has articles about Tipper Gore, Carol Burnett
and her daughter, and the ex-Mrs. Robert James Waller, who had a
nasty split from the author of The Bridges of Madison County.
</P>
<P>
   There's also an article on second careers and a monthly piece
called ``She's Got Style,'' in which six savvy ``real women'' _
featured in their own clothes _ reveal their fashion philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our magazine, everything isn't glossed over and made
perfect, nor is it `I'm getting old, I'm depressed,''' Crandell
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to think of it as rosy realism.''

 &HT;    Next stop . . . These are New York Apple Tour's most popular bus
stops
 &HT;    By Cheryl Blackerby
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The big, red double-decker bus came to a stop in
Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Half the tourists got off, and another crowd scrambled on,
racing each other for the second level, which was open-air _
similar to riding around in the back of a pickup truck if a pickup
was 10 feet off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The bus zipped down Seventh Avenue, the top deck now packed with
Italian and French tourists and a tour guide who stood by the rail
and spoke into a microphone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventy percent of all women's clothes made in the U.S. are
made in this area, which is called the Garment District,'' he said,
as his audience's heads spun, getting quick looks at warehouses and
men pushing racks of clothes down the streets.
</P>
<P>
   The bus picked up speed as it made several green lights in a
row. Everyone gasped as a stoplight missed the guide's head by what
appeared to be inches.
</P>
<P>
   The bus made a sharp turn onto 34th Street. ``And here we are at
Macy's department store,'' he said. The Italian tourists jumped
off, while another group, most holding big Macy's shopping bags,
got on.
</P>
<P>
   The big red bus took off again.
</P>
<P>
   ``And up ahead is the Empire State Building.'' Heads snapped
left and right before the tourists realized they needed to look up,
their heads bent back in yoga positions to see the top of the
building. ``It was commissioned in 1929 and finished in 1931. It
went up a floor per day. A lady once jumped off the top floor, and
the wind blew her back into the building.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow,''said a teenager, clearly awed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hmmmmmm,'' said everyone else, nodding in amazement.
</P>
<P>
   The bus stopped, and several families hurried off.
</P>
<P>
   And so it went throughout a sunny late-summer day, as the bus
cruised through lower Manhattan, up to Midtown, around Central
Park, up into Harlem and over to the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   New York Apple Tours, which started the hop-on, hop-off bus
tours in New York City seven years ago, has a fleet of 75
double-decker buses that tour Manhattan and part of Brooklyn every
day, making 65 stops at the city's most famous, and not so famous,
attractions.
</P>
<P>
   The company bought the double-deckers in London and brought them
to New York, and they've been a part of the scenery ever since.
Gray Line and New York Doubledecker also have the buses.
</P>
<P>
   The tour pass _ $35 for adults, $22 for children under 12 _ is
good for two days and one night, and you can hop on and off at any
of the stops.
</P>
<P>
   You might, say, have breakfast in Seinfeld's neighborhood in the
Upper West Side, hop on the bus and get off for some shopping in
SoHo, stop in Battery Park for a trip to the Statue of Liberty, get
back on for a late lunch at South Street Seaport and go up to
Central Park . . .
</P>
<P>
   Popular stops on my trip were the World Trade Center, Battery
Park, Wall Street, Times Square, Central Park and the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The guide kept up a friendly running commentary, telling us that
14th Street was at the widest part of the island (2.3 miles); what
the purpose of all those rainbow-colored flags at restaurants in
the West Village were (they mean they're gay-friendly); that
Broadway runs from the tip of Manhattan all the way up to Albany
(140 miles); and all the places he had tried to get apartments but
was turned down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody worried about crime?'' he asked, and several hands
shot up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crime here is the lowest of any metropolitan city. It's lower
than Boise, Idaho; so, when you're in Boise, hold onto your
purses.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out New York University and mentioned that Spike Lee,
Oliver Stone and Martin Scorsese had studied there. Passengers on
the top level started taking pictures as if Spike was walking on
the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   We all tried to take pictures of the Municipal Building, a
neoclassical high-rise built in 1914. A cluster of 10-story towers
tops the building like a wedding cake. In fact, thousands of
couples marry here each year in a civil chapel on the second floor.
</P>
<P>
   But the bus was too fast for us to snap the whole building. We
had to settle for a photo of the door as we raced past.
</P>
<P>
   And we got whiplash on Wall Street, as we strained to see
Trinity Church behind the bus and Federal Hall National Memorial _
the statue of George Washington marks the spot where the
Revolutionary War general became the country's first president _ to
the left.
</P>
<P>
   At times like these, it's best to get off, take a look around
and catch the next bus, which comes every 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The tour serves as a great overview. The guide pointed out the
jazz bars on Bleecker Street, and a man jotted down the location
for future reference. A woman made a note of the location of
Bergdorf Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for myself, I simply enjoyed riding around Manhattan,
wind in my hair and the world's most interesting city at my feet. I
didn't have the hassle of catching cabs or subways, and could save
my energy for the next day, when I would actually get off the bus
and walk around. If you go
</P>
<P>
   Tours: New York Apple Tours, (800) 876-9868. The Full City Tour
around Manhattan takes about five hours if you don't get off. The
$35 pass includes the night buses and the Brooklyn tour. The
Brooklyn tour takes about 2 1/2 hours. You change buses in Battery
Park for Brooklyn. The daytime buses operate from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.
The last night tour is 8 p.m. You can combine the bus tours with
tours of the Statue of Liberty, helicopter and cruise tours, and
the Harlem Gospel Express (offered every Sunday and Wednesday
mornings).
</P>
<P>
   You can order tickets in advance or buy them at certain bus
stops. You receive a map when you buy a ticket. Brochures and tour
maps are also available at most hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Other tour companies offering double-decker buses are Gray Line,
(212) 397-2600, and New York Doubledecker Tours, (212) 967-6008.

 &HT;    Good night, sweet prince
 &HT;    By Jef Moskot
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I got that phone call last October, I never expected things
to get this out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   It was a friend of mine from Orlando, calling to report the bad
news splashed on the front page of the paper: Mr. Toad's Wild Ride
was going to be replaced by a Winnie the Pooh ride.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't believe it! The Ride had always been my favorite
thing in Walt Disney World, and, indeed, one of my favorite things
in the whole world, ever since I was a little kid.
</P>
<P>
   I clearly remember holding on to my father's arm for protection
while we laughed and laughed at all there was to see. Excited
chickens. Weasels. Gunplay. A naked lady. Satan!
</P>
<P>
   The Ride was a rite of passage, a thrill ride for those who
weren't as tall as the bottom of the sign.
</P>
<P>
   How could Disney kill Toad?
</P>
<P>
   I immediately called Disney and expressed my displeasure.
</P>
<P>
   ``No decision has been made at this time,'' they said, regarding
the fate of Toad Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, I discovered there was a Web site to urge Toad
fans to complain to Disney.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, www.savetoad.com grew. Our forum, the Electronic Toad
Hall, features more than 600 entries. These customer comments were
mailed in batches of 100 to seven Disney corporate weasels,
including Michael Eisner, as well as two Disney departments.
</P>
<P>
   And still nothing more than a glorified form letter in response:
``No decision has been made at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   We decided we had to do more. We had to protest in the real
world _ get some press! And if we were going to protest, we needed
shirts and something to distribute. So we printed up shirts that
read ``Ask me why Mickey is killing Mr. Toad.'' We designed
postcards, simply pleading, ``Please do not destroy Mr. Toad's Wild
Ride!''
</P>
<P>
   At the first ``Toad In'' in December, people were very nervous.
No one knew if we were going to get thrown out of the Magic Kingdom
or maybe even arrested. And, of course, these were Disney fans on
vacation, not professional activists.
</P>
<P>
   We had to be polite but firm. Disney security soon discovered
that we were happy to work with them.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't want to ruin anyone's vacation, we just wanted people
to know what Disney was up to.
</P>
<P>
   Our protests got larger. We distributed more postcards. We hired
a plane to fly a banner over the Magic Kingdom that read ``Save Mr.
Toad's Wild Ride!''
</P>
<P>
   We got our press. E-mails rolled in daily from all over the
world.
</P>
<P>
   So far, we've distributed more than 9,000 ``Save the Toad''
postcards and sold more than 250 T-shirts. There are more than
1,300 people on the Save Toad mailing list.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, I check my in box and get angry all over again. Every
day someone hears about this for the first time and is just as
upset as I was back in October. Every day I read messages filled
with words like ``heartbroken,'' ``travesty'' and some other words
that aren't very polite.
</P>
<P>
   Every day I read stories of those who experienced their first
kiss or their last happy days with their grandparents on The Ride.
Stories of the wonder they experienced when they went on The Ride
for the first time with their parents and the reflection of that
joy in their own children's eyes 20 years later.
</P>
<P>
   Crude letters from little kids who can barely type and desperate
letters from people who were moved to tears when they heard the
news.
</P>
<P>
   Letters from Disney employees who can't believe what their
bosses have done, thanking me profusely for stepping up and trying
to do something about it.
</P>
<P>
   Even as I write this, my in box is constantly beeping, letting
me know that someone else has just discovered Disney's evil scheme.
</P>
<P>
   And I am reminded of the last time I rode The Ride without a
cloud over my head, just a few weeks before I knew about Toad's
impending doom.
</P>
<P>
   I enjoyed it just as much as when I was kid. Even now I see
things in it that I hadn't seen before. Even now I love the spirit
of The Ride.
</P>
<P>
   It's edgy, but not at all cynical. It just keeps getting better
with age.
</P>
<P>
   Jef Moskot, 26, is a computer specialist and film student at the
University of Miami. He and J.T. Toad's most loyal fans will make
one last protest and take one last spin on the wild ride today at 5
p.m. in the Magic Kingdom.

 &HT;    Requiem for Mr. Toad
 &HT;    By Paul Lomartire
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who is Mr. Toad and why does he take a wild ride?
</P>
<P>
   To analyze the amphibian psyche, one must refer to The Wind in
the Willows, the 1908 children's book by Kenneth Grahame.
</P>
<P>
   Grahame's Mr. Toad is no prince.
</P>
<P>
   He steals cars. He wrecks them. He fights with the police. He's
got a bad attitude. He's an affront to the animal kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   In The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad, a cartoon released by
Disney in 1949, the film's narrator calls J. Thaddeus Toad ``a
disturbing factor, a reckless adventurer, having a positive mania
for fads while never counting the cost.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's why Mr. Toad's Wild Ride, which opened at Disneyland
in 1955 and at Disney World in 1971, sends guests hurtling through
Toad Hall and environs in runaway motor cars.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Toad's driving adventure follows a zigzag track to Nowhere
in Particular. You pass through rooms lit by black lights where
riders ``crash'' through a fireplace, a haystack, a barn door and a
coop of chickens.
</P>
<P>
   What happens to Toads who speed around in stolen cars? Disaster,
of course.
</P>
<P>
   Riders end up in a Disney version of hell, complete with bright
red, smiling devils.
</P>
<P>
   The moral of Toad's story: If you play, you must pay. Mr. Toad
must atone for his motor mania!
</P>
<P>
   And today brings Mr. Toad's ultimate atonement: He's being shut
down to make way for a Winnie the Pooh ride.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out recklessness and a wanton disregard for authority
weren't Mr. Toad's biggest problems.
</P>
<P>
   He just didn't sell enough souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   Other Disney attractions that have faded from the Kingdom
</P>
<P>
   20,000 Leagues Under the Sea
</P>
<P>
   Mission to Mars (replaced by Alien Encounter)
</P>
<P>
   Take Flight (to be replaced by Buzz Lightyear's Space Ranger
Spin in November)
</P>
<P>
   America the Beautiful by Monsanto 360-degree movie (replaced by
Timekeeper 360-degree movie)
</P>
<P>
   Kermit beware: Pooh invades toad territory
</P>
<P>
   Beginning next summer, The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh
occupies the spot vacated by Mr. Toad. The new ride will take
guests through the Hundred-Acre Wood in vehicles shaped like
``hunny'' pots. They'll cruise past Owl's toppling house, save
Piglet from rising water in a Floody Place _ and finally arrive
alive at a party with Pooh and friends Eeyore, Gopher, Owl, Rabbit
and Tigger.
</P>
<P>
   No one at Disney will admit it, but ...
</P>
<P>
   The fine line between a Magic Kingdom ride that's a timeless
classic or time bomb seems tied to T-shirts, caps and cups.
</P>
<P>
   Count the number of rides in which you don't exit into a
souvenir store or stand selling the ride's characters.
</P>
<P>
   There are no Mr. Toad souvenirs at Disney World because, said
several employees, there is no demand.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Toad is one of three ``dark rides'' Disneyland developed in
the '50s. Snow White's Adventures and Peter Pan's Flight are the
others.
</P>
<P>
   Though Snow White is as old as Mr. Toad, souvenirs tied to the
Prince-starved Miss White and her pack of midgets still sell well.
Peter and Tinkerbell do, too.
</P>
<P>
   Without souvenir sales, a ride needs corporate cash. It's A
Small World sells no sizzle _ but the ride is presented by Mattel
Toys.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Toad's only hope for a corporate angel would seem to have
been fond-of-frogs Budweiser. (But behind-the-scenes, insanely
jealous frog-hater Louie the Lizard may have queered any chance at
a deal.)

 &HT;    New view: Hook 'em high, hook 'em posh
 &HT;    By Don McLeese
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The new era of Longhorn football is
air-conditioned. It is cherrywood paneled in its halls and Berber
carpeted in its suites. It is wet-barred, kitchenetted and
cocktailed.
</P>
<P>
   It offers ``concierge custom service,'' which will arrange for
dry cleaning if you spill something on your jacket, and it has
custom catering, through which you can change your menu game by
game. It has windows you can open by pressing a button, if you miss
the noise of the crowd and the band. It has secured elevators to
take you to your private entrance, and a private washroom once you
arrive.
</P>
<P>
   It is 675 square feet of tasteful splendor, and it won't cost
you a penny _ if you are corporately connected to someone who has
authorized this expenditure, 50 grand or more per season (plus the
price of tickets). Or if you are doing some very significant
business with a company that has committed to the skybox splurge.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a corporate feel up here, because people want to do
business and entertain clients,'' said Chris Plonsky, associate
athletic director, who still has 20 of those 50 new suites on the
east side of Royal-Memorial Stadium available for multi-season
rental. ``We had one fellow tell us last year that he paid for his
(west side) suite with all the orders he took in one game. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to tell you that I'm not worried (about the empty
rentals), but I feel good that the potential will be realized,''
she said. ``We opened a whole lot of inventory all at once. After
people arrive today, these suites are going to start going fast and
furious. People are starting to eye next year's schedule, and
everybody feels so dang good about Mack Brown. And once these
suites are gone, they won't open up.''
</P>
<P>
   Suite 954 was filled with satisfied customers, employees and
guests of BMC Software, a Houston-based company that has an Austin
office of 440 workers. The firm decided to turn the suite into an
employee perk, with a drawing for pairs of tickets. None of those
attending had ever experienced a UT game in such style.
</P>
<P>
   ``The morale of our employees is really important to us,'' said
Dan Hoffman, research and development manager. ``We want them to
really feel part of Austin and part of BMC. We consider this great
business because it's great for employees. It's good that business
is good.''
</P>
<P>
   One employee brought his daughter, another invited a UT business
professor. Austin site manager Betty Otter-Nickerson estimated that
one-third of the company's Austin work force attended UT. Between
bites of brisket and sips of Shiner or cabernet, they cheered as
loud as the folks in the upper deck.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the upper deck. Once I'd weaseled my way into the inner
sanctum of the stadium suites, I never wanted to leave. Not even
after the game was over. I could get used to this. And as long as
you're up, buddy, could you mix me another martini?
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the new era of Longhorn football also includes a
new level atop the skyboxes, a deck that blocks the previously
sanctified view of the Capitol. There was no elevator leading up
there, only a seemingly endless extension of ramps. The air was not
conditioned. In contrast with the chardonnay imbibers down below,
the upper deck was the ``let 'em drink sweat'' section.
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, however, and sweat be darned, the view from those
seats was pretty good as well. Especially at student prices _ a $60
activity fee that covers all sports admissions for the year. There
is no truth to the rumor that one can see Round Rock better than
the field from the deck's student seats.
</P>

 &HT;    Researchers follow a colorful migration
 &HT;    By Dick Stanley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ With the audible whisper of millions of beating
wings, Monarch butterflies have begun leaving Canada and Minnesota,
forming up and heading south in their annual migration to Mexico
for the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Although the distinctive orange-and-black butterflies aren't
expected to begin passing through Texas in large numbers before the
end of the month, some early arrivals, called breeders, are already
laying eggs on flowering milkweed in bar ditches and pastures
throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists who have been studying the migrations for the past
five years, aided by thousands of American and Mexican
schoolchildren and adult volunteers, want help in counting the
Texas breeders and the caterpillar larvae hatched from their eggs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to encourage people to report the presence of adults
or larvae now to our hotline, at 1-800-468-9719, particularly
larvae,'' said William Calvert, an entomologist with the Texas
Parks &AMP; Wildlife Department. In Austin, the number is 326-2231.
</P>
<P>
   Pictures of Monarchs, their larvae and some of the many species
of flowering milkweed found in Texas are available at
ron.nhm.ukans.edu/ 7/8monarch on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Some breeder Monarchs may have a round plastic tag on one wing,
put there by volunteers, and scientists want to know the
information on the tag. Tag reading is easier in the morning before
the heat-sensitive butterflies get active.
</P>
<P>
   Monarch larvae, or caterpillars, have white, yellow and black
stripes, and two sets of black antennae, a feature that
distinguishes them from the Queen butterfly's larvae, which are
similar but have three sets of black antennae. The caterpillars
spin a silk covering around themselves, from which adult
butterflies eventually emerge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know so little about this (migratory) phenomenon,'' Calvert
said, ``although we've learned some remarkable things in the last
few years.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when the southbound Monarchs begin crossing the
Red River between Texas and Oklahoma in the last week of September,
90 percent of them will converge and follow a path roughly 300
miles wide from Wichita Falls to Del Rio. Some will be seen as far
east as the Austin area, mainly around Lake Travis, if early cold
fronts blow them off course.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, the southbound butterflies have never been in Texas
or Mexico. They are the great-great-grandchildren of Monarchs that
passed through on their way north in the spring, yet they follow
the same path as their ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear to us now that they (somehow) use the sun as a
compass,'' Calvert said, ``in flying 2,000 miles to find nine tiny
wintering locations in the mountains of Mexico without having been
there before.''
</P>
<P>
   Other species of butterflies also migrate. But apparently none
of them does it the way Monarchs do, with the same individuals
making a two-way trip.
</P>
<P>
   While most butterflies, including some Monarchs, live for only
four to five weeks, most of the northern-born Monarchs live from
eight to nine months. Heading south in late summer, those who
arrive in Mexico will spend the winter in dense forests in
mountains about 130 miles west of Mexico City. In the spring, they
will head back north, mating, laying eggs and dying, mainly in the
Great Lakes region, during the late spring and summer. Their
descendents will repeat the two-way migration.
</P>
<P>
   From 150 million to 300 million Monarchs have made the trips in
recent years, but Chip Taylor, an entomologist at the University of
Kansas who heads Monarch Watch, expects to see fewer than 100
million heading south this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``El Nin(tilde)o gave them an extraordinarily dry winter in
Mexico last year,'' Taylor said. ``They were in bad shape as they
came out, and they had to run a gantlet of 400 to 600 miles of
Mexico that had had no rain in four to five months to get into
Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   They enjoyed generally moist summer conditions in their northern
breeding range, but, faced with the usual predators and parasites,
their population didn't increase much from the low spring numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the weather this winter, Monarch wintering grounds in a
densely populated area of rural Mexico are endangered. Although the
Mexicans are planting trees and patrolling the area to keep the
wintering Monarchs safe, local residents depend on the trees for
construction lumber, for roof shingles, and to sell each year for
crop seeds and fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Monarch has become a symbol of the delicacy of nature,''
Calvert said. ``If the overwintering sites are wiped out, the
massive migration will disappear and we'll lose a wonderful
phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   To help scientists count early-arriving adult Monarchs and their
larvae, call the Texas Monarch Watch hotline at (800) 468-9719.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A on the news
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com

<P>
   Q: The latest unrest in Russia makes me wonder: Whatever
happened to the body of Communist leader Vladimir Lenin? Can the
public still view it, or has it been removed and buried?
</P>
<P>
   A: Lenin's preserved corpse, waxy faced and clad in a suit,
remains on display in a glass tomb in a shrine in Red Square in
Moscow, where it has been viewed by millions of people. But it may
not be there forever. Russian President Boris Yeltsin has called
for a nationwide vote on the issue of whether to leave the embalmed
corpse where it has been enshrined for decades, or to bury it.
Yeltsin has said he favors burying Lenin, father of the Bolshevik
revolution, but he wants the country to decide. Lenin died in 1924.
The Central Lenin Museum in Red Square, by the way, simply closed
down after the August 1991 coup, ``pending reconstruction.'' It
remains closed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the academic and other qualifications to become a
White House intern? Why was Monica Lewinsky hired?
</P>
<P>
   A: White House interns, most of whom are 18 to 23, must have a
strong academic background, a demonstrated interest in government
and politics, and be willing to work long hours. The program is
officially nonpartisan, and therefore presumably open equally to
young Democrats and young Republicans. Applicants submit a college
transcript, resume, essay and two letters of recommendation. Those
admitted undergo drug tests; FBI background checks; screening by
the president's security team and briefings by the FBI, Secret
Service and Metropolitan D.C. police, all of which are designed to
stress the importance of good behavior.
</P>
<P>
   It also helps to have political connections, as White House
press secretary Mike McCurry was quoted a saying in January: ``Many
of them are sons and daughters of supporters. It's not uncommon
that people have connections.'' Lewinsky was hired on the
recommendation of Walter Kaye, a family friend and big contributor
to the Democratic Party. Kaye is a wealthy retired insurance
executive who knew Lewinsky's mother, Marcia Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When we're told by local authorities to boil water from the
tap because it may be contaminated, how long should it boil? After
it has cooled to room temperature, should it be refrigerated? And
after that, how long can it be used for drinking?
</P>
<P>
   A: To be absolutely safe, boil water that may be contaminated
for 10 minutes. The boiled water can be stored indefinitely in
clean containers at room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several years ago, Ted Turner offered a prize for the best
novel set in the future. Was a winner ever announced? Did it sell
well?
</P>
<P>
   A: Daniel Quinn's ``Ishmael'' was declared winner of the
$500,000 Turner Tomorrow Award in June 1991. It was published in
January 1992 in hardback and reissued in 1995 in paperback. The
novel is a series of conversations between a man and a great ape
(named Ishmael) about the state of the world and what can be done
to save it. Simply put, Ishmael's message is that Earth does not
belong to man, but that man belongs to the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn was thrust abruptly into the spotlight when his novel was
selected from more than 2,500 manuscripts in a worldwide
competition, sponsored by Turner, to encourage works of fiction
with creative and positive solutions to global problems. After
publication, ``Ishmael'' languished until Oprah Winfrey announced
that the book had changed her life, and Quinn appeared on her TV
program. Sales soared, and Bantam went back to press with the book
another five times.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What can you tell us about Mark McGwire's early years?
</P>
<P>
   A: McGwire was born Oct. 1, 1963, in Pomona, Calif. A baseball
fan as a boy, Mark David McGwire began playing Little League at 8.
According to the story, in his first at-bat, he hit a home run over
the right-field fence off a 12-year-old pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, he graduated from Damien High School in Claremont,
Calif., where he had developed into a power pitcher. The Montreal
Expos drafted him, but he didn't like Montreal's offer and decided
to go to the University of Southern California, where he gave up
pitching to concentrate on becoming a hitter. In 1984 he hit 32
homers, a USC record. Later that year he played on the U.S. Olympic
baseball team and was drafted by the Oakland Athletics as a
first-round (10th overall) free-agent pick.
</P>
<P>
   He left USC to join the A's minor league system, where he spent
about two years. He was called up to the Major League team near the
end of the 1986 season and played for the A's until signing with
the St. Louis Cardinals late in the 1997 season.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the largest bill in circulation in the United States?
</P>
<P>
   A: A $10,000 Federal Reserve note is the largest U.S. bill, but
the government began withdrawing it and several other large U.S.
bills ($500, $1,000 and $5,000) from circulation in 1969. The $100
note is the largest bill currently being printed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where were the D-Day invasion scenes in ``Saving Private
Ryan'' filmed? Also, surely there are no bombed-out villages left
in Europe from World War II, so where were the location scenes
made?
</P>
<P>
   A: The scenes depicting the invasion of Omaha Beach were shot in
Ireland. Tom Sanders, the movie's production designer, said he
searched all around France, Ireland and England before choosing the
Irish coast. The harbor, the Irish sea, the Irish weather and a
beach that was big enough _ even with the tide out _ all
contributed to the realism the filmmakers sought.
</P>
<P>
   The French village was re-created at an abandoned British
aerospace facility, Hatfield Aerodrome, in Hertfordshire north of
London. It started as a grass field, but when cameras started to
roll it had a full-scale, historically accurate reproduction of a
bombed-out French village and a bridge spanning a river where the
story reaches its climax for Capt. John Miller (Tom Hanks) and his
men. Thame Park in Oxfordshire, England, provided the setting for
several scenes, including an intense skirmish between Miller's
squad and a German machine-gun nest.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I think Lynne Russell of CNN Headline News is the most
beautiful woman on television. What is her background?
</P>
<P>
   A: For more than a decade, Russell has been the prime-time
weekday evening anchor on Headline News, CNN's sister service.
Before that, she spent six years as co-host with Bob Cain on CNN's
``The Week in Review.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell attended the University of Colorado, where she majored
in nursing. From 1971 to 1978, she was program director, as well as
anchor and host, of a news and interview program at WKAT, a Miami
talk radio station. In 1978 and '79, she anchored and reported at
WTLV-TV in Jacksonville, Fla. After a year as a news anchor and
military correspondent for KHON-TV in Honolulu, she joined KENS-TV
in San Antonio as an evening news anchor and investigative and
courthouse reporter. In 1983, she moved to CNN.
</P>
<P>
   She's a licensed private investigator who works part-time as a
detective. She's a first-degree black belt in Choi Kwang-Do; a
bodyguard to visiting celebrities; and a Fulton County deputy
sheriff in the reserve division. She also is certified as an
open-water scuba diver.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read about a survivalist suspected of murdering two campers
in the North Carolina woods. He then disappeared, supposedly to
prove he could survive in the wild as well as bombing suspect Eric
Robert Rudolph. Was he ever caught?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. The suspect, James Andrew Finley Jr., was captured Aug.
5. Finley, 21, of Hickory, N.C., was charged in the slaying of
Andrew Marston and Tommi Danielle Byrd, both 24, a Charlotte couple
found shot and slashed to death Aug. 2 in the Linville Gorge
Wilderness Area.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Finley's acquaintances had described him as an admirer
of Rudolph, the North Carolina man who has eluded an intensive
manhunt in the Nantahala National Forest since being accused of the
Jan. 29 bombing of a Birmingham abortion clinic. The acquaintances,
according to authorities, said Finley, an experienced outdoorsman,
bragged that he, too, could escape capture.
</P>
<P>
   Finley remains held without bond in Morganton, N.C., said Capt.
Pat Messick of the Burke County Sheriff's Department. Officers will
seek a grand jury indictment on the federal level Sept. 15, he
added, noting that the murders occurred on federal property.
</P>
<P>
   Q: One day, when I checked after the stock market had been open
for 40 minutes, a particular stock I was interested in still was
not open. Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: Such a delayed opening isn't uncommon. Myron Greene,
publisher of the Mutual Fund Timing Guide and business professor
emeritus at Georgia State University, said it happens mainly when
there's an imbalance between the number of buy orders and sell
orders, and often results from an unexpected announcement by a
company _ for example, when it's reporting unexpectedly good
earnings. Such an announcement might spark an influx of orders to
buy when there aren't enough matching orders to sell, so to prevent
a disruption in the trading of that stock, its opening is delayed
or, if the stock already has opened, trading is suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There are signs in hospitals warning against using cell
phones. Why is that?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's possible for cellular phones to interfere with equipment
such as ventilators and balloon and fusion pumps, as well as
telemetry. Cell phones could cause erratic signals or alarms in the
machines, possibly making a ventilator deliver an extra breath,
say. So in the interest of patient care, their use is forbidden.
The use of cell phones also is prohibited on board aircraft, by the
way, for a similar reason: possible interference with navigational
equipment and electrical systems.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the name of the firm Dow Jones &AMP; Co., I know about Charles
Dow. But who was Jones?
</P>
<P>
   A: Edward T. Jones was one of the founders of the company in
1882, along with Dow and a third person whose name would have
complicated things a bit: Charles Bergstresser.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A on the news

 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED: Q: In the name of the firm Dow Jones &AMP; Co., I know
about Charles Dow. But who was Jones?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has Bill Gates of Microsoft made any public comments about
the Y2K problem?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, but if you're hoping Gates could offer a quick fix,
you'll be disappointed. In a question and answer column Gates wrote
about Y2K, he began by stating what is well known: ``The Year 2000
problem is caused by the use in software of two-digit dates, such
as 01, to stand for years. When we go from 1999 to 2000, two-digit
dates become ambiguous. . . . Mainframes are the most severely
affected, in part because two-digit usage was common in older
systems where memory was limited due to high costs. Because the
problem could lurk anywhere in very complex code, the hardest part
about a solution is finding all the places where it occurs.''
</P>
<P>
   His assessment, shared by many others: ``There will be a
headache, but how much pain it will cause remains to be seen . . .
but companies all over the world are working hard to prevent it.''
In other words, there's no magic wand.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where did Andres Galarraga, the Atlanta Braves' first
baseman, get the nickname ``Big Cat''?
</P>
<P>
   A: Galarrage is huge (6-foot-3, weighing nearly 250 pounds), yet
he runs well and is unusually graceful, especially on defense.
That's how he got his nickname.
</P>
<P>
   Q: All the attention about the Titanic reminds me of the Edmund
Fitzgerald. I recall that divers were supposed to go down to its
wreckage to try and determine what caused it to sink, but I never
heard their findings. Do you have any details?
</P>
<P>
   A: The only extensive manned expedition to the ship's wreckage
on the floor of Lake Superior took place in July 1994, when
scentists and marine historians on a miniature submarine undertook
a three-day mission to probe the mystery of the Fitzgerald's
sinking on Nov. 10, 1975. Despite intensive searching, no actual
cause was discovered. The two most common theories are that the
ship took on water as 30-foot seas crashed over its side, and
finally nose-dived under a monster wave; and that it hit a poorly
charted shoal, tearing a gash in the hull. In his report on the
dive, Canadian marine scientist Joe MacInnis was quoted as saying:
``We still can't say why the ship went down. The crew had no idea
what happened, it was so sudden, so explosive.'' All 29 crew
members aboard the Fitzgerald were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I don't recall ever reading the exact injuries that caused
Princess Diana's death. Was that information made public?
</P>
<P>
   A: The princess of Wales suffered severe head and chest
injuries. Death was attributed to cardiac arrest resulting from
laceration of the left pulmonary vein (a vessel that transports
oxygenated blood from the lungs). Doctors at Hospital La Pitie
Salpetriere in Paris performed surgery to close the wound and tried
to revive her with chest massage, first externally and then
directly to the heart, but after two hours she was declared dead.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you compare the size, tonnage displacement and passenger
capacity of the Titanic, the first Queen Elizabeth and the Queen
Mary?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 46,328-ton Titanic measured 882 feet, 8 inches long and
92 feet wide, and had a capacity of 2,435 passengers. The
82,997-ton Queen Elizabeth was 1,031 feet long and 118 feet wide
and had a capacity of 2,197 passengers. The 81,237-ton Queen Mary
was 1,019 feet, 6 inches long and 118 feet wide, with a capacity of
1,948 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently reported on prisons used by the Union and the
Confederacy for troops captured in the Civil War. Is there a good
resource book with more information?
</P>
<P>
   A: A number of books dealing with the Civil War have information
about prisons. A good resource is the 1,056-page Historical Times
Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Civil War (Patricia L. Faust,
editor; HarperPerennial). It should be available in libraries or
bookstores, and can be ordered by bookstores using ISBN number
0-06-181261-7. The hardcover was published first in 1986 by Harper
&AMP; Row; the HarperPerennial edition in 1991. It remains in print.
</P>
<P>
   Another recommended book is ``Portals to Hell: Military Prisons
of the Civil War'' (by Lonnie R. Speer; Stackpole Books). Its ISBN
number: 0811703347.
</P>
<P>
   Q: One of the criteria for subjects featured on U.S. postage
stamps is that the subject should be American-related. But an
article about stamps to be chosen as representative of the '70s
showed an image of a KLM airplane as a nominee for a stamp in the
science and technology category. KLM is the Dutch national airline,
so why would it be chosen over a U.S. airline that flies jumbo
jets?
</P>
<P>
   A: The KLM image was intended only to illustrate a jumbo jet,
which is in the science and technology category of nominated
stamps, but the Postal Service has no plans to use it for a stamp
design, said Don Smeraldi of the Postal Service. Since public
voting is still going on for the ``Celebrate the Century'' stamp
program, no designs have been chosen yet, nor will they for ``for a
while,'' Smeraldi added. The issuance of the stamps celebrating the
1970s is expected in September 1999. Post offices are distributing
free brochures about the program, with full details on possible
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   An official ballot is part of the brochure. Those with online
capability can vote at this address: http://stampvote.msn.com Q: I
thought measures had been put into place to stop trading on the
stock market when prices began to fall sharply. Why weren't they on
Aug. 31, the day of the 512-point drop?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're talking about the so-called ``circuit breakers'' put
into effect by the New York Stock Exchange after the stock market
crash in 1987, said Myron Greene, publisher of the Mutual Fund
Timing Guide and business professor emeritus at Georgia State
University. The initial version in 1987 was two-pronged. The first
would have halted trading for 30 minutes if the Dow Jones
Industrial Average fell 350 points; the second for an hour if it
fell 550 points.
</P>
<P>
   But because the Dow gained so much ground in recent times, the
circuit breakers were changed earlier this year from points to
percentages, Greene said. Now, if the Dow were to fall 10 percent,
trading would be suspended for an hour; 20 percent, two hours; 30
percent, the remainder of the day. So to trigger the first tier of
the present circuit breakers, the Dow would need to have fallen
around 800 points Aug. 31; it fell about 512 points, well short of
the level required.
</P>
<P>
   These circuit breakers don't stop prices from falling, as Greene
pointed out; they just suspend trading. ``The idea is to give
investors time to stop and reflect, and sort of eliminate the mood
of hysteria,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know what NASDAQ is, but what do the initials stand for?
</P>
<P>
   A: National Association of Securities Dealers Automated
Quotations.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is an Alford plea?
</P>
<P>
   A: The name is derived from a 1970 Supreme Court case, North
Carolina v. Alford. According to Black's Law Dictionary, the court
held that ``a guilty plea which represented a voluntary and
intelligent choice among alternatives available to the defendant,
especially where he was represented by competent counsel, was not
compelled within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment merely because
the plea was entered to avoid the possibility of the death
penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   An Alford guilty plea is described more simply as a legal
mechanism that allows defendants to plead guilty if they think it
is in their best interest, even if they believe they are innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What happened to the storm between Bonnie and Danielle?
Shouldn't there have been one with a name starting with C?
</P>
<P>
   A: There was such a tropical storm, said Frank Lepore of the
National Hurricane Center in Miami. You just didn't hear the name.
Charley struck the Texas Gulf coast, dropping large amounts of
rain, then dissipated rapidly. The first hurricane of the season
was Alex, which dissipated into a few puffs of wind off the Leeward
Islands in early August.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does the U.S. Postal Service have any plans for using only
ZIP codes after a person's name for the address of domestic mail?
</P>
<P>
   A: Using only a person's or company's name and even a nine-digit
ZIP code wouldn't be sufficient because the code doesn't pinpoint a
specific place, said Sandra Harding of the Postal Service in
Washington. An 11-digit code is more specific, but it's imbedded in
a bar code, and that could fall off an envelope. A ZIP code
supplements the full written street name and house or building
number, Harding said. As a backup, the written address also would
allow the Postal Service to deliver the mail properly if its
automated equipment went down because of a power failure, flood or
other problem, and it allows proper forwarding if someone moves.
ZIP codes alone wouldn't do that.

 &HT;    Weary nation tolerates sin with cynicism
 &HT;    By Karen Hall
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I miss sin.
</P>
<P>
   I'm old enough that I find myself pining for a lot of things. I
miss drive-in movies. I miss ice cream trucks. I miss the E Street
Band. But what I find myself missing most these days, much to my
surprise, is sin.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not talking about the wild days of my misspent youth. I miss
sin as a concept.
</P>
<P>
   I miss moral outrage. If nothing else, it gave us the illusion
that there was something we could do about gross misconduct or
perceived injustices. We could huff and puff and yell and write
letters to the editor. We could shun the depraved. Every now and
then, there would be enough of a grass-roots tempest to launch a
``60 Minutes'' investigation. Those were the days.
</P>
<P>
   I long for the days of yesteryear, when murderers were locked
up, once everyone in the country knew they were murderers. Slapping
them with a huge fine in a civil suit just doesn't have the same
pizzazz. And remember when murder suspects were required to go in
for questioning? Remember when they couldn't avoid it by announcing
that ... well, heck, they just didn't want to?
</P>
<P>
   (Pardon my ignorance of the law, but when did that become an
option? I'm sure there are a lot of people in prison who are
wondering the same thing.)
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Bill Clinton's predicament. I miss the days
when the near-admission of a 52-year-old married president that
he'd had sex with an underling in her early 20s would have made his
approval rating go down just a point or two. I remember the uproar
caused by Jimmy Carter's admission that he had lusted after women
in his heart. These days that wouldn't even make CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere along the way, we have become a nation of moral sloth.
Short of blowing up a day care center, it's impossible to get a
rise out of us anymore. Whenever the transition took place, I must
have been sleeping. I feel like the Rip Van Winkle of scruples,
having suddenly awakened in a land where lying is called
``misleading'' and adultery is known as an ``inappropriate
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Since I know I'm playing catch-up, I'm listening closely to what
people around me are saying. The rationalization that disturbs me
the most is that there's no point in getting upset over Clinton's
misdeeds because everyone in Washington is corrupt and if we get
rid of him, someone just as bad if not worse will take his place.
They say this as if it should comfort me.
</P>
<P>
   See, I'm thinking that if it's true, we should be worried. We
should be yelling for more investigations, not whining about being
tired of the ones that already exist. We should be slowing down and
asking ourselves how it got this way and what we can do about it,
not champing at the bit to ``move on'' and ``get about the work of
the country.'' Since when is investigating allegations of illegal
conduct in the presidency not the ``work of the country'?
</P>
<P>
   My vote for first runner-up in the disturbing rationalization
contest goes to: ``The economy is in good shape, therefore I don't
care about the president's personal life.'' (I'd also like to point
out that for my hard-earned dollars, a president's ``personal
life'' takes place in the living quarters or at Camp David, not in
the study outside the Oval Office while foreign heads of state are
being treated like patients in a dentist's office.)
</P>
<P>
   I felt hopeful last week for the first time in ages, comforted
by the stock market's 512-point plunge. Since our integrity is now
apparently linked to the Dow Jones industrial average, this may be
the first sign of the return of objective morality. Maybe we're
sliding into a recession that will be bad enough to make us raise
an eyebrow or two, or even to once again refer to hideous behavior
as hideous behavior. And if the stock market does a complete crash
and burn?
</P>
<P>
   We might once again be able to call a sin a sin.

 &HT;    Texans told to handle designer lenses with care
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ State health and law enforcement officials are
warning Texans about the dangers of improper use of designer
contact lenses.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Mills, contact lens program administrator for the Texas
Department of Health, said state health officials have received
about a dozen reports of eye infections and injuries in junior high
and high school students caused by wearing fashion contact lenses.
The designer lenses, some of which are being marketed to children,
include bull's-eye and cat's-eye designs, starbursts, other
patterns and colors.
</P>
<P>
   Mills said there's nothing wrong with the contacts, but the
plastic lenses must be prescribed and properly fitted for the
person wearing them. Mills also said contact lenses should never be
shared, a trend that has been reported in some schools.
</P>
<P>
   All of the reported injuries and infections have involved cases
in which doctors were able to correct the problems, Mills said. He
added, however, that in worst-case scenarios, the infections or
injuries could lead to blindness or the loss of an eye.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries or infections have been reported among students in
the Austin Independent School District, and health officials at the
Round Rock and San Marcos school districts said they were unaware
of any cases. Central Texas school officials and students said they
were aware of the lenses but had not heard of any problems
associated with them.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen-year-old Marshall Berliner said it's impossible to miss
the contacts on the McCallum High School campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of think they are cool,'' Berliner said. ``Sometimes
(students) have different-colored eyes. One day they'll wear
purple, and then another day yellow, but I don't know if they
swap.''
</P>
<P>
   Judy Frederick, head of student health at the Austin school
district, said the district is providing information to school
nurses to warn students about misuse of the contacts.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Dusek, a spokesman for Attorney General Dan Morales, said
there have been reports of the fashion lenses being sold at flea
markets and other businesses not licensed to dispense contact
lenses. Dusek said no enforcement action has been started against
any businesses but added that lawsuits would be filed if unlicensed
companies don't stop selling the lenses.
</P>
<P>
   Mills said he's received reports of a flea market dealer in
Austin selling the lenses. Other nonlicensed sources have included
home-based sales, door-to-door handbills and shopper-type
publications, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're requesting school districts not accept these
advertisements without a license number,'' Mills said. ``We'd
really like to see papers of any kind requesting that
information.''
</P>
<P>
   Dusek said the attorney general's office will take whatever
steps necessary to prevent injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our objective is to put a stop to this right now,'' he said.
``If this persists, we'll have to take legal action.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Dugas, of EyeCare Vision Center on Martin Luther King
Jr. Boulevard, said tinted lenses have been available for some time
with little problem. He added, though, that the introduction of
designer lenses with various patterns has raised concerns.
</P>
<P>
   When prescribing the lenses, he said, ``we try to make it clear
that these are yours.''

 &HT;    Surgery can't keep dad down
 &HT;    By Emily J. Minor
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the morning after the day of his emergency surgery, my father
sat up in his hospital bed and did a crossword puzzle between
Demerol hallucinations.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen down. Ten down. Three across.
</P>
<P>
   And then he would rest.
</P>
<P>
   He would stare at the ceiling and imagine there were people in
the hospital room who were not. He talked to Peggy and Lowell, my
parents' neighbors across the hall in their apartment building. He
screamed at my mother, ``Watch out, Nedra. You're going to get hit
in the head with a golf ball.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, lucid again, he would work the puzzle some more.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen across. Seven down.
</P>
<P>
   My father, you see, is an amazing man.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not certain when I realized that he has the strength of a
giant, but I think it might have been fairly recently. In March,
they operated on my dad for an aneurysm on his descending aorta, a
medical condition I am told you don't mess around with. But he,
hands tied, went into training. He walked even more to get himself
fit. He gave up the Camel straights. He smiled and laughed and told
us he'd be OK. At one point, in a rare moment of emotion with this
man I so love, I told him I admired his determination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, honey,'' he said, ``the alternative is pretty bleak.''
</P>
<P>
   The alternative, of course, is death. There, I've said it. And
as far back as I can remember, we've been waiting for this man to
go. In 1970, he suffered a stroke. It was in the basement of our
old house in Ohio, and he and I were the only ones home at the
time. I remember, to this day, how distant and scary his garbled
call for help sounded as I poked my head around into the dark, cold
cellar. I knew something was wrong, terribly wrong, and somehow I
had the strength to do all the right things.
</P>
<P>
   Call for help. Go to his side. Keep my fear at bay until he was
safe in a doctor's arms.
</P>
<P>
   But my father popped back from that, as he would, again and
again, in the days and months and years to come. Turned out, his
stroke occurred from a gunshot wound he'd suffered in the Navy in
1944. He'd been a gunner's mate when a gun had accidentally gone
off in a Norfolk, Va., naval training classroom. The bullet entered
the back of his head, ricocheted off his skull and eventually came
out his cheek.
</P>
<P>
   He lived. But in the years after he left the service _ in the
years that were the prime of his fatherhood _ a sac of blood
collected, unknown, in my father's head. And on that weekday
afternoon when just he and I were home, it burst.
</P>
<P>
   And, then, we began our wait for the old man to die.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he worked for many, many more years. He stayed
physically fit. And he always worked his mind. Good books.
Politics. Golf. The crossword. Two down. Three across. All those
years, you never would have known there was one thing wrong with my
father. And never, ever, did this man complain.
</P>
<P>
   They brought Kenny Smith, age 77, home the other day, all fixed
up and ready to go again. This time, it was an obstructed bowel,
caused by the March surgery, they think.
</P>
<P>
   And that night, happy but exhausted from several days of good
cries, I called everyone who cared and told them the good news.
Grandpa Smith is alive! No funeral. No flowers. No fitting into the
good black dress. Hope burns eternal. Again.

 &HT;    Bootleggers
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ ``Jeff Gordon cheats.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gordon is a dirty driver. Everyone knows that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kid never paid his dues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gordon couldn't win a race without his crew chief, Ray
Everham.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is sick of hearing Gordon praise God for all his
wins.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gordon looks too cute.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All that clean-cut business is a big act.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR Winston Cup champion Jeff Gordon doesn't smoke, drink,
cuss or chew. Gordon's family never made moonshine or ran bootleg
whiskey.
</P>
<P>
   Hell has no fury like a red neck beaten at his own game.
</P>
<P>
   Standing boos greet Gordon at every NASCAR race track south of
the Mason-Dixon line. Curses are shouted at Gordon with eye-bulging
rage.
</P>
<P>
   Because Gordon has never been able to simultaneously scratch his
butt and use bad grammar, he is reviled by many Southern good ol'
boys who see the young man as a threat to their culture.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR fans have always been loyal to certain drivers. I used to
be a Richard Petty fan. In recent years I pull for the Labonte
brothers. They're from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, however, I noticed growing peer pressure
among NASCAR fans to bad mouth Jeff Gordon. The anti-Gordon craze
caught on with a vengeance, and not just with the fans.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR's Winston Cup television announcers can barely disguise
their contempt for this young upstart who dominates their sport.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon was born in Indiana but grew up in California. He raced
go-carts and quarter-midgets at age 5. At age of 8, Gordon was
quarter-midget national champion.
</P>
<P>
   A young Jeff Gordon was the national USAC midget champion as a
teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon won a record 11 poles on the NASCAR Busch Series Grand
National Division circuit in 1992. He was named Winston Cup Rookie
of the Year in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon became the youngest NASCAR Winston Cup Series champion in
the modern era. He now is on his way to becoming the Winston Cup
champion again, which would make two years in a row and three out
of the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone feels culturally threatened by Gordon's phenomenal
success. Plenty of sponsors and race fans who never felt part of
the southern bootlegger background see Gordon as a great American
success story.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans think society is going to hell in an amoral
handbasket. They are looking for a clean-cut, hard-working role
model grounded in spiritual and secular values. That may be
goody-two-shoes for the anti-Gordon crowd, but his continued
success on the track may eventually lift stock car racing far
beyond its bootlegger heritage.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good sport. Like baseball and basketball, stock car
racing is a completely American sport.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans dominate Formula 1 racing. America's open-wheel racing
is going the way of professional boxing with a confusion of
competing championships.
</P>
<P>
   Due to complaints by other Winston Cup drivers and owners,
Gordon's multicolored No. 24 Chevrolet has been stripped apart time
and again by NASCAR officials in an effort to find evidence of
cheating. So far they have found nothing, but that doesn't stop
them from trying.
</P>
<P>
   While Gordon's tires are still being studied due to a complaint
by sore-loser Jack Roush, owner of the cars driven by Mark Martin
and Jeff Burton, NASCAR impounded Gordon's engine along with five
other engines following Gordon's win in at the Pepsi Southern 500
at Darlington Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   This anti-Gordon craze could make red necks look stupid.

 &HT;    Not your typical rock and roll couple
 &HT;    By Charles Passy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JUPITER, Fla. _ You won't find a Confederate flag at Butch and
Melinda Trucks' house. Nor a Harley parked in the driveway. As for
the hard stuff, it's all stored in a wine rack in the oversized
kitchen _ and yes, it's fine wine, not cheap booze.
</P>
<P>
   But here's what you will find: a priceless collection of
antiques gathered from Boston to Burma, a wall full of
leather-bound books of great literature and philosophy, a computer
that's powerful enough to run the affairs of a small country.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and the gold records. And the paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the home of Palm Beach County's most unique artistic
couple. He's the founding drummer of the Allman Brothers Band, the
legendary Southern rock outfit that plays Coral Sky Amphitheatre
tonight. She's a gifted painter whose work has been exhibited in
South Florida, New York and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   In short, he's no redneck _ and she's no groupie. If their home
wasn't in Jupiter _ at the exclusive Admirals Cove community _
you'd swear it was in Palm Beach. Which is probably just as well,
since the society-minded Melinda, who makes a fashion statement out
of a simple black pantsuit and refuses to reveal her age, would
prefer to live on the island of the rich and famous.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where most of our friends are,'' she explains.
</P>
<P>
   The 51-year-old Butch, whose longish gray hair hints at his
good-ol'-boy past, puts the discussion back to terra firma. ``We
can't afford Palm Beach,'' he says matter-of-factly.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not, but they can afford this 4,000-square-foot
mini-estate that overlooks a golf course. They have called it home
for more than five years, having moved from another upscale
residence in nearby Palm Beach Gardens. Before that, they lived for
14 years in Tallahassee, where Butch, a Jacksonville native,
pursued a college degree at Florida State and kept up with band
business while the Tennessee-born Melinda got her master's in fine
arts. The couple also raised two kids: Seth, 22, now a
Shakespearean actor in New York, and Elise, 19, who just started
her freshman year at Smith College. (Butch also has two children
from a previous marriage.)
</P>
<P>
   They came to Palm Beach County in 1990 as a kind of compromise.
With their children's formative years behind them, Melinda wanted
to head to New York, where she could gallery-hop and pursue her art
career. Butch wanted to stay in the South because, in Melinda's
words, ``he's a Southern boy.'' He likes to fish, play golf and pal
around with friends. ``I like to get outside,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   They settled on South Florida because it offered the best of
both worlds _ a relatively cosmopolitan environment that was far
removed from Manhattan's gritty concrete sprawl. Throw in a few
fine French and Italian restaurants _ among their favorites are
Chez Jean-Pierre and Bice in Palm Beach _ and you have a life of
comfort, privilege and just plain fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``They still have the passion of younger people,'' says West
Palm Beach gallery owner Tim Eaton, a close friend of the couple's.
``She is always wanting to evolve in a sophisticated, refined way.
And Butch is wanting to expand himself in an educational way.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Melinda: ``I love it here because there are so many
cultural opportunities. And I like the people a lot much better
than the people in Tallahassee.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like them a lot much better than the people in New York,''
adds Butch, gently poking fun of Melinda's syntax. Man of
lettersand notes
</P>
<P>
   Not that there isn't work involved in this seemingly easy
existence. When Butch is not poring through those leather-bound
tomes _ ``Every book here is a book I intend to read,'' he says of
his large library _ or playing a quick 18 holes with friends, he is
still on the road a good three months of the year with the Allman
Brothers Band. Even at home, he works with his own band, a
jam-friendly ensemble called Frogwings, and plans to start a record
label (that's where the computer comes in handy).
</P>
<P>
   As for Melinda, she dines with friends and visits the Norton
Museum, but she spends most of her days in her studio a few miles
from home. It's there that she creates paintings that reflect
everything from her early academic training (Caravaggio remains a
strong influence) to a fascination with expressionism. More
recently, she's allowed her style to soften somewhat, as evidenced
by a flowing portrait of her daughter standing at a church in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to break away from the hard edge I had for 20
years,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   They are both supportive of each other's careers, even though
Butch remains the big breadwinner. A talented carpenter, he makes
most of her frames. She's done a cover for an Allman Brothers
album. The two also do their fair share of bragging. Butch loves to
walk a visitor through the house, pointing to his favorite works of
hers. Melinda calls him ``the driving force'' behind the Allman
Brothers. ``This band could not be what it was without him,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   And while the rock business and raising a family sometimes
interfered with her painting, she's made the most of the situation,
especially when it came to touring with the band.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traveling really added to my inspiration,'' she says. ``I
would take photographs everywhere we went . . . would use it as a
source for painting.'' Pair met at a '74 concert
</P>
<P>
   In a way, she's been on the road with Butch ever since she first
met him through a mutual friend at a 1974 Allman Brothers concert
in Providence, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   ``She looked like a black cloud with a girl in it,'' remembers
Butch of the girl with the incredibly long hair. For her part, she
recalls being overwhelmed by the tough, talented drummer.
Especially when Butch invited Melinda, then a would-be art teacher
in Tennessee, to come along on a European tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, all of a sudden, here I am in Tennessee one night, and
the next night I'm at a party with Rod Stewart and Mick Jagger,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   The couple was married the next year and quickly adjusted to the
rough-and-tumble pace of the rock lifestyle. The band was at the
height of its fame. Celebrities were everywhere _ vocalist/organist
Gregg Allman even married Cher. Melinda used to be mistaken for the
long-haired actress and singer, a situation Cher used to her
advantage when she needed to make a quick, quiet exit.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she was traveling with us, she used to ask me if I would
go out the front of the plane while she went out the back,''
Melinda recalls with a smile, although not all her Cher memories
are so positive. ``Cher was the most jealous woman,'' she adds.
``With every female that would walk through the door, her claws
would just come out.''
</P>
<P>
   As time wore on, it was readily apparent that the couple could
not be part of the Allman Brothers' scene in Macon, Ga., where band
members rehearsed and essentially lived with each other. Drinking
and drugs were an everyday fact. And while Butch admits to his
share of partying, the party had to end when his son Seth was born.
That's when the Trucks family moved to Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say we're the straightest couple in the whole band,
and we're the only ones who are still married,'' says Melinda.
``I've seen the wives come and go like dirty socks.'' Still
married, far from dull
</P>
<P>
   They're straight, they're still married, but they're hardly
dull. At the heart of the couple's relationship is a healthy
tension between matters serious and social, intellectual and
pedestrian. Butch is a salt-of-the-earth creature who happens to
quote Harold Bloom and names Ravel's Daphnis and Chloe as his
favorite piece of music. Melinda is something of a lady-who-lunches
_ and yet she may be one of the most brilliant unrecognized
painters in South Florida. Pick a subject, any subject, and an
argument is bound to ensue.
</P>
<P>
   Like the painter Salvador Dali, whom Melinda detests and Butch
adores.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing innovative,'' she says. ``As far as
surrealism, maybe, but he has no soul.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a helluva lot more than Andy Warhol,'' he responds
curtly, clearly pressing one of her hot buttons.
</P>
<P>
   Close friends love to witness such exchanges. ``They both agree
on many things, then fight each other in great argumentative
chorus,'' says gallery-owner Eaton. ``It's really quite educational
and liberating . . . They both grow well together.''
</P>
<P>
   About the only question that remains in the couple's 23-year
marriage is where they will grow old. Aside from her short-term
Palm Beach aspirations, Melinda is still holding out for New York.
Butch is determined to remain in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I would still love to have an apartment in New York. You
would, too, wouldn't you?'' she asks her husband teasingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have our discussion later,'' he concludes.

 &HT;    The shortest was the longest.
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS, Mo. _ The ball traveled only 341 feet, but it
transported Mark McGwire on a coveted one-way trip to baseball
immortality.
</P>
<P>
   It was the shortest home run hit by McGwire this season, but it
was the biggest of his very big life, the 62nd home run, the one
that carried him where no other baseball player has traveled.
</P>
<P>
   At 9:18 p.m. EDT, Chicago Cubs pitcher Steve Trachsel delivered
the pitch of his life, the first pitch of the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The 250-pound McGwire _ Big Mac, Man Mountain McGwire, Big Red _
flashed his 33-ounce bat with his quick uppercut swing and the
specially-marked baseball screamed toward the left-field corner,
narrowly clearing the yellow line atop the wall and the 330 sign.
</P>
<P>
   It smacked against a white Konica sign and the $10 piece of
baseball history dropped behind the outfield wall.
</P>
<P>
   Fate?
</P>
<P>
   Nobody but Mark McGwire and the Baseball Hall of Fame was going
to get this most treasured baseball of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Of his 61 previous home runs, 42 traveled more than 400 feet, 20
more than 450 feet and five more 500 feet, including one that was
sand-blasted 545 feet, the spot marked with a band-aid on a sign in
dead center field of Busch Memorial Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if McGwire said, ``This baseball belongs to nobody but
me,'' and he put it where no fan could touch it.'' Groundskeeper
Tim Forneris walked behind the wall, picked it up and delivered the
treasure to McGwire's hands.
</P>
<P>
   His home run for the ages, shredding baseball's most revered
record, one purists said might never be broken, touched off more
than 10 minutes of bedlam. Fireworks exploded over Busch Stadium,
fireworks that would have awakened the ghosts of Babe Ruth and
Roger Maris, except McGwire knows they were already watching.
</P>
<P>
   As the baseball began its short trip that will turn into a long
trip to Cooperstown, McGwire watched, then thrust his fist skyward.
He paused near first base to hug coach Dave McKay and missed first
base, quickly returning to touch it.
</P>
<P>
   How embarrassing would it have been to hit his earth-shaking
home run and be called out at first base for failing to touch it.
McKay actually grabbed McGwire and pulled him back to touch the
base, which is against the rules. But on this day? Who cares?
</P>
<P>
   As he made the grandest tour of all time around the bases, he
was greeted by each Cub _ first baseman Mark Grace, second baseman
Mickey Morandini, shortstop Jose Hernandez, third baseman Gary
Gaetti and catcher Scott Servais.
</P>
<P>
   Teammates groped him and pounded him in the grass near home
plate and McGwire broke away to lift his 10-year-old son, Matt, an
acting batboy, high into the air.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa, his pursuer for the past two months who remains
stuck at 58 home runs, ran in from right field and gave McGwire the
now-patented abdomen punch and the two embraced.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire acknowledged the howling mob several times, then ran
beyond the end of the St. Louis dugout and leaped into the seats,
stopping in front of the Roger Maris family for the most touching,
heart-tugging scene in sports history.
</P>
<P>
   It was the home run record of 61 held by Roger Maris that
McGwire broke and McGwire put his piston-like arms around the four
Maris sons and a daughter and they whispered as tears flowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to meet with them some day when this is all over
and tell them the feeling that their father was going through at
the time, because it is an amazing feeling,'' McGwire said. ``I
admire everything he has gone through because I know what he has
gone through now.''
</P>
<P>
   After hitting No. 61 Monday and before hitting No. 62 Tuesday _
his seventh home run in seven days _ McGwire said, ``It has been a
long, rough road. I go back to, I don't know, January, talking
about it into spring training and here we are. It has been quite
amazing. I think I have amazed myself. So it is hard not have
emotions for this thing. It is an unbelievable feat.''
</P>
<P>
   The 62nd came in the 145th game of the season for the Cardinals
and McGwire's 137th. When Maris hit his 61st, it was on the last
day of the season, his last at-bat, game No. 163. Then commissioner
Ford Frick insisted that an asterisk be placed next to Maris' name
because Babe Ruth hit his 60 home runs in a 154-game schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The asterisk was later removed, but the stigma stands.
</P>
<P>
   No asterisk need be discussed now. Maybe they should just put
four stars next to McGwire's name.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire is savoring and absorbing it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I will ever let go of the moment,'' he said. ``I
don't know if I will ever be here again, so how can you let it go?
What I have done is fabulous. I'm going to enjoy it right now.''
</P>
<P>
   And to think McGwire nearly tossed it all aside.
</P>
<P>
   Surgery to repair torn planter fascia tissue in his left heel in
1993 gave him back problems and a stress fracture in the same heel
in 1994. More planter fascia tissue problems surfaced in spring
training in 1995 and McGwire said, ``I considered quitting for a
day or two. I was very, very depressed. My friends and parents
talked me out of it and then I let my mind talk me out of it, thank
God.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really funny that an injury turned my career around,'' he
said. ``But I always knew in the back of my mind these things were
happening to me for a reason. When I was injured, it was the first
time I really started studying the pitchers, studying the hitters.
. .and studying myself.''
</P>
<P>
   And now Mark McGwire is a study unto himself.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A on the news
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: The latest unrest in Russia makes me wonder: Whatever
happened to the body of Communist leader Vladimir Lenin? Can the
public still view it, or has it been removed and buried?
</P>
<P>
   A: Lenin's preserved corpse, waxy faced and clad in a suit,
remains on display in a glass tomb in a shrine in Red Square in
Moscow, where it has been viewed by millions of people. But it may
not be there forever. Russian President Boris Yeltsin has called
for a nationwide vote on the issue of whether to leave the embalmed
corpse where it has been enshrined for decades, or to bury it.
Yeltsin has said he favors burying Lenin, father of the Bolshevik
revolution, but he wants the country to decide. Lenin died in 1924.
The Central Lenin Museum in Red Square, by the way, simply closed
down after the August 1991 coup, ``pending reconstruction.'' It
remains closed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the academic and other qualifications to become a
White House intern? Why was Monica Lewinsky hired?
</P>
<P>
   A: White House interns, most of whom are 18 to 23, must have a
strong academic background, a demonstrated interest in government
and politics, and be willing to work long hours. The program is
officially nonpartisan, and therefore presumably open equally to
young Democrats and young Republicans. Applicants submit a college
transcript, resume, essay and two letters of recommendation. Those
admitted undergo drug tests; FBI background checks; screening by
the president's security team and briefings by the FBI, Secret
Service and Metropolitan D.C. police, all of which are designed to
stress the importance of good behavior.
</P>
<P>
   It also helps to have political connections, as White House
press secretary Mike McCurry was quoted a saying in January: ``Many
of them are sons and daughters of supporters. It's not uncommon
that people have connections.'' Lewinsky was hired on the
recommendation of Walter Kaye, a family friend and big contributor
to the Democratic Party. Kaye is a wealthy retired insurance
executive who knew Lewinsky's mother, Marcia Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When we're told by local authorities to boil water from the
tap because it may be contaminated, how long should it boil? After
it has cooled to room temperature, should it be refrigerated? And
after that, how long can it be used for drinking?
</P>
<P>
   A: To be absolutely safe, boil water that may be contaminated
for 10 minutes. The boiled water can be stored indefinitely in
clean containers at room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several years ago, Ted Turner offered a prize for the best
novel set in the future. Was a winner ever announced? Did it sell
well?
</P>
<P>
   A: Daniel Quinn's ``Ishmael'' was declared winner of the
$500,000 Turner Tomorrow Award in June 1991. It was published in
January 1992 in hardback and reissued in 1995 in paperback. The
novel is a series of conversations between a man and a great ape
(named Ishmael) about the state of the world and what can be done
to save it. Simply put, Ishmael's message is that Earth does not
belong to man, but that man belongs to the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn was thrust abruptly into the spotlight when his novel was
selected from more than 2,500 manuscripts in a worldwide
competition, sponsored by Turner, to encourage works of fiction
with creative and positive solutions to global problems. After
publication, ``Ishmael'' languished until Oprah Winfrey announced
that the book had changed her life, and Quinn appeared on her TV
program. Sales soared, and Bantam went back to press with the book
another five times.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What can you tell us about Mark McGwire's early years?
</P>
<P>
   A: McGwire was born Oct. 1, 1963, in Pomona, Calif. A baseball
fan as a boy, Mark David McGwire began playing Little League at 8.
According to the story, in his first at-bat, he hit a home run over
the right-field fence off a 12-year-old pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, he graduated from Damien High School in Claremont,
Calif., where he had developed into a power pitcher. The Montreal
Expos drafted him, but he didn't like Montreal's offer and decided
to go to the University of Southern California, where he gave up
pitching to concentrate on becoming a hitter. In 1984 he hit 32
homers, a USC record. Later that year he played on the U.S. Olympic
baseball team and was drafted by the Oakland Athletics as a
first-round (10th overall) free-agent pick.
</P>
<P>
   He left USC to join the A's minor league system, where he spent
about two years. He was called up to the Major League team near the
end of the 1986 season and played for the A's until signing with
the St. Louis Cardinals late in the 1997 season.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the largest bill in circulation in the United States?
</P>
<P>
   A: A $10,000 Federal Reserve note is the largest U.S. bill, but
the government began withdrawing it and several other large U.S.
bills ($500, $1,000 and $5,000) from circulation in 1969. The $100
note is the largest bill currently being printed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where were the D-Day invasion scenes in ``Saving Private
Ryan'' filmed? Also, surely there are no bombed-out villages left
in Europe from World War II, so where were the location scenes
made?
</P>
<P>
   A: The scenes depicting the invasion of Omaha Beach were shot in
Ireland. Tom Sanders, the movie's production designer, said he
searched all around France, Ireland and England before choosing the
Irish coast. The harbor, the Irish sea, the Irish weather and a
beach that was big enough _ even with the tide out _ all
contributed to the realism the filmmakers sought.
</P>
<P>
   The French village was re-created at an abandoned British
aerospace facility, Hatfield Aerodrome, in Hertfordshire north of
London. It started as a grass field, but when cameras started to
roll it had a full-scale, historically accurate reproduction of a
bombed-out French village and a bridge spanning a river where the
story reaches its climax for Capt. John Miller (Tom Hanks) and his
men. Thame Park in Oxfordshire, England, provided the setting for
several scenes, including an intense skirmish between Miller's
squad and a German machine-gun nest.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I think Lynne Russell of CNN Headline News is the most
beautiful woman on television. What is her background?
</P>
<P>
   A: For more than a decade, Russell has been the prime-time
weekday evening anchor on Headline News, CNN's sister service.
Before that, she spent six years as co-host with Bob Cain on CNN's
``The Week in Review.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell attended the University of Colorado, where she majored
in nursing. From 1971 to 1978, she was program director, as well as
anchor and host, of a news and interview program at WKAT, a Miami
talk radio station. In 1978 and '79, she anchored and reported at
WTLV-TV in Jacksonville, Fla. After a year as a news anchor and
military correspondent for KHON-TV in Honolulu, she joined KENS-TV
in San Antonio as an evening news anchor and investigative and
courthouse reporter. In 1983, she moved to CNN.
</P>
<P>
   She's a licensed private investigator who works part-time as a
detective. She's a first-degree black belt in Choi Kwang-Do; a
bodyguard to visiting celebrities; and a Fulton County deputy
sheriff in the reserve division. She also is certified as an
open-water scuba diver.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read about a survivalist suspected of murdering two campers
in the North Carolina woods. He then disappeared, supposedly to
prove he could survive in the wild as well as bombing suspect Eric
Robert Rudolph. Was he ever caught?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. The suspect, James Andrew Finley Jr., was captured Aug.
5. Finley, 21, of Hickory, N.C., was charged in the slaying of
Andrew Marston and Tommi Danielle Byrd, both 24, a Charlotte couple
found shot and slashed to death Aug. 2 in the Linville Gorge
Wilderness Area.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Finley's acquaintances had described him as an admirer
of Rudolph, the North Carolina man who has eluded an intensive
manhunt in the Nantahala National Forest since being accused of the
Jan. 29 bombing of a Birmingham abortion clinic. The acquaintances,
according to authorities, said Finley, an experienced outdoorsman,
bragged that he, too, could escape capture.
</P>
<P>
   Finley remains held without bond in Morganton, N.C., said Capt.
Pat Messick of the Burke County Sheriff's Department. Officers will
seek a grand jury indictment on the federal level Sept. 15, he
added, noting that the murders occurred on federal property.
</P>
<P>
   Q: One day, when I checked after the stock market had been open
for 40 minutes, a particular stock I was interested in still was
not open. Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: Such a delayed opening isn't uncommon. Myron Greene,
publisher of the Mutual Fund Timing Guide and business professor
emeritus at Georgia State University, said it happens mainly when
there's an imbalance between the number of buy orders and sell
orders, and often results from an unexpected announcement by a
company _ for example, when it's reporting unexpectedly good
earnings. Such an announcement might spark an influx of orders to
buy when there aren't enough matching orders to sell, so to prevent
a disruption in the trading of that stock, its opening is delayed
or, if the stock already has opened, trading is suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There are signs in hospitals warning against using cell
phones. Why is that?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's possible for cellular phones to interfere with equipment
such as ventilators and balloon and fusion pumps, as well as
telemetry. Cell phones could cause erratic signals or alarms in the
machines, possibly making a ventilator deliver an extra breath,
say. So in the interest of patient care, their use is forbidden.
The use of cell phones also is prohibited on board aircraft, by the
way, for a similar reason: possible interference with navigational
equipment and electrical systems.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the name of the firm Dow Jones &AMP; Co., I know about Charles
Dow. But who was Jones?
</P>
<P>
   A: Edward T. Jones was one of the founders of the company in
1882, along with Dow and a third person whose name would have
complicated things a bit: Charles Bergstresser.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A on the news

 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED: Q: In the name of the firm Dow Jones &AMP; Co., I know
about Charles Dow. But who was Jones?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has Bill Gates of Microsoft made any public comments about
the Y2K problem?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, but if you're hoping Gates could offer a quick fix,
you'll be disappointed. In a question and answer column Gates wrote
about Y2K, he began by stating what is well known: ``The Year 2000
problem is caused by the use in software of two-digit dates, such
as 01, to stand for years. When we go from 1999 to 2000, two-digit
dates become ambiguous. . . . Mainframes are the most severely
affected, in part because two-digit usage was common in older
systems where memory was limited due to high costs. Because the
problem could lurk anywhere in very complex code, the hardest part
about a solution is finding all the places where it occurs.''
</P>
<P>
   His assessment, shared by many others: ``There will be a
headache, but how much pain it will cause remains to be seen . . .
but companies all over the world are working hard to prevent it.''
In other words, there's no magic wand.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where did Andres Galarraga, the Atlanta Braves' first
baseman, get the nickname ``Big Cat''?
</P>
<P>
   A: Galarrage is huge (6-foot-3, weighing nearly 250 pounds), yet
he runs well and is unusually graceful, especially on defense.
That's how he got his nickname.
</P>
<P>
   Q: All the attention about the Titanic reminds me of the Edmund
Fitzgerald. I recall that divers were supposed to go down to its
wreckage to try and determine what caused it to sink, but I never
heard their findings. Do you have any details?
</P>
<P>
   A: The only extensive manned expedition to the ship's wreckage
on the floor of Lake Superior took place in July 1994, when
scentists and marine historians on a miniature submarine undertook
a three-day mission to probe the mystery of the Fitzgerald's
sinking on Nov. 10, 1975. Despite intensive searching, no actual
cause was discovered. The two most common theories are that the
ship took on water as 30-foot seas crashed over its side, and
finally nose-dived under a monster wave; and that it hit a poorly
charted shoal, tearing a gash in the hull. In his report on the
dive, Canadian marine scientist Joe MacInnis was quoted as saying:
``We still can't say why the ship went down. The crew had no idea
what happened, it was so sudden, so explosive.'' All 29 crew
members aboard the Fitzgerald were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I don't recall ever reading the exact injuries that caused
Princess Diana's death. Was that information made public?
</P>
<P>
   A: The princess of Wales suffered severe head and chest
injuries. Death was attributed to cardiac arrest resulting from
laceration of the left pulmonary vein (a vessel that transports
oxygenated blood from the lungs). Doctors at Hospital La Pitie
Salpetriere in Paris performed surgery to close the wound and tried
to revive her with chest massage, first externally and then
directly to the heart, but after two hours she was declared dead.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you compare the size, tonnage displacement and passenger
capacity of the Titanic, the first Queen Elizabeth and the Queen
Mary?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 46,328-ton Titanic measured 882 feet, 8 inches long and
92 feet wide, and had a capacity of 2,435 passengers. The
82,997-ton Queen Elizabeth was 1,031 feet long and 118 feet wide
and had a capacity of 2,197 passengers. The 81,237-ton Queen Mary
was 1,019 feet, 6 inches long and 118 feet wide, with a capacity of
1,948 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently reported on prisons used by the Union and the
Confederacy for troops captured in the Civil War. Is there a good
resource book with more information?
</P>
<P>
   A: A number of books dealing with the Civil War have information
about prisons. A good resource is the 1,056-page Historical Times
Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Civil War (Patricia L. Faust,
editor; HarperPerennial). It should be available in libraries or
bookstores, and can be ordered by bookstores using ISBN number
0-06-181261-7. The hardcover was published first in 1986 by Harper
&AMP; Row; the HarperPerennial edition in 1991. It remains in print.
</P>
<P>
   Another recommended book is ``Portals to Hell: Military Prisons
of the Civil War'' (by Lonnie R. Speer; Stackpole Books). Its ISBN
number: 0811703347.
</P>
<P>
   Q: One of the criteria for subjects featured on U.S. postage
stamps is that the subject should be American-related. But an
article about stamps to be chosen as representative of the '70s
showed an image of a KLM airplane as a nominee for a stamp in the
science and technology category. KLM is the Dutch national airline,
so why would it be chosen over a U.S. airline that flies jumbo
jets?
</P>
<P>
   A: The KLM image was intended only to illustrate a jumbo jet,
which is in the science and technology category of nominated
stamps, but the Postal Service has no plans to use it for a stamp
design, said Don Smeraldi of the Postal Service. Since public
voting is still going on for the ``Celebrate the Century'' stamp
program, no designs have been chosen yet, nor will they for ``for a
while,'' Smeraldi added. The issuance of the stamps celebrating the
1970s is expected in September 1999. Post offices are distributing

   An official ballot is part of the brochure. Those with online
capability can vote at this address: http://stampvote.msn.com Q: I
thought measures had been put into place to stop trading on the
stock market when prices began to fall sharply. Why weren't they on
Aug. 31, the day of the 512-point drop?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're talking about the so-called ``circuit breakers'' put
into effect by the New York Stock Exchange after the stock market
crash in 1987, said Myron Greene, publisher of the Mutual Fund
Timing Guide and business professor emeritus at Georgia State
University. The initial version in 1987 was two-pronged. The first
would have halted trading for 30 minutes if the Dow Jones
Industrial Average fell 350 points; the second for an hour if it
fell 550 points.
</P>
<P>
   But because the Dow gained so much ground in recent times, the
circuit breakers were changed earlier this year from points to
percentages, Greene said. Now, if the Dow were to fall 10 percent,
trading would be suspended for an hour; 20 percent, two hours; 30
percent, the remainder of the day. So to trigger the first tier of
the present circuit breakers, the Dow would need to have fallen
around 800 points Aug. 31; it fell about 512 points, well short of
the level required.
</P>
<P>
   These circuit breakers don't stop prices from falling, as Greene
pointed out; they just suspend trading. ``The idea is to give
investors time to stop and reflect, and sort of eliminate the mood
of hysteria,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know what NASDAQ is, but what do the initials stand for?
</P>
<P>
   A: National Association of Securities Dealers Automated
Quotations.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is an Alford plea?
</P>
<P>
   A: The name is derived from a 1970 Supreme Court case, North
Carolina v. Alford. According to Black's Law Dictionary, the court
held that ``a guilty plea which represented a voluntary and
intelligent choice among alternatives available to the defendant,
especially where he was represented by competent counsel, was not
compelled within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment merely because
the plea was entered to avoid the possibility of the death
penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   An Alford guilty plea is described more simply as a legal
mechanism that allows defendants to plead guilty if they think it
is in their best interest, even if they believe they are innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What happened to the storm between Bonnie and Danielle?
Shouldn't there have been one with a name starting with C?
</P>
<P>
   A: There was such a tropical storm, said Frank Lepore of the
National Hurricane Center in Miami. You just didn't hear the name.
Charley struck the Texas Gulf coast, dropping large amounts of
rain, then dissipated rapidly. The first hurricane of the season
was Alex, which dissipated into a few puffs of wind off the Leeward
Islands in early August.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does the U.S. Postal Service have any plans for using only
ZIP codes after a person's name for the address of domestic mail?
</P>
<P>
   A: Using only a person's or company's name and even a nine-digit
ZIP code wouldn't be sufficient because the code doesn't pinpoint a
specific place, said Sandra Harding of the Postal Service in
Washington. An 11-digit code is more specific, but it's imbedded in
a bar code, and that could fall off an envelope. A ZIP code
supplements the full written street name and house or building
number, Harding said. As a backup, the written address also would
allow the Postal Service to deliver the mail properly if its
automated equipment went down because of a power failure, flood or
other problem, and it allows proper forwarding if someone moves.
ZIP codes alone wouldn't do that.

 &HT;    Courtney proves she doesn't need Cobain or Corgan
 &HT;    By Michael Corcoran
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Courtney Love is not doing many interviews to promote
her band Hole's third album ``Celebrity Skin,'' which hit the
stores this week. But the 33-year-old queen of the new cultural
holocaust doesn't really need to sit for questions, as many of the
pertinent answers can be found in the lyrics of her first album
recorded since the heroin-coaxed suicide of reluctant rock star
husband Kurt Cobain.
</P>
<P>
   Why the Hollywood makeover?
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on be alive again/ Don't lay down and die/ You know what
to do/ Baby, drive away to Malibu'' (from ``Malibu'').
</P>
<P>
   Does fame and fortune come with a price?
</P>
<P>
   ``You better watch out what you wish for/ It better be worth it,
so much to die for'' (from ``Celebrity Skin'').
</P>
<P>
   How's Kurt's musical legacy with Nirvana holding up?
</P>
<P>
   ``They bought and sold it all, it's gone/ They've taken it and
built a mall/ And now they're playing your song'' (from ``Playing
Your Song'').
</P>
<P>
   The ``girl with the most cake'' who screamed that ``there is no
power like ugly, ugly, ugly'' on the title track to Hole's '91
debut ``Pretty on the Inside,'' has done a million belly crunches
since we first heard from her. She's also had some plastic surgery,
the first of which (a nose job) Love justified in an old interview
as a way to validate her anger. She said she didn't want to be
considered one of those unattractive female rockers _ ``They're
fat, they're ugly, no wonder they're screaming,'' she mocked _ and
the only way to do that was to make herself beautiful. But even as
the former low-rent junkie stripper has modeled for Versace and was
good enough in ``The People vs. Larry Flynt'' to be snubbed by the
Oscars, Love is still ``praying to the wound that swallows,''
trying to pull herself out of the emotional abyss (and overwrought
arrangement) of the new album's ``Northern Star.''
</P>
<P>
   The class contradictorian, this tender vulgarian bares her soul
then tells you it's none of your damned business. In concert, Love
flashes her panties when she puts her foot on the monitor, then
wants to know what you're staring at.
</P>
<P>
   Through a series of scandalous incidents, including an admission
in an infamous '92 interview with Vanity Fair's Lynn Hirshberg that
she injected heroin while pregnant with daughter Frances, Love has
often come off like the world is a one-way mirror with a camera to
record her every move. She winks defiant, however, as she shoplifts
the garment of propriety down the front of her ``kinderwhore''
dress. ``I was punk!/ Now I'm just stupid/ I'm so awful'' she sings
on ``Awful,'' a brilliant new power pop song that's anything but.
</P>
<P>
   If Hole's previous LP ``Live Through This,'' which was released
five days after Cobain's self-inflicted martyrdom in April '94,
came off like a 911 call to the media, ``Celebrity Skin'' is the
accused letting the world know she can make creative bail. Vocally,
Love's affected drone is a taste not easily acquired, like radish
ravioli, but there's no mistaking a songwriting gift that combines
remarkable melodic instincts with an unflinching punk swagger. The
cover photo, which looks to be an homage to X's ``Los Angeles''
album, shows Love and her band mates in frozen toughness while a
palm tree burns behind them. The music inside mirrors the rock star
stare-down with big fat guitar riffs and three-alarm sentiments
that shoot up from the orchestrated confusion. The lyrics are
merely the mist in this jungle of sound and, after hitting
``play,'' only one question matters: Doth it rock? Yeth, it does.
</P>
<P>
   It's not quite as consistently powerful and intriguing as ``Live
Through This,'' but ``Celebrity Skin'' contains enough great pop
rockers _ ``Awful,'' ``Boys on the Radio,'' ``Reasons To Be
Beautiful,'' ``Playing Your Song'' (none of which were co-written
by credit glutton Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins) _ that
Love can finally be known more for her body of work than for the
lifeless body of the husband who reportedly pulled the strings last
time out. The ``Kurtney'' tag can be laid to rest, even as Love
spins off from Cobain's suicide note when she sings, ``It's better
to rise than fade away'' on ``Reasons To Be Beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Corgan, who has claimed to be the Svengali behind
``Celebrity Skin,'' yet has collaborative credits on only five of
the LP's 12 tracks, he's merely reinforced his reputation as a
hollow glory hound, the guy Cobain used to call ``the pear-shaped
box.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, or maybe not so, Love was visiting her
then-boyfriend and Caroline Records label mate Corgan in Chicago in
October '91 when she and Cobain became soulmates with the swiftness
of a gut punch. Nirvana had just capped an amazing, riveting,
overpowering set at the Cabaret Metro with a version of ``Smells
Like Teen Spirit'' that threatened to tear down the club's walls
from the sheer impact of the moment. But instead of praising the
band backstage, Love walked up to Cobain and slugged him in the
stomach. He doubled over, then sprung up to tackle the woman he'd
met a couple years earlier in Portland. As they tumbled to the
ground together and Nirvana's handlers moved in to separate the
star from the psychopath, Kurt and Courtney burst out laughing and
rolled around on each other. Cobain, who was uneasy with the
adulation heaped on his songs of disenfranchisement, had met his
match with the flame-haired motormouth who challenged him even as
she was clearly in awe. She became Nancy to his Sid, the enabler
whose main responsibility was to shake him back to life when it was
time to get more.
</P>
<P>
   If it was fame, mixed with feelings of inadequacy that killed
Cobain (an overtly sensitive mope who never really got over his
parents' divorce when he was a child), Love has slept with the
enemy. Where Cobain despised the idea of celebrity, it's been
Love's driving force since she was a teen-age rock 'n' roll skank
who cut herself with broken bottles onstage to get attention.
</P>
<P>
   She craves the trappings in much the way that her platinum
predecessor does. But where Madonna was made for the disco overflow
of the '80s, with her embracement of gay culture providing most of
the ``danger'' points, Love is the queen of '90s apocalypso music.
``Celebrity Skin'' is music to listen to while the palm trees burn.
Paradise is what you make of it, and Courtney Love is clearly
someone who prefers the glare of an inferno to the warmth of the
sun.

 &HT;    GM promises to keep open plant, but will eliminate jobs
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The diesel engine plant to be built by General Motors Corp. and
Isuzu Motors Ltd. in Moraine will be one of the largest joint
ventures ever between a Japanese and United States automaker.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, workers at a GM parts plant in Kettering recently
received details of a tentative agreement that would prevent GM
from selling or closing the troubled plant for four years. But the
agreement also calls for the elimination of 400 jobs, mostly
through attrition.
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for the $300 million diesel engine plant in Moraine
to employ 700 workers and produce more than 100,000 engines
annually starting in 2000, the automakers said.
</P>
<P>
   The 6.6 liter, direct injection diesel engines produced at the
plant will be used in GM's new pick-up trucks and some full-size
sport utility vehicles, GM officials said. Jack Smith, GM's
chairman and chief executive, and Isuzu Chairman Kazuhira Seki,
will unveil more details about the new plant today at a ceremony in
Moraine.
</P>
<P>
   Isuzu, recognized as the world's leader in designing and
manufacturing diesel engines, will have a 60 percent controlling
interest in the joint venture called DMAX Ltd. The name is meant to
signify the diesel engine and maximum power. GM will control the
other 40 percent in the new company, but Isuzu is responsible for
production and engineering of the engine.
</P>
<P>
   About 90 percent of the locally produced diesel engines will be
shipped to U.S. assembly plants, while the other 10 percent will be
exported to Canada, GM officials said.
</P>
<P>
   GM and Isuzu are betting that a new generation of diesel engines
- not the smoky, noisy contraptions of the past - will power the
environmentally friendly ``green'' car of the near future.
</P>
<P>
   But changing environmental regulations and competing
technologies could make the diesel plant a risky investment in a
volatile market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diesels and the investments being funneled into them could
shrink very quickly,'' said Joe Phillippi of Lehman Bros. in New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the automakers say the new plant would have been
constructed elsewhere if not for an agreement between the
automakers and the International Union of Electronic Workers, which
will represent workers at the new factory.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, hourly workers at the existing Moraine Engine
plant approved a three-tier wage scale for hourly employees that
will pay new workers $8.93 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at our work force, we have thousands of years
experience to apply to this new engine,'' said Ed Fire, president
of the International IUE.
</P>
<P>
   The new plant will be located between Ohio 741 and Dryden Road
near GM's Moraine truck assembly and engine plants. The existing
diesel engine plant in Moraine employs about 500 workers and is
expected to be closed next year. About 300 of those workers will be
transferred to the new plant, while the other 200 are eligible for
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   GM has had a stake in Isuzu since 1971 and makes small pickups
for the Japanese company in the United States. Isuzu has 13,000
employees worldwide and is Japan's largest truck maker.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1984, GM and another Japanese automaker, Toyota, have
operated a 50-50 joint venture called the New United Motor
Manufacturing Inc. in Fremont, Calif., which employs 4,700 United
Auto Workers. The massive plant, located 20 miles south of Oakland,
Calif., makes the Chevy Prizm for GM and the Tacoma pickup truck
and Corolla for Toyota.
</P>
<P>
   The NUMMI joint venture resurrected nearly 5,000 UAW jobs when
it started making vehicles for GM and Toyota.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't any resistance from the UAW in working with
Toyota when it opened and both partners have shown a strong
interest in continuing their relationship for years to come,'' said
Michael Damer, spokesman for NUMMI.
</P>
<P>
   The Kettering plant workers will receive more details of an
agreement that could determine the future of the factory that
employs 2,700 hourly workers. The plant makes shocks and struts for
GM and other automakers.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the plant said the agreement will offer the
workers job security for the next four years, but will reduce the
plant's employment level by 400 jobs. The pact also places a cap on
part of the plant's three-tier wage scale, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kettering plant has been targeted for sale or shutdown for
more than two years due to financial losses. The plant has lost $50
million over the past two years.

 &HT;    St. Ed's puts leash on taking dogs to work
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It looks like we won't have to worry about dogs
getting up on the endowed furniture over at St. Edward's University
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a new policy, staff and faculty will no longer be
allowed to bring dogs to class or the office at the South Austin
school.
</P>
<P>
   This no-dogs-at-the-office rule doesn't exactly please Emma Lou
Linn, a St. Ed's psychology professor who says she'll have to get
rid of her little dog if the policy is enforced.
</P>
<P>
   Linn said she had been taking Joan, a Norwich terrier, to the
office for two years because she's at work 12 hours a day and she
lives downtown in a third-floor apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Linn even has a little replica (see photo) of Joan, a
half-sister of Champion Fairewood Frolic, best of show this year at
the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, but can the rugratchase cars?
</P>
<P>
   ``I adopted her off the Internet,'' said Linn, a former City
Council member (1975-77). ``With these little dogs, you have to
sign a pledge that they're treated like a member of the family. You
take them with you and don't leave them for hours alone. If you
can't treat them like that, you have to put them up for rehoming.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, unlike the Dallas Cowboys, whom St. Ed's also ran off,
Linn's dog has never been accused of going tee-tee in a dorm hall.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine MacDermott doesn't like the new rule, either. For four
years, the St. Ed's business communications teacher had been
bringing her dog Miss Whippet, or Missy, to the office.
</P>
<P>
   But because of the new rule, Missy is now going to work with
MacDermott's husband, David, a graphic designer.
</P>
<P>
   The dog probably would have preferred it if David had a job on a
garbage truck. Either way, Catherine sees the dog's relocation as a
loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``The students love her; it's a sad situation,'' she said,
adding that she also took the dog to class a couple of times
without incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's extremely well-behaved. I'd take a little rug with me,
and she'd just sit on the rug.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Funk, St. Ed's interim president, said he came up with
the new rule to be fair to the students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not permit students to have animals _ dogs or cats _ in
residence halls,'' he said. ``It's very difficult to explain to
students why faculty or staff members can have animals in academic
buildings or in the administration building.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Funk added, you don't usually see animals in college
anyway. ``In the context of higher education, most colleges and
universities do not permit animals in buildings,'' Funk said.
</P>
<P>
   That's funny. When I was in college we had animals in buildings.
I know, because I sat next to a couple of football players in art
appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   Also inconvenienced by this new rule is Rudy, a Japanese Chin.
Rudy, you see, had been going to the office at St. Ed's with Chris
Williams for the past year and a half.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was disappointing,'' said Williams, the school's director
of records and research. ``He was a delightful addition to the
office, and there were several people in my department who were
disappointed when he wasn't allowed to be here anymore. He was
always there when we had our meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course the dog was a welcome addition at meetings. What a
great way to get out of a meeting: ``I'm leaving early 'cause I've
got to walk the dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Shoot, I'd take a rat to work if I thought it would get me out
of a meeting.

 &HT;    Lisa Petersen lives out every woman's fantasy
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   No, that would not be an all-expenses-paid Cruise, of either the
Tom or the Caribbean variety.
</P>
<P>
   She is a queen, and not just Queen for a Day. Nay, she has that
television chestnut beat by a royal mile. Petersen is queen for
eight weekends, with option to renew. And she is no less a monarch
than Elizabeth I, reigning over this year's Ohio Renaissance
Festival through Oct. 18.
</P>
<P>
   By day, Petersen is administrative secretary in the genteel
realm of the Dayton Woman's Club. By weekend, she is the touch of
gentility in the bawdy world of 16th century England.
</P>
<P>
   It has to be the best job in town. Sure, there are drawbacks.
Lugging around 2 tons of brocade in 80-degree heat is ``like
wearing a couch,'' Petersen concedes. She must endure a bridal
spotlight during festival hours _ no joking around with the livery
boy, mind you. And no matter how liberally she applies Mary Kay 30
sunscreen (in pure ivory shade, naturally) she'll be ``burnt as a
berry'' by season's end.
</P>
<P>
   Petersen, 27, a native of New Jersey, studied theater at Wright
State University. She has immersed herself in the role, even to the
extent of dyeing her hair a reddish auburn and thinking in
Elizabethan. Playing queen satisfies her yen for acting with a
combination of improvisation and scripted events _ opening and
closing ceremonies, the Queen's feast, royal jousts and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   And who wouldn't love the adoration of the children who practice
off-balance curtsies and bring her flowers and homemade jewelry?
</P>
<P>
   Petersen handles the children with exactly the right blend of
gentleness and authority. Her voice assumes a kindly-yet-regal lilt
during the knighting/princessing ceremonies, a daily ritual in
which children stand in long lines to be named lords and ladies of
the realm.
</P>
<P>
   A 5-year-old named Elizabeth approaches the throne, in her eyes
filled with awe and wonderment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elizabeth! What a wondrous name!'' the queen exclaims. Raising
her golden scepter she intones, ``In the name of St. Michael and of
St. George, and of God above, I announce thee a princess of our
court. Rise, Lady Elizabeth, go forth and serve us well.''
</P>
<P>
   The small knight or princess scampers off, sometimes with a
little prompting from the sovereign. ``Rise, Sir Thomas,'' she
tells one toddler. ``That means get up,'' she whispers. ``You're
really a knight now; you can go,'' she encourages another boy.
``Huzzah!''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they believe,'' Petersen says, ``it's my responsibility not
to mess up the moment and to make it important for them. At the
same time, I try to keep it light and inject humor, so they aren't
afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   This is her first year as queen after six years of playing the
wife of the Lord Mayor, ``my ditzy alter ego.'' Her real character
is ``somewhere in the middle,'' she says. ``I don't have much
problem dragging that royal air out of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Longtime Queen Laura Hunt Yungblut, the Virgin Queen from 1992
to 1996, concurs that ``the biggest rewards came through the kids''
and friendships with fellow cast members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since my research is Elizabethan England, to be able to play
Elizabeth Tudor was a kick,'' says Yungblut, an assistant professor
of history at the University of Dayton, specializing in medieval
and early modern English history.
</P>
<P>
   Yungblut even takes her show on the road, introducing Elizabeth
I to grade school and high school students. She said she thinks
young people ought to learn about this fascinating and in many ways
admirable woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire her ability to govern as more than a female
figurehead in an incredibly male-dominated society,'' Yungblut
says. ``Instead of regarding gender as a weakness, she played on
the stereotypes expected of her gender and treated them as
strengths. She played suitors off against each other, playing the
indecisive female, to great diplomatic advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   The role of the great monarch ``feeds my need to act and feeds
my spirit,'' Petersen says. ``It's like theater in the round; your
audience is everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Staying true to the period is the greatest challenge when
interacting with patrons. Last year, after the death of Princess
Diana, many people expressed their regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not a princess by that name at this time,'' the actors
responded, ``but we offer condolences over the loss of this
ruler.'' Or, if someone refers to the Spanish Armada, Petersen
offers this: ``We hear Spain is amassing an armada, but we have no
fear at this time.''

 &HT;    Minority enrollment growing in suburbs
 &HT;    By A. Phillips Brooks
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Minority students increasingly have moved from
big-city schools to suburban campuses in the past decade, according
to a report released recently by the Texas Education Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The trend took some state officials by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really caught our eye,'' said Debbie Graves Ratcliffe, a
spokeswoman for the agency. ``I think it may b e that more
minorities are entering the middle class and following the middle
class to the suburbs.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also found that Central Texas schools are growing
faster than others in the state. Enrollment in public schools in
Region 13, which includes Travis, Williamson, Hays and Bastrop
counties, increased 37 percent from 1987-88 to 1997-98, the agency
found.
</P>
<P>
   The report noted that African American, Hispanic and Asian
students made up 55 percent of Texas' 3.9 million schoolchildren in
the 1997-98 school year, compared with 45 percent of white
students.
</P>
<P>
   Central Texas school officials _ who are grappling with rapid
growth and demographic shifts _ say they are not surprised by those
trends, which they say are fueled by minority parents' desire for
better schools, safer communities and affordable homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our minority parents want the same thing Anglo parents do,''
said Robert Spoonemore, superintendent of the Pflugerville
Independent School District. ``They want a home that meets the
American dream and good schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, the German settlement north of Austin was
virtually all-white. The district had two elementary schools, one
junior high and a high school.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the district is on the verge of being a ``majority
minority'' district in which blacks, Hispanics and Asians combined
will be a majority of the enrollment. The district now has 16
schools, including two high schools. Two more schools are in the
works.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a total shock to some people, but we may be a majority
minority this fall when the numbers are in,'' Spoonemore said.
</P>
<P>
   Rapid growth has stressed school resources and the district's
budget. Nearly a third of school taxes are financing new schools.
Spoonemore said the district has set up a bilingual program for its
Spanish-speaking students. Pflugerville, he said, needs a similar
bilingual program for its Vietnamese-speaking students but has not
yet found a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Leander schools also are feeling growing pains from rapid
growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll break ground in the next two to three weeks for a new
elementary school,'' said Bill Britcher, a spokesman for the
Leander district, whose student population increased by about 60
percent in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   One month later, the district will begin building a new middle
school, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Britcher said good schools and undeveloped lots that sell for
prices hard to find in Austin are the reasons for rapid growth.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic students, once too small a percentage of the student
body to meet the threshold required by the state for tracking and
testing purposes, make up more than 12 percent of Leander's
enrollment this fall, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Round Rock, a booming high-tech industry has lured residents
from California and other states, said Mike Jolly, interim
superintendent for the Round Rock Independent School District.
Growth has been mostly in white students, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The education agency report also found:
</P>
<P>
   Economically disadvantaged students made up the fastest-growing
segment of Texas students, increasing 65 percent. Economically
disadvantaged students also made up a majority in two-thirds of all
urban school districts in 1997-98, up from 47 percent a decade
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   African American students were the most likely to move to the
suburbs. Ten years ago, 42 percent of black students attended urban
schools and 18 percent attended suburban schools. Today, 35 percent
of African American students attend urban schools, while 28 percent
attend suburban schools.

``Celebrity Skin'' is music to listen to while the palm trees burn.

   COSTELLO-REVIEW _ Stand-up comic Sue Costello is a lot like her
brash, in-your-face sitcom. The south Boston native is loud, tacky

fact, Costello gets the award for the season's tackiest _ and

   EVERGLADE-BUDGET _ After years of doling out hundreds of

EVEN PRIVATELY OWNED FORESTS NEED FEDERAL OVERSIGHT

<TEXT>
<P>
   Two-thirds of America's forest lands are owned by local, state
or private entities. Recently, the well-respected National Research
Council released a report calling for a national policy to help
maintain these important non-federal forest lands. The report hit
the hot button for Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, and he has called for
its total rejection.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, Young is overreacting to this thrust for forest
conservation. He receives a large chunk of his campaign
contributions from the timber industry.
</P>
<P>
   The National Research Council is an independent body that was
organized by the National Academy of Sciences back in 1916 _ during
World War I _ to promote the national security and welfare of the
nation using scientific and technological expertise. The council is
administered by the National Academy of Sciences, the National
Academy of Engineering and the Institute of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 council report, ``Forested Landscapes in Perspective:
Prospects and Opportunities for Sustainable Management of America's
Nonfederal Forests'' took two years to research and write and makes
a number of recommendations to ensure the long-term health of these
forest lands.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the recommendations encroach upon private ownership _
causing Young to see red. He sent letters to 300 timber industry
executives alerting them to the report, and included his staff's
unfavorable analysis of it.
</P>
<P>
   Young's Aug. 11 letter overstates the report's conclusions:
``Basically, their (the report's authors) argument is that in the
name of `public interest' the federal government can do with your
private land as it pleases.'' Young uses his letter to urge timber
companies to politically support greater logging on federal lands.
</P>
<P>
   He's lobbying the timber industrys' lobbyists to support him in
his battle with the Clinton administration and against the new
direction taken by the U.S. Forest Service that no longer makes
logging a priority.
</P>
<P>
   The NRC report suggests the following key recommendations for
the federal government:
</P>
<P>
   _Strengthen programs that monitor non-federal forest health.
</P>
<P>
   _Provide greater assistance to states for wild-fire suppression
and fuel management technologies.
</P>
<P>
   _Establish a national policy for non-federal forests.
</P>
<P>
   _Identify national interests in non-federal forests and create a
strategic plan for federal action.
</P>
<P>
   _Establish partnerships with private forest landowners.
</P>
<P>
   _Create educational programs focused on non-federal forests.
</P>
<P>
   _Using fiscal and tax incentives, coordinate regulatory and
technical assistance programs for landowners with large tracts of
forest.
</P>
<P>
   _Use fiscal incentives and technical assistance to promote
sustainable non-federal forests.
</P>
<P>
   _Design regulatory programs that reflect public and private
rights, responsibilities and interests in maintaining healthy
private forest lands.
</P>
<P>
   The report's regulatory language dropped like a brick on Young's
knee, his leg kicked out: ``Imagine,'' he wrote in his letter to
timber industry executives, ``the red tape of a coercive federal
regulatory scheme being applied to your private property.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that the nation needs to promote
sustainability in all forest lands. Our wildlife and watersheds
need protection on these 490 million acres of state and private
forest lands. Nearly 90 percent of threatened or endangered species
have habitat in these forests.
</P>
<P>
   If long-term forest health can be accomplished through
education, technical assistance and tax incentives _ without the
heavy hand of federal regulation _ the nation is richer _ including
the private forest owners.
</P>
<P>
   Tax and fiscal incentives can entice private owners to entered
into agreements with the federal government to use good management
practices in their forests. If these incentives are successful, the
short-term profit gained by clearcutting large tracts of land
gradually will be replaced by long-term goals that sustain profits
over decades and sustain healthy forest lands.
</P>
<P>
   A person who owns a house in a community does not have the right
to burn it down. Private ownership is not the issue _ public safety
is. The forests can be looked at the same way. Privately owned
forests are part of the larger forest ecology. Destructive forest
management practices put the nation at risk _ through soil erosion,
endangering water quality, destruction of watersheds and
elimination of wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Young could take a leadership role on this issue by accepting
and promoting some of the report's better recommendations and
criticizing those that would take an ax to private ownership.

   MORE-MAGAZINE _ Just when you think stuffed newsstand shelves

   TOAD-SIDE _ When I got that phone call last October, I never
expected things to get this out of hand. It was a friend of mine
from Orlando, calling to report the bad news splashed on the front
page of the paper: Mr. Toad's Wild Ride was going to be replaced by
a Winnie the Pooh ride. The next day, I discovered there was a Web
site to urge Toad fans to complain to Disney. (Moskot, Palm Beach

</P>
<P>
   COSTELLO-REVIEW _ Stand-up comic Sue Costello is a lot like her
brash, in-your-face sitcom. The south Boston native is loud, tacky
and outspoken. There's one major difference, though. She's funny
and surprisingly charming (in person, that is). Her show isn't. In
fact, Costello gets the award for the season's tackiest _ and
loudest _ sitcom. (Thompson, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   SCIENCE/MEDICINE (a and/or l category)

   LENS-DANGER _ AUSTIN, Texas _ State health and law enforcement

designer contact lenses. Stephen Mills, contact lens program
administrator for the Texas Department of Health, said state health
officials have received about a dozen reports of eye infections and
injuries in junior high and high school students caused by wearing
fashion contact lenses. (Elizondo Jr., Austin American-Statesman)
MOVED.

<P>
   EVERGLADE-BUDGET _ After years of doling out hundreds of
millions of dollars to help the Everglades, a skeptical Congress is
cutting back. House and Senate budget proposals could chop more
than half the $224 million that the White House wants to spend next
year on Everglades restoration and other South Florida
environmental projects. (King/Lipman, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

<P>
   MONARCH-MIGRATION _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Monarch butterflies have
begun leaving Canada and Minnesota, forming up and heading south in
their annual migration to Mexico for the winter. Scientists who
have been studying the migrations for the past five years, aided by
thousands of American and Mexican schoolchildren and adult
volunteers, want help in counting the Texas breeders and the
caterpillar larvae hatched from their eggs. (Stanley, Austin

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   For a guy with a reputation for brains, Ben Stiller has managed
to upstage _ and ultimately degrade _ himself with other body parts
recently.
</P>
<P>
   In this summer's ``There's Something About Mary,'' he was the
high-school geek who got his privates caught in his zipper on the
hottest date of his life _ only to have it become suburban legend.
</P>
<P>
   In the upcoming ``Permanent Midnight,'' based on TV writer Jerry
Stahl's memoirs of his addiction to drugs, he shoots up anywhere he
can find a vein _ even in his neck.
</P>
<P>
   And in ``Your Friends and Neighbors,'' director Neil LaBute's
dark follow-up to last year's ``In the Company of Men,'' Stiller
has several graphic semi-nude sex scenes _ in which he fails to
perform.
</P>
<P>
   Sure it takes a lot of guts to play a loser. But Stiller's not
quite ready to see it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, after these three movies,'' the 32-year-old actor
muses thoughtfully over a lobster salad lunch at Da Silvano in New
York, ``I did have to stop and wonder _ why did they see me in
these roles? People wind up believing you are the characters you
play. What does it say about me that I played three dysfunctional
guys in a row, who do hugely embarrassing things?''
</P>
<P>
   He stops to laugh at little at his own expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully,'' he adds, ``those movies say I like to push
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   They'd be telling the truth. The man who launched his career
with the critically acclaimed comedy program the ``Ben Stiller
Show'' is serious and intensely motivated, a hard worker hellbent
on success on his own terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben's not a guy driven by ego,'' LaBute explains. ``He
displayed a lot of fearlessness. I think when he was doing those
sex scenes, he was totally in the moment, totally there. He did it
and didn't think too much. But later on, when we screened the
movie, he was terrified to watch them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's weird,'' Stiller says, ``because the things I did on
screen this year are things in my life I'm so not open about _ at
all. I don't really talk about sex _ it's not my thing. But ever
since I did `Flirting With Disaster,' which also dealt with sexual
situations, I keep getting scripts like this. Stuff comes up in
your life and your work that you kind of need to deal with. Nothing
like having to work it out in public!''
</P>
<P>
   Since he began working on ``Permanent Midnight,'' Stiller became
close friends with Stahl (best known for his writing on '80s hits
like``Moonlighting'' and ``Thirtysomething''), who served as his
technical _ and spiritual _ adviser. The media's already dubbed
them ``the new Ben &AMP; Jerry.'' The pair got along so well, they
wrote an adaptation together of Budd Schulberg's 1941 classic
Hollywood novel, ``What Makes Sammy Run'' that they're pushing to
have produced.
</P>
<P>
   During filming, Stiller was recovering from his breakup with
long-term girlfriend Jeanne Tripplehorn, which may have helped him
lose the 28 pounds to bring him to junkie weight, but also made him
focus even harder on work. So after wrapping ``Midnight'' _ and
finally being able to eat again _ he got the script for the equally
dark ``Your Friends and Neighbors'' and decided to jump into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd just seen `In the Company of Men,''' he says, ``and Jason
Patric, who was producing the movie, called and asked me if I'd
meet Neil LaBute. It was one of those things, like getting a call
from Albert Brooks, where I wouldn't even have to look at a script
_ I knew I'd just do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stiller had been itching to break into drama after years of
stand-up comedy, parody and satire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It freaked out my agent,'' he says. ``None of the characters
in this movie is redeemable.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the acting part of his year has wound down, the Los
Angeles-based Stiller has rented a New York apartment where he can
concentrate on writing. He just produced a movie called ``The
Suburbans'' about a one-hit-wonder '80s band and is developing a
movie about the Hardy men _ a grown-up version of the Hardy Boys.
</P>
<P>
   He's also readying the updated version of ``Sammy'' (and plans
to write more with Stahl), wants to collaborate with LaBute and is
developing a movie about Derrick, the brain-dead male supermodel
character he invented for the VH-1 Fashion Awards. Paramount
greenlighted it for a midsized budget without even seeing a script.
</P>
<P>
   ``That whole world is ripe for parody,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   It was Joel Gallen, the executive producer of the Fashion
Awards, who suggested turning the skit, which Stiller co-wrote with
``Newsradio'' writer Drake Saylor into a movie. But then there was
the problem of turning a two-minute sketch into a two-hour film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we should take this character, who's really not that
smart, and put him into a sophisticated espionage thriller along
the lines of `The Day of the Jackal' or `Patriot Games.' So we came
up with this idea: Derrick is having a midlife crisis as he
approaches 30. He loses VH-1 Model of the Year after winning two
years in a row. He's crushed _ there's this other model named Hans
who's on the rise _ so he's having this dark night of the soul.
Meanwhile, he gets picked by a super-secret government agency to
assassinate a world leader. Turns out, in our movie, male models
are perfect assassins _ they don't really talk, and they have easy
access to world leaders. We show how every assassination in the
last 100 years was done by a male model. I want it to be incredibly
stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Stiller may be on a major roll, but he's worried it will drive
him to Workaholics Anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, acting, writing and directing fulfill the need I have
to get outside myself,'' he explains. ``Work numbs the pain. I saw
Elizabeth Shue recently; she just had a baby, and she was saying
her priorities are changing. She had this vision of all of us, her
friends, as workaholics _ becoming just a little stack of videos in
the video store, with no other lives. It's such cold comfort. But
unfortunately, the best work does come out of the most painful
times.''
</P>
<P>
   He admits, though, that there's a limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely tired of playing those loser roles,'' he says,
then pauses. ``Unless,'' he adds, ``they're really, really
funny.'' &QL;

sex scenes, he was totally in the moment, totally there. He did it
and didn't think too much. But later on, when we screened the
movie, he was terrified to watch them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's weird,'' Stiller says, ``because the things I did on
screen this year are things in my life I'm so not open about _ at
all. I don't really talk about sex _ it's not my thing. But ever
since I did `Flirting With Disaster,' which also dealt with sexual
situations, I keep getting scripts like this. Stuff comes up in
your life and your work that you kind of need to deal with. Nothing
like having to work it out in public!''
</P>
<P>
   Since he began working on ``Permanent Midnight,'' Stiller became
close friends with Stahl (best known for his writing on '80s hits
like``Moonlighting'' and ``Thirtysomething''), who served as his
technical _ and spiritual _ adviser. The media's already dubbed
them ``the new Ben &AMP; Jerry.'' The pair got along so well, they
wrote an adaptation together of Budd Schulberg's 1941 classic
Hollywood novel, ``What Makes Sammy Run'' that they're pushing to
have produced.
</P>
<P>
   During filming, Stiller was recovering from his breakup with
long-term girlfriend Jeanne Tripplehorn, which may have helped him
lose the 28 pounds to bring him to junkie weight, but also made him
focus even harder on work. So after wrapping ``Midnight'' _ and
finally being able to eat again _ he got the script for the equally
dark ``Your Friends and Neighbors'' and decided to jump into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd just seen `In the Company of Men,''' he says, ``and Jason
Patric, who was producing the movie, called and asked me if I'd
meet Neil LaBute. It was one of those things, like getting a call
from Albert Brooks, where I wouldn't even have to look at a script
_ I knew I'd just do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stiller had been itching to break into drama after years of
stand-up comedy, parody and satire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It freaked out my agent,'' he says. ``None of the characters
in this movie is redeemable.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the acting part of his year has wound down, the Los
Angeles-based Stiller has rented a New York apartment where he can
concentrate on writing. He just produced a movie called ``The
Suburbans'' about a one-hit-wonder '80s band and is developing a
movie about the Hardy men _ a grown-up version of the Hardy Boys.
</P>
<P>
   He's also readying the updated version of ``Sammy'' (and plans
to write more with Stahl), wants to collaborate with LaBute and is
developing a movie about Derrick, the brain-dead male supermodel
character he invented for the VH-1 Fashion Awards. Paramount
greenlighted it for a midsized budget without even seeing a script.
</P>
<P>
   ``That whole world is ripe for parody,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   It was Joel Gallen, the executive producer of the Fashion
Awards, who suggested turning the skit, which Stiller co-wrote with
``Newsradio'' writer Drake Saylor into a movie. But then there was
the problem of turning a two-minute sketch into a two-hour film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we should take this character, who's really not that
smart, and put him into a sophisticated espionage thriller along
the lines of `The Day of the Jackal' or `Patriot Games.' So we came
up with this idea: Derrick is having a midlife crisis as he
approaches 30. He loses VH-1 Model of the Year after winning two
years in a row. He's crushed _ there's this other model named Hans
who's on the rise _ so he's having this dark night of the soul.
Meanwhile, he gets picked by a super-secret government agency to
assassinate a world leader. Turns out, in our movie, male models
are perfect assassins _ they don't really talk, and they have easy
access to world leaders. We show how every assassination in the
last 100 years was done by a male model. I want it to be incredibly
stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Stiller may be on a major roll, but he's worried it will drive
him to Workaholics Anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, acting, writing and directing fulfill the need I have
to get outside myself,'' he explains. ``Work numbs the pain. I saw
Elizabeth Shue recently; she just had a baby, and she was saying
her priorities are changing. She had this vision of all of us, her
friends, as workaholics _ becoming just a little stack of videos in
the video store, with no other lives. It's such cold comfort. But
unfortunately, the best work does come out of the most painful
times.''
</P>
<P>
   He admits, though, that there's a limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely tired of playing those loser roles,'' he says,
then pauses. ``Unless,'' he adds, ``they're really, really
funny.'' &QL;

   IDENTITY-THEFT (San Francisco) _ John Santner, 33, likes to
collect names, including the famous. He had 160 them when the
police arrested him last October. Most of the identification cards
confiscated from the man listed people whose names were
``borrowed'' to commit crimes. By JIM HERRON ZAMORA.

<P>
   IDENTITY-THEFT-VICTIMS (San Francisco) _ Identity theft, one of
the fastest growing crimes in the nation, is a type of fraud in
which a criminal takes another's personal information and uses it
to apply for credit. The con artist can then make thousands of
dollars in fraudulent purchases and have it all billed to an
unwitting victim, who often faces an uphill struggle to restore
credit. By JIM HERRON ZAMORA.

   SCHOOL-BUS (Candelaria, Texas) _ This fall, perhaps for the
first time since it opened near the turn of the century, the
Candelaria school remained closed. Its 38 students are being bused
to Presidio, a 90-minute ride away. And townspeople are outraged
that a distant school board, with little notice, decided to shutter
the schoolhouse. By JOHN MacCORMACK. (Photos available on Wieck

   BBN-McGWIRE (St. Louis) _ As soon as he had finished talking to
the president and signing his bat for the Hall of Fame, Mark
McGwire walked over to his locker, swerved around a silver
champagne bucket and started packing his big red duffel bag. He
then realized he needed new shoes because the old shoes were on
their way to Cooperstown, N.Y. By GWEN KNAPP.

<P>
   FBN-49ERS-STADIUM (San Francisco) _ The new president of the San
Francisco 49ers says the estimated cost of the team's proposed
stadium project has skyrocketed to more than $500 million _ and he
can't promise the project will ever be built. The latest estimate
represents a $200 million jump in the cost. By RACHEL GORDON.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CANDELARIA, Texas _ The American Civil War still was a living
memory when the campesinos, or farm workers, built a one-room adobe
schoolhouse on a bluff above this West Texas border town.
</P>
<P>
   Named for a waxy Chihuahuan Desert plant once favored by
smugglers, Candelaria is found _ literally _ where the pavement
ends some 50 miles upriver from Presidio.
</P>
<P>
   Many of its three dozen families have close ties to San Antonio
del Bravo, across the Rio Grande in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   But this fall, perhaps for the first time since it opened near
the turn of the century, the Candelaria school remained closed. Its
38 students are being bused to Presidio, 50 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was a student there, and he is 90 now. Some of my
brothers and sisters and all eight of my children studied there,''
said Olivia Lozano, 65, a Candelaria resident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an excellent school. My children learned a lot, and
they were treated very well,'' Lozano recalled.
</P>
<P>
   In late summer, without consulting parents or teachers, the
Presidio School Board voted 7-1 to shut it down. Candelaria's three
teachers and some 40 students _ down to pre-kindergarten _ were
assigned to Presidio schools.
</P>
<P>
   The district's top administrator later cited several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The school had 38 students, three certified teachers and the
budget was $173,000 for this year. Another factor was a severe
teacher shortage at the elementary campus in Presidio,''
Superintendent Sharon Morrow said.
</P>
<P>
   Morrow said results on standardized tests recently had dipped in
Candelaria, and she mentioned the difficulty of keeping track of
things at such a distant campus.
</P>
<P>
   Although high school students long have ridden the bus from
Candelaria to Presidio, it is a new and harsh experience for the
other children, some as young as 4.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of trudging a block or so to school in Candelaria, they
now awaken in darkness to board the bus at 6:15 a.m. for a
90-minute ride along Farm Road 170.
</P>
<P>
   The narrow, two-lane blacktop is a roller coaster of dips and
hills.
</P>
<P>
   It runs part way through open rangeland where burros, cattle and
horses run freely, and when there is rain, the bus is delayed at
low-water crossings.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Texas Education Agency, which oversees state
schools, said there are no guidelines or limits on how many miles
or hours children may travel by bus to school.
</P>
<P>
   The TEA spokesman also said there are no rules or laws that
require districts to inform or consult with anyone before closing a
school.
</P>
<P>
   In Candelaria, surprise quickly turned to anger over the closing
of the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are already some children not going to school. They get
too sick, throwing up and all that. They get too nervous,'' said
Pilar Avila, 33, whose daughter Samantha, 5, and son Issac, 6, now
ride the bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son wakes up at 1 a.m. screaming that the bus is leaving
already. What's going to happen by the end of the year? The kids
will be all messed up,'' Avila said.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting two weeks ago, parents from Candelaria appealed to
the board to reconsider its decision. By coincidence, rains that
night kept the bus with its cargo of children from getting back to
Candelaria until 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   But the board has offered no promise of relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone over it, and we're acting in the best interests of
all the children, not just a few. That's all I can say,'' school
board President Carlos Nieto said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no such thing as a bad decision, if you have local
control,'' Nieto added, before referring inquiries to Morrow.
</P>
<P>
   Morrow described the change as a ``trial closure,'' but said
that if the Candelaria school reopens at all, it only will be for
the younger children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone gets real excited about this, but think about day
care. Half the population of urban America is delivering children
at 6:30 in the morning and picking them up at 6 at night,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Morrow said the Candelaria situation would be reviewed in
January.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll take a hard look at the data, and we'll make a decision
by March or April. The reason for the late decision, which I very
much regret, was the budget information, the test information and
the teacher shortage,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Morrow rejected the notion that Candelaria children might be
better off attending a ``local school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider this going to school locally. This is the
community school,'' she said of Presidio.
</P>
<P>
   ``That school has been part of the culture and tradition there,
but most of those people shop in Presidio. It's still part of that
community,'' Morrow said.
</P>
<P>

<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the district added a second bus to the Candelaria run
to get the younger children home earlier. The bus also has pillows
and blankets for the ride.
</P>
<P>
   But these measures have done little to appease Candelaria
residents, some of whom complain that their children are sick or
exhausted because of the long commute.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are they going to learn if they come home like this?''
said Cruz Alarcon, 34, motioning to a sleeping son one day after
school.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the three former Candelaria teachers now teach in
Presidio.
</P>
<P>
   The third, Johnnie Chambers, 68, who began teaching at
Candelaria in 1971 is on extended sick leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm heartbroken,'' Chambers said of the school's closure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very traumatic thing to see the disregard (school board
members) seem to have for these little bitty kids and their
education. It's the end of a 100-year-old tradition,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers said she believed the school was closed because of
``money and politics,'' rather than academics.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've wanted to close that school forever. I don't think
we've had an administration that didn't want to close it at least
once,'' she said.

   ``There's no crying in baseball!'' _ Tom Hanks in ``A League of
Their Own.''
</P>
<P>
   The heck there isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about an All-American story. The scene Tuesday night when
Mark McGwire hid that frozen rope for No. 62 was perhaps the most
uplifting in the history of modern sports.
</P>
<P>
   What a series of images!
</P>
<P>
   A drive that flew under the radar and just barely made it over
the fence.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire missing first, like an excited T-baller, laughing at
himself as he returned to the bag.
</P>
<P>
   The longest trip around the bases you've ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   Our new home run king lifting his boy and tossing him into the
air, kissing the boy's face, a proud father with a beaming son.
</P>
<P>
   Hugs from everyone, including Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   Tears from many, from McGwire to the great Jack Buck.
</P>
<P>
   It was the perfect climax to the greatest sports season any of
us have ever seen. There have been many fascinating sidebars to the
action on the field all summer, but mostly it's been about the
character of two men. How lucky for the game of baseball that it
was McGwire and Sosa, rather than any of the other gifted players
who display such jerky, me-first behavior. Much of the romance of
this story never would have materialized had the leading men been
growling showboaters.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy and Mark, though _ they're good guys. They have a
video-game star quality that appeals even to non-fans.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has had a few missteps with the media, but in the last
month he has learned to go with the madness rather than engage in a
futile battle to quell the madness surrounding him. He's having the
time of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us in Chicago remember when Sammy wasn't always so
popular with fans, the media, even his teammates. As recently as
last season, Cubs manager Jim Riggleman lashed out at Sosa for
selfish, individualistic play, and in spring training, Sosa openly
pleaded with teammates to cease with the ``back-stabbing,'' as he
called it.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's image problems used to be much worse. When he played
across town with the White Sox, he also played into the worst
stereotypes _ a world of talent, sure, but no sense of team. The
kind of player who is more concerned with looking good and hitting
home runs than winning a pennant.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe some of that criticism was fair; maybe some of it wasn't.
But there was more to even the unpolished Sosa than met the eye.
Asked once about the constant ridicule of his English, Sosa's reply
was brilliant: His English was a whole lot better than the
Spanish-speaking skills of most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The more time Sosa spent in the United States, the more
comfortable he felt _ and the more we learned about his
infectiously charming personality. He's quick-witted, he's
generous, he's fun-loving, and he's having an absolute blast on the
field and off. With the exception of Michael Jordan, Sosa is the
most popular athlete in Chicago in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has donated millions of dollars to help abused children;
Sosa has given so much back to his homeland and to the
underprivileged here, he's known as ``Sammy Claus.'' Athletes
shouldn't be role models _ unless we're talking about the public
behavior of jocks like this.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire and Sosa took very different roads to the mountaintop,
but once they reached it nearly simultaneously, they both threw
their arms to the sky and invited the country to share in their
triumph. In a summer plagued by hurricanes and terrorists, plane
crashes and presidential lust, these two men have given us
something to cheer about.

</P>
<P>
   Tribes of the Iroquois Nation believe that the Finger Lakes were
formed when the Creator's hands raked across the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Geologists say that eons ago, glaciers lumbered past a slab of
wet cement we now call central New York State and couldn't resist.
In any case, nature provided 11 fingers, perhaps because it would
take more than two hands to count all the region's charms.
</P>
<P>
   The supply of wineries to visit, inns to settle down in and
historic Main Streets to stroll in the Finger Lakes seems
inexhaustible _ especially in the fall foliage season. So an autumn
tour of the region requires some choices.
</P>
<P>
   One suggestion: stick to the biggest lakes, Seneca and Cayuga,
which are in the middle and are each about 35 miles long. Views
from either side of these, with little sightseeing boats passing
between sharply rising hillsides, conjure up a miniature Lake
Geneva (or, in the case of 632-foot-deep Seneca, Loch Ness).
</P>
<P>
   Along 19th-century streets in towns like Geneva, Corning,
Hammondsport and Skaneateles, old brick storefronts have lost some
of their right angles. But they wear their years with dignity and
an honesty typical of a region where farm stands work on the honor
system.
</P>
<P>
   Foliage season is usually mid-September to mid-October. For
updates, call Finger Lakes National Forest at (607) 546-4470. The
region is about six hours from New York City via the Thruway to
Exit 16, and Route 17.
 &UR; EVENTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Through Nov. 1, ``Warp and Weft,'' Navajo weaving from the 1870s
to the 1970s, will be at the Rockwell Museum, 111 Cedar St.,
</P>
<P>
   Corning. The 1893 red-brick Romanesque Revival building has a
large permanent collection of Western art, including Remington and
Bierstadt, and more than 2,000 pieces of art glass by Frederick
Carder, a founder of Steuben Glass. Open Monday to Saturday 9 a.m.
to 5 p.m., Sunday noon to 5 p.m. Admission: $5, seniors $4.50, ages
6 to 17 $2.50; (607) 937-5386.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Langhorne Clemens spent summers in Elmira and is buried
there in Woodlawn Cemetery. What would Mark Twain have thought
about a popular Elmira activity: flying without a motor?
</P>
<P>
   The surrounding flat lands are blessed with thermals ideal for
gliders. Sept. 19 is Community Soaring Day and Kite-Citement at the
Harris Hill Gliderport, off Route 17. Glider rides are $30 (free
for disabled children), or learn kite-making; (607) 734-3128.
</P>
<P>
   This one is a real no-brainer: the Great Canandaigua Scarecrow
Contest. About 75 locally made straw persons compete to see which
can scare the most birds off Main Street in Canandaigua, from Sept.
26 through Oct. 10. Free; (716) 396-0300.
</P>
<P>
   The Buckwheat Harvest Festival, at the Yates County Fairgrounds
in Penn Yan, will feature rides, food and fireworks Sept. 25 to 27.
Hours: 4 to 11 p.m. Sept. 25, 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Sept. 26 (when
Billy Ray Cyrus sings) and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sept. 27. Admission:
$6; (800) 868-9283.
 &UR; SIGHTSEEING &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The sun-washed hillsides of the Finger Lakes were discovered by
winemakers in the mid-1800s. Now, there are dozens of vintners
along the major lakes, which provide a tempering effect on the cold
climate. Whites and sparkling wines are the region's forte.
</P>
<P>
   Route 14 on Seneca's western shore is lined with wineries, but
off the main road, Castel Grisch on Route 28 above Watkins Glen,
offers a less-trafficked view of the lake amid Rhineland trappings.
Open daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; (607) 535-9614.
</P>
<P>
   On Seneca's east shore, Wagner Winery, Route 414 in Lodi, has
beer tastings, too. Open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily, (607) 582-6450.
</P>
<P>
   For wine-tour maps, contact the Seneca Lake Winery Association,
(315) 536-9996; the Cayuga Wine Trail, (800) 684-5217, or the Keuka
Lake Wine Route, (800) 440-4898.
</P>
<P>
   The views of the cascades in Watkins Glen State Park are
literally breathtaking, if you start the 1.5-mile trail from the
bottom, on Franklin Street in Watkins Glen.
</P>
<P>
   As you ascend the 832 steps to the top of the 650-foot glen, you
pass along, over and under 18 waterfalls (runoff from the rocky
walls can leave the trail slick). Park on village streets and walk
in free. A shuttle ($2.50) lets you start at the top; (607)
535-4511.
</P>
<P>
   Less splashy are the falls in Fillmore Glen State Park _ named
after a not-so-splashy President, Millard Fillmore. A reproduction
of the tiny rudimentary cabin in which he was born in 1800, five
miles away, is off the parking lot ($4 a car). The 1.8-mile trail
through the surrounding woods should afford some great leaf
watching. Open dawn to dusk on Route 38 in Moravia; (315) 497-0130
</P>
<P>
   Among the floating excursions for leaf fanciers are Captain
Bill's Seneca Lake Cruises, aboard the Stroller IV, a jaunty boat
from the 1930's decked out in Philippine mahogany.
</P>
<P>
   In foliage season, 50-minute tours depart every other hour
starting at 11 a.m. Fare: $7.50, ages 2 to 12, $3.50. Boats leave
from the foot of Franklin Street in Watkins Glen; (607) 535-4541.
</P>
<P>
   The modest-sized Sciencenter, 601 First St., just off Route 13
north of Ithaca, is full of hands-on displays that will teach and
entertain young children. Your little Indiana Jones can dig for
real fossils. Open Tuesday to Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday
noon to 5. Admission: $4.50, ages 4 to 12 $3.50; (607) 272-0600.
</P>
<P>
   Don't let memories of all those duplicate housewarming gifts
keep you from the Corning Museum of Glass and Glass Center, 151
Centerway, Corning, (607) 974-8271. A head of Amenhotep II of
Egypt, made between 1436 and 1411 B.C., is the earliest known glass
portrait, and a cut-glass table from 1878 weighs more than half a
ton. There's not a casserole in sight until you reach the gift
shop. Open daily 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $6, seniors $5, ages 6
to 17 $4.
</P>
<P>
   The Farm Sanctuary, eight miles west of Watkins Glen, off Route
23, is a 175-acre refuge for abused livestock. It's filled with
cows, chickens and pigs. Admission is free; guided tours on
weekends in September and October cost $2, ages 4 to 12, $1; (607)
583-2225.
 &UR; WHERE TO STAY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Radisson, 125 Denison Parkway East, Corning, (607) 962-5000,
fax (607) 962-4166, looks like a concrete bunker plopped at the
foot of graceful Market Street. But the 177-room hotel, with an
indoor pool, is a stroll from the Corning and Rockwell museums.
Rooms are comfortable and contemporary, with about half redone last
winter in dark-green tones. Rates from $139.
</P>
<P>
   True to its name, the Ramada Geneva Lakefront, 41 Lakefront
Drive, Geneva, (800) 990-0907, fax (315) 789-4351, is on the
northern tip of Seneca Lake. Its 148 rooms are most notable for the
views (91 face the water). There's an indoor pool. Rates: $109 to
$139 till Oct. 1, $89 to $109 after.
</P>
<P>
   Budget: For a traditional roadside motor lodge, try the
Longhouse Lodge Motel, Route 14 at Abrams Road, Watkins Glen,
telephone and fax (607) 535-2565. The 25 rooms were redone last
summer, and 21 have rockers outside the doors to enjoy the hillside
Seneca Lake view, while 4 are higher up the hill in a separate
house. A VCR, with movies, rents for $5. Rates: $68 to $88, with
Continental breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Similar is the Best Western Marshall Manor, Route 14,
Horseheads, telephone and fax (607) 739-3891, conveniently situated
between Seneca Lake and Elmira. Families can make fast getaways in
the morning since the 40 clean, simple rooms have sinks inside and
outside the bathrooms. Rates: $63 to Oct. 10, $52 after, with
Continental breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury: Geneva on the Lake, 1001 Lochland Road (Route 14),
Geneva, (800) 343-6382, fax (315) 789-0322, is modeled after an
Italian Renaissance villa, with 26 rooms and 4 more in a
contemporary town house. A parterre garden leads to the lakeside
pool.
</P>
<P>
   The Library Suite, decorated with Stickley furniture, has a
coffered ceiling and fireplace, and the shelves lining the walls
contain books from the collection of the estate's original owners.
Rates: $133 to $525, with Continental breakfast, bottle of wine and
fruit basket.
</P>
<P>
   A soft-pink wedding cake of a house built in 1851 is now the
Rose Inn, 813 Auburn Road (Route 34), Ithaca; (607) 533-7905, fax
(607) 533-7908. A spiral staircase of Honduran mahogany coils
majestically up to a cupola.
</P>
<P>
   Among the main house's 15 rooms, decorated with period
furniture, are four suites with whirlpool baths. The grounds
include a pretty little formal garden. Rates: $100 to $275, with
full breakfast.
 &UR; WHERE TO EAT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cafe Alfresca, 45 Shethar St., in Hammondsport, at the southern
end of Keuka Lake, overlooks the village green and its gingerbread
bandstand, an ideal place to enjoy one of the delicious warm panini
sandwiches, soups, salads or thin pizzas _ all $4 to $4.95. If
there is an autumn chill, move inside to a rocking chair and sip a
giant cappuccino ($3.25).
</P>
<P>
   Works by local artists adorn the walls, and there's live music
Saturday nights (open 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. other days). A meal for
two with drinks: $20; (607) 569-2009.
</P>
<P>
   Framboise, 9 East Genesee St., is an airy storefront with tall
windows looking out onto the center of Skaneateles, southwest of
Syracuse. Dried and fresh flower arrangements adorn the tables in
the two dining areas.
</P>
<P>
   Appetizers include spring rolls in orange-cranberry sauce with a
pile of steamed julienned vegetables; cioppino, a fish stew made
with tomatoes; or chicken Maasdam _ a breast stuffed with
asparagus, roasted peppers and cream cheese and wrapped in puff
pastry _ are among the entrees. Three-course dinner for two with
wine: about $65; (315) 685-7196.
</P>
<P>
   Tables in the publike London Underground, 69 East Market St.,
Corning, are amply spaced. Get past the endless menu descriptions _
``local ostrich sirloin with stone-ground mustard glaze and Vidalia
onion compote,'' for example, followed by ``basil-infused chicken
breast with sauce fines herbes, bowtie pasta and a trio of sauteed
peppers'' _ and the food speaks for itself. Dinner for two with
wine: $75; (607) 962-2345.
</P>
<P>
   The Sherwood Inn, a stately historic inn at 26 West Genesee St.,
Skaneateles, has a formal dining room and a tavern; in the latter,
the Fruit Fantasia ($8.95) is a generous pile of fresh fruit,
chicken or tuna salad, date-nut bread and sherbet; in the dining
room, the accent is on standards like steak and prime rib, with
dinner for two with wine about $90; (315) 685-3405.
</P>
<P>
   While dining in the rear sun room of the Thendara Inn and
Restaurant, 4356 East Lake Road (Route 364), Canandaigua, we saw
one couple wed beside the lake, while a few tables away, another
toasted their 50th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Among the appetizers is brie en croute with portobello
mushrooms; for main courses, there's herb-encrusted swordfish with
ginger lemongrass sauce or marinated grilled chicken breast with
gazpacho salsa. Addlepated service was a discordant note. Dinner
for two with wine: $90 to $100. Closed Monday and Tuesday after
Oct.1. Reservations recommended; (716) 394-4868.

   Tribes of the Iroquois Nation believe that the Finger Lakes were
formed when the Creator's hands raked across the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Geologists say that eons ago, glaciers lumbered past a slab of
wet cement we now call central New York State and couldn't resist.
In any case, nature provided 11 fingers, perhaps because it would
take more than two hands to count all the region's charms.
</P>
<P>
   The supply of wineries to visit, inns to settle down in and
historic Main Streets to stroll in the Finger Lakes seems
inexhaustible _ especially in the fall foliage season. So an autumn
tour of the region requires some choices.
</P>
<P>
   One suggestion: stick to the biggest lakes, Seneca and Cayuga,
which are in the middle and are each about 35 miles long. Views
from either side of these, with little sightseeing boats passing
between sharply rising hillsides, conjure up a miniature Lake
Geneva (or, in the case of 632-foot-deep Seneca, Loch Ness).
</P>
<P>
   Along 19th-century streets in towns like Geneva, Corning,
Hammondsport and Skaneateles, old brick storefronts have lost some
of their right angles. But they wear their years with dignity and
an honesty typical of a region where farm stands work on the honor
system.
</P>
<P>
   Foliage season is usually mid-September to mid-October. For
updates, call Finger Lakes National Forest at (607) 546-4470. The
region is about six hours from New York City via the Thruway to
Exit 16, and Route 17.
 &UR; EVENTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Through Nov. 1, ``Warp and Weft,'' Navajo weaving from the 1870s
to the 1970s, will be at the Rockwell Museum, 111 Cedar St.,
</P>
<P>
   Corning. The 1893 red-brick Romanesque Revival building has a
large permanent collection of Western art, including Remington and
Bierstadt, and more than 2,000 pieces of art glass by Frederick
Carder, a founder of Steuben Glass. Open Monday to Saturday 9 a.m.
to 5 p.m., Sunday noon to 5 p.m. Admission: $5, seniors $4.50, ages
6 to 17 $2.50; (607) 937-5386.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Langhorne Clemens spent summers in Elmira and is buried
there in Woodlawn Cemetery. What would Mark Twain have thought
about a popular Elmira activity: flying without a motor?
</P>
<P>
   The surrounding flat lands are blessed with thermals ideal for
gliders. Sept. 19 is Community Soaring Day and Kite-Citement at the
Harris Hill Gliderport, off Route 17. Glider rides are $30 (free
for disabled children), or learn kite-making; (607) 734-3128.
</P>
<P>
   This one is a real no-brainer: the Great Canandaigua Scarecrow
Contest. About 75 locally made straw persons compete to see which
can scare the most birds off Main Street in Canandaigua, from Sept.
26 through Oct. 10. Free; (716) 396-0300.
</P>
<P>
   The Buckwheat Harvest Festival, at the Yates County Fairgrounds
in Penn Yan, will feature rides, food and fireworks Sept. 25 to 27.
Hours: 4 to 11 p.m. Sept. 25, 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Sept. 26 (when
Billy Ray Cyrus sings) and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sept. 27. Admission:
$6; (800) 868-9283.
 &UR; SIGHTSEEING &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The sun-washed hillsides of the Finger Lakes were discovered by
winemakers in the mid-1800s. Now, there are dozens of vintners
along the major lakes, which provide a tempering effect on the cold
climate. Whites and sparkling wines are the region's forte.
</P>
<P>
   Route 14 on Seneca's western shore is lined with wineries, but
off the main road, Castel Grisch on Route 28 above Watkins Glen,
offers a less-trafficked view of the lake amid Rhineland trappings.
Open daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; (607) 535-9614.
</P>
<P>
   On Seneca's east shore, Wagner Winery, Route 414 in Lodi, has
beer tastings, too. Open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily, (607) 582-6450.
</P>
<P>
   For wine-tour maps, contact the Seneca Lake Winery Association,
(315) 536-9996; the Cayuga Wine Trail, (800) 684-5217, or the Keuka
Lake Wine Route, (800) 440-4898.
</P>
<P>
   The views of the cascades in Watkins Glen State Park are
literally breathtaking, if you start the 1.5-mile trail from the
bottom, on Franklin Street in Watkins Glen.
</P>
<P>
   As you ascend the 832 steps to the top of the 650-foot glen, you
pass along, over and under 18 waterfalls (runoff from the rocky
walls can leave the trail slick). Park on village streets and walk
in free. A shuttle ($2.50) lets you start at the top; (607)
535-4511.
</P>
<P>
   Less splashy are the falls in Fillmore Glen State Park _ named
after a not-so-splashy President, Millard Fillmore. A reproduction
of the tiny rudimentary cabin in which he was born in 1800, five
miles away, is off the parking lot ($4 a car). The 1.8-mile trail
through the surrounding woods should afford some great leaf
watching. Open dawn to dusk on Route 38 in Moravia; (315) 497-0130
</P>
<P>
   Among the floating excursions for leaf fanciers are Captain
Bill's Seneca Lake Cruises, aboard the Stroller IV, a jaunty boat
from the 1930's decked out in Philippine mahogany.
</P>
<P>
   In foliage season, 50-minute tours depart every other hour
starting at 11 a.m. Fare: $7.50, ages 2 to 12, $3.50. Boats leave
from the foot of Franklin Street in Watkins Glen; (607) 535-4541.
</P>
<P>
   The modest-sized Sciencenter, 601 First St., just off Route 13
north of Ithaca, is full of hands-on displays that will teach and
entertain young children. Your little Indiana Jones can dig for
real fossils. Open Tuesday to Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday
noon to 5. Admission: $4.50, ages 4 to 12 $3.50; (607) 272-0600.
</P>
<P>
   Don't let memories of all those duplicate housewarming gifts
keep you from the Corning Museum of Glass and Glass Center, 151
Centerway, Corning, (607) 974-8271. A head of Amenhotep II of
Egypt, made between 1436 and 1411 B.C., is the earliest known glass
portrait, and a cut-glass table from 1878 weighs more than half a
ton. There's not a casserole in sight until you reach the gift
shop. Open daily 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $6, seniors $5, ages 6
to 17 $4.
</P>
<P>
   The Farm Sanctuary, eight miles west of Watkins Glen, off Route
23, is a 175-acre refuge for abused livestock. It's filled with
cows, chickens and pigs. Admission is free; guided tours on
weekends in September and October cost $2, ages 4 to 12, $1; (607)
583-2225.
 &UR; WHERE TO STAY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Radisson, 125 Denison Parkway East, Corning, (607) 962-5000,
fax (607) 962-4166, looks like a concrete bunker plopped at the
foot of graceful Market Street. But the 177-room hotel, with an
indoor pool, is a stroll from the Corning and Rockwell museums.
Rooms are comfortable and contemporary, with about half redone last
winter in dark-green tones. Rates from $139.
</P>
<P>
   True to its name, the Ramada Geneva Lakefront, 41 Lakefront
Drive, Geneva, (800) 990-0907, fax (315) 789-4351, is on the
northern tip of Seneca Lake. Its 148 rooms are most notable for the
views (91 face the water). There's an indoor pool. Rates: $109 to
$139 till Oct. 1, $89 to $109 after.
</P>
<P>
   Budget: For a traditional roadside motor lodge, try the
Longhouse Lodge Motel, Route 14 at Abrams Road, Watkins Glen,
telephone and fax (607) 535-2565. The 25 rooms were redone last
summer, and 21 have rockers outside the doors to enjoy the hillside
Seneca Lake view, while 4 are higher up the hill in a separate
house. A VCR, with movies, rents for $5. Rates: $68 to $88, with
Continental breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Similar is the Best Western Marshall Manor, Route 14,
Horseheads, telephone and fax (607) 739-3891, conveniently situated
between Seneca Lake and Elmira. Families can make fast getaways in
the morning since the 40 clean, simple rooms have sinks inside and
outside the bathrooms. Rates: $63 to Oct. 10, $52 after, with
Continental breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury: Geneva on the Lake, 1001 Lochland Road (Route 14),
Geneva, (800) 343-6382, fax (315) 789-0322, is modeled after an
Italian Renaissance villa, with 26 rooms and 4 more in a
contemporary town house. A parterre garden leads to the lakeside
pool.
</P>
<P>
   The Library Suite, decorated with Stickley furniture, has a
coffered ceiling and fireplace, and the shelves lining the walls
contain books from the collection of the estate's original owners.
Rates: $133 to $525, with Continental breakfast, bottle of wine and
fruit basket.
</P>
<P>
   A soft-pink wedding cake of a house built in 1851 is now the
Rose Inn, 813 Auburn Road (Route 34), Ithaca; (607) 533-7905, fax
(607) 533-7908. A spiral staircase of Honduran mahogany coils
majestically up to a cupola.
</P>
<P>
   Among the main house's 15 rooms, decorated with period
furniture, are four suites with whirlpool baths. The grounds
include a pretty little formal garden. Rates: $100 to $275, with
full breakfast.
 &UR; WHERE TO EAT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cafe Alfresca, 45 Shethar St., in Hammondsport, at the southern
end of Keuka Lake, overlooks the village green and its gingerbread
bandstand, an ideal place to enjoy one of the delicious warm panini
sandwiches, soups, salads or thin pizzas _ all $4 to $4.95. If
there is an autumn chill, move inside to a rocking chair and sip a
giant cappuccino ($3.25).
</P>
<P>
   Works by local artists adorn the walls, and there's live music
Saturday nights (open 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. other days). A meal for
two with drinks: $20; (607) 569-2009.
</P>
<P>
   Framboise, 9 East Genesee St., is an airy storefront with tall
windows looking out onto the center of Skaneateles, southwest of
Syracuse. Dried and fresh flower arrangements adorn the tables in
the two dining areas.
</P>
<P>
   Appetizers include spring rolls in orange-cranberry sauce with a
pile of steamed julienned vegetables; cioppino, a fish stew made
with tomatoes; or chicken Maasdam _ a breast stuffed with
asparagus, roasted peppers and cream cheese and wrapped in puff
pastry _ are among the entrees. Three-course dinner for two with
wine: about $65; (315) 685-7196.
</P>
<P>
   Tables in the publike London Underground, 69 East Market St.,
Corning, are amply spaced. Get past the endless menu descriptions _
``local ostrich sirloin with stone-ground mustard glaze and Vidalia
onion compote,'' for example, followed by ``basil-infused chicken
breast with sauce fines herbes, bowtie pasta and a trio of sauteed
peppers'' _ and the food speaks for itself. Dinner for two with
wine: $75; (607) 962-2345.
</P>
<P>
   The Sherwood Inn, a stately historic inn at 26 West Genesee St.,
Skaneateles, has a formal dining room and a tavern; in the latter,
the Fruit Fantasia ($8.95) is a generous pile of fresh fruit,
chicken or tuna salad, date-nut bread and sherbet; in the dining
room, the accent is on standards like steak and prime rib, with

MAYOR VOWS NO MORE PUBLIC HELP FOR 49ERS STADIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RACHEL GORDON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mayor Willie Brown said he would not seek
additional public support for a new San Francisco 49ers stadium
amid indications from the team's management that the project may
never be built because of rising costs.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Thrailkill, the interim president of the San Francisco
49ers, said last week the cost of the stadium had risen $200
million to more than $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   The team wants to build a stadium and commercial center at
Candlestick Point. The projected cost of the two projects is now at
least $725 million, Thrailkill told KPIX-TV in a Friday interivew.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the project would go forward, Thrailkill said: ``I'm
very hopeful that it will happen, but if somebody asked could I
promise to make it happen, the answer is no. I can't promise
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said Tuesday the city would not exceed the $100 million in
revenue bonds narrowly approved by voters in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   He said if the stadium did cost more, the 49ers would have to
raise the additional money, ``or they'll go back to the voters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have asked the voters for $100 million, and that's frankly
all I intend to ask the voters for. Period,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Denise DeBartolo York, chairwoman of the team's parent company,
Edward J. DeBartolo Corp., put a damper on the stadium project in
January when she said the tab was running $175 million more than
the original $325 million estimate. The adjacent mall had been
estimated at $200 million for a total project cost of $525 million.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, York suggested the stadium-mall be sidelined until
a more thorough cost analysis was done. But team and city officials
continued to support the project.
</P>
<P>
   Brown would not comment on whether he thought the stadium, a
project he supported wholeheartedly and campaigned for tirelessly,
was in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't engage in speculation,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Kofi Bonner, the mayor's point man on the 49ers project, said
even Thrailkill's most recent remarks didn't deter his optimism.
When asked if the stadium would be built, he said, ``Of course.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in this battle a lot of times,'' he said. ``I've
been involved in a lot of big projects, and there are always a lot
of ups and downs. I think this is normal, actually.''
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Michael Yaki, chairman of the Board of Supervisors
Economic Development, Transportation and Technology Commission,
said he hoped the matter could be straightened out soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think it would be appreciated by the people who
supported the stadium project, including myself, if the 49ers would
give us some clarification on whether they're going to build the
project or not,'' Yaki said.
</P>
<P>
   Thrailkill, the DeBartolo Corp.'s chief operating officer who
was named interim president of the 49ers in July, could not
immediately be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Money isn't the only issue plaguing the project. In July, former
team President Carmen Policy, who had been a key player in the new
stadium plans, announced he was leaving the team. And 49ers
co-owner Eddie DeBartolo is being investigated by federal
authorities in connection with a casino gambling license he had
sought in Louisiana. City Hall sources said the stadium plan had
been put virtually on hold until DeBartolo's problems were
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Ventresca, who helped lead the unsuccessful campaign to
defeat last year's two stadium-mall ballot measures, said he wasn't
so sure San Francisco taxpayers wouldn't be stuck with a bigger
bill. He said city officials should pull the plug now.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the project is so unstable and problematic, it clearly
raises the specter that additional public subsidy could be drained
from the city's treasury,'' said Ventresca, chairman of the
Committee to Stop the Giveaway.
</P>
<P>
   Under the voter-approved stadium deal, the city would put up
$100 million, money that would be paid back with tax money from the
mall.
</P>
<P>
   The Candlestick project calls for a new 75,000-seat football
stadium for the 49ers and a 1.4 million-square-foot mall,
Candlestick Mills.
</P>
<P>
   It would be developed by 49ers Stadium Associates, a partnership
that includes mall builder Mills Corp. and DeBartolo Entertainment
Co. Plans call for completing construction by the 2002 season and
playing host to the Super Bowl the following year.

MUSHROOM SEASON HAS RUSSIANS IN FUNGI FRENZY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV
 &HT;    c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   ODRINOVO, Russia _ With the practiced eye of a hunter stalking
his quarry, Mikhail Volkov spied the two men hurrying across the
boggy field toward a damp thicket, their knives bared, their eyes
scanning from side to side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Locals. They're hunting,'' Volkov whispered. ``Let's follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving stealthily, Volkov slipped behind the pair and tailed
them at a safe distance until they unwittingly led him to the place
he was looking for. The spot was covered with low spruce trees and
mossy ground, prime territory for Russia's favorite summer pastime
_ mushroom picking.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the tricky part. Anyone at home in the woods can find
mushrooms, especially when someone else leads you to them. But
knowing which mushrooms to pick can be a matter of life and death.
</P>
<P>
   Russians, who flock to the countryside on weekends as summer
wanes, are supremely confident of their ability to distinguish
between tasty delicacies and lethal toadstools.
</P>
<P>
   But this confidence is often tragically misplaced. Russia's
weekend fungus warriors suffer an alarmingly high number of
casualties. Since mid-July, nine people have died and 180 have been
poisoned from bad mushrooms, according to Lydia Terezhkova of
Russia's Federal Health Inspection Service. And this is a good
year. Last year, 34 died of mushroom poisoning across Russia in
July and August.
</P>
<P>
   The culprit, Terezhkova said, is usually the ``death cap,''
amanita phalloides, known to Russians as the ``belaya poganka,'' or
pale toadstool. Inexperienced mushroom pickers often mistake the
death cap for one of its edible cousins.
</P>
<P>
   To the neophyte, the mushroom hunt means a nice stroll through
the woods, basket in hand, to collect spongy, tasty fungi. But to
high-intensity Russian mushroom hunters like Volkov, this activity
is far more than a pleasant hobby or a cheap way to put something
tasty on the table. Mushroom hunting is silent war _ a quiet,
good-natured, yet fierce competition to see who can collect more
mushrooms and best hide what he or she finds.
</P>
<P>
   When the ruble spun out of control in Moscow and other Russian
cities last month, Russians such as Anna Rasputina, a telemarketer
whose company is nearing bankruptcy because of the economic crisis,
continued to head for the woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always an abundance of mushrooms,'' she said. ``And
they always cost the same: free.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Like their reckless winter brethren, the legions of ice
fishermen who sit on lakes and rivers long after the ice has become
undependable, Russian mushroom hunters seem impervious to the
deadly perils of their hobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe you can be poisoned by a mushroom,'' Volkov
maintained as he thrashed through a thicket of stinging nettles on
a steamy summer's day in the woods near Odrinovo, a farming hamlet
30 miles north of Moscow. Vicious mosquitoes, apparently immune to
American-made repellent, attacked in waves.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who suffer poisoning usually do something wrong, like
picking mushrooms at the side of the road, where they are
contaminated, or preparing them incorrectly,'' Volkov said just
before he broke off his speech with a warrior-like cry.
</P>
<P>
   Bending over, he proudly displayed his find: A pair of large
``beliye griby,'' or white mushrooms _ boletus edulis in the
encyclopedia, the ``Czar of the Forest'' in Russia's rich fungal
folklore. Russians consider this the tastiest cooking mushroom and
also best for freezing, drying, pickling, or marinating for the
long winter months.
</P>
<P>
   ``To find whites so quickly _ this is mushroom bliss,'' Volkov
said with a sigh. ``A mushroom miracle!''
</P>
<P>
   Volkov assiduously avoids the white mushroom's evil twin, known
as the ``satanic mushroom,'' which is not deadly but causes a nasty
stomachache.
</P>
<P>
   Why are mushrooms so popular in Russia? One reason is their
availability. Mushrooms will grow wherever it's cool and damp _ the
typical summer weather forecast for Russia. Even in such forbidding
places as the arctic mining city of Vorkuta, where nothing much
grows except lichen, people gather mushrooms in the tundra in July.
</P>
<P>
   When times are hard, mushrooms brighten up an otherwise drab
diet. Volkov and his wife serve up mushroom-filled pastries, fried
mushrooms with potatoes, mushroom julienne, mushrooms pickled in
brine, and dried mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris N. Yeltsin even bagged a few white mushrooms
during his July vacation in Karelia in northern Russia. In Moscow,
anyone with a car can easily drive to choice mushroom hunting
grounds in the dense forests that surround the city.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Volkov has picked up some tips from the dean of
Russian mushroom hunters, writer Vladimir Soloukhin, whose 1967
work ``Third Hunt'' includes a series of lectures on the subject.
It is not altogether surprising that another Soloukhin work deals
extensively with ice fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever a so-called mushroom rain _ a light summer sun-shower _
falls, Volkov heads for the forest to search for whites, ``little
foxes,'' and ``milk caps.'' The same goes for the mushroom moon _
the first full moon in August. To be certain of the best times,
Volkov consults an astrological calendar.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, the mushroom rains have been frequent, and mushroom
bliss abounds in the forest.
</P>
<P>
   Mushroom good will is another matter. Russian mushroom hunters
take note of their fellow foragers, but only to find the best
spots. When two mushroom hunters meet in the woods, they quickly
cover their baskets so that a competitor cannot glean success and
retrace the other's steps to bountiful areas. Volkov calls this
intelligence gathering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Find anything?'' Volkov inquired of an elderly man who
happened by as Volkov was leaving his newly discovered white
mushroom site. The stranger discreetly zipped his brown leather bag
and smiled politely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope,'' he said, eyeing the wicker basket covered by Volkov's
hand. ``There were some little foxes back aways, but they're all
wormy. You?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Naw,'' Volkov said with a slight grin. ``We didn't find a
thing.''

POP SINGER KEEPS CHRISTAIN MESSAGE IN THE FOREFRONT

   On stage inside packed auditoriums around the country, Rebecca
St. James pauses between songs to talk about the importance of
daily prayer, why Jesus died on the cross and the need to heed
God's biblical lessons. Oh, and one more thing: that she's a virgin
and intends to remain one until she's married out of her faith and
love for God.
</P>
<P>
   Broaching these topics might seem out of place for a ``pop''
singer. But St. James isn't just a rising music star. She's also a
devout Christian whose flourishing career, which began five years
ago at the tender age of 16, is meant to honor Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just love God. He is the center of my life,'' said St. James
in a recent telephone interview from Florida where she was on tour.
``He's my best friend. He's everything to me and he is the only
reason I sing. I really believe if I didn't have God I wouldn't
have any reason to sing. It wasn't my dream to sing on stage. God
is the one who led me into it.''

vocalist on the contemporary Christian music scene, is the daughter
of a Christian music promoter who moved his family from Sydney to
Nashville when St. James was a teenager. She is a big hit among
those in their teens and 20s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe my generation is looking for hope and looking
for answers because they've tried it all _ drugs, alcohol and sex
before marriage and I think they are finding a dead end,'' said St.
James, who got her first big break about five years ago when an
executive with a Christian recording label heard St. James sing in
a church outside Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   She put out her first album, a self-titled recording, in 1994
that made her the youngest artist ever nominated for a Dove Award
as new artist of the year. The awards are contemporary Christian
music's version of the Grammys.
</P>
<P>
   Since then St. James has put out two more albums, ``God'' and
``Christmas,'' garnered many more nominations and awards, including
a Grammy nomination last year, and is about to release a fourth
album, ``Pray,'' next month.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other Christian music stars, the challenge for St.
James is selling records and filling concert halls while making
sure her message isn't lost. Some conservative Christians have
criticized pop Christian musicians for being more interested in
stardom and diluting their message to appeal to a secular audience
than in promoting Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   But St. James said that to be effective popular Christian acts
must make their music relevant _ through lyrics or style of music _
to a younger generation weaned on rock and rap.
</P>
<P>
   St. James also credits her father, mother and six brothers and
sisters, all of whom travel with her on tour, for keeping her
grounded. ``My dads tells me that we're not in show business, we're
in ministry,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Still, St. James is careful about putting her Christian values
at the forefront of every performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want to share with people is the truth that Jesus loves
us and died for all of us and wants us to know that truth,'' St.
James said. ``When they come to the concerts I'm very upfront and
straight that what I'm doing is for God and that I want the show to
be a worshiping experience.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons St. James is so forthright about her
virginity is to underscore the seriousness of her Christian life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of my relationship with God I want to please him and
the Bible talks about purity,'' St. James explains. ``I feel
challenged to be pure in my life, not only in my thoughts and
heart, but in my actions. It certainly would be easier to give in
and have sex.''
</P>
<P>
   St. James has been surprised and pleased at how her promotion of
abstinence has resonated among her fans. ``A lot of teens will come
up to me and thank me for talking about not having sex before
marriage because they say they feel like they're the only ones
making this kind of commitment for their faith,'' she said. ``It's
good for them to know they're not alone. A lot of young people are
standing up for God.''

</P>
<P>
   ``The Church's philosophy of good citizenship encompasses a
spirited community activism to improve neighborhoods and
relationships between neighbors as well as within families. The
Church encourages a healthy mind by encouraging lifelong learning.
... The church also encourages a healthy body through its dietary
guidelines of no alcohol, tobacco or premarital sex. I am grateful
that I have the Church to help me reinforce these wholesome values
with my children.
</P>
<P>
   ``As more families disintegrate under the pressures of modern
society, it is a comfort to be part of a system that has as its
objective my success as an individual. ... We really do take care
of our own. I hope that ... more people listen to the gospel
message, if not to eventually join the Church, to at least
appreciate that Church members are a valuable asset to the
community.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It is the capital's rawest political fight, an
under-the-radar power struggle rife with allegations of Republican
racism and Clinton administration corruption. The Supreme Court
will have to settle it but not before the federal government faces
a possible shutdown over it this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is the 2000 Census.
</P>
<P>
   Strange as it sounds, a decision on how the country gets counted
in 2000 will be one of the key credibility tests for a troubled
President Clinton on Capitol Hill in the coming weeks. Clinton
pledged to House Democrats last month that he would veto any GOP
spending bill this fall that doesn't allow the Census Bureau to
estimate the population it can't actually enumerate in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the president will renege,'' said Representative
Carolyn Maloney, a New Yorker who, like many fellow Democrats from
urban areas, wants the Census Bureau to find better methods for
counting minorities in 2000 than it did in 1990. ``This shouldn't
be political, but right now it is one hot potato.''
</P>
<P>
   The temperature was expected to rise Wednesday (Sept. 9) when
Republicans on the House census subcommittee grilled top officials
of the Commerce Department and Census Bureau on why the Clinton
administration persists in planning for a 2000 Census that includes
statistical ``sampling,'' or estimating, after a federal district
court ruled last month that the method is illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican Congress is opposed to the use of sampling, and
we think the responsible position for the administration is to move
forward without it,'' said Representative Dan Miller, a Florida
Republican who chairs the census subcommittee. ``It's very
frustrating that they want to unilaterally change the way we have
counted people for 200 years for a very high-risk plan that nobody
should trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Acting Census Bureau Director James Holmes said Tuesday that the
2000 Census will be jeopardized if the issue isn't settled by
March. Robert Shapiro, undersecretary of Commerce for economic
affairs, told reporters that without sampling, the projected $4.6
billion census would cost ``substantially more.''
</P>
<P>
   The fuss is more about old-fashioned politics than new math. The
US decennial census, which not only tries to count each of us but
also where we live, determines how the 435 seats in the House will
be divided among the states. No issue is more critical to House
members than whether reapportionment, which follows the census,
will lead to changes in the boundaries and demographics of
districts that have elected them.
</P>
<P>
   Census data also play a big part in the distribution of federal
grant money for everything from highways to Head Start. It amounts
to about $180 billion a year, and legislators care deeply that a
fair share of those dollars come home to their districts.
</P>
<P>
   So do many special-interest groups. Tuesday a coalition of civil
rights activists and advocates for children declared it
``unconscionable'' for politicians to interfere with the planning
of the census. ``They are playing a dangerous game of chicken,''
said Wade Henderson, spokesman for the group and executive director
of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats say they are arguing over how best to
get an accurate census count. According to a bureau analysis, the
1990 enumeration, which cost $2.6 billion, missed some 8 million
people, counted another 4 million twice, and was off by about 10
percent in its US population tally of 246 million. Boston's
population was undercounted by 2.8 percent, the bureau reported.
</P>
<P>
   The error rate, which the bureau said largely results from
undercounting minorities, particularly children, and the rural and
urban poor, was higher in 1990 than it has ever been. Many
statisticians expect even less accuracy in 2000 unless the Census
Bureau supplements its traditional door-to-door and postal count
with a statistical sample that allows it to extrapolate the size
and demographics of the population it misses.
</P>
<P>
   But many Republicans suspect sampling is a Democratic device to
cook the books and increase the count of minorities, particularly
black Americans who overwhelmingly vote Democratic. And some
Democrats just as vehemently accuse Republicans of playing racial
politics by trying to block better census counts that would create
more majority black and Hispanic districts.
</P>
<P>
   GOP officials have estimated that population sampling could
result in redrawing two dozen Republican-held House districts and
losing hundreds of seats in state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Democrats control the model, they will control the
outcome,'' said Peter Cleary, director of the Citizens for an
Honest Count Coalition, a conservative, grass-roots group. ``This
administration's abuses of power are so widespread that there is no
reason to believe it won't be tempted to politicize the census,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans challenged the sampling plan in federal court
and won a significant victory on Aug. 24 when a three-judge panel
agreed that it was illegal under the federal Census Act to base
reapportionment on anything but an actual population enumeration.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich hailed the ruling for exposing ``the
Clinton administration's illegal and unconstitutional scheme to
manipulate our census for the express purposes of political gain.''
Administration officials said they were disappointed by the outcome
but the bureau would continue preparing for a census with sampling.
Last week, the administration appealed the case to the Supreme
Court, hoping for a ruling in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, the only danger of political manipulation comes from
politicians who are interfering in the design of the census and who
directly or indirectly are trying to prevent the bureau from
sampling, which experts conclude is the best way to assure a fair
and accurate count,'' said Shapiro, whose office oversees the
Census Bureau. Shapiro says he expects the Supreme Court to allow
sampling, which would be in line with previous lower court rulings.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they made a deal with Republican
leaders last year to keep the Census 2000 budget intact and allow
sampling studies until the Supreme Court settled the issue. But in
August, the House agreed to fund the bureau for only six months,
prompting the president's threat to veto the $33 billion spending
bill that funds the Commerce, Justice, and State departments and
includes the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Coehlo, a co-chairman and presidential appointee to a
bipartisan US Census Monitoring Board, said Clinton is ``willing to
stand up for what is right'' and will shut down the government when
the fiscal year ends Sept. 30 for the cause of an accurate census.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very bold on the part of Republicans, to say flat out
that they don't want to count certain people, and the reason is
that these people might vote Democratic and turn the House over to
the Democrats,'' said Coehlo, a former Democratic congressman from
California. ``If you are black, Hispanic, Asian, poor, disabled, or
live in a rural area, it's pretty clear the Republicans don't trust
you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Census Monitoring Board's other co-chairman, Republican J.
Kenneth Blackwell, says it is ``unfortunate the race card is being
played by Tony.'' Blackwell, an African-American who is Ohio's
state treasurer, says he opposes sampling and, like other state and
local officials, has better ideas for eliminating the census
undercount, such as improving the Census Bureau's address list and
finding people through administrative documents, like Medicaid
records.
</P>
<P>
   Others have floated the idea of a two-count census: one that
would enumerate for reapportionment, and a second that would count
and sample for allocating federal funds. Civil rights groups are
very cool to two counts, and Shapiro said it would be ``difficult''
to justify.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find the inside-the-Beltway political gamesmanship amusing
some of the time, but mostly disillusioning,'' Blackwell said.
``The overriding need in the 2000 Census is a healthy dose of
transparency and a little less time spent in the search for Oz.''
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau is an unlikely agency to be caught in such a
swirl of controversy. Its professionalism is renowned, its data are
prodigious and widely accepted, and its reputation is as perhaps
the most apolitical agency in the federal bureaucracy. According to
Pat Cantwell, a statistician for the bureau, scientific sampling
not only is very much in the demography mainstream but also has
been used to a small extent in past census counts.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the census's planned combination of enumeration and
estimation _ some 90 percent of the population will be counted, 10
percent would be extrapolated from a survey of households in all
census blocks _ was recommended to the bureau by a blue-ribbon
panel convened by the nonpartisan National Academy of Sciences in
the wake of the 1990 undercount. Economist Charles L. Schultze, who
headed the panel, says delays caused by political fights, not
sampling, are jeopardizing the 2000 Census.
</P>
<P>
   ``The census is the biggest nondefense operation that the
government runs, and by this time it should have its ducks in a
row,'' Schultze said. ``I'm all for sampling, for saving money, and
getting an accurate count, but right now, I think they just better
decide what we're going to do and get moving.''

`WRONGFUL BIRTH' SUITS RAISE FEARS FOR CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; It's at the core of every child's sense of self-worth,
specialists say: The need to feel wanted, to be valued, to be
loved.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; So what will happen, they wondered, to the children in the
middle of the recent wave of ``wrongful birth'' cases _ lawsuits in
which a child's birth is portrayed as an extraordinary burden that
entitles parents to monetary damages?
</P>
<P>
   ``The knowledge of these circumstances of birth that are
embedded in conflict can't help but affect children,'' said Dr.
Carolyn Newberger of the Judge Baker Children's Center in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who's willing to put her child on the legal or
political map is already suspect as to whether they can make it
with that child or not,'' added Dr. T. Berry Brazelton, professor
of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School. ``An attachment to a new
baby should be such a positive, passionate, exciting thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The parents who filed three recent wrongful birth cases are
already the subject of water-cooler debates across New England, as
many parents question whether any monetary gain is worth the
emotional toll a suit may exact on the child.
</P>
<P>
   The recent lawsuits include:
</P>
<P>
   _A suit by a Maine couple who argued that their doctor's
inability to perform an amniocentesis resulted in an infant with
Down syndrome that they would have preferred to abort. A federal
jury found for the doctor in April.
</P>
<P>
   _A claim filed in August against a Boston fertility clinic by a
Wayland, Mass. firefighter who said the clinic impregnated his
estranged wife without his permission, using frozen embryos
fertilized with his sperm. Now, Richard Gladu says, the additional
child-support payments have become unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   _A case against a Brookline, Mass. clinic by a woman who was
awaiting an abortion on Dec. 30, 1994, when John Salvi III went on
a murderous rampage. Deborah Gaines fled Preterm Health Services in
terror, never to return, and gave birth to her fourth child,
Vivian, seven months later.
</P>
<P>
   Gaines's lawyer, Chris Milne, said Massachusetts case law
solidly backs his client's claim that, because of Preterm's
allegedly inadequate security, she is entitled to receive damages
for the ``extraordinary care'' that she will have to provide for a
child he says is learning-disabled and hyperactive.
</P>
<P>
   Because the abortion was sought for economic reasons, Milne
said, a lawsuit for economic compensation is a logical move with
ample precedent in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When for economic reasons, a mother was trying to terminate a
pregnancy, and, because of negligence of another, that doesn't
happen, she can recover for, among other things, the extraordinary
costs of caring for that child,'' Milne said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not claiming anywhere that it's wrong that a child was
born,'' Milne said. Describing the case as ``wrongful cost,'' he
said, ``is much better than `wrongful birth.'''
</P>
<P>
   However, the attorney who represented the Maine couple in the
suit against the doctor over his inability to perform an
amniocentesis bridled at the thought of Gaines's lawsuit over her
failure to get an abortion after Salvi's rampage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a hard time with this,'' said Daniel Perry, of Bangor,
``because she clearly could have gone somewhere else. For one
thing, she wasn't shot. And for another, she wasn't on the last day
of a window to have a legal abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe strongly in the claim of wrongful birth,'' Perry
said. ``But with the factors in this case, I don't think this
particular woman has a real strong claim.''
</P>
<P>
   Milne counters that the factors in this case are not widely
known, and that the public is having an ``understandable reaction''
to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Gaines, who was on welfare, already had three children when she
decided to have the abortion. If finances were a problem then, they
are an even more difficult one now, Milne said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer said Gaines suffered post-traumatic stress after
Salvi's attack that was noted by health workers treating her in the
weeks and months after the assault.
</P>
<P>
   Milne said he offered to settle with Preterm solely on the
post-traumatic stress issue. When the company refused, Milne said,
he had no alternative but to bring the case to trial and also
request compensation for Vivian's continued care.
</P>
<P>
   Preterm has denied responsibility for Salvi's attack, saying no
reasonable security measures could have deterred someone like
Salvi.
</P>
<P>
   Legal issues aside, the prospect that a child may learn that he
or she was scheduled for abortion is profoundly troubling to many.
For some, no lawsuit is worth the psychological hurt that may
result from this largely uncharted area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really hard to predict with any sense of certainty, but
one would be concerned that the implications for the children are
going to be problematic,'' said Newberger, a psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alexandra Rolde, a child psychiatrist, said that when she
heard the news of Gaines's suit, she thought: ``The poor child,
she's going to feel unwanted and rejected.''
</P>
<P>
   Milne, however, says Gaines loves Vivian, and is only trying to
provide her with better medical and educational resources, toward
which all damages would be applied.
</P>
<P>
   But despite what he feels is solid legal ground, Milne said he
realizes the task ahead is daunting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear the word `welfare,' you hear the words `unwed
mother,' but that has nothing to do with this case,'' Milne said.
``She's a human being who's exercising her legal right.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   GLOUCESTER, Mass. _ A trim gray sedan is purring outside as
painter Theresa Bernstein prepares to head into the night to give a
lecture on her favorite topics _ art and herself.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that she is 108 and can see out of only one eye and
hear out of a single ear. That she has had four strokes and four
cataract operations and broken both hips. A salt-kissed summer
breeze is tickling the old white house where she has summered since
1924 and there's that newspaper photographer down there at the
bottom of the wheelchair ramp, his lens trained on the front door.
Bernstein tucks her tiny silver topknot under her straw bowler and
waves freshly painted scarlet nails at an aide. The press is
waiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would someone please take off my goddamned glasses!'' she
commands.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Bernstein ever particularly repressed her emotions.
This is a woman who as a teenager swept her canvases with colors so
dramatic that even curmudgeonly critics took note; who plied her
brush with such force and confidence in the 1920s that many mistook
her work for that of a man; who, astoundingly enough, painted women
as substantive people rather than accouterments to men; who devoted
herself with such passion to her husband, painter and master etcher
William Meyerowitz, that her own art fell into near obscurity; and
who believed in nothing so much as ``spontaneous expression,'' in
both her art and her life.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a long and largely happy life. But it has taken
until now, with Bernstein well into her second century, for her to
receive the kind of acclaim that many believe she has long
deserved. Earlier this year, a New York gallery featured a 70-year
retrospective of her work while another exhibit in which she is a
principal is on a two-year tour of the country. Since she turned
100, she has been the subject of several other shows as well.
</P>
<P>
   Why this flurry of attention now, as she approaches the midnight
of her life? Part of the reason is that increasing numbers of women
critics and dealers have drawn attention to women artists once
ignored. Part of it is that her vivid realism and attention to
working-class people doing unexceptional things like going to
church and to work and to the beach and the theater are again in
vogue. And part of it is that she is astonishingly old.
</P>
<P>
   How she has achieved her stunning longevity she will not say. It
is true that she neither drank nor smoked. Her only other nod to
good health was ``to get enough air and exercise to live.'' In
fact, some speculate that she is even older than the generally
accepted 1890 birth date would make her, including a few neighbors
who remember her admitting to being older in earlier years. So how
old is she really?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm old enough to keep it to myself,'' Bernstein declares.
</P>
<P>
   However old she is, Bernstein has continued to work hard. Later
this year, her sixth book, a collection of drawings and stories for
children called ``Rabbitville,'' will be published. She is working
on a seventh book, about Theodor Herzl, founder of the Zionist
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she continues to paint, propped up in her hospital
bed or seated in her wheelchair in the summer afternoon, an orange
blanket tucked around her lap by one of the nurses or friends who
are in constant attendance. The long table beside her bed is strewn
with half-used tubes of oils and uncapped markers. There're a
couple of portraits vaguely in progress, sheets etched raggedly in
her beloved browns and oranges. There are four tiny vases of
fresh-cut flowers and a pair of alabaster horses. But the better
subject matter by far, of course, is the century and more of
memories that drift through her mind like gossamer dust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darling,'' she observed to a visitor on a recent afternoon,
``my life has been much more exciting than you could imagine.'' And
then she fell asleep.

<P>
   Joan Whalen wished she had met Bernstein before the artist died.
Owner of the Joan Whalen Fine Art gallery, Whalen had long been an
admirer of Bernstein's paintings when last year one of her works
wound up for sale in Whalen's gallery on consignment. Whalen got on
the phone to get a death date for the artist, only to learn that
Bernstein was not dead at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked. Delighted, but shocked,'' exclaims Whalen. ``I
had always thought she was an exceptional painter, one who never
fell into the isms of this century. She did her own thing, and I
always respected her for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Whalen hung a 70-year retrospective of
Bernstein's work in her gallery, part of a broader resurgence of
interest in the artist's paintings. Often described as an urban
realist, Bernstein is also featured in a two-year traveling exhibit
called ``The Philadelphia Ten: A Women's Artist Group 1917-1945.''
Over the past decade, Bernstein has had exhibits at the
Philadelphia Museum of Judaica, the Museum of the City of New York,
and others.
</P>
<P>
   That her work has long been shown in New York is a reflection of
her deep connection to that city, where she has lived in the same
studio on West 74th Street since 1932. Many of her most popular
paintings are vivid portrayals of Manhattan life in the 1920s and
teens, such as ``Waiting Room _ Employment Office'' (1917), in
which half a dozen women anxiously await work, or ``Searchlights on
the Hudson'' (1915), depicting several women and children playing
in the shadows of lights from gunboats patrolling the river, or
``Armistice Day'' (1918). The many beaches and vistas of
Gloucester, where Bernstein lives from July through September, also
figure prominently in her work. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ashcan School alum
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time her work has been hailed. A
Philadelphia native, Bernstein studied at the Philadelphia School
of Design for Women and the Art Students League in New York before
she became one of the youngest of the urban realist painters known
as the Ashcan School who dominated the art scene in the early part
of this century.
</P>
<P>
   ``She really tried to push the boundaries of American
traditionalism in her work,'' says Susan Fisher Sterling, chief
curator of the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington,
D.C. ``She painted scenes we all know, like beaches and the streets
of New York, but they were powerful. They had socko.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many of her male colleagues, Bernstein worked with bold,
forceful strokes, her paint thick as frosting. People were her
subject. People in line and on the subway and reading in the
library and watching parades or the crashing of the waves. She used
browns and yellows rather than more feminine pastels. Painting
under the name T. Bernstein in order to escape the discrimination
other women painters suffered, she drew admiring reviews for her
work and in 1919 had her first solo show in New York. And then one
day, three male members of the National Academy of Design showed up
at her door.

PUTTING SAN FRANCISCO TO THE TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If you wrote the following socio-math test for
San Francisco students, please contact me. I got it by Web virtual
tradition _ from a friend who got it from a friend who got it from
a friend. I'd like to give credit where credit is due, and please
don't try to tell me Kurt Vonnegut or Mike Barnicle made up these
questions.
</P>
<P>
   These are just three of 11 San Francisco socio-math questions I
received:
</P>
<P>
   1. The City and County of San Francisco decides to destroy 50
rats infesting downtown. If 9,800 animal rights activists hold a
candlelight vigil, how many people did each rat empower?
</P>
<P>
   2. Michael has two abusive stepfathers and an alcoholic mother.
If his self-esteem is reduced by 20 percent per dysfunctional
parent, but Michael feels 3 percent better for each person he
denigrates, how long will it take before he's ready to go home if 1
person walks by the cafe every 2 minutes?
</P>
<P>
   3. There are 4,500 homes in Mill Valley, and all of them recycle
plastic. If each household recycles 10 soda bottles a day and buys
one polar fleece pullover per month, does Mill Valley have a
monthly plastic surplus or deficit?
</P>
<P>
   Look, I'm not saying this is the funniest stuff in the world,
but it's funnier than most stuff on the World Wide Web. Better
still, it's printable.
</P>
<P>
   Of the other questions on the San Francisco socio-math test, I
also liked the one for advanced placement students:
</P>
<P>
   4. Katie, Trip, Ling, John-John and Effie share a three-bedroom
apartment on Guerrero for $2,400 a month. Effie and Trip can share
one bedroom, but the other three need their own rooms with separate
ISDN lines to run their Web servers. None of them wants to use the
futon in the living room as a bed, and they each want to save $650
in three months to attend Burning Man.
</P>
<P>
   What is their best option?
</P>
<P>
   a. All five roommates accept a $12/hour job-share as handgun
monitors at Mission High.
</P>
<P>
   b. Ask Miles, the bisexual auto mechanic, to share Effie and
Trip's bedroom for $500 a month.
</P>
<P>
   c. Petition the Board of Supervisors to advance Ling her annual
digital-artists-of-color stipend.
</P>
<P>
   d. Rent strike.
</P>
<P>
   No humor is entirely new, and we've all seen math tests that are
jokes made at the expense of various minority groups. Curiously,
those racist joke math tests are descendants of an IQ test
developed 30 years ago to be culturally biased in favor of blacks _
not a joke, but a serious critique of the Anglo-Saxon cultural bias
of IQ tests.
</P>
<P>
   The best jokes based on verbal math problems are on the absurd
side. If I remember right, Tom Robbins had a verbal problem in
``Even Cowgirls Get the Blues'' that went: ``If a hen and a half
lays an egg and a half in a day and a half, how long will it take a
monkey with a wooden leg to kick all the seeds out of a dill
pickle?''
</P>
<P>
   I like silly jokes like that. Anyway, it's nice to see Web humor
that isn't mean, sexist or racist, but lampoons what we loosely
call San Francisco culture.
</P>
<P>
   I'll try to flunk myself with my own joke test:
</P>
<P>
   1. A low-paid half-time member of the San Francisco demimonde
drinks a half-caff, low-foam, low-fat latte twice a day. How many
half-witted adjectives does he use to describe himself in a Bay
Guardian singles ad?
</P>
<P>
   2. If Tiffany drives from Corte Madera to the Financial District
in a BMW capable of doing zero to 60 in 11 seconds, how many calls
can she make to her broker per red light run while she puts on her
eyeliner?
</P>
<P>
   3. An N-Judah train runs for three blocks after the driver gets
off. No one is hurt. No lawyers are called. What lessons in
probability theory does this teach us?
</P>
<P>
   a. The glass is half full, and we're all about to win the
lottery.
</P>
<P>
   b) There was no one in the station when that tree fell.
</P>
<P>
   4. The mayor promised to fix Muni in 100 days 1,000 days ago. If
all the sphygmomanometers at the University of California at San
Francisco are on loan to Bill Clinton's spin doctors, how long
before Mayor Willie Brown has as many voters as ex-girlfriends?
</P>
<P>
   5. If Mark McGwire was still playing for the Oakland A's this
season, what number home run would he have hit Tuesday night, and
how many people would have been in the stands to catch it? Factor
in Drew Soicher.
</P>
<P>
   6. The San Francisco Chronicle spends an entire week filling up
its Datebook section with critics' self-criticism. Calculate the
drop in Chronicle circulation as a function of the Little Man
standing on a chair clapping for himself with his pants down.
</P>
<P>
   7. Warren Hinckle describes another columnist as ``neurotic''
for attacking the mayor's Treasure Island policies. Given that
Hinckle did not use the stronger words ``psychotic'' or ``barking
mad,'' determine how much more he wants to be paid for his
flackery. Express in dollars or shots of Bushmills.
</P>
<P>
   8. One San Francisco columnist takes four good jokes from the
Web. He then adds eight of his own half-bad jokes. Summarize his
column mathematically, using the Barnicle-Carlin Originality
Coefficient and the Vonnegut-Schmich Shadow Effect. Disregard the
Dave Barry Mr. Language Person Theorem.
</P>
<P>
   Extra points if you can work in Jon Carroll's cat.

   The People ``Best and Worst Dressed'' double issue is like
Saturday morning cartoons for adults. The fabrics and colors are
candy for the eyes, the hairstyles are hyperreal and unruffleable,
the faces have shapes simply not found in nature. Personally, I
prefer that sad gang of worst-dressed celebrities, their bold
decisions and confused identities tinged with pathos in the
unflattering white light of the papparazzi's cameras. Unaware of
the hugeness of their botches, the worst dressed graciously stand
and smile, granting a moment to the world, perhaps a sincere little
bellybutton peeking eagerly out from a glittery pants suit.
Meanwhile, some photographer has disgrace and Mr. Blackwell in his
heart.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, ``best'' men Harry Connick Jr. and Greg Kinnear are
``conservative and groovy'' and ``not too groovy and not too
slobby,'' respectively, according to the tasteful window dresser
Simon Doonan. But, ``worst'' entertainers Ethan Hawke and Billy Bob
Thornton are far more entertaining in their seedy, undignified,
ill-fitting, ungroovy duds. Signourney Weaver reaches Cher-like
proportions with her misguided frocks, and Carmen Electra has an
almost ``Josie and the Pussycats'' charm in her pink bell bottoms
and Elvis shades. She's as groovy as groovy can be. And Alex
Kingston's Heidi-styled-Euro-peasant-meets-trippy-cool-kid look is
memorable, and downright stunning.

<P>
   Have faith, there actually is a table of contents in the
September Harper's Bazaar. It's about a quarter pound into the
556-page issue, which is overflowing with expensive images of next
year's best and worst dresses. The ads and photo spreads are, of
course, exquisitely done, with mystique-minded models enough to
fill a town called Stepford.
</P>
<P>
   Calista Flockhart is the cover girl, and in her profile (on page
502) there's lots of post-feminist querying about her TV character,
Ally McBeal: ``We are women who are told, `You can have it all! You
can have a career; you can have a husband; you can have a child!'
And suddenly, now, if you don't do all of that, you're a failure,''
she says. But it's the first-person account of the dating world by
Fran Drescher that wins the bizarre prize. It's a boldly
neanderthal look at men, who are either afraid of commitment or
elusive, with Drescher getting dumped and re-dumped by a low-budget
independent film producer named Dick. Supposedly the guy is a snake
for giving her very mixed signals and asking her how old she is _
except that she keeps going back for more. In one sentence, she
says, ``Just as I was beginning to feel like returned merchandise
from a Macy's half-off sale, my ego reminded me that I am a
beautiful, successful celebrity, and with that I turned and walked
away.'' In the next sentence, she's asking him, ``How about
Monday?''

<P>
   In the New York Review of Books for Sept. 24, Louis Menand goes
out on a limb about ``Saving Private Ryan,'' which was greeted with
nearly universal acclaim this summer. By pointing out a few common
mis-perceptions of the World War II picture, Menand gets at what
has been missing from Steven Spielberg's serious historical movies:
ambiguity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan'' has been received as an unconventional
take on the pre-Vietnam battle genre, a movie that undermines the
sentimentality and patriotism that has softened most World War II
movies to get at hard moral questions. Certainly, the fight
sequences are filmed with Spielberg's trademark bravura _ ``his
shots have an unusual visual and aural clarity, almost a
hyperclarity _ like life, but with better lighting,'' Menand
writes. But while the Americans die tragically (and because the
Americans die tragically), the Germans are felled without much
sorrow. Spielberg is doing what most Hollywood war movies have
done: ``Good men kill bad men, to our applause, and die, to our
sorrow, for a just cause.'' Instead of challenging audiences, he
provides us with familiar, easy, emotional responses. ``It is as
though he believed that if he let the hook sip out of our mouth
even for a minute, we might get the wrong idea about Nazis or
slavery,'' Menand writes.

A BIG QUESTION STILL CONFRONTS THE PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOOTBALL HADES, Colo. _ So why do they keep losing these games?
</P>
<P>
   That question, more than any other, is on the minds of Patriots
fans this morning, and if they are honest with themselves, it has
to be on the minds of the Patriots as well.
</P>
<P>
   Why do they keep losing these games?
</P>
<P>
   Not simply the games against the Denver Broncos, to whom they
have now lost 11 straight, but the so-called ``Big Games.'' Why do
they seem to lose to Green Bay and Denver and Pittsburgh and San
Francisco and the few other elite teams in the NFL when it counts
the most?
</P>
<P>
   The term ``big game'' has become one of the most overused and
least understood in pro sports today. Every game is a big game if
you don't win it, and you get to a Big Game only by winning other
big games that don't seem as big after the fact only because they
led to a bigger one in which you didn't prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, the Patriots' Super Bowl run of 1996. They
lost the ``Big Game'' when the Packers beat them, but did they not
win ``big games'' to get to the ``Big Game''? Of course they did.
Yet there has long been a feeling of unease about how this
particular team performs against top competition, and nothing that
happened Monday night in the 27-21 season-opening loss at Denver
lessened those worries.
</P>
<P>
   As quarterback Drew Bledsoe so aptly put it this summer, you are
not an elite team until you beat the elite teams. Until then, as
Bledsoe pointed out, you remain a second-tier team whether you like
it or not, and no amount of sycophants hanging on your shoulder or
picking up your dry cleaning while telling you differently will
change that.
</P>
<P>
   Only the players can change it, and as yet, they haven't been
able to. But why has that been the case with a team seemingly as
talented as these young Patriots are, and why did it remain so
Monday night in a game in which New England achieved its main
objective, to shut down Terrell Davis and the dangerous Denver
running game?
</P>
<P>
   In a complex game, the answers are often not simple, but in this
case, they seem to be. In the biggest of games, the Patriots'
biggest stars have seldom shined brightly enough. They have not
done enough often enough, and until they do, outcomes like Monday
night's will continue.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe did his part, playing well despite being under pressure.
He was sacked three times at key moments. But he also was 20 of 32
for 289 yards and two touchdowns without throwing an interception
in the face of that pressure (although he did have several
completions on throws when it seemed the word ``unwise'' would have
to apply). And he got better as the game wore on.
</P>
<P>
   But when your biggest plays come from Troy Brown and Shawn
Jefferson on offense and from no one on a defense that boasts two
$5 million-a-year players and a third earning $2.5 million, you are
not going to beat the elite teams very often. It is the elite
players who have to lift their teammates, not the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Denver won Monday night even though Davis was stopped
cold (22 carries, 75 yards). The Broncos won because their
defensive cocaptain and the elite of their elite, quarterback John
Elway, refused to let them lose.
</P>
<P>
   In games where the best are facing the near best, the very best
players must do more than their job to win, because it is too
difficult for the others to do theirs, even though Brown's
performances consistently argue the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, one or more of your best players must exceed himself,
as Kordell Stewart did on that infamous touchdown run in New
England's playoff loss last season, to overcome an equally talented
opponent. They must make plays when others cannot. That the Patriot
elite have seldom done.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, Willie McGinest. On Sunday against the
Indianapolis Colts, he's likely to have three sacks and be the most
dominating player on the field. But what happened in Denver? In
Denver, he had as many penalties as tackles (three of each) and
made no sacks. He jumped offside on a fourth-and-3 Bronco punt that
gave Denver a first down at New England's 38, and three straight
Elway completions later, Davis was running for a 9-yard touchdown
that made it 17-0 in the second quarter. Later he would be flagged
for roughing the passer, which turned a 9-yard completion into a
19-yarder that gave Denver the ball on the New England 11 and set
up its winning scoring.
</P>
<P>
   After that penalty, McGinest was benched, according to coach
Pete Carroll, because ``he had had enough mistakes by then.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrast that with the play of Denver defensive cocaptain Bill
Romanowski. Romanowski is nowhere near as physically gifted as
McGinest, yet he produced two sacks in critical moments. He nearly
caught Bledsoe for a safety in the first quarter to give Elway the
field position that set up Denver's initial touchdown. Then he
sacked Bledsoe for a 14-yard loss on the first play of the fourth
quarter on a third and 6, forcing a punt that gave Denver the ball
on the New England 43. When that field position was coupled with
McGinest's roughing penalty four plays later, it was 7 more points
and a 27-14 lead that was the true measure of the distance that
still exists between these teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got in the huddle and I'm saying, `Somehow, some way, we've
got to make a big play,' and then all of a sudden, I was the guy
who had to make it,'' said Romanowski of his second sack, which
came off a blitz designed to free him. ``It's one of those things
that when you get the chance to make some plays, you've got to make
them.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the essence of winning big games. Given the chance, the
biggest players must make the big plays in the Big Games or you
lose.
</P>
<P>
   The same applies to elite units. If a team says its strength is
its defense, as the Patriots have contended all summer, then it
can't let a top opponent score three of the first four times it has
the ball, as Denver did, because if that happens, folks, you don't
have an elite defense anymore.
</P>
<P>
   What you have is a 17-0 deficit and a large problem to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Until the best of their best step forward in such situations,
those problems will continue in such games and the Patriots will
continue to chase the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Their own wind.

   TAKE-ART-BOS  
 GLOUCESTER, Mass.: ... at her door.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``They stood at the door and they said, `We like your father's
work very much,''' recalls Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Oh, he'll be pleased to hear that.'
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `We'd like him to join the Salmagundi Club.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Oh, he'll be pleased to hear that.'''
</P>
<P>
   They were, of course, referring to her work. But the acclaim did
not last much beyond the 1920s. In the following decade,
Bernstein's style became less monumental, her technique airier, and
palette lighter at the same time that interest in American realism
began to decline. Equally important was her relationship to
Meyerowitz, whom she married in 1919. Bernstein, by virtually any
assessment, deeply loved her husband, as he did her, and she
devoted much of her energy toward promoting his work, particularly
the color etchings for which he became famous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think over the years she decided she would take a back seat
and promote his work and that is what happened,'' says Girard
Jackson, a friend of the couple's who has established an extensive
public collection of Bernstein's work in Sugar Land, Texas. ``There
was only a single painting of hers in their studio until he died.
She just fell by the wayside as far as the public was concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   But she continued to paint. Often the couple painted side by
side in their small Gloucester studio or in the lush garden out
back. When they finished, they would celebrate with friends over
Manischewitz and a special chickpea appetizer. Whoever the guests,
``it was Theresa who dominated. She was the star whether they were
at your place or theirs,'' recalls neighbor Jackie Bell. ``Bill was
the perfect foil. He didn't mind at all.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Losses and recovery
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not all was sublime. Shortly after they were married, Bernstein
gave birth to a girl and named her Isadora. The baby died of
pneumonia two months later. In her biography of her husband called
``The Artist Speaks,'' Bernstein wrote, ``I remember the sunny
morning when they carried her away and the crib was dismantled.''
Bernstein, who was apparently unable to have more children, will
not talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of her husband in 1981 was also a stunning blow, but
Bernstein persevered with characteristic determination. For days
she sat alone in their studio wondering what to do. ``I said to the
furniture, `Who's going to write the book?' Bernstein caws in mock
distress. ``The furniture crackled and rattled and said, `We don't
write. We've been supporting you for years.' I said again to the
furniture, `Who's going to write the book?' The furniture crackled
again and said, `There's nobody to write the book but you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein toiled over her husband's biography for nearly four
years in Gloucester, dictating through the summer afternoons. The
house, graced by green shutters and a leafy arbor out front, is a
monument to their life together. Paintings cover virtually every
inch of wall space, including the empty bedrooms upstairs in which
Bernstein has not set foot for nearly a decade. In the old studio
downstairs, unfinished canvases lean against the wall as though
their creators had just stepped away. In the next room, Bernstein
peels back a rug to show a dramatic green and black abstract she
and her husband painted on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no money for a rug,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   One day in 1984, Bernstein asked Jackson to go into her
Gloucester attic and see what was there. What he found was an
artistic trove worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. There were
canvases on the floor, canvases on the furniture, stacks of
canvases, nearly 400 in all. Many of them Bernstein had painted in
her 20s and they are considered her finest work, such as
``Searchlights on the Hudson,'' which recently sold for about
$50,000. Later that same year the New York Historical Society
featured an exhibit of Bernstein's and Meyerowitz's work and
Bernstein embarked on a new chapter in her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a new adventure for her,'' says Jackson. ``She was
totally devoted to William and his work when he was alive and then
she turned the page and went on. After he died she just decided to
live for herself, which she has done.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Relentless saleswoman
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few years, scores of paintings were carried out of
Bernstein's homes, restored and hung in museums and galleries along
the East Coast, including several in Boston. As the price of her
work soared to as much as $100,000, Bernstein's legendary sales
skills grew razor sharp. Compromise is not a word she particularly
likes. Whalen, the dealer who featured a retrospective of
Bernstein's work this spring, remembers meeting Bernstein for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `You're kind of young. Do you know how to sell my
art?''' recalls Whalen. ``I said, `I think I do.' And she said,
`Let me tell you, when people come into your gallery I want you to
lock the door and don't let anybody leave until there is a check on
the table. That is how you sell my art.' I thought she was kidding.
But I learned that's exactly how she did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Few are excused from her sales pitch. Many Gloucester residents
regularly receive notices in the mail from Bernstein urging them to
buy her latest book or reconsider an old one. One resident told of
how after she decided not to buy a Meyerowitz etching because it
was too expensive, Bernstein called her several weeks later to say
that the price had increased.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon, Bernstein watched intently as a reporter
leafed hastily through a display of her books _ including the
Meyerowitz biography, two personal journals, a collection of her
sketches and another of her poetry _ and noted, ``You have no
concentration.'' She refuses to loan her books, saying, ``No one
brings them back. You have to buy them.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been a busy summer. Bernstein has attended several local
dinner and events _ a complex undertaking that requires several
people to lift her in and out of the car. But few will forget her
annual appearance at the North Shore Arts Association in Gloucester
last month.
</P>
<P>
   Billed to address the topic of ``Art Versus Art Per Se,''
Bernstein had prepared for the event for weeks, mouthing the words
of her speech as she lay in bed. But seated before scores of
listeners in her wheelchair, a cluster of pink roses pinned to her
shirt, Bernstein dealt handily with her topic, dismissed abstract
art as ``machinery,'' and deftly dodged questions about her
favorite artists. She then launched into some of her favorite
stories, told a riotous tale of a mouse in World War II, another
about falling off the toilet and seized the opportunity to plug her
books. In the end it came down to this:
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say one thing,'' she said. ``I've always enjoyed
life. I always felt life had so much to offer and you just have to
find the so much you can use in your own life.''
</P>
<P>
   And with that, she adjusted her straw hat and wheeled into the
summer night air.

PARKER'S FRESH FORMULA FOR `TROUBLE IN PARADISE'  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
TROUBLE IN PARADISE 
By Robert B. Parker 
Putnam, 336 pp., $22.95 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jesse Stone doesn't know what's going down out there on Stiles
Island, an exclusive residential enclave off Boston's North Shore.
On the other hand, James Macklin, an ex-con who is planning ``the
mother of all stick-ups,'' doesn't know who he's dealing with,
though he does remark after meeting Jesse, ``He's not what I wanted
him to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Jesse is, however, what readers of Robert B. Parker really do
want him to be. ``Trouble in Paradise'' continues a series begun in
``Night Passage,'' and Jesse Stone, a reforming alcoholic policeman
who's left LA for Paradise, Mass., is the series's Spenser _
younger, randier, less literate, but just as smart, just as tough,
and able to walk a straight moral line through a zigzag society.
Like Spenser, too, he's an ex-athlete, a baseball player who lost
his career in a double-play accident; he talks to a framed photo of
Ozzie Smith. Jesse thinks about drinks the way Spenser thinks about
food.
</P>
<P>
   (Parker, who has a ways to go before he's as industrious and
prolific as Agatha Christie, apparently wants to shift into high
gear; he's reportedly planning to launch a third series, featuring
a savvy feminist gumshoe. She'll probably be more like Spenser than
like Miss Marple.)
</P>
<P>
   In some ways the Stone series will be reassuring to the people
who have read the more than two dozen Spenser books that Parker has
written over the years. Many things are the same _ the momentum,
the sense of place and time, the tough-guy dialogue that women
speak with equal ease, the sharp social commentary, the
psychological penetration, the compassion for those to whom life
has dealt a bad hand, the anger at people who mistreat others,
particularly those who mess up children, and the delight in
sexuality, which in the Stone books doesn't stop at speculation.
Major characters in the Spenser books, like Sergeant Belson and
Rita Fiore, have walk-ons here.
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, ``Trouble in Paradise'' is technically
familiar. Parker again proceeds with an incident-per-chapter form
as rigorous as a Spenserian stanza. But he is also pushing the
envelope a little, something he hasn't dared to do in years _ since
an unhappy mid-career attempt to relocate Spenser out of Boston and
turn him into James Bond. In this series he's abandoned Spenser's
first-person narrative and the single point of view. This enables
Parker to tell us things Jesse doesn't know, and to create suspense
in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   Much of ``Trouble in Paradise'' unfolds in chapters that
alternate between the development of Macklin's scheme and Jesse's
personal and small-town professional dilemmas; the lines of the
plot converge to create the climax. Macklin's project is not just
to rob a bank but to take the entire island. We see him working it
all out with his loyal girlfriend, Faye, recruiting his team of
experts, teasing and testing Jesse, then putting the plan into
action. This sounds a little like a formula caper movie, but it's a
fresh formula for Parker, and it's interesting to watch it
intersect with the rather different formula for a police procedural
(which is itself intersecting with Parker's hard-boiled-private-eye
formula). Also, Parker finds psychological complexities in
Macklin's character that go beyond what you'd expect, and Faye,
too, isn't merely a good-hearted moll.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jesse is white-knuckling his drinking; he may try to
stick to two, but he's not going to turn down any sexual
opportunity. His ex-wife, Jenn, the aspiring actress who turned up
at the end of ``Night Passage'' has decided to stay on, although
not necessarily or exclusively with him _ she's become a TV
meteorologist, which gives Parker an opportunity to comment on the
absurdities of some of our broadcast journalism. (``It's not really
about telling people the weather,'' Jenn remarks. ``It's about
marketing the weather person as a way to market the station.'')
Jesse may even be guilty of stalking her; unlike Spenser, he's not
a wholly attractive character. The luscious, woozy, and lonely
lawyer Abby Taylor is still available, and so is a platinum-blonde
real estate agent named Marcy Campbell whose simple black dress
``seemed to whisper engagingly over her body when she moved.''
</P>
<P>
   Paradise seems to be a pretty sleepy place, even if the previous
book had a dangerous private militia in it. This one opens with
arson _ three troubled teenagers have vandalized and then burned
down the home of a gay couple, and Jesse is not going to let them
get away with it _ and ends with cinematic explosions and duels to
the death. But it's what comes in between that counts. Robert B.
Parker is loaded for bear this time _ or, as Spenser might have put
it, he's loaded every rift with ore.

OF GERSHWIN WE SING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Dec. 8, 1931, at the Majestic Theatre in Boston, ``Of Thee I
Sing,'' made its debut and made entertainment history. Based on a
love triangle involving a US president, it swept Broadway, becoming
the first musical comedy published in book form (by Alfred A.
Knopf) and the first awarded the Pulitzer Prize for drama.
</P>
<P>
   The prize was shared by the writers, George S. Kaufman and
Morrie Ryskind, and the librettist, Ira Gershwin (``Who cares what
banks fail in Yonkers/ Long as you've got a kiss that conquers?'')
The panel ignored the composer, Ira's brother, one of the few times
George Gershwin was ever overlooked by anyone.
</P>
<P>
   The son of Morris and Rose Gershovitz (later Gershvin, then
Gershwin), was born in Brooklyn on Sept. 26, 1898. A century later,
a month-long festival confirms his status as an American genius in
both popular and symphonic music. Art and envy are often roommates.
Some critics sniff at Gershwin's concertos and rhapsodies,
preferring atonal composers whose works sound like kitchen
appliances wearing out.
</P>
<P>
   Gershwin savored the noises he heard and transformed them. From
Paris, he took home a Renault taxi horn, which echoed in his
orchestral suite, ``An American in Paris.'' His most famous work,
``Rhapsody in Blue,'' now advertises an airline, but took shape
aboard the New Haven Railroad. Before the opening of a musical at
Boston's Shubert Theatre in December 1923, the rhapsody rode the
rails and almost wrote itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this stage of the piece, I was summoned to Boston for the
premiere of `Sweet Little Devil.' I had already done some work on
the rhapsody. It was on the train, with its steely rhythms, its
rattl-ty bang that is often so stimulating to a composer,''
Gershwin later recalled, ``that I suddenly heard _ and even saw on
paper _ the complete construction of the rhapsody, from beginning
to end.
</P>
<P>
   ``No new themes came to me, but I worked on the thematic
material already in mind and tried to conceive the composition as a
whole. I heard it as a sort of musical kaleidoscope of America _ of
our vast melting pot, of our unduplicated national pep, of our
blues, our metropolitan madness. By the time I reached Boston I had
a definite plot of the piece, as distinguished from its actual
substance.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1920s, streamlined and frenetic, was an American decade, the
first that freed art and music from European influences. George
Gershwin symbolized the '20s as much as Babe Ruth or H.L. Mencken.
</P>
<P>
   Gershwin began his musical career in Tin Pan Alley, as a teenage
human jukebox, a song plugger, playing sheet music for customers.
In 1919, at 21, he wrote a hit for Al Jolson, ``Swanee,'' about a
river he had never seen. As his hit songs began to flow, he also
won fame in concert halls. ``Rhapsody in Blue'' was first performed
at New York's Aeolian Hall in 1924, ``Concerto in F'' at Carnegie
Hall in 1925, and his ``Second Rhapsody'' premiered at Symphony
Hall in 1932, with Serge Koussevitsky conducting the Boston
Symphony Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Gershwin never married and never came close, dating many
actresses and models. Like many geniuses, he did not believe in
false modesty. His friend Oscar Levant said, ``Tell me, George, if
you had it to do all over again, would you still fall in love with
yourself?''
</P>
<P>
   A brain tumor took his life in 1937, when he was 39. Who knows
how many rousing concertos or tender love songs he could have
written? Gershwin tunes celebrated a wide-eyed romantic love, far
more optimistic than the bittersweet songs of Cole Porter or
Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart.
</P>
<P>
   George and Ira did for love what Orville and Wilbur Wright did
for aviation. To the most rap-hardened ears, the Gerswhin legacy
still evokes love. For ``Of Thee I Sing,'' they wrote ``Love Is
Sweeping the Country,'' an anthem as American as waves hugging the
shore. For George Gershwin on his 100th, ``All the sexes from Maine
to Texas/ Have never known such love before.''

NOW MAY NOT BE SOON ENOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN McNAMARA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It took the National Organization of Women so long to get off
the dime, it might be too late to turn its endorsement into dollars
for Marjorie Clapprood in the 8th Congressional District.
</P>
<P>
   Even NOW president Patricia Ireland was at something of a loss
Tuesday to explain why the largest women's political organization
in the nation waited until only days before the Democratic primary
to embrace the one progressive woman with a real shot at winning
the seat being vacated by US Representative Joseph P. Kennedy II.
</P>
<P>
   From any other source, in any other election year, Ireland's
observation on the State House steps that ``women notoriously make
up our mind at the last minute'' might have sent up howls of
protests. But this year, in Massachusetts, it's true.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of two liberal women in a field of 10 candidates
vying to replace Kennedy seems to have left feminists competing for
space on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   EMILY's List, the Washington-based women's political
fund-raising group, is so attuned to the importance of early money
in a campaign that its acronym stands for Early Money Is Like
Yeast. It gave thousands to the doomed gubernatorial candidacy of
Patricia McGovern but sent not sent a penny into the 8th District.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was too hard to choose in the early going between
Clapprood, a brassy former state legislator with a long record of
leadership on liberal issues, and Susan Tracy, an earnest former
state lawmaker with a reputation as a consensus builder. But
elections are about choice, and the earlier the choice the greater
the influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been watching developments in that congressional race
very closely,'' said Stephanie Cohen of EMILY's List. ``But when we
looked at both candidates earlier, there was not a clearly
demonstrated front-runner. At this point, it's very late to get in.
I wouldn't think we would now.''
</P>
<P>
   But isn't a tight race among a crowded field of like-minded
candidates exactly the time for political contributors to enter the
fray? By holding back money, women's groups may have forfeited the
opportunity to impact the outcome of the race for one of the
nation's legendary House seats, the seat once held by President
John F. Kennedy and Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill Jr.
</P>
<P>
   As the Clapprood campaign rightly notes, there is more at stake
than simply sending a woman to Washington as part of the
Massachusetts congressional delegation. If the nine progressive
candidates split what is expected to be a light vote in the 8th
District, liberals could clear the way for former Boston Mayor
Raymond L. Flynn to resurrect his political career in Congress.
``United we stand, divided it's Flynn'' is Clapprood's new mantra.
</P>
<P>
   That would be bad news for women. Ray Flynn's opposition to the
right of a woman to terminate an unwanted pregnancy was less
relevant in City Hall than it would be on Capitol Hill. Recent
demogoguery surrounding late-term abortions underscores the need to
ensure that the 8th District continues to be represented by an
abortion-rights voice.
</P>
<P>
   Those who consider abortion a marginal issue might want to weigh
the plight of a Westerly, R.I., woman who last week was carrying a
fetus with a fatal brain abnormality. Women &AMP; Infants Hospital in
Providence initially refused to induce labor, knowing that the baby
would die and fearing prosecution under state laws banning some
late-term abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors performed the procedure last Wednesday, with the
anticipated results, only after receiving assurances from the
state's attorney general that doctors would not be charged.
</P>
<P>
   In this kind of atmosphere, do the voters in the 8th District
want to risk sending a regressive voice on abortion to Congress?
</P>
<P>
   A poll of 400 likely voters last week by The Boston Globe and
WBZ-TV showed Clapprood and Somerville Mayor Michael Capuano
deadlocked with Flynn at the top of the pack, with John O'Conner
and George Bachrach not far behind. No candidate garnered more than
16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more significantly, the poll found 14 percent of those
surveyed still undecided. That was a week ago, before the Clapprood
campaign unleased its television ads, before she won the
endorsement of the Lesbian and Gay Political Alliance, before she
got the labor nod, before NOW got off the dime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a quick decision. It wasn't knee jerk. We took our
time,'' Patricia Ireland said Tuesday. ``I wish we'd been in here
earlier.'' She should hope it's not too late.

SPRINGFIELD'S STAND AGAINST AIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After finally getting the City Council to approve needle
exchange by a 5-4 vote in July, Springfield, Mass. Mayor Michael
Albano still has to contend with protesters. The council had
rejected the program by a 5-4 vote in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, outraged citizens tried to get enough signatures to
force a binding referendum on needle exchange. They fell just short
of the 12 percent of Springfield's registered voters. Their near
miss still earned them a nonbinding referendum in November.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Albano does not sound particularly concerned
about the grumbles. The needle exchange program is expected to
begin in about a month. Albano said that should the voters reject
the program, he does not expect the vote to derail it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not one who determines policy by referendum,`` Albano
said. ``I've got a deal with the City Council. We will evaluate the
program after we've had it in place for one full year. When the
council reviews it, (the vote) will be one factor in their decision
to continue or not to continue it. I believe when we sit down a
year from now and look at it from all factors, that the support
will be there to continue the program.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, Albano will not have to contend with even a
nonbinding rejection. The evidence is overwhelming that needle
exchange is an important weapon against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   According to the federal government, injection drug use with
contaminated needles is related to more than 70 percent of HIV
virus infections among women of childbearing age and more than 75
percent of babies diagnosed with HIV or AIDS. Nationally, 40
percent of AIDS cases are associated with injection drug use, but
the percentage zooms to 60 percent and beyond in many urban areas,
including the Massachusetts towns outside of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that such programs increase drug abuse, as
opponents of needle exchange fear. What is far more conclusive is
that needle exchange programs can cut the spread of HIV.
</P>
<P>
   According to data compiled by the Center for AIDS Prevention
Studies at the University of California, San Francisco, needle
exchange is estimated to have cut infection rates among drug users
in New Haven, Conn., by 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, needle exchange has reduced infection rates
from as high as 1-in-14 to 1-in-50. It also has resulted in big
decreases in risky behaviors such as sharing syringes and increases
in safer behaviors, such as wiping needles with alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   In Tacoma, Wash., needle exchange programs have been found to
make participants less likely to contract hepatitis B than
nonparticipants. Seattle has found needle exchange to be a bridge
to drug treatment. In one study, needle exchange participants
redeemed 78 percent of vouchers given to them to enter treatment.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, the Clinton administration acknowledged the
benefits of needle exchange. But it has not yet found the courage
to lift the ban against federal funding of such programs.
</P>
<P>
   Not waiting on Washington, about 120 programs have started
around the nation. Albano's city will be next, and none too soon.
Springfield is the 68th largest metropolitan area in the United
States, but its rate of AIDS is 25th. Springfield estimates that 56
percent of its AIDS cases result from dirty needles. Springfield
will join Boston, Cambridge, Northampton, and Provincetown as the
only other places in Massachusetts that have needle exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to be a probation officer, and working with offenders I
believe anyone who is willing to turn in a needle is a person also
looking for help,'' Albano said. ``I agree that it is an
inconsistent message to tell people to say no to drugs and then
have the city in the position of dispensing needles. But this is a
life and death issue, in my opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Albano said there is a dawning sense in Springfield that public
health must overcome paranoia. He cited an internal poll in 1997 of
300 residents that found 53 percent supported needle exchange, 41
percent opposed it, and 5 percent had no opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Albano knows that while those numbers are encouraging, he cannot
ignore the referendum. How he handles the paranoia is important not
only for Springfield but for all the other mid-sized cities in
Massachusetts which have high AIDS rates but are still too blinded
by false fears to implement needle exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will first try to go the professional health route and try,
through education, to make this a health care issue, one that is
about a healthier Springfield,'' Albano said. ``If I get a
political sense that the other side is gaining momentum, we may go
the ad route.... We have a crisis here and needle exchange is one
way of getting at it. Given the statistics and where we are, this
is clearly the right thing to do.''

WILDE ABOUT CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We began 1998 by hearing about Bill Clinton's alleged paramour,
and no subject has exhausted more word processors or caused the
slaughter of more pine trees than Bill doing the nasty with Monica.
</P>
<P>
   Who'll have the last word on this tawdry bit of business? How to
end this yammering? I put the question to none other than Oscar
Wilde, whose answers to the question, ``America wants to know,'' or
at least, what the people who run the media think America wants to
know, come courtesy of Peter Pauper Press, publisher of -``Oscar
Wilde: Epigrams'':
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL; 
(Eds.: Sentences in quotes shud be in italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So, Oscar: how could a smart guy like Clinton get get into this
mess?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing looks so like innocence as an indiscretion.''
</P>
<P>
   Aren't world leaders supposed to be moral exemplars?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you present to be good, the world takes you very seriously.
If you pretend to be bad, it doesn't. Such is the astounding
stupidity of optimism.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmm. Let me mull that over. What about Hillary and the marriage?
</P>
<P>
   ``... The wives hold all the honors and invariably lose the odd
trick.''
</P>
<P>
   But isn't she the real victim in all this?
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is packed with good women. To know them is a
middle-class education ... Wicked women bother one, good women bore
one. That is the only difference between them.''
</P>
<P>
   Do you think Hillary should stand by her man after all this?
</P>
<P>
   ``Women always want one to be good. And if we are good when they
meet us, they don't love us at all. They like to find us quite
irretrievably bad and to leave us quite unattractively good.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmm. My hunch is Hillary finds Bill `retrievably bad,' but
thinks she can still whip him into acceptable shape. Is that a
possibility?
</P>
<P>
   ``The world has grown suspicious of anything that looks like a
happy married life.... One can always recognize women who trust
their husbands, they look so thoroughly unhappy.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Mr. Wilde, for crying out loud, look at what the lady puts
up with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men are such cowards. They outrage every law of the world, and
are afraid of the world's tongue.... Misfortunes one can endure _
they come from outside, they are accidents. But to suffer for one's
own faults _ Ah! There is the sting of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, you have to admit Clinton is still very popular in
countries like Ireland, where he just visited, and was received
quite rapturously.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one could only teach the English how to talk and the Irish
how to listen society would be quite civilized.''
</P>
<P>
   You were quite a wordsmith in your day. What do you think of
journalism now?
</P>
<P>
   ``Spies are of no use nowadays. Their profession is over. The
newspapers do their work instead.''
</P>
<P>
   Do you think journalists are too free with their advice these
days?
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing to do with good advice is to pass it on. It is
never of any use to oneself.''
</P>
<P>
   Are you suggesting journalists are being hypocritical about
Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we are so pleased to find out other people's
secrets is that it distracts public attention from our own.''
</P>
<P>
   What lesson should American women take from Clinton's situation?
</P>
<P>
   ``Modern women understand everything except their husbands.''
</P>
<P>
   (Gulp!) Er, could you explain that?
</P>
<P>
   ``Plain women are always jealous of their husbands, beautiful
women never are; they have no time, they are always so occupied in
being jealous of other people's husbands.... Women have become so
highly educated that nothing should surprise them except happy
marriages.... Men always want to be a woman's first love _ women
like to be a man's last romance.''
</P>
<P>
   Why does Clinton get hung up with women like Gennifer Flowers,
Paula Jones, or Monica Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   ``A bad woman is the sort of woman a man never gets tired of.''
</P>
<P>
   You're kidding, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``The history of woman is the history of the worst form of
tyranny the world has ever known: the tyranny of the weak over the
strong. It is the only tyranny that lasts.''
</P>
<P>
   Oscar, do the words `politically correct' mean anything to you?
</P>
<P>
   ``The only difference between a saint and a sinner is that every
saint has a past, and every sinner has a future.''?
</P>
<P>
   But what about those demanding resignation or impeachment? Even
if the voters liked the president's personality, what about the
principle?
</P>
<P>
   ``It is personalities not principles that move the age.''
</P>
<P>
   But what are Americans to believe, given all furor over Lady
Monica?
</P>
<P>
   ``The old believe everything; the middle aged suspect
everything; the young know everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Wow. That's deep. So you think we should just turn Bill over to
Hillary?
</P>
<P>
   ``Women give to men the very gold of their lives, but they
invariably want it back in very small change.''
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't repeat that to Hillary, if you happen to run into
her. Do you really think Bill can recover from this? Will most
people forgive him?
</P>
<P>
   ``... (most people) discover, when it is too late, that the only
things one never regrets are one's mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Oscar, that is so profound, I'll have to think about it for
days. But I can't let you go without asking your opinion of the
media's performance?
</P>
<P>
   ``There is much to be said in favor of modern journalism. By
giving us the opinions of the uneducated, it keeps us in touch with
the ignorance of the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Thank you... I think. Any final word to Bill Clinton, Oscar?
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the
stars.''

A QUIET PRICE CRISIS STALKING US FARMERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, Neb. _ The Nebraska State Fair is in its final days,
and Hedrick's Racing Pigs are as fast and sleek as they'll ever be,
having delighted crowds during two weeks of three-pig pileups on a
tiny oval.
</P>
<P>
   Over at the agricultural exhibit building, Evelyn Lorenz of
Yutan has already won the ``largest ear of corn'' category, while
nearby displays overflow with Nebraska pride: soybeans, tomatoes
and squash; potatoes, eggplant and onions, with a 100-pound
watermelon thrown in for good measure.
</P>
<P>
   All along Cornhusker Highway en route to the fairgrounds,
endless acres of corn are watched over by grain elevators as long
as city blocks. The 7-foot stalks are proof of a planting season so
successful, of farms managed so well, that October promises the
second-biggest harvest in state history.
</P>
<P>
   But while the fairgoers are smiling and the fields are full and
the pigs seem happy, tension and fear are building throughout farm
country. US farmers are quietly suffering through a ``price
crisis'' _ one federal official calls it ``an economic stealth
disaster'' _ affecting grain as well as livestock. It is a crisis
born not of drought or floods, but of a churlish Asian economy, the
changing relationship between the US government and the nation's
farmers, and the precarious nature of farming itself.
</P>
<P>
   And so, in the coming weeks, Congress might well be drawn back
into the farm business just two years after it enacted the landmark
Freedom to Farm Act, which phases out Depression-era subsidies by
2002 and replaces them with a system that emphasizes letting
farmers grow what the market will buy. That flexibility was a
long-term dream of the farm industry, but now its powerful lobby is
demanding new action before lawmakers' planned October recess.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other farm crises, the price problems in Nebraska and
elsewhere are not the result of ``act of God'' catastrophes
familiar even to urban Americans. They are distinct from the
drought in Texas and Oklahoma, the disease afflicting North Dakota
wheat, and the rains that drenched the upper Midwest. In fact,
Nebraska farms look downright bucolic.
</P>
<P>
   ``People see our farm, all the corn, and don't realize there's a
crisis. Things look good from the outside,'' said Christie Tomes,
who works with her husband and four children farming 1,100 acres of
seed corn in Utica, about an hour outside Lincoln. ``We're losing
our butts, and it's going to shut a lot of people down.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomes and other farmers are victims of a basic economic
principle _ supply and demand _ exaggerated by the gyrations of
global markets.
</P>
<P>
   On the supply side, good weather and smart planting have
resulted in harvests so large that storage and transport systems
are in danger of being overwhelmed. The supply was further engorged
by an unusual number of farmers who stored their grain last year,
waiting for price hikes that never arrived.
</P>
<P>
   On the demand side, the Asian financial meltdown has cut exports
by millions of bushels. When Indonesian leader B.J. Habibie
suggested that his countrymen fast twice a week to preserve foreign
currency, farm wags said he was really taking food out of US
farmers' mouths.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 million US farm acres are devoted to export markets,
and 40 percent of those are aimed at Asian countries, says the US
Department of Agriculture. With those markets flagging, exports
have dropped and prices have, too, lowering projected 1998 farm
income to $42.5 billion, about 20 percent below the high of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Though the price drops have hit soybeans, wheat, cattle, and
hogs as well, Nebraska corn provides a particularly vivid example.
Add up most costs of producing corn on a well-run farm with rich
soil _ seed, fertilizer, land, labor, etc. _ and it comes to
roughly $2.60 a bushel, more if management costs are included, said
Don Hutchens, executive director of the Nebraska Corn Board. Prices
have averaged only around $1.80 a bushel this year, and in some
places are now well under $1.50, he said. Every bushel sold today
is a loss.
</P>
<P>
   That means Clint Jensen of Aurora will have no profitable way to
sell the 180,000 bushels of ripening corn he expects to harvest
next month, not to mention the 25,000 bushels he stored from last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Jensen, 41, offers a city-dweller's ideal of farm life. He and
his brother, Andy, farm the 1,000-plus acres their grandfather and
father assembled, with side businesses _ from fertilizer sales to
sheep breeding _ to stay ahead of the game. But with the crop
prices down, equipment auctions are starting and the 1980s farm
meltdown is on people's minds. One friend is giving up now, before
the harvest, ``to beat the rush,'' said Clint Jensen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farmers aren't looking for a handout. Farmers aren't looking
for sympathy. We're looking for some help with things that are
completely out of our control,'' Jensen said.
</P>
<P>
   Arlie Sholes, a staff member at the Rural Response Hotline in
Walthill, said new callers to the crisis center have almost doubled
in recent months to five or six a week, and he expects it to get
worse before it gets better.
</P>
<P>
   Sholes said the only significant difference between now and the
1980s crisis is that ``back then, we weren't aware that so many
people were going to have to quit farming. Now, if you're a farmer
or rancher, you're already aware that there are going to be people
off the land.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Republicans have generally lined up behind calls
to leave the Freedom to Farm Act alone, opting instead to focus on
improving exports. They want to replenish the depleted
International Monetary Fund, which provides loans to shaky
economies in exchange for changes in trade policies that could open
big new markets to US farmers. GOP senators also want to give the
president fast-track negotiating power over trade pacts _ which
would require Congress to approve or reject such deals without
changes _ and exempt agricultural and medical exports from trade
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we don't want to do is return to the days of
government control and command planting,'' said Senator Chuck
Hagel, a Nebraska Republican. ``The best solution to this is
opening markets.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic senators and the Clinton administration _ as well
as a few Republicans _ have called instead for more direct
financial action, including changes in a loan program that would
effectively raise commodity price supports, and reauthorizing a
fund under which the government pays farmers who store their grain
while waiting for price hikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're focusing on the safety net. Right now, it isn't
sufficient to buffer farmers when there are natural disasters and
economic disasters,'' said August Schumacher Jr., USDA
undersecretary for farm and foreign agricultural services.
</P>
<P>
   Already, President Clinton has signed a measure that accelerates
the dispersal of $5.5 billion in 1999 payments to farmers under the
1996 farm law, and there is widespread expectation that at least
$500 million will be authorized for emergency aid to the
hardest-hit farms.
</P>
<P>
   But back at the fair, all that seems far away. Christie Tomes is
watching her daughter and two eldest sons care for the hogs they
have raised in hope of winning 4-H ribbons. Her youngest,
9-year-old Schuyler, is at home helping his dad. ``He loves to
farm,'' she said. ``Who knows if it'll be there when he's ready for
it.''

GRAND ROYAL'S OLD-FASHIONED GRAND MASTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Some people might interpret this as a low point in a
man's career: It's 1984 and, after two years as a publicist at one
of Boston's top punk/new wave independent record labels, Mark Kates
has been sacked. Two months later, he is spotted in full patriot
regalia _ tri-cornered hat, bright red uniform and all _ working as
a tour guide at the Boston Tea Party. Definitely not punk.
</P>
<P>
   Kates, now 37 and at the top of the music business, laughs when
those days are brought up _ ``You actually ran into me?'' _ but
he's hardly embarrassed. ``I didn't have any money and had to do
something to keep myself from going crazy,'' he says. ``I was an
American studies major, I've always been into history. So it was
something that I actually really enjoyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Kates is a happy camper himself these days _ and has been for
some time. On the immediate front, he's at Fenway Park watching the
Red Sox. Baseball is one of his big loves and, though he's lived in
Los Angeles for 13 years, the Red Sox are his guys. Kates is back
in the area on a late summer vacation with his wife Beth Bellis and
1 1/2-year-old son Nick. He's been visiting his folks in Lexington,
spending time on Cape Cod with friends.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a longer view of happiness, a good argument can be made
that Kates has climbed the furthest up the ladder of any former
Bostonian on the music industry. Local boy makes very good, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Upon leaving Boston in 1985, he worked for independent label,
Big Time, with bands such as Redd Kross and Hoodoo Gurus. In 1987,
he moved Geffen/DCG, where he spent 10 years, first doing
alternative pop promotion and, then, A&AMP;R (or talent scout). He
signed Beck and Elastica. He helped nurture Nirvana, and was with
them in Bill's Bar in Boston the day before the mega-selling
``Nevermind'' was released. ``I feel so lucky to have known those
guys,'' Kates says, recalling the intense excitement surrounding
the album, and the friendships formed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Kates is the president of Grand Royal, the label formed by
the Beastie Boys, one of the top bands in the country. Grand Royal
is the recording home of Sean Lennon, Buffalo Daughter, Ben Lee,
and Lucious Jackson. Kates even moonlights as a DJ at a pirate
radio station in LA, and as a drum-'n'-bass turntablist named DJ
Carbo _ after former Red Sox outfielder Bernie.
</P>
<P>
   Kates says his strength is not necessarily finding artists but
working with them. Meeting with producers and publishers, making
sure everyting moves properly from raw demo stage to the finished
product. Sonic Youth, White Zombie, and Hole were among his
charges. (When Hole's Courtney Love ran into him backstage at Great
Woods on the 1994 Lollapalooza tour, she turned Kates's face red by
greeting him by lifting her dress up over her head.) He was the
co-executive producer on the Grammy nominated soundtrack ``Beavis
and Butt-head Do America.''
</P>
<P>
   The Beastie Boys Mike Diamond (a.k.a. Mike D.) brought Kates
into the Grand Royal fold earlier this year. Kates's contract at
Geffen was running out. The label's orientation had changed from
its earlier days; it had been purchased by Seagram's. ``I had a
great job,'' says Kates, ``but it occurred to me that the guys I
was working for weren't necessarily in charge anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Diamond says he met Kates when he brought them to the Rat, the
now-defunct home of Boston punk rock, when the young Beastie Boys
Worcester Centrum with Madonna in 1985. They had a mutual friend in
another former Bostonian John Silva, who manages the Beasties and
others.
</P>
<P>
   They made more substantial contact in Los Angeles. ``Mark was
always kind of ubiquitious,'' says Diamond, of Kates's Geffen days.
``He would be there with Beck, he was tight with our manager, and
he came around to a lot of our shows and different functions. He
was a big fan of a lot of the people who were on Grand Royal before
he was there.''
</P>
<P>
   Grand Royal was formed in 1992. ``It's a small group of 10
people working there and a lot of the onus of actually running it
fell on me,'' says Diamond. ``The idea of having Mark come in was
to have a true parnter who could be dedicated full time, whereas
obviously I've already got a full-time committment here. The
hardest thing in having someone come in is he had to be somebody
who would really relate to us musically, culturally, and
artistically. That's the kind of thing that can't be taught. It's
really a sensibility issue. With Mark, we felt strongly he shared
that sensibility. Beyond that, it's a combination of someone coming
from an independent label world and the major label world. That's
something that's very important to us, existing within both of
those worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds entertainment attorney Walter McDonough, a friend of
Kates's for 15 years: ``He's very honest. He's done so well because
the artists trust him. Even when he left Geffen he remained friends
with the people he worked with. He's a throwback, someone in an
administrative position who knows how to make records.''
</P>
<P>
   Kates is not one to beat his chest. ``I think you have to
convince yourself that nothing is really about you, because usually
it isn't,'' he says. ``I've been lucky to work with unbelievably
talented people.''
</P>
<P>
   Kates, who owns a small slice of Grand Royal, wears several
hats. He says that ``when all you have to do all all day is worry
about artistic and musical things, it is the greatest job in the
world. I'd like to be doing more of it, but when you run a company
there are things you never have had to think about before, like
managing people.'' He says the label wants to build careers, not
just score quick hits, ``even if that's old-fashioned.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Grand Royal's aims is to have a sense of aesthetics, to
be a label that means something to fans. ``Grand Royal is defined
by its artists; it's defined by the Beastie Boys,'' says Kates.
(The Beastie Boys actually record for Capitol, but record side
projects and vinyl for Grand Royal.) ``I believe everything that
band does is meaningful to a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ufdots &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Kates grew up in Lexington, attended Deerfield Prepatory School,
went to summer school at Boston University and graduated with a
degree in American studies from George Washington University. His
non-rock work includes interning for the late Sen. Paul Tsongas,
data processing for what was then Bank of Boston, and working on
John Anderson's presidential campaign. His early music business
jobs included an internship at WBCN-FM, working as a college DJ,
booking concerts, doing publicity for Boston's Ace of Hearts
records, and, briefly, working for the band Public image, Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   Kates was bit by the late-1970s punk rock bug, especially bands
from Boston, Mission of Burma in particular, and England. He chose
music over politics. ``I learned a lot (from Tsongas),'' says
Kates, ``and realized he was the exception among politicians in
terms of sincerity. My classes were filled with people who were
going to be the next generation of the people other than Paul
Tsongas _ just in it for themselves. A lot of people, including me,
go to Washington having this altruistic attitude. It's hopeless.
Forget it. It makes the music business look squeaky clean.''
</P>
<P>
   Kates has a number of former Bostonian peers in the biz. A
handfull include: the aformentioned John Silva, Debbie
Southwood-Smith, A&AMP;R director for A&AMP;M; Julie Farman, Epic/MCA
publicist-turned-writer; Chuck Bliziotis, senior v.p. of operations
at A&AMP;M; Jackie Simms at ASCAP publishing; Michelle Scoleri, an
agent at Premier Talent; Steve Berkowitz, A&AMP;R at Columbia; Leslie
Green, attorney for Jellybean Benitez; Chris Porter, Seattle-based
booking agent.
</P>
<P>
   Kates is an optimist. ``By nature,'' he says. ``I mean I've had
plenty of times in my life, or in this profession, that have been
negative. But you just have to get past them.'' He credits Rick
Harte _ the owner of Ace of Hearts, the man who fired him back in
'84 _ with schooling him in the business. His biggest
disappointment, professionally, was the failure of Jawbreaker, a
band he signed to Geffen. A current frustration is that he feels
we're in a fallow period today in the rock world.
</P>
<P>
   When he looks back at his journey through the music business
world, he says, ``You've got to take chances. It's probably
something I don't do enough of in some ways.'' His professional
goal? ``I just want to be stimulated, because I feel like if I'm
stimulated, I'm not completely out of touch with the world.''

J. BAKER YEARNING TO BE A `CATEGORY KILLER' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   J. Baker Inc. is betting that TV shows such as ``ER'' and
``Chicago Hope'' can do what Paris designers couldn't _ bring color
and fashion to the once all-white world of hospital haberdashery.
</P>
<P>
   Want surgical scrubs in such colors as sea spray and honey? Then
the place to go may be Rx Uniforms, a sort of boutique for nurses
that is one of several ideas that J. Baker, a Canton-based
retailer, is testing as it looks to make a big comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to be a category killer,'' says executive vice
president Roger J. Osborne, using retail lingo for a type of store
that dominates a merchandise category and crushes the competition.
</P>
<P>
   J. Baker knows what it's like to get squeezed, if not crushed.
It once mostly sold footwear in such chains as Parade of Shoes. But
as competition increased, J. Baker got hurt along with many other
footwear merchants in the mid 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   J. Baker now sees much of its future in apparel. At its Casual
Male Big &AMP; Tall, Work 'n Gear, and Rx Uniforms chains, it sells
clothes to such underserved consumers as large men, construction
workers, and fashion-minded nurses.
</P>
<P>
   Part of J. Baker's ``major turnaround'' strategy is to occupy
retail ``niches where there is very little competition,'' says
Peter N. Schaeffer, an analyst with Warburg Dillon Read LLC.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as a decade ago, few people would have thought that
there was a fashion niche for health-care wear.
</P>
<P>
   In an era when a tonsillectomy meant spending a night in the
hospital, many nurses were required to wear white uniforms, which
hospital employers often provided and sometimes paid for.
</P>
<P>
   No more. First came the move toward casual clothing, which
prompted many hospitals to relax dress codes. Then, health
maintenance organizations began slashing uniform subsidies to
nurses as a way to cut costs, Osborne says.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in the popularity of ``ER'' and ``Chicago Hope,'' where TV
nurses were as well versed in Vogue as in first aid, and suddenly
many real-life nurses no longer wanted to wear just white.
</P>
<P>
   If nurses now must pay for their work clothes, many want smocks
and scrubs in such hues as teal, taupe, and soft peach, and Rx
Uniforms is only too happy to give them what they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``The health care industry employs about 8 million people,''
Osborne says. ``And they spend between $1 billion and $1.5 billion
on clothes every year.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, much of that money goes to catalog companies and
mom-and-pop stores. According to Osborne, Rx Uniforms has the
potential to be the first big chain to serve stylish nurses.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a far cry from Rx Uniforms' humble beginnings as a
small department in J. Baker's Work 'n Gear division, a chain of
roughly 65 clothing-and-footwear stores that count construction and
restaurant workers among its best customers.
</P>
<P>
   As sales grew, Rx Uniforms evolved into a
``store-within-a-store'' at Work 'n Gear. Encouraged by success, J.
Baker has opened three free-standing Rx Uniforms stores in the last
year.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, J. Baker is also experimenting with a store
format, which opened last week in Dedham, in which Work 'n Gear and
Rx Uniforms share equal billing, each with its own doorway and
exterior signage.
</P>
<P>
   While Rx Uniforms may be a winner someday, the big driver behind
any J. Baker turnaround has to be Casual Male Big &AMP; Tall, a chain
of about 460 stores, many of them recently remodeled and
remerchandised with such brands as Dockers and Perry Ellis.
</P>
<P>
   J. Baker is also preparing to launch a chain called Grande
Central, which will aim at a slightly more affluent big-and-tall
customer than Casual Male. The plan is to open 40 stores by this
time next year.
</P>
<P>
   Because so few stores offer big men anything approaching
one-stop shopping, Grande Central is designed to help fill a void.
</P>
<P>
   If a large woman wants to buy a dress, she has many shopping
options, but men whose waistlines measure 40 inches or more or who
stand 6 feet 2 inches or taller can be hard pressed to find
fashions they want, J. Baker claims.
</P>
<P>
   Although they account for about 15 percent of men's clothing
sales, oversized men are largely underserved, and the market is
highly fragmented, says Alan I. Weinstein, J. Baker's president and
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   A chain called Rochester Big &AMP; Tall caters to men who are large,
wealthy, and wear suits to work. But for the middle-income and
working-class casual customer that J. Baker targets, competition
comes mostly from mom-and-pop stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to dominate the big-and-tall market, which we
think is a $5.5 billion business,'' says Stuart M. Glasser, who
took over J. Baker's big-and-tall business a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   J. Baker's efforts at a turnaround are reflected in its numbers.
As it shed such chains as Fayva and Parade of Shoes, revenues
dropped from $1.02 billion three years ago to $592.1 million in its
most recent fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Shoes once accounted for about 75 percent of revenues; last
year, they generated about 45 percent of sales, Weinstein says. &UR;  &LR; J.
Baker continues to operate licensed shoe departments in discount
department stores such as Ames and Bradlees and has no plans to
sell those operations, Weinstein says.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, J. Baker lost $111.4 million, but regained
profitability last year, earning $3.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   All these changes have taken a toll on J. Baker's stock. Its
shares, traded on Nasdaq, have swung from 4 1/8 in January up to
nearly 14 in June. On Friday, shares closed at 7 59/64.
</P>
<P>
   Given the prospects of Rx Uniforms, Casual Male, and Grande
Central, the stock may be a bargain, some analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to their peers, the stock is very inexpensive,'' says
Lazard Freres &AMP; Co. analyst Mark Picard, who has a buy rating on J.
Baker.

SBA PROGRAM DELIVERS FOR MINORITY BUSINESSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY ACKERMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Two small Massachusetts high-tech companies have been
honored by the US Small Business Administration as evidence that a
controversial federal program designed to help budding young
minority-owned businesses does, in fact, deliver on its promise.
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, the program, which gives an edge to start-up
companies owned by ethnic minorities in seeking certain federal
contracts, brought no immediate income to either firm as it started
out. Both had to bid for their first contracts.
</P>
<P>
   But the founders say that for each, the SBA's 8(a) program was
important in helping establish their credentials in a crowded field
in which they might otherwise have been ignored. And, they say, the
work they received under the program provided financial stability
while they built up their businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like having a mentor,'' said Triveni Upadhyay, 52, the
Indian-born founder of Mayflower Communications Co. Inc. of
Billerica. ``The company must do its own marketing, but if the SBA
qualifies you, the customer knows you can do the work.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayflower, founded in 1986, specializes in global positioning
satellite (GPS) technology and is developing devices to protect
vital airplane navigational gear against outside radio jamming. The
company has grown from two employees to 20, Upadhyay said, and had
``between $2 million and $3 million'' in revenues last year.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Gemini's founder, Victoria Bondoc, 38, said the
program let her ``compete against other firms of similar background
instead of companies six times bigger than we were.''
</P>
<P>
   Gemini, which provides engineering and operational support
services to the Air Force, the US Department of Transportation, and
other federal agencies, also was founded in 1986. Today it has more
than 100 full-time and part-time employees, Bondoc said, and took
in $4 million in revenues in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The 8(a) program is named after the section of the federal Small
Business Act that describes it. It was established in 1969 to help
``socially and economically disadvantaged individuals,'' a
definition that covers more than 40 specific ethnic minorities by
race and nationality.
</P>
<P>
   The program has come under frequent fire, accused of failing to
foster enterprises with growth potential and creating a sinecure
for companies that relied on it for all their income _ and then
went out of business when their eligibility expired.
</P>
<P>
   The SBA acknowledges the program had flaws and says it has
tightened up its rules in recent years. Since Republicans
threatened to kill it entirely in 1996, the SBA has required
participants to reduce their reliance on it to no more than 25
percent of income by the time they ``graduate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to help companies grow so they can sustain
themselves,'' said Barbara Manning, a program manager at the SBA's
office in Boston. ``The idea is that they will continue on, growing
their sales and profits.''
</P>
<P>
   The SBA said small businesses are generally growing faster than
big ones, and woman-owned and minority-owned businesses are growing
fastest of all. ``When I look at the daily ups and downs of the Dow
Jones average, I think the thing that would really scare me would
be if I saw a lot of small business failures,'' said Patrick
McGowan, SBA regional administator in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   McGowan said &UR;  &LR; recognizing gains by firms such as Gemini and
Mayflower ``helps show other entrepreneurs out there that you can
make it, even when you have a background that does not include
having been in this country for 200 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Bondoc, who was born in Canada to Filipino parents just before
they emigrated to Boston in 1960, was cited as the SBA's
Massachusetts Minority Small Business Person of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Upadhyay was named the SBA's 8(a) Graduate of the Year, marking
his firm's success as its eligibility is expiring.
</P>
<P>
   While lacking business credentials when they set up their
businesses, Upadhyay and Bondoc had ample other experience.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving in the United States in 1968, Upadhyay earned a
master's degree in electrical engineering from Princeton University
and a doctorate from the University of Texas. He then worked for 13
years on global positioning satellite projects for Texas
Instruments Inc. in Austin and the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory
in Cambridge, before launching Mayflower.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that work, Upadhyay said, he saw that mobile
telephones, laptop computers, video games, and other electronic
applications were generating radio waves that could interfere with
GPS systems, including aircraft navigational units.
</P>
<P>
   That is why airline passengers now are ordered to turn off such
devices during takeoffs and landings, and use of cellular
telephones is forbidden at all times during flights, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Upadhyay said he set up Mayflower to specialize in further
research and find ways to protect GPS receivers from this
interference.
</P>
<P>
   Ten prototype antijamming units that use patented technology
Upadhyay and Mayflower developed now are being tested and evaluated
by airlines and others.
</P>
<P>
   Upadhyay said he expected the 8(a) program to give Mayflower a
boost at the beginning, but soon found his primary potential
clients, the Air Force and the Federal Aviation Administration,
preferred competitive bidding for high technology research and
development work as a way to encourage innovation.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the 8(a) program has provided Mayflower only
one-fourth of its $20 million in total revenues over 12 years, he
said. Its greatest value, he said, came in 1990, when Mayflower was
given a noncompetitive, five-year, $2.8 million FAA contract to
explore the extent of the GPS interference problem.
</P>
<P>
   That work ``allowed us to see that interference was a problem on
the commercial side as well as the military side of GPS,'' Upadhyay
said, showing the size of the market for antijamming devices.
</P>
<P>
   Bondoc also saw the 8(a) program as a gateway to win a niche in
the government's move toward privatization of services.
</P>
<P>
   Bondoc graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
in 1981 with a mathematics degree and worked for five years _ while
also earning a master's degree in computer science from Boston
University _ at MITRE Corp. in Bedford and at consulting firm &UR;  &LR; Booz
Allen &AMP; Hamilton.

<P>
   Much of her work was on projects conn

MASSACHUSETTS INSURANCE CHIEF UNDER FIRE BY FORMER EMPLOYEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A lot of people have taken a shot at the state's quirky
Insurance commissioner, Linda Ruthardt. Steve D'Amato has not been
one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, D'Amato has been one of those faceless bureaucrats who
make state government work. Before resigning quietly last month, he
spent a dozen years at the State Rating Bureau, a unit of the
Insurance Division that helps oversee all kinds of rates, from
automobile to workers' compensation to health insurance. D'Amato
has worked for five commissioners, two acting commissioners, and
headed the rating bureau for the past seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Now out, D'Amato has a message for Acting Governor Paul
Cellucci: Linda Ruthardt has got to go.
</P>
<P>
   In a take-no-prisoners letter to Cellucci Tuesday, D'Amato
blasted Ruthardt for being too cozy with the insurance industry and
too ready to serve the political interests of both the Weld and
Cellucci administrations. The much-ballyhooed decreases in rates
for auto and workers' compensation insurance, he says, have come
despite Ruthardt, not because of her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have little faith in the commissioner's ability and
willingness to protect consumers and employers from the insurer
lobbyists that contact her regularly,'' D'Amato said in his letter.
``The actions of the commissioner during her tenure ... indicate
that she is too closely aligned with the insurers to protect the
public adequately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Furthermore, the commissioner has developed adversarial
relationships with many of the individuals and organizations that
represent the interests of the public on insurance matters.
Consequently, decisions are often made by the commissioner without
the input of, and without consideration of, the very public that
pays us to protect it.''
</P>
<P>
   Being the insurance commissioner is no fun. Top to bottom, the
little department is outgunned and underpaid as it tries to
regulate one of best-financed industries in the world. The state's
last insurance commissioner was forced out after letting lobbyists
pick up one too many checks for dinner and drinks. For all her
eccentricities no one has ever accused Ruthardt of being dishonest.
</P>
<P>
   But in her six years in office, Ruthardt has been involved in an
unusual number of high-profile dust-ups. The most infamous of the
snafus was the General Electric insurer that petitioned the state
to move to Bermuda and promptly filed for liquidation, allowing it
to use the more favorable climate there to get the upper hand
against its reinsurers. In another case, the state attorney general
dumped her office as a client, citing ``ethical issues'' raised by
the Insurance Division's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday afternoon, Rut-hardt said she had not seen D'Amato's
letter and couldn't comment. When offered a copy by fax, she
declined, saying: ``If Steve has written the governor that is his
ability. He can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's office called D'Amato's letter
``self-promotional,'' an attempt to take the credit for the state's
big rate declines. ``It is clear from anyone who knows the industry
that no one person is responsible for the unprecedented decrease in
rates over the past five years,'' said Kim Hinden McDonald, a
spokeswoman for the Office of Consumer Affairs, which oversees the
Insurance Division. She labeled D'Amato's letter ``a parting shot''
by an employee who has had personal and professional disagreements
with the commissioner for years.
</P>
<P>
   That was hardly the Insurance Division's view when D'Amato
announced his resignation last month. A spokesman said at the time
that ``the commissioner recognizes that Steve has done an excellent
job. He's been good news for consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, who has said he wants to remain active in insurance
issues but has not detailed his plans, declined to comment Tuesday.
But in his letter to Cellucci he said Rut-hardt ``had consistently
pressured me to accommodate the insurers in my dealings with them
on rating issues.'' He said she had ``often retaliated'' against
him and ``sometimes she threatened my job, telling me that the
governor's office wanted to get rid of me because insurers had
complaints.''
</P>
<P>
   He goes on to detail what he calls ``a familiar pattern of
pressure'' from Ruthardt on behalf of the Weld-Cellucci
administrations.
</P>
<P>
   In one recent case, D'Amato recounts how the insurance industry
was able to minimize a cut in workers' comp rates by delaying the
effective date. D'Amato says he pressed the commissioner to require
the insurers to file rates earlier for the coming year, but he says
she refused. He quotes Ruthardt as saying: ``The governor's office
doesn't want us to.''
</P>
<P>
   In another instance, D'Amato says the State Rating Bureau was in
the middle of litigating auto rates in the fall of 1996 when a
member of Ruthardt's staff came to him and said the industry was
willing to accept a 1 percent cut in rates. ``He told me that the
announcement of a negotiated rate decrease in October would be
helpful to the Weld Senate campaign. He mentioned that a litigated
result, while perhaps reducing rates by more than 1 percent, could
not be decided until well after the election.''
</P>
<P>
   All insurance commissioners, of course, are accused of playing
politics, but Ruthardt has reinforced that impression herself. Last
year she told a legislative committee investigating the General
Electric affair that she believed a top Weld official was once
pressuring her to drop the matter. She later called it a
misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Misunderstanding or not, D'Amato's postscript will do little to
erase the image that this is a commissioner who is all too ready to
serve her boss, the governor.
</P>
<P>

The Red Herring
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR; Essex Investment Management in Boston, the firm that managed
President Clinton's money in a blind trust since 1993, has resigned
the account.
</P>
<P>
   An Essex spokesman confirmed Tuesday the firm gave up the
Clinton account in April. He said Essex didn't discuss clients and
declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   The change took place just months after Affiliated Managers
Group of Boston bought a majority interest in Essex. One of
Affiliated's directors: former Governor William Weld, who was
Clinton's unsuccessful nominee to become ambassador to Mexico.

ELWAY AGAIN WAS A MASTER AT WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The total yardage for the Patriots was 339. That of the
Broncos was 339. If statistics lie, they lied in indicating there
was not much difference between the New England Patriots and the
Denver Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if we put a complete game together, I mean we could be
on top of them,'' said New England safety Lawyer Milloy after the
Patriots' 27-21 loss Monday night. ``But we didn't, and they were a
better football team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots were good, but much of football already knew that.
But if New England is to move from good to very good and possibly
great, it need only look over to No. 7 _ John Elway, who for maybe
the 100th time was outstanding against the Patriots. Elway time and
again made the smart play, the big play, the key play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flags?'' said Milloy of the seven penalties accumulated by the
Patriots. ``That's been haunting us in the past and it's still
haunting us. We have to find some kind of way to compensate for
that kind of stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Optimists may see light. New England discovered a running back,
rookie Robert Edwards. New England shut down Denver's Terrell Davis
as few defenses do. New England didn't fold after being down, 17-0.
Most of all, New England didn't make excuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did all the things that violated all the principles of
being a championship club,'' said coach Pete Carroll. ``We made it
so difficult on ourselves time and again, whether it was a penalty
or miscue or whatever. It was too much to overcome because they're
such a good team.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll knew all too well what the game meant for the Patriots.
It was an opportunity to make a statement that New England was not
merely a good football.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a special night with an opportunity so good for our
club,'' said the coach. ``But we missed an opportunity by making so
many mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Drew Bledsoe was good, but Elway was very good. The Patriot
defense shut down Davis but allowed wide receiver Ed McCaffrey to
find open space time and again. New England did much; Denver did
more.
</P>
<P>
   The fear of Elway was so great, conceded Patriots safety Willie
Clay, ``that we didn't dump our whole arsenal (of blitz packages)''
on the QB. ``We had our chances to win this game, but we didn't
come through with the plays when we needed to make them.''
</P>
<P>
   One in particular stood out. On Denver's first touchdown, Elway
looked right and then threw left to tight end Shannon Sharpe,
inexcusably alone in the end zone several yards behind Milloy, for
a 12-yard scoring pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quarterback pumped it,'' said Clay, ``and I was supposed
to come over and help Lawyer. But I was like 7 or 8 yards away, and
it was a tough play. It was a great play on their part.''
</P>
<P>
   Which could sum up the entire game.
</P>
<P>
   Denver had the ultimate impact player in Elway. The Patriots had
good plays from Bledsoe, a few good catches from Terry Glenn, good
defense, but no impact player who made the play that would make the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you lose the game, it's a negative,'' said Glenn, who
came somewhat alive in the second half after a quiet first half.
``We came out in the second half and tried to get things going.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn said he wasn't disoriented or distracted by playing in the
high-decibel chaos of Mile High Stadium. ``Actually,'' said the
wide receiver, ``I like playing here. It gives you a sense of
urgency to quiet the crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, like Bledsoe and the defense, must have that urgency to
make an impact if New England is to be more than a good team. Glenn
can't be content with making a few catches here and there; he must
make the play that decides games.
</P>
<P>
   As receiver Shawn Jefferson summed up, ``We certainly didn't
help ourselves. We beat ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``good'' label applied this night also could apply to the
coaches. Denver clearly surprised New England, among other things,
by doing what it seldom does _ sending linebacker Bill Romanowski
on blitzes _ while New England blitzes were often too late or
merely eluded by that master, John Elway.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first game of the season, not the last. The Patriots
played well but must take that next step to be very good. John
Elway can be the living lesson on how to take that step.
</P>
<P>
   Good is never enough for a champion.

GLENN FINALLY CAUGHT FIRE IN THE SECOND HALF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Underneath the grass and dirt-stained No. 88 uniform
was a blue Superman shirt with a red ``S.''
</P>
<P>
   If anyone is capable of living up to the legend, it is Terry
Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   Fast, sleek, with big hands and remarkable agility, the Patriots
wide receiver certainly looked more like a player who wanted to
recapture the glory Monday night than the one who came under
scrutiny for his dedication, preparation, and fragility last season
when his production plummeted from the rookie receiving record (90
receptions) to 27 catches, hardly befitting someone of Superman
status.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, despite the Patriots' 27-21 loss to the Denver
Broncos, Glenn shrugged off first-half rustiness and seemed to do
it all. After missing the first pass of the night, Glenn stepped up
his game. He got open, often leaving his coverage in the dust.
</P>
<P>
   He caught five passes for 71 yards, a decent, not spectucular,
night. But some of the catches that weren't allowed _ a ball thrown
to the corner of the end zone by Drew Bledsoe on which Glenn wasn't
able to keep both feet in bounds (or was he shoved?) in the first
quarter, and a great grab along the sideline on which he was
clearly out in the fourth quarter _ were signatures of the Superman
Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry Glenn can flat out play,'' said veteran Denver safety
Steve Atwater following the game. ``I don't think anyone has seen
the complete player yet, either. This guy is fast, strong, and he
can just leave everybody looking foolish. He's a nightmare for any
cornerback in the league to cover. Usually, one guy can't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the drop, Glenn seemed intent on exorcising all
negative vibes.
</P>
<P>
   There was a TV report that coach Pete Carroll had spoken to
Glenn at halftime about getting into the game. Carroll emphatically
denied that, saying, ``I just wanted him to go out and beat their
corners in the second half. I wasn't disappointed in him at all. I
just wanted him to get open.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn said he never heard any words of criticism from Carroll,
but he certainly wanted to make up for the drop.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe said he wanted to get the ball right back to Glenn, but
he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry was bummed out about the ball he dropped,'' said
Bledsoe. ``Usually, I like to go right back to the receiver after
he's dropped one because I don't want him to linger on anything
negative. But Terry did that on his own. He didn't let it bother
him and couldn't wait to get his hands on the ball again.''
</P>
<P>
   The next time Bledsoe had an opportunity to go to Glenn was in
the second quarter, but Neil Smith was rushing hard and hit the
quarterback's arm, so his pass wasn't catchable.
</P>
<P>
   Shut out in the first half, Glenn and Bledsoe had a little chat.
Bledsoe basically told him he was going to go to him in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn said he spoke to Bledsoe about having room to run after
the catch, and sure enough, the two got together on the first drive
of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things just opened up for me,'' said Glenn. ``We were trying
in both halves, but it just happened that we executed better in the
second half.''
</P>
<P>
   On third and 3 from the New England 34, Bledsoe connected with
Glenn on a 14-yard pass, the receiver making a move on Darrien
Gordon to get open just long enough to make the first-down
reception. From the 48, Bledsoe went right back to Glenn, this time
hitting him on the fly for a 24-yard gain.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' offense shed any rust it might have had in the
first half and went on to score on a 24-yard Bledsoe pass to Troy
Brown, cutting the deficit to 17-14.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just trying to get back into our game, trying to
counter what they had done to us,'' said Glenn. ``I thought the
offense started to do much better. We started to move the ball
downfield, and that's what we can do all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn is earmarked as a big part of the Ernie Zampese offense.
The offensive coordinator would love to get Glenn the ball and then
watch him utilize his speed after the catch. Zampese also believes
the short passing game will open up the long ball. A couple of
times in the exhibition season, Glenn was wide open, but Bledsoe
overthrew him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're just going to get better,'' said Glenn. ``We're
starting to understand how good the system is and how everyone can
benefit by it. Ernie Zampese is a great offensive coordinator. We
all believe in what he's trying to do. It's just a matter of
playing together and getting a little smoother.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the passing game was the best it's been since the
Zampese offense was introduced in training camp. Bledsoe hit 20 of
32 passes for 289 yards, 2 touchdowns, and no interceptions. He
connected on long passes of 55 yards to Shawn Jefferson in the
second quarter and 52 to Troy Brown in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Still missing was a ground game of note. The Patriots managed 81
yards on 24 carries, which was short of their goal of at least 30
carries per game. Because they weren't able to run more and better,
the defense played too long _ 33 minutes 13 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn wasn't pleased with the outcome. He thought the Patriots
were primed to beat the Broncos, but instead, they lost to Denver
for the 11th straight time at Mile High Stadium and the 11th
straight time overall. In his three seasons, Glenn has yet to beat
the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kinds of rivalries are ones you remember all of your
life,'' he said. ``I can go back to Little League _ it seems
there's always one team. At Ohio State, it was Mihcigan. Here it's
the Broncos.''
</P>
<P>
   Respect is important to Glenn. He wants to be respected as a
player, but more important, he wants the team to be respected. John
Elway can say after the game, ``It's good to beat a team of this
caliber because we're probably going to be facing them sometime
later in the season.'' But Glenn wonders whether the Patriots can
be respected if they can't beat the team they so desperately want
to beat.
</P>
<P>
   Do the Broncos respect the Patriots?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not at all,'' said Glenn. ``You lose a ballgame, why
should they respect us? You have to earn that by winning games.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one would have got us rolling. Now we have to start next
week. Every week in the NFL is very important. You can't take
anything for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are heartening words from the man with the ``S'' on his
chest.

MCGWIRE-SOSA CHASE A MARKETING HOME RUN 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the sluggers Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa chase a new Major
League Baseball home run record, companies across the country are
chasing a singular opportunity to attach their products and brand
names to a striking athletic achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not nearly as large as the Super Bowl, of course,'' said
an executive for one of Major League Baseball's largest sponsors.
``But it is close to, and I think will move beyond, any sort of
marketing pitches attached to the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Hampshire manufacturer Pro Player Inc., has already
approached $500,000 in sales of apparel with the image of McGwire,
who tied Roger Maris' single-season record of 61 home runs Monday.
When he breaks the record, the company is set with an immediate
distribution plan that officials say could garner $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the stuff is on the shelf, it is going to sell,'' said Neil
Hernberg, of Pro Player. ``It's a great sign that baseball is back.
It really needed a major injection, and it got it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa is the pitch man for McDonald's in Chicago, and his agents,
at Integrated Marketing Solutions (IMG), say they have more
endorsements in sight.
</P>
<P>
   The players' union, which licenses some products, is feeling the
business impact of the historic on-field performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to have 12 companies licensed to sell official
home run record products, everything from apparel to souvenir
collectibles,'' said Richard White, general manager of licensing
and marketing for the Major League Players Association. ``There
really hasn't been anything like this since Cal Ripken Jr. broke
Lou Gehrig's consecutive game record _ and this is probably going
to be bigger than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had good success over the years, especially with a
player like Ken Griffey Jr., in terms of the sale of products we
license,'' White said. ``But Mark and Sammy are really the two
players in demand, now.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimates vary considerably, in part because the home run race
is unlike most sports events that attract merchandisers and
endorsees, but observers of the collectibles industry say the
market is booming and could generate an extra $30 million to $70
million in sales this year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, companies like Pepsi-Cola Co. and MasterCard
International Inc. hope that promotional campaigns linked to the
home run chase will burnish their brands and make their sponsorship
of Major League Baseball more valuable than at any time since
baseball's most recent nadir, the strike season of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seizing the moment to link our brand to a baseball
event,'' said Jon Harris, a corporate spokesman for Pepsi. ``The
national exposure here is enormous, and it is a perfect opportunity
to launch a major, new campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Corporate sponsors of Major League Baseball and manufacturers
licensed to sell its equipment and souvenirs say that the home run
race is among a series of developments _ like Ripken's consecutive
game record, the construction of new stadiums, the establishment of
expansion teams in new markets, and even the hugely successful
promotional give-aways of Beanie Babies _ that has regenerated
baseball as an attractive marketing and merchandising opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Like other national sponsors of Major League Baseball, Pepsi and
MasterCard had been answering a lot of questions before this season
about whether their investment in the game was worth it. There are
fewer questions now.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been one of the most exciting seasons in baseball
history,'' said Pepsi's Harris. ``And the home run countdown is
just capping it off perfectly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden we have baseball back where it was, if not
better, with its best players capturing the attention of the
nation,'' said Larry Flanagan, the vice-president for advertising
for MasterCard.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi has launched a national promotion called the Pepsi Home
Run Countdown, which includes new television, radio, print and
outdoor advertising, as well as a major in-store, point-of-purchase
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers can guess at the number of home runs the eventual
champion will hit this year and submit an entry to become eligible
for prizes like World Series tickets through 2002 and a lifetime
supply of Pepsi.
</P>
<P>
   A new television commercial, produced by BBDO Worldwide,
features quick shots of McGwire and Sosa belting home runs, to the
jaunty rhythms of the Rossini's ``William Tell Overture''.
</P>
<P>
   MasterCard has incorporated the home run derby into its
``Priceless Memories'' television campaign, produced by
McCann-Erickson.
</P>
<P>
   Again, McGwire and Sosa are shown alternately smashing long
balls into the stands, with the announcer tallying the cost: ``One
major league baseball, nine dollars ...''
</P>
<P>
   When Sosa hits one entirely out of Wrigley Field in Chicago, the
announcer says, ``One windshield, $100.''
</P>
<P>
   Then a ball is shown leaving a park off no one's bat in
particular, and the announcer says, ``Number 62 _ priceless.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The home run race between Mark and Sammy really fits into our
Priceless Memories campaign,'' said MasterCard's Flanagan.
``Personal achievement is truly another thing you can not buy, and
as we like to say, `For the rest, there's MasterCard.'''
</P>
<P>
   At Pro Player, in Hudson, N.H., the preparations began in May,
linked largely to McGwire, whose hot hitting in the first two
months of the season had fans and some companies focusing early on
the home run record.
</P>
<P>
   Pro Player has signed on printing companies in St. Louis, where
McGwire plays, and in other cities where he will play for the rest
of the season, to immediately mass produce hundreds of thousands of
T-shirts licensed by Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got started pretty early, because he started hitting home
runs pretty early,'' Hernberg said. ``We saw this as a tremendous
opportunity, and we started negotiating with his people in May and
then things really took off.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the printing plants and our strategy in place, our goal
is to have people leaving the game at which the record is broken,
and our shirts available for them, right there.''

ZENGA WAY WORKS FOR REVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLESLEY, Mass. _ Walter Zenga has made few changes in two
weeks as coach of the Revolution. But the team's mind-set seems to
have improved after three halves of successful soccer, and its
playoff hopes have been revived.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the situation deteriorates in the final four games,
starting with Saturday's against Columbus, Zenga will be in a
position to be considered at least a mini-miracle worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brought his ideas and a certain professionalism,''
midfielder Edwin Gorter said Tuesday. ``After 20 years of playing
for top teams in the world, you are certainly going to bring
something. What counts in soccer is results, and if we make the
playoffs, Walter will be considered the best coach in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   At least Zenga will have helped break some molds. In Italy,
coaches are required to attend courses which deal with physiology
and psychology as well as tactics. Then they usually start at the
bottom, coaching amateur, youth, or Serie C teams. Even Dino Zoff,
one of the game's legendary figures, had to work with the under-23
team before becoming national team coach.
</P>
<P>
   But Zenga, in many ways the spiritual successor to Zoff as
Italy's national team goalkeeper, has none of the coaching
credentials or licenses. He was simply named Revolution coach,
replacing Thomas Rongen, in a relatively spontaneous ceremony
following the team's tribute to him two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Zenga seems suited for the role.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can a coach who has not played teach someone who has
played for 20 years, won championships, played in the World Cup,
European Championships, Champions Cup?'' Zenga said. ``I can teach
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 20 years, you experience many things. And if you are not
stupid, you learn, and you can put into the locker room and into
the team what you have learned. It's in my character. When I was
playing, I spoke with the players all the time. It is normal for a
goalkeeper to talk, talk, talk, give advice.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, Zenga has reduced some of the tension on the Revolution.
The team had experienced nine-game losing streaks in the last two
seasons, and doubts had increased among the players, who trail
Miami by 6 points for the Eastern Conference's final playoff spot.
Zenga had planned to return next year, resume his playing career,
and be a part of the Revolution's decision-making process.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first idea was for next year to be a player-coach, and I am
working for that,'' Zenga said. ``I think the fans, the Revolution,
the Krafts would be happy if I did that. I hope I can transfer my
personality from the field to the locker room. I wish I could play
now and give the team more confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Zenga was the steadiest of players but also known for his
uninhibited spirit and spontaneity.
</P>
<P>
   ``In practice, in preseason training, you cannot be a free
spirit,'' Zenga said. ``But outside the training, you can be _ if
you stay within the rules, within the guidelines of being a
professional player.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Zenga seemed crazy at times, there was a method to his
madness. He performed for highly respected coaches such as
Sven-Goran Eriksson, Giovanni Trapattoni, and Azeglio Vicini. His
last six games for Italy were shutouts before coach Arrigo Sacchi
had him replaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I contested things in certain situations, yes,'' Zenga said.
``Not for myself but for the team. I had many coaches _ Trapattoni
and Vicini for five years, Eriksson for two years _ and I had
problems with just one coach (Sacchi).
</P>
<P>
   ``My coaches always considered their human relationships most
important. It happens that players don't agree with the coach, they
don't want to stay with the team. That is normal, and it happens
everywhere. That's why I'm not surprised if they say, `Walter, I
don't agree with you.' I first consider the man, then the player.
It's most important to have a good relationship with my teammates.
You have to put yourself in my shoes. There are 21 of us in the
locker room, and it's not an easy situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Zenga played with many of the Revolution players last season,
but he is establishing a different relationship with them now.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I played, we gave the most encouragement to those who
were out of the lineup,'' he said. ``That way, they don't feel
excluded. There is no speaking behind your back. When I was a
player, I gave moral support, encouragement to the players that
needed it. Now I must talk to all the players. And I have a problem
with this because I know what a player feels.''
</P>
<P>
   Zenga certainly knows how to act and talk like a coach.
Discussing the Revolution's 2-0 win over the MetroStars last week,
he said, ``Were we lucky? No. We played New York with good
concentration, personality, pride. New York had no chances in 90
minutes, and we could have scored five times. We played a bad first
half in Miami (a 3-2 loss). The problem was that the players didn't
believe in the possibility of the playoffs. In the second half,
they changed mentality completely. When things go bad, you think
everything will go bad. I didn't change them, they changed. I try
to give them some help and my personal opinions and ideas.''

DEFENSE PUT A STOP TO RUNNING GAME, BUT NOT TO BRONCOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Patriots thought they could win the game by keeping Terrell
Davis in check. They did. But as a result, they allowed John Elway
to cash in for the Broncos' hard-fought 27-21 victory Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   While the Patriots were concentrating on not letting Davis run
over them as he had in the past, Elway won the game.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots fans can beef all they want this morning about dumb
mistakes that hurt their team, but the guy who dominated the game
was Elway.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots challenged him to beat them, and he did.
</P>
<P>
   The first offensive play of the game was a sign. Anticipating
that the Patriots' defense would flow all night toward Davis (22
carries, 75 yards), Elway faked a handoff to Davis going left, kept
the ball, rolled to his right, and drilled a bomb to wide receiver
Ed McCaffrey, who was in a one-on-one situation with cornerback
Chris Canty. The Broncos worked over Canty all night with great
success.
</P>
<P>
   When he was under center, Elway (22 for 34, 257 yards, 1
touchdown, no interceptions) would freeze the secondary with a fake
to Davis, then slice it up with short passes.
</P>
<P>
   His first touchdown pass, which gave Denver a 10-0 lead in the
first period, was a thing of beauty. At the New England l4, Elway
pump-faked a short pass to Rod Smith, looking to his right.
Safeties Lawyer Milloy and Willie Clay bit on the fake. When Elway
brought the ball back down, then up again for the throw, tight end
Shannon Sharpe was behind Milloy to make the touchdown catch.
</P>
<P>
   Though they lost, the Patriots' offense played a good game.
Scoring 21 points against Denver amid ``Monday Night Football''
hoopla in Mile High Stadium was an achievement, even though they
played most of the game without tight end Ben Coates (sprained
ankle), Drew Bledsoe's favorite target.
</P>
<P>
   When Bledsoe (20 for 32, 289 yards, 2 TDs, no interceptions) had
time to throw, which he did on most passing occasions, he was
solid. Denver's weakness is in the secondary. The Broncos do not
cover well. The Patriots' wide receivers have a large edge in
talent over the Denver defensive backs in man-to-man situations.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, Denver did not seem to blitz Bledsoe as much as in
their prior meetings the past three years. Too many times, the
Broncos seemed content to sit in coverage and try to make plays.
When they did, Bledsoe burned them. On the other hand, when they
blitzed, they picked up three sacks on Bledsoe, and in another
half-dozen situations, they forced him to throw prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   Neither team had a good running game. Both teams defended the
run well. Neither secondary plays well man-to-man.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots had a wide edge on special teams, except in field
goals situations. The Broncos made both of their field goal
chances. The Patriots couldn't make good on either of their two. On
the first, Adam Vinatieri simply missed to the right. The second
was blocked by Trevor Pryce, but it was not Vinatieri's fault.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos acted as if they knew they might be able to block a
kick. They positioned defensive end Neil Smith in the gap between
center Mike Bartrum and right guard Dave Wohlabaugh (normally a
center but not the long snapper). For whatever reason, the Patriots
had defensive tackle Chad Eaton lined up at right tackle in the
kick protection formation. At the snap, Smith hit the gap between
center and left guard, getting a double team from Bartrum and
Wohlabugh. Eaton picked up a defensive back to his right coming on
a blitz, allowing Price a clear shot up the middle to block the
kick.
</P>
<P>
   Elway was nearly unstoppable out of the shotgun. When the
Patriots wanted to rush him on third-down passing situations, he
sat in the shotgun and unloaded the ball before the rush could get
to him. His footwork was sensational. From his play-action fakes to
his sliding in the pocket to avoid rushers, he frustrated attempts
to pressure him all night long.
</P>
<P>
   Derrick Cullors had a great night for the Patriots, as did
punter Tom Tupa. The Patriots had a wide edge in field position
because of these two. Tupa outkicked the oppositon all night,
backing up the Broncos with every punt. Cullors was sensational
returning kickoffs and terrific on kick coverage, making three
open-field tackles in those situations.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd had an impact on the Patriots in the third period, and
it cost them near the end of the game. Three times in the third
period when the Patriots had the ball, Bledsoe was forced to call
timeouts when he couldn't get the snap off on time, courtesy of the
NFL's loudest crowd. And because of the noise, it appeared that not
once was he able to change plays at the line. The play called had
to be the one he went with.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' play selection was suspect in the closing minutes.
Down, 27-14, with under six minutes to play and no timeouts, the
Patriots were running out of an I formation instead of spreading
the field and going into the two-minute offense. They got one TD,
but when an onside kickoff attempt failed, the Broncos just sat on
the ball as time ran out.
</P>
<P>
   In losing, the Patriots showed they could play with any team in
the league, anywhere. In winning, the Broncos showed that they can
still move the ball with Elway but their secondary can be
exploited.

GOLF FIRM OPPOSES USGA'S PROPOSED CLUB TEST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the past three months, professional golf has sought to
assuage major equipment manufacturers while devising limits on the
profitable technologies they have produced.
</P>
<P>
   As of Tuesday, it is clear that the manufacturers want no part
it.
</P>
<P>
   Accusing the United States Golf Association of ``political
posturing and obfuscation,'' The Acushnet Co. of Fairhaven, Mass.
has requested the USGA to withdraw a proposed test for golf clubs.
The golf association wants to test the ``spring-like effect'' of
clubs, saying that the rebounding impact propels the ball farther.
</P>
<P>
   Acushnet says there is no such thing.
</P>
<P>
   Other manufacturers, including Acushnet's major competitor,
Callaway Golf, of California, have privately told the USGA that
they are in full agreement with Acushnet, according to sources in
the association and in the $2.5 billion golf equipment industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any company who has as much invested in research and
development as any of the top companies is going to oppose what the
USGA is trying to do,'' said an official of one of the
manufacturers. ``If you take a look at what the market is doing
now, sales have been flat for some time. This would just hurt all
the more.''
</P>
<P>
   The USGA and some other officials fret that golfers are hitting
the ball too far, and that the game is quickly becoming a
drive-and-putt affair with an emphasis on technology.
Manufacturers, meanwhile, spend millions of dollars annually in
research and development in an effort to rush new and improved
products to market.
</P>
<P>
   The USGA issued a protocol in July on the ``spring-like
effect,'' aimed at diffusing a major conflict with the
manufacturers that had been boiling on the eve of the US Open in
June. Manufacturers said they were bracing for major new
regulations severely limiting technological advances and perhaps
even declaring some existing clubs illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The Draconian measures did not eventuate, but the effect and the
industry response was seen by many observers as an attempt to fight
the potentially major battles of tomorrow on a smaller scale, now.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Acushnet objected _ at length and vociferously _ not
only to the specific proposal on ``spring-like effect,'' but to the
USGA's philosophy on technological improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Acushnet not only rejected the assertion that some clubs have a
``spring-like effect,'' it said that no harm to the game has been
identified, regardless. Moreover, the USGA's protocol for measuring
the test is ``scientifically unsound and practically unusable,''
and it has denied the manufacturers due process by providing for
less than 30 days to simulate the testing and otherwise evaluate
the protocol, Acushnet says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our comments are substantial, both in their number and
nature,'' wrote Wally Uihlein, president and chief executive of
Acushnet, in a letter to the USGA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recent events indicate that rule-making activities at the USGA
have taken a political and secretive turn ... '' Uihlein said. ``We
should be able to have a framework for discussing and resolving
issues that transcends the political posturing and obfuscation that
we have recently witnessed.''
</P>
<P>
   John Matheny, senior director of equipment standards for the
USGA, declined to comment on Acushnet's request to withdraw the
test, saying the association only began to review it Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other companies have commented, but we are going to respect
any wishes to maintain that as a private matter until they indicate
they want it public,'' Matheny said. ``All of these matters will be
heard at the meeting on Sept. 28, when the issue will be discussed
further.''

   When Patrick J. McGovern travels abroad to one of his company's
many international divisions, staffers at Boston-based
International Data Group can still get an audience with the
founder. In McGovern's office at the high-tech publishing firm's
headquarters sits a life-sized mannequin in a dark suit, a McGovern
lookalike that listens silently as employees ask its advice. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The mannequin, dubbed McGovern's ``vice president of
listening,'' offers open ears to all. It does plenty of listening,
employees say, because McGovern &UR;  &LR; encourages his &UR;  &LR; staffers to speak
up and act for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   McGovern, 61, who started the privately held company in 1964 and
still owns 75 percent of it, has grounded his 9,000-employee
firm &UR;  &LR; in a philosophy of self-sufficiency. Staffers and outsiders
alike refer to IDG, which says it had $2.05 billion in revenues in
1997, as a ``federation'' _ a collection of business units left to
make their own decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The decentralized way of doing business has helped McGovern
build IDG into an empire of 290 technology magazines and
newsletters, with Computerworld and PC World as flagships. Since
launching Computerworld, one of the world's first computer
magazines, in 1967, McGovern has created a publishing network that
spans 75 countries, including Greenland and even the continent of
Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   So independent are the units within IDG, in fact, that the book
publishing division, IDG Books Worldwide Inc., was spun off in an
initial public offering July 27, leaving the parent company with a
77 percent stake and $38 million in proceeds. The book division,
the first of IDG's subsidiaries to go public, wanted to expand its
popular line of ``...For Dummies'' instruction books beyond the
computer field, a goal sufficiently removed from IDG's focus to
spark the sale.
</P>
<P>
   International Data Corp., the company's market research arm
based in Framingham _ which the company says has annual sales of
$150 million _ is expected to be next in line for an IPO.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at IDC, like those from the book division, proposed
the IPO to corporate headquarters _ proving, McGovern says, that
his people think for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We operate in a very decentralized way,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   While its competitors centralize many back-office functions and
negotiate volume contracts for paper and other magazine supplies,
IDG's head office lets its units do just about everything besides
the tax forms.
</P>
<P>
   Former PC World publisher Patrick Kenealy, a 3-year IDG veteran
who is now the managing general partner of IDG Venture Capital in
San Francisco, says headquarters executives rarely visited the
magazine. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   McGovern himself came four times a year for board meetings, but
didn't try to get involved in the magazine's day-to-day operations,
according to Kenealy, who had joined IDG from competing computer
publisher Ziff-Davis Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an extremely hands-off chairman, a spectacular coach,''
Kenealy says. ``They virtually left us alone.''
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis on internal entrepreneurship within business units
helps reduce turnover as well, company officials say. &UR;  &LR; ``We tend to
have a stable population,'' says Kelly Conlin, president of IDG and
McGovern's number two executive. ``They're very talented people who
are able to run these companies in a very fast-moving fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Conlin first met McGovern while studying at Harvard Business
School, where he read an article about IDG's organizational
principles. Impressed, Conlin called up the chief executive and
struck up an acquaintance that led to his joining McGovern's
decentralized organization.
</P>
<P>
   In the crowded computer-publishing and information sector, IDG
has distinguished itself in recent years by concentrating on the
international arena, with publications in the native languages of
the 75 countries where it operates.
</P>
<P>
   IDG has pushed steadily outward while publicly traded
competitors like New York-based Ziff-Davis, owned by the Japanese
firm Softbank Corp., and CMP Media Inc. of Manhasset, N.Y., have
focused on the domestic market. (Ziff-Davis publishes PC Week while
CMP publishes Information Week.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``Internationally, the biggest player is IDG,'' says Bear
Stearns analyst Kevin R. Gruniech. ``Domestically, it's CMP and
Ziff-Davis.''
</P>
<P>
   The foreign-looking strategy has become somewhat of a cliche at
IDG, spawning new publications notable mainly for their exotic
locations. McGovern recently flew to Antarctica to launch an
on-line Computerworld edition tailored to computer users on the
sparsely-populated southern continent; he claims 20,000 users visit
the Web site each month. The company recently started PC World
Greenland, a print publication.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; McGovern focuses &UR;  &LR; on countries with rapidly &UR;  &LR; increasing
spending on information technology. ``If a country has about $80
million to $100 million a year in spending on computers, it reaches
the critical size and we can start a publication there,'' McGovern
says. ``We're just going down the GNP list.''
</P>
<P>
   The continued spread of IDG's magazines and trade-show business
should propel the firm to $3.5 billion in revenues in 2000,
according to McGovern. His profit goal for 2000 is about 10
percent, after tax.
</P>
<P>
   The empire builder is a &UR;  &LR; man who personally hands out Christmas
cards to every employee in the United States each winter. Employees
and competitors alike credit McGovern with much of IDG's success,
noting his personal charisma and visionary ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Each new business opportunity at IDG, Kenealy says, has to pass
one crucial test: how will it help further the computer revolution?
</P>
<P>
   McGovern's technological roots are deep. While in high
school &UR;  &LR; in the Philadelphia area, McGovern built an unbeatable
tic-tac-toe machine that helped earn him earn a scholarship to the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Today, the chairman &UR;  &LR; can
look out his Back Bay office across the river to the campus of MIT,
of which he is a trustee.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from MIT, McGovern went to work as associate
editor of Computers and Automation, what he calls the first
computer magazine. He founded IDG in 1964 as a market research
company to study computer buying and use patterns. From the
beginning, the company had the word ``international'' in its name.
In 1972, IDG took its business abroad, launching a Japanese
computer magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes 400 list of richest Americans, on which McGovern has
appeared for years, estimated his wealth in 1996 at more than $700
million.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Despite his net worth, McGovern, a resident of New Hampshire
who has four children and is on his second marriage, is known for
eschewing ostentation. He flies coach class and carries his own
briefcase.
</P>
<P>
   But while McGovern is central to IDG's identity, a company's
fate also depends heavily on the state of its industry.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say computer magazine publishers face several key
challenges, including the advent of Internet magazines. ``More and
more people are going to get their information from the Internet
rather than waiting for a daily or weekly magazine to come out,''
says Alan Meckler, who heads Meckler Media Corp., an information
technology company in Westport, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Even when print magazine companies like IDG take their
publications on line, as McGovern has done, they face competition
from upstart Web entrepreneurs: ``The barriers to entry to be an
information provider are so low now,'' Meckler says. ``A lot of
these people creating these informational Web sites are willing to
do it for a nickel an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, McGovern says, 240 of the company's 280 magazines
have Web sites, and IDG is intent on making money from the sites.
</P>
<P>
   But it's unclear how well IDG's efforts have succeeded.
Competitors and outsiders say the Web sites have struggled &UR;  &LR; due to
a dearth of investment and because &UR;  &LR; IDG operates a separate Web
site for each magazine instead of a unified company site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat is not a guy who likes to invest large sums of money,''
says Aaron C. Goldberg, an executive vice president of Ziff-Davis
Market Intelligence in La Jolla, Calif. ``He looks to invest
minimal money in the hope that something big will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg, a 15-year IDG veteran who left the company in 1992 but
still owns stock through the company's employee stock ownership
plan, says IDG's fragmented universe of Web sites dilutes &UR;  &LR; the
on-line magazines' advertising appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens is, instead of having a centralized network
presence, you get no leverage,'' Goldberg says. ``Unfortunately, on
the 'Net IDG is a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   But employees say the success of the Internet magazines is
McGovern's personal quest.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, much at IDG may ride on McGovern personally. He's known
for predicting the course of the information technology wave in
other countries, using his knowledge of how the trend has played
out in the United States. This combination of understanding and
foresight may be his greatest asset, analysts and competitors say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because he's constantly around the world and sees the global
trends, he can say, `I've seen this in 2 or 3 countries and it's
about to happen in China or Korea,''' Kenealy says.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; IDG watchers say it's uncertain what will happen when McGovern
eventually decides to retire, a choice no one expects him to make
anytime soon. Conlin declines to discuss succession plans, but
Goldberg and others say McGovern is likely to retain his position
for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``IDG is Pat McGovern's property and I do not expect Pat will
give up that position without reasonably compelling reasons,''
Goldberg says.

 HIS MAJESTY MARK McGWIRE: THE KING OF CLASS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GWEN KNAPP  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ As soon as he had finished talking to the president
and signing his bat for the Hall of Fame, Mark McGwire walked over
to his locker, swerved around a silver champagne bucket and started
packing his big red duffel bag.
</P>
<P>
   Royals usually have valets for such things, but not the new
home-run king. He requested help only when he realized that he
needed new shoes for the St. Louis Cardinals' road trip. McGwire
was going to Cincinnati. His old shoes were on their way to
Cooperstown, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   He asked a clubhouse attendant to find another pair. The
attendant hollered back across the buzzing room, double-checking:
``You need new shoes?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, please,'' said the king.
</P>
<P>
   Then he went back to folding up his stuff for the trip, as if he
were any other guy, as if Ted Koppel and David Letterman weren't
building their shows around him that night.
</P>
<P>
   His 62nd home run of the 1998 season made him a legend, an
immortal. He couldn't wait to turn himself back into a human. Amid
all the fuss, his head had started exploding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just took four Advil,'' McGwire said as he packed.
</P>
<P>
   He had worked so hard to do everything right. He hit No. 61 on
his father's 61st birthday, hit 62 on the last day of a home stand,
to give the people of St. Louis the celebration they deserved. To
make it happen, he had to go after a low fastball from Cubs pitcher
Steve Trachsel, who was trying to avoid both the strike zone and an
unfortunate place in baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   The home run had none of the majesty of the usual Mac clouts. At
341 feet, it barely cleared the left-field fence. It was the
shortest of all 62. It looked very much like a mortal's home run.
</P>
<P>
   And the run around the bases? Sloppy, awkward, not at all the
stuff of kings. He saw first-base coach Dave McKay, his favorite
batting-practice pitcher, the guy who blew out his arm throwing
heat to McGwire in Oakland, and he went a little crazy. The two
threw themselves at each other in jubilation, and McGwire almost
forgot to touch first base. He had to backtrack to ensure that the
homer wasn't erased.
</P>
<P>
   The flaw only made the moment seem grander. During this home-run
chase, McGwire had one weakness. He hated having the stage to
himself, feeling all those eyes on him. So he insisted on sharing,
on pulling other people into the picture.
</P>
<P>
   He shared with the past (Roger Maris, the late home-run king),
the present (the Cubs' Sammy Sosa) and the future (his son, Matt.)
</P>
<P>
   He beamed whenever Sosa, his slugging sidekick, was around.
After the historic No. 62, Sosa left his post in right field and
joined a celebration in front of the Cardinals' dugout. The St.
Louis players, in a mass around McGwire, parted for Sosa, and
McGwire wrapped the Cubbie in his arms and lifted him up.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's gesture revealed his class. That he knew it would be so
warmly welcomed revealed McGwire's.
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Fame director Don Marr took the bat used by Maris to
club No. 61 to Busch Stadium on Tuesday afternoon. He showed it to
both Sosa and McGwire, let them hold it and take a few swings.
McGwire held the bat against his heart and said: ``I need you with
me tonight, Roger.''
</P>
<P>
   After he had dethroned their father, McGwire climbed over a
railing to dispense hugs to Maris' children. They were shocked to
see this mountainous man coming toward them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a big guy to be jumping into the stands,'' Roger Maris
Jr. said. ``I didn't want to see him get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of Maris' sons had watery eyes. ``That was his special
day today,'' Roger Jr. said. ``I mean, he's out there hitting 62
home runs, it has never been done before. It is Mark McGwire's day
and Mark McGwire's moment, and for him to come over and greet our
family and give us hugs and let us partake in his day the way he
did was just so special. It is a moment we will never forget.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, McGwire turned his weakness into a strength. As a
reluctant public figure, he became the perfect public figure.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Matt became the ultimate antidote to stage fright. At home plate
on Tuesday, McGwire kissed his 10-year-old son in front of the
world, turning an athletic feat into a statement on parenting.
</P>
<P>
   The two took a ride around Busch Stadium together, slapping
hands with the fans from a red 1962 Corvette convertible that the
Cardinals presented after the game. When the White House called,
McGwire made sure that Matt got to talk to the president, too.
</P>
<P>
   The toughest part of the night came when the Cardinals ushered
him up onto a platform for a special postgame ceremony. He thanked
everyone, including ``my wonderful ex-wife and her husband'' _ an
acknowledgment that may be as unique as 62 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   The ham on the stage was the member of the grounds crew who had
tracked down the historic ball. ``Mr. McGwire,'' Tim Forneris, 22,
said into the microphone, ``I think I have something that belongs
to you.''
</P>
<P>
   In theory, Forneris could have made off with the prize, too. But
this home run race has brought out the best in people, and Forneris
was no exception.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire gave every ticketholder a priceless memory. Some of the
details, though, were lost in a haze for him. When he returned to
the dugout after the home run, he said he felt so foggy that he had
to remind himself that he had five innings of baseball left to
play. Manager Tony LaRussa promised him the day off in Cincinnati
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he meant it, because I'm tired,'' McGwire said,
standing at his clubhouse stall.
</P>
<P>
   LaRussa came by and asked whether McGwire was taking the charter
flight with the rest of the Cardinals. The new home run king said
yes and started packing faster.

<TEXT>
<P>
   As the sluggers Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa chase a new Major
League Baseball home run record, companies across the country are
chasing a singular opportunity to attach their products and brand
names to a striking athletic achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not nearly as large as the Super Bowl, of course,'' said
an executive for one of Major League Baseball's largest sponsors.
``But it is close to, and I think will move beyond, any sort of
marketing pitches attached to the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Hampshire manufacturer Pro Player Inc., has already
approached $500,000 in sales of apparel with the image of McGwire,
who tied Roger Maris' single-season record of 61 home runs Monday.
When he breaks the record, the company is set with an immediate
distribution plan that officials say could garner $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the stuff is on the shelf, it is going to sell,'' said Neil
Hernberg, of Pro Player. ``It's a great sign that baseball is back.
It really needed a major injection, and it got it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa is the pitch man for McDonald's in Chicago, and his agents,
at Integrated Marketing Solutions (IMG), say they have more
endorsements in sight.
</P>
<P>
   The players' union, which licenses some products, is feeling the
business impact of the historic on-field performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to have 12 companies licensed to sell official
home run record products, everything from apparel to souvenir
collectibles,'' said Richard White, general manager of licensing
and marketing for the Major League Players Association. ``There
really hasn't been anything like this since Cal Ripken Jr. broke
Lou Gehrig's consecutive game record _ and this is probably going
to be bigger than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had good success over the years, especially with a
player like Ken Griffey Jr., in terms of the sale of products we
license,'' White said. ``But Mark and Sammy are really the two
players in demand, now.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimates vary considerably, in part because the home run race
is unlike most sports events that attract merchandisers and
endorsees, but observers of the collectibles industry say the
market is booming and could generate an extra $30 million to $70
million in sales this year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, companies like Pepsi-Cola Co. and MasterCard
International Inc. hope that promotional campaigns linked to the
home run chase will burnish their brands and make their sponsorship
of Major League Baseball more valuable than at any time since
baseball's most recent nadir, the strike season of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seizing the moment to link our brand to a baseball
event,'' said Jon Harris, a corporate spokesman for Pepsi. ``The
national exposure here is enormous, and it is a perfect opportunity
to launch a major, new campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Corporate sponsors of Major League Baseball and manufacturers
licensed to sell its equipment and souvenirs say that the home run
race is among a series of developments _ like Ripken's consecutive
game record, the construction of new stadiums, the establishment of
expansion teams in new markets, and even the hugely successful
promotional give-aways of Beanie Babies _ that has regenerated
baseball as an attractive marketing and merchandising opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Like other national sponsors of Major League Baseball, Pepsi and
MasterCard had been answering a lot of questions before this season
about whether their investment in the game was worth it. There are
fewer questions now.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been one of the most exciting seasons in baseball
history,'' said Pepsi's Harris. ``And the home run countdown is
just capping it off perfectly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden we have baseball back where it was, if not
better, with its best players capturing the attention of the
nation,'' said Larry Flanagan, the vice-president for advertising
for MasterCard.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi has launched a national promotion called the Pepsi Home
Run Countdown, which includes new television, radio, print and
outdoor advertising, as well as a major in-store, point-of-purchase
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers can guess at the number of home runs the eventual
champion will hit this year and submit an entry to become eligible
for prizes like World Series tickets through 2002 and a lifetime
supply of Pepsi.
</P>
<P>
   A new television commercial, produced by BBDO Worldwide,
features quick shots of McGwire and Sosa belting home runs, to the
jaunty rhythms of the Rossini's ``William Tell Overture''.
</P>
<P>
   MasterCard has incorporated the home run derby into its
``Priceless Memories'' television campaign, produced by
McCann-Erickson.
</P>
<P>
   Again, McGwire and Sosa are shown alternately smashing long
balls into the stands, with the announcer tallying the cost: ``One
major league baseball, nine dollars ...''
</P>
<P>
   When Sosa hits one entirely out of Wrigley Field in Chicago, the
announcer says, ``One windshield, $100.''
</P>
<P>
   Then a ball is shown leaving a park off no one's bat in
particular, and the announcer says, ``Number 62 _ priceless.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The home run race between Mark and Sammy really fits into our
Priceless Memories campaign,'' said MasterCard's Flanagan.
``Personal achievement is truly another thing you can not buy, and
as we like to say, `For the rest, there's MasterCard.'''
</P>
<P>
   At Pro Player, in Hudson, N.H., the preparations began in May,
linked largely to McGwire, whose hot hitting in the first two
months of the season had fans and some companies focusing early on
the home run record.
</P>
<P>
   Pro Player has signed on printing companies in St. Louis, where
McGwire plays, and in other cities where he will play for the rest
of the season, to immediately mass produce hundreds of thousands of
T-shirts licensed by Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got started pretty early, because he started hitting home
runs pretty early,'' Hernberg said. ``We saw this as a tremendous
opportunity, and we started negotiating with his people in May and
then things really took off.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the printing plants and our strategy in place, our goal
is to have people leaving the game at which the record is broken,
and our shirts available for them, right there.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It is the capital's rawest political fight, an
under-the-radar power struggle rife with allegations of Republican
racism and Clinton administration corruption. The Supreme Court
will have to settle it but not before the federal government faces
a possible shutdown over it this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is the 2000 Census.
</P>
<P>
   Strange as it sounds, a decision on how the country gets counted
in 2000 will be one of the key credibility tests for a troubled
President Clinton on Capitol Hill in the coming weeks. Clinton
pledged to House Democrats last month that he would veto any GOP
spending bill this fall that doesn't allow the Census Bureau to
estimate the population it can't actually enumerate in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the president will renege,'' said Representative
Carolyn Maloney, a New Yorker who, like many fellow Democrats from
urban areas, wants the Census Bureau to find better methods for
counting minorities in 2000 than it did in 1990. ``This shouldn't
be political, but right now it is one hot potato.''
</P>
<P>
   The temperature was expected to rise Wednesday (Sept. 9) when
Republicans on the House census subcommittee grilled top officials
of the Commerce Department and Census Bureau on why the Clinton
administration persists in planning for a 2000 Census that includes
statistical ``sampling,'' or estimating, after a federal district
court ruled last month that the method is illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican Congress is opposed to the use of sampling, and
we think the responsible position for the administration is to move
forward without it,'' said Representative Dan Miller, a Florida
Republican who chairs the census subcommittee. ``It's very
frustrating that they want to unilaterally change the way we have
counted people for 200 years for a very high-risk plan that nobody
should trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Acting Census Bureau Director James Holmes said Tuesday that the
2000 Census will be jeopardized if the issue isn't settled by
March. Robert Shapiro, undersecretary of Commerce for economic
affairs, told reporters that without sampling, the projected $4.6
billion census would cost ``substantially more.''
</P>
<P>
   The fuss is more about old-fashioned politics than new math. The
US decennial census, which not only tries to count each of us but
also where we live, determines how the 435 seats in the House will
be divided among the states. No issue is more critical to House
members than whether reapportionment, which follows the census,
will lead to changes in the boundaries and demographics of
districts that have elected them.
</P>
<P>
   Census data also play a big part in the distribution of federal
grant money for everything from highways to Head Start. It amounts
to about $180 billion a year, and legislators care deeply that a
fair share of those dollars come home to their districts.
</P>
<P>
   So do many special-interest groups. Tuesday a coalition of civil
rights activists and advocates for children declared it
``unconscionable'' for politicians to interfere with the planning
of the census. ``They are playing a dangerous game of chicken,''
said Wade Henderson, spokesman for the group and executive director
of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats say they are arguing over how best to
get an accurate census count. According to a bureau analysis, the
1990 enumeration, which cost $2.6 billion, missed some 8 million
people, counted another 4 million twice, and was off by about 10
percent in its US population tally of 246 million. Boston's
population was undercounted by 2.8 percent, the bureau reported.
</P>
<P>
   The error rate, which the bureau said largely results from
undercounting minorities, particularly children, and the rural and
urban poor, was higher in 1990 than it has ever been. Many
statisticians expect even less accuracy in 2000 unless the Census
Bureau supplements its traditional door-to-door and postal count
with a statistical sample that allows it to extrapolate the size
and demographics of the population it misses.
</P>
<P>
   But many Republicans suspect sampling is a Democratic device to
cook the books and increase the count of minorities, particularly
black Americans who overwhelmingly vote Democratic. And some
Democrats just as vehemently accuse Republicans of playing racial
politics by trying to block better census counts that would create
more majority black and Hispanic districts.
</P>
<P>
   GOP officials have estimated that population sampling could
result in redrawing two dozen Republican-held House districts and
losing hundreds of seats in state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Democrats control the model, they will control the
outcome,'' said Peter Cleary, director of the Citizens for an
Honest Count Coalition, a conservative, grass-roots group. ``This
administration's abuses of power are so widespread that there is no
reason to believe it won't be tempted to politicize the census,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans challenged the sampling plan in federal court
and won a significant victory on Aug. 24 when a three-judge panel
agreed that it was illegal under the federal Census Act to base
reapportionment on anything but an actual population enumeration.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich hailed the ruling for exposing ``the
Clinton administration's illegal and unconstitutional scheme to
manipulate our census for the express purposes of political gain.''
Administration officials said they were disappointed by the outcome
but the bureau would continue preparing for a census with sampling.
Last week, the administration appealed the case to the Supreme
Court, hoping for a ruling in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, the only danger of political manipulation comes from
politicians who are interfering in the design of the census and who
directly or indirectly are trying to prevent the bureau from
sampling, which experts conclude is the best way to assure a fair
and accurate count,'' said Shapiro, whose office oversees the
Census Bureau. Shapiro says he expects the Supreme Court to allow
sampling, which would be in line with previous lower court rulings.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they made a deal with Republican
leaders last year to keep the Census 2000 budget intact and allow
sampling studies until the Supreme Court settled the issue. But in
August, the House agreed to fund the bureau for only six months,
prompting the president's threat to veto the $33 billion spending
bill that funds the Commerce, Justice, and State departments and
includes the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Coehlo, a co-chairman and presidential appointee to a
bipartisan US Census Monitoring Board, said Clinton is ``willing to
stand up for what is right'' and will shut down the government when
the fiscal year ends Sept. 30 for the cause of an accurate census.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very bold on the part of Republicans, to say flat out
that they don't want to count certain people, and the reason is
that these people might vote Democratic and turn the House over to
the Democrats,'' said Coehlo, a former Democratic congressman from
California. ``If you are black, Hispanic, Asian, poor, disabled, or
live in a rural area, it's pretty clear the Republicans don't trust
you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Census Monitoring Board's other co-chairman, Republican J.
Kenneth Blackwell, says it is ``unfortunate the race card is being
played by Tony.'' Blackwell, an African-American who is Ohio's
state treasurer, says he opposes sampling and, like other state and
local officials, has better ideas for eliminating the census
undercount, such as improving the Census Bureau's address list and
finding people through administrative documents, like Medicaid
records.
</P>
<P>
   Others have floated the idea of a two-count census: one that
would enumerate for reapportionment, and a second that would count
and sample for allocating federal funds. Civil rights groups are
very cool to two counts, and Shapiro said it would be ``difficult''
to justify.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find the inside-the-Beltway political gamesmanship amusing
some of the time, but mostly disillusioning,'' Blackwell said.
``The overriding need in the 2000 Census is a healthy dose of
transparency and a little less time spent in the search for Oz.''
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau is an unlikely agency to be caught in such a
swirl of controversy. Its professionalism is renowned, its data are
prodigious and widely accepted, and its reputation is as perhaps
the most apolitical agency in the federal bureaucracy. According to
Pat Cantwell, a statistician for the bureau, scientific sampling
not only is very much in the demography mainstream but also has
been used to a small extent in past census counts.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the census's planned combination of enumeration and
estimation _ some 90 percent of the population will be counted, 10
percent would be extrapolated from a survey of households in all
census blocks _ was recommended to the bureau by a blue-ribbon
panel convened by the nonpartisan National Academy of Sciences in
the wake of the 1990 undercount. Economist Charles L. Schultze, who
headed the panel, says delays caused by political fights, not
sampling, are jeopardizing the 2000 Census.
</P>
<P>
   ``The census is the biggest nondefense operation that the
government runs, and by this time it should have its ducks in a
row,'' Schultze said. ``I'm all for sampling, for saving money, and
getting an accurate count, but right now, I think they just better
decide what we're going to do and get moving.''

GOLF FIRM OPPOSES USGA'S PROPOSED CLUB TEST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the past three months, professional golf has sought to
assuage major equipment manufacturers while devising limits on the
profitable technologies they have produced.
</P>
<P>
   As of Tuesday, it is clear that the manufacturers want no part
it.
</P>
<P>
   Accusing the United States Golf Association of ``political
posturing and obfuscation,'' The Acushnet Co. of Fairhaven, Mass.
has requested the USGA to withdraw a proposed test for golf clubs.
The golf association wants to test the ``spring-like effect'' of
clubs, saying that the rebounding impact propels the ball farther.
</P>
<P>
   Acushnet says there is no such thing.
</P>
<P>
   Other manufacturers, including Acushnet's major competitor,
Callaway Golf, of California, have privately told the USGA that
they are in full agreement with Acushnet, according to sources in
the association and in the $2.5 billion golf equipment industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any company who has as much invested in research and
development as any of the top companies is going to oppose what the
USGA is trying to do,'' said an official of one of the
manufacturers. ``If you take a look at what the market is doing
now, sales have been flat for some time. This would just hurt all
the more.''
</P>
<P>
   The USGA and some other officials fret that golfers are hitting
the ball too far, and that the game is quickly becoming a
drive-and-putt affair with an emphasis on technology.
Manufacturers, meanwhile, spend millions of dollars annually in
research and development in an effort to rush new and improved
products to market.
</P>
<P>
   The USGA issued a protocol in July on the ``spring-like
effect,'' aimed at diffusing a major conflict with the
manufacturers that had been boiling on the eve of the US Open in
June. Manufacturers said they were bracing for major new
regulations severely limiting technological advances and perhaps
even declaring some existing clubs illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The Draconian measures did not eventuate, but the effect and the
industry response was seen by many observers as an attempt to fight
the potentially major battles of tomorrow on a smaller scale, now.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Acushnet objected _ at length and vociferously _ not
only to the specific proposal on ``spring-like effect,'' but to the
USGA's philosophy on technological improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Acushnet not only rejected the assertion that some clubs have a
``spring-like effect,'' it said that no harm to the game has been
identified, regardless. Moreover, the USGA's protocol for measuring
the test is ``scientifically unsound and practically unusable,''
and it has denied the manufacturers due process by providing for
less than 30 days to simulate the testing and otherwise evaluate
the protocol, Acushnet says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our comments are substantial, both in their number and
nature,'' wrote Wally Uihlein, president and chief executive of
Acushnet, in a letter to the USGA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recent events indicate that rule-making activities at the USGA
have taken a political and secretive turn ... '' Uihlein said. ``We
should be able to have a framework for discussing and resolving
issues that transcends the political posturing and obfuscation that
we have recently witnessed.''
</P>
<P>
   John Matheny, senior director of equipment standards for the
USGA, declined to comment on Acushnet's request to withdraw the
test, saying the association only began to review it Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other companies have commented, but we are going to respect
any wishes to maintain that as a private matter until they indicate
they want it public,'' Matheny said. ``All of these matters will be
heard at the meeting on Sept. 28, when the issue will be discussed
further.''

THE GOOD SHIP CLINTON IS TILTING AND MIGHT CAPSIZE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Sept. 13)   (For Use By New York Times News Service Clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bill Clinton must now know how it felt to be
captain of the Titanic, standing lonely and desolate on the bridge
of his mighty ship on a black April night as it began its
relentless descent to the floor of the frigid Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The captain had two options: He could go down with the great
vessel or plunge into the freezing ocean. Either way, doom was his
destiny.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has three options: He can suffer through an impeachment
process with the expectation that the Republican-controlled Senate
would convict him and cast him out of the White House. He can
endure the humiliation of congressional censure and serve out his
term with his authority and prestige sharply diminished. He can
resign as did Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   No matter which option he takes, his presidency _ like the life
of the Titanic captain _ would appear doomed. It is hard to believe
that the ``comeback kid'' has yet another political reincarnation
in his repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   Despite many achievements and good works, Clinton will be
remembered by future generations for the scandal that decimated his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   After the November elections, he almost certainly will face
larger and more assertive Republican majorities in the House and
Senate and, therefore, will find it far more difficult to govern.
</P>
<P>
   Bipartisan leaders of the House, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich
(R) and Minority Leader Dick Gephardt (D), vowed last week to keep
politics out of the impeachment process. But politics already has
begun to run amuck on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   A number of members of Congress, along with some Republicans who
aspire to the presidency in 2000, already have decreed that the
president is guilty and that he must either resign or be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   Almost anything Clinton does in foreign affairs will be suspect.
Should he find it necessary to resort to military action against
Iraq, North Korea or some other outlaw nation, critics will brand
his action as a cynical effort to shift emphasis away from his
domestic troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Abandoned by old Democratic shipmates, attacked by Republican
foes, diminished by his belated confession of immoral and improper
conduct, engulfed in a mood of depression, the president knows that
peril lies ahead when Congress and the public digest Ken Starr's
indictment of the president's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   The self-inflicted tragedy of the 42nd president of the United
States is now reaching its wrenching denouement. It is a somber
drama that in centuries past might have been written by Sophocles,
Shakespeare or Ibsen. In this century, it might have come from the
typewriter of Eugene O'Neill or Arthur Miller.
</P>
<P>
   It is the sad tale of what might have been, of hope, opportunity
and potential lost. It focuses on a personable, extremely bright
man who wanted to be a great president but was victimized by his
own weaknesses and his own low moral and ethical standards.
</P>
<P>
   In Act One, we watched the charming young governor of Arkansas
seeking erratically to come to grips with the powers of the
presidency. He struggled with foreign policy decisions in Somalia,
Bosnia and Haiti. In a period of unparalleled prosperity, he tried
to install a massive health care plan reminiscent of government
reforms adopted in the darkest days of the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   We learned something of his character and his grasp of
responsibility from revelations about Whitewater, the mishandling
of the White House travel office and the transfer to the
presidential mansion of hundreds of FBI files on individuals who
had served in the Reagan and Bush administrations.
</P>
<P>
   But we also learned after the Republican triumph in 1994 that he
is a man of remarkable resilience, who is brilliant at converting
defeat into victory.
</P>
<P>
   When the curtain fell on Act One, Clinton had staged a
sensational comeback and won a stunning reelection victory in 1996
over one of the most formidable Republicans of this era, Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Act Two introduced us to Monica Lewinsky and a sordid episode
that totally overshadowed his achievements in other areas. But
during that period, he signed into law the first balanced budget in
30 years, helped impose a cease-fire in Bosnia and obtained a peace
agreement in Northern Ireland, and fought valiantly for improved
education and health care, a more pristine environment, better race
relations, the protection of Social Security and Medicare and, of
course, a surging economy.
</P>
<P>
   As Act Two ended, Clinton participated in two totally disparate
events abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, he and Boris Yeltsin staged a pathetic charade which
was billed as a Russo-American summit. In reality, it was possibly
the last meeting between two lame ducks who may soon be forced from
office.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, it is the economy that is disintegrating; in America,
it is Clinton's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   From Moscow, Clinton then flew to Ireland, where he was greeted
like a combination of Saint Patrick and Saint George. When he urged
the Irish to hold fast to the peace agreement signed by Catholics
and Protestants on Good Friday, the adoring crowd demonstrated its
agreement with a resounding volley of cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Now we have entered Act Three and the Clinton tragedy is moving
into its final phase. The basic architect of the destruction of the
Clinton presidency is Clinton himself. It is he who failed to
demonstrate his understanding that a president must adhere to high
moral and ethical standards because to millions and millions of
people in this country and around the world, he is the living
personification of America.

 &HT;    SPRAWL THREATENS ENVIRONMENT, REPORT WARNS
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A national conservation group warned Wednesday that
in cities across the nation, the environment and quality of life
are threatened by urban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of World War II, the American Dream has included a
house in the suburbs, and middle-class families have abandoned the
cities ``for greener pastures in suburbia,'' the report said. ``Now
we are running out of greener pastures and many Americans consider
overdevelopment _ sprawl _ to be the fastest growing threat to
their local environment and quality of life.''
</P>
<P>
   The report describes ``sprawl'' as strip commercial developments
along highways and large-lot residential subdivisions spreading out
over what was once farmland or forests.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta was ranked first among the 10 large cities whose quality
of life and environment are most threatened by sprawl, said the
report, titled ``The Dark Side of the American Dream: The Costs and
Consequences of Suburban Sprawl.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta is one of the fastest growing regions in the country,
and the environmental impacts of unplanned sprawl in the Atlanta
area are among the most significant in the nation,'' said the
analysis of data from the U.S. Census Bureau, U.S. Highway
Department, the American Farmland Trust and the Texas
Transportation Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Atlanta, the large cities _ population over 1 million
_ most threatened by sprawl are St. Louis, Washington, Cincinnati,
Kansas City, Denver, Seattle, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Fort Lauderdale
and Chicago, according to the Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   The medium-sized cities (population 500,000 to 1 million) most
threatened by sprawl are Austin, Orlando, Las Vegas, West Palm
Beach and Akron, the report said. The five most threatened small
cities (population 200,000 to 500,000) are McAllen, Texas; Raleigh,
N.C.; Pensacola, Fla.; Daytona Beach, Fla., and Little Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sprawl is more than just an eyesore across our countryside,''
the report said. ``Sprawl contributes to increasing costs for
public services, the declining health of central cities,
environmental degradation and loss of farmland, and a degraded
quality of life.''
</P>
<P>
   The report warned that ``every hour of every day'' the nation
loses 45.6 acres of its best farmlands to subdivisions, shopping
centers, strip malls and roadways. That's about 400,000 acres of
farmland a year that are developed.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club is a national, non-profit advocacy group for
environmental causes.

   BURNING-THE-PRAIRIE (Grayslake, Ill.) _ Sometime this autumn,
after the nesting birds have migrated, the residents of Prairie
Crossing will go for the burn. Equipped with water tanks and
``flappers'' _ special rubber mats for tamping down flames _ they
will leave quaint new houses named for Illinois settlers to partake
in a novel suburban ritual: burning the prairie. The maverick 3
1/2-year-old development is the first major prairie reconstruction
in a residential development and perhaps the most visible symbol
yet of the popular reemergence of the Midwestern prairie, the
oceanic grassland Walt Whitman called North America's most
characteristic landscape. By Patricia Leigh Brown.
</P>
<P>
   HOLTZMAN-NEST (New York) _ Joseph Holtzman, the editor of Nest,
the artsy new journal of decor and interiors, does have a few
things in common with his editorial peers, the tough-as-nails
sheltertrixes at House and Garden, Elle Decor and Architectural
Digest. He, too, knows what he likes and he goes after it
ruthlessly. But any similarity between him and them ends right
about the point where Holtzman _ during an afternoon spent scouting
projects for the magazine _ pauses outside a limestone-faced
maisonette on the Upper East Side where, he said, the writer
William F. Buckley lives. Holtzman has an outsider's view of decor
_ in this case, literally. Nose to the window, he contemplated how
a Peeping Tom style photo shoot chez Buckley would go. ``The lights
are on,'' he said, peering in. ``It would be interesting to see
what kinds of endangered species he's got scattered around in
there.'' By David Colman.
</P>
<P>
   NY-BUYING-APARTMENTS (New York) _ Elliot Gold said it was time
his son, Shawn, 24, a marketer at J.P. Morgan, got his own
apartment. ``He was hanging around at home, making us crazy,''
joked Gold, 47. ``Enough was enough.'' His wife, Sharon Gold, said
that because the rents in Manhattan were ridiculously high, the
only thing that made sense was to buy. So last month, the Golds
helped to buy their son a two-bedroom duplex on that he plans to
share with a roommate _ one floor down from a young woman whose
parents bought her an apartment, and down the hall from a young man
whose parents helped him buy one. By Tracie Rozhon.
</P>
<P>
   SUBURBAN-SPRAWL (Undated) _ ``I love sprawl!'' claimed Susan
Nigra Snyder, a Philadelphia architect having lunch with a klatch
of design academics at the University of Pennsylvania. Defiant, she
paused for the horrified reaction she's come to expect. Indeed, the
eating stopped. Hearing an architect swoon over suburban sprawl is
the same as watching a chef pour Cheeze Whiz over a plate of
quenelles. Creative, you think, but alarmingly tacky. But what Ms.
Snyder really deplores is all the deploring. For decades, her
fellow designers have been so busy hating America's goofy suburban
image, judging it by its esthetic form, they have not dared to
venture forth and figure it out. By Barbara Flanagan.
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Garden questions answered. By Dora
Galitzki.
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE-APARTMENTS (New York) _ Bored to tears by endless
cocktail party speculation about whether the gyrating stock market
will tarnish the value of $10 million Park Avenue apartments? Take
that ennui right over to the Champs-Elysees and buy the same-size
prewar palace for a (relative) chanson _ significantly less than it
would cost in Manhattan. By Tracie Rozhon.
</P>
<P>
   INSTANT-IVY (Undated) _ Not since the 1920s has the New York
region witnessed estate-building on the scale and pace of the late
1990s. These aren't the dinky 10,000-square-foot McMansions that
are crowding the suburbs; they're serious turn-of-the-21st-century
manor houses of 15,000, 25,000 and 40,000 squre feet and more. One
problem with the new estates, however, is that they seem so, well,
new. Because, as more and more well-heeled homeowners are
discovering, you can simply pay architects, contractors and
landscapers to make the places look as if they've been there
forever. One popular 1990s makeover is instant ivy implants. By Tom
Connor.

   MIAMI _ Colombia may have devalued its currency, and Venezuela's
leading presidential candidate may be a retired army colonel whose
greatest claim to fame is a failed coup attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when it comes to South America, all eyes are on Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   With an economy that accounts for some 45 percent of Latin
America's gross domestic product, Brazil will determine how the
rest of the region fares in the face of global turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Brazil were to devalue its currency, it would be
catastrophic,'' said Don Bowler, regional director for Latin
America for the Economist Intelligence Unit in London, an economic
research company. ``The result would be a domino effect throughout
the entire region.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia's devaluation has spread panic in emerging markets
worldwide, helping to create one of Brazil's worst financial crises
in recent years. Local share prices in Brazil have fallen to their
lowest levels in nearly three years.
</P>
<P>
   Economists have trimmed growth estimates for all of Latin
America, particularly for next year. Average growth for the region
in 1999 is now expected to be about 1.8 percent, compared to 3
percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But in an effort to skirt a possible recession, Brazil's
government announced emergency spending cuts this week, and also
said it would ask Congress to approve a plan to halve a gaping
budget deficit over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   About $3.42 billion will be slashed from social and
infrastructure spending this year, and more cuts are planned in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   The deficit, now 7 percent of gross domestic product, is
considered to be the Achilles heel of Brazil's economic recovery
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, to defend its currency _ the real _ and stem the
flood of capital flight, Brazil's Central Bank raised interest
rates from 20 to 30 percent last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current international context of turbulence and
uncertainty of a kind the world has not seen for 10 years requires
a firm and determined response from Brazil,'' said Finance Minister
Pedro Malan.
</P>
<P>
   Because Latin America _ including Mexico, Central and South
America _ accounts for nearly a fifth of U.S. exports, the United
States has a particularly keen interest in the region's fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Like soft parents, the United States has lent lavishly to Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. banks have outstanding loans of nearly $16 billion in
Brazil, more than twice their exposure to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   And at the same time, American mutual funds have also been
exuberant buyers of equities in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are watching Brazil because of the tequila effect that
can happen when a crisis hits such a major economy,'' said Michael
Connolly, professor of international economics at the University of
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that the fundamentals of the Brazilian economy are
still pretty sound,'' he added. ``Brazil (has) dismissed employees
in the public sector and privatized to get revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   When Mexico sharply devalued its peso in December 1994, it set
off an economic downturn in other countries that cut U.S. exports
and hammered U.S. investors.
</P>
<P>
   Troubles in Brazil today would portend troubles in other
countries as well. Argentina, for example, relies on Brazil to buy
about a third of its exports.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the region is in a precarious position.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia, which also has a large deficit, ignored the appeals of
outside governments and devalued its currency by 9 percent last
week.
</P>
<P>
   And investors are looking warily at Venezuela, where Hugo
Chavez, who led a failed coup attempt in 1992 and who has talked of
freezing foreign debt payments, is poised to win December's
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to avoid a devaluation, the Central Bank in Brazil has
been using its own supply of foreign currency to buy up the surplus
of reals to support the currency's buying power in the global
arena.
</P>
<P>
   But this kind of action works only if the Central Bank doesn't
run out of so-called reserve currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's reserves have dropped to an estimated $59 billion,
compared with $69 billion in early August. While this represented a
nasty drop, it was still much more than Russia's $11 billion in
reserves.
</P>
<P>
   In general, economists have praised the austerity measures
introduced by Brazil's President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who's
favored to win presidential elections on Oct. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso has pushed much _ although not all _ of his economic
package through Congress over the past year. Reforms include
spending cuts, government layoffs and tax increases designed to
appease nervous investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that the effect of international turmoil in Brazil
is more psychological than real,'' said Gary Williams, an expert on
Latin America at Texas A&AMP;M University. ``While the rate of growth
will be slower in coming years, there won't be any other major
impact.''

ARIZONA MAN LEAVES MEXICO JAIL 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - A Scottsdale, Ariz., businessman who spent 47 days in
a Mexican jail for taking ammunition across the border has been
released, Mexican officials say.
</P>
<P>
   James Brunen, 45, was arrested by Mexican customs officials in
Nogales, Sonora, on July 23. They said he failed to declare 149
rounds of ammunition that they found in his vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope people now understand that there are laws against
bringing weapons and ammunition into Mexico,'' said Roberto
Rodriguez, Mexico's consul in Nogales, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said a Superior Court magistrate in Hermosillo,
Sonora's capitol, ordered Brunen's release late Tuesday. Brunen had
to fill out procedural paperwork at the Nogales jail and the
immigration office before he could go home, Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Brunen had a hearing Monday on a defense motion to dismiss the
charges against him, Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The magistrate had the latitude to analyze the different
angles of this case, much more so than the judge who sent Mr.
Brunen to jail,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Brunen had gone to Nogales to buy decorative pots for friends
and said he had removed a weapon from his vehicle before leaving
Scottsdale. He said he had forgotten that he had the rounds for
9mm, .38-caliber and .380-caliber weapons in the back.
</P>
<P>
   Brunen said he suddenly remembered the ammo while stopped at the
Mexican customs station. He said he tried to tell the Mexican
customs officials in broken Spanish that he was declaring the
bullets.
</P>
<P>
   But Gilberto Chontal Maldonado, a Mexican customs officer, said
Brunen stated that he couldn't remember whether he had any
ammunition with him. Chontal said customs officials found a holster
behind the driver's seat before finding the ammunition in the back
of the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   During his incarceration, Brunen complained of appalling
conditions in the jail, which he described as overcrowded and
infested with rats and cockroaches. He also urged U.S. shoppers to
boycott Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said that Brunen had the misfortune of getting a judge
with a strict interpretation of Mexican law. Another judge had
quickly released a former Nogales, Ariz., police officer under
almost identical circumstances shortly before Brunen's arrest,
Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 U.S. citizens are being held in border-city jails
for running afoul of Mexican weapons laws.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said the strict laws were passed last year. &QL;

SO MUCH FOR INNOVATION: V-CHIP CREATES NOTHING BUT STATIC  
 (THIS EDITORIAL APPEARED IN THE AUG. 9 ARIZONA REPUBLIC) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - The V-chip is a technological innovation that, we were
assured by broadcasters, Hollywood moguls and the Clinton
administration, would allow television viewers to be warned about
violent and sexual content of television programs.
</P>
<P>
   Then, through the wonders of the microchip, viewers could
automatically block the shows that were likely to offend them. For
this system to work, broadcasters and the entertainment industry
had to create a rating system that included ratings for violence,
sexual content, obscene language, suggestive dialogue and fantasy
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it seems that this little technological marvel of a V-chip
might be just a little too talented for the broadcasters. Giving
parents a choice of what to block on their television set might
also include the option of blocking news, sports, commercials and
other unrated programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoa,'' say the broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe in parental choice, and all that good stuff, but,
come on, there ought to be limits.''
</P>
<P>
   And, apparently, limiting potential revenue-generating material
from the eyes and ears of viewers goes beyond the pale. This here
V-chip is a little too accommodating for its own good.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported not long ago that RCA and
Panasonic want to build V-chips into their sets, enabling viewers
to block, well, pretty much whatever they want.
</P>
<P>
   To counter this, broadcasters are telling TV manufacturers that
they might boycott the V-chip by refusing to electronically code
shows with ratings information _ information necessary for the
V-chip to recognize a particular rating.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to predict how all of this will sort out.
However, it is probably safe to predict that broadcasters,
Hollywood moguls and the Clinton administration will be more
skeptical in the future when someone says, ``Hey, here's a little
device that can solve everyone's problems with television.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless, of course, that device is a sledgehammer. &QL;

 &HT;    LAWYERLY AUTHOR TO WRITE STARR REPORT
 &HT;    Eds: This article is part of a five-story package on impeachment
for use in connection. The articles are IMPEACH-HYDE,
IMPEACH-LEGAL, IMPEACH-POLITICAL, IMPEACH-PROCESS and
IMPEACH-BATES.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To write the investigative report to Congress that
the world is waiting to read, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr has
turned to a soft-spoken literary lawyer who shares his smalltown
Texas roots.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the hard-bitten, career prosecutors who make up most of
the team that has investigated President Clinton for four years,
Stephen Bates was recruited as much for his talents as a scholarly
wordsmith as for his legal skills as a Harvard-educated attorney.
The author of several non-fiction books and an editor of the
``Wilson Quarterly,'' a serious cultural journal, Bates is hard at
work on a massive document that is expected to include explicit
details about Clinton's sexual affair with Monica Lewinsky in
making a case for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very well qualified to write the report,'' said Lynn Chu,
a New York literary agent who represents Bates, as well as Starr
and House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga. ``He's a terrific lawyer and
a really good writer.''
</P>
<P>
   At 40, Bates is about a decade younger than his boss, but they
have similar backgrounds. While Starr grew up in the tiny Texas
town of Vernon, Bates was reared in Pecos, a dusty agricultural
community of 12,000 souls about 200 miles east of El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what propelled his son from the West Texas prairie to the
nation's capital, Bob Bates declared ``sheer talent.'' But that's
about all the friendly fertilizer dealer would allow. His son has
asked his family not to talk to reporters, the elder Bates
explained, lest they unwittingly provide ammunition to the ``White
House attack dogs'' eager to discredit Starr's investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a low-profile type anyway,'' Bob Bates said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Stephen Bates did not return phone calls or reply to
e-mail seeking information for this story.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very soft-spoken. Middle of the road politically. Really
smart,'' said Chu. ``He's not going to make any mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   The prose about Clinton will likely stretch 300 pages or more
and will probably be presented to the House of Representatives
within weeks. Along with charges of perjury and obstruction of
justice, it is expected to include embarrassing details of
Clinton's sexual relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In a televised address to the nation, Clinton maintained he has
been ``legally accurate'' in denying a sexual relationship with the
25-year-old former White House intern. So prosecutors aim to show
that activities in a hideaway off the Oval Office meet the
definition of sex outlined in Clinton's deposition in the separate
Paula Jones sexual harassment suit. Using Lewinsky's testimony
about specific sex acts, Starr's team will try to prove Clinton
committed perjury in the deposition and perhaps later when
testifying before a federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Bates and other members of Starr's team are expected to use
lawyerly language to tone down this tawdry tale.
</P>
<P>
   The writing has been underway for months. Bates began working in
the Office of the Independent Counsel in 1995. He is a graduate of
Harvard College and Harvard Law School, but has made his mark more
as an author than as an attorney.
</P>
<P>
   His 1993 book, ``Battleground,'' told the story of a
fundamentalist Christian mother's crusade to shield her children
from schoolbooks that she said promoted satanism and evolution. The
case grew into the so-called Scopes II trial in East Tennessee and
attracted publicity minded lawyers from national advocacy groups
like the conservative Concerned Women for America and the liberal
People for the American Way.
</P>
<P>
   Legal Times credited Bates with a ``beautifully researched and
meticulously balanced account of the case.''
</P>
<P>
   His other books include ``If No News, Send Rumors: Anecdotes of
American Journalism,'' ``The Media and Congress'' and ``The Spot:
The Rise of Political Advertising on Television.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past decade, he has also been a prolific provider of
magazine articles on an assortment of subjects. He has
</P>
<P>
   written for publications ranging from The National Journal to TV
Guide and Playboy on topics varying from the Constitution to
cyberspace. Last year, however, Bates and Starr struck out when
they tried to interest publishers in a jointly written, scholarly
book on the separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   Although Time magazine reported that Bates considers himself a
``lapsed Episcopalian,'' he grew up in a Bible Belt town where
Baptists fill the most pews on Sundays. Pecos is known for its
irrigated fields of cantaloupes and claims to be the ``Home of the
World's First Rodeo.'' The region's best known citizen, the
mythical cowboy Pecos Bill, rode a cyclone to his final glory and
is commemorated in a downtown museum that also features a replica
of Judge Roy Bean's saloon. Pecos is a town where a bookish boy
might take a backseat to the high school football players in their
letter jackets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve was different...almost like a nerd. Some people gave him
a hard time,'' recalled Cookie Cannon, who along with Bates, was
among the 200 members of the Pecos High School Class of 1976. ``He
was a memorable character ...extremely intelligent. But he didn't
seem to care about grades all that much.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve had a sister named Suzanne, but called Suky, who is the
same age as my younger sister,'' she said. And the Bates family was
well off, living ``on what we called Silk Stocking Road at the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Cannon said she and Bates worked on
the annual staff and played in the high school band. ``He did
literary stuff. He was very smart,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did not arrive at Harvard as an urban sophisticate,'' said
Abigail Thernstrom, who taught Bates in a freshman political
science seminar on constitutional law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known Stephen for over 20 years,'' she said. ``He was a
wonderful student. He's a gentleman out of the Old School. He's a
very strong writer with a very nuanced voice. There's not a
strident bone in him. He's not an ideologue.''
</P>
<P>
   Thernstrom and her husband, Stephan,(CQ) are the authors of the
book, ``America in Black and White: One Nation Indivisible,'' which
criticizes granting preferences based on race or sex. She had a
televised run-in with Clinton during a town hall meeting on race in
Akron, Ohio, in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a very good conversation with the president at that
time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Thernstrom has remained friends with Bates over the decades and
praises his talents.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a gorgeous writer,'' she said. ``Politically, he's very
careful. He sees all sides of everything. ...Judge Starr has a
prize.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from law school, Bates was a clerk for U.S.
Appeals Court Judge James Buckley in Washington and has been a
fellow at several think tanks, including the American Enterprise
Institute, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and
the Annenberg Washington Center.
</P>
<P>
   He lives in suburban Silver Spring, Md., with his wife, Polly,
and their daughter, Charlotte.

 &HT;    JUDICIARY CHAIRMAN HYDE IS RESPECTED ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE
 &HT;    Eds: This article is part of a five-story package on impeachment
for use in connection. The articles are IMPEACH-HYDE,
IMPEACH-LEGAL, IMPEACH-POLITICAL, IMPEACH-PROCESS and
IMPEACH-BATES.
 &HT;    By MACON MOREHOUSE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Henry Hyde still vividly remembers the most
frightening day in his life.
</P>
<P>
   In 1945, he was a 20-year-old Navy ensign skippering an
amphibious boat in the South China Sea. The boat was tied up to a
grounded freighter when a typhoon struck and ``the sky and the
ocean turned solid green. The waves, man, they were 25 feet high. I
was slapping against the freighter like this _ slap, slap, slap,''
he says, his hand hitting the desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``You thought you were going to die any minute. My knees turned
to water.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we going to make it?'' his worried crew asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, sure, we'll be fine,'' Hyde reassuringly replied.
</P>
<P>
   Now, half a century later, he appears equally calm in turbulent
political waters.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, the Chicago-area
Republican is poised to take center stage in the most politically
charged event since Watergate. He would preside over hearings on
whether to impeach President Clinton if House leaders decide to
hold such hearings after independent counsel Kenneth Starr delivers
evidence of Clinton's alleged wrongdoing to the House.
</P>
<P>
   This time, instead of high seas and rocks, Hyde will have to
brace himself against a storm of personal attacks and political
arm-twisting, warns former Rep. Peter J. Rodino, D-N.J. He should
know: in 1974, Rodino ran the impeachment hearings on President
Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   It is a voyage that friends, and even political foes, say Hyde
is eminently suited for.
</P>
<P>
   The once-muscular college basketball player with jet black hair
who used sharp elbows to get his way has mellowed at age 74 into a
white-maned, corpulent statesman who uses soft words and courtly
manners to persuade others.
</P>
<P>
   While he is considered one of the more conservative members of
Congress _ he made his reputation with the ``Hyde amendment''
barring the use of federal funds for abortions and by defending the
Reagan administration during the Iran-contra affair _ acquaintances
also say he is thoughtful and deeply respectful of the institution
of government. They say that if anyone can impose judicial calm on
a the fierce partisan bickering and name-calling that have marked
the Clinton investigation so far, Hyde can.
</P>
<P>
   Daily, Hyde's office gets dozens of calls, some of which he
returns, from people angry that he hasn't already started
impeachment hearings and accusing him of being in the president's
pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Some high-ranking House Republicans are insisting that Congress
stay in session to hear evidence against Clinton instead of
adjourning to campaign for the fall elections. But Hyde, after
first letting the word ``impeachment'' slip from his lips in a CNN
interview in January, has stepped back and even cautioned other
House members to ``keep your mind open and your mouth shut.''
</P>
<P>
   He clearly has taken his own advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never brings it up and I don't ask him,'' said his best
pal, Norman ``Hots'' Michels, a Chicago bar piano player who has
known Hyde for 47 years.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when pressed on the topic, Hyde offers bland,
noncommittal answers. ``We have to wait and see what (Starr)
produces and then we'll do the proper thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may well be that I will act like a judge, weighing evidence
produced by the independent counsel's office, and if I indicate any
biases, our whole process will be tainted and we won't accomplish
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were on trial anywhere in America, that is the kind of
judge you would want, someone who is not tipping their hand,'' said
Rep. Jesse L. Jackson Jr., D-Ill., who rarely agrees with Hyde on
the issues but respects his ``integrity'' and his ``voice of
reason.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not looking for a place in history,'' Jackson added.
``He already has a place in history.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger of Henry Clay and Monica Hyde's two children, young
Hank grew up a Catholic Democrat in Chicago during the Depression.
His father never lost his job collecting nickels from pay phones,
but his wages were cut drastically, and the family moved from their
home in the leafy North Shore suburb of Evanston to an apartment
over a bar, where they ate chop suey almost every night.
</P>
<P>
   He worked his way through St. George High School by doing
janitorial jobs there, such as mowing the lawn. An athlete who
idolized the Chicago Cubs and dreamed of becoming a pitcher or
first baseman (''I was a cult of one,'' he laughs), he became a
star basketball player instead, which won him a scholarship to
Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   Once, recalled grammar-school chum Philip Corboy, they were
playing a pickup game when Corboy made a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, 'Goddammit, play this game the way it's supposed to
be played,' '' Corboy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, 'Hank, it's only a game.' And he said, 'What else is
there but the game?' The same fervor has carried him through
life.''
</P>
<P>
   On the court, it took him to the NCAA semifinals for the
Georgetown Hoyas in 1943.
</P>
<P>
   But then World War II interrupted his college career and Hyde
joined the Navy, where he spent a year and a half in the Pacific
and survived not only the typhoon but enemy fire during the January
1945 invasion of Luzon in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, inspired in part by an autobiography of noted
criminal defense attorney William J. Fallon, he used the GI Bill to
go to Loyola University Law School in Chicago. He graduated in 1949
after two straight years of classes, no summer vacations, and
working nights as a proofreader at the Chicago Sun-Times.
</P>
<P>
   By then, he was married to his wife, Jeanne, whom he had met _
and instantly fallen for _ at a Georgetown basketball game in 1947.
In Chicago, where he straggled home at 10 or 11 p.m., ``Jeanne
would be there and give me a cup of hot cocoa and then I would go
to bed,'' he said of those newlywed days.
</P>
<P>
   As a defense attorney, he made a name for himself representing
law enforcement officers. He often would unwind by walking a few
doors from his office to the Sherman Hotel to hear Hots play or by
taking his children, who eventually numbered four, to their Little
League games.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, the man who cast his first presidential vote
for Harry S Truman found himself drifting away from the Democratic
Party, disturbed by what he saw as labor's influence and too much
tolerance of the Soviet Union. He joined ``Democrats for Ike,'' and
soon after switched political parties.
</P>
<P>
   At first, his ambition was only to help the struggling GOP gain
members. But urged on by the party, he ran for Congress in 1962 and
lost. Four years later, he won a seat in the state legislature,
eventually rising to majority leader, but was deposed after an ugly
fight for the speakership.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took a seat in the back of the General Assembly, licked his
wounds and ran for Congress,'' recalled Rep. John Edward Porter,
R-Ill., then a young state House member who had backed Hyde.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1974, not a good year for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked like a mule,'' Hyde recalls. ``I rang doorbells.
People would open them and I would tell them who I am. They'd look
at me with an impenetrable stare and they'd say 'What do you think
of Nixon?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Watergate scandal that forced Nixon's resignation
that August, Hyde squeaked in with 53 percent of the vote _ one of
only 18 new Republicans elected that year _ and voters have handily
returned him to Washington every two years since then.
</P>
<P>
   Even a controversy over his role as a former director of a
failed savings and loan (its bailout cost taxpayers millions, but
Hyde was not required to pay any part of the $850,000 settlement
fee) did not dim his popularity with voters, though it fueled his
opponents' strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after 24 years in Congress, Hyde's office walls are
chockablock with framed photos of him with everyone from Bob Hope
to Mother Theresa, and even Clinton (signed ``with respect''). He
is so in demand as a speaker both in his home district and across
the country that he rarely vacations, and often misses his beloved
Saturday afternoon movie matinee with longtime friend and
administrative assistant Judy Wolverton.
</P>
<P>
   Leisure never gets in the way of his official or campaign work,
Wolverton says of her ``workaholic'' pal. (He did take time off to
sit at his wife's bedside around the clock as she lay dying of
cancer in 1992.)
</P>
<P>
   Besides work and his family, Hyde has a few lighter passions. In
the mid-1980s, the day after the first of his two prostate
surgeries, friend George Weigel visited him in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's sitting in bed with a cigar in his mouth, the Bears on
TV, and reading a biography of William Wilberforce (a British
abolitionist). That's Henry Hyde.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Hill, Hyde has earned national stature as a leading
conservative, first with his eponymous anti-abortion amendment,
then his eloquent backing of Lt. Col. Oliver North and President
Reagan during televised Iran-contra hearings, and more recently,
his role in pushing much of Gingrich's ``Contract with America''
through the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   While he missed Watergate, he did play a major role in the 1986
impeachment of U.S. District Judge Harry Claiborne (who was serving
a prison sentence for tax fraud at the time), arguing the case
against him before the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   There and on the House floor, Hyde has earned a reputation as a
fierce and often dominating debater.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the only person I know who can stand in the well (of the
House) and slice you to pieces and you feel good about it,'' said
Rep. William F. Goodling, R-Pa., the only other remaining
Republican from the class of '74.
</P>
<P>
   But for all his dyed-in-the-wool GOP credentials, Hyde has
broken ranks with his party time and again.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde resisted efforts to scrap the Voting Rights Act after a
1984 trip to the South where, among other things, he saw elderly
black people living in a trailer park who had to cross a busy
four-lane highway in order to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too soon to take the South out of the penalty box,'' he
said after that trip.
</P>
<P>
   He changed his mind on an assault weapons ban, deciding to
support it after reading a list of Chicago-area gun murders. He
scathingly calls term limits, a favorite of the younger GOP
generation and one of the key provisions of Gingrich's Contract,
``the dumbest idea since synthetic leatherette'' (even though he
dutifully reported the measure out of his committee), and he was
one of the few Republicans to support family medical leave.
</P>
<P>
   He also sticks by his friends, even when he differs with them
politically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had very strong primary challenges (in the '90s) from the
pro-life far right and never once has he done anything to help them
or hurt me,'' said Porter, who favors abortion rights. ``I think
it's because he doesn't forget people who help him.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in part because of his independent streak, the veteran
lawmaker _ and former Republican Policy Committee chairman _ has
not been invited into Gingrich's inner circle, although the speaker
has ``tremendous respect'' for Hyde, a Gingrich spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's old-time manners and judicial caution also have caused
some younger Republicans to complain he is too genteel and
laid-back to be a party standard-bearer. During one of his
best-known speeches against term limits, one member watching him on
C-SPAN muttered, ``Sit down, you silly old fool,'' remembered Rep.
David R. Obey, D-Wis., who promptly jumped to Hyde's defense.
</P>
<P>
   While Hyde's rhetoric ``sometimes gets carried away in the heat
of battle,'' Obey says, ``he understands you fight like the devil
for what you believe in, but there are certain ways that are
off-limits if you are going to keep this institution from becoming
a snake pit.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Hyde's habit of making decisions based not only on
politics but also on his deepest beliefs has won him fans on both
sides of the aisle and, from quite a few, kudos for how he is
handling impeachment fever so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henry won't have the Starr problem, with a political agenda
and nothing else,'' said former Rep. Pat Schroeder, D-Colo., who
worked with Hyde on the family leave bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's any less critical of Clinton's policies
(than other more outspoken GOP leaders), but he's much more
measured about this. He looks out for people's rights,'' said Rep.
Barney Frank, D-Mass., one of the most liberal and outspoken
members of Hyde's Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Frank pointed to the ``contentious but wholly civil'' hearings
on whether Attorney General Janet Reno should appoint an
independent counsel to look into White House fund-raising
activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wouldn't let the pursuit of the president get in the way of
that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Hyde largely has stayed out of the fray, focusing on
other pet projects, including the first reauthorization of the
Justice Department in nearly two decades and, of course, getting
re-elected this fall.
</P>
<P>
   He has no plans to retire any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loathe the thought of sitting around listening to my
arteries harden,'' he said. ``I want to be doing something
significant, consequential.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ George Washington dared to tax whiskey. James
Madison fled the White House as British troops approached during
the War of 1812, leaving his wife, Dolley, to fend for herself.
Franklin Delano Roosevelt hogged too much power with his New Deal
programs, critics charged.
</P>
<P>
   Good reasons to dump these presidents?
</P>
<P>
   Despite grumbled threats of impeachment, no.
</P>
<P>
   While threats of impeachment have emerged almost as often as
Washington's famed cherry blossoms, most have failed to rise to the
standard set by the Founding Fathers. Only 16 federal officials _
including one president _ have been impeached by the House, and
only seven of those, all federal judges, were convicted by the
Senate. But such threats often have set off controversy over just
what is an impeachable offense, a question sure to be raised anew
if Congress starts an impeachment inquiry against President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The authors of the U.S. Constitution wrote that impeachment _ a
formal accusation that a public official is unfit to serve in
office _ should result from ``treason, bribery, or other high
crimes and misdemeanors.'' No one quibbles over treason and
bribery. But what did the framers mean by high crimes and
misdemeanors?
</P>
<P>
   Does the phrase mean real crimes that can be prosecuted in
criminal courts, such as murder or burglary or obstruction of
justice? Or does it encompass more nebulous ``crimes'' that are not
necessarily indictable offenses, such as an abuse of presidential
power?
</P>
<P>
   Both points of view have their champions.
</P>
<P>
   Some past targets of impeachment _ President Andrew Johnson and
Supreme Court Justice Samuel(cq) Chase _ narrowly escaped expulsion
by claiming their alleged offenses were not criminal. President
Nixon's attorneys made the same argument, although he resigned in
the face of a House impeachment vote after transcripts of taped
conversations showed he participated in a cover-up of the White
House's involvement in the Watergate burglary _ that is, the crime
of obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably easier to impeach and remove someone from office
if they've committed an indictable offense: mail fraud, perjury,
tax evasion,'' said College of William and Mary law professor
Michael J. Gerhardt, author of ``The Federal Impeachment Process.''
</P>
<P>
   But many scholars, Gerhardt included, tend to come down on the
broader ``abuse of power'' side when explaining what the Founding
Fathers meant.
</P>
<P>
   After all, before the authors of the Constitution settled on the
words ``high crimes and misdemeanors,'' they considered ``mal or
corrupt conduct,'' ``malpractice or neglect of duty,'' and
``mal-administration.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one expected the president to commit ordinary
misdemeanors,'' said Ohio State University history and law
professor Michael Les Benedict, author of ``The Impeachment and
Trial of Andrew Johnson.'' Johnson was the sole president to be
impeached, for defying Congress, but was acquitted when the Senate
fell one vote short of the two-thirds majority needed to convict
him.
</P>
<P>
   The House itself has struggled with the question of a proper
standard for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, when Gerald Ford was a Republican congressman from
Michigan trying to oust Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas
from office, he argued that ``an impeachable offense is whatever a
majority of the House of Representatives considers it to be at any
given moment in history.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford was not successful. And his statement ``backfired,'' said
Johns Hopkins University political science professor Joel Grossman.
``It trivialized the impeachment process to a popularity contest.
You could say, 'I am impeaching the president because he beat me at
golf.' But no one would do that.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it typically has taken much more than a political tiff
to start impeachment proceedings. For instance, the unpopular
President Johnson infuriated members of Congress by calling them
``fractious,'' ``domineering'' and ``radical,'' and by failing to
support many post-Civil War reconstruction policies. But it wasn't
until he violated the Tenure of Office Act, by firing the secretary
of war in defiance of Congress, that the House succeeded in
impeaching Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers for the House Judiciary Committee reached a similar
conclusion when they began trying to determine if grounds existed
for impeaching Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers are studying their 1974 report amid expectations that
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's report to Congress will allege
that Clinton abused presidential powers to impede Starr's
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Watergate researchers wrote, ``In an impeachment proceeding,
a president is called to account for abusing powers which only a
president possesses. ... To confine impeachable conduct to
indictable offenses may well be to set a standard so restrictive as
not to reach conduct that might adversely affect the system of
government.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It can't be, 'I don't like your policy' or 'I want to throw
you out of office,' '' said Joseph Cooper, a political science
professor at Johns Hopkins University. ``It has to be a gross
violation of the conduct of the presidency.'' The two-thirds vote
needed in the Senate for a guilty verdict acts as a safeguard
against political vindictiveness, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Founding Fathers may have left the trigger for impeachment
intentionally vague so it could fit the then-unimaginable needs of
the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``They trusted George Washington,'' said Rice University history
professor Harold Hyman. ``But what if you got a rascal? What they
didn't know was how future presidents would behave.''
</P>
<P>
   The definition of high crimes and misdemeanors ``is open to
interpretation,'' he said. But in general, misdemeanors meant ``bad
conduct of a nature that imperils the stability of government and
society. It might mean inspiring covert action against friendly
nations or giving illicit favors to somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Do the accusations against Clinton meet the standard for
impeachment? Only Starr and his staff know for sure what evidence
exists of alleged presidential wrongdoing. But a number of scholars
say they are hard-pressed to see how Clinton could be imperiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Telling someone to lie about adulterous sexual relations, I
don't think that's anything particular to presidents,'' said
attorney John R. Labovitz, a legal researcher on the House
Judiciary Committee during the Nixon hearings and author of a 1978
book on impeachment. ``It has to do with the kind of conduct anyone
can engage in. It's just not an abuse of his political position.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The higher the profile of the figure being charged with
misconduct, the clearer the evidence has to be,'' said Gerhardt.
Impeachment, he adds, ``is cumbersome, so it only tends to move in
the face of clear, unambiguous evidence. I'm not sure we have in
this case any clear evidence. We have a lot of drama.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The system is going to give the president the benefit of the
doubt here,'' agreed Cooper, who nonetheless said that allegations
of obstruction of justice are ``very serious. We can't have a
president who abuses office that way, who manipulates people to
lie.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The impeachment of the president of the United
States is at its core a political process, not a criminal
proceeding, no matter how grave the charges against the chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   The judges and jurors in the process, the Congress of the United
States, have virtually no constraints _ other than their own
instincts for political survival _ in deciding if evidence exists
to warrant the removal of the nation's leader from office.
</P>
<P>
   The two occasions in American history in which the Congress came
close to ousting a president illustrate how central politics is to
the process of impeachment and trial.
</P>
<P>
   In 1868, President Andrew Johnson was saved by one Senate vote
after the House, led by radical members of his own Republican
Party, had approved articles of impeachment against him over a
political dispute on the post-Civil War reconstruction of the
South.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1974, President Richard Nixon, after losing the political
support of conservative House members in both parties over the
firing of Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox, chose to resign rather
than face impeachment for his role in the wide-ranging abuse of
power scandal known as Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the fate of President Clinton could rest more with
his fellow Democrats on Capitol Hill, House Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt of Missouri and Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of
South Dakota, than with the GOP leadership, House Speaker Newt
Gingrich of Georgia and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   And that does not bode well for Clinton in the event that the
House of Representatives decides that the evidence gathered by
Kenneth Starr during the last four years is sufficient to remove
Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton will not be defended to the last by Democrats the way
Nixon was supported by some Republicans,'' said Jeremy Mayer, a
political science professor at Kalamazoo College in Michigan. ``He
doesn't inspire that kind of loyalty in national Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   But, ultimately, members of Congress, with an eye on their
political future, will take their cues from the American people on
what to do if the House votes to impeach Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's quite a lot of room for public sentiment,'' said
Stanley Twardy Jr., a Connecticut lawyer who served as an aide to
former Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., a moderate Republican who gained
national prominence for his bipartisanship on the Senate Watergate
Committee in the 1970s. ``The House and Senate will be reflecting
what the American people believe.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why, scholars say, that the authors of the Constitution
were deliberately vague in drafting Article I specifying that the
president, as well as judges and other civil officers, may be
impeached for ``treason, bribery or other high crimes and
misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Kmiec, a professor of law at the University of Notre
Dame, said the phrase, ``high crimes and misdemeanors,'' is a term
that dates back 400 years in English law and was well known to the
authors of the Constitution to be rooted in the political power
struggle between the British Parliament and King Charles I.
</P>
<P>
   ``The English history is instructive because it was well-known
to our constitutional framers, and it suggests unequivocally that
impeachment is a political remedy, not a criminal one,'' said
Kmiec. ``It is a remedy for injury to the body politic, not for
deterring specific crimes or punishing them.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Hamilton said as much in Federalist No. 65, one of the
papers written in the late 1780s to explain the new Constitution
and urge its ratification. He wrote that impeachment offenses
``proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words,
from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They are of a
nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated political,
as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Then-Rep. Gerald Ford said it less eloquently but more clearly
in 1970 as several Republicans were threatening to impeach
then-Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas. An impeachable
offense, said Ford, is ``whatever a majority of the House of
Representatives considers it to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Article I of the impeachment bill against Nixon cited
him on such general charges as ``making false or misleading
statements for the purpose of deceiving the people of the United
States,'' for ignoring congressional subpoenas and ``misusing'' the
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

 By JIM HERRON ZAMORA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ John Santner likes to collect names.
</P>
<P>
   He had 160 them when the police arrested him last October,
including Florida driver's licenses with his picture under more
than a dozen different names, none of them his own. Most of the
identification cards listed people whose names were ``borrowed'' to
commit crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The licenses helped Santner and five accomplices scam at least
$4 million from businesses and mess up the lives of many innocent
people with forged checks and fraudulent credit cards. The police
said Santner had masterminded the biggest identity theft scam ever
seen in San Francisco, with a ring of thieves who took names and
Social Security numbers of other people and then created fraudulent
paper trails.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are artists,'' said San Francisco Police Inspector
Earl Wismer.
</P>
<P>
   Santner is a chilling example of one of the fastest-growing
crimes in the world. Identity theft accounts for about half of the
$1.5 billion in credit card theft in 1995, according to the Secret
Service, which monitors the crime. Consumer advocates estimate that
up to 350,000 people are victimized each year.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Santner, 33, pleaded guilty to nine counts of fraud and
was sentenced to six years in prison. His partner in crime,
29-year-old Eric Shay, received a six-year sentence after pleading
guilty to 18 fraud counts. Four co-defendants are at large or
awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   Identity theft is a crime that evolves with every advance in
technology. For the complex international economy to function
efficiently, credit must be easy, and money must move quickly and
electronically. A skilled thief can take advantage of that system,
harvest names, purchase thousands of dollars of merchandise and
bill it all to an unwitting victim whose identity has been stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Credit card theft had been the realm of pickpockets for decades.
Now, a new breed of high-tech thieves can steal a whole identity
and run up charges in the name, sometimes for years, without the
victim's knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   A national credit bureau, Trans Union Corp., has seen the number
of consumer inquiries and reports to its Fraud Victim Assistance
Department jump from 35,235 in 1992 to 522,922 in 1997, according
to figures cited by the General Accounting Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Identity theft is a plague right now,'' said Beth Givens of
the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse in San Diego, which tracks the
problem nationally. ``Every day, charges are being credited to
people who have no idea what's really going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Givens and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a private
consumer advocacy organization, estimate that up to 350,000 people
are victimized by identity theft each year.
</P>
<P>
   Most identity fraud starts small, with a few forged checks or
purchases on a stolen credit card. The more complicated scheme is
total identity assumption, where a thief applies for credit cards,
loans, utility accounts and apartments under someone else's name.
In some cases, a criminal will electronically graft his or her
photo onto a legally valid driver's license under another person's
name with correct information.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same people in yesteryear who may have gone guns blazing
into a bank are now doing identity theft,'' said Alison Koch, an
investigator with the California Department of Motor Vehicles who
specializes in identification fraud. ``It's a lot safer to do this
with a computer. ... Once they steal an ID, they can use false
documents to commit a multitude of white-collar crimes. And it's
difficult to catch people.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, one identification card will be used to apply for
instant credit at as many as a dozen department stores in a week.
The thief can walk in, get credit with the bogus ID and leave with
thousands of dollars in computer equipment, stereo components or
jewelry. Often, they'll hit different stores in different cities in
the course of a few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``They move fast to stay ahead of local law enforcement,'' said
Inspector Phil Dito, who worked the Santner case.
</P>
<P>
   The police broke the Santner ring because its leader liked San
Francisco too much, said Wismer, who spent more than two years
pursuing its leader. Santner stayed in the city for two years, even
after coming to the attention of investigators in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Santner and Shay participated in nearly every form of identity
theft, the police said. Few scam artists are as sophisticated as
Santner, a former chef with a knack for computers, and Shay, a
former employee of the credit reporting agency TRW (now known as
Experian) who is familiar with consumer databases.
</P>
<P>
   ``They mastered every aspect of this crime,'' Wismer said. ``It
was just like a business. They kept very detailed records. It was
an efficient, well-run criminal enterprise.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They used an unusual combination of high-tech and low-tech
methods to commit their crimes. Sophisticated computer graphic let
the duo create bogus driver's licenses from other states. They
searched Internet databases for personal information on potential
victims.
</P>
<P>
   But they found much of their treasure in the trash can. They
sifted through garbage for credit card receipts and paycheck stubs.
They broke into mailboxes on the street and in apartment complexes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made master keys to many of the mailboxes in San
Francisco ...'' Wismer said. ``They even had a postal uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   The police believe the thieves' favorite pieces of mail were
preapproved credit applications, charge card bills, car insurance
bills and motor vehicle registration notices, all used as building
blocks for false paper trails.
</P>
<P>
   Santner and his accomplices applied for credit cards and loans
and set up checking accounts. They put together folders on all
their potential victims, including one containing a department
store account statement and a garbage bill belonging to Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, D-Calif. They had another file under the name of a
prosecutor who worked their case.
</P>
<P>
   The police said the suspects had stolen ID cards and checks,
altered them with state-of-the-art desktop publishing equipment and
reprinted the bogus cards on a color printer. They were able to
electronically scan driver's licenses and then change the
information and drop in their own photographs, Wismer said.
</P>
<P>
   When the police raided Santner's office last October, officers
found extensive records on potential targets along with computers,
scanners and a huge amount of equipment. There was a mountain of
confidential data, including information poached from voter rolls,
credit applications and a master list of thousands of Florida
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of these names may not have been used _ yet _ but they
were always looking for new victims,'' Wismer said.

FRAUD VICTIMS OFTEN VICTIMIZED BY THE SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM HERRON ZAMORA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Marvin Young Jr. got home from work one evening
and found a certified letter from the Sacramento police that
changed his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a warrant for my arrest for check fraud,'' said
Young, who lives in Oakland. ``I nearly fainted. I'd never even
been to Sacramento.''
</P>
<P>
   That was in 1991. Seven years later, he is still fighting to
clear his name, stolen by a former housemate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having trouble explaining who I am _ he took over my
life,'' Young said. ``I just sold my house and I can't buy another
one. I've worked hard and never made a late payment in my life, but
this other guy has just messed up everything for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The saga of the real Marvin Young and the impostor using his
name illustrates the struggle identity-theft victims face in
reclaiming their names and restoring their credit. Identity theft,
one of the fastest growing crimes in the nation, is a type of fraud
in which a criminal takes another's personal information and uses
it to apply for credit. The con artist can then make thousands of
dollars in fraudulent purchases and have it all billed to an
unwitting victim.
</P>
<P>
   As in Young's case, catching the thief doesn't necessarily stop
the crime. The person who stole his identity has been arrested
several times, the authorities say, but apparently finds Young's
name too useful to resist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once these guys find a good name, they pretty much stick to
that and keep it going as long as possible,'' said Andrew Wong, a
U.S. Postal Service inspector who has handled numerous cases
identity theft. ``Many of these guys are into drugs and can't get
regular jobs. They just go back to what they know best.''
</P>
<P>
   Stealing a person's identity requires only a Social Security
number and one other piece of identifying information, such as a
mother's maiden name. Much of that type of information is now
available on the Internet for as little as $15.
</P>
<P>
   Once a thief gets a credit card in someone else's name, it's
party time. Thieves normally max out a fraudulent card in less than
an hour, leaving the victims to sort out the mess.
</P>
<P>
   In the Young case, he could prove that he was at work at a San
Francisco bank the day the fraudulent checks were written. But his
problems were far from over.
</P>
<P>
   The man who was Young's housemate for a few months in 1989 had
stolen his identity and run up debts around the nation,
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Young always carries copies of letters from the police and
credit agencies confirming his identity. He was never arrested for
the crimes committed in his name.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Young's case began in 1989, shortly after he moved to the
San Francisco from Mississippi. His housemate asked to see Young's
Mississippi driver's license photo. The man covertly copied some of
Young's personal information, including his Social Security number
and date of birth.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until two years later that Young realized he'd been
had. His housemate requested and received a copy of Young's birth
certificate from Mississippi, then used that document to obtain
driver's licenses in Young's name in several states. The impostor
opened credit lines at dozens of stores in different areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were 60 or 70 accounts in my name that I had to close,''
Young said.
</P>
<P>
   From 1991 to 1993, Young worked to clear his name, writing more
than 100 letters and checking his credit report regularly.
Eventually, Young settled into a normal life and even bought a
house. The impostor became a bad memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was quiet until August of 1997, then he went on a
rampage,'' Young said. ``In one month, he opened up 40 accounts in
my name. He was all over _ in Atlanta, Florida, Washington, D.C.,
and Minnesota.''
</P>
<P>
   Young's housemate was finally arrested. But Young is still
slogging his way out of the swamp caused by fraudulent bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a year later and I still can't get a drop of credit,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The police say that as long as credit cards and checks have
existed, criminals have used them for fraudulent purposes. Every
advance in technology brings new twists from scammers.
</P>
<P>
   Identity theft wasn't always so well-known, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in 1988 when it happened (to me), nobody even knew what I
was talking about,'' said Elsie Strong of Los Angeles, founder of
the support group Victims of Identity Theft. ``I felt so alone. Now
there are thousands of us. People need somebody to talk to. They
don't know what to do next. I realized that there needed to be a
group for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Strong was victimized, there have been thousands of
others, often without any knowledge they are victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these people don't find out about it until they're
getting a house. ... By the time they clear their credit, they've
missed getting the house,'' said Phil Dito, a fraud inspector with
the San Francisco police.
</P>
<P>
   Strong and other victims have testified for legislation to make
it easier to clean up credit and get tougher on perpetrators. They
share frustration over an economic system that grants credit easily
and a criminal justice establishment that puts a low priority on
prosecuting fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police just don't have time to really go after these
problems,'' said Joanne Mankiewicz of San Francisco, whose name was
used to amass $80,000 in debt. ``It's easier to go after a bank
robber who uses a gun than one who does it with paper and
plastic.''
</P>
<P>
   Mari Frank, an Orange County attorney who has worked on cases of
identity theft, summed up the odyssey of fraud victims:
</P>
<P>
   ``First you get victimized by the bad guy, then you get
victimized by the banks that won't believe you, then you get
victimized by the credit reporting agencies that won't take off the
fraudulent information and then you are victimized by another
company that won't give you credit, then you are victimized by
government agencies that won't believe you,'' Frank said. ``It's a
wound that never gets to heal.''

VICTIM OF IDENTITY THEFT NOW HELPS OTHERS SNARED BY SCAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM HERRON ZAMORA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If someone steals your name and runs up lots of
bills with it, how do you clear things up? Slowly.
</P>
<P>
   It took Mari Frank two years and became an obsession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through identity-theft hell and I survived,'' said
Frank, 50. ``I had to write 90 letters and spent 500 hours working
to clear my name.''
</P>
<P>
   But Frank, an attorney in Orange County, Calif., turned her
ordeal into a service for other victims: She has compiled a guide
to help others avoid the same problems. She has created an
``Identity Theft Survival Kit,'' written a book and pamphlets, and
produced computer discs with sample letters to send to banks,
creditors and credit reporting agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've become a reluctant expert,'' Frank said. ``I found out
more than I ever wanted to know about this.''
</P>
<P>
   She had no idea what identity theft was until 1995, when she
received a call from the Bank of New York demanding that Frank pay
up on her $11,000 credit card balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said: There must be some mistake. I don't have a credit card
with you,''' said Frank, an adjunct professor at the Western State
College of Law in Fullerton.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't. She'd been scammed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was technology rape,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A Ventura County woman had somehow gotten hold of Frank's Social
Security number and other personal data. The woman set up a series
of fraudulent lines of credit, ordering credit cards, starting
checking accounts and having Frank's mail sent to a different
address. The impostor ran up about $100,000 worth of bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``She even bought a car using my name,'' Frank said. ``And then
she didn't keep up her payments. ... Bills in my name were being
sent to Ventura (Calif.). I'd never even stopped there before.''
</P>
<P>
   The scam apparently had been going on for at least a year. After
spending thousands of dollars, Frank believes she has finally
cleared her name with the Bank of New York and other creditors
including Thrifty Rental Car, which was threatening to sue her
after the impostor trashed a car.
</P>
<P>
   The impostor, Tracy Lloyd, eventually pleaded guilty to six
counts of felony fraud but spent no time behind bars, Frank said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This woman stalked me. If she had used the .22 Beretta handgun
she had in her possession at the time of her arrest to steal that
money, she would still be behind bars. But instead she used a pen,
a computer and the telephone. She drove home from the courthouse in
the same red convertible Mustang that she bought with my name.''
</P>
<P>
   Repairing the damage can be difficult, time-consuming and
frustrating. Frank and other experts said that victims of identity
theft often become depressed. There is now a support group called
Victims of Identity Theft (310-397-3004).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fight for your credit and your sanity,'' Frank said.
``There's post-traumatic stress disorder that occurs from this
crime. Most of the time you don't know who is doing it, and the
perpetrators never get caught.''

   BURNING-THE-PRAIRIE (Grayslake, Ill.) _ Sometime this autumn,
after the nesting birds have migrated, the residents of Prairie
Crossing will go for the burn. Equipped with water tanks and
``flappers'' _ special rubber mats for tamping down flames _ they
will leave quaint new houses named for Illinois settlers to partake
in a novel suburban ritual: burning the prairie. The maverick 3
1/2-year-old development is the first major prairie reconstruction
in a residential development and perhaps the most visible symbol
yet of the popular reemergence of the Midwestern prairie, the
oceanic grassland Walt Whitman called North America's most
characteristic landscape. By Patricia Leigh Brown.
</P>
<P>
   HOLTZMAN-NEST (New York) _ Joseph Holtzman, the editor of Nest,
the artsy new journal of decor and interiors, does have a few
things in common with his editorial peers, the tough-as-nails
sheltertrixes at House and Garden, Elle Decor and Architectural
Digest. He, too, knows what he likes and he goes after it
ruthlessly. But any similarity between him and them ends right
about the point where Holtzman _ during an afternoon spent scouting
projects for the magazine _ pauses outside a limestone-faced
maisonette on the Upper East Side where, he said, the writer
William F. Buckley lives. Holtzman has an outsider's view of decor
_ in this case, literally. Nose to the window, he contemplated how
a Peeping Tom style photo shoot chez Buckley would go. ``The lights
are on,'' he said, peering in. ``It would be interesting to see
what kinds of endangered species he's got scattered around in
there.'' By David Colman.
</P>
<P>
   NY-BUYING-APARTMENTS (New York) _ Elliot Gold said it was time
his son, Shawn, 24, a marketer at J.P. Morgan, got his own
apartment. ``He was hanging around at home, making us crazy,''
joked Gold, 47. ``Enough was enough.'' His wife, Sharon Gold, said
that because the rents in Manhattan were ridiculously high, the
only thing that made sense was to buy. So last month, the Golds
helped to buy their son a two-bedroom duplex on that he plans to
share with a roommate _ one floor down from a young woman whose
parents bought her an apartment, and down the hall from a young man
whose parents helped him buy one. By Tracie Rozhon.
</P>
<P>
   SUBURBAN-SPRAWL (Undated) _ ``I love sprawl!'' claimed Susan
Nigra Snyder, a Philadelphia architect having lunch with a klatch
of design academics at the University of Pennsylvania. Defiant, she
paused for the horrified reaction she's come to expect. Indeed, the
eating stopped. Hearing an architect swoon over suburban sprawl is
the same as watching a chef pour Cheeze Whiz over a plate of
quenelles. Creative, you think, but alarmingly tacky. But what Ms.
Snyder really deplores is all the deploring. For decades, her
fellow designers have been so busy hating America's goofy suburban
image, judging it by its esthetic form, they have not dared to
venture forth and figure it out. By Barbara Flanagan.
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Garden questions answered. By Dora
Galitzki.
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE-APARTMENTS (New York) _ Bored to tears by endless
cocktail party speculation about whether the gyrating stock market
will tarnish the value of $10 million Park Avenue apartments? Take
that ennui right over to the Champs-Elysees and buy the same-size
prewar palace for a (relative) chanson _ significantly less than it
would cost in Manhattan. By Tracie Rozhon.
</P>
<P>
   INSTANT-IVY (Undated) _ Not since the 1920s has the New York
region witnessed estate-building on the scale and pace of the late
1990s. These aren't the dinky 10,000-square-foot McMansions that
are crowding the suburbs; they're serious turn-of-the-21st-century
manor houses of 15,000, 25,000 and 40,000 squre feet and more. One
problem with the new estates, however, is that they seem so, well,
new. Because, as more and more well-heeled homeowners are
discovering, you can simply pay architects, contractors and
landscapers to make the places look as if they've been there
forever. One popular 1990s makeover is instant ivy implants. By Tom
Connor.

UNUSUAL CHARACTERS CONVERGE AT SPIFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICKEY MEECE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Enter Spiff, and you find yourself in something like a 24-hour
diner where all types of weird characters converge. This
captivating online world unfolds at your direction at
www.manipulation.com/spiff/home/home.html.
</P>
<P>
   There are no rules at Spiff, no menu and no navigation bar.
Instead you move your mouse randomly around each screen, back and
forth, up and down, looking for a hidden link to a new page.
Sometimes there is more than one link, so routes vary. You never
know where you are or where you're going.
</P>
<P>
   Playfully, because this is all in fun, there are some booby
traps. Even though there are no directions, if you don't press
start on the home page, the Web masters will gently ask if you
meant to. If you select no instead of yes, this message appears:
``Fine, you don't get to play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Spiff is a game _ but only one of sorts, with three different
endings. The point is not to get to the end, it is how you get
there. Some of the more than 100 pages can make you laugh out loud,
like the Head page, where you pop the crudely drawn squiggly faces
until you find one that takes you somewhere else, and the Light
Bright page where you fill in the dots with colors.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like the Blue Wall can make you squirm (and make the
site inappropriate for children) as you read the fictional 1:33
a.m. ramblings of a man who recounts killing his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   The government page flashes the words ``test, kill, money and
technology,'' then declares ``the government is brainwashing you.''
When you move the mouse over a skull, it tells you, ``Don't push
me.''
</P>
<P>
   A defiant click of your mouse kicks you into a startling display
of break dancers on the linked page.
</P>
<P>
   The designers behind this free-form ``playground of ideas,'' as
they call it, are Jason Zada, 24, and Greg Hipwell, 26. Both work
for Spyplane.com, a new-media design company in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In their spare time, the two Web designers came up with Spiff,
Hipwell said. ``There was no game plan,'' he added. ``At one point
there was, but then it got to be pointless.''
</P>
<P>
   Zada said the two pushed the limits of the technology available
to them when they opened the site in March 1997. When the 3.0
versions of the most popular Web browsers came out, he said, he and
Hipwell had more room to experiment with techniques like image
rollovers, or turning one image into another.
</P>
<P>
   What began as an amazing display of graphics turned into
something more with text. ``I started using it as a place to put
ideas, my writings, what I was feeling at the moment,'' Zada said.
Then Spiff became a forum for poetry, essays, satire and other
writing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   You could spend hours on the site, said Eric Cordier, 27, of
France, who just completed his sophomore year at the School of
Visual Art's computer art program in New York. ``It's like a
maze.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Each page is very different in terms of designs,'' he said.
Among his favorites are the Hand page that asks you to place your
hand on the image of a hand on screen and another with animated
luggage.
</P>
<P>
   Zada and Hipwell have more fun in store, with Spiff 2000, an
updated version for the fall that they say again will push the
level of technology and graphics. &QL;

HELP FROM VETS AND OTHER EXPERTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Sure, there are Web sites to help you pick a puppy and a name
for it, figure out its biorhythms and even learn to communicate
telepathically with your cat, but the most important information
available to pet owners on the Web is in the area of health care.
</P>
<P>
   You can get online information that will help take your pet from
cradle to grave, or whelping box to funerary urn. But beware, such
sites cannot replace a trained veterinarian.
</P>
<P>
   At  &UR; www.netfopets.com/AskTheExperts.html &LR; , pet owners can submit
questions to veterinarians and other pet experts, who answer
certain ones and post them on the site. You can find out, for
example, about amyloidosis in a Shar-Pei, how to bathe a reluctant
dog, a horse with eye distress and a Welsh corgi with dental
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Dupage River Animal Hospital in Naperville, Ill., has a
comprehensive site at (www.xnet.com/ipedal/PETDR1.html), covering
the services that pets 6 years old and older need each year (a
thorough physical examination, complete blood count and chemistry
profile, urinalysis and fecal analysis for parasites; a dog also
needs a heartworm blood test.) There is also a helpful checklist
for determining when your pet is sick and what to do about it. Take
note: Animals have evolved to hide their symptoms and to appear
healthy at all costs to avoid being thinned from the pack.
</P>
<P>
   List-serves and bulletin boards are rich resources for pet
owners, especially for people concerned with unusual breeds or pet
ailments. Darcie Krueger, co-owner of Sitstay,  &UR; (www.sitstay.com) &LR; 
an Internet store in Lincoln, Neb., took her problem with a Belgian
Tervuren on line when her dog was trying to clear its nasal
passages by what she called ``reverse sneezing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When she did it, it was very traumatic for all of us,'' said
Ms. Krueger, who videotaped the behavior and sent it to a vet she
had found on line who specializes in Tervurens.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, you could ask your vet or people in your
hometown, and those were the answers you were going to get,'' Ms.
Krueger said. ``Now you can get quicker, faster answers from people
who know that particular dog.''
</P>
<P>
   There comes a time when a pet is too old or sick to enjoy
living. A very well-written site
 &UR; (www.avma.org/care4pets/losspetl.htm) &LR;  sponsored by the American
Veterinary Medical Association discusses how to decide whether to
euthanize a pet, how to help grieving family members and how to
cope with one's own grief.

   What a difference a few years can make.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the conspicuous absence of products for girls in the
world of computer software had academic researchers and marketing
managers alike gnashing their teeth over the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Now the software is here. By the end of 1998, 65 titles for
girls in these age groups will be available, a striking increase
compared with 1995, when there were just 10 titles available.
software companies will produce more than 50 titles for girls in
these age groups, more than double the number of programs available
last year.
</P>
<P>
   But for those with the lofty goal of providing girls with
carefully designed, thoughtful programs that avoid blatant
stereotypes and offer intellectual and creative challenges, the
news is not so good.
</P>
<P>
   According to PC Data, a market research company in Reston, Va.,
nearly half of the top 20 best-selling titles are from Mattel's
Barbie collection. Others companies, like Polaroid, Hasbro and
Disney, are following suit with makeover and jewelry software, pony
games and kitchen fun. The girl games are here and all decked out
in pink ribbons. It turns out that girls _ and boys, for that
matter _ are as locked into stereotypes as ever.
</P>
<P>
   The first piece of girls' software to succeed, Barbie Fashion
Designer, mimicked a successful toy. Since its debut in 1996, it
has sold nearly 800,000 copies. In rapid succession, Mattel
produced 24 more Barbie titles, and 5 more are due this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Polaroid began selling Photomaxine, a girls' version
of its Photomax program for digital photograph manipulation. Girls
can scan photographs of their own faces into a gallery of other
photographs that is heavy on brides, cheerleaders, waitresses,
models and angels.
</P>
<P>
   Photomaxine also comes with a Cosmopolitan Virtual Makeover and
a video game called Clueless, a Mattel game for preteen girls based
on the movie and television series. Hasbro will soon begin selling
My Little Pony software, derived from a popular toy for younger
girls, and Disney will market My Disney Kitchen, a CD-ROM cooking
game.
</P>
<P>
   Does the preponderance of pink mean that the marketing hands
have won out over the idealists?
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily. Having found its place on retailers' shelves,
software for girls appears to be in a period of transition. The
Barbie games are just the first step, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mattel really changed the rules of the game,'' said Justine
Cassell, an assistant professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology Media Laboratory and co-editor of a forthcoming book
called ``From Barbie to Mortal Kombat: Gender and Computer Games''
(MIT Press). ``They served as a wedge, and now there's a big market
of parents saying: `Oh my God, have we been selling our girls
short? We've got to start filling our girls' shelves.' Parents are
now thinking about their girls as consumers of computer toys, and
girls are thinking that, at least in part, the computer isn't
entirely a boy's toy.''
</P>
<P>
   Some dismay on the part of idealists was inevitable. When
feminists and the industry started working in the last decade
toward what seemed to be a similar goal, games for girls, Dr.
Cassell said, they had actually headed in two different directions.
``Feminists went into this to repair a rift between girls and
technology,'' Dr. Cassell said. ``Industry leaders, on the other
hand, went into this to acquire a new market.''
</P>
<P>
   Nods toward enlightenment are scattered throughout the new
games. The photograph possibilities in the Polaroid gallery include
a pilot and an astronaut. In Barbie's Ocean Discovery, Barbie
mentions in passing her studies in marine biology as she plies the
sea's depths, unfettered by diving gear but pretty in pink earrings
and blue eyeshadow.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, electronic Barbie has become something of a standard
bearer.
</P>
<P>
   While listing the software available for the Macintosh during a
speech at the Macworld Expo in Boston this summer, Apple Computer's
interim chief executive, Steve Jobs, welcomed three Barbie titles
into the fold. ``And when your daughters are done with them, they
can get a Cosmopolitan Virtual Makeover,'' he said. On the huge
projection screen behind Jobs appeared a snapshot of the Cosmo
makeup title. Slightly judgmental laughter rippled through the
audience. Jobs, clearly a bit embarrassed, moved quickly to a slide
of a Sesame Street educational game. The audience applauded with
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the way girls play on the computer reflects the way
they play off the computer. To expect otherwise is unrealistic,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because computers were such a new medium, we thought that they
wouldn't carry the traditional baggage, that they would be more
gender-neutral, but we were wrong,'' said Jo Sanders, director of
the Center for Gender Equity at the Washington Research Institute
in Seattle. ``It turns out you can't pull computer software out of
the society any more than you can pull television programs or
magazines.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many observers are pleased to see something
that not only gets girls seated at the computer, but helps to keep
them there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is the fact that girls see the computer used as
a medium that supports something they would do, something that
belongs to them,'' said Maria Klawe, the incoming dean of the
Faculty of Science at the University of British Columbia in
Vancouver, who has conducted extensive research on the differences
between girls' and boys' approaches to computer games.
</P>
<P>
   But some academic researchers and feminists outside universities
are concerned that such games merely reinforce in girls a sense of
who society says they should be rather than who they are. More
specifically, they say, fashion and hairdo games obscure the more
interesting and challenging ways in which girls might use
computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all embedded in a gender system,'' said Katha Pollitt,
an essayist and a poet. ``And if you don't really work at
presenting alternatives to your daughter, she falls into the
accepted social pattern, which is being obsessed with her looks. I
refuse to believe there are very many little girls out there who
can't be introduced to the computer through something that's a
little more challenging.''
</P>
<P>
   Purple Moon, a well-financed Silicon Valley start-up that is
devoted to girls' software, is trying to create games that, while
not necessarily more challenging, go beyond an obsession with
looks. Purple Moon's co-founder, Brenda Laurel, a 47-year-old
self-described feminist, made a conspicuous decision to stay away
from a strident message and go for the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't change the world by producing something that 200
kids play with,'' she said. ``You've got to try to do something
that's pervasive enough and in tune enough with popular culture
that you get your foot in the door.''
</P>
<P>
   Purple Moon bills its games as ``friendship adventures'' and
says they emphasize the ``formation of self.'' The lead character
in several of the games is a middle schooler named Rockett, whose
popularity hinges on decisions made by each player. ``Girls spend a
lot of time thinking about what's good, what's right, what kind of
relationships do I want,'' Dr. Laurel said.
</P>
<P>
   When the first Rockett titles appeared late last year, some
feminists criticized the software for being too passive and said
Rockett was too preoccupied with parties and popularity. A new
title, The Starfire Soccer Challenge, due in stores in November, is
about the trials and tribulations of trying out for a soccer team
and has received more positive marks from feminists.
</P>
<P>
   Though Purple Moon's titles have been heavily publicized and are
selling respectably, they haven't done much to loosen Barbie's
stronghold. The Learning Company's American Girls games, based on
the line of dolls, and the Madeline series, based on the Ludwig
Bemelmans character, are also popular and present players with some
intellectual substance. While they have a number of successes,
they, too, remain overshadowed by the Barbie games.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Cassell of MIT, who also designs computer games, said games
should allow boys and girls to step out of the prescribed roles
society sets for them. Instead of accentuating the differences
between boys and girls, she said, good computer software should
draw a ``thousand-way distinction, letting children place
themselves anywhere on the spectrum.'' One way to do this is to
allow children to design the interaction, and the characters they
will interact with, in the game.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Dr. Cassell and her students at the Media Lab have
designed a computer game called Sage, for Storytelling Agent
Generation Environment. In the game, children interact with a wise
old person they choose from a menu of characters _ a rabbi, a
Buddhist scholar, a grandmother _ and can also create their own
storytellers, culling their wisdom from traditional folklore and
their own notion of what would soothe them if they need a friendly
ear. Several companies are considering adopting aspects of Sage in
upcoming products, Dr. Cassell said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Sage model, the child makes the decisions, instead of
having the toy company decide on the nature of the interaction.
``Until you allow the kid to color the computer the color she wants
it,'' Dr. Cassell said, ``and until you accept the fact that the
computer is a good reflection of who we are, rather than us
deciding what the girl is, we will always be imposing some
stereotype of girlhood on girls through the computer games that we
give them to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Dr. Cassell and others said, retailers and marketing
departments will come to agree that they should tailor games toward
children's particular interests, not their sex. ``It'll take maybe
20 years or 50 years _ it may not come in our lifetime,'' said Ms.
Sanders of the Center for Gender Equity. ``But there is no major
consciousness shift that ever does.''

<P>
   Homeowners with leaky basements are often faced with deep
puddles of water on the floor. Installing a sump pump in the
basement can help, but it will not prevent water from entering the
basement. It will only remove the water that collects.
</P>
<P>
   Hooking up the pump is relatively easy _ plug in the electrical
cords and run PVC pipe from the pump discharge port to the
outdoors. The hard part _ positioning the pump below floor level _
entails breaking through the concrete floor and digging a pit about
30 inches deep. Breaking through the floor will be easier if you
rent an electric jackhammer with a spade bit (make sure it uses
120-volt household current).
</P>
<P>
   Ideally the pump should be where water is most apt to collect,
and near an electrical outlet if possible. But you do not want to
break into the floor where the sewer line or main water line passes
under it. Usually you can locate these lines if there are fixtures,
such as a sewer-line cleanout fitting or a water supply shutoff
valve inside the basement. You can also get help from your local
building-codes department.
</P>
<P>
   The depth and width of the pit will depend on the size of the
pump. It should be deep enough so the rim of the pump liner is
level with the basement floor and 12 inches wider than the liner
diameter. The excavation should also be at least 8 inches from the
basement walls so you can avoid hitting the foundation footing as
you dig down.
</P>
<P>
   Lay out the area to be excavated on the floor. Use the
jackhammer (wear safety goggles, heavy-duty gloves and work shoes)
to break into the floor around the perimeter of layout. Split the
interior slab into smaller chunks. Remove these pieces, then dig
down to excavate a hole for the liner.
</P>
<P>
   Place the liner into the hole and use a straight edge to make
sure the rim is even with the floor. Fill the cavity around the
liner with coarse gravel till the gravel comes about an inch above
the underside of the basement floor. Finish the pit by pouring
concrete over the gravel and level it with the surrounding floor.
Allow three days for the concrete to cure before installing the
pump.
</P>
<P>
   The sump pump forces the collected water through a discharge
port on the side of the housing. You will have to attach PVC pipe
to this port so the water can be routed from the pump to the
outdoors. Begin by threading a PVC male adapter into the discharge
port. Next, using PVC glue, connect a length of PVC pipe to the
adapter. When the pump is in position, this riser pipe should
project about 6 inches above the rim.
</P>
<P>
   The pump has two electrical cords, one to the motor, the other
to the float mechanism. Bind these to the riser with electrical
tape or plastic electrical ties, then lower the pump into the
liner. When it is in place, check to make sure the float mechanism
swings freely.
</P>
<P>
   Set the lid on the liner _ you may have to cut an opening in the
lid to accommodate the riser pipe. Next install the check valve on
the riser. The check valve is necessary because it prevents pumped
water from falling back into the liner when the pump shuts off.
Most check valves are held in place with a rubber sleeve and hose
clamps. Simply slide the sleeve over the riser and tighten the
clamps with a screwdriver.
</P>
<P>
   The discharge water must be purged outside the house, not
through the plumbing system. The simplest way to do this is by
running PVC pipe from the check-valve connection through the rim
joist above the basement wall. Use a hole saw to cut through the
joist, then push the pipe through the hole. Seal the opening around
the pipe with high-grade silicone-based caulk.
</P>
<P>
   The electrical hookup is relatively easy. With most pumps the
float-mechanism cord and pump cord are joined with an electrical
coupling. Plug this coupling unit into a nearby GFCI outlet.

<P>
   Just what is the World Wide Web made of? Tips and tails and
puppy-dog sales, if you know where to look.
</P>
<P>
   Need a set of tarot cards for your dog? Advice on feline
midwifery? Troubled because you have a Belgian Tervuren with
reverse sneezing? Trolling through the Internet, you can find
homeless hairless cats awaiting adoption, sanitary-napkin belts for
dogs (one brand is called Fancy Fannies) and home pages for any
breed of hound imaginable (if you're not easily repulsed by the
human tendency to dote on other species). After all, every dog has
its data.
</P>
<P>
   And there is plenty to learn about the care and feeding of
birds, snakes, fish and assorted furry creatures, from the lowly
boa constrictor to the arboreal Australian sugar glider, a
five-inch-long marsupial that humans have taken to carrying around
in their breast pockets ( &UR; www.herpeton.com/pet.html &LR; ).
</P>
<P>
   Pet-related sites can have a certain sideshow quality to them.
Write to Theophilus, the cat with his own e-mail. Learn the amazing
technique by which Bubba the fish learned to swim through a hoop.
Meet Pete, the cat who looks like Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   Where else could you find Czarina Oksana Borzoi Diva Dog
Needlenose of MuffinTush, the Ann Landers of canine expatriate
nobility, who answers questions that borzois and other dogs
instruct their human servants to e-mail to her? These pressing
questions include, ``Why do my humans think that decorating is more
important than my needs?'' and, ``Has Your Regalness attended an
agility trial?'' She regales her readers at
 &UR; members.aol.com/MuffinTush/Pages/Opage.html &LR;  with tales of her new
boy toy, Dylan, who is ``not much in the brains department'' but
``quite a Renaissance dog for a Lab.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Web offers more than yucks for the pet set. Jibralta
Merrill of Studio City, Calif., who types for Oksana, has been able
to consult with veterinarians in the Borzoi Internet community
about a recent health concern Oksana faced (though in true
aristocratic fashion, neither wished to discuss the particulars.)
Her friends from the Web page rallied and sent more than 50
messages of support. And through the Ask Oksana and borzoi rescue
sites, Ms. Merrill was able to find a new home _ in just 36 hours _
for a rambunctious borzoi about to get the boot.
</P>
<P>
   A close reading of the Web on a topic as potentially resonant as
the silent, forgiving companions asleep by the hearth gives a
glimpse of the real life of real people, like the neighbors'
nighttime noises, overheard through open windows. For pet lovers,
it can be moving to read about Bubba, the double yellowhead parrot
whose owners, Paul and Jean Dennis, readers of the online Fort
Worth Star-Telegram, taught him to sing ``You Are My Sunshine'' and
wave bye-bye.
</P>
<P>
   And a prayer written by Bob Deeds for the late Lakota, a
wolf-dog hybrid, hits home to anyone who has lost a pet: ``Let her
spar with Zeiko and Becky so she won't miss Bo and Ced. (For they
miss her very much.) Let her howl at her hearts content! Not a
meloncoly lonely howl, but one of joy and peace.''
</P>
<P>
   That appeared in
 &UR; www.star-telegram.com/interact/forums/petmemo.htm &LR; , The
Star-Telegram's popular page for pet memorials. (The paper will
even scan in photos free.) The site features an homage to ``my
first rat, Morpheus Brian,'' who ``left us nine children _ Enga
Mircalla, Titania Sophia, Oberon Orpheus, Lulu Winter, Jollyette,
Homeo, Corpse, Julian El Nino, and Hecubus.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty percent of people with cats or dogs carry snapshots of
their pets in their wallets, and at Christmas, 63 percent of owners
give their dogs a present. With Internet sites now selling
pet-related goods, including one that says it acts as a personal
shopper for pets (www.rwoof.com/rwoof/index.html), sales of pet
presents are expected to rise.
</P>
<P>
   Many pet-related sites are seeing high volumes of visitors,
including a site run by Karen Pryor, author of ``Don't Shoot the
Dog,'' (Bantam paperback, 1985), who is a strong proponent of
training animals, including llamas and fish, with positive
reinforcement by using clickers, those little toys with a noisy,
flexible tab of metal on the back. ``The Internet has really been
the soul of this business, also the soul of the clicker movement,''
Ms. Pryor said. She said her Web site, which goes by
 &UR; dontshootthedog.com &LR;  or  &UR; clickertraining.com &LR;  and offers
information, books and videos, gets 100,000 hits a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The month it went up, the site doubled our business, and since
then we've been growing at 5 percent a month,'' Ms. Pryor said.
Small groups of clicker-trainers in Finland, Croatia and Australia,
as well as larger groups in North America, can keep up to date on
various topics (like teaching a dog to ride a skateboard) via the
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It erases time so you don't have to worry about waking someone
up at 6 a.m. with a question,'' she added. ``You can make little
Manhattan Projects out of your own interests.''
</P>
<P>
   You can even get Internet help to name your pet. At
 &UR; homearts.com/depts/pastime/petnam16.htm &LR; , enter the species, sex,
preferred first letter and up to three categories (arts and
literature, biblical/mythologicaland sports, for example) for a
name, and you get back a list of suggestions. A request for
``insulting'' cat names somehow yields the following: Alimony, Dog,
Ego, Gore, Hog, Pooper, Trog and Wisenheimer.
</P>
<P>
   For those looking to choose and train a dog, the Web offers many
suggestions. There is a handy puppy aptitude test available at
 &UR; www.rahul.net/hredlus/pat1.html &LR;  that allows a prospective dog
owner to gauge its temperament on a numerical scale, based on what
it does in certain situations, like being rolled over onto its back
and held there for 30 seconds. Information on crate training, which
gives pets den-like boxes as their own private space, safe from
dangers and temptations in the house, can be found in a Frequently
Asked Question page called 
 &UR; www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/dogs-faq/crating/faq.ht
ml &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   While the Internet can let you rub shoulders with people you
might not want to stand behind in a grocery line _ watch out for
what can come up in a search for ``naked mole rats'' _ the
petophiles appear to be a well-meaning bunch. For instance, the Dog
Hause Web ring, a pack of connected dog sites found at
 &UR; www.doghause.com/links.html &LR; , awards an I Care icon to sites that
display a graphic about spaying and neutering if said sites are run
by people whose pets are spayed or neutered (certified via an
e-mail saying they are.)
</P>
<P>
   The site called  &UR; www.rwoof.com &LR;  is a sponsor of PAWS(Pets are
Wonderful Support), which helps people with AIDS care for their
pets, while another pet supply site,  &UR; www.sitstay.com &LR; , donates 10
percent of its profits to animal rescue efforts, groups that find
homes for animals.
</P>
<P>
   A number of sites aim to reunite lost pets with their owners,
like  &UR; www.missingpets.com &LR; , which lists descriptions of lost and
found pets from all over the country, (``lost, St. Gabriel,
Louisiana, golden long-hair chihuahua, green eyes; answers to
Bean'') and  &UR; missingpet.org &LR; , which lists tips for finding lost
pets, like distributing Missing Dog Trading Cards. Sherlock Bones,
at  &UR; www.sherlock.com &LR; , offers hints on making effective Lost Pet
posters and can mail out postcards with pictures of a missing pet
in the neighborhood where it disappeared. Tales of happy endings
can be found on these sites.
</P>
<P>
   But as anyone who has ever fished a bale of cat furr out of a
mouse knows, computers and pets aren't always simpatico. The Web is
full of sites listing the classic 20 Reasons Why Dogs Don't Use
Computers, which includes:
</P>
<P>
   20. Can't stick their heads out of Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   18. Hard to read the monitor with your head cocked to one side.
</P>
<P>
   16. Can't help attacking the screen when they hear, ``You've got
mail.''
</P>
<P>
   6. Smell U-Smell Me still in beta test.

HELPING TO SAVE A FEW GOOD DOGGIES FROM DEATH ROW 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
(jt) 
 By PAULA SCHWARTZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saucer-size brown eyes gaze longingly from the computer screen.
His name is Harry, and he was on Death Row. With that exaggerated
underbite and those crossed eyes, he looks a little like a
gargoyle, and he may be a biter. On the plus side, he's
affectionate, neutered and housebroken. He just needs love _ who
doesn't? _ but time wasn't on his side.
</P>
<P>
   Harry is a 2-year-old, 15-pound Shih Tzu-terrier mix who was
listed recently with Pet Finder, a pet adoption center on the Web
 &UR; (www.petfinder.org) &LR; . It has a searchable database of more than
1,800 adoptable animals from New Jersey, New York, Connecticut and
other areas. In late August, Pet Finder added listings from two
shelters in Missouri, one in Minnesota, two in Virginia, seven in
Pennsylvania and one in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Being listed with Pet Finder may well have given Harry his best
chance at a new life because on any given day, as many as 900
people visit the site, its founders say.
</P>
<P>
   Pet Finder was started in January 1996 by Betsy and Jared Saul.
Ms. Saul, a 30-year-old agricultural assistant in New Jersey, is an
animal lover who has worked with rescue shelters since she was 12.
Her husband, 28, is a hospital radiology resident. They made a New
Year's resolution to develop a page for animals needing homes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Saul said Pet Finder was the nation's first statewide
Internet adoption site and the first to join on one site any two
shelters that were not affiliated in any way. Before that,
individual shelters listed their animals individually, as did
adopt-a-pet sites linked to specific breeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were frustrated at how few nonprofit organizations were
using the full potential of the Internet,'' Ms. Saul said. ``We
wanted to design the perfect Web site, where pictures would make a
huge difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers scan photos of the animals and update the lists
regularly. They get their information by visiting the shelters or
taking reports from other volunteers; pets can also be listed for
adoption _ without pictures _ by individuals.
</P>
<P>
   After some initial reluctance by animal lovers, Ms. Saul said,
``eventually they realized that Internet adopters are pretty cool
people. They tend to be highly educated and to have more money to
take care of pets.''
</P>
<P>
   While there is no substitute for snuggling with Fido before
inviting him into your home, adopting through the Internet has its
advantages. Dogs may be purebreds, obedience-trained and
housebroken. Cats, rabbits and even ferrets may be neutered and
litter-trained.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are descriptions of the animals' personalities, like
the ``2-year-old dwarf rabbit that will run circles around legs
while making happy clicking-bunny sounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Possible problems are pointed out. The site says a 6-year-old
English springer spaniel ``may bark at ducks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People can search for pets in the emotional safety of their
own living rooms, and the whole family can be involved,'' Ms. Saul
said. That avoids the situation in which people visit shelters and
adopt a sad-looking pet out of pity, and the adoption doesn't work
out, she added.
</P>
<P>
   And how's Harry? He is alive and well now in Spring Valley,
N.Y., where he roams on an acre of land. He belongs to a family
with two girls, 10 and 13 years old. Ilana Perles, who adopted
Harry, said: ``He's adorable. A real sweetie.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   For tourists in an foreign city, a reminder of home can often be
more thrilling than the exotic allure of the unfamiliar. Or so it
would seem, judging from the squeals of delight from a gaggle of
six young Japanese women who spotted a pair of digital photo
machines in downtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The machines, which have been wildly popular in Japan for four
years, are still a novelty in the United States. Unlike traditional
photo booths, which spit out a utilitarian strip of black-and-white
photographs, these slick kiosks offer sheets of tiny (one-half inch
by three-quarters of an inch), sticky-backed portraits taken
against a wide choice of digitally generated backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   The backgrounds feature disparate images, like sports themes or
cartoon mice, that make the subject look like a character in the
latest video game.
</P>
<P>
   The six women, in New York recently for a one-day sightseeing
and shopping break from their courses at Towson University near
Baltimore, crowded into one of the colorful, arcade-style cabinets
outside Venus, a hair, makeup and Japanese-toy boutique in SoHo.
</P>
<P>
   Giggling under the kiosk's canopy, they scrolled through the
choice of backgrounds, which they could see on a small screen, and
finally settled on one. Then the digital camera clicked their
image.
</P>
<P>
   While they waited for their stickers to be developed _ about a
minute _ the women tried to explain in their newly learned English
why they found the photo kiosk so irresistible. After a few moments
of eager frustration, a 19-year-old, Ayako Yamano, pulled out her
notebook to show 15 pages filled with hundreds of photo stickers of
her with her friends. This, she explained, is her way of capturing
memories.
</P>
<P>
   A friend, Chika Igarashi, 19, showed one of the images just
taken: a tiny photo of the five friends, framed by red and white
stripes, a flag and the words ``the United States.'' Yukari Yokota,
18, pointed to the sticker and said: ``See? We will always remember
this trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourists were not the only customers lured to the kiosks. In two
hours on a weekday afternoon, seven different groups of people
posed in front of the camera, some of them cooing couples.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Ruscio, 34, a mother of three children clamoring for their
pictures to be taken by the bleeping, talking machines, said: ``The
kids just love these things. And we can send the photos to
family.''
</P>
<P>
   With the popularity of digital photo booths growing in the
United States, the old black-and-white models may soon take their
place among other beloved relics of analog America. Once a draw for
travelers in a hurry to replace old passport pictures or friends
wishing to commemorate a moment in time, these curtained booths
invoke memories of a fading era, like the Main Street drug stores
and dime stores where they were found.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, photo-sticker kiosks represent a slick
entertainment experience that one might expect in a superstore or
suburban mall. Most kiosks' video screens display a choice of up to
a dozen background frames.
</P>
<P>
   The backgrounds, stored in digital cartridges that can be
switched according to season, location or regional preferences,
include covers of famous magazines, cartoons of Santa Claus and the
Easter Bunny and pastoral frames of flowers and patterns. Not
surprising, many machines end up covered in stickers left by happy
patrons.
</P>
<P>
   The technology represents a pared-down engineering feat when
compared with analog photo booths. The plastic cabinets house only
three basic mechanisms. The picture takers adjust the size and
position of the image, watching themselves against a blue screen on
a small monitor, by using simple controls that operate a digital
camera's telephoto lens.
</P>
<P>
   A central processing unit makes a composite image of the
background frame and the digital image and converts it to a
printable format. A specialized printer, made by either Sony or
Mitsubishi, then generates the sheets of color stickers.
</P>
<P>
   The machines typically produce up to 16 stickers for about $3.
Some advanced models generate cards with stickers in multiple
sizes, ranging from the small decals to a more passport-like size.
And because each sticker machine features simple, digital controls
over its lens, consumers can control their position and size within
a frame by zooming in or out.
</P>
<P>
   The first photo-sticker machine appeared in Japan in 1995; it
was designed to help lure customers into a store. It worked
particularly well among girls 10 to 14 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japanese girls put these stickers on everything,'' said Brian
G. Duke, director of sales for the Atlus Dream Entertainment Co.,
in Irvine, Calif., one of the four main manufacturers of
photo-sticker machines. ``They put them on their notebooks, their
clothing, their bags, you name it.''
</P>
<P>
   His own business card is festooned with a memorable photo
sticker of himself screaming into a cartoon background frame of a
phone below the words, ``Call me!!''
</P>
<P>
   By positioning the bright, noisy contraptions outside a store's
entrance, Japanese retailers were able to increase traffic into
clothing shops, fast-food restaurants and video arcades.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For coin-operated arcade retailers especially, photo-sticker
machines represented salvation in the form of a new consumer base.
``Thanks to the explosion in home-console games, arcade operators
lost the teen-agers who were going home to the Sega game systems in
their living rooms,'' Duke said. Because of the introduction of
photo-sticker machines, that trend has been reversed and video game
arcades are popular once more.
</P>
<P>
   The kiosks became a phenomenon in Japan in less than a year.
Three years and 40,000 machines later, signs of a slowdown have yet
to appear. Because the background cartridges can be swapped
frequently for new images, teen-agers regularly return to photo
booths to view the latest frames and formats.
</P>
<P>
   Stickers have thus become collectibles, and teen-agers look for
the machines with the coolest frames.
</P>
<P>
   In America, the craze has not yet hit. Brent Shaw, the East
regional sales manager for American Photo Booth International, said
the first machine was brought here in the winter of 1996 by his
company, of Roanoke, Va., which placed its first kiosk in a store
called Imagine That in Rockville, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States has only approximately 1,600
machines, the high-stakes competition between the four biggest
manufacturers has already become heated. American Photo Booth
International, which says it has 50 percent of the United States
market with its Sticker Station machine, finds itself locked into a
struggle with the newcomer, Atlus, which says it owns 60 percent of
the photo-sticker market worldwide, operating machines as part of a
joint venture with Sega.
</P>
<P>
   Two companies have a smaller United States presence, SNK of
Japan and Photo Vend International in Sunrise, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Both American Photo Booth International and Atlus say they are
serious about developing brand-name recognition in this country.
``APBI jump-started the American market by forming the right
relationships,'' said Dick Hofmann, a regional sales manager for
the company. ``As a result, we've been able to garner the best and
most important licenses, as well as some of the most valuable store
positioning.''
</P>
<P>
   APBI has licensing and distribution partners like ESPN
(evidenced on Hofmann's business card by a sticker featuring a
snowboarding hot-dogger hovering over Hofmann's head), and Macy's
in Manhattan, which now features four Sticker Stations in the
renovated children's department at Herald Square.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw pointed out that the Sticker Stations had a motorized
mechanism to the internal camera up or down, allowing small tykes
or tall adults to use the kiosks without having to stand on a box
or kneel down. ``Our machines do not have a standard field of
vision, so it can be easy for even a person in a wheelchair to
use,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Duke, of Atlus, said its deluxe Print Club 2 and Super Print
Club models provided customers with stickers of different sizes on
one card as well as a higher print quality than competitors.
</P>
<P>
   American Photo Booth International's machines have become a
presence in teen-age retail havens like the Urban Outfitters chain.
On a recent afternoon at one midtown Manhattan location, 10 picture
takers reported their satisfaction with the Sticker Station.
</P>
<P>
   At Patricia Fields, a downtown boutique, one wall is covered
with stickers from patrons using one of the first Print Club
machines in New York. A Patricia Fields' buyer who would identify
himself only as Rudy said the distributor needed to be asked every
other day to replace the film in the machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get about 12 to 13 people a day using the machine in
here,'' he said. ``Since we have a hair and makeup department in
the store, people like to take pictures of themselves when they're
looking all fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   The photo booth may be changing, but people's need to preserve
their best moments may never fade.

IT'S A MANN'S WORLD: WRITER COOKS UP `BY REQUEST' BOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER CUSHMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Betsy Mann has the best of both worlds. She works from
her Kansas City, Mo., home preparing gourmet dishes created by some
of the finest chefs in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Mann began writing the popular By Request column
that runs Wednesdays in ``The Arizona Republic's`` ``food!''
section. Now, she is the author of the new ``By Request'' cookbook,
which features the best 100 appetizer, soup, salad, side dish, main
course and desert recipes collected since the column's inception.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter was born right after I started the column, and
she's been raised on all this good food . . . exotic recipes from
places like the Phoenician and Vincent Guerithault on Camelback,''
Mann said.
</P>
<P>
   Hmmmmm, how many 4-year-olds do you know who wouldn't curl their
lips at the mention of baked goat cheese or foul maudammas
(marinated fava beans) for dinner?
</P>
<P>
   The column's premise is simple: Readers who want to re-create
signature dishes from some of the finest restaurants throughout
Arizona write the paper with a request. It's then Mann's job to
contact the establishment and ask it to share the recipe.
Sometimes, Mann is unable to procure a recipe for readers, but
that's pretty rare, she said.
</P>
<P>
   It's also her job to test the recipes before writing the column.
</P>
<P>
   ``I test every recipe because sometimes things can get lost in
the translation when the chef gives you a recipe for 200 and I have
to cut it down to a dinner for four,'' said Mann, who has a degree
in nutrition and food science.
</P>
<P>
   Mann began writing the By Request column when she and her
journalist husband lived in Phoenix; the couple moved several times
before landing in Missouri. Thanks to the ease of modern
technology, Mann holds a couple of work-at-home jobs. She makes
weekly contact with ``TheRepublic's'' ``food!'' team by e-mail, fax
and phone and works as a recipe tester for the ``Atlanta Journal
Constitution.'' It was through her newspaper contacts that she
found a publisher for her cookbook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel so lucky to be able to cook for a living and still be
able to work at home and take care of my children,'' she said.
``The cookbook just kind of fell in my lap, and it is something I
have really wanted to do for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Anderson, marketing director for Northland Publishing in
Flagstaff, Ariz., said the cookbook is more than a collection of
Southwestern cuisine _ it is an archive of sorts. Because it's
common for great chefs to constantly create new recipes for their
establishments, guests' favorites are sometimes replaced by
trendier dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the case with Chocolate Enchiladas from the Compass Room
at the Hyatt Regency Phoenix. Executive chef Jeffrey Axell said the
desert hasn't been on the menu for nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chocolate Enchiladas were on the menu for five or six
years, and I have had several requests for it,'' Axell said. ``I
think next time I do a menu change, I am going to consider putting
it back on. It's great that I can refer people to the cookbook for
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Mann and Anderson said they think readers will be surprised with
the variety of dishes featured in the book _ everything from the
Fish Market's Oysters Rockefeller to Sfuzzi's Garlic Mashed
Potatoes to Mann's personal favorite: Double Fudge Nut Brownies by
the Embassy Suites Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take the Double Fudge Nut Brownies everywhere I go,'' Mann
said. ``I won a trophy for those brownies once at a party.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By Request'' retails for $9.95 and should be found in most
bookstores. If it's not in stock, Anderson said most bookstores can
order it for you, or you can get it directly from Northland
Publishing by calling 800-346-3257.  &QL;

HOW FAST IS YOUR SYSTEM? WHOSE TEST ARE YOU USING? 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are lies, damned lies and statistics. Then there are
benchmarks.
</P>
<P>
   In their efforts to distinguish products that have increasingly
become interchangeable, computer and peripheral makers are relying
more on benchmark results, ostensibly objective measures of
performance, such as processor speed.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturers see benchmarks as a way to separate themselves
from competitors and gain a marketing advantage.
</P>
<P>
   But many experts say that when benchmark scores are applied to
consumer computers, they are useful in only a limited way. At best,
they provide consumers with one piece of information that can be
used along with price, features, style, upgradeability, support and
other considerations in making a purchasing decision.
</P>
<P>
   At worst, benchmarks can be so misleading that they would make a
used car salesman blush.
</P>
<P>
   ``My advice to consumers would be to ignore most of it,'' said
Keith Diefendorff, editor in chief of the Microprocessor Report, a
semiconductor-industry newsletter in Sunnyvale, Calif. He cited two
main reasons for his recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the hype factor,'' said Diefendorff, who was director
of microprocessor architecture at Apple Computer before joining the
newsletter earlier this year. ``Everybody wants to make their
processor or system look good, so they select the benchmark that
makes them look good. If they ran objective benchmarks and reported
all the results, it wouldn't give the message they want to give.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, benchmarks themselves are not very accurate,''
Diefendorff said. ``Even objective, methodical benchmarks, the best
and cleanest job you can do, seldom represent reality. There is
certainly no one benchmark that provides a single number that
represents what you are going to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Benchmarks are actually software tools that measure the
performance of all or part of a computer system and report the
results as a number. By itself, the number does not mean very much.
It is only by comparing benchmark scores from similar systems that
the numbers begin to have value.
</P>
<P>
   Some computer benchmarks measure overall system performance,
while others isolate the performance of individual components, like
microprocessors, disk drives or graphics cards.
</P>
<P>
   Companies then compare their benchmark scores with those of
their rivals, or they stack them up against earlier generations of
the same product in an effort to persuade customers to upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are indeed important to customers who need to get
the optimum amount of raw performance for their dollars. Corporate
or government customers rely heavily on benchmarks in making large
purchasing decisions. But computer companies have become more
aggressive lately in throwing around benchmark results when going
after the home computer market.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers are being wooed by advertisements proclaiming that,
for example, the G3 PowerPC microprocessor used by Apple is twice
as fast, measured in Bytemarks, the benchmark used by Byte
magazine, as the rival Pentium chip from Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Or that the new Voodoo 2 3-D graphics accelerator from 3DFX
Interactive scores more than 100 frames per second on 3-D Winbench
tests. Or that the new 333-megahertz Celeron processor from the
Intel Corp. is nearly comparable in performance to the 333-MHz
Pentium II, measured with iComp.
</P>
<P>
   But how meaningful are these numbers to consumers? How do they
know if benchmark tests are fair and accurate?
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, consumers almost always have different needs
than a software developer seeking a faster code compiler, a
scientist looking for faster three-dimensional renderings of
molecules or corporate information directors shopping for a new
electronic commerce server _ all specific, targeted tasks where
even modest performance gains can result in substantial time and
money saved.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers usually have more general needs, and benchmarks are
rarely useful for general assessments. At the very least, no one
benchmark test can provide a comprehensive assessment of a
computer.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of benchmarks in use today, some narrowly
focused _ on performance on floating point operations, for instance
_ and others aimed at real world applications, like opening and
using a word processor. There are so many benchmarks, in fact, that
computer vendors can choose the ones that show off their own
systems to best advantage and ignore, or at least not publicize,
the others.
</P>
<P>
   Testers who do not write their own benchmarks have to assume
that the ones used are constructed fairly and that no one is
rigging the tests. Few testing organizations can write their own
benchmarks, said Dean Gallea, program leader in computers and audio
for Consumer Reports magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially we started writing our own application-based
benchmarks and discovered that technology was advancing fast enough
that we didn't have enough resources in house,'' Gallea said. ``We
don't have 100 people doing benchmarks. So we had to fall back on
what was available in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallea declined to discuss which commercial benchmarks his
testers used for fear of enticing vendors to try to tweak their
systems to perform well on the Consumer Reports tests.
</P>
<P>
   But benchmark testing is not the sole province of people in
white lab coats. There are many benchmark programs that consumers
can use to evaluate their own systems, software and components.
Quite a few programs are available on the Internet, but others are
too large to download conveniently.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ziff-Davis's ZD Benchmark Operation, or ZDBOP
(www.zdnet.com/zdbop), says it is the largest independent creator
of benchmark tests for the personal computer industry. ZDBOP says
it has distributed more than 15 million free copies of its various
benchmark programs in recent years in an effort to establish itself
as an industry standard.
</P>
<P>
   (Smaller benchmarks are available for downloading from the ZDBOP
Web site, while larger programs fit only on a CD-ROM disk. ZDBOP
charges $5 for shipping and handling for each CD-ROM benchmark.)
</P>
<P>
   Mark Van Name, vice president for product testing for
Ziff-Davis, refused to say how much money the company _ publisher
of computer magazines like as PC Magazine, PC Computing and PC Week
_ spends on benchmark development each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put an enormous amount of work in benchmarks to make them
applicable,'' he said. ``We have a full-time staff, a couple of
dozen people dedicated to benchmark development. They just build
benchmarks; they don't test products.''
</P>
<P>
   ZDBOP gives away its PC benchmarking programs, which include
Winstone Winbench, 3-D Winbench and Batterymark. (The company makes
several other benchmarking programs, but they are more specialized
for corporate markets.)
</P>
<P>
   The software is revised annually, and the next generation is
expected to be released simultaneously to vendors and consumers
before the annual Fall Comdex computer trade show in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have found that for even moderately computer-literate
people, benchmarks are really useful tools and fairly easy to
understand,'' Van Name said. ``Interpreting benchmark results,
though, is something we encourage people to do with care. Just
remember to do apples to apples.''
</P>
<P>
   Benchmarks are most accurate when the systems being compared are
as comparable as possible. Carrying a benchmark disk into a
computer store to test different showroom models, for example, will
yield questionable results.
</P>
<P>
   One machine may have 32 megabytes of RAM, another 64MB. One may
use Windows 95, another Windows 98. Such variations in hardware and
software can skew the results beyond usefulness.
</P>
<P>
   A benchmark test that shows a 27 percent advantage in processor
speed may persuade a consumer to consider upgrading to a faster
microprocessor, at a cost of hundreds of dollars, when simply
adding more RAM to the existing machine would yield better
performance at less cost.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, consumers need to perform reality checks along with
the benchmark checks. Yes, a system may score 10 percent higher on
a given benchmark, but does that mean it is a better choice than
another machine? Perhaps not.
</P>
<P>
   Performance is just one part of the picture. If the difference
is 50 percent, however, and the benchmark is applicable to the
tasks the user performs most often, the results are certainly
noteworthy.
</P>
<P>
   But even then, consumers should be cautious in evaluating
benchmark results. For example, what about Apple's contention that,
measured in Bytemarks, the Macintosh PowerPC chip is twice as fast
as a Pentium II?
</P>
<P>
   ``The benchmark that we use here typically would not
substantiate Apple's claim,'' Diefendorff said. ``That is not to
say Apple's claim is wrong or false or misleading. It's just that
with the benchmark they use, performance is a lot faster on the
PowerPC part. You can argue which is the better benchmark. Whether
Apple's claims are true or not, if a user went out and bought both
a Macintosh and a Pentium machine and sat down in front of both,
which would he be happier with? That's a different question.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of all the benchmarks in current use, only a few are free and
designed to be run by consumers. Among the most popular are ones
created by ZDBOP and made available on the Web at

APPALACHIAN TRAIL SITES OFFER VIRTUAL WALKS ON WILD SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By VICTOR MATHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hiking the entire Appalachian Trail is a daunting task. Walking
2,160 miles in the woods in six months while carrying a heavy pack
can make one feel far removed from modern conveniences, like
showers, television and computers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But nothing escapes the Web. There are sites catering to
``through hikers,'' those who attempt to walk the entire trail,
usually going from south to north, and to the less ambitious day
hikers. This year's successful through hikers, who started in
February or March, will be finishing in the days and weeks ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Vaughan, 18, of Dedham, Mass., began at the start of the
trail, at Springer Mountain, Ga., on Feb. 24 and finished at Mount
Katahdin, Me., on Aug. 17. His progress on the trail was charted on
a Web site, geocities.com/pipeline/dropzone/1840/, maintained by
his mother, Valerie McKay. Every week or so, Vaughan called home
with news, and Ms. McKay updated the site.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McKay exhaustively chronicled what and how much her son was
eating, and even proudly reported that he had gained weight on the
trail. She described herself as ``panic-stricken'' when she had not
heard from her son for a couple of weeks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About 17,000 visitors checked in during his hike. Ms. McKay said
she had been shocked by the attention. She even received some
``gently irate'' e-mail from Web surfers who were impatient for the
next update, she said.
</P>
<P>
   A few strangers sent packages to post offices where they learned
Vaughan was stopping for supplies; one sent granola bars, and
another sent $5.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the middle of the woods, Vaughan, who will be a
University of Massachusetts freshman this fall, was stopped in
Virginia by a passing hiker who asked: ``Are you Brian Vaughan? I
saw your Web site.''
</P>
<P>
   Still on the trail are Jonathan Griffith and Dawn Wood, whose
progress is being tracked at www.umit.maine.
edu/jonathangriffith/AT. The two 21-year-old college students, who
are boyfriend and girlfriend, began their walk on May 16 and expect
to finish in mid-October.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to offering regular updates on their progress and
photographs taken on the trail, the site has links to descriptions
of what they have passed along the way. So it provides an overview
of the trail for those who do not find the idea of hiking up and
down mountains every day for half a year very appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wood, of Stetson, Maine., and Griffith, of Hudson, Maine.,
were in North Adams, Mass., on Sept. 4. Ben Griffith, Jonathan's
older brother, who helps maintain the site, said he had expected
those following the pair's progress to be mostly friends and
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   But the site has been getting about 300 hits a week from readers
who have been treated to the drama of a meeting with a rattlesnake
in the Smoky Mountains (neither hikers nor reptile was hurt) and
news of the nagging troubles with Ms. Wood's boots.
</P>
<P>
   Armchair hikers can also get an overview of the trail at the
Appalachian Trail site (www.fred.net/kathy/at.html). The site
includes history, advice for hikers and plenty of links to
descriptions of the trail's highlights.
</P>
<P>
   A central gathering point for through hikers is the
www.trailplace.com site. About 2,500 try to hike the entire trail
each year, but only a few hundred succeed. The site offers bulletin
boards where hikers, using their trail nicknames, can offer advice
on what to buy, carry and eat. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Appalachian Trail is kept in shape by hundreds of dedicated
volunteer trail managers. Their site is www.atconf.org. &QL;

   &UR; Why 6-Hour Batteries Conk Out in 40 Minutes &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The batteries for my Macintosh Powerbook 1400c seem to last
for only about 40 minutes each, even though the user's manual says
they can each last up to six hours. How can I get my Powerbook to
run longer on battery power?
</P>
<P>
   A. Apple Computer says that with particular laptop model, the
user shouldn't be too quick to give up. In an article from the Tech
Info Library area of the company's Web site  &UR; (til.info.apple.com) &LR; ,
users are advised: ``There are three warnings before the battery
completely runs out. To truly test the battery life, you should run
the computer from the battery until the third (and last) warning
appears.''
</P>
<P>
   The Powerbook 1400 models come with a nickel-metal-hydride
(NiMH) battery, which, like a nickel-cadmium (NiCad) battery, tends
to have a bad memory when it comes to recalling its power level.
Here's an example of such forgetfulness: If your battery normally
lasts about two and a half hours, but you run your laptop off the
battery for only an hour a day. After about one to three months of
that, you may find that the battery thinks that it has only enough
juice for about an hour before it starts displaying low-power
messages. To help combat this problem, you should let the battery
run all the way down every 30 days and then fully recharge it
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Macintosh Powerbooks, (like laptop PC's), come with software
that will let you give up some performance to conserve the
machine's energy. Other ways to save power include removing any
modem or network PCMCIA cards not in use, keeping your screen as
dim as possible and saving files in progress to your hard drive
less frequently.
</P>
<P>
   If your model has a CD-ROM drive, try keeping a CD in the drive
at all times. The computer will continually check the drive if it's
empty, using up a bit of energy each time.
</P>
<P>
   Circuits invites questions about computer-based technology, by
e-mail to Q&AMP;A(AT)nytimes.com or postal mail to Questions, Circuits,

CONFRONTING TRUTHS ABUT FILE STORAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   Eds: The (equal) at end of story should be replaced by the
symbol)  
 (af)  
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The other morning, as I groped for clothes in my bedroom closet,
I settled for a mismatched pair of socks, leaned down to pick up a
shoe _ and discovered two kittens sitting in my sneaker.
</P>
<P>
   A reconstruction of events led me to conclude that my cat, Izzy,
must have given birth the previous month while we were on vacation.
That, I thought, was a charming story, until I started to tell it
to friends.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of smiling warmly at the punch line _ ``and the striped
one was menacing a shoelace with tiny teeth'' _ most listeners
reacted with horror, shocked that live animals had gone undetected
for weeks in my closet.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that I realized that my housekeeping standards were
perhaps out of step with the expectations of our culture. That
revelation might have upset me at a more vulnerable time in my life
but, luckily, I was still basking in my recent success in another
arena of housekeeping: my computer.
</P>
<P>
   After defragmenting my hard drive recently, I felt I was well on
the way to becoming the Martha Stewart of computer maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   So why not concentrate on my strengths? I decided to convert my
hard drive to a more efficient file storage system called FAT 32,
freeing unused disk space and improving my computer's performance.
The down side was that this plan would require me to understand the
intricacies of the File Allocation Table, or FAT, the method my
computer uses to gather data into clusters and arrange them on the
disk.
</P>
<P>
   I had been avoiding that complicated information for months,
ever since Windows 98 came out, when Microsoft began to trumpet the
benefits of conversion. But nothing worthwhile comes easily.
</P>
<P>
   If Ms. Stewart could so willingly submit herself to learning the
subtle differences between vintage Pyrex casserole dishes, I could
stand to confront a few truths about file storage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of your hard drive as a parking lot,'' I was instructed
by Kim Akers, a Microsoft product manager. ``The parking stalls are
designed to fit a bus. So when you go to store your files in the
parking lot, you drive them into those big stalls. But your files
tend to be more the size of a car so you waste the excess space in
each stall. If you convert your hard drive, you can get smaller
stalls.''
</P>
<P>
   My computer, like the computers of most home users, had parking
stalls that held up to 32 kilobytes of data. Although most of my
files were much smaller, my computer refused to park more than one
in a stall. So whenever I wanted to store, say, a 3-kilobyte file,
I would waste 29 kilobytes of space. But if I switched to FAT 32's
4-kilobyte parking stalls, that same 3-kilobyte file would nearly
fill the space.
</P>
<P>
   There are some caveats, of course. FAT 32 works only with
Windows 98. So if you need to run another operating system, like NT
or DOS, do not convert. Also, if you convert, you will not be able
to use Windows 98's compression tools, Drive Space and Compression
Agent.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Akers said those tools, which squeeze data to make more room
on the disk, were primarily aimed at users who had older machines
with small hard drives. ``If you have an older hard disk with 512
megabytes or less of space, FAT 32 will not work,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But for my 6-gigabyte hard drive, FAT 32 seemed the best option.
By going to Start/Programs/Accessories/System Tools/Drive Converter
(FAT 32), I called up a conversion wizard that promised to make the
process painless. But first, the system asked if I wanted to back
up the files on my hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   I did not, of course, because I am an impatient person and
backing up would take more than half an hour. But in my heart, I
knew that Ms. Stewart would never muck around with her hard drive
without creating a backup. So I backed up.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the conversion went smoothly, with the wizard doing
all the work automatically. The conversion took approximately two
hours, I think. (I was called away during the conversion because my
daughters accidentally let one of the kittens slip outside, where
it ignored their entreaties to return to the kitchen.)
</P>
<P>
   When I returned, I was eager to see how much space I had freed
on the hard drive. Before converting, my C drive had had 796
megabytes free. Smugly, I checked the drive's properties to see how
much space I'd saved and gasped _ there were now only 296 megabytes
free.
</P>
<P>
   Had I done something wrong? I phoned Ms. Akers to find out.
``No,'' she said, ``but you made a backup of your files, remember?
What happened is the backup is taking up extra space. But you don't
need it anymore, so delete it.''
</P>
<P>
   I was confused. I thought I had already deleted the backup, but
now I could not exactly explain why I thought so. In any case, at
Ms. Akers' urging, I went to Start/Find/Files and typed ``backup.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, a large file called mybackup.qic was lurking on the
hard drive. That experience made me wonder, idly, what would happen
if I conducted a search for ``kittens'' on my computer. I decided
not to risk it. As soon as I deleted mybackup. qic, the free space
on my disk jumped to more than 1,000 megabytes; by converting, I
had freed roughly 25 percent more space. But I felt sheepish about
overlooking something so obvious as the backup file.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry, a lot of people do the same thing,'' Ms. Akers
said soothingly. While it may be her job to sound soothing, I
appreciated the sentiment anyway.
</P>
<P>
   She also told me about a nifty tool to download before
converting. Go to (yes, the URL is really this long)
www.microsoft.com/Windows/ Downloads/Contents/AdminTools/
Win98Fat32/default.asp?custarea
(equal)pers&AMP;site(equal)98&AMP;openmenu(equal)prodba
sic&AMP;highlighteditem(equal)features. This utility will estimate the
amount of space FAT 32 will liberate on your hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   As a test, I downloaded and ran it. ``The drive is already a FAT
32 drive,'' it reprimanded. As if I would overlook something so
obvious.

<P>
   &UR; Who Needs Flowers? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I bought a scented geranium last fall, kept it inside for the
winter and then repotted it this summer in a sunny spot outside. It
has grown leaves galore but refuses to bloom. What am I doing
wrong?
</P>
<P>
   A. You're not doing anything wrong, and neither is your
scented-leaf geranium. It's just a misunderstanding. You think
summer means flowers, but the scented-leaf geranium (actually, it's
a pelargonium) knows that spring is for flowering, while summer is
set aside for growing lots of wonderful foliage.
</P>
<P>
   If your scented geranium didn't flower in the spring, you
probably didn't provide the right winter environment to insure bud
set. Most pelargoniums are happiest in a south-facing window with
night temperatures around 50 degrees Fahrenheit and short but very
sunny days. Flowering is initiated in late winter and spring, when
there are more hours of daylight. Where summers are cool, sporadic
flowering may continue, but the foliage is the real interest.
</P>
<P>
   Look past the simple little flowers, mostly in shades of pink
(pretty easy in this case) to see why people become obsessive
collectors. Whether you rub the leaves for their aromas (nutmeg,
lemon, peppermint, dusky rose) or admire them for their intricate
shapes and colors, foliage is what these plants are about.
</P>
<P>
   The variety could keep you intrigued for years. The leaves,
deeply cut, some skeletonlike, may be tiny and tightly crinkled,
looking very sure of themselves, or broad and fuzzy with gentle
lobes that invite the touch. They may be blotched with purple-brown
or edged in white, splashed with cream or just a perfect green,
from light to dark. And while you're admiring, close your eyes and
rub a few leaves. Suddenly, it's an herb garden.
</P>
<P>
   Sources for scented-leaf geraniums include Logee's Greenhouses,
141 North St., Danielson, Conn. 06239, (888) 330-8038 (catalog,
$3); and Fay Brawner's Deerwood Geraniums, Route 4, Box 525 A,
Buckhannon, W.Va. 26201, (304) 472-4203 (catalog, $3).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Two by Two &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. This spring, I planted one Bartlett pear, one Golden
Delicious apple and one Napoleon cherry tree. They are all two or
three years old. I read in a book that to pollinate and bear fruit
there should be two of each kind. Is that true? And do they have to
be the same kind of fruit tree, or can they be different varieties?
</P>
<P>
   A. Some fruit trees can live solitary lives. Others cannot. If
the bees are out, sour cherry, peach, European-type plum or apricot
are self-fruitful, so pollen from one flower can pollinate other
flowers on the same tree or others of the same variety. But most
apples, sweet cherries, plums and pears are self-unfruitful, a term
that causes frowns among both gardeners and grammarians and means
it's time to go shopping.
</P>
<P>
   The Golden Delicious is self-fruitful, but more and larger fruit
will result when there is another apple variety nearby that blooms
at the same time, such as Paula Red or Jonathan. Your others
require pollen from a different variety of the same fruit, and two
would be even better, chosen for overlapping bloom periods, with
one variety in flower and ready to donate pollen during your tree's
early and middle bloom period and the other ready during the middle
and end of the period.
</P>
<P>
   Don't just buy the first cherry, pear and apple that attract
your eye _ plan carefully. If all the trees are to be productive,
make sure that the two apple, cherry and pear varieties can
pollinate each other. Plant a Red Winesap and your Golden Delicious
will be happy to pollinate it, but the favor will not be returned.
Seckel pears and Bartletts won't pollinate each other, and your
Napoleon cherry will barely talk to a Bing. Companion trees should
be within 60 feet of each other. Since any crab apple with the
right bloom period will pollinate any apple, you might be lucky
enough to have one sitting in a neighbor's yard.
</P>
<P>
   Flowering period and pollen compatibility are not found on tree
labels, so check with a speciality nursery or your local county
cooperative extension office.
</P>
<P>
   Fruit-tree sources include Southmeadow Fruit Gardens, P.O. Box
211, Baroda, Mich. 49101, (616) 422-2411 (free price list;
illustrated catalog, $9), and Raintree Nursery, 391 Butts Rd.,
Morton, Wash. 98356, (360) 496-6400 (free catalog).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; String Bean Blues &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Please tell me why my string beans sometimes shrivel?
</P>
<P>
   A. They are thirsty. There are two reasons that they might not
be getting enough water. First, you and nature might not be doing
your part. Most vegetables are primarily made up of water; if it
hasn't rained regularly enough _ at least an inch a week _ you
should have been watering. Second, if your beans are shriveling
even with your good efforts, enough water may not be getting up
into the plant.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility is that the plants are not taking up enough
phosphorus, which is essential for good root growth. It might be a
lack of phosphorus in the soil, or it might be that the pH is too
high or too low, which ties up phosphorus and other essential
minerals in insoluble compounds. Test the soil: the pH should be 6
too 7, and the phosphorus reading should be at least medium.
</P>
<P>
   If the soil is OK, pull up a plant with shriveled beans and look
for fine root hairs. If there aren't any or just a few, you could
have nematodes or wire worms. Rotating your crops _ not replanting
a crop in the same place for three or four years _ should reduce or
eliminate the problem.

CURRY PLANT NEEDS SUN, GOOD DRAINAGE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I am growing ornamental curry in my herb garden, and I am
curious if it is edible or should I just use it in potpourri and
other arrangements. The fragrance is outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   I also purchased two Southern lilac shrubs. Do you have
information on this variety of the traditional lilac in the Houston
area?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; The curry plant, ``Helichrysum angustifolium,'' has
attractive silver leaves that smell like curry. Although this is
not the source of curry powder, which is a mixture of seasonings
and herb seeds, it can be used in some dishes such as egg and
chicken salads. You also, of course, can use this fragrant herb in
potpourri.
</P>
<P>
   Give curry plants sun and excellent drainage. The yellow flowers
make papery everlastings.
</P>
<P>
   I am not sure which lilac you have, but a couple of years ago
the lilac `Blue Skies' (``Syringa vulgaris'') appeared in limited
numbers in a few local nurseries. It was touted as one that would
flower in our warmer climate. Perhaps this is the one you have. I
have no personal experience with this shrub but would welcome any
comments from gardeners who do.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We have a bay tree that is about 8 feet tall. How can we
propagate this plant? Are pecan leaves good for putting in a
compost pile and then using in the garden?
</P>
<P>
   A: Rooting cuttings from a sweet bay (``Laurus nobilis'') takes
patience. Snap, rather than cut, cuttings from branch tips now.
Plant in a well-draining medium. Then wait. It can take six to 10
months for a cutting to root. You might dust some cuttings with a
rooting hormone and see if that helps. Or you may want to simply
buy more plants.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you can compost pecan leaves. In the past, concerns were
expressed over possible toxins, but most professionals now agree
that no harm is done, especially when broken down in compost. We
use pecan leaves in our compost.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I purchased a Japanese aralia (``Fatsia japonica''). I gave
it a drink of water when I returned home, and I repotted it the
following day into a larger pot with soil amended with a small
amount of water-absorbent polymer. I finished the job with a good
watering. Brown spots began forming on the leaves. Each passing day
the leaves turned brown, withered and died. I decreased the water.
I have it in a shady spot. But at this point it looks dead.
</P>
<P>
   A: I think it is drowning. Look for any signs of life. Is there
green near the bottom of any of the stems? If so, prune down to the
green. Check the soil moisture not only in the top inches but at
the bottom of the pot, too. Is it moist? If so, hold off on
watering. Do not water again until the soil is drier to the touch.
This plant needs good drainage. Make sure that when you do water,
the moisture runs right through the soil. Empty any water that
collects in the saucer beneath the pot.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am having difficulty identifying a wildflower. The stem
grows 6 to 8 inches, and the six-petaled white flower has a yellow
center and is open early morning until after sunset. It has a
sweet, heavy scent and closes at night. The seed pod usually has
four to six seeds. These plants seem to grow and bloom from about
the middle of July through September and sometimes into October. I
always let them seed and die out naturally so they will return the
next year.
</P>
<P>
   A: You have a white rain lily, and I believe, from your
description, it is ``Zephyranthes candida.'' These nondemanding
little bulbs take to most any soil and accept sun or partial sun.
They typically begin to produce their starry blooms when the rains
pick up in late summer and fall.
</P>
<P>
   This white rain lily is seen along roadsides, but it transforms
a deep green strip or pool of liriope when you plant the bulbs
among the popular ground cover. Rain lilies are also attractive in
containers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The soil in my flower beds is overrun with pill bugs. I'm
sure they are the cause of death for many bedding plants. How can I
get rid of these pests?
</P>
<P>
   A: Pill bugs feed on decaying matter but sometimes go after
vegetation, and when they do, they prefer young plants. They like
dark, moist places during the day and are active at night. You
probably won't get rid of them completely, but you can decrease the
population. Water early in the day. Use a well-draining mulch. Set
traps: Place decaying fruit or vegetables under an overturned
flower pot. You can collect the bugs in the early morning. You can
kill them, but better yet, drop them in the compost pile if you
have one.
</P>
<P>
   You can also dust bed areas with diatomaceous earth. This should
prove uncomfortable to their soft bodies and discourage them.

   THOMPSON-COLUMN (Washington) _ Bill Clinton must now know how it
felt to be captain of the Titanic, standing lonely and desolate on
the bridge of his mighty ship on a black April night as it began
its relentless descent to the floor of the frigid Atlantic. The
captain had two options. Clinton has three options. No matter which
option he takes, his presidency would appear doomed. By ROBERT E.

   &UR; CITY STREETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Emily Gioseffi and two friends were waiting in line in front of
the Public Theater for tickets to ``Cymbeline.'' The woman ahead of
them was growing increasingly frustrated, glancing toward the front
of the line every few minutes. Turning to the group, she asked if
the line always took so long. One of the women informed her that
tickets to the event were not distributed until 1 o'clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is everything in New York so inefficient?'' the woman
retorted, with an accent that indicated she was a foreigner. She
then whipped out her Metrocard and added: ``Besides, I shouldn't
have o wait, I've already got my ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   The three realized that the woman had been waiting for an uptown
bus to Madison Avenue and had mistakenly thought the theatergoers'
line had something to do with the bus.
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to help, Ms. Gioseffi went to check the bus schedule
posted nearby, but the tourist frantically instructed her to get
away from the bus stop, explaining ``You're not allowed to stand
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The conscientious visitor then read the sign aloud, slowly and
deliberately, ``No standing any time.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. The three directed the woman to the subway.
</P>
<P>
   Bill and Rachel Schultz are still wondering if a seafood bar in
Montauk on Long Island ever succeeded in filling the job with the
description ``Wanted: piano player who knows how to open clams.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're having a Senior Moment,'' my friend told me when I said
I sometimes look for something in another room and then forget what
I came for.
</P>
<P>
   When my cousin came for a visit and said she had forgotten her
house keys, I told her she was having a Senior Moment. She laughed,
and when the occasion arose, and it did, kept repeating it
throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   The second day we went shopping _ she for gifts, I just
browsing. Suddenly I heard her say: ``Who am I buying this gift
for? I guess I'm having .... What am I having?'' We cracked up.
</P>
<P>
   _ DIDA PORECKI
</P>
<P>
   Josephine Dalldorf overheard this exchange at an elevator in the
World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   First Woman: ``What are you doing this weekend?''
</P>
<P>
   Second Woman: ``We're taking David out to North Shore Animal
League to get a puppy.''
</P>
<P>
   First Woman: ``Why are you going all the way out there? You have
a wonderful shelter near you in Mount Vernon.''
</P>
<P>
   Second Woman: ``I know, but they have a better class of animals
at North Shore.''
</P>
<P>
   Another overheard exchange, this one reported by Florence K.
Peate about two elegant elderly women chatting as they waited for
an elevator at Bergdorf Goodman:
</P>
<P>
   First Woman: ``When I die, I've told everyone I want to be
buried in a shroud with a closed coffin.''
</P>
<P>
   Second Woman, sounding puzzled: ``Why?''
</P>
<P>
   First Woman: ``Because if I were laid out, you would look at me
and say `My God _ she's wearing last year's dress!'''
</P>
<P>
   Scene: Columbus Avenue at 85th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Time: Late Sunday afternoon brunch.
</P>
<P>
   Players: A young man and woman, obviously a couple, sitting at
separate small outdoor tables and deeply engaged in conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Observer: Leslie J. Gersing who, on closer inspection, realizes
that the couple are eating at different cafes. He's sipping coffee
and smoking at the French-inspired Avenue. She's eating pizza at
the adjacent Firehouse sports bar.
</P>
<P>
   Who says love requires compromise?
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel Kahn can't forget this conversation, and small wonder.
He wanted a compact disc by Johann Sebastian Bach, so he telephoned
a classical-record music club and asked for the recording. After a
short interval, the operator said that she couldn't find this
artist. Kahn spelled the name and she replied that perhaps the
artist was too new and wasn't listed yet.
</P>
<P>
   J.S. Bach died a few hundred years ago, Kahn said, and he had
previously bought recordings by ``this artist.'' Please check
again.
</P>
<P>
   She came back on the line. ``We don't have anything by this
artist,'' she said. ``He never signed a contract with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Honesty Is Not Always the Best Policy Department:
</P>
<P>
   The salesclerk at the bakery counter of the supermarket looked
at Elaine Green and said, ``Yes, young lady, what can I do for
you?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Green said, ``First of all, thank you for calling me `young
lady,' and second, I'll have a plain rye bread.''
</P>
<P>
   The clerk replied, ``Oh, I call all my elderly customers `young
lady' or `young man.'''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow the bread felt a little heavier to Ms. Green as she
walked away.
</P>
<P>
   The Scene: Vera Institute of Justice Ombudservice booth at New
York State Supreme Court in Brooklyn. The Ombudservice listens to
juror concerns and handles individual juror problems.
</P>
<P>
   First Juror: ``You gotta get me out of jury service. It's
against my principles to judge my fellow man. It's against my
religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Second Juror (interrupting): ``Hey, buddy! How much do we get
paid?''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Maxey, the Ombudservice law intern: ``$40.''
</P>
<P>
   First Juror: ``A day?'' Muses a moment. ``Well, for $40, maybe I
could judge my fellow man.''
</P>
<P>
   Public primping isn't unusual in New York but it's usually done
on a subway or bus, and it isn't often as all-encompassing as that
recently witnessed by Erika Boyd and her husband.
</P>
<P>
   They were standing at a bus stop on 49th Street awaiting a
Waterway Ferry bus when a young woman standing next to them began
her elaborate toilette. She opened her oversize black bag and
pulled out a mirrored compact, lipstick, eye liner, eye shadow and
mascara, and carefully made up her face. She then dabbed complexion
makeup to cover blemishes on her bare legs.
</P>
<P>
   The next stage was brushing out her complicated hairdo, twisting
it into a knot and securing the new coiffure with two long black
plastic hair sticks, placed to form an X. This was followed by the
placement of long dangly earrings and a ring.
</P>
<P>
   Finally she stepped in front of her full-length mirror _ in this
case, a storefront window _ and inspected the length of her skirt
and her overall appearance.
</P>
<P>
   She appeared satisfied. The Boyds were, too. It was a Manhattan
experience. She went on her way _ to a job interview? a date? a
photo shoot? _ and they boarded the bus en route to the ferry and
their home in New Jersey.

tickets to the event were not distributed until 1 o'clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is everything in New York so inefficient?'' the woman
retorted, with an accent that indicated she was a foreigner. She
then whipped out her Metrocard and added: ``Besides, I shouldn't
have to wait, I've already got my ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   The three realized that the woman had been waiting for an uptown
bus to Madison Avenue and had mistakenly thought the theatergoers'
line had something to do with the bus.
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to help, Ms. Gioseffi went to check the bus schedule
posted nearby, but the tourist frantically instructed her to get
away from the bus stop, explaining ``You're not allowed to stand
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The conscientious visitor then read the sign aloud, slowly and
deliberately, ``No standing any time.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. The three directed the woman to the subway.
</P>
<P>
   Bill and Rachel Schultz are still wondering if a seafood bar in
Montauk on Long Island ever succeeded in filling the job with the
description ``Wanted: piano player who knows how to open clams.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're having a Senior Moment,'' my friend told me when I said
I sometimes look for something in another room and then forget what
I came for.
</P>
<P>
   When my cousin came for a visit and said she had forgotten her
house keys, I told her she was having a Senior Moment. She laughed,
and when the occasion arose, and it did, kept repeating it
throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   The second day we went shopping _ she for gifts, I just
browsing. Suddenly I heard her say: ``Who am I buying this gift
for? I guess I'm having .... What am I having?'' We cracked up.
</P>
<P>
   _ DIDA PORECKI
</P>
<P>
   Josephine Dalldorf overheard this exchange at an elevator in the
World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   First Woman: ``What are you doing this weekend?''
</P>
<P>
   Second Woman: ``We're taking David out to North Shore Animal
League to get a puppy.''
</P>
<P>
   First Woman: ``Why are you going all the way out there? You have
a wonderful shelter near you in Mount Vernon.''
</P>
<P>
   Second Woman: ``I know, but they have a better class of animals
at North Shore.''
</P>
<P>
   Another overheard exchange, this one reported by Florence K.
Peate about two elegant elderly women chatting as they waited for
an elevator at Bergdorf Goodman:
</P>
<P>
   First Woman: ``When I die, I've told everyone I want to be
buried in a shroud with a closed coffin.''
</P>
<P>
   Second Woman, sounding puzzled: ``Why?''
</P>
<P>
   First Woman: ``Because if I were laid out, you would look at me
and say `My God _ she's wearing last year's dress!'''
</P>
<P>
   Scene: Columbus Avenue at 85th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Time: Late Sunday afternoon brunch.
</P>
<P>
   Players: A young man and woman, obviously a couple, sitting at
separate small outdoor tables and deeply engaged in conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Observer: Leslie J. Gersing who, on closer inspection, realizes
that the couple are eating at different cafes. He's sipping coffee
and smoking at the French-inspired Avenue. She's eating pizza at
the adjacent Firehouse sports bar.
</P>
<P>
   Who says love requires compromise?
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel Kahn can't forget this conversation, and small wonder.
He wanted a compact disc by Johann Sebastian Bach, so he telephoned
a classical-record music club and asked for the recording. After a
short interval, the operator said that she couldn't find this
artist. Kahn spelled the name and she replied that perhaps the
artist was too new and wasn't listed yet.
</P>
<P>
   J.S. Bach died a few hundred years ago, Kahn said, and he had
previously bought recordings by ``this artist.'' Please check
again.
</P>
<P>
   She came back on the line. ``We don't have anything by this
artist,'' she said. ``He never signed a contract with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Honesty Is Not Always the Best Policy Department:
</P>
<P>
   The salesclerk at the bakery counter of the supermarket looked
at Elaine Green and said, ``Yes, young lady, what can I do for
you?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Green said, ``First of all, thank you for calling me `young
lady,' and second, I'll have a plain rye bread.''
</P>
<P>
   The clerk replied, ``Oh, I call all my elderly customers `young
lady' or `young man.'''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow the bread felt a little heavier to Ms. Green as she
walked away.
</P>
<P>
   The Scene: Vera Institute of Justice Ombudservice booth at New
York State Supreme Court in Brooklyn. The Ombudservice listens to
juror concerns and handles individual juror problems.
</P>
<P>
   First Juror: ``You gotta get me out of jury service. It's
against my principles to judge my fellow man. It's against my
religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Second Juror (interrupting): ``Hey, buddy! How much do we get
paid?''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Maxey, the Ombudservice law intern: ``$40.''
</P>
<P>
   First Juror: ``A day?'' Muses a moment. ``Well, for $40, maybe I
could judge my fellow man.''
</P>
<P>
   Public primping isn't unusual in New York but it's usually done
on a subway or bus, and it isn't often as all-encompassing as that
recently witnessed by Erika Boyd and her husband.
</P>
<P>
   They were standing at a bus stop on 49th Street awaiting a
Waterway Ferry bus when a young woman standing next to them began
her elaborate toilette. She opened her oversize black bag and
pulled out a mirrored compact, lipstick, eye liner, eye shadow and
mascara, and carefully made up her face. She then dabbed complexion
makeup to cover blemishes on her bare legs.
</P>
<P>
   The next stage was brushing out her complicated hairdo, twisting
it into a knot and securing the new coiffure with two long black
plastic hair sticks, placed to form an X. This was followed by the
placement of long dangly earrings and a ring.
</P>
<P>
   Finally she stepped in front of her full-length mirror _ in this
case, a storefront window _ and inspected the length of her skirt
and her overall appearance.
</P>
<P>
   She appeared satisfied. The Boyds were, too. It was a Manhattan
experience. She went on her way _ to a job interview? a date? a
photo shoot? _ and they boarded the bus en route to the ferry and
their home in New Jersey.

   Emily Gioseffi and two friends were waiting in line in front of
the Public Theater for tickets to ``Cymbeline.'' The woman ahead of
them was growing increasingly frustrated, glancing toward the front
of the line every few minutes. Turning to the group, she asked if
the line always took so long. One of the women informed her that
tickets to the event were not distributed until 1 o'clock.

<P>

By LIZ STEVENS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Darwin Mendoza is in love, and it has worked
magic on his soul.
</P>
<P>
   Before he met Muriel, Darwin didn't know he was a Renaissance
man: poet, philosopher, artist, community organizer. But at 53, and
newly coupled, he blossomed.
</P>
<P>
   That was 28 years ago _ not that Darwin's counting.
Chronological age means nothing compared to how he feels. ``When
I'm doing something creative, I have no feeling of age at all,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us experience moments when our birth date seems
hysterically irrelevant: An old friend visits, and the next thing
you know you're making crank calls to your former gym teacher. Or
your significant other leaves a mess in the kitchen, and suddenly
you sound like your mother.
</P>
<P>
   But some people seem genetically predisposed to thinking and
acting ``old,'' or thinking and acting ``young'' _ like the
68-year-old grandmother who wears miniskirts, or the 10-year-old
with a vocabulary to rival that of William Safire.
</P>
<P>
   Attitude can make all the difference between a Darwin Mendoza
and an Archie Bunker. Difficult childhoods, pushy parents and
exceptional intelligence can produce kids who mature much faster
than their peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family has endured a great deal of tragedy,'' says Ken
Seifert, a 17-year-old Mansfield High School senior. At 15, Seifert
assumed the responsibilities of the ``man of the house,'' he says _
making meals for his mother and sister every day, cleaning the
house and caring for the dog and yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been able to develop a maturity level because I
understand what it means to feel immense pain and take on
responsibilities not normally given to people my age,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Cooper knew in second grade that he didn't quite belong
with his schoolmates. His mother, Debbie, knew even sooner. Kenny
would come home from kindergarten quite frustrated. ``Mom,'' he'd
say, ``those kids gave me a headache again today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's 13 going on 45 in most areas,'' Debbie Cooper says. ``He
really is more comfortable talking to adults than to kids his own
age.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenny, a movie buff since age 2 when he learned to work the VCR,
enjoys being different from his peers, though it has made him a
target for bullies at times. He has switched schools twice, and now
attends eighth grade at Monnig Middle School. ``In class, I'll give
an answer and kids will give me a look like, `Whoa,''' Kenny says.
</P>
<P>
   America Online recently spied his Web site and asked him to act
as an occasional host for its all-ages movie chat rooms. They
didn't know he was 13.
</P>
<P>
   Mom is cautiously optimistic. ``I am concerned at times he's
going to be lonely,'' she admits.
</P>
<P>
   Kids who grow up too fast are sometimes the product of parents
pushing them to ``ape older behavior patterns,'' says Fort Worth
psychologist David Welsh. He has heard of 7-year-olds donning suits
and ball gowns to attend ``Titanic''-themed fetes, where ginger ale
``champagne'' and bubble-gum cigars are passed around.
</P>
<P>
   Coaxing children to act older is ``very unhealthy and
destructive and damaging,'' Welsh says.
</P>
<P>
   THINK YOUNG TO STAY YOUNG: For seniors, maintaining a ``young''
outlook on life _ keeping an open mind, pursuing hobbies, fun and
dates _ depends on attitude, stress levels, physical health and
relationships, says Richard Citrin, a psychologist at Iatreia Inc.
in Fort Worth.

   ``One of the factors is how you approach life,'' Citrin says.
``If you have an attitude that you're not getting anywhere, that's
going to create a mindset of powerlessness and frustration,'' which
in turn leads to rigid, or ``old,'' thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Many years ago, Gege Parks promised herself to stay
intellectually and physically active. ``The day I do not learn any
more, I die,'' says Parks, a 73-year-old native Parisian who
teaches French out of her Fort Worth home and at Tarrant County
Junior College.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Mendozas, Parks and her husband socialize mainly with
younger people. Her best friend is 48. They traveled to Europe
together this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedale's Vera Coker took up running at age 68 and just
recently retired her athletic shoes at age 80. ``I don't know how
you're supposed to feel at 80,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Attitude and activity _ including Monday-night dances at the
Senior Citizens Center _ fuel her fire. ``If I die dancing out on
the floor, or unloading groceries at the center or running in a
race, well, that's OK,'' she says. ``I've lived a long life.''
</P>
<P>
   And at a young age, too.

SUSHI GOES MAINSTREAM: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW, EVEN IF YOU'RE A RAW
RECRUIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sushi _ that ethereal bite-size combination of fish and rice _
is becoming downright ubiquitous, even in Texas. We now have
all-you-can-eat sushi buffets. A Colleyville restaurant named a
sushi roll after Cheek-Sparger Road. Even downtown Fort Worth has a
sushi restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   More telling is that sushi is available at the supermarket:
specifically, at Tom Thumb's New Generation stores. The newest
store, on Fort Worth's Hulen Street, is breaking records in sushi
sales, beating out the dozen or so other New Generation stores in
Fort Worth-Dallas, according to Todd Fletcher, assistant store
manager.
</P>
<P>
   The nutritional advantages of these light noshes is a plus, but
a lot of the allure is the intricate marriage of color and texture,
of beauty and taste, of little jewels that are as glorious on the
plate as they are to the palate.
</P>
<P>
   Here's everything you always wanted to know about eating raw
fish but were afraid to ask:
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   A SUSHI GLOSSARY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sushi: Rice combined with a sugar-vinegar mixture dressed with
fish, cooked or, more often, raw. Sushi can be blocks of rice
topped with a piece of seafood, or a roll of seaweed wrapping the
rice and encasing a filling of seafood.
</P>
<P>
   Sashimi: Sliced raw fish served with condiments such as shredded
daikon (a huge Japanese radish), gingerroot, wasabi and specially
designed sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Hand rolls: Conical combinations of rice and fillings wrapped in
sheets of seaweed. Each is worth several bites.
</P>
<P>
   Wasabi: Viciously hot green paste served on the side with sushi,
sashimi and hand rolls. In sushi bars, it is called ``namida'' _
meaning ``tears.'' In Asian markets, you can buy wasabi root
powdered (to mix with water) or ready-made. A dab of wasabi often
glues the fish to the rice.
</P>
<P>
   Nori: Seaweed that has been stretched on bamboo frames to dry in
sheets. You'll find nori wrapping the exterior of sushi rolls, or
sometimes you'll find the rolls wrapped inside out with the rice on
the exterior and the seaweed inside.
</P>
<P>
   Pickled ginger: A palate cleanser, these pink strips of
breath-taking root should be eaten between pieces of sushi.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO EAT SUSHI &QL;
</P>
<P>
   American diners often undo the sushi chef's painstaking work in
a matter of seconds by piling on the wasabi and soaking the rice in
soy sauce, a twofold mistake because the flavor of the fish
disappears and the rice falls apart.
</P>
<P>
   Some diners take a wad of pickled ginger, which is intended as a
palate refresher, drench it in soy sauce, and pile it on top of
their sushi. This is bad.
</P>
<P>
   Masuo Yoshino, a writer and eminent sushi chef in Japan, takes a
liberal position on many points of sushi etiquette. He pooh-poohs
the widely held belief that the only proper way to eat sushi is
with the fingers, turning the fish downward, swiping it quickly
across a puddle of soy, and eating it fish-side down. Fingers or
chopsticks? Your choice. Whatever is easiest is fine with Yoshino.
</P>
<P>
   On the soy sauce issue, however, Yoshino does not budge,
especially the nefarious practice of taking the fish off the rice
cake, dunking it in soy sauce and reassembling the sushi unit. This
practice, he notes, is ``viewed with great disappointment by the
sushi chef.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not good policy to disappoint the chef. It is he who
inspects the fish, defines the character of the restaurant and
determines the success or failure of the dining experience.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   HE'S THE MAN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is no certificate on the wall telling the diner whether
his sushi chef has been trained the old-fashioned way, although all
chefs must pass a government sanitation test in Japan. Sushi chefs
spend five to 10 years as apprentices at a sushi restaurant,
learning how to handle each type of fish and how to bring out its
essential character.
</P>
<P>
   A real sushi chef slices with a deft hand and forms rice cakes
with a quick, magicianlike back-and-forth motion of the hands. He
keeps his sushi counter immaculate. He is poetry in motion,
arranging his precision-cut wares with an artist's eye. Steer clear
of a hesitant chef who turns out ragged-looking sushi haphazardly
arranged.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   SIGNS OF A GOOD SUSHI RESTAURANT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. The counter is immaculate, the display case orderly, with
fish pleasingly arranged.
</P>
<P>
   2. The chef works quickly and fluidly, without being flashy, and
exudes an aura of authority.
</P>
<P>
   3. The rice is not cold, and the rice cake is neither too firm
nor too loose, and is sized perfectly to the fish.
</P>
<P>
   4. The dab of wasabi on top of the rice cake accents the fish
flavor without assaulting the sinuses.
</P>
<P>
   5. The menu offers a variety of species, some of them unusual.
</P>
<P>
   6. The seaweed wrap is crisp and crackling, not rubbery.
</P>
<P>
   7. The chef tells you whether the uni (sea-urchin roe, whose
quality fluctuates throughout the year) is good that day.
</P>
<P>
   8. The restaurant uses snow crab rather than surimi, an extruded
seafood paste with crab flavoring and red pigment.
</P>
<P>
   9. The tuna is lustrous and glistening.
</P>
<P>
   10. The atmosphere is serene.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   HOW SAFE IS SUSHI? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In general, luster and shine indicate freshness, while sagging
and browning edges are signs of fatigue. Eating sushi and sashimi
poses minimal health risks; the Food and Drug Administration has
reported a relatively low number of parasite infections from fish.
Fresh-water fish are never served raw, and any parasites in ocean
fish are killed by freezing. But, as with most food dangers,
pregnant women, the very young, the very old and those with
compromised immune systems shouldn't take the chance, and shouldn't
eat sushi.

<P>
   _  &UR; PART I: ``What Drives Ken Starr?'' (1,500 words) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   During his early career, Ken Starr, a minister's son, was
considered too bland, cautious and reserved to have political
enemies. But Starr changed into a prosecutor so relentless that he
drove a U.S. president to admit his sins on national television.
What changed Starr is unclear. By now, however, Starr's character
has forever altered President Clinton's destiny. (slugged:

<P>
   _  &UR; PART II: ``Ken Starr's Passions: Religion, Politics and the
Supreme Court'' (2,200 words) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was fun, you couldn't do it,'' says a childhood friend,
recalling Ken Starr's religious upbringing _ no drinking, smoking,
dancing or musical instruments in church. It didn't keep Starr from
becoming fascinated with politics, though, and campaigning for
Nixon and Goldwater. Beyond that, Starr's driving ambition, one
that now he will never attain, was to become chief justice of the
Supreme Court. (slugged: STARR-CLINTON-PROBE-TWO- NYTSF)
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; PART III: ``Ken Starr's Search for Truth'' (1,600 words) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   When Ken Starr compared himself to Joe Friday, the detective on
TV's erstwhile ``Dragnet'' _``just the facts, ma'am; only the
facts'' _ it seemed laughable. But today, a search for truth is
probably one of the most charitable interpretations that can be
made of his dogged pursuit of President Clinton. (slugged:

</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; PART IV: ``The Shadow Bill Clinton Can't Shake'' (1,550
words) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Ken Starr has been willing to drive on in the Monica Lewinsky
investigation long after many other prosecutors would have stopped.
Some say he is driven by hate, others by religious values, others
by moral outrage at Clinton's escapades, others by his legal
temperament and love of the law. But at this point Starr's motives
are secondary. The question is, What is to be done with President
Clinton, and how badly has the whole affair fractured the American
body politic? (slugged: STARR-CLINTON- PROBE-FOUR-NYTSF)

 &HT;    CRIST AD ATTACKS GRAHAM, CLINTON
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON Republican state Sen. Charlie Crist picked the day
President Clinton came to Florida to link the president's behavior
to his opponent, Sen. Bob Graham, one of a handful of Senate
Democrats who have publicly criticized the president's involvement
with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Crist launched a 10-second television ad Wednesday contrasting
his and Graham's reaction to Clinton's behavior. The ad campaign
which cost $60,000 is running in Fort Myers, Tampa, Orlando,
Jacksonville and the Florida Panhandle and is expected to continue
for several days.
</P>
<P>
   Crist said the campaign is considering purchasing time on
television stations in South Florida including West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The ad begins with the camera zooming in on a photograph of
Clinton as an announcer says: ``He looked us in the eyes, and
lied.''
</P>
<P>
   It then switches to footage of Graham on the campaign trail
while the announcer declares: ``His political ally, Bob Graham,
called his behavior 'disappointing.' ``
</P>
<P>
   The ad then cuts to Crist standing in front of a jail in
Pinellas County while the announcers says: ``Charlie Crist calls it
'inexcusable.' ``
</P>
<P>
   It ends with a photograph of the Capitol dome as the announcer
says: ``With Charlie Crist, we'll send a message to Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Crist, a state senator from St. Petersburg first elected in
1992, said the ad is designed to ``show clearly and concisely the
sharp contrast between conservative, Republican Charlie Crist and
liberal, Democrat, Bob Graham.''
</P>
<P>
   Crist has urged Graham to call on Clinton to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, seeking his third Senate term, has been one of the few
Senate Democrats to publicly criticize Clinton's behavior in the
Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Graham called Clinton's relationship with Lewinsky
``an irreversible stain on the Clinton presidency'' and said he
would urge Clinton to resign if the president had ``lost the
ability to lead the nation and the world and was incapable of
regaining that leadership capability.''

   RIGA, Latvia _ From all appearances, with his white T-shirt and
baggy britches, craggly beard and boyish good looks, Stephen
Johnson seems to fit the role of roller blader more than that of,
say, an editor in chief.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at age 25, such is his exalted title at the Baltic Times, an
English language newspaper with a weekly circulation of some
10,000.
</P>
<P>
   For Johnson, the Baltics proved to be the land of opportunity,
more so than what America promised for a journalist fresh out of
college.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in the States,'' he said, ``newspapers are looking for
people with experience. The best jobs are filled by older guys.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was on completing college in his home state of New Jersey
that Johnson decided to see what the rest of the world had to
offer.
</P>
<P>
   In the process of knocking around Europe for about a year, he
found that jobs were plentiful on English-language newspapers that
had emerged in the former Soviet bloc countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything there's a shortage of journalists,'' he said. ``We
just hired six people.''
</P>
<P>
   The pay isn't much, about $450 a month starting out, but it's
enough to get by on. A studio apartment in the capital city of Riga
can be rented for as little as $100 a month.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, you'll grow rich in experience. Better to cover
national politics of newly democratic countries than school board
meetings in Smalltown, U.S.A.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' Johnson said. ``The news is fresher and more
exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Challenging, too, judging from my brief encounter.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting with a press minister in Tallinn, I had been
advised that I should submit questions in advance before I could
set up an interview with government officials.
</P>
<P>
   If that's their idea of a democratic press, I said, all huffy,
the Baltics might as well have stayed communist.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he faces similar problems. He'll agree to submit
topics instead of questions, and that seems to satisfy the nervous
bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   But neither is objective journalism as we know it very
widespread, Johnson said. There are Lativan papers, and there are
Russian papers, and the news is slanted accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to other Baltic States, Latvia has the greatest
percentage of Russian-speaking population, about 40 percent. In
Estonia it's closer to 30 percent; in Lithuania, only 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It follows, Johnson said, that in Latvia the tension is greater
between the Latvian population and the Russian population.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they have a very large chunk of people who have no
citizenship,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's because of limitations placed on Russians living in
Lativa. At present, citizenship is being offered by age groups.
Only those people 16-30 are currently eligible.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're 31,'' Johnson said, ``you have to wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans, however, are most welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find the people friendly and agreeable,'' Johnson said.
``Not to generalize, but the Russians seem a little more outgoing.
Latvians can be very reserved.''
</P>
<P>
   Singing in community choirs, for example, is something akin to
their national pastime.
</P>
<P>
   Riga itself is very much like any other major European capital _
Vienna comes to mind _ and tourism in the Baltic States is an
economic boom waiting to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``All three of the countries could do a lot more to improve the
tourist industry,'' Johnson said. ``I don't think they really know
how to attract visitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Does he plan to stay?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, but not forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his success, Johnson misses what America has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss the steakhouses,'' he said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Elliot Gold said it was time his son, Shawn, 24, a
marketer at J.P. Morgan, got his own apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was hanging around at home, making us crazy,'' said Gold,
47, a salesman for an air-conditioning business in Queens. ``Enough
was enough.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Sharon Gold, said that because the rents in Manhattan
were ridiculously high, the only thing that made sense was to buy.
``I couldn't buy because I didn't have the down payment,'' Shawn
Gold explained, with a wink. ``Since my parents agreed to lend me
part of the down payment and co-sign the mortgage, we've become a
lot closer.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Golds helped their son to buy a two-bedroom duplex on
East 91st Street, which he plans to share with a roommate _ one
floor down from a young woman whose parents bought her an
apartment, and down the hall from a young man whose parents helped
him buy one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only one thing, Dad,'' Shawn Gold said, standing with his
proud parents on the stoop of his new co-op building. ``Call before
you drop in!''
</P>
<P>
   With the hot days of summer past, real estate agents, bankers
and mortgage brokers say there has been a marked increase in the
number of parents buying or helping to buy apartments for their
children.
</P>
<P>
   One of the city's largest mortgage brokers, Home Mortgage
Acceptance Corp., reports that ``kiddie co-op'' loans have
increased significantly: up 53 percent from last year, from 47
loans in 1997 to 72 so far in 1998. ``The rents are definitely
driving it,'' said HMAC president Gordon Shanks. ``I've been in the
business 11 years, and I've never seen it like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanks said banks and co-op boards were often reluctant to allow
parental purchases, out of a fear of absentee owners. ``These
people come from out of town,'' he said. ``And just because they're
millionaires, they assume all they have to do is sign their name.''
</P>
<P>
   With the increase in parents wanting to buy, he said, real
estate agents and mortgage brokers have had to become more adept at
picking the banks for mortgages _ and the co-op buildings. Brokers
say board presidents or managing agents will usually tell them
right away if the parental purchase is a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, boards are asking that both the parents' and the
child's names appear on the ownership papers; they may even ask
that a year or two of maintenance payments be placed in escrow.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, Merrill Lynch Credit Corp. introduced a program
called ``Parent Power,'' in which parents pledge some of their
securities for their child's down payment, although they can still
trade them. Mark Crawford, the vice president of marketing for the
securities giant's subsidiary, said that the volume of such
business is up about 30 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it is also because the parents feel safer about making
an investment in New York City,'' Shanks, the mortgage broker,
said. ``And don't forget _ they want a place to sleep when they
come to visit.''
</P>
<P>
   Judy Elias of Houston and her daughter, Maria, agree.
</P>
<P>
   Maria, 24, is just starting graduate school at the Parsons
School of Design, studying graphic design. ``Back in June, Parsons
told us we'd better get our butts out here,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   They looked at renting, but Mrs. Elias, an interior designer,
and her husband, John, an oil executive, decided to buy. ``With
rent, it's like firecrackers _ gone,'' she said. ``We like to come
to New York, and we thought it'd be fun to have a little place to
stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Their ``little place'' turned out to be _ by New York standards
_ a large (1,600 square feet) and sweeping two-bedroom hideaway on
the first floor of a renovated warehouse near Second Avenue in the
50s, a co-op with a full-time doorman. (Because of concerns for
their children's safety, two of the families interviewed would
speak only if the exact addresses of their children's apartments
were not used.)
</P>
<P>
   The Eliases' budget was $300,000. ``After all, you can get a
three-story town house for $270,000 in Houston,'' Mrs. Elias said.
In the end, they paid ``a little bit more than that,'' she added:
close to $450,000.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few blocks away, in the Brevard, a postwar building at
54th Street and Second Avenue with a doorman, Rohit Phansalkar just
bought a one-bedroom apartment overlooking the East River with his
son, Rohan. They paid $151,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``With such low interest rates, I figured it's now or never,''
the son said. ``I was hoping I could save more, but I'm 25 now, and
it's time to be going out on my own.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't so easy. Even though the father, 53, an international
investment banker based in New York, had the resources, the banks
wanted to see the ``correct'' ratio of debt to income for the
owner-occupant, the son. Most banks use the federal loan-to-income
ratio, which, said Shanks, the mortgage broker, mandates that all
your housing costs _ including monthly maintenance or carrying
costs _ total no more than 28 percent of your income, no matter how
much money your parents have.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have had to make $80,000 a year,'' said the younger
Phansalkar, who is a Wall Street sales assistant. ``I don't make
that.'' He paused, then showed his pluck. ``Yet.''
</P>
<P>
   So the banks wouldn't give Phansalkar a mortgage to buy the
apartment for his son. And they wouldn't let him co-sign, to
guarantee the loan. They said he had to own the apartment jointly
with his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to be a co-owner,'' the elder Phansalkar
admitted. ``It makes no sense tax-wise. Plus, he WANTED to do it on
his own, and I said `wonderful.' It's good to struggle a little in
the early years. So I said I'd guarantee his loan. They said no;
you have to be a co-owner. There is logic that escapes me: I
couldn't co-sign. I couldn't buy it for him. I had to be a
co-owner.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a year, Rohan Phansalkar hopes to refinance and take over
the mortgage all by himself. ``Fortunately, in my line of working,
the starting salary is nothing, but it rises,'' said the young
salesman, who will share the apartment with his girlfriend, Jenny
Katsnelson, 20, a student at Hunter College.
</P>
<P>
   How did he feel about having to call in his father to help?
</P>
<P>
   Rohan Phansalkar shrugged. ``It's not a big deal,'' he said.
``He's been helping me for 25 years. I'm used to it. What's one
more year?''
</P>
<P>
   His father nodded. ``I'd much rather help him now than if I died
and left him the money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And didn't you get some help from my grandparents?'' the son
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Er, yes,'' the father said, looking somewhat abashed. ``I
believe your mother's relatives did help us when we bought the
house in Summit, N.J.''

 By DAVID COLMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Joseph Holtzman, the editor of Nest, the artsy new
journal of decor and interiors, does have a few things in common
with his editorial peers, the tough-as-nails sheltertrixes at House
&AMP; Garden, Elle Decor and Architectural Digest.
</P>
<P>
   He, too, knows what he likes and he goes after it ruthlessly.
His criterion: ``At the end of the day, it has to be beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   But any similarity between him and them ends right about the
point where Holtzman _ during an afternoon spent scouting projects
for the magazine _ pauses outside the maisonette on the Upper East
Side where, he said, the writer William F. Buckley Jr. and his
wife, Pat, live. The 41-year-old Holtzman has an outsider's view of
decor _ in this case, literally.
</P>
<P>
   Nose to the window, he contemplated how a peeping Tom-style
photo shoot would go chez Buckley. ``The lights are on,'' he said,
peering in at a leopard skin thrown over a sofa. ``It would be
interesting to see what kinds of endangered species he's got
scattered around in there.'' (The leopard skins in the apartment
``belonged to my grandfather,'' Mrs. Buckley said. ``So I'm sure
they died many, many years ago.'')
</P>
<P>
   While Nest has been frequently compared to Wallpaper, an
irreverent home-design magazine that arrived some months before it,
Nest has more in common with Britain's nonchalantly odd World of
Interiors, the British art journal Frieze and perhaps National
Geographic.
</P>
<P>
   Nest's second issue, now on sale (for $9.70), has some
splendiferous homes, including one by Renzo Mongiardino, an Italian
decor maestro. But it also has an article on igloos, a feature on
how female inmates decorate their cells and another on Holtzman's
own one-bedroom apartment on the Upper East Side, a virtual
jackdaw's nest of design movements, motifs and ideas. The piece,
written by Carl Skoggard, Holtzman's longtime partner, is titled
``Yes, I Too Married a Decorator ....''
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the matter of the ghost editor on the masthead.
Robert Offit, Holtzman's best friend, who died of AIDS in 1988, is
listed as a contributing editor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had an unbridled belief in my talents and abilities,''
Holtzman said. ``I feel that I continue to get advice from him.''
</P>
<P>
   If all this sounds atypical for a shelter magazine, even
Holtzman and his colleagues at the magazine find it hard to express
exactly what is right for Nest. The magazine's first cover _ an
apartment whose every surface is papered or otherwise bedecked with
1970s images of Farrah Fawcett-Majors _ seemed to suggest a love of
kitsch.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong, said Kiera Coffee, a writer whose work appeared in the
first two issues. ``After the first issue, people would say: `Oh, I
know this great guy who collects all this Garfield stuff. He's
perfect for Nest,''' Ms. Coffee recalled. ``That's not it at all.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes a space in sync with Holtzman's vision, she said, is
an urgency, design that transcends the boundaries of taste, good or
bad. ``We're all attracted to people who do things with passion,''
she said. ``And with Joe I'd go one step further and say
compulsion.''
</P>
<P>
   Those compulsions can lead to what co-workers and friends call
Holtzman's artistic temperament. Skoggard, his partner, refers to
him in the article as ``a volcano.'' If so, Holtzman is Mauna Loa
crossed with Woody Allen.
</P>
<P>
   After a childhood spent reading shelter magazines and esoteric
design books in suburban northwest Baltimore, Holtzman, whose
father was a wealthy luggage manufacturer, put off going to
college. His parents were avid art collectors; he, in turn, dabbled
in painting and decorated the large Baltimore apartment they gave
him. He also taught art and stage design at Villa Julie College, a
Catholic school for women.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, he was, as he put it, ``a prisoner of my
analyst.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was too hyper and too obsessive,'' he said, explaining that
the constant decorating, de-decorating and redecorating of his own
apartments were his primary creative outlet. (One reason he thrived
indoors: He has agoraphobia.)
</P>
<P>
   If not for Prozac, which has helped him focus and function, he
contends that Nest would never have hit the stands. ``Really, this
has all been made possible out of a bottle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Five or six years ago, he talked about putting together a book
on his decorating ups and downs with Derry Moore, a photographer.
Instead, Moore urged him to start a magazine. Holtzman sold his
Baltimore apartment, which had been published in House &AMP; Garden in
1989, and financed the start-up. And so Nest was hatched, and began
searching for Gesamtkunstwerk, an architectural ideal in which the
design and decor are fully integrated.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Whether by necessity, as with igloos, or by desire, as with
Mongiardino, the Gesamtkunstwerk is Holtzman's Grail. Last week, on
his afternoon of scouting, he was equally enthusiastic about
fringed lampshades spotted in a window above Buckley's apartment;
about the multilevel apartment where the late architect Paul
Rudolph lived on Beekman Place, and about Aiden Mooney's East
Village apartment, where every square inch of the kitchen has been
compulsively laid with tile.
</P>
<P>
   On his visit to Mooney, a retired Newsweek librarian, Holtzman
pointed out how obsessively the refrigerator and dishwasher had
been tiled, and the inventive approaches to space and lighting
constraints.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's remarkably well conceived,'' he said afterward. ``I love
the intelligence, the subtlety, the reverence for surface. It could
be appropriate for Nest in that it was planned as a whole concept,
and I applaud that.''
</P>
<P>
   And the baroquely modern Paul Rudolph penthouse on Beekman Place
was about as close to Gesamtkunstwerk as Holtzman could ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place is beyond taste,'' he said, meandering up and down
the apartment's countless (and railingless) stairs and over the
see-through floors. ``This is a real vision.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the Rudolph apartment, which occupies the top
floors of a town house on the market for $6.25 million, is in less
than peak condition and faces an uncertain future makes it more
compelling as a story for Nest, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about houses when they've mellowed that's
more palatable to visitors,'' he said, ``the way that varnish on an
old master lends an evenness of tonality.''
</P>
<P>
   Though his passions are legion, there are some things Holtzman
does not like. ``I'm tired of found objects, people just assembling
things,'' he said, adding snobbishly that the stylish eclecticism
practiced by flea-market shoppers is nothing more interesting than
``just good taste.''
</P>
<P>
   This attitude, take note, is from a man whose own apartment is
filled with every conceivable artifact, from a Rothko on the wall
to a bowl of plastic babies on the Studio Alchimia coffee table (by
a precursor of the Memphis design group in Milan) to the colorfully
stenciled lampshades.
</P>
<P>
   There is a Jean Prouve bookshelf from the 1930s holding a
collection of German art nouveau vases, a 19th-century Georgian
armchair and a set of Hermes leather and cane dining chairs. Male
and female mannequins stand watch in the bedroom. Some walls are
lightly stippled, some are pattern-painted over wallpaper and some
are papered with laminated photos, all the same blurry green.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm somewhat ashamed of this apartment,'' Holtzman said, his
eyes darting around the room. ``I don't like to be judged as a
designer on this house,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The apartment, he maintains, is both a ``cut-and-paste job'' and
his sanctum sanctorum to protect him from the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   So why did he choose to publish it in Nest? ``I'm a chintz
slinger first and foremost,'' he said. ``So it's important for me
to put my own stuff out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Or call it a bit of occupational therapy. Holtzman would.

 &HT;    ........................................................
 &HT;    When Kenneth Starr was chosen to investigate Whitewater in 1994,
the White House counsel, Abner Mikva, assured the Clintons that
this was a fine selection.
 &HT;    Mikva and Starr had known each other for years. During the
1980s, the two men served together on the Federal Appeals Court in
Washington, and though they were on opposite ends of the political
spectrum, the liberal Mikva and the conservative Starr were
friends.
 &HT;    Mikva and Starr socialized at each other's homes, dined out
together with their wives. When Mikva thought of Starr, words such
as ``ethical,'' ``fair,'' ``decent'' came to mind.
 &HT;    If Mikva saw a fault in the younger judge, it was that Starr was
a little too much of an egghead, too pedantic, just not
street-smart. This was brought home to Mikva one day during a near
fistfight at the federal courthouse. Starr, Mikva and Laurence
Silberman were on a three-judge panel and, when they retired to the
conference room, it turned out that Silberman was furious with
Mikva over the case they had just heard.
 &HT;    ``Silberman said to me, 'If you were 10 years younger, I'd punch
you out!' ``Mikva recalls. ``I look over, and there was Ken,
looking at the ceiling, wishing he was not there. He never said a
word. I attributed it to the gentle son of a minister who didn't
like controversy.''
 &HT;    And so, in August 1994, Mikva assured the Clintons: ``Ken and I
had good relations on the court and I'm sure it will continue.''
 &HT;    Twice during 1995, Starr wanted to question both the president
and the first lady in connection with the Arkansas inquiries, and
each time arranged it with Mikva.
 &HT;    ``The milieu could not have been more pleasant or cooperative,''
Mikva says. ``Upstairs in the White House residence, both times on
a Saturday. He arrived discreetly through the back entrance. He
later issued a short statement. There was no commenting or leaking
to the press.''
 &HT;    Mikva walked Starr out after one session and thanked him. ``I
said: 'I realize it was not done for this president. I appreciate
your concern for the presidency.' He said: 'I would not have it any
other way. The Republicans will elect a president again and I want
the presidency to be there.'''
 &HT;    Starr was considered too bland in those days to have political
enemies, and if he did, they would probably have been conservative
Republicans. In 1981, as an aide to Attorney General William French
Smith, Starr shepherded Sandra Day O'Connor's Supreme Court
nomination through the Senate and was attacked by conservatives for
having covered up O'Connor's pro-choice views.
 &HT;    After President Bush appointed him solicitor general in 1989,
Starr showed his independence on his first controversial case,
defying the president by siding with a group of whistle-blowers
against defense contractors.
 &HT;    Even after Starr took a million-dollar-a-year corporate law job
at Kirkland &AMP; Ellis in 1993, he was viewed by the Washington
establishment as the perfect man for handling delicate public
matters. When the congressional committee investigating
sexual-harassment charges against Sen. Bob Packwood needed someone
to review the most intimate secrets in Packwood's diaries, Starr
was hired.
 &HT;    His law partners watched him rushing about, installing a lock on
his door, setting aside a special table as the only place the
diaries could be reviewed and declaring that only the office
administrator could carry the diaries in and out of a special
vault.
 &HT;    In October 1995, Mikva left the White House, still on good terms
with Starr. But what happened a few months later radically changed
Mikva's feelings and embarrassed him in front of the Clintons, who
were by then referring to the independent counsel as ``your friend
Ken Starr.''
 &HT;    ``I was shocked when Mrs. Clinton was called before the grand
jury and he made her go to the courthouse,'' Mikva says. ``He could
have taken her testimony under oath at the White House. He knew
there was no back stairway at that courthouse, that she'd have to
walk right in front of the barrage of cameras. Ken knew that
courthouse better than anyone.
 &HT;    ``When he and I were on the bench there in the 1980s, there was
a U.S. attorney, Jay Stephens, who constantly used the press _ he'd
call press conferences in front of the courthouse to announce an
indictment and then haul in the defendant in front of the cameras.
Ken and I used to stand together at an upstairs window looking
down. We agreed that using the press as a prosecutorial tool was
not something an ethical prosecutor did.
 &HT;    ``The Judge Starr I knew was cautious, deliberate, careful, not
zealous and reckless. The Ken Starr I see now is not the Ken Starr
I knew.''
 &HT;    Is it true? Is there really a new Ken Starr? Rusty Hardin thinks
so too, although he draws a very different conclusion. Hardin, a
lawyer in the independent counsel's office at the start of the
Whitewater investigation, says that Starr needed to learn to think
like a prosecutor. He had never been one, had never even been a
trial lawyer, had spent his career in the high-altitude world of
appellate law.
 &HT;    ``Appellate lawyers don't stand up before the Court of Appeals
and call each other (expletive) _ they don't question each other's
motives,'' Hardin says. ``Prosecutors live with that.''
 &HT;    The reserved Starr drove his assistant prosecutors mad,
endlessly weighing and deliberating every matter. ``Starr was more
concerned with what people thought of him,'' Hardin says. ``But the
more the White House stonewalled, the more he hunkered down.''
 &HT;    Over time, his assistants began to glimpse a new fire in
Prosecutor Starr. Frustrated by Gov. Jim Guy Tucker of Arkansas's
legal challenges to the independent counsel's jurisdiction, Starr
argued the appeal himself. The moment that decision came down from
the Eighth Circuit, Eric Jaso, an assistant in Little Rock,
informed Starr that they had won on every point.
 &HT;    ``Ken let out a yell,'' Jaso recalls. ``He yelled, 'Total and
complete victory!' I wrote it on my screen saver _ 'Total and
Complete Victory!' Ken said, 'This is fantastic!' He was excited,
breathless with exhilaration.''
 &HT;    What drives Starr onward? Who is this minister's son in such
relentless pursuit that he forced the president to admit his sins
on national television?
 &HT;    Very soon, this man the public knows so little about will
command the nation's undivided attention. After spending more than
four years and an estimated $40 million investigating Whitewater,
Filegate, Travelgate, Vincent Foster's death and the Lewinsky
matter, Starr is expected to deliver his final report to Congress
in the coming weeks.
 &HT;    For the first time, the public will get Starr's full view of the
president's wrongdoing; the report will also tell us a good deal
about its author and about the quality and scope of the
investigation. Then we will all have to decide: Should the matter
have been dropped long ago? Did Starr lose all sense of proportion?
Or does he make the case for a criminal cover-up worthy of
impeachment?
 &HT;    For his part, Starr is not talking, and has never talked much
publicly about himself. He has granted few on-the-record interviews
in the last four years to reporters writing profiles of him and has
refused repeated requests over a four-month period to be
interviewed for this article.
 &HT;    The only on-the-record interview he has done on any subject
recently _ conducted in April by Steven Brill for his media
magazine, Brill's Content _ landed Starr in trouble with a federal
judge over leaking information to the press about the
investigation. And so, morning after morning, TV crews camp out in
front of his McLean, Va., home at dawn, shooting fresh video of the
man walking to his car with his Starbucks coffee, trying to prod
him into a sound bite.
 &HT;    Nor was Starr willing to permit an interview with his wife,
Alice, although she made the single-most-telling comment about what
their lives are like these days, during an hourlong profile of
Starr shown by the A&AMP;E network in June. ``Sometimes,'' Alice Starr
said, ``it seems like a nightmare that won't ever go away, and I
always think to myself, `It can't get worse than this.' And it
does. Every day it seems to get worse and worse.''
 &HT;    Of course, it didn't have to go on this long. A different
independent counsel might have ended things a lot sooner. In 1987,
James McKay, a Democrat, began investigating Attorney General Edwin
Meese III, a Republican. After a year, McKay concluded that Meese
had broken the law by accepting favors from a defense contractor
and could be convicted by a jury.
 &HT;    Meese's behavior was so troubling that two of his top aides at
the Justice Department, William Weld and Arnold Burns, fellow
Republicans, resigned in protest. But that independent counsel
decided against taking the case to trial; McKay thought the scope
of Meese's wrongdoing was not worth the political trauma that would
be caused by putting the nation's top law-enforcement officer on
trial.
 &HT;    McKay says he feels the same way about the Lewinsky matter, that
Starr has gone ``so far afield'': ``We could have gone off on
things with Meese, but I said no. It makes your blood run cold, the
idea of looking into a case about sexual affairs.''

 &HT;    ........................................................
 &HT;    When Kenneth Starr was chosen to investigate Whitewater in 1994,
the White House counsel, Abner Mikva, assured the Clintons that
this was a fine selection.
 &HT;    Mikva and Starr had known each other for years. During the
1980s, the two men served together on the Federal Appeals Court in
Washington, and though they were on opposite ends of the political
spectrum, the liberal Mikva and the conservative Starr were
friends.
 &HT;    Mikva and Starr socialized at each other's homes, dined out
together with their wives. When Mikva thought of Starr, words such
as ``ethical,'' ``fair,'' ``decent'' came to mind.
 &HT;    If Mikva saw a fault in the younger judge, it was that Starr was
a little too much of an egghead, too pedantic, just not
street-smart. This was brought home to Mikva one day during a near
fistfight at the federal courthouse. Starr, Mikva and Laurence
Silberman were on a three-judge panel and, when they retired to the
conference room, it turned out that Silberman was furious with
Mikva over the case they had just heard.
 &HT;    ``Silberman said to me, 'If you were 10 years younger, I'd punch
you out!' ``Mikva recalls. ``I look over, and there was Ken,
looking at the ceiling, wishing he was not there. He never said a
word. I attributed it to the gentle son of a minister who didn't
like controversy.''
 &HT;    And so, in August 1994, Mikva assured the Clintons: ``Ken and I
had good relations on the court and I'm sure it will continue.''
 &HT;    Twice during 1995, Starr wanted to question both the president
and the first lady in connection with the Arkansas inquiries, and
each time arranged it with Mikva.
 &HT;    ``The milieu could not have been more pleasant or cooperative,''
Mikva says. ``Upstairs in the White House residence, both times on
a Saturday. He arrived discreetly through the back entrance. He
later issued a short statement. There was no commenting or leaking
to the press.''
 &HT;    Mikva walked Starr out after one session and thanked him. ``I
said: 'I realize it was not done for this president. I appreciate
your concern for the presidency.' He said: 'I would not have it any
other way. The Republicans will elect a president again and I want
the presidency to be there.'''
 &HT;    Starr was considered too bland in those days to have political
enemies, and if he did, they would probably have been conservative
Republicans. In 1981, as an aide to Attorney General William French
Smith, Starr shepherded Sandra Day O'Connor's Supreme Court
nomination through the Senate and was attacked by conservatives for
having covered up O'Connor's pro-choice views.
 &HT;    After President Bush appointed him solicitor general in 1989,
Starr showed his independence on his first controversial case,
defying the president by siding with a group of whistle-blowers
against defense contractors.
 &HT;    Even after Starr took a million-dollar-a-year corporate law job
at Kirkland &AMP; Ellis in 1993, he was viewed by the Washington
establishment as the perfect man for handling delicate public
matters. When the congressional committee investigating
sexual-harassment charges against Sen. Bob Packwood needed someone
to review the most intimate secrets in Packwood's diaries, Starr
was hired.
 &HT;    His law partners watched him rushing about, installing a lock on
his door, setting aside a special table as the only place the
diaries could be reviewed and declaring that only the office
administrator could carry the diaries in and out of a special
vault.
 &HT;    In October 1995, Mikva left the White House, still on good terms
with Starr. But what happened a few months later radically changed
Mikva's feelings and embarrassed him in front of the Clintons, who
were by then referring to the independent counsel as ``your friend

 &HT;    ``I was shocked when Mrs. Clinton was called before the grand
jury and he made her go to the courthouse,'' Mikva says. ``He could
have taken her testimony under oath at the White House. He knew
there was no back stairway at that courthouse, that she'd have to
walk right in front of the barrage of cameras. Ken knew that
courthouse better than anyone.
 &HT;    ``When he and I were on the bench there in the 1980s, there was
a U.S. attorney, Jay Stephens, who constantly used the press _ he'd
call press conferences in front of the courthouse to announce an
indictment and then haul in the defendant in front of the cameras.

down. We agreed that using the press as a prosecutorial tool was
not something an ethical prosecutor did.
 &HT;    ``The Judge Starr I knew was cautious, deliberate, careful, not
zealous and reckless. The Ken Starr I see now is not the Ken Starr

 NOTE: Full-length article (8,700 words) available on request  
 &HT;     (NOTE: Editors _ This is Part II in a four-part series.)
 &HT;    .......................................................
 &HT;    Kenneth Winston Starr was born July 21, 1946, in Vernon, Texas,
the youngest of three children. His father, Willie Douglas Starr, a
fundamentalist minister and a barber, put in long, hard hours to
support the family. From the beginning, religion was central to the
boy's life.
 &HT;    ``He's gone to church ever since he was 2 weeks old and never
known any different,'' says his mother, Vannie, who is 91. ``We
just started him from babyhood to know right from wrong.''
 &HT;    When Kenneth was in fifth grade, the Starrs moved to a white
frame house shaded by ash and pecan trees in a working-class
section of San Antonio, where Vannie Starr still lives.
 &HT;    Starr's friends from his teen-age days remember him as bright,
bookish, religious, a little nerdy, totally unathletic but popular,
mature and focused beyond his years. Sam Millsap, who went to
junior high with Starr, lived nearby and, like Starr, was raised in
the Church of Christ. There was no drinking, smoking, dancing, no
musical instruments in church, but a lot of Bible verse.
 &HT;    ``If it was fun, you couldn't do it,'' Millsap says. ``We were
told _ Sunday morning, Sunday night, Wednesday night _ almost
everything fun was wrong and we were going to hell because we were
sinners.'' Millsap, who went on to become the district attorney of
San Antonio, says, ``When I got older I switched to the Methodist
Church so I'd have a shot at heaven.'' Starr attends an evangelical
Bible church.
 &HT;    ``In retrospect,'' Millsap says, ``as I piece together Starr,
the thing at the core of everything is his church faith. Ken was
always independent and sure of himself, his ability and his beliefs
of what's right and what's wrong. He was following his own light _
he didn't give a hoot about the group. When we were in church as
kids, we knew we were out of step with the mainstream, because we
believed what others didn't and we understood we could be subject
to persecution _ it was part of the yoke that made us special.''
 &HT;    The other thing that school friends such as Gary O. Smith
remember was Starr's passion for politics. At Sam Houston High,
besides being a member of the drama club and the yearbook and
newspaper staffs, Starr was president of the junior and senior
classes. As a ninth grader in 1960, he passed out campaign
literature for Richard Nixon; as a senior, for Barry Goldwater.
After graduating, he spent two years at Harding College, a Church
of Christ school in Arkansas, selling Bibles door to door to help
pay his tuition.
 &HT;    But if there is one thing that has struck people who have known
Starr well, both in Texas and Washington, it is his ability to
grow. He wanted an Eastern education. He wanted to see how he
stacked up against different people. He wanted to see how far he
could go.
 &HT;    For his junior year, he transferred to George Washington
University. He did stick out a little there; while classmates were
protesting the Vietnam War in tie-dyed shirts, Starr wore a tie to
lectures. But like most of his classmates, he did not go to
Vietnam, classified 4-F thanks to a case of psoriasis.
 &HT;    The summer he graduated, he met Alice Mendell, a Jewish girl
from Mamaroneck, N.Y., and Skidmore College. They were wed by a
Church of Christ minister and have been married 28 years. It was
Alice, friends say, who taught the minister's son to dance.
 &HT;    After getting a law degree at Duke, Starr was selected in the
mid-1970s for a clerkship with Chief Justice Warren Burger. It was
the first of many times he would advance his career by ably serving
an older, conservative Republican.
 &HT;    In 1982, when Starr was Attorney General William French Smith's
chief of staff, a profile in American Lawyer magazine described the
35-year-old Starr as the perfect assistant, ``deferential without
being obsequious, intelligent without being intimidating ...
anything but one of those arrogant aides who strut the corridors of
Washington.''
 &HT;    Indeed, Jacob Stein, one of Monica Lewinsky's lawyers, noticed
some of those same traits during his negotiations with Starr over
which sexual acts his client might testify to. ``Ken Starr has the
manners of a Southern gentleman,'' says the 73-year-old Stein,
``beautiful manners.''
 &HT;    He is also a workaholic of mythic proportions, even by
Washington standards. ``Ken's smart, but he's not a genius,'' says
Tex Lezar, a former colleague in the Reagan Justice Department.
``He's not this person with a 195 IQ. He got where he is by working
very, very hard.''
 &HT;    Henry Habicht, another Reagan-era colleague, remembers that at
the Justice Department in the early '80s he would be in Starr's
office at 8:30 p.m. discussing an issue as Starr changed into a
tuxedo for a black-tie event. ``He'd come back to the office after
the affair,'' Habicht says, ``pick up work to take home, then be in
at 7 the next day.''
 &HT;    Often Starr had to learn as he went. He became an Appeals Court
judge in 1983, though he had never been a lower court judge; the
solicitor general _ the government's lawyer to the Supreme Court _
in 1989, though he had never argued before the Supreme Court; the
independent counsel in 1994, though he had never been a prosecutor.
 &HT;    An interviewer once asked Alice Starr what she and her husband
did for fun and she said that on Sundays they took car rides in the
country: She drove while he read.
 &HT;    He has put in the same endless hours juggling the independent
counsel's job with private practice. Starr was so busy flying
around the country for those two jobs, plus making speeches and
teaching a course at New York University, that when John Bates, a
deputy prosecutor from 1995 to 1997, wanted to discuss the Clinton
investigation, he sometimes had to ride with Starr in a taxi to the
airport.
 &HT;    Most profiles have portrayed Starr as a career man who still
manages to coach his daughter's softball team and teach Sunday
school, although friends say it has been years since he has been
able to do those things. ``He's a good father for a workaholic,''
one friend says.
 &HT;    It is Alice who is ``so brilliant about organizing their lives
so he has family time,'' Bates says. At an ABA breakfast appearance
in August, as Starr shook every hand in sight, Alice slipped off,
filled a plate with food, quietly set it on the table in front of
his chair, then went back to get him juice. She is also an
executive in a real-estate firm.
 &HT;    While McLean is an upscale suburb, the Starrs live in the same
four-bedroom brick-and-frame house they bought 21 years ago when he
was a young lawyer, a comfortable home but not lavish. They are
known as gracious hosts.
 &HT;    In his most recent financial-disclosure statement, filed for
1996, Starr lists a salary of $1.14 million and assets of $3.8
million to $7.9 million. (Federal forms are vague, requiring that
assets be listed as a range, and it is possible that his worth is
higher, since one trust is in the top category of ``over $1
million.'')
 &HT;    His three children are used to having his work life mixed into
their family time. When Eric Jaso applied for a job as a prosecutor
in Starr's office three years ago, Starr suggested that they meet
for an interview in Princeton, where Jaso was working on a case.
 &HT;    ``I'm waiting in a hotel lobby,'' Jaso remembers, ``and all of a
sudden this man rushes up and says: 'Eric? Ken Starr. Sorry I'm
late, but we're in the middle of a tour of the campus. Come join
us.' And we go out front and there's this wood-paneled minivan and
inside are his two daughters, his son'' _ the prospective freshman
_ ``his wife, plus two Princeton undergrads conducting the tour,
and he says, 'Hop in,' and I sit in the back near his littlest
daughter.''
 &HT;    Jaso took the walking tour of the Princeton campus with the
entire Starr family. ``He and I hung back so he could interview
me,'' Jaso says. ''And then all of us went to lunch.''
 &HT;    Two years ago, Starr's wife gave him a 50th birthday party, and
one of the speakers roasting him was their son, Randall, the oldest
child, who recalled how his father tortured them on family trips by
playing tapes of famous historical speeches.
 &HT;    Habicht remembers Starr testing Carolyn, the middle child, when
she was 5 or 6 to see if she could name the presidents in order.
Today, Randall is an undergraduate at Duke and Carolyn is beginning
her freshman year at Stanford, a year behind Chelsea Clinton.
 &HT;    Even as a young man, Starr ``carried himself very much in a
judicial manner,'' says Bob McConnell, another lawyer in the Reagan
Justice Department. ``I kidded him. He was always trying to be
thoughtful, deliberate.''
 &HT;    All along, friends say, it was perfectly clear Starr didn't want
to be just a Supreme Court justice; he wanted to be chief justice.
 &HT;    In January 1989, President Bush asked Starr to be solicitor
general. It was an honor _ and, for someone whose goal was to be on
the Supreme Court, a political minefield. For days, he spent long
stretches in his office, door closed, on the phone to friends. ``He
was very conflicted,'' Lezar recalls.
 &HT;    Starr had watched Reagan's first solicitor general, Rex Lee,
attacked from the right for not being aggressive enough in
challenging Roe vs. Wade and from the left for being too
aggressive.
 &HT;    ``Ken recognized if he took it, there was a good chance he'd
never get back to the appellate bench, never make it to the Supreme
Court because he'd make too many political enemies,'' Lezar says.
``But he understood that reaching the Supreme Court is kind of like
lightning striking, it's out of your control.''
 &HT;    Starr was trapped. If he said no, he risked alienating the very
president who would select the next justice. But in taking the job,
Lezar says, Starr still hoped the call would come someday. ``I
don't think he ever completely gave it up. It's like a senator who
wants to be president. At some point, time passes you by and you
know intellectually that it won't happen, but in your heart you
don't give up.''
 &HT;    A good solicitor general strikes a delicate balance, primarily
arguing the agenda of the president who nominated him but, when the
law demands, saying no to the president. Starr's predecessor as
solicitor general, Charles Fried, is widely regarded as having been
too much a political lackey of the Reagan administration; Starr is
credited with restoring a proper balance.
 &HT;    On his first tough case, a request from the White House to write
an amicus brief for military contractors in a dispute with
whistle-blowers, Starr sided with the whistle-blowers and against
Bush.
 &HT;    ``He held endless meetings with all the parties involved,'' says
Thomas Merrill, one of Starr's former deputies. ``Starr sat there
like a judge, hearing everyone out, very courtly _ if anything,
excessively judicious. I kept wishing he'd throw everyone out of
his office and decide. He took so long making up his mind to do the
right thing _ but he did.''
 &HT;    Starr argued several cases involving moral issues _ including a
Bush administration challenge to Roe vs. Wade _ but, his deputies
say, he did not discuss his religious or moral views. Prosecutors
in the independent counsel's office say the same. Although he sings
hymns on his morning jog and keeps a calendar with daily Scripture
verses at his private residence, he did not bring his religion into
the workplace, they say.
 &HT;    The main criticism of Starr as solicitor general was also
expressed later at the independent counsel's office: He was
involved in too many outside activities, spread too thin,
constantly touring the country, advancing his name in legal
circles.
 &HT;    Merrill says that Starr could be gone a couple of days a week,
``off delivering some ridiculous speech to a bar association in
Tucson.'' He would send back legal briefs for his deputies, full of
little yellow stickers they called Ken-grams.
 &HT;    ``I questioned these road shows,'' Merrill says. ``He'd make
some dry legal speech and then go around the room meeting and
greeting as many lawyers as he could. I don't know why he bothered
_ maybe he felt like he was building a base for the Supreme
Court.'' Starr's assistants could tell that possibility was never
too far out of his mind. If they were working a controversial case,
he'd joke, ``This will do me in for the Supreme Court for sure.''
 &HT;    In July 1990, Justice William Brennan announced his retirement.
Press reports said that Starr was on the short list of nominees.
But by then, as he feared, he had alienated too many
constituencies. The Bush White House was upset about the
whistle-blower case. Senate liberals felt he had been too
aggressive arguing a challenge to Roe vs. Wade.
 &HT;    Robert Shapiro, a deputy solicitor general, was with Starr in
his office when they heard the news. ``The announcement that it was
Souter came on TV over CNN,'' Shapiro says. ``I looked at his face
for signs of disappointment. We all knew how he felt. There was
nothing. Nothing. Not a single indication of any emotion. Not
one.''

 NOTE: Full-length article (8,700 words) available on request  
 &HT;     (NOTE: Editors _ This is Part II in a four-part series.)
 &HT;    .......................................................
 &HT;    Kenneth Winston Starr was born July 21, 1946, in Vernon, Texas,
the youngest of three children. His father, Willie Douglas Starr, a
fundamentalist minister and a barber, put in long, hard hours to
support the family. From the beginning, religion was central to the
boy's life.
 &HT;    ``He's gone to church ever since he was 2 weeks old and never
known any different,'' says his mother, Vannie, who is 91. ``We
just started him from babyhood to know right from wrong.''
 &HT;    When Kenneth was in fifth grade, the Starrs moved to a white
frame house shaded by ash and pecan trees in a working-class
section of San Antonio, where Vannie Starr still lives.
 &HT;    Starr's friends from his teen-age days remember him as bright,
bookish, religious, a little nerdy, totally unathletic but popular,
mature and focused beyond his years. Sam Millsap, who went to
junior high with Starr, lived nearby and, like Starr, was raised in
the Church of Christ. There was no drinking, smoking, dancing, no
musical instruments in church, but a lot of Bible verse.
 &HT;    ``If it was fun, you couldn't do it,'' Millsap says. ``We were
told _ Sunday morning, Sunday night, Wednesday night _ almost
everything fun was wrong and we were going to hell because we were
sinners.'' Millsap, who went on to become the district attorney of
San Antonio, says, ``When I got older I switched to the Methodist
Church so I'd have a shot at heaven.'' Starr attends an evangelical
Bible church.
 &HT;    ``In retrospect,'' Millsap says, ``as I piece together Starr,
the thing at the core of everything is his church faith. Ken was
always independent and sure of himself, his ability and his beliefs
of what's right and what's wrong. He was following his own light _
he didn't give a hoot about the group. When we were in church as
kids, we knew we were out of step with the mainstream, because we
believed what others didn't and we understood we could be subject
to persecution _ it was part of the yoke that made us special.''
 &HT;    The other thing that school friends such as Gary O. Smith
remember was Starr's passion for politics. At Sam Houston High,
besides being a member of the drama club and the yearbook and
newspaper staffs, Starr was president of the junior and senior
classes. As a ninth grader in 1960, he passed out campaign
literature for Richard Nixon; as a senior, for Barry Goldwater.
After graduating, he spent two years at Harding College, a Church
of Christ school in Arkansas, selling Bibles door to door to help
pay his tuition.
 &HT;    But if there is one thing that has struck people who have known
Starr well, both in Texas and Washington, it is his ability to
grow. He wanted an Eastern education. He wanted to see how he
stacked up against different people. He wanted to see how far he
could go.
 &HT;    For his junior year, he transferred to George Washington
University. He did stick out a little there; while classmates were
protesting the Vietnam War in tie-dyed shirts, Starr wore a tie to
lectures. But like most of his classmates, he did not go to
Vietnam, classified 4-F thanks to a case of psoriasis.
 &HT;    The summer he graduated, he met Alice Mendell, a Jewish girl
from Mamaroneck, N.Y., and Skidmore College. They were wed by a
Church of Christ minister and have been married 28 years. It was
Alice, friends say, who taught the minister's son to dance.
 &HT;    After getting a law degree at Duke, Starr was selected in the
mid-1970s for a clerkship with Chief Justice Warren Burger. It was
the first of many times he would advance his career by ably serving
an older, conservative Republican.
 &HT;    In 1982, when Starr was Attorney General William French Smith's
chief of staff, a profile in American Lawyer magazine described the
35-year-old Starr as the perfect assistant, ``deferential without
being obsequious, intelligent without being intimidating ...
anything but one of those arrogant aides who strut the corridors of
Washington.''
 &HT;    Indeed, Jacob Stein, one of Monica Lewinsky's lawyers, noticed
some of those same traits during his negotiations with Starr over
which sexual acts his client might testify to. ``Ken Starr has the
manners of a Southern gentleman,'' says the 73-year-old Stein,
``beautiful manners.''
 &HT;    He is also a workaholic of mythic proportions, even by
Washington standards. ``Ken's smart, but he's not a genius,'' says
Tex Lezar, a former colleague in the Reagan Justice Department.
``He's not this person with a 195 IQ. He got where he is by working
very, very hard.''
 &HT;    Henry Habicht, another Reagan-era colleague, remembers that at
the Justice Department in the early '80s he would be in Starr's
office at 8:30 p.m. discussing an issue as Starr changed into a
tuxedo for a black-tie event. ``He'd come back to the office after
the affair,'' Habicht says, ``pick up work to take home, then be in
at 7 the next day.''
 &HT;    Often Starr had to learn as he went. He became an Appeals Court
judge in 1983, though he had never been a lower court judge; the
solicitor general _ the government's lawyer to the Supreme Court _
in 1989, though he had never argued before the Supreme Court; the
independent counsel in 1994, though he had never been a prosecutor.
 &HT;    An interviewer once asked Alice Starr what she and her husband
did for fun and she said that on Sundays they took car rides in the
country: She drove while he read.
 &HT;    He has put in the same endless hours juggling the independent
counsel's job with private practice. Starr was so busy flying
around the country for those two jobs, plus making speeches and
teaching a course at New York University, that when John Bates, a
deputy prosecutor from 1995 to 1997, wanted to discuss the Clinton
investigation, he sometimes had to ride with Starr in a taxi to the
airport.
 &HT;    Most profiles have portrayed Starr as a career man who still
manages to coach his daughter's softball team and teach Sunday
school, although friends say it has been years since he has been
able to do those things. ``He's a good father for a workaholic,''
one friend says.
 &HT;    It is Alice who is ``so brilliant about organizing their lives
so he has family time,'' Bates says. At an ABA breakfast appearance
in August, as Starr shook every hand in sight, Alice slipped off,
filled a plate with food, quietly set it on the table in front of
his chair, then went back to get him juice. She is also an
executive in a real-estate firm.
 &HT;    While McLean is an upscale suburb, the Starrs live in the same
four-bedroom brick-and-frame house they bought 21 years ago when he
was a young lawyer, a comfortable home but not lavish. They are
known as gracious hosts.
 &HT;    In his most recent financial-disclosure statement, filed for
1996, Starr lists a salary of $1.14 million and assets of $3.8
million to $7.9 million. (Federal forms are vague, requiring that
assets be listed as a range, and it is possible that his worth is
higher, since one trust is in the top category of ``over $1
million.'')
 &HT;    His three children are used to having his work life mixed into
their family time. When Eric Jaso applied for a job as a prosecutor
in Starr's office three years ago, Starr suggested that they meet
for an interview in Princeton, where Jaso was working on a case.
 &HT;    ``I'm waiting in a hotel lobby,'' Jaso remembers, ``and all of a
sudden this man rushes up and says: 'Eric? Ken Starr. Sorry I'm
late, but we're in the middle of a tour of the campus. Come join
us.' And we go out front and there's this wood-paneled minivan and
inside are his two daughters, his son'' _ the prospective freshman
_ ``his wife, plus two Princeton undergrads conducting the tour,
and he says, 'Hop in,' and I sit in the back near his littlest
daughter.''
 &HT;    Jaso took the walking tour of the Princeton campus with the
entire Starr family. ``He and I hung back so he could interview
me,'' Jaso says. ''And then all of us went to lunch.''
 &HT;    Two years ago, Starr's wife gave him a 50th birthday party, and
one of the speakers roasting him was their son, Randall, the oldest
child, who recalled how his father tortured them on family trips by
playing tapes of famous historical speeches.
 &HT;    Habicht remembers Starr testing Carolyn, the middle child, when
she was 5 or 6 to see if she could name the presidents in order.
Today, Randall is an undergraduate at Duke and Carolyn is beginning
her freshman year at Stanford, a year behind Chelsea Clinton.
 &HT;    Even as a young man, Starr ``carried himself very much in a
judicial manner,'' says Bob McConnell, another lawyer in the Reagan
Justice Department. ``I kidded him. He was always trying to be
thoughtful, deliberate.''
 &HT;    All along, friends say, it was perfectly clear Starr didn't want
to be just a Supreme Court justice; he wanted to be chief justice.
 &HT;    In January 1989, President Bush asked Starr to be solicitor
general. It was an honor _ and, for someone whose goal was to be on
the Supreme Court, a political minefield. For days, he spent long
stretches in his office, door closed, on the phone to friends. ``He
was very conflicted,'' Lezar recalls.
 &HT;    Starr had watched Reagan's first solicitor general, Rex Lee,
attacked from the right for not being aggressive enough in
challenging Roe vs. Wade and from the left for being too
aggressive.
 &HT;    ``Ken recognized if he took it, there was a good chance he'd
never get back to the appellate bench, never make it to the Supreme
Court because he'd make too many political enemies,'' Lezar says.
``But he understood that reaching the Supreme Court is kind of like
lightning striking, it's out of your control.''
 &HT;    Starr was trapped. If he said no, he risked alienating the very
president who would select the next justice. But in taking the job,
Lezar says, Starr still hoped the call would come someday. ``I
don't think he ever completely gave it up. It's like a senator who
wants to be president. At some point, time passes you by and you
know intellectually that it won't happen, but in your heart you
don't give up.''
 &HT;    A good solicitor general strikes a delicate balance, primarily
arguing the agenda of the president who nominated him but, when the
law demands, saying no to the president. Starr's predecessor as
solicitor general, Charles Fried, is widely regarded as having been
too much a political lackey of the Reagan administration; Starr is
credited with restoring a proper balance.
 &HT;    On his first tough case, a request from the White House to write
an amicus brief for military contractors in a dispute with
whistle-blowers, Starr sided with the whistle-blowers and against
Bush.
 &HT;    ``He held endless meetings with all the parties involved,'' says
Thomas Merrill, one of Starr's former deputies. ``Starr sat there

   GRAYSLAKE, Ill. _ Sometime in autumn, after the nesting birds
have migrated, the people of Prairie Crossing go for the burn.
Equipped with water tanks and ``flappers'' _ special rubber mats
for tamping down flames _ they leave quaint new houses named for
Illinois settlers to partake in a novel suburban ritual: burning
the prairie.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, you think you've made a terrible mistake,'' said
Craig Malin, 35, who moved from Chicago to Prairie Crossing, a
667-acre subdivision with a reconstructed prairie at its heart.
``You have to plan ahead. It moves quickly. Now I know why the
Indians called fire `the red buffalo.'''
</P>
<P>
   Real buffalo have yet to make an appearance at Prairie Crossing.
But the leopard frogs, coyote and prairie grasses are back, along
with big bluestem, its legendary stalks so tall they caressed the
withers of pioneers' horses.
</P>
<P>
   The maverick 3{-year-old development, just 40 miles from the
Chicago Loop, is the first major prairie reconstruction in a
residential development and perhaps the most visible symbol yet of
the popular re-emergence of the Midwestern prairie, the oceanic
grassland that Walt Whitman called North America's most
characteristic landscape.
</P>
<P>
   If land is a reflection of human history, then Prairie Crossing
represents the repositioning of humankind and nature: a place where
a winding lane is named Switchgrass, not-so-little houses on the
prairie have built-in recycling bins and cul-de-sacs alternate with
fields of wild onion and prairie dropseed, a favorite of monarch
caterpillars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prairie is part of our life again in a way it wasn't 10 years
ago,'' said Ed Collins, a biologist for the McHenry County
Conservation District, who teaches classes on prescriptive burning
to keep forests in check. ``Americans tend to think of going `out'
into nature and coming back to where they live. At Prairie
Crossing, when they come home they're still in it. That's a
significant change.''
</P>
<P>
   Originally embraced by a coterie of biologists, prairie
appreciation now flourishes at Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co.'s new glass
headquarters in a Chicago suburb, where lunchtime joggers commune
with prairie wildflowers _ a foil for the requisite corporate pond
with swans and ``a less stressful landscape than manicured lawns,''
said Richard Kotarba, the company's director of facility resources.
</P>
<P>
   Black-eyed Susans and coneflowers planted by the city are
sprouting on Michigan Avenue in Chicago, while 40 miles southwest,
the former Joliet Arsenal, once the world's largest TNT factory, is
now home to the 19,065-acre Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie, the
largest restoration of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We bring people out here and ask them what's missing,'' said
Fran Harty, regional administrator for the Illinois Department of
Natural Resources, as he stood on a rise, looking toward the
Kankakee and Des Plaines Rivers in the distance. ``What's missing
is you can see the horizon here in every direction, within an
hour's drive of 10 million people, and not see any buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter he wrote around 1850, an Illinois lawyer named
Leonard Wett described Indian summer days, ``when the atmosphere
was filled with a hazy smokiness by day, and it was often so light
at night that one could read a paper by the fire of a burning
prairie.''
</P>
<P>
   Above Prairie Crossing, the night sky is typically lighted by
wattage from Six Flags Great America and the Gurnee Mills megamall
nearby. The development, which includes an organic farm, a farmers'
market and a community-supported garden, grew out of a 15-year
battle against a plan that would have brought 10,000 people to the
site, versus the 1,500 who will live here upon its completion. (So
far, 125 of the planned 317 houses have been built.)
</P>
<P>
   Conceived as a ``conservation community,'' Prairie Crossing
levies 0.5 percent of the sale price of each house _ an average of
$1,500 _ for a foundation that maintains prairies and wetlands in
the Liberty Prairie Reserve, a 2,500-acre string of protected
lands. Houses, whose base prices range from $199,000 to $409,000,
are clustered to preserve 463 acres of open space and its
topography. That acreage, more than two-thirds of the development,
is largely protected by easements held by the Conservation Fund, a
national nonprofit land-conservation organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're out walking in it every day,'' said high-school teacher
John Estep, of the crushed-stone paths that wind through vistas
that are home to dragonflies, chorus frogs and four species of
grasshoppers. ``It changes constantly. It has so many
intricacies.'' This land was originally prairie but more recently
was punctuated by rhythmic rows of soybeans and corn.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of house hunters pull in, see what they consider to be
weeds, and pull right out again. But prairie was pivotal for
agronomist Karen Wisiol, 62, and her husband, Klaus, 64, who moved
here from suburban Glenview, Ill. Their yard is the landscape
equivalent of pre-Raphaelite hair, resplendent with prairie brome,
a delicate grass with dangling seedlings, and purple prairie
clover, its flowers creating a bewitching yellow halo. The
quarter-acre contains at least 50 native species, including sedges
rescued from a nearby road extension and transported to Prairie
Crossing stretcher-style, on shower curtains in the back seat of a
car.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wisiol is a chapter president of Wild Ones Natural
Landscapers, a national organization dedicated to replacing lawn
with native plants. Bret Rappaport, the organization's president
and a Chicago attorney, became a convert after representing the
``Chicago 5,'' a group of native-plant landscapers whose snarly
gardens were cited by the city in 1989 and 1990 for violating weed
ordinances. (The case was dismissed on a technicality.)
</P>
<P>
   Part of the affinity for prairie plants, he said, stems from the
fact that no artificial life-support is necessary, as with sod.
``The Chemlawn man is dressed up like Neil Armstrong for a
reason,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the rejuvenation of prairie, with its plants like
rattlesnake-master (thought to be an antidote for snakebite) and
compass plant (its leaves are said to have pointed the way across
the prairie for pioneers), there is also a palpable sense of loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty of the prairie,'' observed Vicky Ranney, a
historian who developed Prairie Crossing with her husband, George
A. Ranney Jr., ``comes from the power of what we've lost by our own
hand.''
</P>
<P>
   In Illinois, still known as the Prairie State, the capitulation
of the prairie to John Deere's steel breaking plow _ an invention
of the 1840s _ was nearly complete. In the early 1800s, Illinois
had almost 21 million acres of tallgrass prairie. By 1978, only
2,052 acres were left, less than 0.01 percent.

TCU'S CHRIS KAYLAKIE WILL FULFILL BOYHOOD DREAM AGAINST OKLAHOMA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Near the end of a sun-baked TCU practice
session last week, kicker Chris Kaylakie attacked a ball with such
energy that all concerned were sent flying.
</P>
<P>
   As the ball sailed cleanly through the goal posts, the man who
kicked it landed on the ground with a thud, next to the holder.
</P>
<P>
   A small measure, perhaps, of the intensity with which Kaylakie _
a walk-on _ desires to succeed at TCU.
</P>
<P>
   Another small measure was delivered Saturday, when Kaylakie
capped his first collegiate start with a game-clinching, 23-yard
field goal in a 31-21 victory at Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   But hey, life just keeps getting better. Saturday at Amon Carter
Stadium, one of Kaylakie's most cherished boyhood dreams will
unfold in panoramic splendor.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least, as panoramic as the Oklahoma Sooners can get these
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was always my dream to play college football,'' he said.
``And especially, I dreamed of playing against Oklahoma.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, growing up in Austin, Kaylakie was always wearing
Texas orange in the dream. But this time, purple will do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up, I was a big fan of the Longhorns, and we always
went to a lot of their games,'' he said. ``But I'm happy here, and
it will still be a thrill playing against OU.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up, he was also a kicker, ``beginning at age 3,''
although his career once came to an abrupt halt.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in junior high, we had a coach who didn't like
soccer-style kickers,'' he said, ``so the whole time I was there,
they wouldn't let me kick. But that changed in high school.''
</P>
<P>
   A private-parochial schools all-state selection as a
punter/place-kicker at St. Michael's Academy, Kaylakie was also a
175-pound tight end, an all-district soccer player and an infielder
on the baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   But there were few scholarship offers, so he began looking for a
school offering the educational opportunities he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was always the main consideration,'' he said. ``My father
(William) is a dentist and my mother (Marcia) a linguist, and I was
always looking for the right educational opportunity. I just also
wanted to try and keep playing football, and I was more or less
invited to walk on at TCU. Once I came up here for a visit, I knew
this was it.''
</P>
<P>
   So Kaylakie, a finance major with a minor in Spanish, is an
academic junior looking ``to do a little international business''
when he graduates. In eligibility, he is a redshirt sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't have a scholarship,'' he said, ``but I'm hoping
that will change if I do well this year.''
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for trying to win the job, Kaylakie stayed in
Fort Worth during the summer, working out with backup punter Mike
Cleavinger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were out there every afternoon at 2 o'clock, all summer,''
Kaylakie said. ``I worked really hard, but my girlfriend Emily was
also here all summer, so that made it easier. I just kicked a lot
and worked out with the weights, trying to strengthen myself.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he has added 15 pounds to his 6-foot frame and
feels he can handle any long-distance task assigned to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longest field goal I ever kicked in a game was 48 yards,''
he said, ``but in practice my range is up to 52-53 yards. I have a
lot of confidence from that aspect.''
</P>
<P>
   But TCU coach Dennis Franchione said that it was consistency
that gave Kaylakie a slight edge over freshman Joey Biasatti, who
is handling kickoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have both kicked well,'' Franchione said, ``and I would
feel fine using either one, but it seemed like Chris was just a
little steadier. He's been pretty consistent, but he also has a
good mentality. He's worked hard, and I think he's learned a few
things about himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've sat down with him a few times and talked about going in
with the game on the line in the final moments, something all
kickers face eventually.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't done it yet in college, but he's had several
sessions where I stood behind him charting his kicks _ and it
usually puts some pressure on you when the head coach is standing
behind you, watching. He handled it well.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I'm not worried about that part of it. He's not one of
those kids who hopes he won't have to go in in that situation. He's
one of those who wants to go in and kick it _ and in that
situation, that's exactly the guy you want in there.''

   In the fertility of the prairie lay the seeds of its own
destruction. Prairies have been likened to upside-down rain
forests, because most of the plant mass lies below the soil in a
dense network of thickly matted roots. Beneath the living mat lay
the rich black loam accumulated over thousands of years, which drew
generations of pilgrims with sod in their eyes. The snippets of
prairie that did survive did so in places unreachable by plow,
often tucked away in cemeteries or along railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
   The prairie restoration movement, which in Illinois alone has
blossomed into a network of roughly 8,000 volunteers organized by
the Illinois Nature Conservancy, gained ground in the 1980s not far
from Prairie Crossing with the restoration of prairie remnants
along the North Branch of the Chicago River.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling the words of the writer Wendell Berry, Wes Jackson,
the founder of the Land Institute, a nonprofit educational and
research organization, said the settlers who plowed the prairies
and cut the forests ``never knew what they were doing, because they
never knew what they were undoing.''
</P>
<P>
   To design the prairie anew, Steven Apfelbaum, a research
ecologist in Brodhead, Wis., who was hired by the Ranneys,
consulted the original 1838 federal land survey, which noted a
landscape of ``rolling prairie with scattering timber.''
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of prairie nearby was a revelation to Ms. Ranney,
59, a scholar of Frederick Law Olmsted, and Ranney, 58, general
counsel to Inland Steel, who grew up as a 4-H'er nearby. ``Part of
the difficulty in our generation is that no one knew what we had,''
Ranney said.
</P>
<P>
   The couple planned Prairie Crossing on their kitchen table in
the Hyde Park section of Chicago. Ranney's uncle, the late Gaylord
Donnelley, the patriarch of the Chicago printing family and an
ardent conservationist, fought against what he considered to be
inappropriate development and led eight neighbors to acquire the
site.
</P>
<P>
   Today, announcements about water gardening and children's
programs on backyard habitat take their place on the community
bulletin board alongside notices for yoga classes and the annual
summer-solstice potluck.
</P>
<P>
   An effort has been made to restore not just plants but a
cultural connection. Houses, designed by Margaret McCurry and other
Chicago architects, hark back to the prairie era, many with eaves
and porches. Streets cut a wide berth around groves of Osage orange
trees, imported from Nebraska by settlers as living fences before
the days of barbed wire.
</P>
<P>
   The tamed wild prairie also plays a big environmental role,
controlling erosion and filtering storm water, which eventually
winds up in a lake where people can fish and swim. The deep prairie
roots of native grasses like Virginia wild rye and native fescue,
Apfelbaum said, will cut runoff by an estimated 50 percent more
than in lawn-intensive developments of similar size. ``The prairie
is a nice neighbor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One morning, Michael Sands, the ``environmental team leader'' of
the development, strolled through windswept, burr-ridden thickets
of wild quince and liatris (topped with lavender scepters and also
known as blazing star). He showed off several backyard pondlets
facing the prairie planted with bullrushes to capture rainwater
from residents' gutters. ``They're a part of it,'' he said of
people living with the new prairie. ``It's not someplace with a
fence around it run by some nameless elite.''
</P>
<P>
   At Joliet, the full arsenal of the human capacity to alter the
landscape is symbolized by 396 massive storage bunkers _ ``igloos''
in military parlance _ that loom like apparitions, their material
and intent camouflaged with grass. It is a study in contrasts:
nesting goldfinches in search of thistledown flit past otherworldly
structures meant to buffer explosions.
</P>
<P>
   The arsenal, the nation's first tallgrass prairie, is now the
property of the U.S. Forest Service. It is also the subject of a
new book by the photographer Terry Evans, ``Disarming the Prairie''
(Johns Hopkins University Press), whose photos of prairies have
brought her a Guggenheim Fellowship and a one-woman show at the
Chicago Art Institute beginning Sept. 12.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to convert this decommissioned warscape was a
result of an unusual consensus reached over a 25-year period among
biologists, politicians, environmentalists, local business
executives and veterans. The 29-square-mile area to be preserved as
prairie brims with life _ from endangered upland sandpipers to
voles, the small mammals that Harty calls ``the Big Mac of the
prairie'' because they are so relished by hawks.
</P>
<P>
   Where TNT, antipersonnel mines for the Korean War and cluster
bombs for Vietnam were once made, the physical imprint of humans
is, bit by bit, being erased. Telephone poles, railroad beds and
drainage tiles are being removed. Big bluestem has already made an
appearance, springing up spontaneously in back of an army landfill.
The writer Tony Hiss calls the site ``probably the country's
largest secret garden.''
</P>
<P>
   It will take decades fully to restore the Joliet prairie, which
will be sown with seeds collected from tiny remnants of prairie
nearby. Over time, the land that is now called Midewin (the name,
from the Potawatomi for ``making whole again,'' is pronounced
mid-DAY-win) will come full circle, resurrecting a landscape formed
when the glaciers melted.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, perhaps, the rebirth of this vast grassland of
slender green ribbons and wildflowers tousled by the wind will
depend on the force of humans. ``When the prairie becomes a
national icon like Memorial Day, and the annual burning becomes as
important as the football game,'' said Ed Collins, the biologist,
``then we're over the hump.''

   Theresa Pelzel Thompson is trying to find a recipe for chocolate
cookies that were served at Haltom High School in the mid-1970s.
The cookies were about 5 inches long, 2 1/2 inches wide and 3/8
inches thick. Two were sold in a package shaped like a little
plastic sleeve. The cookies were slightly crispy on the outside and
soft on the inside. They were also available in peanut butter and
sugar flavors.
</P>
<P>
   A reader would like a recipe for potato chip cookies. The
cookies look like macaroons and, of course, contain crushed potato
chips.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Stephens would like recipes for any of the soups served at
the Pink Rooster in the old Stripling Department Store in downtown
Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Jo Beth Dausch of Hurst, Texas, would like a recipe for green
chile stew like that served at Campo Verde Mexican restaurant in
Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn Bisher of Napoleon, Ohio, writes that ``during the late
1950s and early 1960s, Park Place Bakery in Fort Worth made a
wonderful praline frosted layer cake. Would you or any of your
readers have the recipe for this cake? As I recall, it was made in
square cake pans _ three or four layers _ and covered with praline
pecan frosting.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Reitz of Fort Worth, is looking for a recipe that she
remembers being called sponge candy or honeycomb candy, although it

`SMART' GUNS CAN CHECK IDENTITIES BEFORE FIRING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Md., Conn., Va.)   (af)  
 By ANNE EISENBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In May, a New York City police officer was killed when someone
grabbed a .38-caliber revolver belonging to the officer's partner
and shot him four times.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers and firearms manufacturers argue that this
death and many others might have been prevented by the use of what
are known as ``smart'' or ``personalized'' guns.
</P>
<P>
   In one developing technology, a microchip in the weapon stores
images of the authorized users' fingerprints. Another technology
uses radio waves to identify an intended user. In both cases, the
gun will not fire unless an authorized person's finger is on the
trigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We advocate smart guns as a way to prevent death and injury,''
said Susan DeFrancesco, coordinator of the Johns Hopkins Center for
Gun Policy and Research in Baltimore. ``They will reduce the deaths
of young children who pick up guns in the home or despondent
teen-agers who reach for the family gun to commit suicide or police
officers who have their guns stolen by criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Oxford Micro Devices, based in Shelton, Conn., is developing a
personalized gun activated by fingerprints. ``An Oreo-sized device
will be embedded in the gun handle,'' explained Robert Morgan,
marketing vice president of the company. ``When you run your finger
across the sensor, the computer will do the processing to compare
the fingerprint to the stored image.'' Morgan expects that the guns
will be on the market within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Colt's Manufacturing Co. in West Hartford, Conn., is also
working on a smart gun, financed in part by the National Institute
of Justice, the research arm of the federal Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of using fingerprints for recognition and authorization,
Colt's prototype uses radio signals to unblock the trigger
mechanism. The .40-caliber semiautomatic pistol will fire only when
it detects a go-ahead signal from a tiny device carried on an
authorized user's wrist, hand or lapel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The device is so small that a ring, watch or shirt button will
do as well,'' said Marc Fontaine, executive vice president and
chief operating officer of Colt's.
</P>
<P>
   The gun is designed, at least initially, for use solely by law
enforcement officials. Fontaine expects it to be in their hands in
a year and a half.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. DeFrancesco and many other proponents of smart guns
say they are a promising way to disable firearms taken from police
officers or firearms stored in homes, others concerned with gun
policy disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smart guns are a dumb idea,'' said Susan Glick, a health
policy analyst for the Violence Policy Center, a public policy
group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have more than one gun in your home _ and the
overwhelming number of gun owners do _ children can pick up any of
the other guns and kill themselves,'' she said. ``These guns have
the potential to mislead people to think that if the guns are
smart, they are safe, and to discount the risk of suicide, homicide
and unintentional discharge associated with any firearm.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Glick dismisses both the radio-frequency and fingerprint
technologies as marketing ploys of the gun industry. ``Smart guns
are a boon not for children and parents, but for gun
manufacturers,'' she said. ``The guns will help the industry boost
lagging handgun sales by opening new markets. For instance, some
women who in the past feared handguns might now think that they are
safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan countered, ``The guns will in fact be safer.'' Oxford
Micro Devices intends to make older guns safer, and thereby
childproof, as well, with adaptations of its technology for
triggers and gun cases.
</P>
<P>
   Many gun manufacturers, under pressure to make their products
safer, have volunteered to provide locks with new products by the
end of 1999. Most of the locks will probably be mechanical,
released by key or combination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The disadvantage of any mechanical lock is that you have to
fumble for the keys or tumblers in the dark,'' Morgan said.
``Fingerprint technology means you are carrying the key with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Will police officers actually entrust their lives to
personalized weapons?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that smart guns are going to prove beneficial,'' said
Paul Bolton, program coordinator for the International Association
of Chiefs of Police, in Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 10 to 13 percent of police officers who are shot are
shot by their own firearms,'' he added. ``We are hoping that the
Colt prototype will be field-tested by police agencies and proved
to be as close to 100 percent reliable as possible.''

   BBO_ PBP-DODGERS _ VERO BEACH, Fla. _ The new owners of the Los
Angeles Dodgers are considering the possibility of moving the
team's spring training from Vero Beach, where they've trained for
the last 50 years, to Arizona. When Rupert Murdoch's Fox group
bought the Dodgers from the O'Malley family earlier this year, it
also bought Dodgertown, the quaint and traditional Vero Beach
spring training facility where the Dodgers have held their spring
camp since 1948. Dodgertown is baseball's only privately owned
spring training facility, and as such, the Fox group worries it
will cost too much to operate. So, in an effort to explore all
possible cost-reducing options, the Dodgers recently contacted
state government officials in Arizona, to see if any of that
state's communities would be willing to finance a new spring
training facility for them. (Graziano, Lambert, Palm Beach Post)

   BBO_ PBP-DODGERS _ VERO BEACH, Fla. _ The new owners of the Los
Angeles Dodgers are considering the possibility of moving the
team's spring training from Vero Beach, where they've trained for
the last 50 years, to Arizona. When Rupert Murdoch's Fox group
bought the Dodgers from the O'Malley family earlier this year, it
also bought Dodgertown, the quaint and traditional Vero Beach
spring training facility where the Dodgers have held their spring
camp since 1948. Dodgertown is baseball's only privately owned
spring training facility, and as such, the Fox group worries it
will cost too much to operate. So, in an effort to explore all
possible cost-reducing options, the Dodgers recently contacted
state government officials in Arizona, to see if any of that
state's communities would be willing to finance a new spring
training facility for them. (Graziano, Lambert, Palm Beach Post)

 By MICHAEL WINERIP  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 NOTE: Full-length article (8,700 words) available on request  
 &HT;     (NOTE: Editors: this is Part III in a four-part series.) 
 &HT;    .......................................................
 &HT;    Everyone has a theory on Kenneth Starr. After the Monica
Lewinsky story broke, Hillary Clinton called Starr ``a politically
motivated prosecutor who is allied with the right-wing opponents of
my husband.''
 &HT;    Harold Ickes, the former deputy White House chief of staff, says
he sees Starr as a dangerous moralist who views the Clintons ``like
Sodom and Gomorrah and is hellbent on running them out of
Washington.''
 &HT;    Who is Starr that he sees his mission so differently from
earlier independent prosecutors?
 &HT;    In hopes of any insight, I followed him to Toronto in early
August for the speech he delivers every year at the American Bar
Association convention reviewing recent Supreme Court decisions.
 &HT;    He spoke on ``the new textualism.'' Reporters' pens barely
moved. Still, hungry people will take what crumbs they can, and
afterward a dean of a major law school told me that it was a
blatantly political speech, an effort to butter up the Supreme
Court, particularly the Democrat-appointed justices, so they would
be happy to see Starr the next time he argued before them.
 &HT;    ``Did you see all the nice things he said about Breyer and
Ginsburg?'' the dean asked.
 &HT;    Had I missed it? Was Starr sending coded messages to Supreme
Court justices via C-Span 2? Who knew? In time, I learned that
tracking Starr was like following Chauncey Gardiner around in
``Being There'' _ you could read into him almost whatever you
wanted.
 &HT;    I pored over Starr's past speeches but found they offered little
insight into the human being behind the ideas. At Duke University's
1995 commencement, he talked about ``accountability''; at a 1996
meeting of the Economics Club of Detroit, he spoke of ``civic
virtue.'' (He was in favor of both.)
 &HT;    In May at a Charlotte, N.C., bar association meeting, he urged
lawyers to take ``the moral high ground of Atticus Finch,'' the
brave country lawyer in ``To Kill a Mockingbird,'' Harper Lee's
novel, ``who strove to find the truth while defending a black man
wrongly accused.''
 &HT;    In terms of content, the speech was one of Starr's best,
discussing the balance a lawyer must maintain between defending a
client and serving the truth.
 &HT;    But in tone, it was a disaster and widely ridiculed. Starr, the
million-dollar corporate lawyer who represents tobacco companies,
was urging his fellow lawyers to be more like Atticus Finch? Didn't
he know what this would sound like? How much perspective on Ken
Starr did Ken Starr have?
 &HT;    Mostly what Starr talks about these days in his rare public
moments is his search for truth. In the Atticus Finch speech, he
used the word ``truth'' 25 times. In his TV sound bites, he comes
across as some Old World prophet, but instead of wandering the
desert he is rushing in and out of courthouses, hurrying up and
down his driveway.
 &HT;    ``Our job is to get at the truth, and the truth will speak for
itself,'' he says. Or, ``My commitment is to the people and to the
pursuit of the truth.'' Or, in his most famous variation, analyzed
and reanalyzed for its religious overtones: ``There's no room for
white lies. There's no room for shading. You cannot defile the
temple of justice.''
 &HT;    He has also compared himself to Sgt. Joe Friday. (ital.) Just
the facts, ma'am. (end ital.) Frequently, his spokesman, Charles
Bakaly III, warns reporters, ``We're the only ones who have all the
facts.''
 &HT;    But in Washington, other perceptions of Starr also persist. If
you say ``tin ear,'' people instantly understand that you're
talking ``Ken Starr'' and his lapses of political common sense.
This tin ear is partly a matter of being more book smart than
streetwise. In 1989, after his confirmation hearing to be solicitor
general in the Bush administration, Starr called Bob McConnell, a
friend who'd worked with him in the Reagan Justice Department in
the early '80s, to ask how he had come across.
 &HT;    ``I said, 'Everything's going to be fine,''' remembers
McConnell, who was impressed. ``Ken said: 'Really? I watched myself
on CNN and I must tell you, I thought I sounded pedantic.'''
 &HT;    ``Ken, you ARE pedantic,'' McConnell said.
 &HT;    ``I am?''
 &HT;    ``Of course you are,'' McConnell said.
 &HT;    While solicitor general, Starr organized a half-day seminar in
the Justice Department's Great Hall commemorating the 100th
anniversary of William Howard Taft's appointment as solicitor
general. Starr was quite excited, had programs printed, arranged
for several speeches in praise of Taft, contacted Taft family
members.
 &HT;    ``Among the lawyers on the staff, this was a subject of immense
lunchroom talk,'' says Thomas Merrill, one of Starr's former
deputies. To some it seemed a too-obvious sign of his ambition:
Starr paying homage to the former solicitor general who went on to
be president and then chief justice of the Supreme Court. To others
it just seemed goofy: William Howard Taft Day?
 &HT;    In short, Starr has never had a great sense of how he appears to
others. It has been one of the harshest criticisms of him as
independent counsel. Rather than acting as an (ital)independent(end
ital) counsel, he has repeatedly entangled himself with
anti-Clinton forces, making himself appear highly partisan.
 &HT;    One example among many: Starr's public appearance a month before
the 1996 presidential election with Pat Robertson, the
Christian-right leader and vicious Clinton critic, at a celebration
of the 10th anniversary of the founding of Robertson's law school.
 &HT;    Why didn't Starr see his own potential conflicts of interest?
His assistant prosecutors did. Several told me they wish that when
he became independent counsel he had taken a leave from his law
firm and from representing clients such as tobacco companies, which
had a stake in seeing the president weakened politically. But
Starr's aides didn't tell him this. ``He doesn't take criticism of
his motives well,'' one colleague says.
 &HT;    Friends say Starr is so sure he's a fair person, and works such
backbreaking hours to come to the right answers, that he can't
conceive of people questioning his ethics. ``He expects everyone to
apply a legal standard to things,'' says Thomas Yannucci, a senior
partner at Kirkland &AMP; Ellis, where Starr began working in 1993.
 &HT;    For Starr, the fact that his speech at Pat Robertson's law
school had nothing to do with the investigation was the crucial
point, not the appearance of his honoring Robertson the
Clinton-hater. (Indeed, Starr's speech, on the future of the
judiciary, was so dull and academic that reporters had trouble
finding a usable quote.)
 &HT;    ``He thinks, `Why should he be deprived of the right to speak at
Pat Robertson's university?''' Yannucci says. ``He sees it like a
First Amendment issue. He thinks, 'I speak at all kinds of places.'
And intellectually what he thinks is correct, but politically it
does not always wash.''
 &HT;    But even Starr's best friends were caught off guard when he took
the independent counsel's job in 1994 and are not sure why he
wanted it. In 1981, as an aide to Attorney General William French
Smith, Starr had been united with his young colleagues in their
disdain for the independent counsel's law. Starr helped prepare a
legal brief arguing that it was unconstitutional, placing too much
unchecked power in one person.
 &HT;    ``When I heard Ken had taken the job,'' McConnell says, ``I sent
him a note: 'I guess if someone has to do an unconstitutional deed,
it has to be you.'''
 &HT;    Starr's other friends from the Reagan Justice Department had
different theories on why he accepted. Theodore Olson, who is now a
prominent Washington lawyer, saw it as a personality thing: ``Ken
has a hard time saying no to people.'' Henry Habicht thought
religion was a factor: ``Reading between the lines, I think Ken
believed that since God had put him in all these lofty posts, he
had a duty to use his experience when a public-service challenge
arose.''
 &HT;    Still others saw Starr's choice as a career decision by a man
who had lost some of his taste for corporate law. Some say he
wanted to be back in the public spotlight. Anyone who has seen
Starr work a room would swear he's running for something.
 &HT;    At the ABA convention in Toronto, he attended a prayer breakfast
in addition to delivering his speech, and at each event he roved
the banquet hall, shaking hundreds of hands, hugging women, signing
autographs, posing for photos.
 &HT;    ``He's really eating this up, isn't he?'' one ABA staff member
said. After Elizabeth Dole's speech at the prayer breakfast,
several people came up to Starr and said, ``God bless you _ keep up
the good work.''
 &HT;    There is probably some truth in a variety of motivations _ that
Starr had no love for Clinton, felt a civic and religious duty, was
bored in his law job, wanted more attention, had trouble saying no.
Yet no single explanation seems sufficient. If he was part of a
vast right-wing conspiracy devoted to nailing the president, why
did he try to leave the independent counsel's job in 1997 to be a
dean at Pepperdine University?
 &HT;    Rusty Hardin, a prosecutor in the independent counsel's office
at the start of the Whitewater investigation, says that in 1994,
Starr did not have a clue what he was taking on.
 &HT;    ``He thought he could parachute in, do it in a year or two, not
consume his whole life and get out. He misjudged. He'd never been
in the national spotlight. He still thought like an appellate
lawyer _ that cases would be decided on their merits.''

 &HT;    ``Ken, you ARE pedantic,'' McConnell said.
 &HT;    ``I am?''
 &HT;    ``Of course you are,'' McConnell said.
 &HT;    While solicitor general, Starr organized a half-day seminar in
the Justice Department's Great Hall commemorating the 100th
anniversary of William Howard Taft's appointment as solicitor
general. Starr was quite excited, had programs printed, arranged
for several speeches in praise of Taft, contacted Taft family
members.
 &HT;    ``Among the lawyers on the staff, this was a subject of immense
lunchroom talk,'' says Thomas Merrill, one of Starr's former
deputies. To some it seemed a too-obvious sign of his ambition:
Starr paying homage to the former solicitor general who went on to
be president and then chief justice of the Supreme Court. To others
it just seemed goofy: William Howard Taft Day?
 &HT;    In short, Starr has never had a great sense of how he appears to
others. It has been one of the harshest criticisms of him as
independent counsel. Rather than acting as an (ital)independent(end
ital) counsel, he has repeatedly entangled himself with
anti-Clinton forces, making himself appear highly partisan.
 &HT;    One example among many: Starr's public appearance a month before
the 1996 presidential election with Pat Robertson, the
Christian-right leader and vicious Clinton critic, at a celebration
of the 10th anniversary of the founding of Robertson's law school.
 &HT;    Why didn't Starr see his own potential conflicts of interest?
His assistant prosecutors did. Several told me they wish that when
he became independent counsel he had taken a leave from his law
firm and from representing clients such as tobacco companies, which
had a stake in seeing the president weakened politically. But
Starr's aides didn't tell him this. ``He doesn't take criticism of
his motives well,'' one colleague says.
 &HT;    Friends say Starr is so sure he's a fair person, and works such
backbreaking hours to come to the right answers, that he can't
conceive of people questioning his ethics. ``He expects everyone to
apply a legal standard to things,'' says Thomas Yannucci, a senior
partner at Kirkland &AMP; Ellis, where Starr began working in 1993.
 &HT;    For Starr, the fact that his speech at Pat Robertson's law
school had nothing to do with the investigation was the crucial
point, not the appearance of his honoring Robertson the
Clinton-hater. (Indeed, Starr's speech, on the future of the
judiciary, was so dull and academic that reporters had trouble
finding a usable quote.)
 &HT;    ``He thinks, `Why should he be deprived of the right to speak at
Pat Robertson's university?''' Yannucci says. ``He sees it like a
First Amendment issue. He thinks, 'I speak at all kinds of places.'
And intellectually what he thinks is correct, but politically it
does not always wash.''
 &HT;    But even Starr's best friends were caught off guard when he took
the independent counsel's job in 1994 and are not sure why he
wanted it. In 1981, as an aide to Attorney General William French
Smith, Starr had been united with his young colleagues in their
disdain for the independent counsel's law. Starr helped prepare a
legal brief arguing that it was unconstitutional, placing too much
unchecked power in one person.
 &HT;    ``When I heard Ken had taken the job,'' McConnell says, ``I sent
him a note: 'I guess if someone has to do an unconstitutional deed,
it has to be you.'''
 &HT;    Starr's other friends from the Reagan Justice Department had
different theories on why he accepted. Theodore Olson, who is now a
prominent Washington lawyer, saw it as a personality thing: ``Ken
has a hard time saying no to people.'' Henry Habicht thought
religion was a factor: ``Reading between the lines, I think Ken
believed that since God had put him in all these lofty posts, he
had a duty to use his experience when a public-service challenge
arose.''
 &HT;    Still others saw Starr's choice as a career decision by a man
who had lost some of his taste for corporate law. Some say he
wanted to be back in the public spotlight. Anyone who has seen
Starr work a room would swear he's running for something.
 &HT;    At the ABA convention in Toronto, he attended a prayer breakfast
in addition to delivering his speech, and at each event he roved
the banquet hall, shaking hundreds of hands, hugging women, signing
autographs, posing for photos.
 &HT;    ``He's really eating this up, isn't he?'' one ABA staff member
said. After Elizabeth Dole's speech at the prayer breakfast,
several people came up to Starr and said, ``God bless you _ keep up
the good work.''
 &HT;    There is probably some truth in a variety of motivations _ that
Starr had no love for Clinton, felt a civic and religious duty, was
bored in his law job, wanted more attention, had trouble saying no.
Yet no single explanation seems sufficient. If he was part of a
vast right-wing conspiracy devoted to nailing the president, why
did he try to leave the independent counsel's job in 1997 to be a
dean at Pepperdine University?
 &HT;    Rusty Hardin, a prosecutor in the independent counsel's office
at the start of the Whitewater investigation, says that in 1994,
Starr did not have a clue what he was taking on.
 &HT;    ``He thought he could parachute in, do it in a year or two, not
consume his whole life and get out. He misjudged. He'd never been
in the national spotlight. He still thought like an appellate
lawyer _ that cases would be decided on their merits.''

 &HT;    .............................................
 &HT;    Another prosecutor might have formed a different perspective on
an American president who lied about sex in a dismissed civil suit.
 &HT;    Another prosecutor could have ended the Monica Lewinsky inquiry
long ago.
 &HT;    James McKay, the Democratic independent counsel who in 1987
began investigating Republican Attorney General Meese III _ and
opted to avoid the political trauma of a trial for the nation's top
law-enforcement officer _ says that not prosecuting is one of the
hardest decisions a prosecutor makes.
 &HT;    Even within Starr's own office, there was dissent among seasoned
prosecutors over how hard to pursue the Lewinsky investigation. Two
of Starr's assistants, Michael Emmick and Bruce Udolf, argued for
accepting Lewinsky's first proffer in January, then running a swift
investigation and turning a report over to Congress in 60 days.
 &HT;    In typical Starr fashion, these issues were debated endlessly.
Over time, Starr sided with other assistants _ two of his deputies,
Robert Bittman, whom Starr affectionately calls Bulldog, and Jackie
Bennett, known among fellow prosecutors as the office expert on the
president's sex life long before anyone had heard of Lewinsky.
Ultimately, Starr opted for an investigation that would turn up
every last fact.
 &HT;    He fought up to the Supreme Court to get Clinton's Secret
Service guards to testify, up to the Supreme Court trying to get
hold of the notes of the lawyer for the late Vince Foster. Starr
pushed normal prosecutorial practices to the limit by calling
Lewinsky's mother before the grand jury.
 &HT;    It all reflected a big change in Starr. At some point, the
reserved appellate lawyer decided he would do whatever it took
within the limits of the law to squeeze people for his
investigations. He had come to realize that the White House was
going to do what defense lawyers almost always do during criminal
investigations: delay, stall, buy time.
 &HT;    What was the turning point for Starr? His assistant prosecutors
cannot pinpoint it, and who knows if even Starr can. This much is
clear: By the time Lewinsky appeared on the scene, he was poised
for an all-out assault. As to whether he was overzealous and
irresponsible or was simply ``becoming a prosecutor,'' as Rusty
Hardin, his former colleague at the beginning of the Whitewater
investigation believes _ that will depend on what is in his final
report.
 &HT;    What we do know is that Starr was willing to drive on when so
many other prosecutors would have stopped.
 &HT;    Part of the reason is Starr's legal temperament. All his
professional life, before reaching a decision, he has doggedly
pursued every last fact. His friends say it over and over: ``Ken is
determined that no one will defeat him by outworking him.''
 &HT;    As solicitor general in the Bush administration, the first case
he argued before the Supreme Court was an old-fashioned
civil-rights matter left over from the Carter era that forced the
City of Yonkers to remedy past discrimination by racially balancing
its public housing and schools. That couldn't have been a case
Starr had much political sympathy for, and yet his aides remember
his exhaustive preparation.
 &HT;    When he lost, says Robert Shapiro, a former deputy solicitor
general, ``Ken took it very hard.'' He hates to lose.
 &HT;    Starr also has a scholarly, at times pedantic, love for the law
and is genuinely offended that anyone, let alone the president of
the United States, would denigrate it. In his May ``Atticus Finch''
speech at the Charlotte, N.C., bar association, invoking the
beloved character in ``To Kill a Mockingbird,'' Starr warned that
the single biggest problem facing lawyers today is ``loss of
respect for the truth.''
 &HT;    While Starr wants to be liked, he was also raised to have
confidence in his beliefs even if most people don't agree. A detail
such as a 19 percent approval rating in the polls isn't going to
deter Starr.
 &HT;    As for his career, he had little at stake anymore. When he tried
to leave the independent counsel's job in 1997 to be a dean at
Pepperdine University, he changed his mind a few days after the
announcement due to an uproar from the press and his prosecutors;
he couldn't escape. His great dream, the Supreme Court, had long
passed. His next most likely steps _ academia and corporate law _
are assured no matter how this investigation turns out.
 &HT;    Indeed, a senior partner at Kirkland &AMP; Ellis, Thomas Yannucci,
who is close to him, says that Starr, despite taking an unpaid
leave of absence from the firm in July, plans to return when this
is all over. In what may be the understatement of the year,
Yannucci says, ``Now that he's taken on his public duty, I don't
think he has the same view of public service.''
 &HT;    Did Starr come to hate the president _ did that drive him too?
The answer is probably yes, although not at first, and not until he
felt that the White House was stonewalling. I asked John Bates, a
deputy prosecutor from 1995 to 1997, whether Starr hates Clinton.
 &HT;    Bates was quiet a long time and then gave an answer so
convoluted that I stopped taking notes. I asked again, Did Starr
hate Clinton? ``I think Ken is very upset at how personal and
political the attacks on him, the office and others in the office
have become,'' he said.
 &HT;    Did moral outrage at Clinton's sexual escapades also fuel
Starr's investigation? Lawyers who have sat with him at meetings
when these details were discussed say they could tell that Starr
was offended.
 &HT;    But when asked for a single example, a single comment or
outburst, they could not provide one. They answered that it was
subtle, in the wrinkle of an eyebrow or a quiet grimace. They had
heard his deputies make lewd remarks, but not Starr; he was too
professional for that.
 &HT;    We do know that Starr was raised to take a hard line against
such behavior. When his mother was asked for this article what she
wanted Americans to think of her son, she answered, ``I want them
to think of a man who believes in doing right and a man who does
not cheat on his wife, like Clinton has on his wife.''
 &HT;    All this said, in the end Starr's motives no longer matter. That
is his victory, his measure of vindication. It no longer matters if
malicious right-wingers consorted with his office to lay a trap for
the president, if prudishness or ambition or even radio waves from
outer space drove Ken Starr. The president has admitted misleading
the American public. He lied. Through Starr's doggedness, his
relentless effort to amass every last fact, he has succeeded in
making his investigation about Bill Clinton, not about Ken Starr.
 &HT;    All Clinton's life, the man from Hope has relied on his brains,
his charm, his boyishness, his uncanny political instincts, his
superhuman energy to squeeze through tight spots. Not this time.
This time Starr built such a wall of facts that Clinton had no
place to go. On Aug. 17, 1998, at 10 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time,
Clinton hit that wall. It was not a pretty sight.
 &HT;    Which is not to say that Starr has scored his total and complete
victory. This may or may not turn out to be about obstructing
justice, but regardless, it is lots and lots about sex, and no one
wins when such private matters are made public.
 &HT;    All who became embroiled in the Lewinsky case _ the White House,
the press and the prosecutors, too _ dirtied themselves. When Starr
needed someone to show the American public that he was acting
fairly, he hired the Watergate hero Sam Dash as his ethics adviser.
Within Starr's office, Dash is referred to as ``our secret
weapon.''
 &HT;    A generation from now, if there is another president who needs
investigating, will the special prosecutor of that era hire Starr
as his secret weapon? Not likely.
 &HT;    Once Starr drops his report at Congress's door, the nation's
attention will be riveted on Clinton. It'll be (ital)just the
facts(end ital). People laughed at Starr when he once compared
himself to Sgt. Joe Friday, but it turns out he was right, he did
have something in common with the ``Dragnet'' cop.
 &HT;    In making the decision on what should be done with Bill Clinton
_ drop the matter? censure? impeachment? _ some in Congress will
choose along partisan lines, a few will look into their own
personal lives, but most will stick their fingers into the wind and
check the public-opinion polls. The citizenry will decide. Starr
has forced Americans to confront every last prurient fact, right
down to the presidential DNA.
 &HT;    There are those who will say that half the marriages in America
end in divorce, that if every spouse who lied about sex had to
confess on TV, the testimony would fill 500 cable channels for 500
years, that this is a matter between the Clintons and that what
Bill Clinton has already publicly admitted to is more than we would
ask of any other human being.
 &HT;    And there are those who will say it is shameful for a president
with Clinton's history to be arrogant enough to carry on a sexual
affair with a 21-year-old right in the White House, lie about it
and then take advantage of his good friends and aides by using them
to clean up his mess and cover his tracks.
 &HT;    Both conclusions are right, of course, and thanks to Starr,
during this era of relative peace and prosperity, some very painful
divisions will fracture the body politic before the matter is put
to rest.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush returned to Texas from
``nonpresidential'' campaign stops in other states last week to
propose modest tax cuts for the home folks, and Garry Mauro, his
Democratic re-election challenger, yelled, ``Gotcha!''
</P>
<P>
   No, not in the polls. Not quite.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro, still struggling to get his one campaign off the ground
while Bush is able to fly two at the same time, accused the
governor of committing a major political sin on taxes _ the
flip-flop.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, Mauro is correct. But, politically, the issue will
be debated.
</P>
<P>
   Bush now wants to repeal the state sales tax on nonprescription
drugs, diapers and most health aids, and declare a limited,
back-to-school tax holiday on inexpensive clothing for children.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Bush asked the Legislature to raise the same sales
tax by a half cent per dollar on nonprescription drugs, diapers,
health aids and all the other hundreds of goods and services that
the tax covers.
</P>
<P>
   If lawmakers enact Bush's new tax-cut proposal, the average
Texas family will save about $35 a year, depending on how many
children a family has, how often they get sick and other factors
relating to the tax.
</P>
<P>
   If legislators had enacted Bush's tax plan last year, which they
didn't, that same average family would have paid $71 a year more in
sales taxes, according to the governor's estimate.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference an election year can make.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness to Bush, however, the sales-tax increase that he
proposed last year would have been part of a trade-off for lower
school property taxes. The higher sales taxes under that more
far-reaching plan, according to the governor's estimate at the
time, would have been more than offset by an average savings of
$333 a year in property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature rejected the proposal because it also included a
controversial change in business taxes, and many lawmakers didn't
have the stomach to raise the sales tax or any other tax in a year
when state government had a budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   So legislators gave taxpayers less than half of the property-tax
relief the governor had requested _ about $140 a year _ by raising
the homestead exemption on school taxes. Lawmakers paid for it by
taking $1 billion of the budget surplus for this biennium and
giving it to school districts, which also had been part of Bush's
plan.
</P>
<P>
   With an even larger surplus forecast for the next budget period,
tax-cut fever is more prevalent than ever among political
candidates this year.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro wants to use a large chunk of the surplus, which could
grow to as much as $6 billion, to pay for a $6,000-a-year teacher
pay raise. But he also has proposed eliminating the sales tax on
motor vehicles and paying for it by doubling the ``sin'' taxes on
alcohol and tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Most Texans don't buy new cars very often, but when they do, the
several hundred dollars they would save under Mauro's proposal
would be much more noticeable than the few pennies they would save
on a bottle of pain reliever under Bush's new plan.
</P>
<P>
   It could even be argued that Mauro, the Democratic nominee, has
the Republican tax-cut plan, and Bush is promoting a Democratic
tax-cut option.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican would save a lot more tax money on a new Cadillac
or Lexus than a Democrat would on an old, beat-up Chevy. Since the
auto sales tax is 6.25 percent of the vehicle's price, the more
expensive the car, the greater the savings.
</P>
<P>
   But Mauro would argue that, that old, beat-up Chevy and whatever
taxes are saved on it may be worth their weight in gold to a
working-class Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   For most Texans, meanwhile, the $35 a year they could expect to
save under Bush's limited sales-tax cut would hardly scratch their
budget. Low-income Texans, however, would benefit the most because
they pay a higher proportion of their income in taxes than do
middle-income and wealthy people.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy reliance on the sales tax is one reason Texas has one
of the most regressive tax systems in the country. Bush didn't seem
concerned about that fact when he proposed an increase in the sales
tax last year, but, as noted earlier, this is an election year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite last year's property-tax cut, which Bush calls the
largest (collectively) in Texas history, the governor may fear he
still needs to strengthen his tax-cut record for his anticipated
White House race.
</P>
<P>
   He is on record during the 1997 session as proposing a new
business tax and a general sales-tax increase, something other
presidential contenders may try to make an issue.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, another likely contender for the GOP presidential
nomination in 2000, already has called Bush the ``tax man in
Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes also has challenged Bush and other governors to outlaw
taxes on Internet services. And guess what? Bush's new tax-relief
plan also proposes a sales-tax exemption for Internet access.

PUBLIC EYE: MAKING SENSE OF SPRAWL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  (lb) 
 By BARBARA FLANAGAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I love sprawl!'' claimed Susan Nigra Snyder, a Philadelphia
architect having lunch with a klatch of design academics at the
University of Pennsylvania. Defiant, she paused for the horrified
reaction she's come to expect. Indeed, the eating stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing an architect swoon over suburban sprawl is the same as
watching a chef pour Cheeze Whiz over a plate of quenelles.
Creative, you think, but alarmingly tacky. But what Ms. Snyder
really deplores is all the deploring. For decades, her fellow
designers have been so busy hating America's goofy suburban image,
judging it by its aesthetic form, that they have not dared to
venture forth and figure it out.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Snyder, the chairwoman of the advisory board of design for
the Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority, also teaches a graduate
course at Penn called ``Mapping the Nontraditional City,'' looking
at how the city is formed by the forces of consumption.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a camera, and often flanked by her students, Ms.
Snyder drives, shops and surreptitiously shoots her way around the
nation's ugliest ``consumption sites,'' as she calls them: malls,
outlets, warehouse clubs, Niketowns, zones where retail blurs with
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing that I had never shopped at a warehouse supermart,
Ms. Snyder agreed to tour through Sam's Club as if it were a souk
in Istanbul, and show off sprawl's redeeming value. The destination
was a new mall with a sketchy address _ no more than the
intersection of two highways, 33 and 248 _ plopped in the
cornfields of mideastern Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Called a ``power center,'' this kind of mall, Ms. Snyder
explained, is made up of big discount stores side by side, making
one enormous facade served by a skinny sidewalk. Power centers
allow consumers to drive right up to the store they want, rush in
and grab discounted wares. Beautiful it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   From the highway, we turned into the vast lot where the usual
streetscape of driving aids _ stop signs, intersections, curbs,
street signs _ was missing. With no streets, how's a person to know
where to drive?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can sketch it for you in a second,''` Ms. Snyder offered.
``Here's the access road,'' she said. ``It's like a doughnut. You
drive around the edge, park in the middle, and there are direct
doors into the stores.'' &UR;  &LR; Simple. ``Just because it's not a city
grid doesn't mean it's orderless. It's just an order you can't read
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, we paused to inhale the spaciousness. Although it
smelled of new tires, there was something strangely uplifting about
the place. Using the same tricks as the Roman Pantheon _ tall
ceilings, bright skylighting and spacious floors _ the building
made the rumpled shoppers, dwarfed by the civic dimensions, look
strangely dignified.
</P>
<P>
   The merchandise, too, was monumental. An aluminum
trampoline-in-a-domed-tent loomed impressively; at $370, it was as
big as a house. In comparison, the turbine-size industrial fans,
reminiscent of those in Fritz Lang's ``Metropolis,'' appeared just
quaint enough to buy on impulse.
</P>
<P>
   Acoustically, of course, Sam's Club was chaos. Loudspeakers
interrupted Muzak with commands, while choruses of new televisions
blared commercials. The sound boosted the visual cacophony of the
merchandise. Stationed between air compressors and Popsicles, a
dour woman offered hot samples: ``Have a Jimmy Dean's frozen
mini-cheeseburger?'' We demurred; she scowled.
</P>
<P>
   I shot Ms. Snyder an imploring look: Does modern life really
have to be so unappetizing? The architect explained how
transportation outranks aesthetics in this kind of environment.
``Every time they &UR;  &LR; touch the merchandise, it costs money,'' she
said. ``So, ideally, they put it on a pallet, drive it to the
shelf, peel off shrink wrap and it's ready for sale.'' Store
workers don't style the merchandise; they park it where it fits.
</P>
<P>
   Order? Ms. Snyder waved at the low piles of material massed in
the center of this huge room like the camping grounds of a civil
defense shelter. ``The middle is seasonal goods, the high steel
shelving at the sides is for things that are constant,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But where was the aisle signage? Why the paucity of colorful
promotions? ``Customers are bombarded with advertising all the
time,'' Ms. Snyder said. With the floor plan memorized and
television jingles looping through the brain, each regular customer
arrives with all the information he or she needs.
</P>
<P>
   En route to the parking lot, I asked Ms. Snyder if she could
imagine helping the mall phenomenon rise to a higher plane of
civility. ``I'm not into the better breadbox routine with these
things,'' she answered, citing the sorry example of a Cape Cod
Wal-Mart pressured to pretty its facade in New England style. Ms.
Snyder wants to look at the values underlying the buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The students I'm seeing at Penn are not growing up in
traditional small cities and towns,'' the architect explained. They
are suburban kids of suburban parents. ``When they come to the
university, the prevailing paradigm that exists in academia is that
the spatial form in which they've grown up is morally bankrupt,''
she said. ``What I do is try to make sense of today's life. But
first you have ask the questions.''
</P>
<P>
   As we drove from the power center, Ms. Snyder did a double take
at a gas station where gangs of fuel pumps stood under two
canopies. It was an unmanned service station of drive-up cash
machines. Neither of us had to spell out the irony. Yesterday the
local bank was a Greek temple on the town square; today it's a
filling station at a distant, exurban power center waiting to
subsume the surrounding towns.
</P>
<P>
   At the traffic light, the next question was mine: How do we get
out of here?

PARIS: CITY OF LITE APARTMENT PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TRACIE ROZHON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bored to tears by endless cocktail-party speculation about
whether the gyrating stock market will tarnish the value of $10
million Park Avenue apartments? Take that ennui right over to the
Champs-Elysees and buy the same-size prewar palace for a (relative)
chanson _ significantly less than it would cost in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, there will probably be a few things missing: a doorman, for
one. The French don't have co-ops, so apartments are easier for
Americans to buy. Maybe there will be one or two fewer bathrooms.
There may also be (catastrophe!) fewer maids' rooms.
</P>
<P>
   But you will be buying, generally speaking, more wrought iron,
more portes-fenetres (we call them french doors), more courtyards _
and more eccentric layouts.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report to be released later this month, the
French real estate market is just coming out of an eight-year
recession and prices are still low. Lawrence Sicular, the report's
author and the chief appraiser for the New York real estate firm of
Brown Harris Stevens, stayed with friends in Paris in June and
compared the two cities' luxe markets _ creme de la creme vs. creme
de la creme. An avowed Francophile, Sicular lived in Paris in the
mid-1970s and is still intrigued by the city and its architecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``After doing market reports for two years on Manhattan alone, I
decided to branch out,'' he said. ``Having a Paris apartment is a
dream for many Americans. It turned out this may be the time to
buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Brown Harris Stevens is affiliated with Christie's
Great Estates, which in turn is affiliated with real estate
brokerages all over the world, Sicular said that his report was not
intended to promote any particular Paris apartments _ or even
buying Paris apartments in general.
</P>
<P>
   But many Americans aren't waiting for the report _ or the
advice. Marie-Helene Lundgreen, an agent with Feau Group, a
high-end real estate firm in Paris, sad that the number of American
buyers has increased in the last 18 months _ from about 10 percent
of the firm's clients to between 30 and 35 percent _ because of the
perception that Paris is cheap. More than half of her own clients
are American, she added, and most of them are from New York,
Chicago and Beverly Hills, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Americans are looking for a pied-a-terre, but Ms.
Lundgreen cautioned that her pieds-a-terre are not holes in the
wall: almost all of the desirable ones are asking more than
$500,000. But she agreed with Sicular that at the high end, they
were cheaper than in New York. ``It is very rare that people spend
$2 million here,'' she said in an interview from her Paris office,
noting that New Yorkers were ``a little bit astonished not to see a
doorman.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider this example: In Paris, a seven-room spread on the
Place d'Iena, one of the city's most prestigious locations, is for
sale for $1.75 million, with $833 monthly carrying charges.
Practically untouched since the 30's, the place has an eat-in
kitchen and three fantasy tiled bathrooms. The apartment needs some
work, Sicular writes in the report, but it ``looks over an old
mansion to superb views of the Eiffel Tower, the Pantheon, the
Invalides and the Seine.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaching the apartment is half the fun. Along Fifth Avenue,
apartment buildings sit smack on the street, flaunting their
facades. In Paris, apartments like this one are hidden away: you
walk through a carriageway into a courtyard, duck under a glass
canopy and step into an elaborate scrolled-iron cage elevator,
which _ at last _ delivers you onto your own private floor. Inside
the front door, the apartment has a paneled salon with plaster
moldings, a Louis XV marble mantle, a round Art Deco library, a
dining room, three bedrooms, three working fireplaces and three
balconies. Upstairs are a maid's room and a bath.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan, such an apartment (without the courtyard and the
old-fashioned elevator) in a comparable location and with
comparable views _ overlooking Central Park, say _ would now be
priced at closer to $3 million, Sicular said, adding that not only
would the price be higher but so would the monthly charges. The
average monthly charges for a seven-room apartment on Fifth Avenue
in the 70s are more than $3,000, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, rich Americans often head for the Avenue Foch, which
ends at the Arc de Triomphe. ``Indeed, most of Paris' very few
doorman buildings are located here,'' Sicular writes. But the
French aren't as crazy for Avenue Foch. ``It is considered too
foreign, too quiet and too attractive to the occasional high-level
prostitute,'' he said. Nevertheless, the grandest apartments are
there.
</P>
<P>
   But what about Paris apartments for your average American
(accepting the premise that your average American might be buying a
spare home away from home in the City of Light).
</P>
<P>
   The averages tell all. In Paris, the average price of an
apartment in 1997 was $149,433, according to the French Association
of Notaries. In Manhattan, below 96th Street, the average co-op
price was $424,365 in 1997, said Miller Samuel, a citywide
appraisal company.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lundgreen doesn't usually handle apartments selling for less
than $500,000, but she recalls a one-bedroom near the Place de la
Madeleine, complete with air-conditioning (not a given in Paris),
marble baths and a granite kitchen. The apartment, owned by an
American from California, sold for $230,000 _ to another American
from California.
</P>
<P>
   Sicular saw it. Although he doesn't report on Paris apartments
selling for anywhere near $200,000, he has familiarity with them.
``It's my dream,'' he confessed. ``I spent part of that month
looking for a place of my own!''
</P>
<P>
   Copies of the Brown Harris Stevens report are available at no
charge by calling (212) 508-7275 after Sept. 15.

 &HT;    BOOK SAYS TOP GIVERS GET MORE THAN ORDINARY PEOPLE FROM CONGRESS
 &HT;    600&AMP;add. With INTEGRITY-DATA.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ordinary citizens suffer because congressional
leaders routinely make legislative moves favored by their biggest
contributors, says a book released Wednesday by the Center for
Public Integrity.
</P>
<P>
   The book, titled ``The Buying of the Congress,'' say the results
include a shift of the tax burden from corporations to middle-class
taxpayers, a lack of affordable health insurance for millions of
Americans, threats against wetland-protection and open-space laws,
and lack of progress in tightening child labor and child welfare
laws.
</P>
<P>
   The nonpartisan, nonprofit research center's report is available
on the Internet (http://www.publicintegrity.org).
</P>
<P>
   Among the hundreds of examples compiled by the center's founder,
Charles Lewis, with the help of three dozen reporters and
researchers were:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., fought successfully on
behalf of the boat-building industry's drive to eliminate the 10
percent luxury tax on sales of yachts worth $100,000 or more. His
biggest giver between 1987 and 1996, Wisconsin yachtsman and
boat-builder Terry Kohler and his wife, Mary, gave Gingrich
$816,107.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., helped convince
President Clinton to drop his proposal to use higher taxes on
alcoholic drinks to pay for health care reforms. In the 10-year
period, donors from the Anheuser-Busch beer-brewing companies gave
Gephardt $215,300.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., fought to weaken
environmental laws that cramped suburban and rural developers,
while accepting $367,498 from the National Realtors Association.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., who cosponsored
legislation that would require the federal government to pay for
hospice care for terminally ill veterans, also took $23,000 in
those 10 years from executives of Miami-based Healthcare Corp.,
which derives 85 percent of its revenue from the federal Medicare
program.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Corporate income taxes, which supplied 28 percent of federal
revenues in 1956, today account for only 10 percent. Between 1987
and 1996, executives of the nation's 500 largest corporations _
ranging on the latest list from General Motors Corp. through
500th-ranked Vencor Inc. _ gave members of Congress $182 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guess who had to pick up the slack?'' Lewis said. ``When you
keep making deals like this, you're going to start shafting the
average person, and that is the message of this book.''
</P>
<P>
   Spokespersons for several leaders mentioned by Lewis said that
they were motivated by a desire to do what is best for the country,
not by a desire to please their donors.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's campaign spokesman, Mike Shields, dismissed the book
as simply the latest in a series of ``silly reports from liberally
biased 'watchdog' groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Bristling at the ``liberal'' label, Lewis retorted, ``He didn't
say a say a word about that in 1996 when we broke the story of the
Lincoln Bedroom,'' which Clinton used to entertain big Democratic
contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis denounced Gingrich's work to kill the yacht tax as
``corporate welfare'' that benefited the Kohlers.
</P>
<P>
   Shields responded that the center had it backwards. Describing
Gingrich as ``the visionary leader of the conservative movement in
the Republican Party,'' Shields said, ``People buy into the
speaker's ideas, not the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis replied: ``I don't know who asked who first, and frankly,
I don't care. The fact is, things are done for the patrons and
things are done for the politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows)
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Lewis said, his book lists top leaders' ``most
important career patrons, the favorite and most trusted and most
reliable and most significant sponsors of their careers.''
</P>
<P>
   The 10 most generous political contributors to 32 congressional
leaders in the 10-year period that ended Dec. 31, 1996, are listed.
The tally included gifts to or spending for each leader's campaign
and his leadership committee, but not to his party or to the
``non-partisan'' foundations or nonprofit groups that some leaders
maintain.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's top 10 ``career patrons'' ranged from the Kohlers
down to Golden Rule Financial Corp., an Illinois-based insurance
company that gave the speaker and his ``leadership'' committees
$213,100. None were from his home state.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the leaders didn't depend on any one source for as much
as $200,000 over the 10-year period. For example, Gingrich's fellow
Georgian, Senate Republican Conference Chairman Paul Coverdell,
received $95,806 from his top patron, the National Rifle
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Others who received $200,000 or more from a single source
included Lott and Gephardt; Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., who took
$339,550 from Auto Dealers &AMP; Drivers for Free Trade; House
Democratic Caucus Chairman Vic Fazio, D-Calif., $302,085 from the
American Medical Association, and Senate Banking Chairman Alfonse
D'Amato, $262,000 from billionaire Ron O. Perelman and his firm.
</P>
<P>
   Many details in the book are taken from previously published
news stories. Ellen Miller, founder of Public Campaign, a
nonpartisan advocacy group, said the new 416-page tome is ``the
most comprehensive overview of federal campaign finances that I
have ever seen.''

BUSINESS TRAVEL: AMERICAN EXPRESS CHECKS TO BE ISSUED IN EUROS

   American Express said Tuesday that it would print
euro-denominated traveler's checks in time for sales to start on
Jan. 1, 1999, the beginning of the European Monetary Union. While
the euro becomes the official currency of the 11-nation euro-zone
Jan. 1, with national currency exchange rates fixed to the euro,
the circulation of euro notes and coins will not begin until Jan.

   During the three-year transition, consumers will be able to use
the American Express euro traveler's checks _ in denominations of
50, 100 and 200 euro _ to pay for goods and services while
merchants begin to convert to euro pricing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect the euro-denominated traveler's checks to be
accepted by local merchants as soon as they begin pricing their
products in euros,'' said Victoria Handwerk, an American Express
spokeswoman. ``But during the transition, American Express
traveler's checks, as always, can be cashed for local currency if
desired at our travel service offices within the euro-zone.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said the euro traveler's checks would enable purchasers
to travel anywhere in the euro-zone without having to worry about
multiple currencies. The euro-zone countries are Germany, France,
Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Austria, Spain,
Portugal, Ireland and Finland.
</P>
<P>
   The new traveler's checks will have a pastel-colored world map
on the front and acceptance instructions in English, French and
German on the back. They will include security features like those
on dollar-denominated checks.
</P>
<P>
   The euro-denominated checks will be available worldwide
beginning Jan. 1, 1999, at American Express travel service offices,
at some financial institutions, exchange bureaus and travel
agencies, including the American and Canadian Automobile
Associations. In the United States, American Express card holders
will be able to order the euro checks by telephone (800 221-7282)
for delivery by mail after the new year.
</P>
<P>
   During the transition, American Express traveler's checks will
also be available in local currencies, and will be valid
indefinitely. But national currencies and national-currency
traveler's checks will not be sold after June 30, 2002, when the
euro will become the only legal currency used in the participating
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Coping With the Strike
</P>
<P>
   While the strike against Northwest Airlines continues to
inconvenience travelers in the Midwest, business travelers appear
to be taking it more or less in stride.
</P>
<P>
   A survey conducted last Wednesday through Friday among corporate
travel managers by the National Business Travel Association found
that 63 percent of those surveyed had been affected by the strike,
but that more than 77 percent had rebooked on other major carriers
in anticipation of the strike.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, 22 percent of corporate travel managers surveyed said
that during the strike they had turned to low-fare carriers, niche
carriers or new-entrant carriers. And of those, more than 65
percent said they would consider moving the rebooked travel
permanently to alternate carriers.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, 57 percent of the travel managers do not want
President Clinton to intervene formally in the strike.
</P>
<P>
   No-Paper Ticketing Abroad
</P>
<P>
   Over the next three months United Airlines plans to extend its
electronic ticketing service to Singapore; three cities in China
(Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong); Belgium; France; Germany; Italy,
and the Netherlands. The addition of those 7 nations will bring to
12 the number of foreign countries using United e-mail. Australia,
Canada, Japan and New Zealand were added this year, while Britain
was put on line last October.
</P>
<P>
   United said that the use of its E-tickets, which allow
passengers to board planes without paper tickets, reached an
all-time industry high of 3.4 million last month. During that
month, 56 percent of eligible itineraries were ticketed
electronically, an increase of almost 11 percent over August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines are reluctant to disclose the exact amount of money
they save with E-tickets compared with paper tickets, because
estimated savings per E-ticket range all over the tarmac. But it is
generally believed that the major airlines save about $10 million a
month each, which of course explains their eagerness to expand
electronic ticketing as far and as fast as possible.

TOURISM THRIVES, BUT PORTFOLIO JITTERS COULD QUIET THE BOOM
</HEADLINE>

Nev., Hawaii, Calif.)   (Repeating: also moved in `f' category)

<TEXT>
<P>
   The summer travel season ended Monday with expectations that it
had set another record and with forecasts of record tourism again
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit Travel Industry Association of America had
estimated that Americans would take 251 million trips this summer,
3 percent more than last year, and it has predicted a record 196
million travelers this fall, a 5 percent increase over last fall.
</P>
<P>
   But while the association's forecasts have generally been close,
since they take travel intentions as their measure of the
likelihood of travel, those intentions are unusually iffy now,
given the unpredictability of the economy, the unreliability of the
weather and the fickleness of would-be travelers.
</P>
<P>
   So projections for fall travel may be shaken by the same
uncertainty that bedeviled this summer's travel plans. Who, for
example, could have foreseen the Northwest Airlines strike, which
has affected about 150,000 passengers a day, including many
would-be tourists, since it began two weeks ago? Or who could have
predicted the recent stock market slide?
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street selloff could play a big role in fall travel.
Tourism in the autumn depends heavily on retirees and other older
people who prefer to travel then, when there are fewer crowds and
lower prices than in the summer, but who also pay particularly
close attention to swings in the market.
</P>
<P>
   While the Travel Industry Association has found a steady
increase over four years in the number of people who say they
intend to take children with them on vacation in the fall (40
percent this year), it has also found that travelers planning to
take the longest trips this fall will be ages 65 or older (15
nights average) and retired (14 nights).
</P>
<P>
   While 41 percent of respondents to the poll said they expected
to spend less than $500 each on fall pleasure trips, people on
their longest trips of the season planned to spend an average of
$871. But those averages appear likely to dwindle if travelers'
stock portfolios continue to decline.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, many cities and states had either a record or a robust
summer season, the result of a strong economy, low gasoline prices
and generally favorable weather.
</P>
<P>
   Cape Cod, for example, had a ``great summer,'' according to the
Falmouth Chamber of Commerce, helped by an influx of European
visitors. The $51 million in July room rental revenues in Ocean
City, Md., topped last year's July revenues by almost 10 percent
and exceeded the previous July record of $48 million, set in 1995.
Unseasonably warm weather beginning in April is expected to lead
Michigan to report a record number of summer visitors, while
similar good weather helped fill Minnesota's hotels, resorts and
campgrounds, and, tourism officials say, is likely to continue well
into the fall. Visitors to Connecticut this summer helped that
state take in $2.3 million more in hotel taxes than it collected
last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Carolinas also attracted plenty of tourists this summer, at
least until Hurricane Bonnie forced the evacuation of visitors
along with residents late last month. An estimated 120,000 of the
200,000 people ordered to leave the coastal areas of Horry and
Georgetown counties in South Carolina were tourists, according to
Gov. David Beasley. North Carolina officials estimated that the
hurricane inflicted more than $1 billion in damage along the coast
and cost the state millions more in lost tourism revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hurricane Earl pounded Florida's Gulf Coast last week,
doing substantial damage, it departed before the crucial Labor Day
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Texas tourism, second in size only to that of California, had to
cope with sweltering heat in the Dallas area last month as well as
forest fires in Mexico earlier this summer that created smog
conditions and led to a statewide health alert.
</P>
<P>
   Like the smoke from Mexico's fires, the effects of Asia's
economic crisis were felt inside U.S. borders. Hardest hit was
Hawaii, which managed to attract 26,670 more visitors from the U.S.
mainland during June and July than it did in those months last
year, but lost 51,540 visitors from Asia (mostly Japan) over the
same months of comparison. August figures are not expected to show
any improvement.
</P>
<P>
   California also felt the effects of the Asian downturn, as did
even Las Vegas, Nev. _ although after it doubled its advertising
budget for the summer, to $5 million, the number of visitors in May
rose 1.3 percent over those last May, while June's visitor figures
rose 1.1 percent over those of the previous June. Preliminary
figures for July, which have not yet been compiled, indicate a
further gain over 1997, which itself saw a record 30.5 million
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were pretty modest increases,'' acknowledged Rob Powers,
public relations director for the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors
Authority, ``but they marked a turnaround from the first quarter of
this year, when visitation was down a couple of percentage
points.'' His tone made it clear that in a city with 106,000 hotel
beds to fill each night, soon to rise to 126,000, even modest
increases are welcome.

<P>
   If you are like most Americans, your medicine cabinet is packed
with a pricey assortment of pills and potions, evidence that we, as
a country, like to feel good. And some of the newer pills _ say,
Viagra and Prozac _ can make even others feel good about you.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are the largest consumers of prescription drugs in the
world, spending some $94 billion for them last year, according to
IMS Health, a health care consulting company.
</P>
<P>
   This year's tally should be ever higher, thanks especially to
Viagra, a treatment for impotency, which is expected to rack up a
record $1 billion in sales in its first year on the market.
Stockholders in the world's pharmaceutical companies have come to
expect blockbuster sales, so the companies have been forced to
churn out blockbuster remedies faster than before.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Merck &AMP; Co., the nation's largest pharmaceutical
company, released five new drugs that treat everything from
migraines to asthma.
</P>
<P>
   And there are plenty more on the way. Within a year, Lipha
Pharmaceuticals, a German subsidiary of Merck, expects to release
Campral, a drug to help alcoholics wean themselves from drinking,
in the United States. For people who cannot knock off at night,
American Home Products will soon roll out Sonata, a sleeping pill
that the company says has fewer groggy after-effects than some of
its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to get buried in the drug avalanche, unable to
distinguish the side effects of antihistamines like Claritin and
Allegra. If the unthinkable happens and you become impotent, what
are Viagra's advantages over Caverject? It makes a difference _ one
is a pill and one is a shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the last several years, the entire process of
pharmaceutical research has sped up,'' said Dr. Jeffrey Adelglass,
a Dallas physician. ``With some of the pharmaceutical sites now
available on the Web, I can get medical information as fast or
faster than anyone else in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Several sites can help you find out how a drug should be taken,
while others blow the whistle on the inaccuracy of some of the drug
makers' advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration, which regulates the sales and
advertising of prescription drugs in this country, seldom requires
a company to correct an error in its marketing. But it does have a
site with information on drugs' safety records and government
reprimand letters about advertising campaigns
(www.fda.gov/cder/drug.htm).
</P>
<P>
   For those interested in what prescription drugs are under
development, sites like www.centerwatch.com list clinical trials
for pharmaceuticals and medical treatments being developed.
</P>
<P>
   There are other online drug information resources, like the
National Library of Medicine, which has put Medline, its extensive
database of medical information on the Web at www.nlm.nih.gov.
Merck &AMP; Co., publisher of the drug encyclopedia called The Merck
Index, has put The Merck Index of Diagnosis and Therapy on its
corporate home page (www.merck.com).
</P>
<P>
   The Merck Manual is a more general source of medical information
than the Index (which is sold on CD-ROM). It is used extensively by
doctors and nurses nationwide. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WWW.RXLIST.COM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When doctors are stumped about a drug's possible side effects,
they usually consult the Physician's Desk Reference, the
pharmaceutical bible of the medical community. Yet plenty of MDs
also appear to be this site, a thorough index of many drugs on the
market and under development.
</P>
<P>
   Created by Neil Sandow, a pharmacist in the San Francisco Bay
area, RxList provides an exhaustive look at 500 prescription drugs,
roughly 90 percent of what is available in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Say you've just been prescribed Klonopin and have no clue about
the side effects. Just type the drug name into the search field and
wait for a mountain of information, easily searched by subheads.
Klonopin, for example, is the brand name for an anticonvulsant
called clonazepam. One of its common side effects: depression.
</P>
<P>
   The most attractive feature about RxList is the depth of its
information. With each drug comes a list of ingredients also found
in the pill. (Each time you swallow a Klonopin, you'll get a little
lactose and cornstarch, too.)
</P>
<P>
   RxList also says which insurers carry the drug on their
formularies. If you are prescribed Klonopin, you're in luck if
you're covered by Aetna, Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Medi-Cal or
PCS.
</P>
<P>
   Few pharmaceutical Web sites are as popular as this one. Some
15,000 to 20,000 people visit RxList everyday. As a testament to
the site's thoroughness, most visitors appear to be health care
professionals. In a continous online survey of 48,566 RxList users,
49 percent of them were doctors or nurses, while 22.4 percent were
pharmacists.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of doctors use us when they get a new prescription and
they can't find the drug in the PDR,'' said Ed Schlenker, a partner
at RxList. ``One thing we hear from our users is that they want to
see more stuff on the site. And we're working on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though RxList is a good source for drug information, the
site's owners caution that it should be used only as a supplement
and that it is not all-inclusive. Viagra was included in RxList,
while Detrol, another hot new drug _ this one for incontinence _
was nowhere to be found. ( Schlenker said it would be added soon.)
</P>
<P>
   You may also have to search under variations of a drug's name to
get the correct information: Not just lithium, for example, but the
drug's full name _ lithium carbonate. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WWW.FDA.GOV/CDER/DRUG.HTM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition to finding information on a medication's proper use,
consumers may also want to examine a drug's safety record,
particularly given the spate of recent disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, the diet drug combination fen-phen was voluntarily
pulled off the market by its maker, American Home Products, after
reports that it caused heart damage in some patients. In June,
American Home Products pulled Duract, a painkiller, over fears that
it had caused liver failure in four patients.
</P>
<P>
   Those who want to examine a drug's safety record or check out
the ethics of a drug company's latest advertising campaign, can now
do both at this site, owned by the Center for Drug Evaluation and
Research (a division of the Food and Drug Administration). It
throws a spotlight on the pharmaceutical industry's latest sinners.
And they appear to be numerous.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) &QL; 
 &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research site
is clear and easy to navigate. You can call up a quick list of
drugs, both patented and generic, that have been recently approved
by the FDA. Some of them are so new, they may not even be available
in drug stores. Yet the site has something for nearly everyone.
</P>
<P>
   People who had taken Duract could call up a news release that
provided detailed information on how to tell if they had been
adversely affected and what medical help they should seek.
</P>
<P>
   While these topics are helpful, what really stands out here is
the FDA's list of reprimand letters, which are neatly organized by
product, company and issue date. (If you set out to find the same
reprimands on the FDA home page, you will come up empty-handed
after clicking the mouse for 20 minutes.)
</P>
<P>
   Viewing the letters on the Center for Drug Evaluation's Web site
does require Adobe Acrobat software, which can be downloaded right
there, but the tune-up may be worth the effort. You will discover
that even pharmaceutical companies with good overall reputations
are occasionally up to no good.
</P>
<P>
   Merck was recently rapped on its knuckles for running an
advertisement in Time magazine for Propecia, its hair growth pill,
that lacked any information about the risks, a government
requirement. For its part, Merck said that it did not think the ad
needed any disclaimer but that it had immediately obeyed the FDA's
suggestion nonetheless. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WWW.CENTERWATCH.COM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the desperately ill, new drugs can never come out quickly
enough. The Centerwatch site can tell such people where new drugs
are being tested. The site lists more than 7,000 clinical trials
for drugs and other medical treatments. Nearly all of them are
recruiting patients at test centers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The site, owned by Centerwatch, a Boston publishing company,
began three years ago and has quickly become a medical and an
online sensation. Each month, the Centerwatch site receives 100,000
visits from 85,000 patients or their advocates. And the site still
has room to grow: 7,000 clinical trials is roughly about 10 percent
of the nation's total.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web site is not a big profit maker for us,'' said Ken
Getz, a principal and publisher of Centerwatch. ``But it addresses
a critical need for patients who are eager for alternative
treatments.''
</P>
<P>
   Navigating through the site's bounty of clinical trials is a
breeze. The trials are organized into 20 broad disease categories,
which include everything from oncology to dental/maxielofacial
surgery. Within each grouping are specific ailments, with the
trials for each disease organized by states.
</P>
<P>
   People searching for a specific clinical trial should find it
quickly here, especially if they suffer from a common ailment. On a
recent day, there were 423 clinical trials under way for
hypertension, 73 for HIV, and 69 for rheumatoid arthritis. Many of
the trials provide an e-mail response box for speedy enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   Okay. You're not sick, just short on your rent money.
Centerwatch may still be for you. Many of the trials pay stipends
and some of the medical procedures are noninvasive. For example,
researchers at Hill Top Research Inc. in Birmingham, Ala., are
paying up to $250 for women volunteers for an acne study. If you do
not qualify, there are 21 other clinical trials for acne that are
recruiting patients.
</P>
<P>
   The listings on this site are exhaustive. There are even
clinical trials for children. Boys and girls 12 years old or older
can earn $160 by taking an investigational medication for strep
throat at the Allergy and Asthma Research Institute in Louisville,
Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Centerwatch has become a crucial tool for some patients to come
to terms with their illnesses. Women who have had mastectomies can
take a drug at the Pain Trials Center in Boston as part of a study
to manage pain from that surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason our site has become popular, I think, is because
people are less trusting of medical opinion,'' said Getz. ``They
are taking more responsibility for their health education.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WWW.IMS-HEALTH.COM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the most comprehensive sites for information on
the pharmaceutical industry. The AC Nielsen Corp. of the
pharmaceutical industry, IMS Health regularly tallies sales of all
prescription drugs in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts and drug companies executives regularly use
the site for sales information, but there appears to be plenty of
helpful material for other interested observers as well _ hard as
it might be to find it.
</P>
<P>
   The site is particularly useful in identifying the most popular
drug for almost any condition. It also has information on treatment
trends for certain conditions, including HIV and high cholesterol
levels, and on the factors that influence a doctor in prescribing
certain medications.
</P>
<P>
   But searching through IMS is akin to strolling through a large
pharmacy with confusing aisle signs. The site map is intimidating.
For example, the section called Over the Counter, which has news
tidbits on nonprescription drugs like Tylenol, includes 29 other
icons, including Strategic Technologies and Erisco, which is IMS's
information systems subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   If you are looking for prescription drug sales, logic suggests
clicking on Product News. But that quickly becomes an adventure in
frustration. Type the word Prozac, Eli Lilly's ubiquitous
antidepressant, into the search field and you will get zero
responses.
</P>
<P>
   That is especially odd, given that Prozac was the second
best-selling drug in the United States last year.
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe this site was not designed for a computer neophyte. I
tried again, typing Glaxo, short for Glaxo Wellcome, into the
search field under the category Company News. Again, a complete
bust. That was even more annoying. Glaxo Wellcome is the
second-largest pharmaceutical company on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   An IMS executive explained that the company's main site was
being tuned up. The information about prescription drugs was hidden
in the site map in a section called IMS America. But after moving
there, then clicking on Pharmaceutical Division and News or Trends,
I was able to find the best-selling drug in the United States last
year: Prilosec, Astra-Merck's anti-ulcer medication, with sales of
$2.28 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's top drug seller: Merck? Nope. Try Bristol-Myers
Squibb, with sales of $5.69 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The IMS site is updated weekly, with news items added as they
occur.

 &HT;    U.S. CIGARETTE LABELS IN OTHER LANDS CALLED INADEQUATE
 &HT;    By NICHOLE MONROE
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Labels on U.S.-manufactured cigarettes do not
adequately warn consumers in foreign countries of the health risks
involved with smoking, consumer advocates charged Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A study issued by Public Citizen's Health Research Group showed
that labels on cigarettes sold in Africa, Asia, South America and
Eastern Europe give consumers less warning about the risks of
smoking than labels in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that in general gave no more warning than
is required by the laws of countries where they are sold. No
tobacco companies were found to be out of compliance with a
country's labeling laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``American cigarette companies are practicing a lethal double
standard,'' said Peter Lurie, an author of the study.
``Non-Americans are being denied vital information available to
U.S. residents.''
</P>
<P>
   Cigarettes sold in the United States must carry label warnings
that cigarette smoke contains carbon monoxide and that smoking can
cause cancer, heart and lung disease and should be avoided by
pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Research Group study gives support to legislators
like Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, at a time when he and others are
pushing legislation that would require cigarette packages and
advertisements in foreign markets to carry the same health warnings
as are required in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, introduced in April, also would prohibit U.S.
embassy staff members and trade representatives from helping to
promote the sale of U.S. tobacco products abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Doggett and other Democratic lawmakers have expressed concern
that tobacco companies may increase foreign sales to help pay for
court settlements such as the one in Texas and defray the costs of
any comprehensive tobacco legislation that Congress might pass this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Doggett said it is imperative that the United States step in and
develop a comprehensive plan to curb smoking worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The study used GLOBALink, an Internet listserv of anti-tobacco
activists to examine warning label requirements in 45 countries.
The most common warning was of heart disease and the least common
was that smoking can be addictive. Warning requirements vary widely
from country to country.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Canada and Finland require detailed warnings by
law, and Romania and Vietnam require only rudimentary cautions.
</P>
<P>
   Authors said a Marlboro pack received from Japan displays the
warning required by the Japanese government: ``Be careful not to
smoke too much, because it is harmful to your health.''

   COLORADO -- Colorado motorists could save an average of $230 a
year in insurance premiums -- tallying an estimated $639 million in
savings statewide -- under a bipartisan insurance bill. The bill
would allow consumers to choose between existing insurance as
regulated by their state or the new national plan that would limit
liability claims to actual damage and include no payment for things
like ``pain and suffering.'' Denver Mayor Wellington Webb came to
Washington to pitch the plan. Zaret

   CONNECTICUT -- SIERRA. It certainly sounded like a campaign ad.
Pronouncing that the ``Connecticut (River)'s future just got
brighter... because Congresswoman Nancy Johnson helped get it named
an American Heritage River...,'' the radio ad touted the New
Britain Republican's efforts for the environment. But the Sierra
Club, the group that sponsored the advertisement, insists it was
merely intended to ensure Johnson continues to vote for clean water
and other environmental causes. (Working). Maggi

   GEORGIA -- FLAG. A new poll shows that Americans overwhelmingly
support a proposed constitutional amendment to protect the U.S.
flag cosponsored by all four Augusta-Aiken area U.S. senators.

-- Strom Thurmond and Paul Coverdell -- are among congressional
leaders slammed in a new book on the influence of special interests
in Congress. (Working) Williams
</P>
<P>
   LOUISIANA -- BREAUX. Sen. John Breaux is one of the biggest
beneficiaries of money from trial lawyers, and has reacted
favorably to issues that these donors care about, such as tort
reform. Trial lawyers are benefiting from tobacco litigation at the
state level and are increasingly supportive of politicians who back
it. Stricherz

</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s television had not been invented and radios were
scarce because so many people were poor. Movie theaters were
available, but again, many were unable to pay the 25-cent price of
admission.
</P>
<P>
   People entertained themselves most of the time by singing songs,
telling stories and playing games. Occasionally, a circus or
carnival would come to town, and the people who had a bit of money
to spare would attend these activities.
</P>
<P>
   During this era, another kind of entertainment came to town two
or three times a year. It was called a ``Medicine Show'' because
the carnival owners put on a vaudeville type of entertainment --
admission free -- and made money by selling patent medicines, soap
and candy.
</P>
<P>
   Their main product was a tonic they claimed would cure any known
disease, including dropsy and the vapors, neither of which is heard
of nowadays. That was their internal medicine, composed to a great
extent of grain alcohol flavored with licorice, cinnamon or cloves.
</P>
<P>
   They also had an external medicine. It was a fiery liniment
guaranteed to cure arthritis, gout and a variety of skin
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The entertainment was not high quality, but it was free, so
medicine shows were popular. In one of the skits, an actor would
come out on the stage and search the area. A second actor would
enter and ask, ``What are you looking for?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I dropped a dime a few minutes ago,'' the first actor would
reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you drop it at the front of the stage or at the side?''
the second man asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither place. I dropped it around behind the wagon,'' the
first man replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then why don't you look for it back there?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because there ain't no lights back there,'' was the punch
line.
</P>
<P>
   We can appreciate the ridiculous humor of the comedian's logic.
Yet, we see people every day searching in the wrong places for the
things they desire.
</P>
<P>
   Too many of our fellow humans try to find peace and happiness in
drugs, alcohol and sensual excitement. And it doesn't work.
</P>
<P>
   If we desire peace, the first place to look is within ourself.
Peace isn't an external condition so much as an internal context.
</P>
<P>
   We can progress in consciousness by going on to the next larger
context of thought and realization. Becoming aware of the next
larger context of life, we may be, by the nature of our being,
impelled onward. A higher plateau of consciousness beckons.
</P>
<P>
   The desire for a deeper reality to experience the golden truth
of reality -- not the ``fool's gold'' of illusion -- whispers in
our soul that ``there is more.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, true growth requires that we unlearn some things in order
to reach the higher point of view. It may take a dose of humility
and cleansing disillusionment to prompt us to release the old
habits and ways of life that bring pain and suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Facts can have a fleeting reality of dimension, condition and
circumstances. Transitional growth experiences sometimes pose
contradictions to the past.
</P>
<P>
   The psyche can learn to reorganize and adapt itself in
preparation for entering the next larger context. This could be a
new stage in life, a new state of consciousness, or even a radical
move in our personal affairs and environment.
</P>
<P>
   It is said that Walt Whitman, who many felt had a cosmic
appreciation of life, was criticized for changing his mind and
sharply replied, ``Do I contradict myself? Very well, then, I
contradict myself!''
</P>
<P>
   The American philosopher Charles Fillmore made it clear on a
number of occasions that he reserved the right to change his mind.
If a student quoted to him something he had written some years
earlier, he was likely to ask that person, ``But what do you
think?''
</P>
<P>
   Then he would explain that he did not wish to be bound to what
he had understood or expressed in the past, affirming that he was
continually in a stage of spiritual unfoldment.
</P>
<P>
   And so are we! To find the pure gold of truth often means
getting a more universal viewpoint of life, of yourself, and of
everything that comprises your world. The greatness and power of
many souls of the past resulted in their seeing in a higher context
than perhaps the average person. They knew where to look to find
the golden nuggets of truth.
</P>
<P>
   Time does not prevent us from knowing these higher truths; our
stage of consciousness makes the difference. Each day, as we look a
little farther in our quest for truth, explore a little deeper in
the great wisdoms that abound, and search for the golden threads of
light and love, we can be led in the path of righteousness.
</P>
<P>
   Those in search of an easier, softer way to obtain the important
things of life often find cheap imitations or nothing at all. The
miner who searches for gold on the beach because the digging is
easy may certainly find lots of sand, but it's unlikely he will
find gold.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes we must dig among stones and hard clay to find the
treasure we seek. And when we do, we may learn our efforts have not
been wasted.

PLUMMER PORTRAYS THE GREAT `BARRYMORE'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; The voice purrs across the phone line like a
Mercedes-Benz engine: ``Yes, this is Christopher Plummer, how are
you?''
</P>
<P>
   Then comes a friendly chuckle, as if there were something mildly
ridiculous about this whole business of celebrity _ at least at
this ungodly hour of 11 o'clock in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   It's not surprising that Plummer, now in the autumn of a highly
accomplished stage, film and TV career, would understand better
than most the flip side of fame. For the past two years, he's been
busily crafting a larger-than-life portrayal of fellow thespian
John Barrymore (1882-1942), perhaps the best-ever example of an
entertainment legend unhinged by success, at least until Don
Simpson came wobbling along.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Barrymore,'' which opened Wednesday night at the Ahmanson
Theatre, Plummer _ who won a Tony award for the role _ becomes the
legendarily reckless ``clown prince'' of the American stage and the
bad seed of its esteemed first family. The younger brother of Ethel
and Lionel, and grandfather to Drew, ``Jack'' Barrymore had the
awesome talent _ as well as the fatal misfortune _ to peak early in
life.
</P>
<P>
   In 1920, he took Broadway by storm with his star turn in
``Richard III,'' followed by an even more celebrated ``Hamlet''
three years later. From there it was on to Hollywood, where
Barrymore made more than 50 films, including classics like ``Grand
Hotel'' and ``Dinner at Eight.''
</P>
<P>
   Witty, roguishly handsome and given to all manner of pranks,
Jack was a lively companion and conversationalist. But, speeded by
alcohol and his own personal demons, he began sinking into the
black hole of his own excessive personality. By the time of his
death, he'd become a parody of himself, frequently cast in movies
as a washed-up, dissipated actor, a cruel if strangely regal shadow
of his former greatness.
</P>
<P>
   William Luce's play takes place in the final year of Barrymore's
life, on the stage of a Manhattan theater where the actor has
privately gone to rehearse (and attempt to relive) his triumphant
Richard III. As an unseen prompter named Frank tries to jump-start
the actor's booze-addled memory, Barrymore recounts his tragicomic
life, makes risque jokes, sings, dapperly executes a few dance
steps, brushes off his four failed marriages as ``bus accidents,''
and gradually lays bare the desolation and despair behind the
charismatic bon vivant.
</P>
<P>
   To say the Canadian-born Plummer's performance has been
well-received would be a whopping understatement. Vincent Canby
described the performance as one of ``dazzling'' virtuosity, while
New York magazine's peppery John Simon described Plummer's
Barrymore as ``ready to pounce on every passing one-liner or wring
tears from licking his private wounds in public.''
</P>
<P>
   Basically a solo show, ``Barrymore'' is the latest in a string
of one-person biographical plays by Luce, who previously authored
``The Belle of Amherst,'' about poet Emily Dickinson, and
``Lucifer's Child,'' about ``Out of Africa'' author Isak Dinesen,
both of which starred Julie Harris.
</P>
<P>
   When ``Barrymore'' opened on Broadway two years ago, it came on
the heels of Nicol Williamson's one-man play ``Jack: A Night on the
Town With John Barrymore.'' Asked if he had any hesitation about
following Williamson's show so closely, Plummer immediately replies
that he wasn't because ``Jack'' simply ``didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't go, but my spies were there,'' he says in a
mock-conspiratorial voice, ``and they were wondering, because he
(Williamson) didn't even try to look like him (Barrymore) or sound
like him, which is most odd. I think it was a little vehicle, and
he was trying it out. ... There's not one ounce of similarity
between our two Barrymores. Even if Nicol's had been a hit, I think
we still could've done it. After all, two `Hamlets' have played on
Broadway at the same time. No one's to say one is better than the
other.''
</P>
<P>
   While scores of broken lives have been blamed on Hollywood, in
Barrymore's case the cliche seems especially apt. Ironically,
perhaps no where else but in the old, studio-run movie industry
would Jack's antics have been so gamely permitted _ and so
tragically prolonged.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood, Plummer observes, was ``very fond of the Barrymores,
and they tolerated Jack because of his enormous stage reputation,
more than anything else, actually. So they were glad to have him,
and they were prepared to handle him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays, I think the business is so impersonal, and there are
so many different companies and different people, and people make
great successes and then they go under, and then someone else comes
and takes their place as producers, there's no time, sadly, for
anyone like Jack anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Though still perhaps best-known as Capt. Von Trapp in ``The
Sound of Music'' (which he reportedly once disparaged as ``The
Sound of Mucus''), Plummer has had an enviable run in movies
ranging from John Huston's ``The Man Who Would Be King,'' ``Star
Trek VI'' and ``Dolores Claiborne'' to Terry Gilliam's ``Twelve
Monkeys.'' He's currently working on a feature-film project with
director Michael Mann (``Heat'').
</P>
<P>
   Plummer also has continued to land such plummy roles as Iago
opposite James Earl Jones in the 1981-82 Tony Award-winning
production of ``Othello.'' He has acted throughout Europe and North
America, including London's National Theatre Company and the
Guthrie Theatre in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   He's also the head of his own acting mini-dynasty: Amanda
Plummer is his daughter by actress Tammy Grimes, the first of his
three wives.
</P>
<P>
   Having achieved his own career breakthrough as Henry V at
Canada's Stratford Festival in 1956, and returning frequently to
the stage, Plummer, 68, reckons that Barrymore might have fared
better if he'd shunned Hollywood's siren song and stuck to live
theater. Then, Plummer says, he might have realized ``how good he
really was.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even in this somewhat saner world, stick-to-itiveness was
never Jack's strong suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the theater, of course, he didn't have much discipline, and
he never played anything for very long except `Hamlet,' which he
played for 101 performances,'' Plummer says. ``The other (roles) he
played an astonishingly short time. I think `Richard III' was only
like three or four weeks. It's remembered marvelously because of
the mystique of the man. But he didn't have discipline, he didn't
know how to pace himself. Which was such a shame because, my god,
think of the marvelous roles he could have played, because he had
all that in him to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Luce's play passingly evokes Jack's famous siblings, the
real ghost stalking Jack is his father, Maurice, a stage performer
and patriarch of ``the Fabulous Barrymores.'' If madness, like
genius, is genetically transferred, then it's easy to understand
Jack's anxiety that he'd inherited the former along with the
latter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We deal with his pain about his father, because of the madness
that he is so terrified that he will inherit, and he probably did a
bit because they're all a bit mad _ wonderfully mad,'' Plummer says
of the clan. ``And I do think that the drinking is an inherited
thing. I think the genes did get passed down from one generation to
the other. I think the booze was part of their history, and their
inevitable destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Could Jack have avoided being undone by what Plummer calls his
``free spirit'' _ not to mention all those other spirits he so
lustily imbibed?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' Plummer says. ``But, of course, in those
days one enjoyed drinking. It didn't have the sort of curse on it
that it has now, like everything has a curse on it in the '90s _
god! Sex, drink, everything is just simply not permissible.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Not since the 1920s has the New York region witnessed
estate-building on the scale and pace of the late 1990s. These
aren't the dinky 10,000-square-foot McMansions that are crowding
the suburbs; they're serious turn-of-the-21st-century manor houses
of 15,000, 25,000 and 40,000 square feet and more.
</P>
<P>
   One problem with the new estates, however, is that they seem so,
well, new. But this isn't a problem if you have lots of new money.
Because, as more and more well-heeled homeowners are discovering,
you can simply pay architects, contractors and landscapers to make
the places look as if they've been there forever.
</P>
<P>
   One popular 1990s make-over is instant ivy implants _ the
equivalent of ear-level hair plugs and comb-overs for bald pates.
Two years ago, Ceci Bros., a site-management company in Greenwich,
Conn., installed 100 2- to 3-year-old ivy plants on the walls of a
17,000-square-foot, hand-cut granite house on 20 acres in North
Greenwich for a 31-year-old investment banker and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Masonry's a wealthy touch,'' Mike Ceci said, ``but the house
looked very cold and stiff.'' Working from extension ladders, his
crew hammered inch-long masonry nails into the mortar between the
stone, then wrapped galvanized wire around the heads of the nails
and painstakingly connected each runner or tendril. Each plant took
up to three hours to install, costing about $250 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Nabel's Nurseries in White Plains supplies mature ivy to Ceci
Bros. and other landscapers. To get a vigorous, estate-worthy
plant, Rudy Nabel, whose father started the nursery in 1942, packs
15 strong cuttings into a 7-gallon pot. In two years the ivy can
grow as high as 9 feet, with each cutting producing up to 30
tendrils.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a nonexistent crop five years ago,'' Nabel said.
``It's because of the instant gratification that consumers want
these days.''
</P>
<P>
   While on the grounds of the granite house in Greenwich, Ceci
Bros. also laid down a half-million dollars' worth of topsoil,
eight acres of sod, a truckload of old boxwood plants and hundreds
of perennials _ carrying out a design by the New York landscape
architect Edmund Hollander.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different now than in the mid-1980s,'' said Hollander,
whose firm in recent months has designed some 50 gardens and
exteriors for estates in Fairfield County, Conn., and Westchester
County and the Hamptons in New York. ``This is less splash and more
tradition and elegance. A lot of what's going on now is a
repetition of the 1920s.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's 1920s tradition at 1990s speed. ``I can't say to a
client, `This landscape's going to look great in the year 2015' _
that's not going to go over well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One tactic is to start planting vines and shrubs as soon as
construction begins, or build the house close to really old trees.
Frank Newbold, a broker with Sotheby's International Realty in East
Hampton, noted an imposing Adirondack-style house on Jericho Lane
that ``is so close to a huge tree that it looks as if it'd been
built at the same time the tree was planted, when in fact the house
went up last week.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are looking for roots,'' said Francis Fleetwood
of the East Hampton architectural firm Fleetwood Lenahan McMullin,
which over the past 18 years has designed the majority of the
shingle-style mansions in Southampton and East Hampton. ``They'd
all love to be born into a grand old house that had been handed
down through the generations. So would I.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mark Finlay, an architect in Fairfield, Conn., also designs what
he calls ``brand-new old buildings.'' ``It's all in the details,''
he says. ``It's custom windows and sills of 4{-inch-thick
bluestone. It's the way the mortar's done, it's the color of the
mortar _ sandy rather than gray.''
</P>
<P>
   Finlay recently designed a fieldstone house in New Canaan,
Conn., to look like an early colonial that had been added onto over
the years. For a brick mansion in Greenwich, the architect ordered
flat, untooled, rough-looking joints.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at old brick in Europe, it's really sloppy,'' he
said, ``because half the masons in Europe were drunk.'' Finlay
recalled telling the masons on the project, ```Go have lunch and
drink a couple of beers, then go to work.' They thought I was
nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Another European look especially popular in the Hamptons is the
massive chimney that stands on the horizon like the mast of a tall
ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chimneys were once a focal point, because that's how they
heated homes,'' said Frank Dalene of Telemark Construction in
Bridgehampton, which recently built a 17,000-square-foot,
cast-concrete house with three 35-foot-high stacks. ``Now they're
the focal point because they've become architectural details.''
</P>
<P>
   As with the new mansions themselves, homeowners want their
chimneys with old details: intricate patterns in the brickwork,
ornate corbeling and multiple decorative clay pots on top.
Fleetwood favors ``snow-washes'' _ up to 16 inches of mortar
mounded over the chimney caps.
</P>
<P>
   The shingled-down Hamptons are also experiencing a demand for
historicity. Ben Krupinski, an East Hampton contractor specializing
in big houses, is building three outsized stucco-and-limestone
mansions. He adds brown pigment to the raw concrete for an old
color and tone, and sandblasts the limestone to make it appear
weathered.
</P>
<P>
   Even Fleetwood has begun using stone in the foundations and
columns of his shingle houses. ``Stone implies permanence,'' he
said. ``Most people like stone. We like stone.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, nothing quite gives an old, weathered look as much as
old, weathered stone. Hollander imported several thousand square
feet of ``antique'' wall and paving stones from estates being
broken up in England, to use in terraces around an elegant house on
a private island off Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   And for the grounds of a new 40,000-square-foot stone house in
Westchester, he took moss- and lichen-covered boulders harvested
from a Connecticut field and arranged them in the middle of a
100-foot stream he's creating behind the house. ``You can't start
with new rock,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, back in Greenwich, the ivy implanted last year is now
15 feet high and thickening. If left alone, the air roots will
begin pulling the mortar away from the granite. Then the homeowners
must either pay to have the house given a light trim three times a
year, as estate owners did in the past _ or build a new mansion and
start all over again.

FINDING THE CHANNELS ON HDTV 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also CIR-CALL-LETTERS)  
(lb) 
 By ERIC A. TAUB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You've just decided to be not only the first on your
block, but the first in your city to buy one of those new digital
high-definition televisions. You don't mind taking out a second
mortgage and building an extra room to house your new $10,000 HDTV,
because you're eager to watch all the new super-sharp wide-screen
programs and the extra channels.
</P>
<P>
   But come Nov. 1, when digital programming begins, the question
might be not just which shows to watch, but how in the world to
find them all.
</P>
<P>
   In the rush to get digital transmissions, including HDTV, on the
air, a few small matters were left on the table _ like what to name
these new channels and how to steer viewers to them. That is an
issue because when the Federal Communications Commission allocated
every television network a second channel last year for the
transition to digital broadcasting, those new frequencies were
often nowhere near their corresponding analog frequencies.
</P>
<P>
   The problem becomes worse when a network or local station,
looking to make extra profits from advertising, decides to use its
new digital channel for four channels with ordinary picture quality
instead of one HDTV feed. What, for example, should the program
streams on a network's new four-channel digital feed be called?
Does each separate channel get new call letters?
</P>
<P>
   Before you postpone your HDTV purchase for fear that you will
never find anything, don't worry. It looks as though the problem
will be solved, even though the FCC has yet to take final action.
Last December, the Advanced Television Systems Committee, an
industry group, suggested to the government that if a network
decides to divide its digital channel into several programming
streams, each should be considered as part of the main number.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if a network decided to split its new digital
channel into four during the daytime for separate feeds of news,
sports, children's and soap opera programs, they would all use the
number for the main analog channel.
</P>
<P>
   If the network was CBS, for example, in New York City CBS would
still appear to be broadcasting at the top of the dial, on Channel
2. (There has never been a Channel 1, because the frequency
represented by that number has always been assigned to the
government.)
</P>
<P>
   Each of the four channels would also have a subnumber: The
sports service could be Channel 2-1, the soap opera service Channel
2-4 and so on. If all the bandwidth was being used for one HDTV
feed, it would be plain Channel 2.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike radio, which names its channels by the actual frequency,
like 1010 or 95.5, television channel numbering is arbitrary. The
television channel numbers 2, 3, etc., indicate only where the
channels lie on the dial, not frequencies.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's proposal also suggests a way for the network
affiliates to hang on to the cachet of the positions they now hold
on the analog dial. Even though NBC's Channel 4 in Los Angeles has
been reassigned to the Siberia of frequencies on the digital dial,
there is no reason that any viewer ever need know this.
</P>
<P>
   Under the committee's scheme, the true digital channel
assignments will be invisible. Instead, every time viewers hit the
old familiar Channel 4 on their digital-television remote controls,
the receivers will be programmed to find the new digital frequency
assignment _ even if it's actually Channel 65 or Channel 99. Data
sent along with the television signal will tell the digital
receiver where to look for the channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still haven't heard from the FCC regarding this proposal,''
said Craig Tanner, the executive director of the Advanced
Television Systems Committee. ``But it's not clear that they have
any interest in acting on it. However, all indications are that the
broadcasters and set manufacturers intend to use it.''
</P>
<P>
   John Tollefson, vice president and chief technology officer at
PBS, explained: ``Under the ATSC's suggested protocol, viewers who
tune into the PBS digital station Channel 26 in Washington, for
example, will then see a menu that asks them which of the Channel
26 feeds they want. It's an issue that will be resolved by the set
manufacturers.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   What the FCC has decided is that all digital channels will keep
the call letters now used for their current analog service and will
just add a suffix to indicate that it is a digital service. That is
good news for the United States' broadcast television and radio
stations, who have long promoted their call letters and channel
positions as important signposts in getting viewers to their
stations. The letters WCBS in New York, KTLA in Los Angeles and WGN
in Chicago are valuable franchises to their owners.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC says the entire digital feed of WABC in New York, for
example, will be known as WABC-DT (for Digital Television), whether
the station is broadcasting three or four feeds on the digital
channel during the day or one feed with high-definition programs at
night.
</P>
<P>
   When digital television hits its stride, major markets could be
looking at scores of additional channels and hundreds of additional
shows. So if you think your TV Guide is thick today, just wait a
few more years.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that viewers will rebel against printed program
listings the size of the Manhattan phone directory, all digital
transmissions will be encoded with a show's name, length and start
time. New digital sets will use that information to assemble and
display an on-screen electronic program grid covering nine hours.
Soon, programming your VCR will be easier than figuring out what to
watch.

 &HT;    Chesnutt's `Salesman' hard to define, easy to hear
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   R.E.M. isn't the only Georgia act with a transitional album
coming out soon. The sixth solo effort by the band's old pal Vic
Chesnutt, ``The Salesman and Bernadette,'' is due for release Nov.
10 on Atlanta-based Capricorn Records. The label signed the
distinctively Southern singer-songwriter after he was dropped by
Capitol Records this summer, with the new album already recorded,
no less.
</P>
<P>
   Tower Pulse magazine's electronic version _ epulse _ is already
raving about the disc. ``It's easier to describe what his music
isn't than what it is,'' a recent issue declares. ``The music
possesses qualities of country, but it's not country. It rocks a
bit, but it's not rock. It has horns, but it's neither ska nor
swing. Chesnutt's music is difficult to classify, but wonderful to
hear. He sings with such sincerity that his honesty is taken for
granted, and perhaps it's irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The musical styles on `The Salesman' vary, but the overall
sound is one of a haunting dissonance. `Square Room' is the best
example of this culminated effect. The song envelops you and you
feel almost suffocated by its yearning. `Why do I dream of a cozy
coffin? I had all these plans and great things to accomplish.' This
is the kind of record that makes you want to abandon your job and
apartment in the city for some rural shack, where you do nothing
but swill booze and sway to the music.''

<P>
   Though much of their audience _ inherited from the Vermont band
Phish _ threatens to paint them into a predictable corner, New
York's ultra-grooving Medeski, Martin &AMP; Wood continue to challenge
themselves. On its fifth album, and first for major label Blue
Note, the group deploys its most successful fusion yet of
jazz-inspired improvisation, greasy, organ-fueled funk and wiggy
conceptual gambits. It's hip, but hardly hippie. The
everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach is too tasteful to slide
into gimmickry. The trio's gift is to resolve every sonic tangent _
from the turntable eruptions of guest DJ Logic to Hawaiian
slack-key melodies to a gospelized nod to Sly Stone _ with a
limber, imaginative rhythmic sensibility.

   While this soundtrack from the recent VH1 documentary may prove
to be as refreshing as a cooling ocean breeze to fans, casual
listeners may find it something akin to an unanticipated encounter
with a jellyfish. ``Harmony'' is chock-full of demos, stereo
remixes, live tracks, an occasional stray unreleased recording and
even radio concert promos. The project is an audio archaeological
dig that produces little of value for the non-SPF protected. Two
exceptions: the jazzy, previously unreleased ``Soulful Old Man
Sunshine'' and an intriguing live rehearsal version of the always
gorgeous ``God Only Knows.'' But do we really need to be subjected
to Brian Wilson banging aimlessly on a piano and clucking like a
chicken during a demo session for ``Heroes and Villains'' while
mumbling, ``We're still working on this''? That's about as much fun
as sand in your shorts.

   One of the great lost voices of rock 'n' roll, Memphis
rockabilly legend Charlie Feathers was an inspiration to Elvis
Presley (he penned the King's first hit, the memorable ``I Forgot
to Remember to Forget'') and a whole twisted generation of
psycho-billies and roots-music fanatics. But, as the extensive and
eloquent notes in this two-CD package make poignantly clear,
Feathers never could get a break. Even this collection _ which
rounds up rare, or rarely heard, tunes he recorded for labels such
as Sun, King, Kay, Meteor, Perfect and, yes, Holiday Inn Records _
barely saw the light long enough for Feathers to enjoy some
latter-day acclaim. The author of ``Tongue-Tied Jill,'' ``Peepin'
Eyes'' and ``We're Getting Closer to Being Apart'' died Aug. 26 at
the age of 66. ``Get With It'' does Feathers justice, though: This
is one rockin' epitaph.

<P>
   He lives. Grand Ole Opry star and songwriting legend Bill
Anderson is back in the game with an album that will make fans of
1960s country flash back to the days when it was cool to light up a
Lucky. These 11 tunes are thoroughly ``Whisperin' Bill'' _ the
choking voice, maudlin lyrics and, yes, even those deliciously
hokey recitations. The lyrics here are the perfect blend of gut
emotion and the kind of unapologetic corniness that Robert Altman
exploited in the movie ``Nashville.'' Anderson explores all the
required country topics like a reference book: divorce (``The
Paper''), cheating (``Forgiveness'') and getting dumped (``Way Too
Much Time on My Hands''). One of the best is ``The Tips of My
Fingers,'' a remake of his 1960 classic on which he is joined by
Eddy Arnold, producer Steve Wariner, Roy Clark and Jean Shepard.
One thing stands out: These senior stars sound better than most
voices on today's country radio.

   That's the joint. That's the jam. Turn this up. Play it again.
That's the refrain from the Black Eyed Peas' first single, ``Joints
&AMP; Jam.'' But it really applies to just about every song on this
debut. Descendants of the easy, acid-jazz vibe of A Tribe Called
Quest, Digable Planets and the Roots, Black Eyed Peas go on to
distinguish themselves by incorporating Latin rhythms (``Karma'')
and R&AMP;B (``The Way U Make Me Feel'') alongside their lazy jazz and
turntable scratches. But lyrically, little that the positive-minded
Will.I.Am, Apl.de.Ap. and Taboo come up with is as memorable as
Quest's Q-Tip when he's spreading ``Butter.'' Their vocals just
glide along nicely with the groove. Which is why you turn records
up in the first place, isn't it?

 &HT;    Missy Elliott shows her stuff in `Fools'
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As one of the first female rappers to guide a soundtrack, Missy
``Misdemeanor'' Elliott will _ for novelty reasons alone _ get
accolades. The great thing is that she earns them.
</P>
<P>
   Her team-up with master beat-man Timbaland on ``Why Do Fools
Fall in Love'' is one of the few records this year that makes urban
contemporary music deserve both those labels.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of reaching back into the crates for a 1970s hit, which
propels so many a popular single today, Timbaland reaches forward
to bass lines aching with pre-millennial tension. And the pops,
quirks and human beat-boxing are a kinetic combination of both
electronic and vocal strengths.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, that's old news for anyone who's heard one of the
million-selling records Elliott and Timbaland have produced for
Aaliyah and Ginuwine. But here the two get to branch out beyond
their usual musical cohorts, giving SWV's Coko an impressive solo
bow (``He Be Back'') and R&AMP;B quartet Destiny's Child its most
vibrant song (``Get On the Bus'') since Wyclef Jean remixed ``No,
No, No.'' Better-written tracks by En Vogue, Mint Condition and
Next are staid, so much kindling stacked up against Missy's and
Timbaland's smokin' grooves.

   CLINFLA _ ORLANDO _ The president flies to Florida to test his
clout in a million-dollar fund-raising trip for gubernatorial
candidate Buddy MacKay. Clinton visits an Orlando elementary
school, a Democratic luncheon and a Miami fundraiser. A look at how
he is received. (MWilliams, Cox News Service)

<P>
   PBP-CLINTON-VISIT _ ORLANDO, Fla. _ Fresh from a new round of
apologies in the nation's capital, President Clinton flies to
Florida for warm greetings from school children and from loyal
Democrats. He then goes to two fundraisers to get $1 million for
Democratic Lt. Gov. Buddy MacKay, who is battling Republican Jeb
Bush.. (Crowley, Palm Beach Post)
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-ANALYSIS _ WASHINGTON _ With the delivery of Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr's report to Congress, the capital is plunged
into a state of high drama not seen for a quarter-century. The
Clinton and Nixon situations are in many ways similar, but in other
ways different. (Glass, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-ANALYSIS _ WASHINGTON _ Struggling to make peace with
his family, regain the support of his party and win back the trust
of the nation, President Clinton is waging his last campaign,
relying on a strategy that mixes the intensely personal style and
kitchen-table themes that carried him to the White House five years
ago. As he fights for political survival, and his lawyers grapple
with a massive report detailing potentially impeachable offenses,
Clinton is taking his message of hope and achievement to the
hinterlands, betting, once again, on his instincts for connecting
with the American people and his proven ability to gut it out when
times look bleak. (Deans, Cox News Service 800).

<P>
   LATAM-ECONOMY _ MIAMI _ Colombia may have devalued its currency,
and a military man who led a failed coup attempt may be the next
president of Venezuela. Yet when it comes to Latin America, all
eyes are on Brazil. Accounting for 45 percent of Latin America's
gross domestic product, Brazil's economy has the power to hold up,
or pull down, the entire region. And what happens in Brazil has
repercussions in the United States. American banks have twice as
much exposure to Brazil as to Russia, for example. (Emling, , Cox
News Service).

   JOURNAL-KUWAIT _ KUWAIT CITY, Kuwait _Nobody describes it better
than the Kuwaitis themselves. They will tell you about taxi drivers
who have maids and that it's common for families to have six or
seven cars. The problem, they readily admit, is that as Cadillacs
and Mercedes were coming into favor, work was going out of style.
My recent trip to Kuwait started with the government insisting that
it would pay all my bills for lodging, meals and laundry (I
declined), and ended with a hotel manager giving me a souvenir that
explained all the opulence I had seen: a plexiglass cube with a few
drops of shiny black oil swishing around in the center. (Kaplow,

 &HT;    Art, life a funny pair in `Colors'
 &HT;    By Steve Murray

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Primary Colors'' (R)
</P>
<P>
   Mike Nichols' film of the roman a clef proves what you might
have already suspected: When it comes to the White House in the
1990s, fiction can't improve on reality.
</P>
<P>
   John Travolta plays Bill Clinton stand-in Jack Stanton, a
Southern governor shaking hands through New Hampshire, angling to
be chief executive. He's aided by his wife, Susan (Emma Thompson),
whose cool demeanor masks a barely controlled fury at her husband's
many ``bimbo eruptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching it all is campaign recruit Henry Burton (Adrian
Lester), grandson of a renowned civil rights leader and a wide-eyed
witness to the world of Beltway spin. The movie's first hour is
full of dead-on satire and terrific comic actors, including Billy
Bob Thornton as the James Carville stand-in and Allison Janney as a
teacher (and Stanton conquest) who takes a hilarious stairway
pratfall. But the movie belongs to Kathy Bates, as a no-bull ally
who acts as the Stantons' pal and moral barometer. Unfortunately, a
contrived dilemma at the end undercuts a lot of the film's dark
wit.

 &HT;    Dialogue makes character less than charming

<TEXT>
<P>
   -- ``I Love You, Don't Touch Me'' (unrated) _ Katie (Marla
Schaffel) is an incurable romantic. Which, she says, is why she's
still a virgin. Initially, we're charmed. But then writer-director
Julie Davis gives her lines such as ``I'm just looking for a nice
Jewish guy with a big penis and a big wallet,'' and we're less
charmed. Katie's friend Ben (Mitchell Whitfield) would seem to fit
the bill, but Katie isn't attracted to him. Davis has a good grasp
of what it's like to be a nice Jewish girl. But her insights don't
go much deeper than dozens of routines by stand-up comics. And the
more we share Katie's life, the less interested we are. Grade: D+

IRAN'S PRESIDENT ISSUES STRONG WARNING ON AFGHANISTAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ Despite American calls for restraint, Iran's
president said Wednesday that his country would act ``in whichever
way we see fit'' to resolve a potentially explosive dispute with
the militant Taliban Islamic movement that controls most of
neighboring Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The warning by President Mohammad Khatami amplified the blunt
message already sent by Iran through a major troop buildup near the
Afghan border.
</P>
<P>
   Though Khatami pledged Wednesday that Iran would turn first to
diplomacy to resolve the crisis, he also suggested that the United
States had little business warning others against the use of
military force.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get worried when we act on our own borders to protect our
security,'' the Iranian president said of American officials. ``But
they allow themselves to launch long-distance missile strikes on
other countries and kill innocent people.''
</P>
<P>
   Khatami was clearly referring to the American cruise missile
attacks last month on sites in Afghanistan and Sudan. His comments
seemed intended to build a further case for possible Iranian
military strikes against the Taliban movement, a bitter rival that
Iran has held responsible for the disappearance of dozens of
Iranians, including 11 diplomats, during fighting in Afghanistan
last month.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranian buildup _ numbering some 70,000 troops and large
stocks of military equipment _ and nearly a week of warnings from
Tehran have prompted expressions of deep concern in Washington. On
Wednesday, State Department spokesman James Rubin urged
Afghanistan's neighbors ``to refrain from taking actions that could
further enlarge or inflame the conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Iran-based diplomats and other independent experts here said
Wednesday that they continued to regard all-out war as unlikely.
But they said it seemed possible that Iran would carry out at least
a limited punitive strike unless the Taliban respond soon to
Iranian demands for answers about the fate of its citizens. They
had been based in the northern, rebel-held town of Mazar-i-Sharif,
which was overrun by Taliban forces on Aug. 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you Americans know well, when harm comes to diplomats it is
seen as an insult to national dignity,'' one Western ambassador
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Iran has been a main backer of the forces seeking to prevent the
Taliban from consolidating its hold on Afghanistan, and that has
intensified a rivalry rooted in mutual suspicion.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It is not just that Iran, the world's main Shiite Muslim
bastion, and the Taliban, purist followers of the dominant Sunni
faith, represent two wings of a great Islamic schism that has
kindled centuries of mistrust.
</P>
<P>
   Both also see their own systems as models of the perfect Islamic
state, to such an extent that Iran _ which allows relatively
greater social freedom _ has accused the Taliban of giving Islam a
bad name. For its part, the Taliban has never shown much tolerance
for Shiites either within Afghanistan or abroad.
</P>
<P>
   There have been conflicting reports about whether the Iranians
missing in Afghanistan are dead or alive, and foreign diplomats say
it is perhaps equally possible that they are being held captive,
were deliberately slain or _ as the Taliban have suggested _ were
unlucky enough to have been caught in crossfire.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has not been alone in urging that the conflict
be resolved peacefully. Both Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have warned
that the use of force by either side could further unsettle a
volatile region, and a U.N. spokesman said on Wednesday that
Secretary-General Kofi Annan had been talking to the parties
``about ways to sort this out.''
</P>
<P>
   Working with the help of Pakistani intermediaries, Iranian
diplomats have met during the last week with some Taliban
officials, and have succeeded in winning the release of five
Iranian truck drivers freed by the Taliban as a goodwill gesture.
</P>
<P>
   But Iran says that the Taliban has yet to account for at least
45 Iranians who have been missing since the fall of Mazar-i-Sharif,
which had been the headquarters of an Iranian-backed militia
alliance fighting against Taliban forces.
</P>
<P>
   Some reports have said the Iranian diplomats might have been
killed when the Taliban seized the Iranian consulate in the city.
One top Taliban leader has been quoted as saying that the diplomats
were ``probably dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is
commander-in-chief of Iran's half-million strong armed forces, said
late last week that there would be no confrontation between Iran
and the Taliban, despite the buildup of elite Revolutionary Guards
and other Iranian forces who have remained in place after staging
high-profile war games near the Afghan border.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, however, Iranian officials have seemed to
suggest that their patience may soon wear thin. On Wednesday,
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharazzi called on the Taliban to
``respond positively'' to Iran's demands ``before it is too late.''
</P>
<P>
   And Khatami, a relatively moderate Shiite Muslim cleric who has
tried to build bridges with many of his country's longtime foes,
sounded positively bitter Wednesday as he complained that others
around the world seemed indifferent to the missing Iranians' fate.
</P>
<P>
   He even said he held the Taliban responsible for ``a human
tragedy'' and ``genocide'' in Afghanistan, where the movement
captured the capital, Kabul, two years ago and now controls some 90
percent of the territory.
</P>
<P>
   Although Khatami did not elaborate on his remarks, he seemed to
be referring to findings issued last week by the human rights group
Amnesty International that thousands of Shiites had been killed
during the taking of Mazar-i-Sharif by the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking during a meeting with visiting foreign ministers from
Armenia and Turkey, Khatami said: ``We cannot remain indifferent
towards the lives of our citizens, and particularly our diplomats,
who have been attacked and taken hostage in violation of
international law. We will act in whatever way we see fit to
protect our rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The harder line from Tehran may have been prompted in part by
scathing statements from the Taliban, who have imposed on
Afghanistan a far more rigid Islamic system.
</P>
<P>
   Mawlawi Noor Mohammed Sageb, the Taliban chief justice, was
quoted by the militia's religious radio station Shariat this week
as saying that Iran ``should stop its undue military warnings and
threats'' so that it would ``not act as a tool in the hand of the
enemies of Islam.''

 &HT;    Author hoping success of second novel equals the first
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Nicholas Evans was a child reading ``Little Red Riding
Hood,'' it didn't make sense to him that this dumb girl would
survive and the sleek, elegant wolf would die. That's one reason
wolves are the heroes in ``The Loop,'' Evans' first novel since he
raked in $8 million for ``The Horse Whisperer'' three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Published this week, ``The Loop'' (Delacorte, $25.95) revolves
around the return of a pack of wolves to a small town in Montana.
Ranchers _ in particular the tough-talking Buck Calder _ see the
wolves as a threat to be eliminated. Calder's stuttering son, Luke,
is not so certain, especially after falling in love with wolf
biologist Helen Ross.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like `The Horse Whisperer,' this is a story of redemptive
love,'' Evans says from his London home. ``It's about hatred and
intolerance and how they can tear apart a family, even a whole
town.''
</P>
<P>
   The 48-year-old British television producer and screenwriter is
well aware that it will be difficult to follow in the huge
hoofprints of his best-selling debut novel. Despite being panned by
some critics (The New York Times called it ``sentimentally bloated,
and wholly devoid of authentic feeling''), ``The Horse Whisperer''
sold more than 12 million copies worldwide, thanks in part to
Robert Redford's film version.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Delacorte Press, which shipped 750,000 copies to
bookstores this week, is confident Evans' second novel will be a
howling success.
</P>
<P>
   Evans got the idea when he was in Montana researching ``The
Horse Whisperer'' in the early 1990s and met Bob Ream, a wolf
biologist.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me about the proposed release of 66 wild Canadian
wolves into Yellowstone Park and Idaho and how he opposed it
because it was going to create too much conflict with local
ranchers,'' Evans says. ``I was intrigued by the extraordinary
passions that this animal seemed able to generate. In a way, the
conflict over the wolf was a conflict about the future of the West
and the wild itself.''
</P>
<P>
   To the ranchers, Evans says, the wolf is a symbol of the
government's interference in their lives as well as that of media
moguls and Hollywood types who are moving into the state and buying
thousands of acres.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ranchers feel beleaguered. It's as if the wolf represents
everything they find repressive about the central government. They
are being told constantly that they have to amend the way in which
they ranch, the way they fence their creeks.
</P>
<P>
   Everything is under some kind of dictate from the federal
government. For the federal government to release these wolves in
their midst and to be told they can be put in jail and fined
$100,000 if they shoot a wolf, they feel angry about this.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``loop'' in the book's title has several layers of meaning,
Evans says. One of the characters uses a wire loop device for
killing wolf pups. And, among Native Americans, the loop refers to
the circle of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a Native American legend that says the souls of all
the slaughtered wolves are living on some faraway mountain waiting
for a time when man again understands his place in the natural
scheme of things and it is safe for them to return. If that time
comes, the wolf's return will complete the loop.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans, who grew up watching TV westerns such as ``Rawhide'' and
``Wagon Train,'' began writing ``The Horse Whisperer'' more out of
financial desperation than creative inspiration. Married with three
children, Evans had spent two years trying to raise money for a
film he had written. When the deal fell through, he decided to
pursue a story he had heard about men who were able to tame wild
horses by whispering to them.
</P>
<P>
   He spent the next six weeks touring the American West, listening
to tapes of Aaron Copland and Neil Young and interviewing animal
healers. Back in London with mortgage payments overdue, he churned
out 215 pages and showed the partial manuscript to his agent. A
bidding frenzy ensued and Evans became a millionaire before he had
finished the novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life was pretty turbulent but it was wonderful,'' says
Evans, who has limited his indulgences to a new house and car and
helicopter ski trips in the Canadian Rockies. ``I'm just grateful
it happened to me in my 40s rather than my 20s. But when you've got
teenage kids, it helps keep your ego in balance. They slice you off
at the knees pretty quick.''

 &HT;    Latest rap volley by Canibus more huff and puff than punch
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray

<TEXT>
<P>
   Forgive us, Public Enemy.
</P>
<P>
   You told us a decade ago not to believe the hype. But nooooo, we
got all caught up in the recent old-school-style battle on record
between rap veteran LL Cool J and newcomer Canibus. Cool J struck
first on ``4,3,2,1,'' demanding that Canibus idolize him and the
microphone tattooed on his arm. Canibus came back with Mike Tyson
in tow on the single ``Second Round K.O.,'' taunting Cool J that he
was actually copying Canibus' style.
</P>
<P>
   It was getting good.
</P>
<P>
   Then Canibus hinted that he was bigger than comeback records on
his dynamic pairing with Youssou N'Dour on ``How Come,'' featured
on the ``Bulworth'' soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   And then Canibus came up with this. ``Can-I-Bus'' _ another way
of asking ``Can I get a chance to rap?'' _ should be answered with
an unflinching ``no.'' Not when Canibus arrives with such momentum
only to offer a debut album composed mostly of songs written way
better than they're delivered. On ``Patriots'' he boasts, ``It's
inevitable in '98 I'm a blow.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can-I-Bus''
</P>
<P>
   Canibus. Universal. 13 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Can he bust? Sometimes. But considering the
expectations, Canibus merely goes splat.

 &HT;    `Celebrity Skin' no Hole in one
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Face it: Hole's 1994 album, ``Live Through This,'' was as good
as it's ever going to get for Courtney Love, rock star. It was a
brilliant, ripping act of defiance, exposure and, yes, ego that
caught people off guard and fit perfectly into an awful cultural
moment (the suicide of Love's husband, Nirvana frontman Kurt
Cobain). Four years later, Love has gone from grunge queen to
Versace model, enjoyed who knows how much plastic surgery and
become a viable Hollywood presence (co-starring next with Ben
Affleck, no less). Of course ``Celebrity Skin,'' the endlessly
awaited sequel, was going to be lame; how could it not? And how can
you not love it anyway?
</P>
<P>
   It's the best of Courtney and the worst of Courtney.
Multitracked to the high heavens and bathed in a sunny gloss, these
dozen songs scream sellout even as they indulge in subterfuge.
Titanic, strikingly catchy riffs launch tune after tune, while Love
surveys a Los Angeles of ``beautiful garbage'' and airbrushed baby
dolls that has occupied the American narrative from Nathanael West
through the '80s punk-rock group X.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, look at my face,'' she sings in the title track. ``My name
is Might-Have-Been/My name is Never Was.'' Yet, like her opening
claim to be ``a walking study in demonology,'' the caustic,
self-aware drama never rises anyplace very interesting. But you
keep listening anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebrity Skin''
</P>
<P>
   Hole. DGC. 12 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A
</P>
<P>
   Love-hate relationship.

 &HT;    How to make the most of savory seasonings, without letting them
take over your kitchen
 &HT;    By John Kessler
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It all started innocently enough, with a dozen spool-sized
containers of dried herbs and spices in a plastic carousel. They
sat there full of promise, their names beckoning under shiny red
caps. Leaf Oregano. Rubbed Sage. Ground Allspice. C'mon, they
seemed to say _ put a little spice in your life!
</P>
<P>
   But that was before.
</P>
<P>
   Before we somehow amassed 11 different containers of cinnamon.
Before our friends gave us that set of seasoning blends in
decorative terra-cotta pots for Christmas 1996. Before we tracked
down a jar of herbes de Provence for a recipe that required a
half-teaspoonful of it. Before we went on that short-lived Indian
food kick and had to clear extra shelf space for a subcontinental
spice bazaar.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it: Our collection of canisters and bottles has grown
like a multi-legged monster, sending its tendrils throughout the
kitchen. What do we have now? The spice cabinet that ate
Philadelphia, that's what.
</P>
<P>
   What should we keep, what should we pitch, and how on earth are
we going to find uses for that small fortune in flavor that stares
back at us each and every day?
</P>
<P>
   For too many of us, the spice cabinet has become a kind of
reliquary. We venerate the saffron threads from Spain and the New
Mexican red chile powder brought back from that trip to Santa Fe,
but we're not exactly sure what to do with them.
</P>
<P>
   If only we'd think to crumble a pinch of saffron into a pot of
rice. Or blend the red chile with cumin and oregano _ homemade
chili powder! _ before firing up a favorite Mexican dish.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's a lot to wade through. Some dried herbs and
spices _ parsley, cilantro and lemongrass come to mind _ are so
inferior to their readily available fresh counterparts that they
shouldn't be allowed to take up any space in the cabinet. Others _
particularly ground spices _ have a relatively short shelf life, so
that older ones may not add anything to your cooking other than a
slight bitter aftertaste.
</P>
<P>
   Savvy cooks may know to blend some nutmeg, ginger, cinnamon and
cloves for pumpkin pie spice to avoid an extra purchase. Or to
pulverize leaf herbs in a spice grinder to make poultry seasoning.
</P>
<P>
   But most of us need some guidance. Our spice cabinets have
become beasts that need taming.

 &HT;    Extras give `Camelot' retro touch
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you missed ``Camelot'' starring Robert Goulet, fear not. You
can watch the 1968 movie version in the comfort of your own home.
</P>
<P>
   Baby boomers might want to think of ``Camelot'' as a kind of
nostalgia trip. It's probably the movie your parents were watching
while you were trying to shut down your college.
</P>
<P>
   Kitsch observations aside, this is a sumptuous adaptation of the
Lerner and Loewe musical known for two things: being the unofficial
anthem of the Kennedy White House and not being as good as ``My
Fair Lady.''
</P>
<P>
   The recently released DVD offers Richard Harris and Vanessa
Redgrave, both looking incredibly young and studio-sanitized, as
King Arthur and Queen Guinevere. It also has a wonderfully
re-mastered soundtrack; you'll think you've got an orchestra pit in
your living room.
</P>
<P>
   Of the extra features, which range from a short discourse on the
legend of King Arthur to a selection of five theatrical trailers,
the most intriguing is a featurette on the ``Camelot'' premiere.
The footage is a kind of loopy time capsule. Among the luminaries
attending the Times Square event are Truman Capote, Ed Sullivan,
Ethel Merman and ``the Kennedy Girls'' (they mean Ethel Kennedy and
Pat Lawford). Harris, decked out in Sgt. Pepper finery, looks as if
he wandered in from an entirely different soundstage.

 &HT;    Spices: Blending together something special
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are almost as many seasoning mixes on the market as there
are herbs and spices. Here are some classic blends you can make
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   -- Bouquet garni: A classic for flavoring soups, stews and
sauces. Here's a version using dried herbs: Combine equal parts
crushed dried bay leaves, parsley and thyme; place in cheesecloth.
Tie the cheesecloth with kitchen string or cotton thread and add to
soup or stew. Remove the cheesecloth bag at the end of cooking.
</P>
<P>
   -- Cajun seasoning: Here's a blend that delivers Cajun flavors
to roasted or grilled meats, gumbos and jambalayas. Crush 1 fat
clove of garlic and 1/2 small onion together in a mortar and then
mix in: 1 teaspoon paprika, 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, 1/2
teaspoon ground cumin, 1/2 teaspoon mustard powder, 1/2 teaspoon
cayenne pepper, 1 teaspoon dried thyme, 1 teaspoon dried oregano
and 1 teaspoon salt.
</P>
<P>
   -- Chili powder: Chili powders vary. Here are the proportions
for a versatile New Mexican variety. Combine and toast in a skillet
over medium heat for 2 minutes: 5 tablespoons ground mild chile
peppers, such as New Mexico, pasilla or ancho, 2 tablespoons dried
oregano, 1 1/2 tablespoons ground cumin and 1/2 teaspoon ground red
pepper.
</P>
<P>
   -- Chinese five-spice powder: This mixture is used throughout
southern China and Vietnam to season roast meat and poultry and to
flavor marinades. Grind 1 tablespoon star anise, 1 tablespoon
Sichuan pepper, 1/2 tablespoon cinnamon, 1 tablespoon fennel seeds,
1/2 tablespoon cloves.
</P>
<P>
   -- Curry powder: There are many different curries, and they vary
from the yellow curries of India to the hot-red curries of
Thailand. Here's a basic Madras curry mixture. Toast the following
ingredients in a medium-hot skillet until a shade darker and
fragrant, about 4 minutes: 6 tablespoons whole coriander seeds, 4
tablespoons whole cumin seeds, 3 tablespoons yellow split peas
(chana dal), 1 tablespoon black peppercorns, 1 tablespoon black
mustard seeds, 5 dried red chile peppers, 10 fresh or dried curry
leaves. Once these are toasted, combine with 2 tablespoons of
fenugreek seeds and grind together. Then add 3 tablespoons
turmeric.
</P>
<P>
   -- Garam masala: This blend of spices is traditional in the
foods of northern India, including tandoori. First, put 1/2 cup
green or black cardamom pods into a heavy plastic bag and smash
with a rolling pin until lightly crushed. Pull out the tiny seeds
and discard the pods. Combine the seeds with: 1/3 cup whole cloves,
1/4 cup cumin seeds, 1/4 cup black peppercorns and 5 cinnamon
sticks, about 3 inches long. Grind to a powder in a spice mill and
store.
</P>
<P>
   -- Herbes de Provence: This is good for braised meats and with
root vegetables. Grind 4 tablespoons dried thyme, 2 tablespoons
dried marjoram, 1 tablespoon dried rosemary, 2 tablespoons dried
savory, 1 tablespoon dried lavender flowers and 3 bay leaves.
</P>
<P>
   -- Pickling spices: This mixture is used when pickling fruits
and vegetables and for chutneys and spiced vinegar. Combine 1
tablespoon whole black peppercorns, 1 tablespoon yellow mustard
seeds, 1 tablespoon hot red pepper flakes, 1 tablespoon allspice
berries, 1 tablespoon dill seed, 1 tablespoon ground mace, 1
crushed 2-inch cinnamon stick, 2 crumbled bay leaves, 1 teaspoon
whole cloves and 2 tablespoons ground ginger.
</P>
<P>
   -- Pumpkin pie spice: At Thanksgiving, open your spice cabinet
and combine the following: 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon
ginger, 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg and 1/4 teaspoon cloves.

ALIENS HAVE LANDED AND HEADS WILL ROLL 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If 3-D spectacles like Quake 2 and Unreal are the ``Armageddon''
and ``Deep Impact'' of the computer gaming world, Hedz is
``Trainspotting'' _ a highly idiosyncratic piece of work, shot
through with a certain macabre wit, straight from the land of
whisky and haggis.
</P>
<P>
   Developed by VIS, one of the budding start-ups in Scotland's
Silicon Glen, Hedz is a darkly amusing, bizarre little game. The
premise: A race of super-intelligent aliens has eliminated
pestilence, famine and war on their planet. They've evolved to such
a high degree that they all look the same. They've solved the
mysteries of the universe. And basically, they're bored.
</P>
<P>
   So, having cracked time travel, one of them beams down to planet
Earth, finds all these weird-looking creatures (human beings) and
discovers that by decapitating them and plugging their heads on top
of his, he can assume their personalities and skills.
</P>
<P>
   So he chops off a bunch of Earthling heads from various points
in human history, takes them back to his planet and introduces a
new sport based on cranium-to-cranium combat in Hedz (Head Extreme
Destruction Zone), a gladiator arena. There, the aliens run around
with human heads for helmets, duking it out with the skills and
attributes of their cloned trophy specimens.
</P>
<P>
   Each player roves through the destruction zone in search of new
heads, which can be captured by attacking them on sight. After
enough battle hits, the target head pops off its alien body and
bounces around the landscape, at which point any other player,
including the victim, can collect the head, carry it to the Dunk
zone and dunk it into a star-shaped goal, whereupon the head-ware
becomes available for use in the next round. Plant it on your own
noggin, and voila, you have a new weapon.
</P>
<P>
   At any given time, you can carry around five of 225 potential
heads. It is a matter of optimizing your skill set with the right
combination of attack, defense, vehicle-based, aerial-based and
medical abilities.
</P>
<P>
   There is a tribal warrior head that allows you to throw spears.
A punk rocker from London spits on people in a lovely, colorful
cartoon fashion. You can turn into General Patton, who has a tank
that fires missiles, or a guy with an aircraft carrier for a head.
Or the Highland hammer thrower. Or the bouncing sheep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every game made in Scotland has to have a sheep in it _ it's
kind of de rigueur these days,'' said Chris van der Kyul, chief
executive of VIS, who describes himself as Scotland's first
second-generation multimedia developer. ``There's a tradition in
Britain,'' he explained. ``In Victorian times, when you were old
enough, your dad would send you out to clean chimneys and stuff.
Well, my dad sent me out to start programming by the time I was 14.
He was a multimedia developer, way, way back in the mists of time,
all original educational software for Apple IIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually quite funny when you look at the developer
history in Scotland,'' he continued. ``We had things like the
Spectrum, this tiny little computer that sold for, like, 50 bucks
and was almost as powerful as a Commodore 64. Those were actually
manufactured in Dundee, which is where I come from. We used to
basically get these things for free, you know, out the back of the
factory. So there wasn't a kid in Dundee who didn't have about two
or three of these computers at home. So we all started getting
together. The first thing you start doing is, like, copying games
and looking at them. And then, slowly but surely, we all started
coding demos and stuff. And the tradition's really grown up from
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as the child is the father to the man, the childhood
computer gives rise to the software development community. And that
is a defining difference between the United States and Europe. In
the United States, computers were cheap and sputtery for a short
period in the 1970s. Then they suddenly got very powerful and very
expensive, and the computer stopped being a hobbyist machine. It
became a serious piece of equipment for serious work. It was not a
toy, or a thing that lived in a child's room.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades later, a generation of North American software
developers are producing high-budget games for high-power PCs _
games that require cutting-edge accelerator cards and take up 450
megabytes on your hard drive. They're spectacular products; the
special effects make your head spin. But they tend to revolve
around the technology of the moment, and to copy each other.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, and particularly in Britain, computers started out
cheap and stayed cheap for a long time. Commodores and Sinclairs
survived the 1980s, and Amigas are still kept in fine working order
by hobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   None of these computers were powerful, even at the time, but
they were accessible. They could be given to children without a big
hit to the family budget. And a whole generation of boys grew up to
be programmers who know how to design great games with severely
limited hardware.
</P>
<P>
   That is why there are more console developers in Europe,
proportionally, than in the United States, and why so many
PC-to-console conversions are done overseas. A console doesn't have
the speed or power of a personal computer, but it is capable of
great things if you know how to work within those constraints.
</P>
<P>
   Spectrum alumni understand how to do that, particularly in
Scotland, where programmers have transformed their fabled
predilection for thrift into an almost obsessive attention to
software efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really used to squeezing the most out of a small piece
of hardware,'' van der Kyul said. ``We're more inclined to sit with
a Playstation and say, OK, I know it has the power of an average
dishwasher, but if we really shoehorn it and come up with some
innovative technology, I'm sure we can get it to do something. My
head of software, Paddy, is classic for that. He'll come into my
office with a big smile on his face and say, `I saved five
processor cycles in render time today.' His attitude is always how
can I make it faster, how can I make it tighter, to make sure that
the code really flies. And it does make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the difference between a gas guzzler and a subcompact coupe
_ between a Corvette and a Karmann Ghia. Or between ``Jurassic
Park'' and ``Four Weddings and a Funeral.'' &QL;

   Clip and save this chart on use of common herbs and spices
</P>
<P>
   Allspice
</P>
<P>
   It may taste like a peppery blend of cloves, cinnamon and
nutmeg, but allspice is all one spice _ the unripened buds of an
evergreen tree dried to a red-brown. Available whole and ground.
</P>
<P>
   -- Uses: Sweet or savory dishes, including shellfish, meat,
gravies, ketchup, pickling blends, pies, cakes, cookies, chutney,
relishes and preserves.
</P>
<P>
   -- Cuisines: The best allspice smells like cloves and is grown
in Jamaica, where it is used in soups and stews and is the defining
spice in jerk seasoning. Others, which taste like bay rum, are
grown in Honduras and Guatemala. In Germany it is used in
sauerbraten.
</P>
<P>
   -- Tips: Add a few berries to chicken soup.
</P>
<P>
   -- Flavor affinities: Enhances other spices and can be used in
the pepper mill along with equal amounts of green, black and white
peppercorns.
</P>
<P>
   Anise
</P>
<P>
   Seeds are harvested from an annual herb in the parsley family.
Although it has a licorice flavor, it is not related to true
licorice. Spanish anise seed is premium and bold. Anise also is
grown in Turkey and Egypt. Flavor is similar to that of fennel.
</P>
<P>
   -- Uses: Cakes, cookies, breads (may be used in place of caraway
in rye bread) and other sweets, and many beverages in Europe,
including the cordial anisette, pastis in France and ouzo in
Greece. Sold as seeds and extract.
</P>
<P>
   -- Cuisines: Portuguese, Italian, German, Scandinavian.
</P>
<P>
   -- Tips: Stir crushed seeds into yogurt for a chicken marinade.
</P>
<P>
   -- Flavor affinities: Sweets, seafood, nuts, figs, dried fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Basil
</P>
<P>
   A member of the mint family native to India, more than 150
varieties are grown throughout the Mediterranean and in California.
</P>
<P>
   -- Uses: Tomato sauces for pizza and spaghetti, sausage, soup,
salad dressings, fish, egg and rice dishes.
</P>
<P>
   -- Cuisines: Italian, Thai.
</P>
<P>
   -- Tips: When dried, the leaves have a more pronounced mint
flavor. Dried basil is best added toward the end of cooking to
preserve its aroma.
</P>
<P>
   -- Flavor affinities: Oregano, parsley, rosemary, thyme, sage
and saffron.
</P>
<P>
   Bay leaves
</P>
<P>
   From the evergreen laurel tree native to the Mediterranean, bay
leaves are imported from Turkey. They have a woody, astringent
flavor with a hint of mint.
</P>
<P>
   -- Uses: Meat and vegetable dishes, soup, sauces and, sometimes,
custards. Vital in bouquet garni.
</P>
<P>
   -- Cuisines: French, Mediterranean and Indian.
</P>
<P>
   -- Tips: Remove bay leaves before serving; crumble before adding
if more flavor is desired.
</P>
<P>
   -- Flavor affinities: Parsley, thyme, other Italian seasonings.
</P>
<P>
   Caraway seeds
</P>
<P>
   Tiny brown seeds from a member of the parsley family pack a
pungent anise flavor that's sharp and slightly bitter. They are
available whole and ground.
</P>
<P>
   -- Uses: The characteristic flavor in rye bread; often used in
potato salad, noodles and sauerkraut, and with rich meats including
duck, goose, pork and sausages.
</P>
<P>
   -- Cuisines: Most often used by Austrian and German bakers to
flavor breads and pastries; also Tunisian harissa (hot chili
sauce).
</P>
<P>
   -- Tips: Toast lightly before using in cheese dishes or potato
salad; use sparingly, as the flavor dominates a dish; add during
the last 15 minutes of cooking time.
</P>
<P>
   -- Flavor affinities: Sour cream, meat stews, root vegetables
such as potatoes and carrots.
</P>
<P>
   Cardamom
</P>
<P>
   This complex spice has a grapefruit-like, floral flavor with
green and woody notes and menthol undertones, something like
ginger. It comes from the dried, unripened fruit of a perennial and
is the world's third-most-expensive spice, behind only saffron and
vanilla. Tiny brown seeds are enclosed in cream-colored pods. Brown
cardamom pods should be avoided, since they are not true cardamom
and have a camphor flavor. Two kinds are grown in India, which are
considered premium; others are grown in Guatemala, Mexico and Sri
Lanka.
</P>
<P>
   -- Uses: Cakes, pastries, liqueurs, Turkish coffee, curries,
pilafs, pickles, pickled herring, meat dishes, punches, spiced
wines, custards and fruit dishes.
</P>
<P>
   -- Cuisines: Indian, Middle Eastern, German, Russian,
Scandinavian.
</P>
<P>
   -- Tips: Available whole and ground. Buy green or white pods,
discard pods, roast the brown-black seeds in a dry pan, then grind
as needed. Both seeds and ground spice lose flavor quickly.
</P>
<P>
   -- Flavor affinities: Essential in curry powders from northern
India and Pakistan; and in kulfi, a rich
almond-and-pistachio-flavored ice cream; and it's often used as an
addition to the five basic spices in Chinese five-spice powder. It
goes well with fruit and pork dishes, and is a natural breath
freshener.
</P>
<P>
   Cayenne
</P>
<P>
   The ground form of the dried, ripened fruit pod of Capsicum
frutescens, native to tropical America, the West Indies and South
America, is called cayenne. Unrelated to pepper berries of the
Eastern world, it is still sometimes called red pepper.
</P>
<P>
   -- Uses: In spice blends, barbecue rubs, chili, spaghetti sauce.
Crushed pepper is often sprinkled on salads, pizza and other foods
at the table.
</P>
<P>
   -- Cuisines: Cajun, Mexican, Chinese, Thai, Indian, Indonesian,
North African.
</P>
<P>
   -- Tips: Available ground and crushed. Use sparingly, to taste;
only a few shakes can set mouths afire. Store in the refrigerator
as it's prone to bug infestation.
</P>
<P>
   -- Flavor affinities: Cilantro, basil, ginger, oregano,
cinnamon, black pepper, cumin, fennel and flat-leaf parsley.
</P>
<P>
   Celery seeds
</P>
<P>
   These tiny, brown, aromatic seeds have a slightly bitter, strong
celery flavor. They are sold whole or ground, or ground with salt
for celery seasoning.
</P>
<P>
   -- Uses: Whole seeds are widely used in breads, pickles, tomato
ketchup, potato salad and salad dressings.
</P>
<P>
   -- Cuisines: Often used in Scandinavian and Russian sauces and
soups.
</P>
<P>
   -- Tips: Crush seeds lightly before using. Try in fish or egg
dishes.
</P>
<P>
   -- Flavor affinities: With other spices in pickling mixes and
with tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   Most cinnamon brought to the United States isn't really cinnamon
at all, but cassia, from the bark of an evergreen grown in
Southeast Asia. True cinnamon comes from Sri Lanka, where it is
grown plantation-style and harvested from the small branches of old
trees. Ground or stick form.
</P>
<P>
   -- Uses: Ground, it is used in cakes, buns, cookies and pies,
stewed fruits and curries. In stick form, it is used in beverages
including coffee, cider, mulled wine, tea and hot chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   -- Cuisines: Worldwide. Often used in garam masala in India and
it is one of the five spices in Chinese five-spice powder.
</P>
<P>
   -- Tips: Use a pinch in any meat stew and in stuffing for duck
or goose or any stuffing with dried fruit.
</P>
<P>
   -- Flavor affinities: Lamb, sweets, dried fruits, baked acorn
squash, sweet potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Cloves
</P>
<P>
   Strong, fruity and almost hot, cloves leave a numbing sensation
in the mouth. They are the dried, unopened, nail-shaped flavor buds
of an evergreen tree, probably native to Indonesia. Today, most
come from the Indian Ocean basin, where buds are harvested by hand
and spread in the sun to dry.
</P>
<P>
   -- Uses: Whole _ with ham, pork, pickled fruit, onions, gravy
and syrup; ground _ spice cake, pumpkin pie, fruitcake,
gingerbread, chili sauce, ketchup and in blends. Half the world's
production is used to flavor cigarettes in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   -- Cuisines: French, Northern Indian.
</P>
<P>
   -- Tips: Clove is often used in dishes with long cooking times
because the heat tempers its strong, bitter flavor. Use a
clove-studded onion to flavor chicken stock.
</P>
<P>
   -- Flavor affinities: Dominates the dish, but often used in
spice mixtures, especially for long-cooking meat and poultry
dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Coriander
</P>
<P>
   These tan-brown seeds are the dried, ripe fruit of an herb. The
leaves are called cilantro. The seeds have a sweet, slightly lemony
flavor. Most come from Canada, Morocco, Romania and Egypt, with
some from China and India.
</P>
<P>
   -- Uses: In curries, chili and chutney. Seeds are often added to
potato salad, hot dogs, apple pie, poached fish and bean and pea
soups.
</P>
<P>
   -- Cuisines: Middle Eastern, Indian, Russian, North African,
Mexican.
</P>
<P>
   -- Tips: Available whole or ground; for best flavor buy whole,
and roast and grind as needed.
</P>
<P>
   -- Flavor affinities: Mint, cumin.
</P>
<P>
   Cumin
</P>
<P>
   Dried seed of an herb in the parsley family. It resembles
caraway seed but has a musty, earthy flavor that dominates the
dish. Most comes from India, Turkey, Pakistan and China.
</P>
<P>
   -- Uses: In blends, including chili powder, curry powder and
garam masala.
</P>
<P>
   -- Cuisines: Mexican, Middle Eastern, Indian, North African.
</P>
<P>
   -- Tips: Available whole or ground; dry-roast in a skillet and
grind whole seeds in a mortar just before using for best flavor.
</P>
<P>
   -- Flavor affinities: Chiles, coriander, tomatoes, beans, corn.
</P>
<P>
   Dill
</P>
<P>
   Another annual in the parsley family, dill is related to anise,
caraway, coriander, cumin and fennel. It is native to Europe and
grown in California. Seed is purchased from India or China. Chopped
feathery leaves have an anise-like flavor and are used fresh or
dried, also known as dillweed. Seeds are light brown and are sold
whole and ground.
</P>
<P>
   -- Uses: Dillweed is used in chicken, veal, salads, noodles,
sour cream, salad dressings, sauces, egg dishes and seafood. More
strongly flavored seed is used in pickles and in bread, potato and
vegetable dishes.
</P>
<P>
   -- Cuisines: Russian, Middle Eastern, Indian.
</P>
<P>
   -- Tips: Drying diminishes the flavor of dill leaves, so use
dillweed generously and add toward the end of cooking time.
</P>
<P>
   -- Flavor affinities: Pairs well with tarragon and lemon zest
for seafood dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Fennel
</P>
<P>
   Dried fruit of a perennial in parsley family. Plants harvested
by hand and dried. Seeds are greenish-gray with yellow ridges and a
warm, sweet flavor, similar to that of licorice and anise. Most
comes from India, Egypt and China, with Egyptian considered
premium.
</P>
<P>
   -- Uses: Pickling mixes. Seeds used in Italian foods, including
sausage and spaghetti sauces; fish dishes, cabbage, bread, crackers
and other bakery products. Fresh leaves used with grilled seafood.
</P>
<P>
   -- Cuisines: Italian, Chinese, Indian, German (breads), Polish
(borscht), Spanish (baked goods).
</P>
<P>
   -- Tips: Crush seeds lightly in mortar and pestle to release
their flavor; for Indian dishes, toast seeds before using.
</P>
<P>
   -- Flavor affinities: Parsley, oregano, sage, thyme and chili
powder.
</P>
<P>
   Garlic powder
</P>
<P>
   Garlic, one of the world's most popular seasonings, is available
fresh or dried, and as dehydrated flakes, powder and mixed with
salt.
</P>
<P>
   -- Uses: Adds flavor to an almost endless variety of dishes,
especially pesto, roasted meats, bread, chili, marinades and soups.
</P>
<P>
   -- Cuisines: Italian, Mediterranean, Asian, French, Mexican,
Central and South American, Indian.
</P>
<P>
   -- Tips: The taste of fresh garlic is superior to dried forms,
so it's best to resort to the latter only in a pinch (although it
can be useful in dry rubs or seasoning blends). About 1/8 teaspoon
of garlic powder is equal to an average clove of fresh garlic; 1/2
teaspoon of garlic salt equals one clove of garlic. When using
garlic salt, reduce the amount of salt added in the recipe.
</P>
<P>
   -- Flavor affinities: Curry, ginger, cilantro, chile peppers.
</P>
<P>
   Ginger
</P>
<P>
   Ginger comes from the dried rhizomes of a plant grown in India,
Jamaica and China. The rootlike rhizomes are dug, washed, boiled
and dried in the sun to produce ground ginger. The flavor is
pungent, lemony, warm and sweet.
</P>
<P>
   -- Uses: Ground _ cookies, cakes, pies, Asian stir-fries,
marinades, curries; pickled _ as a condiment with sushi;
crystallized _ (fresh ginger root cooked in syrup and dried) as
confection or condiment.
</P>
<P>
   -- Cuisines: Asian, German, North African, American.
</P>
<P>
   -- Tips: Ground is best used in baked goods; in Chinese/Asian
cooking, use only in a pinch when fresh is not available.
</P>
<P>
   -- Flavor affinities: Fresh _ citrus fruits, soy sauce, garlic
and onions; ground _ sweet dishes, rhubarb and apples.
</P>
<P>
   Mace
</P>
<P>
   From the same fruit comes two for the price of one _ mace and
nutmeg. Mace is the lacy covering of the nutlike seed, which is
nutmeg. It's orange, with a sweet, warm, spicy flavor.
</P>
<P>
   -- Uses: That distinctive flavor of many doughnuts comes from
mace. Also used in cakes, cookies, fruit dishes and chocolate
desserts. Can be added to spinach, carrots and creamed chicken.
</P>
<P>
   -- Cuisines: Originally from Indonesia, used in many
international cuisines.
</P>
<P>
   -- Tips: Comes whole and ground; store in jars in a cool, dark
place.
</P>
<P>
   -- Flavor affinities: Cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, ginger,
pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Marjoram
</P>
<P>
   A member of the mint family, but with a taste similar to that of
oregano. It has a distinctly aromatic green and pleasant woody
flavor, with a slightly bitter undertone.The majority of marjoram
comes from the Nile Valley in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   -- Uses: Complements the flavor of chicken, turkey stuffing,
vegetable and bean soups and tomato sauces. Can be used in many
meat dishes; good with tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   -- Cuisines: Middle Eastern, French, Italian, Greek.
</P>
<P>
   -- Tips: Available in both leaf and ground forms. It should be
used sparingly at first, until you've adjusted to the taste.
</P>
<P>
   -- Flavor affinities: Oregano, rosemary, basil, parsley.
</P>
<P>
   Mint
</P>
<P>
   Spearmint is most often used in cooking and peppermint in
desserts among the more than 600 known varieties of this perennial
found throughout the world. Most often leaves are used fresh, but
dried leaves can deliver a strong, sweet and tangy flavor, with a
cool aftertaste.
</P>
<P>
   -- Uses: Mint jelly with lamb, salad dressings, fish and fruit
sauces, flavored teas, chocolate desserts, sprinkled on peas, in
marinades and tabbouleh.
</P>
<P>
   -- Cuisines: Tunisian, Turkish, Middle Eastern, Indian, Thai and
Greek.
</P>
<P>
   -- Tips: Stir dried leaves into warm apple jelly for an easy
meat sauce.
</P>
<P>
   -- Flavor affinities: Lamb, ham, carrots, potatoes, cucumbers,
tomatoes and yogurt. Although included in a few bouquets garni,
mint generally does not combine well with other spices or with
garlic, explaining its absence from French and Italian cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Mustard
</P>
<P>
   Mustard has a clean, fresh aroma with a pungent, biting flavor.
There are two main types of seeds _ yellow and brown. Yellow is
most commonly used for whole and ground spice, brown in the
preparation of hot mustards. Less common but very important to
Indian cuisine are black mustard seeds.
</P>
<P>
   -- Uses: Ground mustard enhances meat, fish, poultry, sauces,
salad dressings, cheese and egg dishes. The whole seed is often
used for pickling, boiled with beets, cabbage or sauerkraut and as
a garnish for salads.
</P>
<P>
   -- Cuisines: American, Cajun, French, English, German and
Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   -- Tips: Ground mustard has no aroma when dry. It must be
moistened for about 10 minutes for it to develop its sharp, hot,
tangy flavor.
</P>
<P>
   -- Flavor affinities: Tarragon, vinegar, honey, lemon,
horseradish.
</P>
<P>
   Nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   This nutlike seed combines piney and citruslike flavors with
sweet and bitter tastes for a very distinctive flavor stronger than
its partner, mace.
</P>
<P>
   -- Uses: Most commonly used in flavoring sweet foods such as
puddings, cakes and cookies. Also used in sausage and sprinkled
atop eggnog. Used sparingly as an accent note in bechamel sauce and
creamed vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   -- Cuisines: American, many European cuisines, Indian.
</P>
<P>
   -- Tips: It's available in both whole and ground forms. If you
use whole, grate it and add toward the end of cooking because heat
diminishes the flavor.
</P>
<P>
   -- Flavor affinities: Cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, ginger,
pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Oregano
</P>
<P>
   There are two main kinds of oregano _ the Mediterranean and
Mexican varieties. The Mediterranean variety is slightly bitter and
minty, while the Mexican variety is more potent and used primarily
in chili powder.
</P>
<P>
   -- Uses: Primarily in pasta sauces and pizza. It's also a
frequent seasoning for vegetables, meat, fish, bean dishes, garden
salads, egg dishes and quick breads.
</P>
<P>
   -- Cuisines: Italian, Greek, Mexican.
</P>
<P>
   -- Tips: Add early to long-simmering stews.
</P>
<P>
   -- Flavor affinities: Rosemary, thyme, basil, vinegars.
</P>
<P>
   Paprika
</P>
<P>
   The dried, ground pod of a sweet pepper, paprika is mildly
flavored and prized for its brilliant red color. Many European
varieties are sweet; Hungarian paprika is hotter because ground red
pepper is often added.
</P>
<P>
   -- Uses: As a colorful garnish for light-colored foods such as
fish, potatoes, eggs and cheese dishes. It's the principal
seasoning in Hungarian goulash and often used in French dressing.
</P>
<P>
   -- Cuisines: Eastern European, Spanish, other European.
</P>
<P>
   -- Tips: Always sold in ground forms. To retain its color,
paprika should be kept in the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>

   These slender, slightly curved leaves resemble pine needles and
have a distinctive fresh, sweet, piney aroma and flavor.
</P>
<P>
   -- Uses: Lamb, pork, potatoes, carrots, stews, marinades, fish,
poultry and bread.
</P>
<P>
   -- Cuisines: Many European and Mediterranean cuisines.

leaf.
</P>
<P>
   Savory
</P>
<P>
   A flavor that's a cross between thyme and mint, with summer
savory slightly milder than winter savory. The slightly peppery,
minty and medicinal flavor blends well with other herbs.

mild and earthy.
</P>
<P>
   -- Uses: In curry powder and other spice blends; also in
pickles, relishes, prepared mustard, deviled eggs, pilafs, poultry,
fish, cauliflower, potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   -- Cuisines: Chinese, Middle Eastern, Indian.
</P>
<P>
   -- Tips: Turmeric can be used as an economical substitute for
saffron to color dishes, though the flavor will be milder and
muskier.
</P>
<P>
   -- Flavor affinities: Often mixed into curry blends with ginger,
fenugreek, cloves, cinnamon, cumin, black and red peppers.
</P>
<P>
   White pepper
</P>
<P>
   Like black pepper, white pepper is hot and biting, but it has an
earthier flavor. Both come from the same plant, but white pepper
has the pungent skin milled off.
</P>
<P>
   -- Uses: Especially good on light-colored foods such as fish,
chicken and potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   -- Cuisines: European, especially French and Italian.
</P>
<P>
   -- Tips: Best for using early in the cooking process. The ideal
storage is a pepper mill that's sealed tightly and has a strong
metal grinding apparatus.
</P>
<P>
   -- Flavor affinities: Garlic, ginger.

 &HT;    A walk on the culinary wild side
 &HT;    By John Kessler
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ajowan. Annatto. Asafoetida. Have some of these spices made it
into your pantry?
</P>
<P>
   You may want to throw up your hands in dismay and say, ``It's
all fenugreek to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't. Here are a dozen exotic flavorings that are gaining a
foothold on American spice shelves:
</P>
<P>
   -- Ajowan: This relative of cumin hasn't yet gained much favor
outside India. But that's changing as chefs discover its intriguing
flavor, which is often described as similar to thyme but more
pungent. In India, it's used in breads, pastries, pickles and the
ubiquitous snack mixes. The seeds look just like celery seeds.
</P>
<P>
   -- Annatto seeds: These hard red seeds, which grow throughout
Central America, give food a subtle, haunting flavor and an
orangy-yellow tinge. (Annatto is the coloring used in margarine and
cheese.) The seeds, available at Mexican grocery stores, can be
stale and difficult to extract flavor from. Much better is the
annatto paste called achiote, which makes a great marinade for
grilled seafood and is essential to Yucatan-style cookery.
</P>
<P>
   -- Asafoetida: This stuff stinks _ literally. A powdered resin
derived from a giant fennel plant, asafoetida is used in minute
quantities in Indian cooking, particularly vegetables and legumes,
to give a deep bass note and resonance to the flavors. Luckily, the
stench disappears when cooking. If you ever use it, make sure you
have a well-sealed container.
</P>
<P>
   -- Fenugreek: Used extensively in Iranian and Indian cooking,
fenugreek has a sharp, spicy and sometimes bitter flavor. The seeds
come whole, crushed and ground, while the leaves _ called ``methi''
in Indian stores _ are available dried. It's an essential
ingredient in curry blends and in the classic Persian beef stew
with herbs called ``ghorme sabzi.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Juniper berries: These fat, purplish berries of an evergreen
tree have a strong resiny, piney flavor. They've long been used in
Europe for game cookery, where their pungency stands up to wild
venison and boar. Juniper also flavors gin and figures in most
pickling spice blends.
</P>
<P>
   -- Lavender: Both the seeds and the dried leaves of this common
garden herb are available commercially. Lavender figures in herbes
de Provence, the southern French herb blend that's so good on
roasted meats. Chefs like to use lavender in spice rubs because the
floral flavor is distinctive but not too harsh.
</P>
<P>
   -- New Mexican red chile powder: Made from pulverized ripe chile
pods, this is essentially a kind of paprika. In the West, where red
chile powder is commonly available, home cooks tend to blend their
own chili powder _ the spice mix for chili con carne and taco
filling.
</P>
<P>
   -- Pink peppercorns: Unlike the green, white and black
varieties, these are not true peppercorns but rather the dried
fruit of a South American tree. They're, well, pretty.
</P>
<P>
   -- Saffron: This familiar but still exotic flavoring _
hand-harvested from the stigmas of crocus flowers _ deserves its
reputation as the world's most expensive spice. A quarter-million
flowers yield only one pound of spice. Fortunately, little is
needed to impart its pungent flavor and pronounced golden color.
Even though packages of saffron may bear a Spanish label, it was
probably harvested in Iran and repackaged in Spain. Choose saffron
threads rather than ground saffron. For maximum color saturation,
soak the threads in a little warm water to make a potent saffron
tea.
</P>
<P>
   -- Sumac: From Turkey to Iran, cooks use the ground seeds of
purple sumac (a harmless relative of green ``poison'' sumac) to add
a refreshing, tart piquancy to food. It marries beautifully with
yogurt sauces as well as grilled meats, and is often served on the
table as a condiment.
</P>
<P>
   -- Sichuan peppercorns: These dried berries leave a mildly
spicy, tingly feeling in the mouth. Despite the name, they are more
intriguing, subtle and aromatic than full-throttle hot.
</P>
<P>
   -- Star anise: Chefs are beginning to cotton to the warm, soft,
sweet flavor of this spice native to China, and it has become a
crossover star in American restaurants. It is used throughout China
and Vietnam, particularly in long-simmered dishes. The flavor
nicely balances fatty meats such as pork and duck, but also plays
well in desserts. It is one of the ingredients of Chinese
five-spice powder, along with Sichuan pepper, cassia (coarse
cinnamon), fennel seed and clove. The star-shaped pods, which are
really the flowers of a small evergreen, are available whole or
powdered.

WHERE BROADCAST CALL LETTERS CAME FROM 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also CIR-HDTV-CHANNELS)  
(lb) 
 By ERIC A. TAUB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The United States' broadcasters use their call
letters like vanity license plates. Call letters, a 19th-century
invention, are still a quick way to give viewers a sense of the
station's persona.
</P>
<P>
   Call letters were originally created so telegraph operators
could send messages to ships and other parties without having to
spell out the entire name of the recipient with every
communication. With the advent of radio, they became an easy way to
carve out a station's identity.
</P>
<P>
   The international assignment of call letters was codified in
1912 at the London International Radiotelegraphic Conference.
German channels would begin with A or D (for Deutschland) or use
KAA to KCZ. British stations would start with a B or M, while
French channels would use the letter F.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently asleep at the wheel, the United States received the
meaningless letters KDA to KZZ, as well as N (used for Navy and
Coast Guard stations), and W. In 1929, it received the rest of the
K combinations, which had originally been allocated to Germany.
</P>
<P>
   With their historically small number of local television and
radio stations, few nations outside the United States, Canada and
Mexico bother using their assigned call letters, identifying their
stations by name only, like France's TF1, Germany's ARD, or
Britain's BBC1, BBC2 and London Weekend Television.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, radio call signs were initially three
letters, assigned in order on a first-come, first-served basis. By
the early 1920s, three-letter codes had begun to run out, so the
government switched to four-letter signs.
</P>
<P>
   A station's call sign begins with a W if it is east of the
Mississippi River and with K if it is west of there. The 30 or so
stations named before this rule, like KDKA and KYW in Philadelphia,
and WHO in Des Moines, were allowed to keep their call signs.
</P>
<P>
   Until December 1983, the Federal Communications Commission
controlled call-letter assignments. Call signs, which could now be
requested, nevertheless had to be in good taste, the regulations
said, and ``sufficiently dissimilar phonetically and rhythmically
from existing call signs of stations in the same service area so
that there will be no significant likelihood of public confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulations originally prohibited a station from using
the initials of any living president or of the United States or its
agencies or departments.
</P>
<P>
   By 1984, the FCC got out of the station-identification
censorship business. Stations could now call themselves KFBI
(Wichita, Kan.) or WJFK (Washington) if they wished. Matters of
taste would be handled by the courts, not the federal government.
For a number of years, one station in the West used as its call
letters a four-letter profanity spelled backward).
</P>
<P>
   Still, call signs technically remain the property of the
government, preventing a secondary market in call-sign trading from
developing. But once a station knows that another station is about
to relinquish a call sign it covets, it can arrange to be tipped
off so it can file an application for the sign just moments after
it is turned in.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 1922, stations could request specific call letters.
The first custom combination went to the Detroit Police Department,
which named its station KOP.
</P>
<P>
   Whether a station's call letters or its meaning came first is
often open to debate, and a host of amateur call-letter historians
have sprung up to chronicle all the permutations; comprehensive
listings of call-letter meanings and origins are provided at
www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/6375/origins.html and at
www.ipass.net/whitetho/recap.htm.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, WABD (Channel 5) was named after a television
network pioneer, Allen B. DuMont. The station's call letters were
later changed to WNEW and then WNYW. WOR's initials stood for
Wonders (or World) of Radio, while the Big Three networks
capitalized on their own initials in naming their local outlets
WABC, WCBS and WNBC.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, KNX Radio was named that because its office was
in the annex next to the studio's original home. KHJ (now KRTH)
stood for Kindness, Hope, and Joy, the names of three canaries
whose chirping was used on radio broadcasts, while KTTV, once owned
by The Los Angeles Times, stood for Times Television.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, an Arlington Heights, Ill., station used the call
letters WSEX to attract attention, according to a broadcast
engineering consultant and amateur call-letter historian, Barry
Mishkind, of Phoenix. New York's WEVD got its name from the
socialist Eugene V. Debs, while Buffalo's WKBW picked up its
moniker from its evangelical owner, Clinton Churchill, who liked
the idea of an acronym for Well-Known Bible Witness.
</P>
<P>
   In Cicero, Ill., the letters of WVON, the AM station, stood for
Voice of the Negro, according to Bob Nelson, the lead software
developer of On Air USA and another call-sign historian who lives
in Dallas and runs the Geocities site listed above. The station was
bought by the Harlem Globetrotters' organization and moved to
Chicago and renamed WGCI for Globetrotter Communications.
Similarly, WNOV in Wisconsin stands for Wisconsin's Negroes' Own
Voice.
</P>
<P>
   WLBB Radio in Carrollton, Ga., was so named because the original
owner agreed that ``we love butter beans.'' KFWB in Los Angeles was
named after its original owners, the Four Warner Brothers. Its
slogan, Keep Filming Warner Brothers, was modified during World War
II to Keep Fighting, Warner Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   WTRC (Truth Radio Co.) in Elkhart, Ind., metamorphosed into WTFF
of Virginia, owned by the publisher of The Fellowship Forum, a Ku
Klux Klan publication. The station was sold and its call letters
changed in 1943 to WTOP in Washington (at 1500kHz, the top of the
dial), Mishkind said.
</P>
<P>
   Other unusual call signs include KSBW (Salad Bowl of the World)
in Salinas, Calif.; WTTW-TV (Windows to the World) in Chicago; WZPR
(the home of the inventor of the zipper) in Meadville, Pa., and
KSHE in St. Louis, which once had an all-female staff.

 &HT;    Do yourself a flavor: Care for spices
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You spend more time rummaging through a cupboard crowded with
glass bottles and tiny metal cans than you do cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Finally you spy the allspice lurking behind the sugar sprinkles
from three Easters ago, and wonder just how long it's been there
and whether it still will taste like spice at all.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to reorganize your spices.
</P>
<P>
   -- Weeding: First, see what's worth keeping. Although an old
spice isn't necessarily a useless spice, it may have lost color,
aroma and flavor _ all the attributes that attracted you in the
first place. Experts at Spice Islands say you should look to see if
the color has faded. Red spices, like paprika, turn brown with age.
Then crush or rub some in your hand and smell (be careful with
ground red pepper). If it doesn't produce a rich, immediate aroma,
it may be time to replace it. Finally, taste a bit. Is there
anything there?
</P>
<P>
   -- Storing: Experts at spice companies tell consumers to keep
tightly closed containers away from heat, bright light, moisture
and oxygen. That rules out the most common spot _ on a shelf above
the stove _ and limits placement near refrigerators, dishwashers,
sinks, windows and often-used coffeepots.
</P>
<P>
   They generally advise against freezing, noting that removing the
containers frequently can cause ruinous condensation. The exception
is oil-rich seeds, such as poppy seeds and sesame, which can become
rancid.
</P>
<P>
   Red spices, however, such as paprika, chili powder and cayenne,
should be refrigerated to prevent loss of color and flavor and to
guard against infestation.
</P>
<P>
   Look for the coolest spot in the kitchen. Products are available
to help organize the bottles and cans in cabinets, drawers and even
under cabinets.
</P>
<P>
   -- Keeping: Generally, whole spices last four years, seeds three
to four years and ground spices and green leafy herbs one to three
years. Seasoning blends and products containing fat, lemon, wine
and oil-rich seeds have shorter shelf lives.
</P>
<P>
   -- Using: The way you use spices can extend shelf life.
</P>
<P>
   The taste of some older ones, including cumin, coriander,
mustard seeds, fennel seeds, poppy seeds and sesame seeds, will
benefit by toasting or dry roasting. Put the spices in a heavy
skillet that has been heated over medium heat. Toast two to five
minutes, stirring constantly.
</P>
<P>
   Grind whole spices in a small food processor, coffee grinder,
pepper mill or mortar and pestle. (Be careful with allspice and
cloves, which contain an oil that can damage plastic parts.) To
clean the grinder, add a small amount of salt or sugar and process.
</P>
<P>
   Measure spices with a dry spoon and recap tightly after use.
Never shake directly into a steaming pot; the moisture will cause
caking.
</P>
<P>
   Crush leaf herbs lightly before adding.
</P>
<P>
   Add dried leaves at the beginning of cooking for blended flavors
or toward the end of cooking for more pronounced flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Ground spices and herbs should be added toward the end of
cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Whole spices and bay leaves should be added at the beginning of
cooking. Tie them in cheesecloth for easy removal.
</P>
<P>
   Flavors in uncooked foods, such as salad dressings and
marinades, need time or brief heating to blend.
</P>
<P>
   -- Buying: After reorganizing, buy the smallest available
container of a ground spice or dried herb. Whole herbs and spices
last far longer than the ground variety, so consider buying whole
and grinding for each use.
</P>
<P>
   If the recipe calls for something you know will get stuck in the
back of the cabinet, unnoticed and unneeded for years, consider
going in with a friend or two to buy, divide and conquer the
cabinet clutter.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Clearing a path to family roots and a garden
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL SEPTEMBER 10: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been years since I had a vegetable garden. A woman living
alone doesn't require bountiful fruits of the earth very often, and
I have had the benefits of great gardening friends.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the best, James Bagwell and Charles Buggs, are the
authors of the occasional basket of tomatoes or fat and fine
watermelon, the emerald green beans and the golden squash that
mysteriously show up on my back porch. They have made me almost
content that the tiller that I bought in a splurge of ill-timed
ambition was borrowed and not returned.
</P>
<P>
   But I confess that it went against my raising to have a patch of
unplanted, untended earth. My mother firmly believed that to own
land and not plant a garden was a sin against God and man. It was a
matter of satisfaction to all of us that even our poorest neighbors
managed to eat pretty well, and when there was a Sunday school
picnic or an all-day sing with dinner on the ground, they were able
to contribute handsomely. They may not have heard of some of the
vegetables that city people value _ I remember when I first met
broccoli and asparagus in Atlanta _ but they had collard greens and
sweet potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   It just seemed impractical to me, when left alone, to try to
carry on the enterprise we started at Sweet Apple the day we were
picnicking up there _ before the cabin was habitable _ when our
nearest neighbor, Clarence Johnson, walked down the road and
offered to plow us a garden spot. We hadn't thought that far, but
we were thrilled at the prospect and grabbed his offer. Sometime
later, after truckloads of stable manure and chicken litter, we
joined the rich caravan of people who know how to live off the
land.
</P>
<P>
   Our tomatoes were magnificent. Our Silver Queen corn glorious.
We had rows of okra, which outdid anything at the grocery store
because you could harvest your own pods when they were an inch
long, rush to the kitchen with them and serve them boiled whole
with lemon juice and butter _ something impossible with the big,
tough, store-bought kind.
</P>
<P>
   Tilling the vegetable garden alone just seemed impossible to me,
especially when a tree blew down across half of it and big mulberry
trees moved into the other half. Weeds and wildly flourishing
bushes took over, and I stopped going to my garden.
</P>
<P>
   But the other day I lucked into a new friend, the daughter of an
old-time Sweet Apple family. She arrived in her red pickup, towing
a riding mower, and asked if I wanted my yard cut. Since our newest
Snapper Comet had suffered a cracked engine, I waved her in and
accepted her services. On her next visit, she hit the vegetable
garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look!'' I cried when I saw it, ``my garden's back!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yep,'' said D. Hayden complacently. ``Now if we can get it
plowed!''
</P>
<P>
   I went out to look. We have to cut down the invading mulberries,
but the space around them is open and clear. She protected the
garlic chives, darling diminutive plants now in full bloom. She
looked over the apple trees and made a date with them for pruning
and spraying next February.
</P>
<P>
   When she left, I went back and paced off the little spot. A
cardinal set up shop in the wild cherry tree and sang a welcome. I
know it's late for many things. I missed the deadline for turnip
and mustard greens. But there's bound to be something. I'll go to
Chadwick's store and get counsel from the experts, who gather there
around the harness counter and the seed racks early in the morning.

 &HT;    A site worth crowing about
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We are here today to honor chicken. Coq au vin, cacciatore,
Kiev, arroz con pollo, curried chicken, five-spice chicken, chicken
Marengo, chicken a la King, deviled chicken, chicken chow mein,
chicken salad, chicken cutlets, chicken pot pie, fried chicken,
chicken wings, chicken nuggets and, let's not forget, chicken soup.
</P>
<P>
   With no religious or cultural restraints on its consumption,
chicken is part of the diet of almost every nation on Earth. If
there were no other meat available, you conceivably could eat
chicken every day for five years, maybe more, and never repeat a
recipe.
</P>
<P>
   To honor the ubiquitous bird, the National Broiler Council has
designated September National Chicken Month, and its World Wide Web
site is a good all-around place to properly pay homage to this
glorious fowl. At http://www.eatchicken.com you can:
</P>
<P>
   -- Become part of the 43rd national chicken cooking contest,
with a grand prize of $25,000. The deadline for entry is Oct. 15;
the finals are in May in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   -- Check out 43 years of first-prize recipes.
</P>
<P>
   -- Use the extremely useful ``ultimate chicken recipe
database.'' Say you've got some chicken in the freezer, leftover
chicken in the fridge or fresh chicken from the market. Fill in a
key word or ingredient you want to use, check off the part or parts
you have, select a particular cuisine (Southern, Southwestern,
Asian, Cajun, Caribbean, Italian or Middle Eastern) and, finally,
select a preparation method, from bake to stir-fry. Press
``search'' and _ voila! _ get a chicken recipe to suit your
immediate needs. We randomly punched in some specifications and
came up with the 1964 national finalist recipe for World's Fair
Chicken (right).
</P>
<P>
   -- See how some internationally celebrated chefs do chicken, or
how it's served at places such as the Ritz-Carlton in Chicago, 82
Queen in Charleston, S.C., Kaspar's in Seattle and the Vidalia in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   -- Check out the results of the national chicken salad survey,
which garnered some surprisingly varied recipes for chicken salad
from participants.
</P>
<P>
   Want more? Visit http://www.mymenus.com, type ``chicken'' in the
search box and view hundreds of chicken recipes, sorted
alphabetically or by preparation time, cooking time, total time,
calories, fat, percentage of calories from fat, cholesterol,
carbohydrates, fiber or sodium.
</P>
<P>
   Still not enough? For hundreds more recipes, check out
http://www.ebicom.net/kitchen/page/poultidx.htm.
</P>
<P>
   And, by all means, have a happy National Chicken Month.

 &HT;    Oatmeal, dried fruit take cake for Bisquick fans
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kathy Attaway of Augusta, Georgia remembers an apricot-oatmeal
bread her mother made using Bisquick, but she can't find the
recipe.
</P>
<P>
   Neither could other readers, but that didn't stop plenty of them
from responding with the closest thing they could find. From most,
that was a recipe for Banana-Apricot Nut Bread from a Bisquick
book. After all, they said, Attaway could easily substitute some
oats for some of the biscuit mix.
</P>
<P>
   Just as we tested the recipe, Betty Butler of Cartersville, Ga.
sent another that seemed to meet more of the requirements _ it had
nuts, oatmeal and biscuit mix _ and substituting its dates with
apricots might work well. We tested it, too.
</P>
<P>
   Both are good served warm with plenty of butter, cream cheese or
apple butter.

 &HT;    Pinch of variety adds verve to dishes
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Spice is the variety of a cook's life, adding heat to a pot of
soup on a winter afternoon or a bitter chill to a glass of iced tea
on a sweltering summer evening.
</P>
<P>
   We gathered these recipes calling for a variety of spices and
dried herbs to help you use what you may already have in your
kitchen cabinets in new ways and to inspire you to add a lot more
flavor.
</P>

   After all, you may have okra, and you may have curry powder, but
how many of us have had Curried Okra?

   Do not skip the step of caramelizing some of the onion, which
adds a necessary layer of sweetness to this unusual dish.
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon curry masala (see note)
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon white vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2tablespoons cooking oil
</P>
<P>
   1large onion, peeled and chopped, divided
</P>
<P>
   1pound small, whole okra pods
</P>
<P>
   1cup stock
</P>
<P>
   Rice or Indian bread (naan)
</P>
<P>
   Note: To make the curry masala, mix 4 parts ground coriander; 2
parts each cumin, garlic powder, fenugreek (or curry powder) and
turmeric; 1 part cardamom; 1/2 part each salt and cayenne.
</P>
<P>
   Mix 1 tablespoon curry masala and 1 tablespoon vinegar and set
aside. Save the remaining masala for another use.
</P>
<P>
   In a large saucepan over medium heat, warm the oil. Add half the
onion and cook until it begins to caramelize, about 7 to 10
minutes. Add the curry-vinegar mixture and stir for 1 minute. Add
the remaining onion and cook until it turns translucent, about 3
minutes. Add the okra and cook about 5 minutes. Add the stock,
blending everything well. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Serve over basmati rice or with Indian bread, such as naan. _

   One and a half teaspoons of nutmeg may sound like a lot if you
are accustomed to pinches here and there. But in this cake, a
favorite from Wayside Inn in Middletown, Va., it is crucial. If the
nutmeg on your shelf has been there longer than you can remember,
use even more or treat yourself to a new batch.

 &HT;    Alfani shows affordable, classic looks with a twist
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL SEPTEMBER 13: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new clothing line for women who would rather spend their
paychecks on manicures than big-time designer labels is in stores
now.
</P>
<P>
   Alfani for Women is a collection of career dresses and
sportswear separates retailing from $39 for a rayon T-shirt to $169
for a wool boucle jacket. Sizes range from 4 to 16. Made in Italy
and Asia, the label's clothes are modeled by actress Isabella
Rossellini.
</P>
<P>
   The line is a brand developed by Federated Department Stores and
found exclusively in a number of their stores. Since the stores'
buyers and designer deal directly with the factories, there's no
middleman and the savings are passed on to the customer. Judging by
its location in the stores, the Alfani collection is clearly geared
to women who appreciate such labels as Liz Claiborne, Jones New
York and Evan Picone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to call these refined yet modern clothes,'' says the
New York designer Michael Leva, who in the past has done women's
collections under his own name. ``They are not trendy _ no sheer
skirts or blouses. But there are lots of comfortable clothes in
beautiful fabrics.'' Classic items are often designed with a twist.
For example, a striped shirt ($45) is cut on the bias while a
simple cardigan sweater ($79) features chenille trim.
</P>
<P>
   Shopper Nicole LeBlanc was attracted to the collection by its
affordable prices and fabrics. Her purchases? A short brown wool
skirt and a gray/white/black striped shirt that she plans to wear
with black or gray trousers.
</P>
<P>
   The fall collection, done in tones of gray, black, ivory and
camel, focuses on knit dressing: sleeveless dresses with cardigan
coats or short jackets; classic blazers, sleeveless shells and slim
trousers; short and long skirts _ slim, wrapped or cut on the bias.
Pinstripe and solid woolens, tweeds, velvets and synthetic blends
also appear in the line. Stretch yarns are added to much of the
clothing to ensure a snug yet comfortable fit.
</P>
<P>
   Spicing up these items are silk or cotton blouses, metallic
striped pullovers and twin sets in wine, deep green, pink and
silver.
</P>
<P>
   The store will receive Alfani merchandise each month. And new
colors will coordinate with those a customer might already own.
</P>
<P>
   Designer Leva is already working on colors for fall '99 and
spring 2000. His predictions? Gray will continue both in light and
dark shades as well as whites and
</P>
<P>
   pastels.

 &HT;    Thumbs up for falling hemlines as skirts dip below the knee
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL SEPTEMBER 13: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget the mini.
</P>
<P>
   Hemlines will take a dive this season as designers go to great
lengths to offer women longer skirts _ from below the knee to right
above the ankle. Knits, woolens, crepes and acrylic blends are
popular in classic colors: black, gray, winter white and navy.
Styles range from classic trouser skirts to wraps to simple
A-lines; hemlines stop from below the knee to above the ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``For decency's sake, longer is better,'' says Gae Marino, a New
York trend tracker. ``A longer skirt can be just as comfy as
trousers, only it looks more feminine, whether you pair it with a
chunky-heeled boot or pancake flat.''
</P>
<P>
   Other footwear options include fabric ankle boots or shiny
loafers with 1-inch heels. Flats are the newest footwear to wear
with longer hemlines, but the right pair of high heels can make a
long skirt look sexy.
</P>
<P>
   To show off the latest in hemlines, we asked four women to model
a longer black skirt. Black is a classic shade that can be dressed
up or down and goes with all other colors.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Atlanta wardrobe consultant Linda Bigger has the best
reason to choose a black skirt. ``Regardless of a woman's size, a
black skirt offers the optical illusion of slimness and
sleekness,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   TALL AND TRIM
</P>
<P>
   -- Name: Paula Smith, 41
</P>
<P>
   -- Occupation: Flight attendant with Delta Air Lines
</P>
<P>
   -- Height: 6 feet
</P>
<P>
   -- Skirt style: With perfect proportions _ long legs, small
waist and hips _ any type of longer-length skirt looks good on
Paula, says Meg Ferguson, with Nordstrom's fashion office in
Atlanta. For Smith's outfit, Ferguson selected a 100 percent wool
knit by Classiques Entier ($118) that ends just above the ankle.
``This new length is flattering to tall, long-legged women,'' she
says. ``It gives her an unbroken line of color from waist to
shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   To give the skirt a dressed-up look, Ferguson added a Dana
Buchman wine-colored silk embroidered vest ($198). Other top
options for Smith might include a long jacket or a sweater set.
</P>
<P>
   -- Accessories: Ferguson added black stockings and shiny black
elastic flats by Paul Green ($170). Our model could also have worn
a black high-heeled boot or shoe to emphasize her height. The
midsize microfiber handbag by Paloma Picasso ($95) adds texture to
this ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   -- Verdict: ``I love the new skirts,'' says Smith. ``Finally, I
can find one that's long enough!''
</P>
<P>
   SOPHISTICATED PETITE
</P>
<P>
   -- Name: Jane Jenkins, 56
</P>
<P>
   -- Occupation: Program manager with Atlanta Arrangements
</P>
<P>
   -- Height: 5 feet 3 inches
</P>
<P>
   -- Skirt style: ``Since Jane is a petite, I wanted to create an
illusion of height,'' says Jeanne Ward, an assistant manager with
Talbots/Talbots Petites. ``I did this by using one continuous color
from head to toe.'' Jenkins' button-front flannel skirt ($98) falls
right below midcalf, a length that gives the illusion of height.
And the buttons draw the eye to the body's natural vertical line. A
black mock turtleneck ($38) under a plum short sleeve silk cable
pullover ($68) and matching cardigan ($98) continue the heightening
effect. ``Jane should avoid oversize, boxy clothes,'' says Ward.
``They overwhelm a petite frame.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Accessories: Black stockings and a faux crocodile flat with
chunky heel ($88) keep the monochromatic look. For more height,
Jenkins could wear a shoe with a 1-or-2-inch heel. Other touches:
small dangle, mixed-metal earrings ($36) to draw the eye upward; a
narrow belt ($38) to show off Jenkins' trim waistline and a small
bag with a long strap to elongate the torso ($98).
</P>
<P>
   -- Verdict: ``Whatever makes me look taller and thinner, I
love,'' says Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   SCALED-DOWN CHIC
</P>
<P>
   -- Name: Patti Collins, 50
</P>
<P>
   -- Occupation: Executive recruiter with the Collins Group
</P>
<P>
   -- Height: 5 feet 4 inches
</P>
<P>
   -- Skirt style: Patti can normally slip into skirts right off
the rack, says Debbie Chelko, a sales associate at Tootsies.
``Although she has short legs, Patti is well-proportioned, with a
small waist and hips. A longer skirt with a short top will give her
the illusion of length.'' Collins slipped into Laundry's
rayon/Lycra blend skirt with a back slit ($130). It fit perfectly,
stopping right above the ankle. The waist-length, patterned knit
Kenzo jacket with faux fur trim ($655) also gave the illusion of
longer legs.
</P>
<P>
   -- Accessories: A lace-up leather boot with 2-inch heel ($275)
by Joan &AMP; David at Tootsies helps Collins put the right fashion
foot forward _ by giving her more height; a trim shoulder bag
($115) and Accente's small gold earrings with oval iolite stones
($75) don't overwhelm the outfit.
</P>
<P>
   -- Verdict: ``The long skirt is fun with boots,'' says Collins.
Her fiance, Joel Koenig, agrees. ``Long skirts can be sexy,
especially with a slit.''
</P>
<P>
   STATUESQUE AND STYLISH
</P>
<P>
   -- Name: LaToya Stewart, 21
</P>
<P>
   -- Occupation: Medical assistant
</P>
<P>
   -- Height: 5 feet 10 1/2 inches
</P>
<P>
   -- Skirt style: Longer skirts were made for tall women like
LaToya. Tammy Hibel, the manager of Lane Bryant at an Atlanta mall,
chose a rayon/polyester skirt with front slit and elastic waist
($39) by designs &AMP; co's easy-fit. The silky fabric is not
constricting _ it simply drapes softly over the body. To camouflage
Stewart's hip area, Hibel had her wear a long gold acrylic/nylon
knit tunic ($59) that gently skims the body.
</P>
<P>
   -- Accessories: Gold hoop earrings ($14) call attention to
LaToya's face, and a large shoulder bag ($38) is the right
proportion for her height. To continue the dark, slimming line,
footwear might be a pair of ankle-high boots for casual wear; or,
for a dressier look, a pair of Sam &AMP; Libby's stretch faille pumps
with 3-inch heel ($49).
</P>
<P>
   -- Verdict: ``What a classy look,'' says Stewart. ``And it fits
my style, which is a little on the conservative side.''

 &HT;    C-SPAN 2 plans literary topics all weekend
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're fortunate enough to get C-SPAN 2, you'll now get up to
48 hours of book coverage every weekend. Beginning at 8 a.m. ET,
Saturday, C-SPAN Chairman Brian Lamb will launch ``Book TV,''
featuring nonfiction authors discussing recently published
biographies and historical works. In addition, ``Book TV'' will
offer tours of unique bookstores and libraries, drop in on book
discussion groups and report from book fairs around the country.
``On Oct. 10 and 11, we'll be live at Nashville's Southern Festival
of Books,'' Lamb says. ``We'll try to do one (fair) a month
somewhere in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Book TV'' also will cover historical fiction and nonfiction
for children and young adults, provide an inside look at the
business of publishing and bookselling and host live call-in forums
discussing industry trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another thing we are interested in doing is reviewing classic
books,'' says Lamb, who hosts ``Book Notes'' on C-SPAN. ``You walk
into any library or bookstore and you'll find books on the shelves
that are paperbacks that have sat there for years and that are
better than the best sellers. We hope to identify them and, if the
author is still alive, do an interview. One example is (University
of Georgia professor) William McFeeley's biography of U.S. Grant.
I'd like to sit down with him and talk about that book.''
</P>
<P>
   Highlights of this weekend's schedule include interviews with
Regnery Publishing Group President Alfred Regnery (9 a.m. EDT,
Saturday) and Gary Kinder, author of ``Ship of Gold Beneath the
Deep Blue Sea'' (11 p.m. EDT, Saturday), and a tour of the Library
of Congress (1-6 p.m. EDT, Sunday).
</P>
<P>
   Coming soon on the Web, www.booktv.org will offer viewers a
schedule of upcoming ``Book TV'' programs, best-selling book lists,
first chapters of selected books and links to other book-related
sites.
</P>
<P>
   MOONLIGHT AND MAGNOLIAS: When Dahlonega writer Deborah Smith
moved from romance novels to mainstream fiction a couple of years
ago, she faced a problem of perception. No matter how few bodices
were ripped, she was still labeled a romance writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, how do you get the Anne Rivers Siddons
readers to pick up your novel without alienating the hard-core
romance readers?'' says Smith, whose latest novel is ``When Venus
Fell'' (Bantam, $23.95). Like her previous best seller, ``A Place
to Call Home'' ($23.95), the new novel deals with a conflict
between Southern families: One is pioneer, patriotic stock; the
other is Asian-American and Communist.
</P>
<P>
   So how are Smith's mainstream novels different from her
romances? ``It's the difference between a situation comedy and a
feature film. The sitcom treats the characters in a lighthearted
way.''
</P>
<P>
   But Smith is not abandoning her romance audience. She will be
one of the featured authors at the Georgia Romance Writers'
Moonlight and Magnolias Conference this weekend in Atlanta. The
conference is sold out. A portion of the proceeds will go to
literacy organizations.
</P>
<P>
   SMALL BOOKS, BIG LIVES: Penguin Putnam is launching a series of
short biographies of famous people written by famous people.
Scheduled for January release, ``Penguin Lives'' will feature
small-format hardback biographies ranging from 128 to 256 pages.
Initial offerings include Larry McMurtry writing about Crazy Horse,
Jane Smiley on Charles Dickens and Mary Gordon writing about Joan
of Arc.
</P>
<P>
   MORE ON MONICA: Random House has signed Jeffrey Toobin to write
a book on the Monica Lewinsky-President Clinton scandal. The book
is expected to be published by late 1999. Toobin, a staff writer
with The New Yorker and a legal commentator on ABC, is the author
of ``The Run of His Life,'' a best-selling account of the O.J.
Simpson case.

 &HT;    Coolness coming to George Washington's home
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL SEPTEMBER 13: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Bob Dart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT VERNON, Va._Nearly 200 years after George Washington died
in an upstairs bedroom of his beloved plantation overlooking the
Potomac River, his house is getting air conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   That's cool with most folks. Millions of summer visitors have
sweated through tours of the carefully preserved home of the
nation's first president, and electric fans are needed to keep
guides from fainting in the stifling heat.
</P>
<P>
   But a few preservationists are downright hot over the decision
by Mount Vernon's governing board to install a $1 million
computerized climate control system in one of America's most
historic homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've died a thousand times over this,'' said Marc A.
LeFrancois, Mount Vernon's former architectural curator, who
resigned in protest over the air conditioning issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``That place is so important,'' LeFrancois told The Associated
Press. ``To do that much damage for something that may not work,
and probably won't work, is just unethical.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not a decision made lightly, conceded James Rees,
resident director of the Mount Vernon Estate and Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1735, Mount Vernon has survived for more than 250 years
without air conditioning. During the sweltering summers, George and
Martha Washington would dine outside on the portico to catch the
breeze blowing in from the river. He loved the view. ``No estate in
the United States is more pleasantly situated than this,''
Washington wrote in 1793.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists today see an estate that is much the same as in
Washington's lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   The Mount Vernon Ladies Association, America's oldest national
historic preservation organization, raised $200,000 to purchase the
500-acre plantation from the first president's great-grandnephew in
the 1850s and has owned and operated it ever since. More than 1
million visitors tour the 18th-century mansion and grounds each
year, making it the nation's second most visited historic home,
ranking behind only the White House.
</P>
<P>
   This is a place where the past is revered. George Washington
walked on the hardwood floors, chose the paintings on the parlor
walls, wrote at the desk in the study, ate hoecakes and honey for
breakfast in the small dining room, fretted over the nearby
furrowed fields and died in the four-poster bed upstairs. Change
does not come easily here.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Rees went to Rome to check out the Sistine Chapel's new
air conditioning before agreeing that a similar system would work
at Mount Vernon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't get to talk to the Pope'' about Btus and air ducts,
said Rees. But he did hire the same company _ Carrier Corp. _ and
the same engineer who designed and installed the system in the
Sistine Chapel.
</P>
<P>
   Final approval was granted in June, and the heating, ventilation
and air conditioning system is scheduled to be operating this
autumn, in time for a yearlong bicentennial commemoration of
Washington's death on Dec. 14, 1799.
</P>
<P>
   After years of considering the pros and cons of air
conditioning, Rees said that technological advances finally tipped
the scales toward installation.
</P>
<P>
   There are drawbacks, he acknowledged. The primary problem is
that ``you have to cut through original fabric in the mansion'' to
put in air ducts and other parts of the system.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have decried this ``irreversible'' destruction of
18th-century plaster and wood. ``It's extremely sad,'' Christine
Meadows, a former Mount Vernon curator, told AP.
</P>
<P>
   However, this is not the first time such action has been deemed
necessary, Rees pointed out. The original structure was cut to
install electricity, heating, lighting and fire protection in
earlier decades.
</P>
<P>
   He said care is being taken to minimize damage to the original
building and more than half of the air condi-
</P>
<P>
   tioning vents were put in without destroying original fabric.
The work was done inside closets and in other hidden areas wherever
possible.
</P>
<P>
   The second major concern was condensation. Mount Vernon is built
of wood, and its historic planks are vulnerable to water damage.
</P>
<P>
   This is where technology came in, Rees said. The computerized
system will ensure that there is never such a difference in
temperature and humidity to cause condensation. The formula is
complex, said Rees, but basically the range will never be more than
15 degrees when the air conditioning is on. Thus, if the outside
temperature is 100 degrees, the temperature inside Mount Vernon
will be about 85 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``People rate below objects'' in this equation, he acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   The entire project is aimed more at preserving the historic
house and furnishings than at providing comfort for visitors and
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``In summer now, we do what George Washington did _ open the
doors and windows,'' said Rees. ``That lets in dirt and dust and
light,'' all of which can damage the historic furnishings.
Carefully controlling the climate will help preserve the mansion's
artifacts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the Smithsonian Institution and other museums and
historic houses will not lend art and furniture that Washington
owned to Mount Vernon because of the uncontrolled environment, said
Rees. Once the HVAC system is working, these traveling exhibits
will enable the curators to make the house even more as it was when
the nation's first First Family lived there, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be able to bring home many of Washington's artifacts
which have been maintained by collectors and museums around the
country,'' said Carter King Laughlin, Mount Vernon's curator.
``Without a modern climate control system, we are limited in the
variety of historical artifacts we can borrow from other
collections to display here.''
</P>
<P>
   To preserve the pastoral setting, the system's condenser is
located in a wooded area about 200 yards from the mansion, hidden
from visitors by trees. Buried pipes connect it to the underground
air handlers in the site of a former archeological dig about 100
feet from the house. The only visible parts of the system will be
small air vents in ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, says Rees, the air conditioning should disturb the
historic ambiance considerably less than the electric fans now in
use to circulate the air in almost every room in the summer.

 &HT;    COLUMN: The great Kurosawa is gone, but his films live on
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The legendary Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa, who died Sunday
at age 88, was not only one of our greatest filmmakers; he was one
of the greatest artists of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Critics raved about his unique blend of humanism and dynamic
cinematic technique _ his vigorous, panoramic battle scenes, for
instance, have few equals. But Kurosawa himself always insisted
that the best way to understand and appreciate his work was not to
read the critiques but to watch his movies. ''There is nothing that
says more about the creator than the work itself,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   In deference to the master, then, let us simply offer some
video-rental suggestions that could serve as a beginner's guide to
The Essential Kurosawa. And don't be frightened by the subtitles;
like all great artists, Kurosawa is as accessible as he is
awe-inspiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``RASHOMON'' (1950)
</P>
<P>
   When shown at the 1951 Venice Film Festival, ``Rashomon'' was an
immediate sensation, winning the Grand Prix and catapulting its
director to international stardom. Not surprisingly, it also became
the first Japanese film ever to win an Oscar (in the best
foreign-language category). Set in medieval Japan, the picture is a
story of rape and death, involving a bandit, a noblewoman, her
husband and a witness. The twist is that it's told four different
times, from the four characters' often contradictory points of
view. The very word ``Rashomon'' has become shorthand for
expressing the relative nature of truth. If the plot sounds
familiar, maybe you saw the Hollywood remake, ``The Outrage,''
starring Paul Newman.
</P>
<P>
   ``SEVEN SAMURAI''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Kurosawa's most famous film, ``Seven Samurai'' is a
masterful blend of beguiling characterizations and state-of-the-art
swordplay. In feudal Japan, a hapless village preyed upon by
bandits pools its meager resources and hires a band of samurai to
rid it of its problem. The group's leader is rational, soft-spoken
Takashi Shimura, but the showstopper (and scene-stealer) is Toshiro
Mifune, who's part force of nature, part lost member of the Three
Stooges. The climactic battle _ a fierce ballet of mud and monsoon
rains _ is one of the greatest sequences ever put on film. This,
too, got the Hollywood treatment. It became ``The Magnificent
Seven,'' starring Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen.
</P>
<P>
   ``THRONE OF BLOOD'' (1957)
</P>
<P>
   Kurosawa and Mifune re-teamed for this striking interpretation
of Shakespeare's ``Macbeth,'' with Mifune cast as the overly
ambitious warrior. The effect is a compelling mix of East and West
_ a sort of tempura-dipped take on the Thane of Cawdor. The cast's
performances are modeled on noh theater techniques; when this
forest of Dunsinane makes its move on the eerie Castle of the
Spider's Web, it's a moment of movie magic. Plus, Mifune's death
scene is one of the most memorable in cinema history (think arrows;
think porcupine). ``Throne of Blood'' also showcased the director's
notorious perfectionism. Not only did he insist that an entire
feudal castle be built for it, but he had the first attempt torn
down because the workers had used anachronistic steel nails.
</P>
<P>
   ``YOJIMBO'' (1961)
</P>
<P>
   Kurosawa and Mifune get together again, with Mifune again cast
as a seen-it-all samurai. The filmmaker apparently got the idea for
the plot from reading Dashiell Hammett's ``Red Harvest.'' Mifune
rides into a grungy, corrupt 19th-century town and decides the
inhabitants would be better off dead than alive. ``I get paid for
killing,'' he says tersely. ``Think about it.'' The movie sounds
grim _ and it certainly isn't a lighthearted romp. But the director
and his star inject a wonderful gallows humor into the bloody
proceedings. For sure, it impressed another master filmmaker:
Sergio Leone. He used ``Yojimbo'' as the inspiration for ``A
Fistful of Dollars,'' the first in his trio of spaghetti western
collaborations with Clint Eastwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``KAGEMUSHA'' (1980)
</P>
<P>
   Co-winner of the top honor at the Cannes Film Festival,
``Kagemusha'' was the first of two sweeping feudal epics that would
crown Kurosawa's career in the 1980s. Yet it is a double-faceted
film _ both a majestic mountain of a movie, with enormous anonymous
armies clashing in the night, and the personal story of a thief who
doubles for a dead warlord. In struggling to imitate the greatness
of another, the thief finds greatness in himself. Thus the shadow
becomes substance (the title roughly translates as ``the shadow
warrior.'') The climax, in which three different divisions, each
clothed in a distinctive color, of the warlord-thief's army mount a
quixotic final charge against the enemy, has a thundering fatalism
that will take your breath away.
</P>
<P>
   ``RAN'' (1985)
</P>
<P>
   Kurosawa melds Shakespeare and ``Shogun'' in this magnificent
16th-century epic that mixes ``King Lear'' with an ancient legend
about a Japanese warlord and his three sons. He also tosses in a
mesmerizing Lady Macbeth figure who cooly seduces and marries her
husband's murderer. But while the Bard's father-daughter betrayals
may have been sharper than a serpent's tooth, Kurosawa's father-son
deceptions are sharper than a samurai's sword. This is a movie of
tumultuous, unforgettable images showing us a misanthropic,
hopeless world where violence seems omnipresent (the title means
``chaos''). Pessimistic and glorious, ``Ran'' reminds us that
geniuses have their bitter side.

FENCES MAKE ODD NEIGHBORS IN NEW SITCOM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If you are an animal, the fictional planned
community of Woodland Heights, Calif. (the name was inspired by
Woodland Hills) is not the place to be.
</P>
<P>
   In three early episodes of ``Living in Captivity's'' premiere
season, rodents die in traps, a cat gets hit by a car, a lap dog is
eaten by a predator, and a guide dog is shot by an overzealous
vigilante.
</P>
<P>
   This same gated community is no place for a television viewer,
either.
</P>
<P>
   The award-winning writing and producing team of Diane English
and Joel Shukovsky (``Murphy Brown,'' ``Ink'') has created a world
with caricatures rather than characters and chock full of
cliche-driven stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   Meet the three families in the show:
</P>
<P>
   Curtis and Tamara Cook (Dondre T. Whitfield and Kira Arne) are
the upwardly mobile, African-American couple adjusting to their new
surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   Will and Becca Marek (Matthew Letscher and Melinda McGraw) are
ultra-liberals, fresh from the city. She is a Jewish lawyer. He is
a novelist who gets inspired when he simulates being chased by an
assailant (Curtis) while jogging.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there are Carmine and Lisa Santucci (Lenny Venito and
Mia Cottet). He is the racist King of Mufflers who has no qualms
about using his gun to seek justice and is apparently a dynamo in
bed. His wife is a stunning blonde who may seem ditsy but has gone
back to college to better herself despite her husband's protests.
</P>
<P>
   The show does get better in its second episode, but resorted to
a sex plot line to pull itself up. Not long after that, the Cooks
will have a baby. Generally, producers wait until a show is old and
tired before a birth is in order. This show will do so within the
first five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for a funnier, smarter version of the
urban-to-suburban exodus, you'd be better off watching ``The
Hughleys,'' an ABC sitcom set to debut on Sept. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, it's animal safe.

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Stuck off to the side of an airport runway,
a number of puny corporate jets nearby, sits a Boeing 727 fit for a
king. Owned by the Sultan of Brunei back when he was the richest
man in the world, the plane passed to Middle East businessmen and
royalty before winding up at Fort Worth Meacham Airport in December
1996. A company there was supposed to perform $12 million in
repairs and renovations to the $16 million craft, which had been
set up to carry no more than 30 people in opulent style. Outfitted
with a bedroom, whirlpool tub, kitchen and couches, the plane was
going to get a new entertainment system, satellite telephones and
fresh upholstery. Instead, its wings were clipped. By LAURA

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Readings at daybreak will hover near 50 degrees from the
northern Gulf States to the Ohio Valley and eastward to the central
Carolinas. These temperatures will be record minimums in many
sections of the Tennessee Valley and interior Southeast. An
expansive area of high pressure covering the eastern section of the
nation will direct cooler, less humid air into the eastern Gulf
Coast, including the northern third of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Chilly, moist air circulating around a storm stalled over the
Canadian Maritimes will keep the Northeast unseasonably cool with
plenty of clouds. A retreating pool of very cool air at 5,000 feet
will limit the number of afternoon showers in the northern
Appalachians. It will stay rather breezy along the New England
coast.
</P>
<P>
   Minimal tropical storm Frances in the western Gulf of Mexico
will likely move onshore near the mouth of the Rio Grande River.
Flash flooding is expected north and west of the center as more
than six inches of new rain should fall in southeast Texas. Clouds
and gusty thundershowers will spread farther inland across
northeast Texas and southwest Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   A surge of hot air will reach into the upper Plains with record
heat in a few spots. Sunshine and balmy breezes from the southwest
will boost readings well above seasonal levels in the Dakotas.
</P>
<P>
   Tropical moisture will feed northward ahead of a cold front in
the Rockies. Thunderstorms will be numerous Thursday afternoon from
Arizona to southern Montana. A wedge of cooler and somewhat drier
air will push into the Pacific Northwest. California will be breezy
with thundershowers developing in the Sierra.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Seattle Warmth
</P>
<P>
   The rainy weather pattern in the Pacific Northwest during winter
can be misleading about the region's climate. For example, summers
in Seattle are much sunnier and drier than its rainy reputation
implies. In summer and early autumn, the jet stream, a river of
high-altitude air that steers inclement low- pressure systems, is
diverted over Canada for most of the time, setting the stage for
spells of sunny, warm weather in Seattle. Last Sunday marked the
city's tenth straight day with temperatures in the 80s. Seattle's
longest streak of 80-degree days was 15, which began on July 30,
1977.

RIOT POLICE, MOBS CLASH FOR THIRD DAY IN CAMBODIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SETH MYDANS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ Restless mobs milled about the city
Wednesday as opposition leaders who had stoked the mobs' anger said
they were powerless to calm the crowds or prevent the violence that
is eroding hopes for democracy and stability here.
</P>
<P>
   For a third day, riot police fired automatic weapons and beat
protesters, mostly tough young men who taunted security forces and
hurled volleys of rocks at them. Human rights workers said a
Buddhist monk had been killed but this could not be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest crowd, of up to 1,000 people, filled the alleyways
behind the U.S. Embassy, scattering wildly when security men
approached, then gathering again with their motorbikes.
</P>
<P>
   The crowds, including students, civil servants and monks in
orange robes, appeared to have no leaders and no clear idea of what
they wanted. The anger that began with opposition protests over the
conduct of an election six weeks ago seemed to have metastasized
into an aimless uprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are really fed up, and what is amazing, they are not
afraid to say so,'' said a Western diplomat. ``This is not about
the election any more. There are no tactics, no strategy. They are
here because they are angry.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an aimless anger, he said, born out of years of
mistreatment and thwarted hopes for peace and stability. Complaints
about election abuses, however valid or exaggerated, have struck a
chord among people who are familiar with abuses by their leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Aimless as it was, much of the anger was expressed as a hatred
of Vietnam, the age-old enemy of Cambodia and the sponsor in the
1980s of Hun Sen, who is now the country's strongman and the
official winner of the July 26 election.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the crowd near the embassy were convinced that the
soldiers who were clubbing them were Vietnamese. At one point the
crowd tried to beat a man they accused of being Vietnamese; he was
saved by two Cambodian human rights workers.
</P>
<P>
   In one sign of the despair that also fuels their anger, many in
the crowd were also convinced that the United States was about to
send troops to rescue them from their own leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere was there talk of King Norodom Sihanouk, whose name is
usually magic for his countrymen but who has remained in seclusion
at his retreat in the ancient city of Siem Reap.
</P>
<P>
   The king has recently voiced his pessimism about Cambodia and
suggested that he might abdicate. Nevertheless, the U.N.
representative here, Lakhan Mehrotra, left for Siem Reap on
Wednesday in the hope that the king might help defuse the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The two opposition leaders who lost the election and then began
a protest campaign had nothing to say to the crowds Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Rainsy, the most bitter opponent of Hun Sen, remained under
the protection of the United Nations after a threat by Hun Sen to
arrest him. For two weeks he had made daily speeches vilifying both
the Vietnamese and Hun Sen, whom he called a Vietnamese puppet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not behind the demonstrators,'' Sam Rainsy told reporters
Wednesday. ``I am in the U.N. office from where I can give no
instructions.''
</P>
<P>
   Prince Norodom Ranariddh, whom Hun Sen has so far failed to
tempt into a government coalition but who has been a
less-than-enthusiastic partner in Sam Rainsy's protests, also
seemed to wash his hands of the demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are moving from peaceful struggle to violent struggle when
people stop listening to me or Sam Rainsy,'' he told reporters at
his party headquarters. ``We are not able to prevent people from
demonstrating.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On the contrary, someone with a computer and a printer
distributed hundreds of anonymous fliers to the demonstrators
Wednesday calling for an uprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soldiers, intellectuals, students, state employees,
compatriots: stand up,'' it read. ``Renew our struggle in order to
defend our nation, our religion and our territory from the
Vietnamese expansionists.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we remain as a bundle of chopsticks we will survive,'' the
fliers said, using an expression that means there is safety in
numbers. ``Don't let the Vietnamese puppets defeat us one by one.''
</P>
<P>
   The fliers caused a stir wherever they were handed out. One
young woman, a hotel receptionist, said: ``It makes me very happy
when I read this. We must fight to save our nation.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Itex Corp., an investment firm in Portland, Ore., last week
filed an anti-defamation lawsuit in an Oregon court. There is just
one catch: Itex is not exactly sure whom it filed the suit against.
</P>
<P>
   The company filed the complaint in Multnomah County Circuit
Court to enjoin certain individuals from writing defamatory
statements against Itex on Yahoo message boards. Trouble is, the
individuals who posted the messages are known only by their online
handles, including ``Orangemuscat,'' and ``Investor727.''
</P>
<P>
   Itex, a public company that brokers and records barter
exchanges, lists ``John Does 1-100'' as the defendants in its
complaint. The suit goes on to say the defendants' ``true
identities will be included in amendments hereto when those
identities are discovered.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Itex declined to comment further on the lawsuit.
Jon Place, Yahoo's general counsel, told The Associated Press that
Yahoo was not responsible for messages posted on the service and
that it had ``no way of knowing who some of the people are.''
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, the lawsuit only seems to have inspired more
venom from the anonymous message posters. One recent message mocked
the suit, and said the company should spend its time on business,
not litigation. It then went on to insult the management, their
wives, their pets and cars.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent Licenses Software for Voice-Recognition
</P>
<P>
   Lucent Technologies, a major developer of industrial-strength
speech-recognition technology, has turned its attention and
expertise to the consumer desktop. The company, based in Murray
Hill, N.J., announced recently that it was licensing software to
developers who wanted to create speech-recognition programs for the
Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The speech-recognition market is increasingly competitive, given
the growing capabilities of the desktop computer, but Lucent
spokesman Chris Pfaff said the company's 20-year tenure in the
technology would be an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're bringing the kind of quality that has been in the phone
network and in business phone systems for years,'' Pfaff said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that logic provides little comfort to callers who
have had bad luck with synthesized telephone operators or other
industrial speech-recognition programs, which have evolved in fits
and starts.
</P>
<P>
   Swissair's Web Site Inundated After Crash
</P>
<P>
   The headlines were chilling. ``Swissair jet crashes,'' ``No
survivors from Swissair crash,'' ``Relatives en route to crash
site.''
</P>
<P>
   These particular headlines, though, did not come from any media
organization, but from Swissair, which posted the news releases
last week on the company's Web site. According to some travel
industry observers, Swissair, whose jetliner crashed off Canada on
Wednesday night of last week, killing 229, appeared to be
disseminating information more quickly than major media outlets.
</P>
<P>
   One result was that the Swissair Web site was inundated with
visitors, to the extent that download and access time at the site
was slowed, said Gil Asakawa, editor of The Complete Traveler, an
online travel magazine based in Denver. Asakawa also said the
efforts by Swissair to update the site represented a maturity on
the part of the travel industry, which he said had learned to use
the Web to keep an anxious public informed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be when there was a plane crash, you had to watch
the news for information,'' he said. ``Now with the Net, you can go
straight to the company of the plane that crashed.''
</P>
<P>
   Swissair could not be reached for comment regarding how much
traffic its Web site received.
</P>
<P>
   Asakawa did offer one caveat about the corporate releases. ``The
information is coming from the company, so there is a spin,'' he
said. ``Still, there is a sense of disclosure there, so that's
really important.''
</P>
<P>
   PC Data Plays Catch-Up in Web-Tracking Survey
</P>
<P>
   Web surfing has become a spectator sport _ one that the
companies are willing to pay to observe.
</P>
<P>
   PC Data, based in Reston, Va., has become the latest market
research firm to enter the fray. It now offers financial incentives
to Internet users in exchange for getting to track not just their
every move in cyberspace, but also which hardware and software
products they use.
</P>
<P>
   Participants in the survey, called (AT)PC Data, download
software that sits on their home computer and monitors their
computer and Internet use patterns. In exchange, PC Data provides
discounts on Internet service, and, for those who stay on as guinea
pigs for six months, frequent-flier miles and telephone calling
cards.
</P>
<P>
   While this might sound novel, PC Data is playing catch-up.
Already, its competitors, including Media Metrix, Relevant
Knowledge and Net Ratings, have offered similar programs for some
time, acknowledged Frank Catalano, acting managing director for
Internet monitoring at (AT)PC Data.
</P>
<P>
   Catalano said he believed PC Data still could be on the
``bleeding edge'' of monitoring software usage, which the company's
software also measures. He added that the market would continue to
grow in size and importance as advertisers and Web designers, among
others, clamored for reliable data about Internet use patterns.

   A Family Video Store Cuts 2 `Titanic' Scenes
</P>
<P>
   James Cameron won an Oscar for directing ``Titanic.'' Now Carol
Biesinger, the owner of a video rental store in Utah, is winning
business for making some creative cuts to the biggest-selling movie
of all time.
</P>
<P>
   For $5, Sunrise Family Video in American Fork, Utah, which does
not rent R-rated movies, will cut two steamy scenes from home video
copies of ``Titanic.'' Ms. Biesinger said she got the idea after
customers complained they would not be able to share it with their
children.
</P>
<P>
   The scenes Ms. Biesinger trims in her back office include one in
which Kate Winslet, who plays the heroine, appears topless and one
in which she and her co-star, Leonardo DiCaprio, steam up the
windows of an automobile. For an additional $3, Ms. Biesinger will
cut other scenes at the customer's request.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had customer after customer come in and talk about the
movie,'' she said. ``They said they couldn't sit on the couch and
watch it with the family without being embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   The procedure to cut the film is fairly basic and takes only 10
minutes, she said. However, thanks to the more than 1,000 orders
Sunrise video has received for the surgical procedure, the wait is
five weeks, even longer if it is a mail-order job.
</P>
<P>
   The wait is not the only sticking point. Ms. Biesinger said she
received a call from Paramount Pictures asking her to cease her
unilateral cutting and pasting. She said she told the movie house
she would do so ``when they proved it is illegal.'' Then, she said,
she would quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not out to break the law,'' she said. ``We're just trying
to meet a demand.''

   Over the Hills and Into Valleys With Digital Television Signals
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of companies involved in the advancement of digital
television is touting a new technological breakthrough in the
industry. A group of engineers last week successfully tested
technology that will allow them to more efficiently redirect
digital television signals into hard-to-reach geographic areas,
like valleys and areas behind ridges and mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The advance comes as the broadcast industry prepares to meet a
Nov. 1 deadline to begin moving from broadcasting traditional
analog signals to sending digital signals. Under the analog
standard, when broadcasters wanted to reach more isolated areas,
they would often have to transmit a signal to a more accessible
destination, then rebroadcast it on another channel.

   Dell Breaks a Size Barrier for Screens for Portable PCs
</P>
<P>
   Dell Computer has broken another barrier for screen size on
portable PCs. The new Dell Inspiron 7000 features an active matrix
screen that measures a full 15 inches.
</P>
<P>
   While it doesn't exactly break the four-minute mile, the new
monitor does set the pace for the market-chasing portable users who
want a full display, even at the expense of a slightly sore lap
(the Inspiron weighs in at 8.9 pounds). Priced at $2,999, the
Inspiron comes with 64 megabytes of memory and a 300-MHz Pentium II
Processor. &QL;

BOOK TALK: MAKING MONICA WORTH THE EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 C.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The summer started with book publishers' oscillating around
Monica Lewinsky and it ended the same way. In between, the United
States and maybe publishing have been afflicted with the newly
identified disease TMI (too much information).
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, the tutelaries of Ms. Lewinsky's interests have
planted a report that she has turned down a mere $6 million
advance. Not true; no such bid was ever made. Another publisher was
said to have offered $2 million. This was denied, but publishing
people have said that an offer in that neighborhood was made.
</P>
<P>
   What is certain is that the financial risk for a Lewinsky book
is huge, but it's not just earning out the advance or the book's
message that makes such a book a perilous undertaking. It isn't
even TMI.
</P>
<P>
   The real problem is greater than all of that, many in publishing
say. A book by Ms. Lewinsky becomes an all-consuming task for its
publishing house (or its imprint) and a tyrant that virtually
chokes most of the publisher's resources for the duration of the
project, which could last a year. In short, an effect as clogging
to the publisher as it is to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, every aspect of producing such a book _ acquisition,
editing, publication, distribution, marketing _ must be done in the
deepest secrecy. There can be no leaks. The book at least has to be
revelatory.
</P>
<P>
   One publishing executive, asked if a book by Ms. Lewinsky could
succeed commercially, spoke on the condition of anonymity and said:
``Perhaps, if it is revealing, reflective and timely, and its
confidentiality kept until the book is in the stores. Then maybe it
could sell a lot of copies. But can any of the characters involved
produce a reflective book?''
</P>
<P>
   Protecting a manuscript against gossipy seepage is a tremendous
task and rarely successful, particularly for a project that has an
international press probing and prying for its juiciness.
</P>
<P>
   A publisher cannot simply assign the book to an editor and say,
``Take care of it,'' as is routinely done. Sloppiness and mistakes
would doom the project. Ms. Lewinsky and her writers and advisers
would have to be protected; the work's initial effort would have to
be enhanced, probably greatly; some sincere sympathy for her would
have to emanate from its pages.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky is not, as some in publishing say, merely another
Paula Barbieri of fleeting O.J. Simpson fame. She could bring down
a presidency, so hers would be a book with extraordinary editing
problems that easily could engage all of a house's top editors,
even if Ms. Lewinsky had a very experienced co-writer. Moreover,
nearly everything in it would have to be examined by layers of
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Without this enormous exertion, making a successful mega-memoir
of Lewinsky material would be problematic at best. And, while all
this energy would be concentrated on the Lewinsky manuscript, what
would happen to the rest of the books on the publisher's list? Most
would be neglected _ causing what one publishing executive called
``an implosion in the publishing house, even if the publisher could
sell 2 million copies in two months,'' an impossibility.
</P>
<P>
   The other main problem in such a ``hot topic'' book is content.
``Often, after everybody is caught up in the swirling of the book
deal, the lawyers, the advisers, the spinners and the subject
aren't really comfortable putting on paper what you as publisher
feel readers are interested in,'' one publisher said. ``You signed
up one book but get another, and when you see it in print you are
left with a name, a memory and not much else.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the publisher added, Ms. Lewinsky ``is the most
talked-about figure since O.J. Simpson, and if you are a betting
person, you can take the chance that there's enough residual
interest left for the millions of people talking about the scandal
that a couple of hundred thousand would buy the book.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, eventually the curious will be able to buy the bushel
of reports that Kenneth Starr sent to Congress on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the mounds of Simpson books sunk unread in an ocean
of remainders. The book by the case's prosecutor, Marcia Clark, was
a $4.2 million calamity for Viking. Another publisher, also
speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that ``as tragic as
the Simpson case was, it showed the rich and famous doing
horrifying things, like a soap opera.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of an inappropriate relationship between Ms. Lewinsky
and President Clinton, the publisher added, ``makes your stomach
turn and reminds everyone why they don't like politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   This vast difference between the murderous and the merely
disgusting may be another reason that there has been no rash of
books offered on the president's personal life, some publishers
have speculated.
</P>
<P>
   As it did with the Simpson case (``The Run of His Life: The
People vs. O.J. Simpson''), Random House has signed up Jeffrey
Toobin to write a serious book about the relationship, examining
the legal issues of the scandal and the concept behind the
independent prosecutor's role and how it is now playing out. That
doesn't rule out another book on the subject from another Random
House imprint or division, but that's not likely.
</P>
<P>
   When talking about a Lewinsky book, few in publishing reject it
on any grounds other than that it's bad business. Jack Romanos, the
president of Simon &AMP; Schuster's consumer group, said, ``I'm hard
pressed to think of any kiss-and-tell, other-woman book that
actually worked well.'' Anyhow, Romanos stands on high moral ground
because Simon &AMP; Schuster publishes Hillary Rodham Clinton, so it's
certainly not going to trash down to publish a Clinton-scandal
book.
</P>
<P>
   But out there some publisher is getting ready to take the flier
for a million or two because most in book publishing believe that
with luck a book is, as more than one in the business said,
possibly ``doable'' even at that level of advance. As Romanos said,
``If the book is flying out of the stores, some book company
wouldn't mind being consumed.'' And once Ms. Lewinsky is signed up,
there's always Linda Tripp.

GOLF NOTEBOOK: TENSION MOUNTS FOR SOLHEIM; DUVAL WANTS A MAJOR; '99
TOUR SCHEDULE RELEASED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Next week's Solheim Cup will put the women involved on golf's
center stage, and players on both sides already feel the tension.
</P>
<P>
   The biennial match-play competition between women from the
United States and Europe takes place Sept. 18-20 at Muirfield
Village Golf Club in Dublin, Ohio. The United States holds the cup,
after its 17-11 victory in 1996 in Wales. However, this year's
European team may be the strongest ever, led by Annika Sorenstam,
Liselotte Neumann, Laura Davies, Helen Alfredsson and Lisa Hackney.
</P>
<P>
   Most players expect a tense battle, with the outcome decided by
the final few singles matches on Sept. 20. Thinking about that
possibility has the players both excited and nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody can really understand,'' Alfredsson said
when asked about the pressure of the Solheim Cup. ``As much as you
can celebrate with 11 other players, you also have 11 other players
depending on you. There could be a scapegoat. All the emotions you
feel are accentuated because you're with a team. And you don't want
to be the one who messes up.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfredsson, Sorenstam, Neumann, Charlotta Sorenstam, Catrin
Nilsmark and Sophie Gustafson of Sweden will be joined on the
European team by Davies, Hackney, Trish Johnson and Alison Nicholas
of England, Catriona Matthew of Scotland and Marie-Laure de Lorenzi
of France. The U.S. team includes Donna Andrews, Brandie Burton,
Tammie Green, Pat Hurst, Juli Inkster, Chris Johnson, Rosie Jones,
Betsy King, Meg Mallon, Dottie Pepper, Kelly Robbins and Sherri
Steinhauer. Europe will be captained by Pia Nilsson, while Judy
Rankin will captain the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Muirfield Village was the site of one of the most memorable
Ryder Cups in 1987, when Europe defeated the United States by
15-13, giving the European men their first Ryder Cup victory on
American soil. That helped propel the Ryder Cup toward the
popularity it enjoys today, and the women hope that a trip to
Muirfield, designed by Jack Nicklaus and one of the world's top
courses, can help lift the Solheim Cup to new heights as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played nine holes at Muirfield, and I was absolutely in
awe,'' Alfredsson said. ``The quality of the place is absolutely
fabulous. You better bring your best game.''
</P>
<P>
   A few of the world's best players _ Se Ri Pak of South Korea,
Karrie Webb of Australia and Lorie Kane of Canada _ will be
noticeably absent from the Solheim Cup. There has been talk that
the Solheim Cup format should be changed to include players not
born in either the United States or Europe, but Alfredsson
disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a shame that some of the best players don't
belong to any team, but I think this event should stay the way it
is,'' she said. ``It's going to be a great match on a great golf
course.''
</P>
<P>
   A Special Year for Duval
</P>
<P>
   Leading the PGA Tour money list, winning three tournaments and
having a chance to become the first golfer to win $3 million in a
season have already made this a special year for David Duval. Who
cares that he has not won a major? Duval does. But after finishing
tied for second at the Masters, Duval knows he has the game to win
a major, and he will not let the lack of a victory overshadow his
other impressive accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majors are important,'' said Duval, who is looking forward
to defending his title at next month's Tour Championship at East
Lake Golf Club in Atlanta. ``Everybody wants to win one. After the
four majors, you can probably throw the Players Championship in.
Then I think you have to look at tournaments like the World Series
and the Tour Championship as the most elite. I've won two of those
second-tier events, so I certainly feel like I have the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval admitted that he is still hurt by the finish at the
Masters in April, when he reached the 16th tee holding a
three-stroke lead but lost by one stroke to Mark O'Meara, who
birdied three of the last four holes. ``I put up a good fight,''
Duval said. ``Through that experience, if I'm not going to win a
major, I don't want to finish second. I want to finish third or
fourth. It's really like getting kicked in the teeth, finishing
second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond that, I don't really want to go into it, because it
still brings up bad feelings. You know, you have it dangling right
in front of you, and it's just too much of a tease. But I look
forward to the challenge of the next few years. Maybe I'll
capitalize, maybe I won't.''
</P>
<P>
   1999 Opener Shifted to Hawaii
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 PGA Tour schedule has been released. The season-opening
Mercedes Championships (Jan. 7-10) will be moved from California to
Hawaii. The Buick Classic at Westchester Country Club in Rye, N.Y.,
will be held June 24-27, the week after the U.S. Open. The first of
next year's three World Golf Championships events will be the
Andersen Consulting Match Play championship, to be held Feb. 24-28
at LaCosta Resort &AMP; Spa in Carlsbad, Calif.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The Royal Opera House, buffeted in recent months by
financial and management disasters that left it teetering on the
brink of insolvency, announced Wednesday that it had worked out a
radical solution to its problems. Starting in January, it said, it
will close for almost a year, canceling all opera and most ballet
performances until December 1999 to save money and put its affairs
in order.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Sir Colin Southgate, the Royal Opera's
chairman, said that the far-reaching plan, worked out in emergency
meetings of the opera's board, would also include a ``significant
reduction'' in its staff of 560 people, as well as offering cheaper
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The days for fudging are long past,'' said Sir Colin, who was
appointed in January and has asserted that the opera house's
troubles are a result of years of financial mismanagement. ``The
board is sad at the pain this will cause our work force, but only a
total restructuring will achieve real results. We cannot afford the
present situation, and yet we must not lose the Royal Opera
House.''
</P>
<P>
   The opera house itself, in Covent Garden, is currently closed
while it undergoes a $350 million refurbishment, financed in large
part with proceeds from the National Lottery. Although its opera
and ballet companies have continued to perform, audiences have been
reluctant to follow them to their various venues, in and outside
London. And the opera house's well-publicized financial troubles
have reduced the flow of charitable donations to a trickle.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Colin said that the opera house's deficit stood at $21
million, and that without next year's closing it would be likely to
increase to $41 million by March 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will seriously run out of cash by the end of this year, and
we need to learn to live within our means,'' he said. ``Without
this, we would have ended up with a hole in the ground, and
bankrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's announcement was greeted with dismay by the opera
house's employees, whose numbers have already been slashed in the
last year, from a high of nearly 900 people. Under the package,
staff members were told that they would have to accept
``renegotiated working conditions,'' meaning that those who do not
get laid off will almost surely see reductions in their salaries.
</P>
<P>
   The opera has set a deadline of Oct. 26 to settle its new
contracts with its workers and has warned that there could be mass
layoffs if the plan is rejected. If contract agreements are
reached, the opera house said, the Royal Ballet will be able to go
ahead with its planned Asian tour next April and to perform at
Sadler's Wells in London in July.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Morrissey, assistant general secretary of the union that
represents the opera's staff, described the proposal as
``outrageous.'' If ``you wish to retain the finest opera and ballet
companies in the world, then you have to employ the best staff,''
he said, adding, ``Once again, the people who work so hard to put
on some of the highest-quality shows in the world are being
sacrificed to save the suits.''
</P>
<P>
   But the plan was welcomed Wednesday by the British government,
whose annual grant of almost $24 million makes the Royal Opera the
mostly highly subsidized arts organization in Britain. The
government has long sought to force the opera house to earn the
subsidy by shedding its elitist image, making itself more
accessible to the public and working out a viable financial plan so
that it would not require emergency infusions of cash.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a letter to Sir Colin, Culture Secretary Chris Smith said:
``I welcome the proposals you and your board have made towards a
radical restructuring and managed process to see the Royal Opera
House through the rest of the closure period. I am grateful to you
and your board for the visionary approach you are taking towards
securing the ROH's long-term future.''
</P>
<P>
   He promised that the opera house could expect to see an increase
in its annual grant if it followed through on all its proposals. A
crucial part of the new plan, said Sir Colin, is the opera house's
promise to knock about $33 off its high- and medium-price tickets.
The most costly seats will now be about $149 each, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At these prices it will be cheaper to come to 30 performances
of opera than buy a season ticket for Chelsea football club,'' he
said. Once the opera house has demonstrated that it is a viable
business, he added, it will be able to resume its normal level of
performances, some 320 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we have proved that we are running a modern, flexible
organization,'' Sir Colin said, ``then we will get support from the
private and public sector.''

 &HT;    CONGRESS AGAIN WEIGHS FATE OF A PRESIDENT
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nearly a quarter of a century after a
Democratic-led House Judiciary Committee voted to impeach Richard
Nixon, a Republican president, the same panel, now in Republican
hands, holds in its hands the fate of President Clinton, a
Democratic president who stands accused by an independent
prosecutor of seeking to cover up his White House affair with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In the Watergate scandal that drove Nixon from office in 1974,
the key question was what did the president know about a burglary
at the Democratic National Committee and when did he know it. In
the current sex scandal, the key questions are both highly personal
and notably tawdry _ including, perhaps, what constitutes a sex
act?
</P>
<P>
   The first question facing Congress is how much weight to put on
the voluminous report of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr that
reached Capitol Hill on Wednesday. During the Nixon impeachment
proceedings, that office did not exist, although two special
counsels, Archibald Cox and Leon Jaworski, pursued the case against
Nixon relatively free from Justice Department supervision.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the House Judiciary Committee must now decide whether
to conduct its own investigation, using the Starr report as a road
map, or to move directly into impeachment hearings, as they did in
the Nixon case.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Starr report will presumably remain secret until
the House votes on how to deal with it, most likely later this
week, that issue has already been joined.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not planning for an impeachment,'' said Rep. John
Conyers, D-Mich., the committee's ranking Democrat, several hours
before the lawmakers received the long-awaited documents. ``We
are,'' he added, ``inquiring into whether or not Article II,
Section 4 (of the Constitution, providing for removal of officials
who commit high crimes or misdemeanors) has been violated and is
worthy of consideration of whatever it is Mr. Starr sends up.''
</P>
<P>
   But other House leaders who dealt with the so-called Starr
``referral'' seemed to suggest by their remarks that the
impeachment of President Clinton was well within the realm of
possibility and must be approached in the most solemn manner.
</P>
<P>
   As House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., put it: ``We think that
the only way this can work for the good of the nation is for it to
be seen as constitutional process that requires judgment, that is
based on fact, and in which there is a very serious effort to work
together and to try to find ways to work together.''
</P>
<P>
   The same bipartisan spirit also infused the hearings and the
ultimate vote against Nixon. In 1974, the balance of power on the
panel rested with four moderate Republicans and several Southern
Democrats, who remained uncommitted until the final tally
approached.
</P>
<P>
   Both then and now, as then Rep. Gerald R. Ford, R-Mich., put it
memorably in 1970, ``an impeachable offense is whatever the
majority of the House of Representatives considers it to be at a
given moment in history.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, in 1974, the committee members found that ``making false
or misleading public statements for the purpose of deceiving the
people of the United States'' constituted justifiable grounds for
impeaching Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   That position was supported by Hillary Rodham, then a
26-year-old Democratic committee staff member fresh out of Yale Law
School. She worked with a California lawyer named Joseph Woods Jr.
who stressed that Article II, which stresses the president duty to
``take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,'' was the crux of
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Clinton's political fate is subject to a political
judgment. As it happens, this is precisely how the framers of the
Constitution envisioned the process working more than 200 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachable offenses, Alexander Hamilton wrote in the Federalist
Papers, ``are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be
dominated (as) political, as they relate chiefly to injuries done
immediately to society.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether the fallout from a sexual affair
constitutes a constitutional ``high crime or misdemeanor.'' In the
end, Congress will decide, which is what both Hamilton and Hillary
Rodham argued in their time is the best course to follow.

`FOR KINGS AND PLANETS': MISSOURI BOY MEETS NEW YORK; GUESS WHO
WINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (Bold-faced words should be italicized)  
 (bl)  
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The story told in Ethan Canin's shimmering new novel, ``For
Kings and Planets,'' is deceptively familiar. Orno Tarcher, the son
of a stolid Missouri family, arrives as a freshman at Columbia
University in the fall of 1974 and is dazzled _ by New York City,
by his fellow students, by his teachers and particularly by his
classmate and new friend, Marshall Emerson, the brilliant son of
two Columbia professors so well-connected socially that as Orno
tells his parents: ``There's letters on his wall from John F.
Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson. His mother talks on the phone with
Margaret Mead. They're friends with artists and writers.''
</P>
<P>
   But by the end Orno has discovered that brilliance and
connections are meaningless, particularly when measured by his
father's simple standard that ``all a man ever has is himself.''
</P>
<P>
   An almost banal tale based on nearly trite verities then. But in
Canin's luminous prose, the story reads as if told for the first
time. Paradoxically, by writing a novel of a young man's
development, he has fulfilled the rich promise of his two
collections of stories, ``Emperor of the Air'' and ``The Palace
Thief,'' and his flawed first novel, ``Blue River.''
</P>
<P>
   The characters in ``For Kings and Planets'' seem freshly
original. Orno moves haltingly under the weight of his insecurity
and lack of belief in himself, yet his integrity is deep, he
hungers for experience and he is determined to make up for his
intellectual shortcomings by outworking everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   He feels particularly overmatched by his unlikely new friend,
Marshall, who doesn't even have to attend classes because, driven
by his demanding father, he has already read practically
everything, and, thanks to his photographic memory, he can score
100 on any test he takes.
</P>
<P>
   Orno doesn't know what to make of Marshall, who praises him for
his straightforwardness, invites him into his artistic circle,
takes him home to meet his parents and younger sister, Simone,
charms him with brilliantly told stories of his childhood in
Istanbul and then suddenly appears to drop him.
</P>
<P>
   Only when Marshall calls on Orno to rescue him during a suicide
attempt do we begin to sense the hollowness behind Marshall's
dazzling facade. ``Things are difficult for Marshall,'' Simone
tells Orno in the hospital. Marshall's mother adds: ``We must be
ready for the worst. We must harden our hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   But Orno remains loyal even after Marshall drops out of
Columbia, moves to Los Angeles to write a novel and begins to rise
as a television scriptwriter and producer.
</P>
<P>
   Orno puts up with Marshall's disapproval of his settling for
dental school after failing to get into any medical school. (``My
father could get you into medical school by picking up the phone,''
Marshall assures him. ``It would take him 10 minutes, two phone
calls.'') He becomes inextricably involved with Marshall's family
when he and Simone fall in love. And he falls into the path of
Marshall's seemingly inevitable self-destruction.
</P>
<P>
   How this plays itself out is too suspenseful and surprising even
to be hinted at here. But Canin makes the reader ache and thrill
with Orno's experience of it. Particularly he captures the moods of
the story's locales, the infinite flatness of Orno's home in
Missouri, the imperial architecture of New York City, the sand and
salt of Cape Cod, where the Emersons own a cottage in Woods Hole,
and ``the bantam vistas truncated by woodsy hills'' of inland
Maine, where Orno eventually sets up his dental practice.
</P>
<P>
   The way he conveys the atmosphere of this part of Maine is by
giving examples of the belongings every household seemed to be
selling: ``a single pan, a girl's grass-stained clothes, a box of
chipped filling-station plates and a tied-up wad of whittled
fishing floats.''
</P>
<P>
   When Orno arrives at Columbia he gives some of Marshall's
friends his earnest view ``that each generation improved upon the
mistakes of the last.'' They laugh at him, saying it is ``a
Midwestern outlook.'' Orno joins in their laughter, but it is a
view he strives to hold on to.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the novel, after all he goes through with the
Emersons, he sees a pack of gulls flocking over the corpse of a
fish and watches their attack. ``They circled and dived, baffling
one another with their wings as they hovered, then dropped like
stones onto the carcass. He understood that this was the normal
course of the world's savagery; but even at this moment, despite
everything, he understood that at the core of him he felt humans
were different.''
</P>
<P>
   He concludes: ``Hardship  &UR; made &LR;  character; hardship  &UR; broke &LR; 
character; that was the paradox. Character to him was kindness and
diligence and a certain social egalitarianism that was fundamental
to society, and he still believed somehow that all three were
instinctive. This, perhaps, was his unbending core.''
</P>
<P>
   What keeps him in touch with this core is the down-to-earthness
that enables him to settle on dentistry as his calling. As he
writes to Marshall, ``I'm beginning to relax enough to enjoy it,
and I see that there  &UR; is &LR;  something adamant and useful and (I'll
say it)  &UR; graceful &LR;  about teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier he has written to Marshall: ``Yes, I have learned the
names of the teeth, but they are probably not what you had hoped
for, not named for kings or planets. They are merely numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   In his novel, Canin illuminates both these realms, those of
metaphor and literalness. Surprisingly in a world where tongues are
eloquent, what the heart can grasp prevails.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Kings and Planets'' leaves you wounded and healed.

 &HT;    Former Surgeon General not pleased with current anti-tobacco
legislation
 &HT;    By Gita M. Smith
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala._Americans will cough their way into the 21st
century and die by the millions from tobacco-related illnesses,
former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop warned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the Rotary Club of Birmingham, the pediatric surgeon
who led the fight against second-hand smoke during his eight-year
tenure as Surgeon General in the 1980s called for national
``outrage that the Congress still has failed to pass anti-tobacco
legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation is apparently ready to condemn the president over a
blue dress, but ignores the buying and selling of its Congress by
tobacco lobbyists. Where is the outrage?'' Koop asked.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco leads his list of unresolved health problems that the
United States will carry into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the year 2025, close to 500 million people worldwide who
are now living will have died of a tobacco-related disease, a rate
of one death every 1.7 seconds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Koop expressed concerns about the use of rapidly expanding
knowledge of genetics and managed care, among other health issues
he said will follow us past the year 2000:
</P>
<P>
   ``What to do about the tremendous number of people who are
getting to be as old as I am - 82?'' he said. ``How are we going to
handle the knowledge that we are accumulating about human
genetics?''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers in the1980s began mapping the location of human
genes and chromosomes to find causes for inheritable illnesses, an
ongoing project that raises questions about testing, privacy and
selective reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, we have to face the fact that managed care, responding
to market forces as a way of doing business, has not been able to
do what it promised, which was to raise the quality, reduce the
cost and improve efficiency of medical care. Something has to be
done to manage managed care,'' he said.

 &HT;    New season Of ``Oprah'' seems a little different from last
season
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now there's violence on ``The Oprah Winfrey Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not the gutter brawls like you see on ratings competitor
``Jerry Springer.'' Not the hair pulling. Not the pimp slapping.
Not the chair throwing.
</P>
<P>
   But violence it is.
</P>
<P>
   There's Winfrey on Wednesday with her new ``change your life''
guru John Gray (``Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus''), who
hands a big wooden stick to an audience member named Debbie. She's
feeling real guilty because no matter how hard she tries, she can't
make everyone she knows happy.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie's then instructed to whack a red box with the word
``Guilt'' written on it. And whack it Debbie does with her best
Mark McGwire swing. Bam!
</P>
<P>
   This week Winfrey has launched a new season of her daily talk
show. And, somehow, talk just doesn't seem to fit this show any
more.
</P>
<P>
   Call it a daily chakra show.
</P>
<P>
   Winfrey has reinvented herself, her show, her mission, her set,
her theme song (she sings it herself). On Tuesday she meditated,
was shown lounging serenely in a bathtub surrounded by lighted
candles and talking about ``Remembering Your Spirit.'' On Wednesday
she sported a quite fashionable long tan skirt. She looks great.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oprah'' is now all about learning who you are with a capital
``YOU.'' She's calling it ``Change Your Life TV'' and part of that
will include a free, over-the-tube seminar each Wednesday with
Gray.
</P>
<P>
   ``Determine for yourself your soul's true desire.'' ``Everyone's
pain is the same.'' ``Personal success is not deemed by
possessions.'' ``The secret of success is intention.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Winfrey's shown sitting by a pond, dabbing her bare feet
in the water and chronicling in her daily journal the things she's
grateful for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm amazed at each little blossom,'' she writes. ``I'm
grateful to return to the farm and all of its green glory.''
</P>
<P>
   And you can't help but wonder what's going on over on
``Springer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Dumping You!'' is Jerry's mantra for this day. A mom comes
on stage, reaches over and slaps a guy named Jason a good one. Mom
wants him out of her daughter's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're a big fat liar, Jason,'' she screams. ``You ain't gonna
do nothin' ... you need to get out of her life and leave her
alone!''
</P>
<P>
   Over on ``Oprah,'' Winfrey says, ``What I believe is that we are
all looking for something deeper, greater.''
</P>
<P>
   Flip to ``Springer'': Three female audience members say their
goodbyes to the camera. Then turn around quickly and bend over ``to
show our bootys for you, Jerry.''
</P>
<P>
   SEEN AND HEARD
</P>
<P>
   Dan Rather and Larry King on the same team?
</P>
<P>
   CNN and CBS News are holding preliminary talks about a possible
merger, but don't look for anything to come of it. The two have
held similar talks several times over the past few years and
nothing has happened yet, or really ever come close.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the rumors of talks are true, and they come as CBS News
is faced with cutting a reported $40 million out of its budget.
There's speculation inside CBS that it's CBS executives who are
leaking word of the talks, and that their goal is convincing Wall
Street analysts the network is serious about reducing costs, which
would have a positive impact on CBS's stock.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, merger talks have broken down because neither side
would yield control over a merged operation to the other. There's
little apparent reason at this point to think that's changed.

<P>
   USHUAIA, Argentina _ Like many mothers in Argentina, Graciela
Fernandez Meijilde can remember the night years ago when the
Argentine security forces knocked at the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was closer to insanity than sanity,'' she said of the night
in 1976 when her 17-year-old son Pablo, wearing nothing but a
jacket pulled over his shoulders, was taken away.
</P>
<P>
   Now she is one of the three leading candidates to succeed Carlos
Saul Menem as president of Argentina next year.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Fernandez Meijilde is a member of Congress from
Buenos Aires Province, she is considered by some to be an unlikely
presidential candidate. She has no experience in economic policy
and has never served in the executive branch. She makes her own
clothes, and has been known to celebrate her political victories by
performing exuberant dance steps in her bare feet in public.
</P>
<P>
   But her candidacy automatically gains stature from her painful
personal experience, which reflects so much of Argentina's recent
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided to do something to construct a new country,'' she
said on a campaign flight to snowy Tierra del Fuego. She recalled
the weeks she spent 22 years ago vainly knocking on the doors of
police precincts and government buildings searching for Pablo,
whose fate she has never learned. ``To change things, you need to
have power,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Just by running a serious campaign, Ms. Fernandez Meijilde has
shown how much Argentina has changed since military rule ended 15
years ago. For all of the country's problems, it is now a place
where candidates like Mrs. Fernandez Meijilde _ who accuses top
officials in the government of arms-trafficking and corruption _
can compete for power safely and openly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sure thing,'' she said of her prospects in the Nov. 29
primary balloting against the mayor of Buenos Aires, Fernando de la
Rua, for the nomination of the Alliance opposition coalition. ``The
country is tired of the two old parties and their machines.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls indicate that she is neck and neck or slightly behind, and
that a majority of people believe she is the most likely candidate
to tackle corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The primary winner will almost certainly face Eduardo Duhalde,
the governor of Buenos Aires Province and leading Justicialist
Party candidate now that Menem has dropped his candidacy. In a race
with Duhalde, recent polls indicate, she would win _ although the
margin has narrowed since the heady days last October after she led
the Alliance to victory in congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   At 67, with dark bags under her eyes and a persistent cough that
seems to come with campaign fatigue, Ms. Fernandez Meijilde does
not look scripted for the part of president. But she projects an
image that reflects the suffering of her past. In fact, her image
is the most successful part of her message, some political experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her past gives her a certain stature,'' said Carlos Escude, a
political scientist at Di Tella University in Buenos Aires. ``Even
people who dislike her have to avoid appearing disrespectful to a
person who has suffered so much from her country's troubles.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout her two-day campaign swing through this town of
50,000 people at the southern tip of South America, Ms. Fernandez
Meijilde, once a high-school French teacher, looked nothing if not
dignified in her proper dark suits and simple overcoat.
</P>
<P>
   She kissed babies and encouraged people to call her Graciela,
and her easy, populist touch attracted emotional greetings and
embraces from strangers, particularly women.
</P>
<P>
   She supports moderate social change but political continuity.
Its a message intended to energize the lower- and lower-middle
classes while calming the business sector and investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great national sport in Argentina is to attack our
institutions,'' she said in a television interview in a restaurant
on Ushuaia's wharf, with bobbing sailboats as a backdrop. ``No one
believes in the courts. No one believes in Congress. No one trusts
the executive branch. We have to change that.''
</P>
<P>
   She spoke passionately of the need for better schools and more
jobs and especially of the need to shake up government to control
corruption. But she is short on specifics, especially when it comes
to economic policy, although she promises not to reverse the Menem
policy of privatizing government agencies and pegging the value of
the peso to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   During a campaign speech to an adoring crowd of 500 people in an
elementary school gymnasium here, some of her biggest applause
lines were remarkably unremarkable _ a reflection, perhaps, of how
unconvulsive politics are in Argentina at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Promising to increase exports, she said, ``An ambassador who
doesn't sell will not be an ambassador for long.'' In another
message received enthusiastically, she said, ``I guarantee that
when I govern the country the message will be simple: Anyone who
steals will not have political cover.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Despite her long history as a human rights activist and opponent
of military rule, she shows how much times have changed by giving
no more than a passing, indirect reference to human rights in her
standard campaign speech. Argentine reporters rarely ask her about
the political disappearances anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a big theme for the society today,'' she said in
another interview. ``It's a memory and lesson of what a
dictatorship means.'' If elected president, she says, she will have
good relations with the military.
</P>
<P>
   Her cautious message has incited some sharp criticism from the
left and the news media. ``I don't know what her campaign platform
is,'' said Hector Marcos Timerman, director of Trespuntos, a weekly
political magazine. ``There is nothing significant about her
politically.''
</P>
<P>
   But if her strategy is not to rock the boat, even with 14
percent unemployment and a slowing economy, it seems to fit a
regional pattern.
</P>
<P>
   In Chile and Uruguay, Socialist presidential candidates doing
well in the polls are running as moderates. In Brazil, Luiz Inacio
Lula da Silva of the Workers Party has challenged free-market
policies of the current government, but he is dropping in the polls
despite growing economic troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The left has an opportunity,'' said Felipe Noguera, a Buenos
Aires poll-taker and political expert, ``but I'm not sure it has a
message.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the reactions in Ushuaia, many of Ms. Fernandez
Meijilde's supporters are not looking for a revolution, just a
break from corruption investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a light, a hope, a figure you can believe in,'' Mirta
Barutia, 44, who owns a clothing store here, said after hearing Ms.
Fernandez Meijilde speak. ``She's an antithesis of the government
we have _ her humility, honesty.''

`LIVING IN CAPTIVITY': MINGLING WITH UNLIKELY NEIGHBORS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Three couples walk into a gated community. One is black and
affluent; one is white and liberal; one is white and possibly
mob-affiliated. Can they find happiness and true friendship in a
Fox sitcom?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is up for grabs. ``Living in Captivity,'' which has
its premiere Friday, comes from Diane English and Joel Shukovsky,
who gave the world both ``Murphy Brown'' and ``The Louie Show.''
And the first three episodes teeter between daringly honest ethnic
humor and bad taste.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, the black couple, Curtis and Tamara Cooke, are a
little puzzled by the all-whiteness of their new neighborhood.
Curtis (Dondre T. Whitfield) remembers looking at the brochure.
``There were happy black people on the cover,'' he reminds Tamara
(Kira Arne), who is close to nine months pregnant. But the
white-bread whites, Will and Becca Marek (Matthew Letscher and
Melinda McGraw), point out that they were the models for the cover.
Oops, it turns out there was just a little too much toner in the
fax machine.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cookes are here, they've bought the house, and they're
going to make the best of it. As Will says when he first glimpses
them next door, ``A little ethnicity will do everyone some good.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Carmine Santucci (Lenny Venito) spies the Cookes, he
takes a look at the contents of the moving van and says: ``They've
got a lot of books. It's going to be trouble.'' Before the premiere
episode is over, Carmine, who actually has a black lawn jockey
outside his house, will have accused the Cookes of stealing his
Char-Wizard barbecue. And Will will have realized that doing a
morning run with Curtis reminds him of the time he was chased by a
black man who robbed him.
</P>
<P>
   But it cuts both ways, folks. ``That's the sound of our property
values dropping 20 percent,'' says Carmine when he gets a good look
at the Cookes. ``Great, there go our property values,'' says
Tamara, when she and Curtis get a good look at Carmine's mammoth
recreational vehicle parked outside the house.
</P>
<P>
   The second episode of ``Living in Captivity'' focuses on each
couple's curiosity about how often the other couples have sex. In a
subplot, Carmine's young blond size-4 wife, Lisa (Mia Cottet), who
seems to spend most of her time on exercise machines, decides to
take a class, forcing Carmine _ whose manhood would apparently be
compromised by pushing a button on a microwave _ to have dinner at
the other couples' houses. ``So,'' he says to the Cookes, ``this is
okra.''
</P>
<P>
   The third episode is about a robbery, which results in the
nervous breakdown of Gordon the security guard and security-alarm
jokes. The subplot is about the Cookes' new baby, who ``hasn't
stopped crying since he was born.'' And while everyone is trying to
make the neighborhood safer, two dogs _ one (named Gambino) small,
white and fluffy; one of the seeing-eye variety _ meet untimely
(off camera) ends. Can they do that in prime time?

   His head covered with a yarmulke, Steven Spielberg toured the
former Sachsenhausen concentration camp in Germany on Wednesday, a
day before he was to receive a national medal of merit from
President Roman Herzog of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg, whose Academy Award-winning 1993 film ``Schindler's
List'' dealt with the Holocaust, spent 45 minutes touring
Sachsenhausen, where some 100,000 Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals and
political opponents of the Nazis died from 1936 to 1945. He said he
was moved by his visit but heartened to see many young people from
nearby Berlin and elsewhere in Germany touring the camp, which has
been preserved as a memorial. In the guest book, he wrote,
``Remembrance, honesty, the future _ we must tell of this.''

WIFE OF DISSIDENT IS DETAINED BEFORE U.N. COMMISSIONER'S SPEECH 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Security agents dragged the wife of a jailed dissident
through the lobby of the Hilton Hotel here Wednesday morning and
detained her, moments before the visiting U.N. human rights
commissioner gave a speech in a nearby room on democracy and
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The dissident's wife, Chu Hailan, was standing outside the
hotel, witnesses said, waiting for a chance to ask the commissioner
to press the case of her husband, Liu Nianchun. A labor rights
campaigner, Liu, 50, has been imprisoned for more than three years
without trial and his wife has sought medical parole, citing his
high blood pressure and other ailments.
</P>
<P>
   But plainclothes police and hotel security guards grabbed Ms.
Chu and bundled her, screaming, through the lobby. She was held in
a hotel security room, then taken to a local police station. Ms.
Chu was freed eight hours after she was first detained.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Robinson, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights,
later told reporters that she was deeply concerned when she learned
about the incident and raised it with Vice Foreign Minister Wang
Guangya, who assured her Ms. Chu had been released.
</P>
<P>
   Later the official New China News Agency quoted a Foreign
Ministry spokesman as saying, ``Security guards removed a woman
from the entrance of the Hilton Hotel because she was disturbing
order at the hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   In her 10-day visit to China, Robinson aims to build a
constructive working relationship with Chinese officials and nudge
the country toward better safeguards for individual rights.
</P>
<P>
   China has pledged to sign the International Covenant on Civil
and Political Rights this fall. That document guarantees freedoms
of assembly and speech, which are often violated here in the name
of social order and national security.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Earlier this year the United States secured China's agreement to
sign the covenant in exchange for ending the annual pursuit of a
resolution before the U.N. Human Rights Commission condemning
China's record. Diplomats argued that by joining the treaty, China
would subject itself to regular assessments by outside experts, a
more effective wedge for change than hostile debates in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   But once China signs, it could be years before it ratifies the
treaty and Chinese officials have said they will file reservations
for any sections that are inconsistent with Chinese law.
</P>
<P>
   In her visit, which began last weekend, Robinson has publicly
pressed China to sign the covenant soon. She has met with Chinese
legal experts and justice officials, members of the
government-sponsored Women's Federation and officials in charge of
policy on ethnic minorities. But government officials have made it
clear that she is not expected to meet with any of the country's
beleaguered dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Robinson left for Tibet, where China is accused of
using harsh methods to suppress support for the exiled Dalai Lama.
Next Monday, back in Beijing, she is expected to meet with
President Jiang Zemin, who is also the Communist Party chief.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's talk Wednesday morning at the Hilton Hotel coincided
with the release of a U.N. report on human development in China. In
the speech she said that ``China can be commended for efforts to
eliminate poverty and to meet the basic needs of all.''
</P>
<P>
   But she also said: ``The right to development expresses a
fundamental value predicated upon respect for all human rights,
whether civil, cultural, economic, political or social, together as
an integrated whole. None of these can be fully realized without
democratic governance and the rule of law.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Procedure lets couple pick sex of their child
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Couples have a much better chance of picking the sex of their
children through a new procedure developed in a Virginia fertility
clinic that weighs the genetic material of sperm, according to a
study released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure, developed by the Genetics &AMP; IVF Institute, based
in Fairfax, Va., has had an 85 percent success rate in selecting
girls and a 65 percent rate of success in selecting boys, according
to a paper published Wednesday in the journal Human Reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely exciting,'' said Dr. Edward Fugger, director of
the institute's micro-sort division. ``It's definitely one of the
bigger things we've done in recent years.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the advancement raises questions about the ethics of
the procedure and whether it could shift the population balance of
men and women, some doctors and medical ethicists said Wednesday
that the good far outweighs the bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorting sperm is far better than leaving babies on the
hillside,'' said Arthur Caplan, director of the Center of Bioethics
and professor at the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ``For once, I don't think this is a bad thing. This is another
case where earlier is better.''
</P>
<P>
   The procedure works by sorting the sperm by analyzing the weight
of its DNA. Sperm with the X chromosome, which produces girls,
contains about 2.8 percent more DNA than sperm with the Y
chromosome, which produces boys. The Virginia institute's technique
allows male- and female-producing sperm to be sorted before being
used to fertilize an egg and implanted. Right now, the Virginia
institute is running clinical trials on the procedure and is the
only place couples can go for the procedure. Since the trials
began, the institute said of 14 pregnancies that progressed far
enough for doctors to determine the fetus' sex, 13 had female
fetuses. Ten out of the 11 babies that were born so far were girls.
Institute officials said the group has produced about the same
number of pregnancies for couples who wanted boys.
</P>
<P>
   But others _ including Reproductive Biology Associates Inc. of
Atlanta _ say they are extremely interested in the technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``This allows us to stack the gun without many of the moral or
ethical problems we've faced in the past,'' said Andrew Toledo, an
RBA fertility specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Toledo said, many couples ask the clinic to pick
an embryo _ out of a handful conceived through fertility treatments
_ not solely on the basis of health, but also by sex. ``That's a
huge no-no,'' he said, and something RBA has traditionally refused
to do.
</P>
<P>
   The new procedure would eliminate such quandaries. This allows a
couple the chance to determine the sex of their child, with no harm
done, Caplan said.
</P>
<P>
   And in many cases, selecting sperm has positive medical
implications. For example, most hemophiliacs are men. If a couple
knows the disease runs in the family, they can improve their odds
of dodging the illness by selecting sperm that would produce a
girl, Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, couples who are seeking to avoid sex-linked diseases
are one of two categories the institute is seeking for its clinical
trials. The other category is couples trying to balance their
families, said Fugger. In the past three years, Fugger said, the
institute has had thousands of couples call and inquire about the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   The sperm sorting costs couples $1,600, but there are additional
charges for having intrauterine insemination or in vitro
fertilization, he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Fugger said the institute hopes to make the technology
readily available within a couple of years. And depending on
improvements in the machinery, the price could go up or down.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some other procedures, sperm sorting is especially
labor-intensive, taking almost a day for the institute to sort
through an estimated 200 million sperm.
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of time, some couples have tried to control
whether they have sons or daughters. From infanticide to feticide,
methods have been used to eliminate unwanted girls and boys.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, girls are the losers. In countries that impose a
one-child rule, for example, girls have been killed, eliminated in
the womb or abandoned. And critics say that gender bias could get
worse - especially if it only took a simple test of
</P>
<P>
   sperm to determine a boy or a girl.
</P>
<P>
   But Caplan said he does not agree that the technology should be
stopped because of these concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very leery of the argument that individuals shouldn't be
allowed to make their own reproductive decisions because of a
greater societal good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   I think that starts us down a slippery slope we really don't
want to travel.

   ``They do a little bit of everything,'' A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum
said. ``They do a lot of things on offense, and they know what
they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs are 0-2. They opened with a 56-27 loss at Nebraska
and then lost at home to Central Florida, 64-30, Saturday. In the
two games, quarterback Tim Rattay has thrown for 1,118 yards and
seven touchdowns while wide receiver Troy Edwards has 34 receptions
for 611 yards and five touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Central Florida coach Mike Kruczek believes that the key to
slowing the Bulldogs' attack is fighting variety with variety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nebraska really had a vanilla, basic game plan against them,''
he said. ``We felt that one of the keys was to get as much pressure
on Rattay as possible. We felt that it was crucial to try as many
things on defense as we could. We changed up our defenses, our
coverages, our blitzes as much as we could to try to confuse
them.''
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M is 0-1, having lost to Florida State in the Kickoff Classic
on Aug. 31. In that game, the Aggies allowed the second-ranked
Seminoles to gain 153 yards on the ground. And Florida State wide
receiver Peter Warrick finished with nine catches for 106 yards.
</P>
<P>
   That leads Slocum to believe that Louisiana Tech is a hazardous
opponent. He believes that Edwards is the most dangerous receiver
A&AMP;M has faced. And, he feels Edwards is particularly potent because
he has a capable quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   However, Slocum says that the attention that Edwards received
for his record-setting day (405 receiving yards) against Nebraska
should help the Aggies prepare.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have tremendous respect for Nebraska and for Louisiana Tech
to put up the numbers they did up there, that gets your attention
in a hurry,'' said Slocum, whose secondary is still a work in
progress. ``There's not question, that helps us in terms of
motivation. That verifies how good they are.''

 SEN. BOXER TRIES TO CARVE OUT MIDDLE GROUND ON (For use bLINTON-HNS   y New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A day after scolding President Clinton, Sen.
Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., on Wednesday insisted that she was not
ratcheting up her criticism of the president in the face of a stiff
election challenge from California state treasurer Matt Fong.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer also said she has asked Clinton to campaign for her in
California before the Nov. 3 election.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to reporters' questions about whether her new
criticism of Clinton was motivated by electoral considerations,
Boxer insisted that she had consistently criticized Clinton since
his Aug. 17 televised address in which he acknowledged a sexual
relationship with Monica Lewinsky after seven months of denying it.
</P>
<P>
   The only new element, she said, was her use of the word
``immoral'' to describe the president's relationship with Lewinsky,
who joined the White House as an intern when she was 21 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spoken about this many times, endless times, more times
than I've spoken about almost anything else,'' said Boxer, a
longtime Clinton stalwart whose daughter Nicole is married to First
Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's brother, Tony Rodham.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer described Clinton's behavior as ``a bad thing. There's not
anything you can do to change the fact that it's a bad, immoral
relationship. I wish it never happened. I'm sure he does too.''
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton's Aug. 17 speech, Boxer's colleague, Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, D-Calif., issued a stinging rebuke, saying her trust in
Clinton had been ``badly shattered.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Boxer adopted a more measured tone, saying
``there's no question his moral authority, in terms of his private
life, has been eroded.'' At the same time, Boxer said, ``people are
still saying they approve of his policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to explain the differing reactions between Feinstein and
her, Boxer recalled that both she and Feinstein were at the White
House Jan. 26 when Clinton waved his finger and angrily denied a
sexual relationship with ``that woman, Miss Lewinsky.'' Clinton
also said that ``not a single time'' had he asked anyone to lie.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein, Boxer said, ``felt the president was talking to her
directly. I didn't take it that way. I respect her for that. But I
didn't take it that he was talking to me personally.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``That's life. That's how people respond in different
ways. I don't think you could get any more strong about the
behavior than I've gotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Wednesday, Feinstein issued a statement responding to
Boxer and delivery of the long-awaited report of Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr to Capitol Hill: ``I think right now its
premature for me to make any further statements until we have a
chance to review the Starr report.''
</P>
<P>
   In a election season debate last month, Fong criticized Boxer
about the White House sex scandal, saying that her ``silence on
this issue is deafening.''
</P>
<P>
   Fong and Boxer are neck-and-neck in the polls. A poll conducted
between Aug. 21 and Sept. 2 by pollster Richard Hertz showed 40
percent favoring Boxer, 36 percent for Fong and 22 percent
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer told reporters that she does not believe that fallout over
Clinton's affair with Lewinsky has had any direct impact on her
re-election bid.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, she said, people urge her to speak out
about issues such as fixing schools, abortion rights, gun control
and reining in managed care health plans. Her views on these
issues, she added, are ``in sync'' with those of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   However, she added, ``to the extent that nobody seems to print
anything except the Monica story, it hurts me.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer drew a distinction between Clinton's public policymaking
role as president, and his private life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have confidence in his private morality,'' she said.
``But I have confidence in his public policy. I'll work with him on
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is scheduled to make a series of appearances with
Boxer on Sept. 25, Boxer said. Clinton also will campaign for Boxer
in October, although no dates have been firmed up, she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel it's my obligation to work with this president,'' she
said, giving Clinton credit for pulling California out of the
recession of the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democratic candidates such as Maryland Gov. Parris
Glendening have declined opportunities to have Clinton make
campaign and fundraising appearances with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are hard things to decide,'' Boxer said. ``I respect
people who make that decision. In my case, I've laid out why I
think it's good for me and good for my constituents to work with
this president.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Boxer said, she doubted whether her race against
Fong would turn on Clinton's behavior with Lewinsky. With her
television ads about to hit the airwaves in California, she said,
voters would soon be able to draw distinctions between her liberal
record on issues such as abortion and gun control and Fong's
conservative approach to those issues.
</P>
<P>
   Voters are unlikely to go to the polls saying ``I agree with her
on choice, on the environment, on guns, but I'll vote for Matt Fong
because I'm mad at Bill Clinton,'' she said. ``I don't think it's
logical.''

<P>
   In Congress, Boxer has been a stalwart on women's rights and
sexual harassment. She was among the women House members who
marched over to the Senate side of the Capitol in 1991 and demanded
that senators take seriously Anita Hill's allegations of sexual
harassment against then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, she criticized the Navy for permitting Chief of Naval
Operations Adm. Frank Kelso to retire with four stars because he
had attended the 1991 Tailhook convention, where raucous aviators
publicly molested women.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1995, Boxer was in the forefront of Senate Ethics
Committee proceedings against then Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Oregon for
fondling and groping female employees and acquaintances.

PICASSO'S `WEEPING' DORA: HER COLLECTION, UP FOR AUCTION, TELLS FAR
MORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Pablo Picasso's reputation for wrecking the lives of the
women who loved him was in no small measure shaped by the way he
treated Dora Maar, the Surrealist photographer who was his mistress
and muse for nine years until he dropped her for the younger
Francoise Gilot in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that he used her as the model for his ``Weeping Woman''
portraits only added to her aura of tragedy. He even persuaded
himself that she was the weeping woman. ``I could never see her,
never imagine her, except crying,'' he once remarked.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, in the decades that followed their separation, Ms.
Maar embraced to the full her role of jilted paramour. She suffered
frequent bouts of depression, spoke bitterly of Picasso's cruelty,
turned to religion and in the end became a recluse.
</P>
<P>
   Yet she never broke free from Picasso. She turned her Left Bank
apartment into a shrine to their affair, filled with relics in the
shape of paintings, drawings, books, photographs, sculptures,
jewelry and tiny carvings that he made for her. It was, she told
friends, her ``private museum.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time she died in a Paris hospital on July 16, 1997, at
the age of 89, she had become a long-forgotten footnote in the life
of a great artist who had himself died 24 years earlier. It was 10
days before Le Monde even discovered and announced her demise. Many
who knew her place in Picasso's biography were surprised she had
lived so long. Only a handful of friends attended her funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if overlooked in the second half of her life, Ms. Maar has
awakened great interest in death because she left one of the last
important Picasso collections still in private hands outside the
artist's immediate family.
</P>
<P>
   Its 10 paintings, which were cataloged in the late 1940s,
include seven portraits of Ms. Maar, including one of four known
oils of her as a ``Weeping Woman.'' The drawings are also mainly
portraits of Ms. Maar, including the passionately erotic, large
colored work ``Dora Maar and the Minotaur.'' Scores of anecdotal
objects, like tiny portraits carved on pebbles or painted on tiny
medallions, make the collection even more unusual and personal.
Taken together, the works assume an almost anthropological
character.
</P>
<P>
   While breaking no new ground on Picasso the artist, they do
throw fresh light on Picasso the man. Even as he continued to see
an earlier mistress, Marie-Therese Walter, he was announcing his
love for Ms. Maar through his art. Paintings like ``Dora on a
Beach,'' where her hair blows wildly in the wind, and drawings like
``Portrait of Dora Maar Asleep'' show a warmth and tenderness
toward the beautiful dark-eyed photographer that bear no
resemblance to how he chose to remember her years later.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, after Ms. Maar's death, the unsentimental question
that really interested the art world was what would become of the
collection. The answer was unclear. Born Theodora Markovitch in
Tours in 1907, Ms. Maar never married, had no children or apparent
heirs and left no will. If no heirs could be traced, everything she
owned would revert to the French government.
</P>
<P>
   In France, however, genealogists make a business of finding
heirs when no one comes forward to claim a legacy. Having traced a
relative through birth and death records, they disclose the
existence of an inheritance but offer no details until a contract
is signed guaranteeing them a reward. Their cut varies from 15
percent to 40 percent of the value of the estate, depending on the
family relationship and the sum of money involved. But without
them, the heirs would get nothing and the government would get all.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Ms. Maar, whose mother was French and whose
father, a Paris-based architect, was from the Balkan region that
later became Yugoslavia, two genealogists each found a distant
relative, one in France and one in the former Yugoslavia. Neither
heir has been identified, but their claims have been sufficiently
proved before notaries to permit the selection of two French
auction houses, Piasa and Jean-Jacques Mathias, to oversee the sale
of Ms. Maar's entire estate this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Picassos of Dora Maar'' auction is to be held in the
Maison de la Chimie in Paris on Oct. 27, 28 and 29, with the most
valuable part of the 143-lot collection _ the 10 paintings and 50
drawings _ to be offered Oct. 27. Some 58 items from this
collection will be exhibited in New York at the Phillips Fine Art
Auctioneers and Appraisers at 406 East 79th St. on Sept. 26, 27 and
28. Three subsequent auctions at the Hotel Drouot in Paris on Nov.
20 and 26 and on Dec. 7 will handle Ms. Maar's own photographs,
drawings, paintings and furniture.
</P>
<P>
   The Picasso works alone are expected to fetch more than $25
million, although 60 percent will go to the French government in
death duty before the genealogists take their share, which in this
case is expected to be 35 percent to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was not rich, but she sold nothing,'' said Lucien Solanet,
a partner in Piasa. ``That's why we have everything. If we were
selling 10 paintings, it would not be the same as selling an entire
slice of life between 1936 and 1945. It's like a time capsule.''
</P>
<P>
   Last October, Francois Lorenceau, an expert hired to appraise
the collection, was in the first group to visit Ms. Maar's
apartment at 6 Rue de Savoie since her death. Picasso's paintings
and drawings had been removed to a bank vault for safekeeping
before the apartment was sealed in July 1997, but nothing else had
been touched.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only her body had been taken out,'' he recalled, ``but
everything was there, a frying pan, her slippers, her medicine. She
had many religious objects, like prayer books and crosses. There
were lots of empty suitcases. In her studio, there were cans of
paint, brushes and canvases. Her own paintings were still there.
There was a cupboard full of books and photographs. It looked like
a very crowded workplace.''
</P>
<P>
   The Picasso collection has now been organized: The paintings and
drawings, which had been kept in large folders, have been framed
and in many cases given names (``Head of a Woman,'' for example,
has become ``Dora Maar with Green Fingernails''); and all the
scraps of paper, stones, bones, cheap rings, bits of wood and the
like that Picasso turned into art have been photographed and
classified. Seen together during a recent visit to Piasa's office
and a nearby bank vault, the collection has the coherence of a
tightly wrapped memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's important to me is that no matter the quality of the
piece, you feel the emotion in the work,'' said Marc Blondeau, a
Paris-based art broker who was hired as a consultant by the two
French auction houses. ``They're full of feeling, full of life.''
</P>
<P>
   That Ms. Maar herself should be remembered only in relation to
Picasso, however, is unjust to someone who had made her name as a
photographer in the Surrealist movement well before the January
evening in 1936 when poet Paul Eluard introduced her to Picasso at
the Deux Magots cafe in St.-Germain-des-Pres. At 55, the artist was
26 years her senior, but they became lovers six months later and
soon afterward Ms. Maar found Picasso a new studio on the Rue des
Grands Augustins, around the corner from her own apartment.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It is also a twist of history that Ms. Maar's own personality
should be so identified with the ``Weeping Woman'' portraits. One
thing that brought her close to Picasso was that she had been
raised in Argentina and spoke Spanish. When the Spanish Civil War
erupted in 1936, she shared his anguish. As a member of the French
Communist Party, she influenced his politics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1937, when Picasso was preparing his antiwar masterpiece,
``Guernica,'' inspired by German aerial bombing of the Spanish
Basque town of the same name, Ms. Maar not only photographed him at
work but also served as his model for a mourning woman in tears.
Yet at that time, as works in this collection confirm, their own
relationship was blooming.
</P>
<P>
   They remained companions and lovers well after the German
occupation of Paris in June 1940. While Picasso is said to have
become disturbed by her dark moods by 1942, 40 powerful drawings
done by him in a new edition of the animal stories by an
18th-century naturalist writer known only as Buffon one afternoon
in January 1943 suggest that she remained his muse. By 1944,
though, Ms. Gilot had entered his life and, over a painful and
stormy few months, Ms. Maar was displaced.
</P>
<P>
   Picasso and Ms. Gilot in fact attended the opening of a show of
Ms. Maar's paintings in 1945 (it was Picasso who had encouraged her
to switch from photography to painting). Picasso also sent her a
1937 pencil portrait of her to mark her birthday on Nov. 22, 1950.
It is thought that the last time they met was at a social event in
1954. But by then, by many accounts, the Picasso of her shrine
seemed more real than the living artist. And in that shrine, she
still had a place.
</P>
<P>
   In 1953, when she asked the young American writer James Lord to
guess the value of the Picasso paintings in her apartment, she even
seemed to anticipate the expectation stirred today by the coming
auction of her collection. In his 1993 memoir ``Picasso and Dora,''
Lord recalled Ms. Maar's scoffing at his estimate of half a million
dollars as they drove through nighttime Paris. And he went on:
</P>
<P>
   ```Much more,' she said, gesturing emphatically with the
cigarette holder, scattering ash across the dashboard. `And I'll
tell you why. Because they're mine. On the walls of a gallery,
maybe they're worth only half a million. On the walls of Picasso's
mistress, they're worth a premium, the premium of history.'''

 By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The road to oblivion was an easy one for filmmaker
Milton Moses Ginsberg. ``Merely make a movie that's murder on the
audience,'' he once wrote. ``It wasn't difficult for me. I
positively aspired to the obscure, the pretentious and the
boring.''
</P>
<P>
   The film that hurled Ginsberg into oblivion was ``Coming
Apart,'' a 110-minute black-and-white drama shot in 1969 from
essentially one camera angle, about the psychic and sexual
disintegration of a psychiatrist played by Rip Torn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming Apart,'' Ginsberg's first feature, has long been a
favorite with serious filmmakers. Scholarly essays have been
written about it. But it is almost impossible to see. It never went
to video, and it is almost never screened.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ginsberg says he cannot bear to look at ``Coming Apart.''
Last spring, when it was shown at the Museum of Modern Art for the
first time in 15 years, the filmmaker, nervous and fearful, walked
into the auditorium only at the end of the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't tolerate looking at it,'' he said. ``When you
reach into your own soul ....'' Ginsberg left the sentence
unfinished. Then he added, ``I looked in there, and I don't want to
look again.'' Audiences will have a rare opportunity to take a
look, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming Apart'' is to be shown again at the museum Monday at 6
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is very much in the diary tradition of late '60s
filmmaking, grainy and harshly lit, giving the illusion of
unfiltered reality. It is also about the process of filmmaking
itself, with what appear to be jump cuts, leaders left in and
``unposed'' moments between takes, although every minute of the
film was scripted.
</P>
<P>
   Filmed in three weeks on a budget of $60,000, ``Coming Apart''
is the story of a philandering psychiatrist, Dr. Glazer (Torn,
notably younger and slimmer), whose mistress has left him. He rents
an apartment in her Kips Bay building under an assumed name,
Glassman, and proceeds to record his rapidly disintegrating life
with a camera hidden in a mirrored box.
</P>
<P>
   During the course of the film, he is visited by an assortment of
women, including one dressed in an S&AMP;M costume; his pregnant wife,
whom he hopes to leave; his former mistress, played by Viveca
Lindfors, and a former patient, played by Sally Kirkland. There is
also an orgy scene in which a ``woman'' is revealed to be a
transvestite.
</P>
<P>
   Ginsberg, who was in his early 30s when he made ``Coming
Apart,'' _ he does not give his exact age, saying only that he is
``the same age as Warren and Woody,'' who are in their 60s _ based
it on an experience of breaking up with a girlfriend and then
running into her with another man. He became so jealous, he said,
that he moved into her apartment building. ``Everything is glass,''
Ginsberg said of ``Coming Apart.'' ``The mirror is glass, his life
is glass.''
</P>
<P>
   After finishing ``Coming Apart,'' Ginsberg waited for something
to happen. Richard Schickel in Life magazine called the film ``one
of the few illuminating _ not to say harrowing _ portrayals of a
schizophrenic crackup that I have ever seen on the screen.'' But
Andrew Sarris wrote in The Village Voice that ``if everybody in the
cast had refused to strip for action or inaction, `Coming Apart'
would have crumbled commercially into a half-baked amateur movie
incapable of selling enough tickets to fill a phone booth.''
</P>
<P>
   The day Sarris' review was published, audiences stopped going to
the theaters, Ginsberg recalled: ``That was it. No agents called. I
had done everything I wanted to do. And nothing happened.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason the movie failed, Ginsberg said, is the raw sexual
content and nudity. In an interview, Torn said: ``It was just ahead
of its time. It looks kind of chaste now. I think it was not
merchandised correctly. They put it in the kind of houses where
people thought there was going to be a sex experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Some who saw the film thought the sex was real, but Torn denied
that. ``It was very well-chaperoned,'' he said. ``I was given a
dinner party by all the women in which they had a medal cast for
me,'' because he had been entirely professional.
</P>
<P>
   After the failure of ``Coming Apart,'' Ginsberg made only one
feature film, ``The Werewolf of Washington,'' in 1973. He calls it
a political satire, conceived during the Watergate era as an
indictment of President Richard M. Nixon. ``Werewolf'' starred Dean
Stockwell as a John Dean-like character who turned into a werewolf
at night.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Ginsberg has earned his living primarily working on
documentary films, including two Academy Award winners, ``Down and
Out in America'' (1986) and ``Educating Peter'' (1993).
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate it so much I don't do it,'' he said of the work.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, Ginsberg was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; he
experienced remissions after surgery and chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the illness, I went into a long depression,'' he said.
He led ``the life of `Coming Apart,''' he said, until he met Nina
Polansky, a painter. They married in 1983. ``She changed my life,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Ginsberg has lived in obscurity. ``I have not
been interviewed in 30 years,'' he said, with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   But every now and then, he said, he runs into someone who
recognizes him as the man who made ``Coming Apart.'' Eight or nine
years ago, a scout from the Cannes Film Festival remembered the
film. ``It's an extraordinary feeling,'' Ginsberg said. ``I can't
tell you what that meant. It was like he was saying to me, `You're
capable.' In effect, it's saying, `You can do this again.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ginsberg is making a one-hour video, ``City Below the Line,'' a
contemporary version of Dostoevsky's ``Notes From the
Underground.'' It is about a film editor who meets a woman whom he
pursues and then abandons. It is being produced on a budget of
$2,000, with Ginsberg, his wife and friends as actors. He has
borrowed an editing room from a friend. Ginsberg said he planned to
show it to the scout from Cannes who recognized him.
</P>
<P>
   Ginsberg said that when ``Coming Apart'' was screened at the
Museum of Modern Art last spring, a man in the audience, who had
seen it when it was first released, stood up and said it was even
more relevant today than it was 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `You shouldn't feel because it was not a commercial
success that you were a failure,''' Ginsberg remembered. ``I said,
`Thank you.' But it's very difficult not to feel that way.''

   EURASIA-AUTOSCAM (South Portland, Maine) _ When Howard Patterson
strode to the podium here last month, he was applauded wildly by
several dozen car dealers, each of whom had paid from $25,000 to
$60,000 to acquire a franchise for the fledgling Eurasia Motor
Corp. of Fort Lauderdale, Fla. For 18 months, the dealers had seen
nothing but pictures of a quickly changing mix of vehicles, but
now, they thought, they were moments away from the real thing. Not

   EURASIA-AUTOSCAM (South Portland, Maine) _ When Howard Patterson
strode to the podium here last month, he was applauded wildly by
several dozen car dealers, each of whom had paid from $25,000 to
$60,000 to acquire a franchise for the fledgling Eurasia Motor
Corp. of Fort Lauderdale, Fla. For 18 months, the dealers had seen
nothing but pictures of a quickly changing mix of vehicles, but
now, they thought, they were moments away from the real thing. Not
that every Eurasia dealer had waited patiently. ``I think it was a
scam from the very beginning,'' said Chuck Pond, owner of Action
Automotive in Mobile, Ala., who is one of at least nine dealers who

CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM BACKERS LOOK TO D'AMATO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the Senate poised to vote Thursday on a
last-ditch effort to overhaul the nation's campaign finance system,
supporters are hoping a longtime foe will help save the engandered
measure.
</P>
<P>
   New York Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato is one of eight Republican
senators, including Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, who have been
targets of advertising campaigns aimed at persuading them to drop
their opposition to the overhaul plan and help send the bill to
President Clinton for his signature.
</P>
<P>
   Yet D'Amato, one of the nation's most prodigious fund-raisers,
is considered a key to the measure's destiny because other
reluctant senators could follow his lead if he supports the
high-stakes plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a major party fund-raiser from a big state, Al D'Amato
could be the one to change the dynamic,'' said Ann McBride,
executive director of Common Cause. ``It would make a huge
difference if he voted with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the overhaul plan passed the House last month, 252-179,
in a major setback for Speaker Newt Gingrich, the measure has died
twice in the Senate in the last year when a slim majority
supporting the bill fell eight votes short of mustering the
three-fifths majority needed to end GOP filibusters.
</P>
<P>
   If the plan's backers have any hope of breaking another
Republican filibuster, D'Amato, Gregg and several other GOP
senators would need to shift their position.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, who has already raised more than $21 million for his
reelection effort, said he has not ruled out voting for the
overhaul plan. But he said he would do so only if the measure is
altered.
</P>
<P>
   ``More work needs to be done on it,'' D'Amato said. ``If they
accomplish some changes, it might be meaningful, but not now.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, none of the eight targeted senators _ or the other 40
who voted twice before to block the overhaul plan _ has yet to
publicly announce a change of heart. The other targeted senators,
all Republicans, are the majority leader, Trent Lott of
Mississippi; Richard Lugar of Indiana; Mike DeWine of Ohio; Lauch
Faircloth of North Carolina; Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado;
and Christopher S. Bond of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they change the plan, I might take another look,'' said
Faircloth, who is mired in a difficult reelection race. ``But my
problem with it is where it is headed, which is clearly to use
taxpayer dollars to pay for campaigns. I can't see myself
supporting that.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, sponsored by Senators John McCain, an Arizona
Republican, and Russell Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat, would ban
the unlimited, largely unregulated contributions known as ``soft
money,'' which were associated with most of the abuses stemming
from the 1996 elections. The plan also would regulate issue
advertising by independent groups and require stricter disclosure
of campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said the measure was vital to restore flagging public
trust in elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington lately has become synonymous with scandal,'' McCain
said. ``But for all the recent scintillating revelations, the real
scandal, the scandal that will not go away, is the money that is
corrupting our elections. Unless the Senate finds the courage to
act, the scandal will not subside.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican who has dubbed
himself the Darth Vader of campaign finance legislation as the
leading opponent of change, said he believes he will maintain at
least the 41 votes he needs to prevent the plan's passage.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bill's remarkable success in the House, McConnell
said, ``We are hoping to demonstrate that there has been no
movement since February,'' when the Senate last killed the measure.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell, who heads the Senate Republican fund-raising effort,
said he opposes the overhaul plan because its ban on soft-money
contributions and restrictions on some advertising violate
free-speech rights.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats, united in support of the measure, vowed to
continue pressing for the overhaul if they lose Thursday's vote.

REPUBLICAN EFFORT TO OVERHAUL BANKRUPTCY LAWS APPEARS DOOMED

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An effort to overhaul bankruptcy laws appears
doomed as Republicans and Democrats remained sharply divided
Wednesday over how to deal with the soaring number of consumers who
get protection from creditors.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, sponsor of legislation that
would require judges to consider a person's ability to repay at
least some debts before excusing liabilities, said his bill would
``screen out those who want to avoid debts they can afford to
pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Grassley told the Senate that businesses lost about $40 billion
last year as a result of bankruptcy, amounting to ``a hidden tax of
$400 per family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something must be done to curb a skyrocketing rate of
bankruptcies that reached an all time high last year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A record 1.35 million consumer bankruptcies were filed in 1997,
and 361,908 were filed in the second quarter of 1998, the most ever
reported in a three-month period, according to the Administrative
Office of the U.S. Courts.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans are expected to fall short of the 60 votes
needed to overcome Democratic opposition to the bill. A vote could
come as early as Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., has said that if the
vote failed, ``that will be it for the year.''
</P>
<P>
   .MDNM/Sen. Richard Durbin, a co-sponsor of the legislation, said
``it is in its heart a good bill'' but that it still needs changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should call on the credit card companies to accept more
responsibility,'' said Durbin, D-Ill. He added that many credit
companies solicit people who are ``too young or mentally
incompetent'' receive cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time and time again a lot of people take these credit cards
and then get more deeply in debt,'' Durbin said. ``You almost have
to shove (credit card companies) away from the mailbox.''
</P>
<P>
   Durbin said credit card companies should be required to say on
the monthly statement how long it will take to pay off the balance
if you make the minimum payment. ``It will give a person a sobering
message,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As households get deeper into credit card and other unsecured
consumer debt, Durbin said, ``they become more vulnerable'' to
personal bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   He said the average person filing for bankruptcy has an annual
income of $17,652, and that the average debt is about $28,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people making less than $10 an hour,'' Durbin said.
``They are not the fat cats, the ones who go to canny attorneys.''
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 306-188 in June to approve an overhaul of the
bankruptcy laws.
</P>
<P>
   Both the House and Senate bills seek to shift some debtors from
Chapter 7 bankruptcies into Chapter 13.
</P>
<P>
   Under Chapter 7, a consumer is able to discharge much unsecured
debt, such as credit card or medical bills, within a few months. To
do so, a debtor must liquidate assets and pay what he or she can to
creditors. Under Chapter 13, a debtor commits to repay at least a
portion of the debt with future earnings over three to five years.
</P>
<P>
   Arrangements for repaying secured debt, such as loans for a car
or a house, are typically made separately.
</P>
<P>
   On the Senate floor Tuesday, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman
Orrin G. Hatch, who favors the bankruptcy bill, said unnecessary
consumer bankruptcies harm small business owners, senior citizens
who rely on rental income, and members of credit unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some people who can pay all of what they owe but opt
out through the bankruptcy system because of current loopholes in
the law itself,'' said Hatch, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee approved Grassley's bill 16-2 in June.

<P>
   Dr. Harrie Rogers Chamberlin, a pediatrician and educator who
was a member of the President's Advisory Committee on Mental
Retardation during the Kennedy administration, died of cancer Aug.
31 in his home in Chapel Hill, N.C. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Chamberlin specialized in pediatric neurology with an
emphasis on deviations from normal development, such as mental
retardation. In 1953, he joined the newly formed department of
pediatrics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He
was director of the school's division for disorders of development
and learning from 1962 until his retirement in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Cambridge, Mass., he graduated from Harvard College and
Harvard Medical School before serving in the Army during World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   Practicing what he called ``citizen diplomacy,'' as he wrote in
the 50th annual report of his class at Harvard, he was a member of
Physicians for Social Responsibility and International Physicians
for the Prevention of Nuclear War.
</P>
<P>
   Through membership in the groups, he wrote, ``one's perspective
of the problems that all of us face is greatly expanded, and one
feels as much a citizen of the world as one does of one's own
country.''
</P>
<P>
   He enjoyed hiking, climbing, and camping, and visited all the
continents except Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this context, my own profession, training, and research in
the area of child development is a rewarding field,'' he wrote.
``One is reminded of a passage attributed to Socrates: `If I could
get to the highest place in Athens, I would lift my voice and say,
`what mean you, fellow citizens, that you turn every stone to
scrape wealth together, and take so little care of your children,
to whom you must one day relinquish all?'''
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Betsy Inches; three daughters, Elizabeth
Ayer, Sarah Eden, and Ann Farwell; a son, Robert C.; two sisters,
Sarah Eden Cook of Sheffield, Mass. and Elizabeth Chamberlin of
Cambridge; and three grandchildren.

JAPAN'S CENTRAL BANK REDUCES RATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Japan's central bank, apparently seeking to appease an
international community urging action on the country's deepening
banking crisis, reduced interest rates for the first time in three
years.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected move Wednesday by Bank of Japan trimmed the
target interest rate for overnight loans between banks to 0.25
percent from an already low 0.5 percent to inject liquidity into a
system of crippled banks, many of them near collapse. The rate is
the equivalent to the US federal funds rate.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of Japan acted ``to maintain the stability of the
financial markets,'' said the central bank's governor, Masaru
Hayami. ``The restoration of the financial system, along with
economic recovery, are priorities that can't be delayed any
longer.''
</P>
<P>
   That statement is precisely what western leaders want to hear
from policy makers in Tokyo. But some economists viewed the tiny
rate cut as a poor substitute for other, more effective measures
that have stalled in Parliament, including a stimulative program of
tax cuts to spur economic growth and a much-needed banking reform
plan to repair a troubled industry.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, the world's second-largest economy, has a total of $1
trillion in troubled loans in its banking system, according to one
estimate.
</P>
<P>
   The rate reduction ``is a sign of the lack of progress in fiscal
programs,'' said Richard Marston, professor of international
finance at the Wharton School of business at the University of
Pennsylvania. ``It looks like the Bank of Japan is just desperately
doing what it can do without parliamentary approval.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of Japan, like this country's Federal Reserve Board, is
a relatively independent organization unfettered by politics,
though it faces internal pressure from a troubled banking sector as
well as global pressures.
</P>
<P>
   The drop in interest rates follows a meeting Friday in San
Francisco between Japan's minister of finance, Kiichi Miyazawa and
US Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Federal Reserve Bank
chairman Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting raised speculation the officials might discuss a
coordinated reduction in global interest rates. Miyazawa said
Greenspan didn't seek a reduction.
</P>
<P>
   But Fed watcher Robert Brusca, chief economist for Nikko
Securities Inc. in New York called Japan's rate reduction a
``Japanese ploy to try to make it seem there's a coordinated G-7
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a financial markets Trojan horse only this is a Trojan
horse made out of glass,'' Brusca said.
</P>
<P>
   Following Monday's rally, the Nikkei fell 157.95 points, or 1.06
percent, closing at 14,755.54. The central bank announced the rate
cut after the market's close.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign exchange experts said that the yen was well positioned
for the central bank's move. (A reduction in interest rates tends
to weaken a country's currency by making it less attractive to
foreign investors.) The yen had rallied Monday at one point to
130.40 per US dollar _ far below the 147 yen peak reached in
mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strengthening between early August and Wednesday gave them
room to move rates,'' said David Durrant, global strategist for
IDEA, an economics firm in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar surged almost 5 yen Wednesday to its biggest one-day
gain in three years after the Bank of Japan unexpectedly cut a key
interest rate to try to end the country's worst recession since
World War II. The dollar hit 137.04 yen in late New York trading
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate move by a banking-industry organization, the
Deposit Insurance Corp. agreed to spend funds to purchase troubled
assets of the collapsed Yutaka Credit Cooperative and to help a
merger between The Fukutoku Bank Ltd. and Bank of Naniwa.
</P>
<P>
   There is doubt that a half-point move downward in interest rates
would do much to stimulate the economy, because the banking
industry is in such poor financial condition that it is incapable
of lending to business _ at any rate _ said Marcus Noland, a senior
fellow and Japan expert at the Institute for International
Economics in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A ``crippled banking system (is) impeding the functioning of
monetary policy,'' Noland said. ``These are not dramatic gestures
but they've got to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Alexander president of the Japan Economic Institute in
Washington, a think tank funded by Japan's Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, said that although interest rates are already low, the
central bank was responding in part to pressure by US officials to
``start flooding the country with money and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, a rate cut would boost bank profits and, by spurring a
rally in the Nikkei, increase the value of stock portfolios held by
Japanese banks, Alexander said. ``It's only one crutch but they
need three. They need all the help they can get.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Diet, a plan for aiding the banking system, which
proposes to set up a government agency for handling the bailouts of
a growing number of sick banks, has been stalled since last summer
when it was introduced. The ruling and opposition parties have
failed to agree on tax cuts.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Twenty-four years ago, Watergate special prosecutor
Leon Jaworski gave Congress only raw evidence, not the kind of
analysis that lawmakers expect from the report that Whitewater
independent counsel Kenneth Starr delivered Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The material Jaworski supplied about President Richard M. Nixon
_ the only other time this century that Congress has seriously
considered impeaching a president _ is still under seal at the
National Archives, although much of it has been published in other
forms.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Wednesday that
most of the Starr's evidence about President Clinton would be made
public quickly.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt said at his joint news
conference with Gingrich on Wednesday that it was important for the
Watergate process to be followed.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt did not mention specific procedures. But times have
changed, circumstances are different and lawmakers may decide that
many of the Watergate precedents should not apply to the Clinton
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the nature and handling of the prosecutor's
report, these are some of the precedents to consider:
</P>
<P>
   _ In the 1974 impeachment proceedings, the House Judiciary
Committee heard all testimony in private sessions. Nixon's lawyer,
James St. Clair, was permitted to cross-examine the witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   _ St. Clair was on the government payroll as a White House
employee. Nixon did not have a private lawyer or need a legal
defense fund.
</P>
<P>
   _ Only a few senior members of the Judiciary Committee and the
committee's top lawyers were allowed to see Jaworski's documentary
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee's inquiry took seven months. Finally, on
July 27, 29 and 30, 1974, the committee approved three articles of
impeachment. On the crucial first article, charging Nixon with
obstruction of justice, the vote was 27-11. All 21 Democrats on the
panel and 6 of the 17 Republicans voted for impeachment. Nixon
resigned Aug. 9.
</P>
<P>
   A big difference between 1974 and 1998 is that Congress now has
a much sharper partisan edge. During the Nixon inquiry, about 10
conservative Southern Democrats and moderate Republicans _
including William Cohen, then a freshman Republican congressman
from Maine and now the secretary of defense _ held the balance of
power on the Judiciary Committee. All eventually voted for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Francis O'Brien, who was a top adviser to Rep. Peter Rodino,
D-N.J., the chairman of the committee in 1974, said Wednesday that
``Rodino felt from Day One that this middle group was central, that
only this group could convince the people of the committee's
fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   There are fewer such independent voices in Congress now. And an
analysis this week by Congressional Quarterly, a nonpartisan
magazine about Congress, concluded that the Judiciary Committee was
``one of the most politically polarized panels in Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   What Jaworski gave the Judiciary Committee in 1974 was a
briefcase stuffed with 800 pages of documents and 13 tape
recordings of Nixon's conversations in the Oval Office. An envelope
accompanying the briefcase contained a 60-page report that the
prosecutor called a ``road map.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``road map'' was essentially an index, according to those
who have read it, telling the committee what evidence appeared in
which documents. It had no analysis whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   The documents and the ``road map'' are now in a file at the
National Archives and cannot be made public because they contain
grand jury material that must remain secret unless released in a
court order, said David Paynter, the archivist in charge of the
records.
</P>
<P>
   The Nixon White House challenged Jaworski's authority to give
evidence to Congress, but the authority was upheld by the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Starr was appointed under the independent counsel law, first
enacted in 1978 and renewed in 1994. It specifically instructs the
prosecutor to ``advise the House of Representatives of any
substantial and credible information'' the prosecutor has ``that
may constitute grounds for an impeachment.''

PIONEER GROUP TO RESTRUCTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Jolted by troubles in the world's emerging markets, the
Pioneer Group Inc. said Wednesday that it would restructure itself
and take a tougher, bottom-line approach to its global collection
of eclectic businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The major reorganization signals that one of the most diverse
and adventuresome companies in the mutual fund and venture capital
businesses is rethinking its international leanings. Pioneer says
it will now cast a more critical eye on far-flung projects that
prove unprofitable, with a view to scrapping underperforming
assets.
</P>
<P>
   Under the change, Pioneer will consolidate operations as
disparate as an African gold mine and Russian brokerage to Polish
mutual funds and a Siberian timber farm along broad industry,
rather than geographic, lines.
</P>
<P>
   The change is more than a shift on paper.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Pioneer has given wide autonomy _ and big financial
support _ to each of its operations, garnering criticism from
shareholders upset about loss-making ventures that suck up profits
from Pioneer's core US mutual fund business. By allocating cash and
gauging performance along group lines, Pioneer will now be more
selective about what it invests in.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a greater degree of rigor in analyzing the
business opportunities and allocation of resources,'' said Timothy
T. Frost, Pioneer's new vice president for corporate affairs. ``If
we know a business does not fit the longer-term strategic profile
and provide benefit to shareholders, Pioneer will make the decision
to remove itself from that business.''
</P>
<P>
   The move, aimed at boosting profits and a lagging share price,
is likely to cheer investors. Shares in Pioneer, which announced
its restructuring after Wall Street closed, slipped 7/16
Wednesdayto end at 17 1/2, a new low, on the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   A consolidated Pioneer now has three core groups. Investment
management comprises the company's mainstay domestic fund business.
An international financial services group lumps together Poland,
the Czech Republic, Russia, and India, where Pioneer sells mutual
funds and other services to locals. Global investments groups the
Russian and African gold mines, Siberian timber, and other venture
capital operations.
</P>
<P>
   Under the change, Pioneer president John F. Cogan Jr., 71, will
play a narrower role at the company he has run for 35 years,
focusing more on strategy and less on day-to-day operations. The
restructuring also elevates Alan Strassman, a partner and board
chairman at Boston-based Martingale Asset Management, to vice
chairman of Pioneer's board. Strassman, 59, will work with Cogan on
strategic issues, Frost said.  &UR;  &LR; The changes come as wobbling
emerging, commodities, and stock markets test Pioneer's mettle.
Russia's economic meltdown has hit markets everywhere. Gold prices
remain low. While timber prices have risen recently from 30-year
lows, production problems have dogged Pioneer's Siberian
operations.
</P>
<P>
   On the home front, the US stock market's volatility has kept
mutual fund sales from growing faster. Midsized Pioneer's total
assets under management have slipped to $20.4 billion from $23
billion three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam, Lovell, de Guardiola &AMP; Thornton analyst Neal M. Epstein
recently downgraded Pioneer to ``hold'' from ``buy''. Frost
declined to forecast third-quarter earnings, saying only that they
would improve on the last quarter, when Pioneer reported a $12.1
million loss on its Russian and African projects. But he said
restructuring was not a warm-up to spinning off individual units,
market rumors notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer's struggles include efforts to sell part of its Forest
Starma Siberian timber project, where fires recently halted
logging. Pioneer has written off its $5.9 million investment in
Pioneer Bank in Moscow, which collapsed in August under sketchy
lending practices. And it has drastically scaled back operations at
Moscow-based Pioneer Securities, which made $10 million last year
before Asia's financial storm rolled into Moscow in October.
Overall, staffers at the company's Russian financial services
operations now number 150, compared to a January peak of 400.
Russia now has virtually no stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer had no exposure to the bad Russian debt that has handed
many US banks big trading losses. And one hopeful spot is its $500
million Pioneer-Banc One Real Estate fund, which will invest in
Russian buildings occupied by Western tenants.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Frost, who used to head Pioneer's Moscow operations, said
the company was reviewing its commitment to Russia quarterly. ``We
haven't written off Russia,'' Cogan said. ``But you have to proceed
with caution.''
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer has not seen net redemptions at its domestic mutual
funds this year, despite Wall Street's volatility, spokeswoman Anne
W. Patenaude said. August net fund sales had risen 126 percent on
year-ago levels. Domestic funds provide around half of Pioneer's
revenues and profit.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer's chief financial officer, William H. Keogh, sold 60,000
Pioneer shares this month for around $1.4 million and has filed to
sell another 30,000, Securities and Exchange Commission filings
show.

DEL RIO FLOODING CAUSES $34.5 MILLION IN DAMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   DEL RIO, Texas _ Flooding caused by Tropical Storm Charley
caused at least $34.5 million in damage to this South Texas border
city, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Aug. 23 deluge killed nine people and devastated San Felipe,
a poor section of the city. Six people remain missing and hundreds
of people are in temporary shelters.
</P>
<P>
   And after more than two weeks of frantic relief effort, local,
state and federal agencies aiding the flood victims are now moving
to the next step: housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first big hurdle is over now. We've gotten all the people
out of the shelters,'' said Ben Patterson, a spokesman for the
Texas Division of Emergency Management.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next step is to get these people into some type of
temporary housing. Right now some are still staying in motels or
travel trailers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to city building officials, the flooding destroyed 581
home. An additional 175 houses suffered major damage, and 3,000
were affected to a lesser extent, leaving a total estimated repair
bill of $34.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say they have no count of how many of the displaced
need temporary housing, although more than 800 people have already
received federal disaster-assistance checks.
</P>
<P>
   The money is for temporary housing, rental or for minor repairs
on flood-damaged homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We estimate that probably 700 families are not able to live in
their homes,'' said Beth Eby, city manager in the town of 31,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to say how many will need housing. We're targeting
300 now, but there are more, we'll put up more housing,'' Eby said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the temporary federal program, families receive 18 months
of free housing or rental assistance but must pay their utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Some flood victims are already being kept in short-term housing
in 15 travel trailers at a campground 10 miles west of town.
</P>
<P>
   But they and others will soon begin moving into larger
manufactured homes being installed in a recently cleared lot east
of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got 62 (manufactured homes) coming in, and our initial
authorization is for 500, although we may need less or we may need
more,'' said Pam Johnson, a spokeswoman for the Federal Emergency
Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, workmen were busy installing electric and water
meters on the 17 homes in place. The first families could move in
by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Among those taking shelter in the travel trailers were Virginia
Blanco.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got here three days ago, and we have no idea of how long
we'll be here,'' said Blanco, 50.
</P>
<P>
   She was still shaken by the flood, which claimed the lives of
several neighbors and nearly took her family as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``In five minutes more, I would have lost all of them. I just
got them in, and a lady came by crying for help and the cars were
all swirling by,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At least 100 homes in the flood plain will not be rebuilt, city
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Eby said the relief effort is now shifting to its final and most
difficult stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Number one was saving lives, and that took a few hours. Number
two was getting people into shelters, and that took a few days. And
number three was getting them into housing, and that will take
several weeks,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth phase, getting life back to normal, could take
several years, and even then might be unattainable, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people in San Felipe lived below the poverty line,
but the things that made life there comfortable and interesting
like their neighbors, the plaza, are all gone,'' Eby said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if we rebuild the neighborhood again, will it be what
they like? What they envision?'' she said.

COMMISSION DISBANDS AFTER HALF-CENTURY OF RETURNING NAZI-SEIZED
GOLD
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ An international commission set up 52 years ago to
return gold that Nazi Germany seized from central banks of
countries it occupied closed its books and disbanded Wednesday
after returning most of the last six tons to the original
claimants.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1997 the Tripartite Gold Commission delayed
distribution of the gold, then valued at $68 million, amid
disagreements over whether money, jewelry and tooth fillings of
Holocaust victims had become mixed up with the gold.
</P>
<P>
   After some hesitation, France joined the United States and
Britain, the other members of the commission, in pledging money to
a relief fund for individual victims who might have claims on the
monetary gold.
</P>
<P>
   About $60 million has so far been promised to the fund by 14
countries, including the three members of the tripartite commission
and most of the countries that recently received the last of the
gold. The total will probably rise to about $70 million, U.S.
Undersecretary of State for Economic, Business and Agricultural
Affairs Stuart Eizenstat said Wednesday after a ceremony at the
French Foreign Ministry to mark the milestone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mystery of how much victim gold was in this may never be
known,'' Eizenstat said later. ``We came up with an estimate of $4
million, but it could be much higher.''
</P>
<P>
   The French Foreign Ministry, which has opened the Trilateral
Gold Commission archives to the public, said France would
contribute $3.45 million to the relief fund. The United States has
pledged $25 million, and Britain $1.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Of the original 370 tons of foreign monetary gold reserves that
the World War II allies recovered from Germany in 1945, only
$300,000 worth belonging to Yugoslavia has not been returned. That
gold will remain on deposit in the Bank of England, officials said,
until Yugoslavia's successor states can agree on which should get
it.
</P>
<P>
   The actual amount of gold the Nazis seized from occupied
countries' banks and from victims of the Holocaust was much higher
than the amount the Trilateral Gold Commission recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Some is thought to have gone to Switzerland, which has been in
an uproar for most of the last two years over charges by Jewish
groups that Swiss authorities knowingly fenced gold belonging to
Holocaust victims for the Germans, and that Swiss banks held onto
assets of the Nazis' victims instead of trying to restore them to
their heirs.
</P>
<P>
   Stung by the charges, two Swiss banks, Union Bank of Switzerland
and Credit Suisse, agreed last month to settle claims against them
for $1.2 billion. Switzerland will also hold a referendum next year
on setting up a $4.7 billion fund for humanitarian purposes in
expiation for other charges, but approval is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that public opinion in Switzerland is very raw at this
point,'' Eizenstat said Wednesday. ``We hope that by the time of
the referendum next year, with the leadership of the Swiss
government, that public opinion will approve.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   France decided only last year to renew efforts to find the
owners of hundreds of artworks seized by German occupation
authorities or their French collaborators during the war, and is
trying to produce a complete inventory from files that had lain
untouched for most of the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies that failed to pay claims to survivors of
Holocaust victims and German companies that employed slave laborers
during the war are the latest to face class-action lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has organized a conference in Washington in
late November to discuss guidelines for museums, art dealers and
galleries on dealing with problems of disputed ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Austria said Wednesday that after years of refusing to allow
artworks to be shipped out of the country to claimants living
abroad, it would now agree to restore to their rightful owners
hundreds of art objects confiscated by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to document that at the end of the historically
burdened 20th century we want to clear things up once and for
all,'' Elisabeth Gehrer, the Minister for Education and Cultural
Affairs, said in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   Two paintings by the Expressionist Egon Schiele lent by the
Leopold Foundation in Austria to the Museum of Modern Art in New
York City have been held there since last January because of a
pending ownership claim by surviving members of a Jewish family
that lived in Austria when the Nazis took over.

IBM, XEROX TO ANNOUNCE DOCUMENT AGREEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ IBM and Xerox, archcompetitors in the printer
business, will jointly market an officewide document management
system, comprising Xerox's Document Centre line of digital products
that do triple duty as printers, copiers and scanners, and IBM's
Lotus suite of document management software.
</P>
<P>
   The companies are scheduled to announce the agreement Thursday,
when Xerox plans to introduce its latest copiers, printers and
software.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're offering a green-button-simple, end-to-end solution for
managing documents and messages,'' said Mark Hill, general manager
of Xerox's Office Business Unit.
</P>
<P>
   IBM is similarly effusive. ``Customers can now enhance their
investment in Lotus, and participate in the convergence of the data
and document worlds,'' said Mark Bregman, general manager for IBM's
pervasive computing group.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is not a classic partnership. IBM and Xerox
salespeople will visit large accounts together, but customers must
pay separately for the copiers and the software. There is no
discount for buying the products together, nor are IBM and Xerox
pooling any portion of the revenues for package sales. In fact,
both companies remain free to recommend other copiers or software.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is, they are trying to get a few extra sales by
leveraging each other's relationships,'' said Jonathan Rosenzweig,
an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, IBM Japan and Fuji Xerox have a similar arrangement
that does include one-stop shopping and revenue-sharing features,
and Xerox and IBM are trying to work out similar details in the
United States. ``We put this deal together in just a few months, so
we didn't have time to lock up the terms and conditions,'' Bregman
said.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the companies' main selling point is the
compatibility of their products, and thus the ease with which they
handle e-mail, companywide memos and other methods of creating and
disseminating words and images. Advertising claims to the contrary,
that is not yet a no-brainer in the digital world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Information systems managers spend a lot of time making things
work together that were supposed to be compatible,'' said Barry
Tepper, a senior consultant at Cap Ventures Inc., a market research
firm.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox particularly has had a hard time persuading companies that
it understands such nuances of the digital world. It has solid
relationships with the purchasing agents who buy stand-alone
copiers, but is not entrenched among the information technology
managers who run computer networks. Hewlett-Packard, Canon and
other printer and copier companies continue to nip at Xerox's heels
in the digital market.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year Xerox spent $415 million to buy XlConnect
Solutions Inc., a computer services company that has helped shore
up its image as digitally savvy. But it still needs the access to
IBM's vast customer list, including the 24 million current users of
Lotus Notes that this marketing agreement provides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Xerox can benefit from IBM's credibility with information
executives,'' said Jack Kelly, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   IBM is also vulnerable right now. Microsoft Exchange is taking
big bites out of Lotus' market for so-called collaborative software
that lets users share information. ``No one sits on laurels with
Microsoft breathing down their neck,'' Tepper said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, although the two-year-old Exchange does not have Lotus'
track record, it may have something more important. ``Microsoft has
the magic dust that IBM once had,'' said Chris Le Tocq, a software
analyst with Dataquest, a research firm. ``There's an attitude that
you can't go wrong with a Microsoft product.''

DOLLAR RISES 4 PERCENT AGAINST YEN AFTER JAPAN CUTS INTEREST RATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also JAPAN-RATES) 
(JT) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The dollar rose almost 4 percent against the Japanese yen on
Wednesday after Japan's central bank announced a surprise cut in an
important interest rate.
</P>
<P>
   But the sudden surge, which pushed the dollar up to 137 yen,
hides the real surprise about the dollar's recent performance
against both the yen and the German mark: The American currency has
weakened against these two leading currencies despite the economic
turmoil and political uncertainty that has roiled world financial
markets the last two months.
</P>
<P>
   The decline, some analysts argue, is disturbing because it is
another indication of how the global economic crisis is having an
intensifying effect on the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The drop in the dollar's value, especially against the mark,
these analysts say, reflects a belief that the global crisis will
spread to Latin America, weakening those economies. In turn, that
weakness will restrain large markets for American exports, helping
to slow growth in this country and further undercut corporate
earnings and the stock market. In the end, the economic slowdown
and stock market declines would force the Federal Reserve to cut
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion last Friday by Alan Greenspan, the Fed's
chairman, that it would consider a rate cut if the foreign drag on
the U.S. economy worsened has only bolstered this view.
</P>
<P>
   As a general matter, when the world shudders, the dollar
rallies. On Aug. 19, 1991, for example, when the Soviet leader,
Mikhail Gorbachev, was briefly ousted from power by hard-liners,
the dollar surged more than 3 percent against the mark that day.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, with President Boris Yeltsin barely holding on in
Russia and the refashioned Communists in a degree of ascendancy,
the dollar has not rallied; it is falling. Since Aug. 26, it has
dropped 4.7 percent against the mark, slipping Wednesday to a 1998
low of 1.7215 marks from 1.7285 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar-yen rate has been a barometer of global investors'
lack of confidence in Japan to turn its economy around and lead
Asia out of economic crisis. Just weeks ago, analysts were worried
that the yen would fall to a rate of 150 to the dollar, possibly
touching off a devaluation of the Chinese currency, the yuan.
</P>
<P>
   But even with Wednesday's dollar rally, the American currency is
still 7 percent below its eight-year high on Aug. 11, although
Japan, despite Wednesday's rate cut, has still not put many
significant policy changes into effect.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some analysts said that the Japanese rate cut had been
prompted in part by the yen's surprising rebound against the
dollar. Before Wednesday, the dollar was off roughly 10 percent,
settling in New York on Tuesday at 132.10 yen. This gave the
Japanese central bank the opportunity to cut rates without worrying
that the yen would plummet near the dangerous 150 level.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar's drop, especially against the yen, stems in part
from the unwinding of profitable trades as global investors,
including hedge funds, seek to cover their losses from Russia and
other emerging markets. This means that they have been selling
dollars and buying back yen after making big profits on the decline
of the yen all year.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, the current weakness of the dollar against the yen
could be reversed once this type of selling is finished. The surge
in the dollar Wednesday may already reflect this.
</P>
<P>
   That reversal will be even more likely, analysts said, if the
Japanese government fails to overhaul its banking system and to cut
taxes _ measures American officials and others argue are needed to
get Japan's economy out of recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the dust settles on this, the underlying fundamentals
will reassert themselves, especially on the yen,'' said Jonathan
Francis, global strategist at Putnam Investments in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But according to Avinash Persaud, global head of currency
research at J.P. Morgan Securities in London, there are two more
important factors at play.
</P>
<P>
   One is a new aversion among investors to taking risk. With
Russia's decision to devalue the ruble and the absence of new
international help for the economy there, ``the appetite for any
risk has collapsed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One barometer of this risk aversion is the spread, or
difference, between the yields on U.S. Treasury notes and bonds and
those on the debt of foreign governments. That spread has jumped
from about 6 percentage points to more than 14 percentage points in
a little more than two months.
</P>
<P>
   In this atmosphere, he said, investors are getting out of trades
or bets abroad and fleeing to the safe harbor of their local bond
markets. This means Japanese are buying back yen and Germans are
purchasing marks. ``I just want to have less of any exposure _ that
is what we are hearing on the dealing floors,'' Persaud said.
</P>
<P>
   The second factor is the fear that the economic crisis that
began in Asia in July 1997 will strike Latin America in force,
harming the economies in a region crucial for American exports and
economic strength.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of appetite for risk intensifies this kind of feared
contagion. With more investors preferring to stay home, countries
like Brazil will have to offer higher interest rates to attract the
dollars they need to cover their growing current account deficits,
the total of trading deficits in goods and services. This puts even
more pressure on these nations to devalue their currencies and
makes more speculators bet that this will happen.
</P>
<P>
   And if Latin America is harmed, the drag on the U.S. economy,
which sends about 15 percent of its exports south, could be enough
to prompt a cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Persaud has looked at the times when the Dow Jones industrial
average has fallen 5 percent or more in two weeks and the Fed has
moved from a policy of stable or rising interest rates to lower
rates. In six of those occasions since 1982, he said, the value of
the dollar has fallen.
</P>
<P>
   So for the American investor, more than the outlook for the
stock market now seems to hinge on the Federal Reserve. Greenspan
and his colleagues, who meet again at the end of the month, may
also influence the near-term outlook for the dollar.

HOUSE REPUBLICANS TO SEEK BIG TAX CUT FROM BUDGET SURPLUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republican leaders challenged the heart of
President Clinton's domestic policy strategy Wednesday, saying they
would press for a tax cut worth up to $80 billion over five years
and pay for it by dipping into projected federal budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   Their decision puts House Republicans _ already considering
impeachment proceedings against the president _ on another
collision course with the White House. Clinton has insisted that
the surplus be set aside until Congress and the administration have
agreed on a plan to shore up the ailing Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   For most of this year Clinton's ``save Social Security first''
strategy had kept Republicans from pursuing a big tax cut paid for
by the budget surpluses, which are projected to reach more than
$1.5 trillion over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans, especially in the House, have grown
increasingly willing to push for a tax cut, in part because of
their perception that Clinton is politically weakened and
distracted and in part because of polling suggesting that voters
think Congress can cut taxes and still have plenty of money left to
save Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton again warned Republicans on Wednesday that tapping the
surpluses before they actually materialize was fiscally
irresponsible. Eager to change the subject from Monica Lewinsky,
White House officials clearly were happy at the prospect of a
policy fight that would play to the historical Democratic strength
as defender of the Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a mistake for us to go out and have an election-year
gimmick to please people,'' Clinton said in an address to Democrats
in Florida, ``no matter how pleasing it would be, with a tax cut
until we have saved Social Security for the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Senate Republicans remain wary of challenging Clinton on
the issue, and it is unclear whether the Senate will even take up a
tax cut of any size in the few weeks remaining before Congress
adjourns early next month.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Newt Gingrich and other Republican leaders in the House,
however, believe that it will be hard for the Senate not to act if
the House passes a tax-cut bill in the next several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this summer, Gingrich had been pushing for a much bigger
tax cut, but Wednesday he said he would settle on a smaller package
this year in the hopes of pushing through a more ambitious
reduction next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think somewhere in the $70 to $80 billion range would be the
most likely tax cut this fall,'' Gingrich told a news conference
Wednesday afternoon after meeting with his leadership team,
referring to the value of the tax cut over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the tax cut would be completely financed by using
the surplus, Gingrich replied, ``Virtually all of it, yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means
Committee, is drafting a tax bill for the Republicans, and could
have it ready for consideration by the committee at the end of next
week, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill will probably include a tax cut for some two-income
couples, tax breaks for farmers and ranchers who have been hit hard
by an economic downturn in agriculture, and an increase in the
income that retirees can earn without losing some of their Social
Security benefits.

REPUBLICAN EFFORT TO OVERHAUL BANKRUPTCY LAWS APPEARS DOOMED 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: ADDS quote from kennedy, minor edits; filed in ``w'' and
``f'' categories.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An effort to overhaul bankruptcy laws appears
doomed as Republicans and Democrats remained sharply divided
Wednesday over how to deal with the soaring number of consumers who
get protection from creditors.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, sponsor of legislation that
would require judges to consider a person's ability to repay at
least some debts before excusing liabilities, said his bill would
``screen out those who want to avoid debts they can afford to
pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Grassley told the Senate that businesses lost about $40 billion
last year as a result of bankruptcy, amounting to ``a hidden tax of
$400 per family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something must be done to curb a skyrocketing rate of
bankruptcies that reached an all time high last year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A record 1.35 million consumer bankruptcies were filed in 1997,
and 361,908 were filed in the second quarter of 1998, the most ever
reported in a three-month period, according to the Administrative
Office of the U.S. Courts.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans are expected to fall short of the 60 votes
needed to overcome Democratic opposition to the bill. A vote could
come as early as Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., has said that if the
vote failed, ``that will be it for the year.''
</P>
<P>
   .MDNM/Sen. Richard Durbin, a co-sponsor of the legislation, said
``it is in its heart a good bill'' but that it still needs changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should call on the credit card companies to accept more
responsibility,'' said Durbin, D-Ill. He added that many credit
companies solicit people who are ``too young or mentally
incompetent'' receive cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time and time again a lot of people take these credit cards
and then get more deeply in debt,'' Durbin said. ``You almost have
to shove (credit card companies) away from the mailbox.''
</P>
<P>
   Durbin said credit card companies should be required to say on
the monthly statement how long it will take to pay off the balance
if you make the minimum payment. ``It will give a person a sobering
message,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As households get deeper into credit card and other unsecured
consumer debt, Durbin said, ``they become more vulnerable'' to
personal bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   He said the average person filing for bankruptcy has an annual
income of $17,652, and that the average debt is about $28,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people making less than $10 an hour,'' Durbin said.
``They are not the fat cats, the ones who go to canny attorneys.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats are even more critical of the overhaul plan and
vow to pull out all stops to kill it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The GOP believes that the bankruptcy system should be a
collection system for the credit card industry, funded by the
taxpayers,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said recently.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 306-188 in June to approve an overhaul of the
bankruptcy laws.
</P>
<P>
   Both the House and Senate bills seek to shift some debtors from
Chapter 7 bankruptcies into Chapter 13.
</P>
<P>
   Under Chapter 7, a consumer is able to discharge much unsecured
debt, such as credit card or medical bills, within a few months. To
do so, a debtor must liquidate assets and pay what he or she can to
creditors. Under Chapter 13, a debtor commits to repay at least a
portion of the debt with future earnings over three to five years.
</P>
<P>
   Arrangements for repaying secured debt, such as loans for a car
or a house, are typically made separately.
</P>
<P>
   On the Senate floor Tuesday, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman
Orrin G. Hatch, who favors the bankruptcy bill, said unnecessary
consumer bankruptcies harm small business owners, senior citizens
who rely on rental income, and members of credit unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some people who can pay all of what they owe but opt
out through the bankruptcy system because of current loopholes in
the law itself,'' said Hatch, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee approved Grassley's bill 16-2 in June.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An effort to overhaul bankruptcy laws appears
doomed as Republicans and Democrats remained sharply divided
Wednesday over how to deal with the soaring number of consumers who
get protection from creditors.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, sponsor of legislation that
would require judges to consider a person's ability to repay at
least some debts before excusing liabilities, said his bill would
``screen out those who want to avoid debts they can afford to
pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Grassley told the Senate that businesses lost about $40 billion
last year as a result of bankruptcy, amounting to ``a hidden tax of
$400 per family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something must be done to curb a skyrocketing rate of
bankruptcies that reached an all time high last year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A record 1.35 million consumer bankruptcies were filed in 1997,
and 361,908 were filed in the second quarter of 1998, the most ever
reported in a three-month period, according to the Administrative
Office of the U.S. Courts.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans are expected to fall short of the 60 votes
needed to overcome Democratic opposition to the bill. A vote could
come as early as Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., has said that if the
vote failed, ``that will be it for the year.''
</P>
<P>
   .MDNM/Sen. Richard Durbin, a co-sponsor of the legislation, said
``it is in its heart a good bill'' but that it still needs changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should call on the credit card companies to accept more
responsibility,'' said Durbin, D-Ill. He added that many credit
companies solicit people who are ``too young or mentally
incompetent'' receive cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time and time again a lot of people take these credit cards
and then get more deeply in debt,'' Durbin said. ``You almost have
to shove (credit card companies) away from the mailbox.''
</P>
<P>
   Durbin said credit card companies should be required to say on
the monthly statement how long it will take to pay off the balance
if you make the minimum payment. ``It will give a person a sobering
message,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As households get deeper into credit card and other unsecured
consumer debt, Durbin said, ``they become more vulnerable'' to
personal bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   He said the average person filing for bankruptcy has an annual
income of $17,652, and that the average debt is about $28,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people making less than $10 an hour,'' Durbin said.
``They are not the fat cats, the ones who go to canny attorneys.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats are even more critical of the overhaul plan and
vow to pull out all stops to kill it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The GOP believes that the bankruptcy system should be a
collection system for the credit card industry, funded by the
taxpayers,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said recently.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 306-188 in June to approve an overhaul of the
bankruptcy laws.
</P>
<P>
   Both the House and Senate bills seek to shift some debtors from
Chapter 7 bankruptcies into Chapter 13.
</P>
<P>
   Under Chapter 7, a consumer is able to discharge much unsecured
debt, such as credit card or medical bills, within a few months. To
do so, a debtor must liquidate assets and pay what he or she can to
creditors. Under Chapter 13, a debtor commits to repay at least a
portion of the debt with future earnings over three to five years.
</P>
<P>
   Arrangements for repaying secured debt, such as loans for a car
or a house, are typically made separately.
</P>
<P>
   On the Senate floor Tuesday, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman
Orrin G. Hatch, who favors the bankruptcy bill, said unnecessary
consumer bankruptcies harm small business owners, senior citizens
who rely on rental income, and members of credit unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some people who can pay all of what they owe but opt
out through the bankruptcy system because of current loopholes in
the law itself,'' said Hatch, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee approved Grassley's bill 16-2 in June.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: WHAT PASSES FOR NEWS AT 11 P.M. 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An acquaintance given to ending his day with the 11
o'clock news on Channel 2 called recently to draw my attention to
some oddities he has encountered in the evening's chronicle of dire
dispatches. My own subsequent week of viewing confirms his
impression that what used to be a relatively sane assemblage of
headlines shows signs of infection by experts.
</P>
<P>
   Whether other local-news purveyors are going in a similar
direction requires separate investigation, but, for now, join me in
a few highlights from CBS' Channel 2.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday evening, up popped one Marilyn vos Savant, identified
as ``one of America's smartest women,'' a possessor of ``one of the
world's highest IQs.'' What is such a smart woman doing on the 11
o'clock news instead of, say, in the State Department or at
Sloan-Kettering? Well, a job's a job. One of the anchors promised
viewers, ``If you have a question, she has the answer.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, I had no questions that night, but others did.
Somebody needed to know why a package of frozen strawberries thaws
faster in water than in the air. Somebody else has been losing
sleep over why some people claim to dream in color. And yet a third
seeker, obviously up to no good, inquired into how many heads and
tails would turn up on a random bout of coin-flipping.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. vos Savant (can that really be her name?) applied her
formidable IQ and came up with answers that I could have lived
without. She ended her two minutes with a response to a viewer who
demanded to know the ``ultimate compliment for anyone.'' Ms. vos
Savant revealed that it consists of ``only three words.'' Yes, they
are ``I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   What was I watching? Was this news of some sort? Of what sort?
Was it a vaudeville act? Was it a sly send up of the high-IQ
crowd's affectations? Was Ms. vos Savant, who may owe her
brilliance to an inexpensive encyclopedia, kidding or being kidded?
Or was she just a desperate invention of Channel 2, in its
perpetual ratings chase, to attract a credential-crazed element?
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine many people being stimulated just before
bedtime by the best way to defrost strawberries, but for pillow
talk you can't go wrong with ``I love you.'' If Ms. Savant seems
too highbrow, you may want to settle for a feature called ``The
Lowdown'' from Tad Low. One day last week the ``Lowdown'' consisted
of ``surprising secrets about your trash.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday I ran into something labeled ``a medical news
update'' sponsored by the Mount Sinai Medical Center. Packaged
under the title ``To Your Health,'' this little item may have
seemed to the unwary to be a real news story, since it was
introduced by Ira Nash, M.D., who passed us along to two
specialists in white coats who read from a prompter about the
wonders of the latest in laparoscopic surgery. (The white coat is
television's version of an elevated IQ.)
</P>
<P>
   It was a confusing concoction, owing mainly to the intrusion of
that Nash in this plug for Mount Sinai. What function did he serve?
What was his specialty? Was he on the payroll of the hospital or
the television station? (Where is Ms. vos Savant when you do have
questions?) Since he was dressed in mufti and had nothing of
substance to say, viewers were left to deduce that he found he had
a telegenic gift and could make out better by devoting his title
and talents to the service of the Channel 2 advertising department
than to flesh and blood.
</P>
<P>
   As for those gents in the white coats, they were identified as
real doctors and had evidently been told to do their bit for Mount
Sinai. To their credit, they looked uncomfortable enough.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday yet another sort of expert appeared. An enthusiastic
performer named Brian Finnerty, Channel 2's ``financial guru,''
asked himself the question, ``Where are the markets heading?'' and
after dropping some knowing phrases about volatility and so forth,
answered with a reassuring assessment of life after the fall of the
Dow.
</P>
<P>
   Finnerty, who was not wearing a white coat, predicted that in
six months or a year ``this correction will be seen as a tick in
the chart that continues to trend higher for the long run.'' The
question for the audience is how high Finnerty's IQ trends.
</P>
<P>
   One understands that no news producer who wants to send his
viewers to bed with colorful dreams is likely to end their day with
a bear. But personally, I won't do a thing until I hear from
Marilyn vos Savant on how much the market loves me.

EXERCISE, DIET EVEN MORE IMPORTANT AS BODY AGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Earl Shaffer, a spry 79-year-old, is hiking the
2,000-mile Appalachian Trail this summer _ for the second time in
50 years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, Shaffer was the first person to hike the entire
Appalachian, which was made into contiguous pathway from a series
of recreational trails in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Shaffer is a happy wanderer, but he's being a little more
cautious on this trip than when he was 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must rest every so often,'' he told a reporter for NBC's
``Weekend Today'' show. ``When I was younger, I could go up a slope
pretty easily. Now, I must stop every now and then.''
</P>
<P>
   Age. It slows footsteps, wrecks knees and makes bones creak.
It's the enemy of joints, tendons and ligaments.
</P>
<P>
   The older we get, the longer we take to recover from injuries.
Our immune system begins to break down. Wounds don't heal as
quickly. Illnesses persist. When we undergo surgery, we take longer
to shake off the effects of anesthesia.
</P>
<P>
   But before you Gen-Xers get too smug, be aware that the body
actually begins to deteriorate as early as the late 20s and early
30s. The teen years are prime-time live for the human body. From
there, it's all downhill.
</P>
<P>
   The realization sometimes comes as a shock to the 40-something
who decides to get back in shape after snubbing the gym for a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) ``What's happening?'' (end ital) the perplexed baby
boomer asks. (begin ital) ``I used to party till midnight and hit
the workout room at 6 the next morning. Now, my knees ache for days
after one session on the Stairmaster.'' (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   Brad Myers, a personal trainer with Bally Total Fitness in Mesa,
Ariz., explains: ``Men's minds are still writing checks from the
memory of what their bank account was. But their bodies can't cash
those checks.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell Chick, team orthopedic surgeon for the Arizona
Cardinals, sees firsthand the waning of youth. By the mid-30s, a
man's soft tissues begin to lose their elasticity. Muscle pulls,
hamstring injuries and back strains take longer to heal.
</P>
<P>
   And these are athletes in top physical condition.
</P>
<P>
   Although most players in the National Football League are in
their early 20s, their life span in the body-battering sport
averages only a little more than 3{ years, Chick says.
</P>
<P>
   Metabolism also begins to slow in the 30s. Bodies carry a higher
percentage of fat and less lean-muscle mass. Weight gain is a more
difficult battle.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't happen overnight, says Chick, 50, who has seen the
effects of age on his own workout capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's sneaky. It's gradual,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Rose, a Mesa man who reinstituted a workout routine a year
ago with Myers as his personal trainer, says he can tell he's not
20 anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your shoulders, your wrists, if you do something, it seems to
take forever to recover. It lingers,'' says Rose, 50. Minor
injuries ``just don't go away.''
</P>
<P>
   He remembers muscle strains that once took a couple days to
heal. Now, they languish for a week.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the deterioration of muscle strength and tone,
heart and lung capacity is reduced with age, says Dr. William
Martz, family practice physician and assistant director of the
Family Medicine Residency Program at St. Joseph's Hospital and
Medical Center in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   By the 20s, the body _ instead of growing _ is declining. Bones,
muscles and cartilage begin to erode. Only elite runners seem to
stave off the aging process for a few more years, Martz says,
peaking in their late 20s and early 30s with maximum
oxygen-carrying abilities.
</P>
<P>
   For women, childbirth may be one of the most rigorous workout
they will experience. Here, too, optimum age for pushing out babies
is the 20s, Martz says. Teens are physically hardier but lack the
emotional strength and maturity to handle the ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   After the 20s, women may experience weight gain and loss of
abdominal muscle tone, making it more difficult to push during
labor. They may need more medication to assist in delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Any kind of surgery is more challenging with advancing age.
</P>
<P>
   Incisions don't heal as quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Blood clots are more likely to develop.
</P>
<P>
   A 20-year-old might get out of bed after several hours
post-operation, fully recovered from anesthesia, while a
60-year-old might take a day or two to shake off the effects.
</P>
<P>
   Post-op pneumonia and other infections are more likely in the
older patient as the immune system falters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your immune cells, like other cells, are starting to
decline,'' says Martz, the family practice physician.
</P>
<P>
   These are the grim facts of life.
</P>
<P>
   But hang onto your Nikes and your six-pack of Ensure. There is
good news.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what your age, your physical condition can improve.
And improved health, nutrition and body tone will help you feel
better, fight illness better, recover from surgery more quickly,
run faster, leap higher.
</P>
<P>
   Myers, the Bally personal trainer, vows he can help ``anybody,
anytime'' shape up.
</P>
<P>
   You might not head for the Appalachian Trail, but your joints
will creak a little less.
</P>
<P>
   Though Mesa's Rose remembers the days when he easily bounced
back from injuries, he says he feels better at 50 than he did at
20.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good,'' says Rose, who is a healthy 5 feet 11 inches
tall and 175 pounds. He walks a treadmill, rides a stationary bike
and lifts weights. He plans to drop another 10 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Arnold, a 41-year-old Tempe, Ariz., woman, recently began
a workout program. After just six weeks, she went from leg pressing
70 pounds to 160 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold skipped workouts when she was in her 20s and 30s, though
she tried aerobics at 31. For a time, she also walked a treadmill,
but found it a yawner.
</P>
<P>
   ``God, it was boring,'' she says. ``Even if you were watching
TV, it was boring.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnold finds weight training more to her liking. It seems to
burn more calories, and ``there's a sense of accomplishment you
don't get on the treadmill.''
</P>
<P>
   Her goals are weight loss and feeling fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still see myself as physically and mentally around 32,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Chick, the Cardinals' orthopedic surgeon, warns that jumping
into a midlife workout routine carries a risk. Personal trainers
who are former bodybuilders sometimes attempt to train their
clients the way they trained _ sometimes too vigorously.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't do that with a 45-year-old lady or a 45-year-old
man,'' Chick says.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of a workout program should be to improve flexibility,
maintain weight control and achieve cardiovascular benefits, he
says, not qualify for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Warm-up periods with adequate stretching are crucial. Without a
proper warm-up, muscles can stiffen, and you'll find yourself
groaning over your computer keyboard the next day. Overeager
trainers do more harm than good, Chick says.
</P>
<P>
   Myers, the Bally personal trainer, agrees with Chick ``100
percent.'' He designs different routines for his older clients than
he does for his young Turks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I direct my training a little bit slower, but not easier,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he was scolded by one feisty 76-year-old client when
she suspected he was coddling her.
</P>
<P>
   The average adult's sedentary lifestyle speeds the body's
deterioration, says Paul Kennedy, area director for Bally. Most
people stop exercising at 35 to 40.
</P>
<P>
   But within two to three months after beginning a workout
program, anyone can make ``remarkable inroads,'' increasing
flexibility of joints, strengthening muscles and increasing lean
body mass, Kennedy says.
</P>
<P>
   A change in diet to more fruits and vegetables and less fat
completes the transformation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aging is something you can't fight,'' says Martz, the family
practice physician. ``But being in the best shape, following a
sound diet _ fruits and vegetables, fiber _ and getting regular
exercise has been shown to boost the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the best ways to stay young and recover faster.'' &QL;

MARK MCGWIRE: FRIENDSHIP, FAMILY AND FANS KEPT HIM ON ROAD TO
HISTORY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ It was late in the afternoon of Aug. 18, and Mark
McGwire had not, in two or three weeks, had much to laugh about.
His chase of Roger Maris' &QL; 
home run record had slowed considerably, with only two home runs
hit since July 28. The first baseman for the Cardinals, in Chicago
to face the Cubs, was tired and increasingly bothered by the
attention he was receiving and the attempts some reporters were
making to pry into his personal life.
</P>
<P>
   He had 47 home runs and still had 39 games in which to hit the
additional 15 he needed to break Roger Maris' record, but if his
drought continued much longer his chances could be in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People wanted to get more, they wanted to keep finding out
stuff,'' Tony LaRussa, McGwire's manager, recalled of the scene in
Chicago. ``They started to ask questions about his personal life.
He got calls from home saying that people were trying to talk to
people. He felt that was out of bounds. What does that have to do
with anything? He got teed off. That's when he was a little edgy.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a moment the edge vanished. With the Cardinals in various
stages of stretching outside their dugout at Wrigley Field, Sammy
Sosa, who himself had 47 homers, decided to approach McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The swarm of photographers when Sammy came over was amazing,''
McGwire recalled. ``I've never seen anything like it. We just
hugged each other. We had to laugh. How can you not laugh about
that?''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange, a hug and a laugh, had an unburdening effect on
McGwire. More at ease, McGwire, starting the day after his
impromptu embrace with Sosa, unleashed a torrent of 15 home runs in
22 games that catapulted him into history. He arrived there Tuesday
night when he swatted his 62d home run against Steve Trachsel of
the Chicago Cubs at Busch Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The race between McGwire and Sosa is not over. Although McGwire
broke the record Maris established in 1961 by hitting one more home
run than Babe Ruth slugged in 1927, the man who will replace Maris
in the record book will not be determined until McGwire and Sosa
have batted for the last time this season.
</P>
<P>
   The cathartic and propulsive moment in Chicago in August, then,
was pivotal for McGwire. But it was only one vignette in a summer
tale of a man who held up, and performed, under unceasing pressure
and scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, punctuating the story's unfolding chapters with bursts
of home runs, found a way to excel even on a team whose overall
performance was disturbingly disappointing, and he prevailed
despite becoming, for several weeks, a kind of oversized poster boy
in the heated debate over the use of potentially
performance-enhancing substances.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, McGwire helped elevate interest in, and passion
for, a tarnished sport; he provided financial windfalls for
opposing teams who sold out their stadiums when he came through; he
turned the routine of batting practice into a quirky carnival,
drawing those who wanted to be awed. But he also traveled a very
personal journey, taking strength from visits with mentors and old
friends, his child and parents, and forging new, deeply felt
relationships with Sosa and the Maris family.
</P>
<P>
   But the story's final, conclusive plot line appears to have been
cemented in Chicago in August. Sosa, who unlike McGwire was new to
the rarefied air of the 50-homer plateau, had handled the attention
with remarkable ease, humor and grace, and his attitude might have
rubbed off on McGwire in their meeting.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire and Sosa were tied at the time with 47 home runs, and in
the game in Chicago on Aug. 19, Sosa snatched the lead by hitting
his 48th home run in the fifth inning. But it would be the only
time Sosa led McGwire, and he would hold that lead for less than
three innings.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth inning, McGwire hit his 48th, then connected again
in the 10th for No. 49 and a lead he would not relinquish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The season is a grind, with all the travel, and your body goes
through a tired period,'' McGwire said of his August slump. ``This
happens every season, but when it happened this year _ I hadn't hit
a homer in 30 at-bats _ reporters were wondering, `What's wrong
with Mark McGwire?' But nobody asked me. And that's when I got
peeved at some of the reporters. I know I came off testy, but the
whole thing got blown out of proportion.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire sensed even before he hit 48 and 49 that they were
coming. He got a clue, he said, from his first two times at bat in
that game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me I was getting really close,'' he related. ``I
just missed one my first at-bat and the second one I just missed it
and popped it straight up in the infield. I've played this game
long enough to know it's just a matter of time, a matter of
millimeters.'
</P>
<P>
   He swatted No. 50 at Shea Stadium in New York the next day in
the first game of the first of two consecutive doubleheaders
against the Mets. With his swing against Willie Blair, McGwire
became the first player in history to hit 50 home runs in three
successive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my first at-bat, it was tough to see,'' McGwire said.
``Everybody was having trouble seeing because of the shadows. ``But
I felt good my second at-bat. He threw me a slider down and I went
down and got it. It was almost like a golf shot. I didn't think it
had enough to go out. I thought that the wind would knock it
down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty was a very important number for him,'' LaRussa, the
manager, said. ``Getting to 50 relaxed him more than anything.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire long had said no one should talk about the home run
record until a player had 50 home runs at the start of September.
He was 11 days early. ``I'd have to say I do have a shot,'' he
concluded then.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire had in the previous two seasons served notice that he
could be a threat to the record. He hit 52 home runs in 1996 and 58
last season, joining Babe Ruth as the only players who reached 50
in two successive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Topping 61, then, was the talk of spring training, and McGwire
instantly justified the questions he had quickly tired of. He hit
one home run in each of the team's first four games.
</P>
<P>
   But the early weeks of the season did not provide hints of the
race to come between McGwire and Sosa, a race that came to both
push McGwire and more broadly define the assault on Maris' record.
On May 24 McGwire had 24 home runs, Sosa only nine. Ken Griffey Jr.
and Alex Rodriguez of Seattle were closer to McGwire with 18 each.
</P>
<P>
   But beginning May 25, Sosa smacked 21 home runs in his next 22
games, a tear that took him to June 21 and slashed McGwire's lead
to only 33-30. The streak established Sosa as a legitimate
challenger to the record and filled him with confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, though, McGwire downplayed any sense of a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no competition,'' McGwire said late in the season. ``I
don't know where this competition got started. It is so good, what
is going on right now, for the game of baseball. It just happens to
be the home runs and what he and I are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Competition or not, McGwire and Sosa frequently homered on the
same day, with McGwire more often than not responding to a Sosa
initiative. From June 24 through last Saturday, they hit home runs
on the same day 13 times _ a total of 16 for McGwire and 13 for
Sosa.

</P>
<P>
   A reporter interviewing McGwire after a game noticed a bottle in
his locker. It contained testosterone-producing pills called
androstenedione, a substance banned by other sports organizations
but not baseball. The ensuing article triggered a debate over
McGwire's use of the pills and threatened to tarnish the record he
would set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel it might help make me stronger,'' said McGwire, who had
been angered by the disclosure, ``and I want to do whatever I can
to strengthen my back, which I've had problems with through the
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The most important element in McGwire's march toward the record
was his ability to stay healthy. Robbed of numerous games in
several earlier seasons because of injuries, he has been virtually
free of them this season. He suffered an episode with his back and
missed three games in Los Angeles the first week of June, but that
was the extent of his health-related time off.
</P>
<P>
   However the pills aid in his workouts, McGwire still has had to
make contact with the baseball, and the ``andro'' furor did not
undermine his ability to do that. Nor did it affect the way fans
viewed him. In fact, McGwire prompted a new phenomenon in baseball
_ the curtain call on the road.
</P>
<P>
   After expressing his appreciation for the reception Shea fans
accorded him _ ''They were rooting me on; it was tremendous'' _ he
went to Pittsburgh, where his presence created two successive
sellouts in a stadium that usually is filled with empty seats. The
successive sellouts were the first during the regular season since
the Pirates began playing in Three Rivers Stadium in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting a home run in each game (Nos. 52 and 53), McGwire was
saluted by standing ovations and demands for a curtain call. Each
time he was summoned from the dugout to acknowledge the fans and
their prolonged ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept clapping for about a minute so I ducked my head out
and gave them a wave,'' he said after the first curtain call. ``I
hope the Pirates didn't mind.'' Later he said, ``I wish every
ballplayer could have the feeling I had in Pittsburgh. It's
absolutely incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later Sosa experienced the feeling, slugging a home
run in each of two consecutive games in Pittsburgh and being called
out of the visitors' dugout.
</P>
<P>
   For McGwire, the home runs and the curtain calls continued in
Florida the first two days of this month. In Florida McGwire also
had a visit from an old friend, Doug Rader, who had been the
hitting coach in Oakland for part of the time that McGwire played
with the Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1991,'' said LaRussa, under whom Rader worked, ``Mark hit
.201 and in 1992 Doug came to Oakland and Mark gives him credit for
helping him get his career turned around. He laid a lot of stuff
out for Mark and got him back on target.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first game against the Marlins McGwire struck out twice
and didn't get a hit in three at-bats. Rader, who is retired from
baseball and lives in Stuart, north of Miami, visited McGwire
before the second game. McGwire, delighted to see Rader, eagerly
embraced him and chatted with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's brutal what he's going through,'' Rader said. ``But he's
a fine, fine man and he has his mental house in order.''
</P>
<P>
   LaRussa thought the visit gave McGwire a spark, inspired him.
``Mark said he definitely was excited to see Doug,'' the manager
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh inning of the game, McGwire clouted his 56th home
run against Livan Hernandez, last year's World Series hero, tying
Hack Wilson's 68-year-old National League record.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in the dugout, Dave Parker, the Cardinals' hitting coach,
walked over to McGwire. ``Now that you've tied Hack,'' Parker told
him, ``you might as well break it your next at-bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitting against Don Pall, a journeyman relief pitcher, in the
ninth inning, McGwire did precisely that.
</P>
<P>
   The next night McGwire hit No. 58 against Brian Edmondson in the
seventh inning. The pitch, McGwire said later, was about three
inches off the ground. ``I think I amazed myself that I golfed it
off the ground,'' he remarked.
</P>
<P>
   ``How'd you hit that pitch?'' Randy Knorr, the Marlins' catcher,
asked McGwire when he stepped into the batter's box to face Rob
Stanifer in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' the remarkable McGwire said and then hit No.
59.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier that day, Sosa had hit his 56th home run at Wrigley
Field against Jason Bere of Cincinnati, moving him only one from
McGwire. But as he had done for weeks, McGwire responded to the
challenge and created an an even larger lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark's the man,'' Sosa said, sounding the mantra. But Sosa was
not so awed by ``the man'' that he withered away in the record
chase. The home runs in Pittsburgh against Jason Schmidt and Sean
Lawrence gave him 58.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's having a magical year,'' McGwire said of his friendly
rival. ``I root him on like everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   But before Sosa connected for No. 58 last Saturday night,
McGwire lofted one of his typical fly balls into the left field
stands at Busch Stadium that afternoon, a first-inning shot on a
2-0 fastball from Dennis Reyes. When the ball descended into the
stands, McGwire matched Babe Ruth's legendary 60 and became only
the third player to hit 60 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Geez,'' the redheaded McGwire stammered, ``I mean, geez, Babe
Ruth. What can you say? Geez. You're almost speechless when people
put your name alongside his name.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire didn't remain alongside Ruth for long. Two days later,
with the Cubs in town and Sosa in right field, McGwire drove
another baseball beyond the left field fence, this time on a 1-1
fastball from Mike Morgan in the first inning. This time when the
ball cleared the fence, McGwire was even with Roger Maris and only
one swing away from eclipsing him, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just happens today is my father's 61st birthday,'' McGwire
said, ``I hit my 61st home run, my son arrives. I mean you can't
ask for anything better than that.''

JAPAN'S CENTRAL BANK REDUCES RATES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Japan's central bank, apparently seeking to appease an
international community urging action on the country's deepening
banking crisis, reduced interest rates for the first time in three
years.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected move Wednesday by Bank of Japan trimmed the
target interest rate for overnight loans between banks to 0.25
percent from an already low 0.5 percent to inject liquidity into a
system of crippled banks, many of them near collapse. The rate is
the equivalent to the US federal funds rate.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of Japan acted ``to maintain the stability of the
financial markets,'' said the central bank's governor, Masaru
Hayami. ``The restoration of the financial system, along with
economic recovery, are priorities that can't be delayed any
longer.''
</P>
<P>
   That statement is precisely what western leaders want to hear
from policy makers in Tokyo. But some economists viewed the tiny
rate cut as a poor substitute for other, more effective measures
that have stalled in Parliament, including a stimulative program of
tax cuts to spur economic growth and a much-needed banking reform
plan to repair a troubled industry.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, the world's second-largest economy, has a total of $1
trillion in troubled loans in its banking system, according to one
estimate.
</P>
<P>
   The rate reduction ``is a sign of the lack of progress in fiscal
programs,'' said Richard Marston, professor of international
finance at the Wharton School of business at the University of
Pennsylvania. ``It looks like the Bank of Japan is just desperately
doing what it can do without parliamentary approval.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of Japan, like this country's Federal Reserve Board, is
a relatively independent organization unfettered by politics,
though it faces internal pressure from a troubled banking sector as
well as global pressures.
</P>
<P>
   The drop in interest rates follows a meeting Friday in San
Francisco between Japan's minister of finance, Kiichi Miyazawa and
US Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Federal Reserve Bank
chairman Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting raised speculation the officials might discuss a
coordinated reduction in global interest rates. Miyazawa said
Greenspan didn't seek a reduction.
</P>
<P>
   But Fed watcher Robert Brusca, chief economist for Nikko
Securities Inc. in New York called Japan's rate reduction a
``Japanese ploy to try to make it seem there's a coordinated G-7
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a financial markets Trojan horse only this is a Trojan
horse made out of glass,'' Brusca said.
</P>
<P>
   Following Monday's rally, the Nikkei fell 157.95 points, or 1.06
percent, closing at 14,755.54. The central bank announced the rate
cut after the market's close.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign exchange experts said that the yen was well positioned
for the central bank's move. (A reduction in interest rates tends
to weaken a country's currency by making it less attractive to
foreign investors.) The yen had rallied Monday at one point to
130.40 per US dollar _ far below the 147 yen peak reached in
mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strengthening between early August and Wednesday gave them
room to move rates,'' said David Durrant, global strategist for
IDEA, an economics firm in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar surged almost 5 yen Wednesday to its biggest one-day
gain in three years after the Bank of Japan unexpectedly cut a key
interest rate to try to end the country's worst recession since
World War II. The dollar hit 137.04 yen in late New York trading
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate move by a banking-industry organization, the
Deposit Insurance Corp. agreed to spend funds to purchase troubled
assets of the collapsed Yutaka Credit Cooperative and to help a
merger between The Fukutoku Bank Ltd. and Bank of Naniwa.
</P>
<P>
   There is doubt that a half-point move downward in interest rates
would do much to stimulate the economy, because the banking
industry is in such poor financial condition that it is incapable
of lending to business _ at any rate _ said Marcus Noland, a senior
fellow and Japan expert at the Institute for International
Economics in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A ``crippled banking system (is) impeding the functioning of
monetary policy,'' Noland said. ``These are not dramatic gestures
but they've got to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Alexander president of the Japan Economic Institute in
Washington, a think tank funded by Japan's Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, said that although interest rates are already low, the
central bank was responding in part to pressure by US officials to
``start flooding the country with money and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, a rate cut would boost bank profits and, by spurring a
rally in the Nikkei, increase the value of stock portfolios held by
Japanese banks, Alexander said. ``It's only one crutch but they
need three. They need all the help they can get.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Diet, a plan for aiding the banking system, which
proposes to set up a government agency for handling the bailouts of
a growing number of sick banks, has been stalled since last summer
when it was introduced. The ruling and opposition parties have
failed to agree on tax cuts.

   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ Beside the rough ocean that defines Nova
Scotia, near a kilted piper whose lament pierced the breeze, the
victims of Swissair 111 were remembered Wednesday by their families
and the people who adopted the loss as their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have made us feel so loved, so cared for,'' said Clare
Mortimer of California, whose father and stepmother perished in the
Sept. 2 crash.
</P>
<P>
   Mortimer and other relatives of the 229 people who died in the
crash were joined by hundreds of rescue workers and villagers for a
memorial service in the town of Indian Harbour.
</P>
<P>
   Children sang hymns, prayers were offered, and tears feel freely
among a community of mourners and supporters seeking closure to a
week of unbelieving pain and exhausting labor.
</P>
<P>
   The service was attended by Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien, Swiss President Flavio Cotti, US Transportation Secretary
Rodney Slater, Federal Aviation Administration chairman Jane
Garvey, and the chairmen of the Canadian and US transportation
safety boards.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial ended with the mournful sounds of ``Dark Island,''
a Scottish bagpiper's lament about one's yearning to return home.
And a wreath was dropped from a Canadian military helicopter on the
waters near the crash scene. There, helmet-wearing divers returned
to the debris field where the cockpit voice recorder is believed be
lying 190 feet below the surface. The tape is expected to provide
critical clues about the source of smoke in the cockpit, and how
the pilots responded to the escalating emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Concrete mooring platforms were placed on the ocean floor to
secure a Canadian vessel as a diving platform. In this way, a
continuous supply of surface air can be supplied to the divers, who
then will be able to work longer on the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Lieutenant Commander Louis Garneau of the Canadian navy said
that divers would not retrieve any human remains Wednesday,
although many bodies are believed to be pinned on the bottom by
large, nearby pieces of the aircraft's fuselage.
</P>
<P>
   Garneau said that salvage ships, with assistance from the USS
Grapple, probably will not attempt to lift fuselage wreckage for
two or three days.
</P>
<P>
   On the shore, Canadian army troops shifted the focus of their
shore patrols closer to Peggys Cove, about 5 miles from the crash
site. Captain Dan MacIsaac said that soldiers had filled two large
bags with plane wreckage and human remains Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, Swissair rebutted the theory that the wiring
insulation used on the MD-11 had put the aircraft at particular
risk. The aromatic polyimide tape insulation, known by the trade
name Kapton, has been banned by the US Defense Department on
fighter planes.
</P>
<P>
   However, Swissair spokesman Hans Klaus said from Zurich that the
tape is used to protect wiring ``in all commercial planes except
the Boeing 777 ... It is very common in the airline industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, which now owns the McDonnell-Douglas operation that
delivered the MD-11 to Swissair, confirmed this week that all
general-purpose wiring on the plane was insulated by Kapton.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Swissair crew reported smoke in the cockpit and
because an electrical malfunction cut off power to the flight-data
recorder for the last six minutes of the flight, the plane's wiring
is one area that investigators will scrutinize.
</P>
<P>
   The US Navy began tests of this type of insulation in 1978.
Since 1986, the Navy has prohibited its use in new aircraft
programs. The wiring is said by critics to be vulnerable to the
dramatic changes in temperature and humidity that aircraft
experience during flight. Critics say it deteriorates too quickly,
cracks easily and can be shown to explode under some conditions.
</P>
<P>
   With worn insulation, metal-to-metal contact can result and
electrical arcing is possible. Joachim Maitre, a Boston University
professor of journalism and international relations who has written
extensively on defense technology, said Kapton is so volatile it
explodes like magnesium.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram studied 265 field reports
of electrical problems on Air Force F-16s between 1978 and 1986. In
those reports, the newspaper found at least 45 wire firers or
severe arcing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, the Navy asked Congress for $354 million to rewire its
fighter jets. The request stated that ``numerous wiring harnesses
made of Poly-X wire'' _ a similar kind of aromatic polyimide tape _
``have had abnormal insulation aging, embrittlement and cracking
resulting in wire-to-wire sparks, particular during presence of
water.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress did not approve the request, and the Navy began
rewiring fighter jets with money from its own budget.
</P>
<P>
   Fighter planes, however, are subject to many more rigors than
commercial aircraft. One national aviation official, who asked not
to be identified, said Wednesday that comparing military and
passenger jets would be ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
   John Hansman, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor
of aeronautics who is director of the International Conference for
Air Transportation, stressed Wednesday that focusing on Kapton now
is premature.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know for sure it was an electrical fire,'' Hansman
said. ``We do know there was smoke and electrical interruption, but
there are other fire and smoke sources that are still being
investigated.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapton, he said, is a relatively common insulator. ``To my
knowledge, there's not a lot of people in the safety community
saying we need to get Kapton off airplanes,'' Hansman said.

BIOLOGIST GLUT MEANS JOBS IN SHORT SUPPLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Citing a glut of biology PhDs that has left thousands of young
scientists in a frustrating ``holding pattern'' seeking permanent
jobs that are in short supply, a federal report Thursday urges US
universities to halt further growth in graduate life-sciences
training programs or risk having bright young people shun the
field.
</P>
<P>
   More and more newly minted PhDs in biological and medical
sciences are languishing for years in poorly paid postdoctoral
training positions before getting their first permanent jobs _
often not until they are 35 or 40 years old, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   Others are giving up on getting one of the increasingly
competitive faculty positions at research universities that were
their first choice, and going into what many see as less desirable
fields like biotech, finance, law, or technology transfer. Even
these opportunities are not as easy to land as the students are led
to believe, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   As for the roughly 20,000 young scientists in postdoctoral or
``postdoc'' positions, many are ``very frustrated,'' said Shirley
Tilghman, a Princeton professor who chaired the committee of the
National Research Council, affiliated with the National Academy of
Sciences, that is issuing the report. ``It's as if they are
circling LaGuardia (Airport) using up valuable intellectual fuel
and waiting for their turn to land.'' These difficulties, in turn,
may be sending dispiriting signals to graduate students and young
people still in their undergraduate or high school years, perhaps
deterring them from pursuing life science careers, officials worry.
</P>
<P>
   Increased funding for biomedical research over the last 10 years
has caused graduate training programs to expand more rapidly than
have the desirable faculty research jobs.
</P>
<P>
   PhDs awarded by US universities jumped from about 5,000 in the
middle 1980s to 7,696 in 1996, the report says. Harvard Medical
School, for example, increased its doctoral slots by 50 percent in
the late 1980s, and now turns out 70 or 80 PhDs annually, making it
one of the nation's largest programs, said Thomas Fox, associate
dean for graduate education.
</P>
<P>
   Research and education officials in the Boston area, home to
some of the most prestigious biomedical training programs in the
country, agreed that conditions have changed but did not uniformly
concur with the dire tone of the report. In part, they agreed, it
is because PhDs from Boston institutions are highly regarded and
job hunting is more rewarding. Nevertheless, there was agreement
that the academic road is the hardest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority still are coming because they have a passion for
science and they want to discover, and they want to make a
contribution,'' said Fox at Harvard Medical School. ``But we are
working very hard to be upfront and tell them that academic
positions are not assured'' even with a Harvard PhD.
</P>
<P>
   Some students said they had reluctantly changed their goals,
while others said they were trying to be more flexible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've given up on traditional academic jobs,'' said a
Massachusetts Institute of Technology student who is finishing her
doctorate in biomedical engineering. Not only are those positions
tough to get, she said, but she now feels ``it doesn't seem like a
very attractive life choice for me _ the reward comes way too late
and I don't want to put my life on hold.''
</P>
<P>
   While many students do not rate biotech jobs as their first
career choice, that view is changing, said students and faculty
members, and Janice Bourque, executive director of the
Massachusetts Biotechnology Council, said companies have lots of
unfilled jobs for PhD-level scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they might want to take a look at some of the jobs
opening up in industry here and think creatively of how they could
use their backgrounds in some of these positions,'' she said,
adding that some companies are recruiting foreign life sciences
graduates to fill gaps in their ranks.
</P>
<P>
   While the report focused on the problems facing students set on
academic positions, research and educational officials in Boston
area institutions said the diversity of life sciences careers today
is a good thing, not a tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the solution is not to say we are training too many
people'' but to support those who go into nonacademic areas, said
Eve Marder, a Brandeis University neuroscientist who coordinates
Brandeis's five life-sciences graduate programs. ``I feel very
strongly that if a third of our PhDs were to leave the active
pursuit of science and go into another venue that would be a
tremendous asset, because it would mean we have well-educated
students at the interface'' of science and society.

   BEREA, Ky. _ Nobody calls Berea College a party school.
</P>
<P>
   It has no fraternities or sororities. The campus and most of the
county surrounding it are dry. There is no movie theater in town.
Only seniors can own cars. Smoking is severely restricted, even
though this is tobacco country. And there are no football weekends,
because there is no football team.
</P>
<P>
   Must be a religious school, you say. Well, yes and no. It was
founded in 1855 by the Rev. John Fee, a Presbyterian minister, in
what was then a wilderness, where the bluegrass meets Appalachia.
But it is affiliated with no denomination and lives by no dogma,
fundamentalist or otherwise. And it has Buddhists and Muslims as
well as Christians on its faculty and in its student body.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing drab or monastic about Berea. The campus is a
leafy, pretty, neo-Georgian place, the teachers are talented and
enthusiastic, a rich variety of extracurricular activities and
organizations are available, and there are intramural and
intercollegiate teams in a large number of sports.
</P>
<P>
   The entrance requirements are a little odd, especially the one
that says only students from families with incomes below $44,000 a
year will even be considered. About 80 percent of the student body
is drawn from the hard-luck hills and hollows, villages and cities
of southern Appalachia. Berea must be the only college in the
country that hangs out a sign: Rich kids need not apply.
</P>
<P>
   Berea charges no tuition. It requires each of its 1,500 students
to work at least 10 or 15 hours a week in a wide range of jobs.
Some make brooms or weave cloth in the craft shops, some operate
the college's computers, some work in the Berea Hospital, and some
wait on tables at the Boone Tavern Hotel near the campus.
</P>
<P>
   Which may explain why the students, most of them at least, voice
no complaints about the lack of social facilities taken for granted
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all in the same boat here,'' said Tyra Lainhart, 27, a
junior from Erlanger, who came to Berea, married, had a baby,
dropped out, divorced, worked as a prison guard and this summer
returned to college. ``We have a common bond in our economic
situation. Nobody has money for a lot of extra stuff. The money you
earn from your job goes to pay for books, room and board.''
</P>
<P>
   Angela Hale, a 22-year-old senior from Childersburg, Ala., said
that when she went home on vacation some of her friends, students
at Tuskegee University and elsewhere, talked ``mainly about parties
and fashion.'' Ms. Hale, who had never been out of her home state
before she came to Berea, said she was glad to be on a campus
``where it's never about what you wear and what you look like.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the students said that if they had not come to Berea,
they could not have gone to college anywhere, at least not to a
school that seeks to provide a high-quality four-year liberal arts
education. Fully 70 percent of them are the first in their families
to go to college. Some had never spent a night away from home
before coming here. Many take their first plane flight when they
make a college-sponsored or aided trip to Europe during their time
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a culture shock,'' said Larry Shinn, the college's
president. ``The leap from Paint Lick or Stone Gap or Stinking
Creek to a tough academic environment in the big city of Berea,
population 10,000, takes some doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Berea was the first college in the South to admit blacks and
women on an equal basis. An outgrowth of the struggle against
slavery, it was the creation of Fee and a fiery abolitionist named
Cassius Clay, who opened meetings by laying a Bible, a copy of the
Constitution and a bowie knife on the lectern _ the Bible, he
explained, for those who believed in God, the Constitution for
those who believed in man, and the knife for those who believed in
neither.
</P>
<P>
   Shinn, a former professor at Oberlin College and administrator
at Bucknell University, makes no sweeping claims for Berea's
academic standards, though more than 55 percent of its graduates
earn advanced degrees and the college regularly scores well in
annual ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have a realistic notion of what we are and what
we're not,'' he said. ``We're not in the top 10 among liberal arts
colleges, but we're in the top 50, and we provide an education of
real excellence. It's a question of money. Williams College spends
$51,000 per year per student, we spend $18,800.''
</P>
<P>
   The teacher-student ratio is as good as Harvard's, but teachers
carry heavier loads. Students help renovate dormitories and build
computers from components. Berea's endowment is $525 million, but
it has no tuition income, and it has fewer rich alumni than many
schools. What is more, it turns down the children of the rich
alumni it does have, because of the $44,000 income lid.
Nonetheless, it raised $17 million last year, more than 80 percent
from non-alumni.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle binds the place together and creates ``a strong
foundation,'' said one of the college's star students, Addie Sine,
20, from Knoxville, Tenn., the daughter of a single mother who
supports herself as a beautician.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like our own little culture,'' she said. ``It's a secure
place. You know that next year the trees will be in the same place
and the teachers will come back because they love teaching here.
Most of all, the students will be people who want to be here, who
need to be here because it's a chance to make something of
themselves, not because someone told them to go to college.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Stephens, 21, a psychology major from Whitley City,
agreed. The thing that worries here, she said, ``is this: When we
graduate, into a world where everyone is obsessed with money and
possessions, will we be able to deal with real life?''

BELL   ATLANTIC OFFERS FLAT-RATE MOBILE PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After losing some mobile telephone customers to AT&AMP;T
Corp. &UR;  &LR; recently, Bell Atlantic Corp. responded Wednesday by
offering its digital cellular customers several flat-rate pricing
plans that do not require long-distance or roaming charges. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The new programs, which cost $39.99 to $159.99 a month, could
spur other wireless providers to revise their prices and packages.
Competition is heating up with the introduction of flat-rate plans
that bundle large amounts of ``free'' minutes with long distance
and other features.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic's new rates, which require a digital cellular
phone, are primarily aimed at small business users, high- volume,
long-distance users and residential customers who talk &UR;  &LR; at least 90
minutes per month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customers won't pay for more than they need,'' said Dennis
Strigl , group president and chief executive of Bell Atlantic
Global Wireless. ``There's a plan for every user _ they talk a
little or talk a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Bell Atlantic's DigitalChoice SingleRate East plan,
customers can choose among &UR;  &LR; three options: $39.99 for 90 minutes a
month; $59.99 for 250 minutes; and $99.99 for 800 minutes. Each
rate includes all local calls as well &UR;  &LR; as &UR;  &LR; long-distance calls
between Maine and northern Georgia. Customers who exceed their rate
plan's ``free'' &UR;  &LR; minutes pay 20 cents to &UR;  &LR; 30 cents per additional
minute.
</P>
<P>
   A second plan, called SingleRate USA , enables Bell Atlantic
digital wireless customers to make calls anywhere in the country
for $159.99 per month and includes 1,600 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Bell Atlantic's new plans are a direct response to AT&AMP;T's
highly successful Digital One Rate program, which was the first
digital cellular plan in the nation to bundle long-distance with
high-volume minutes.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's Digital One Rate program costs $89.99 to $149.99 a month
for 600 to 1,400 minutes. Introduced in June, AT&AMP;T claims to have
more than 200,000 Digital One Rate customers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figured with a plan as popular as One Rate, that one of the
wireless carriers would come back with some kind of pricing action
and we're not surprised that it was Bell Atlantic,'' said Bruce
Jenkins, AT&AMP;T Wireless's vice president for New England.  &UR;  &LR; ``People
want a big bucket, one that includes lots of minutes, long
distance, roaming and other charges all bundled in a single bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins added that AT&AMP;T Wireless has found that its One Rate
plan has led some residential customers to make more of their
long-distance calls on their celluar phones rather than
conventional &UR;  &LR; phones _ because it costs less.
</P>
<P>
   Still other mobile phone companies said Bell Atlantic's pricing
action was a defensive move to keep customers from switching to
lower-cost providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing threatening in Bell Atlantic's new prices for
us,'' said Harris Jones III, New England general manager for
Omnipoint Corp. in Lowell, Mass.

LOTUS SEEKS TO NEUTRALIZE RIVAL'S 3-DAY CONFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANN MULLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For Lotus Development Corp., it's a slap in the face.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does the Cambridge-based software company have to worry
from afar about Microsoft Corp. encroaching on its territory. Now,
its archrival is flaunting competing software products in Lotus's
own backyard.
</P>
<P>
   As Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft Wednesday opened a three-day
conference in Boston to promote Exchange, its electronic mail and
messaging software, guerilla marketers from Lotus were out in
force, trying in not-so-subtle ways to deflect some of the
attention toward their own product, Lotus Notes.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttle buses wrapped in giant yellow Lotus ads met conference
attendees at Logan Airport, and offered them rides between their
hotels and conference events at the World Trade Center and the
Fleet Center.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, outside the main exhibit hall, ``intrepid Loti'' _ as
one Lotus executive called them _ handed out Lotus t-shirts and
buttons and invited attendees to a Boston ``E Party'' (instead of
Tea Party) sponsored by Lotus. Conference attendees who agreed to
wear the Lotus shirts on the exhibit floor qualified to win
freebies that included Red Sox tickets, Gypsy Kings concert
tickets, and, of course, test copies of the next version of Lotus
Notes, due out by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to be gracious hosts since Boston is the home of
Lotus Notes,'' said Lotus marketing executive Ken Bisconti, tongue
planted firmly in his cheek.
</P>
<P>
   As for last night's party, Bisconti said: ``Microsoft wasn't
throwing a good party, so we rented a place. We wouldn't be good
hosts if we didn't offer them some good entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft officials took the antics in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected they would do something to try to disrupt the
show. We're in their backyard. We expected no less,'' said Stan
Sorensen, lead product manager for Exchange. He said some of the
show's 4,600 attendees found Lotus's behavior to be rude, but said,
``we don't give it a second thought.''
</P>
<P>
   The two companies are locked in a fierce battle to dominate the
market for corporate electronic mail and ``groupware'' _ software
that allows distant employees to collaborate on a single document
or project.
</P>
<P>
   Lotus has about 25.1 million Notes users, compared to about 16.6
million for Microsoft Exchange, according to Electronic Mail &AMP;
Messaging Systems, an industry newsletter.

COMMUNISTS THREATEN YELTSIN WITH IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ As Russian President Boris Yeltsin pondered for a
second day over who would be his next prime minister, the
Communists threatened Wednesday to pursue impeachment proceedings
if he renominates Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   The warning was a pressure tactic to induce Yeltsin to abandon
Chernomyrdin. In the byzantine world of Russian politics, it was
also a defensive maneuver to block him from dissolving the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Yeltsin comes up with Chernomyrdin for the third time, the
Duma will raise the issue of impeachment,'' Communist Party leader
Gennady Zyuganov told reporters, referring to the lower house of
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin huddled with Chernomyrdin and Foreign Minister Yevgeni
Primakov, who has been touted for prime minister by the liberal and
Communist opposition, as speculation swirled that he might shuffle
the deck yet again and pick a new candidate.
</P>
<P>
   As the president remained closeted in his Gorky-9 residence
outside of Moscow, Russia's economy continued its downward spiral.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin on Wednesday lifted tariffs on medicines, a belated
effort to cope with shortages of drugs in pharmacies and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   But the scarcity of goods _ and old-fashioned profiteering _ has
continued to drive prices skyward. The State Statistics Committee
reported Wednesday night that prices rose by 36 percent during the
first week of September.
</P>
<P>
   The only apparent piece of good news was that the ruble rose
somewhat in value. Even that was deceptive. The change, economists
said, was largely the result of buying by banks and other customers
who need rubles to pay their debts. It was not a vote of confidence
in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The chaos in the marketplace was grist for the Communists, who
have cast themselves as the champion of Russia's downtrodden and
dispossessed.
</P>
<P>
   With Yeltsin at Gorky-9, the Communists took center stage
Wednesday. Declaring their willingness to form a government of
national unity, they issued a platform echoing Soviet themes.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists promised cheap credits to ailing factories and
tariffs to protect Russian enterprises from foreign competition.
Major industries would be renationalized. Salaries would be paid
and savings protected. There would be a crackdown on financial
speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Russia's most ardent market reformers conceded that the
left might succeed _ at least temporarily _ in securing a place for
themselves in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the present situation, of course, I cannot rule out the
coming to power of a government with the participation of
Communists or a government controlled by the Communists,'' said
Yegor Gaidar, the free market reformer and former prime minister.
``I do not have any faith in a lasting Communist comeback.''
</P>
<P>
   The escalating crisis has led to a bitter round of
finger-pointing. Anatoly Chubais, the former Kremlin aide who led
the negotiations with the International Monetary Fund, insisted
that the government had made every effort to stave off the
devaluation of the ruble and satisfy the West.
</P>
<P>
   But he told the newspaper Kommersant that Yeltsin had acted
correctly by denying to the very end that the devaluation of the
ruble was under consideration, saying that anything less would
heighten the panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``So now the international financial institutions understand,
despite the fact that we conned them for $20 billion, that we had
no other way,'' he said ruefully.
</P>
<P>
   The main focus, however, was on the wrangling over the prime
minister post. Yuri Luzhkov, Moscow's pugnacious mayor, who met
with Chernomyrdin on Wednesday, said he believed Yeltsin would
renominate Chernomyrdin for a third and decisive time.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody could be sure, however, just what Yeltsin would do.
Alexander Lebed, a Siberian governor and former general, predicted
that Yeltsin would yield to the demands of the Communist opposition
and nominate Primakov or Yuri Maslyukov, a Communist deputy and
former Soviet economic planner who served briefly in the Yeltsin
government before resigning.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist-led parliament has often engaged in loose talk
about impeachment. The impeachment procedures, however, have taken
on a new urgency.
</P>
<P>
   The parliament has twice rejected Chernomyrdin. Under Russia's
constitution, a third rejection would force the dissolution of the
body and new parliamentary elections _ unless the Communists come
up with their own legislative tactic to block it.
</P>
<P>
   That is why they are threatening to vote impeachment before
Chernomyrdin's nomination is taken up again. A vote to impeach
would preclude the president from dissolving the parliament for
several months, according to the constitution.
</P>
<P>
   To pursue impeachment, the Communists need the support of 300 of
the 450 votes in the lower-house of parliament, a margin that
Zyuganov insisted was attainable.
</P>
<P>
   It is much harder to actually remove the president. Any decision
to oust Yeltsin by the lower house of parliament would have to be
approved by a two-thirds vote of the upper house of parliament,
which has been more supportive of the Kremlin, and by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   The likely result would be a constitutional crisis. The
Communists would insist that the issue was impeachment. Yeltsin
could insist on his own reading of the constitution and press for
the disbanding of the parliament. He could even ask the
legislature's upper house to declare a state of emergency.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists are not the only ones working on impeachment. The
deputy chairman of the parliament's impeachment commission is
Yelena Mizulina, a member of the liberal Yabloko party, which is
headed by Grigory Yavlinsky, who is a fierce critic of Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   She said in an interview that the commission is planning to
complete the articles of impeachment this week so that that the
parliament can vote on them as early as Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The main charges will center on Yeltsin's role in the
dissolution of the Soviet Union, his decision to shell the
parliament building in October 1993 and the war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The talk of impeachment was not the only step the Parliament
took to protect itself _ and its perquisites _ Wednesday. Deputies
also voted to pay themselves wages through the end of the year even
if the parliament is disbanded.
</P>
<P>
   Some leading officials said none of the maneuvering would stop
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Asked who Yeltsin would nominate, Luzhkov said: ``You need to
know Boris Yeltsin. I think Chernomyrdin.''

TREASURY PRICES RISE SHARPLY AS JAPAN CUTS LENDING RATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Prices of Treasury securities rose sharply Wednesday,
as the dollar surged in currency trading following an interest rate
cut by the Bank of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year Treasury bond soared 1 13/32, to 103 20/32. Its
yield, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped to 5.26
percent, from 5.36 percent on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the 10-year Treasury note hit a 10-year low of 4.92
percent Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Chan, managing director and chief economist at Banc One
Investment Advisors Corp. in Columbus, Ohio, believes the reduction
by the Japanese central bank in the overnight rate for lending
between banks to 0.25 percent and calls by Japanese Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi for a coordinated global interest rate cut nearly two
weeks ago have clearly raised the level of speculation that the
Federal Reserve might soon lower U.S. interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   And although Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa indicated
that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan had not asked for any
rate cut from Japan, bond market investors quickly realized that
the original idea for a Group of Seven coordinated interest rate
reduction emanated from Japan and not from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result,'' Chan said, ``bond markets were buzzing all day
with rumors that the Fed would cut interest rates as early as
Wednesday or no later than the Federal Open Market Committee
meeting on Sept. 29.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My suspicion is that the U.S. central bank would prefer to
move in an orderly fashion and conduct any changes to its monetary
policy only at an FOMC meeting,'' he continued. ``Consequently, I
suspect that the next move will be decided at either the Sept. 29
or Nov. 17 meeting,'' depending on how global deterioration affects
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   If policy makers were looking for signs of further weakness
arising from the global crisis, they certainly failed to receive
that signal from Wednesday's wholesale inventories report for July.
The report showed a weaker-than-expected drop, down 0.2 percent, in
July wholesale inventories, suggesting the pace of import growth
will remain tepid in August and September.

CHICAGO POLICE REVIEW HOW TO TREAT JUVENILE OFFENDERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ After dropping murder charges against two boys, ages 7
and 8, in the brutal slaying of an 11-year-old girl, police
officials say they are taking a closer look at how they treat
juvenile offenders.
</P>
<P>
   The police charged the boys on Aug. 9 after saying they had
confessed to the murder of Ryan Harris. No lawyer or parent was
present during the questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Police spokesman Pat Camden said the department was talking with
the State's Attorney's office about requiring officers and
prosecutors to videotape interviews with suspects younger than 12
and having a parent or guardian present at such questioning.
</P>
<P>
   At a City Council meeting Wednesday, Alderman Robert Shaw
introduced legislation that would require a psychologist to be
present when any suspect under the age of 11 is questioned.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the proposed changes ``a step forward,'' Elizabeth
Tarzia, a public defender representing the younger boy, said this
case can help define how juveniles are treated in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Experts we've talked to say children under the age of 12
simply cannot understand their Miranda rights. They really ought to
have an attorney present,'' Ms. Tarzia said.
</P>
<P>
   Since restarting the investigation, police have questioned and
released a man known as ``the toy man,'' who the 7-year-old's
family had said gave numerous toys to the boy in the days preceding
the murder.
</P>
<P>
   However, after the man passed a polygraph test and endured
several hours of questioning, police said they were confident he
was not involved in the murder, and released him. They did send a
blood sample, which he gave voluntarily, to be tested for DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Police are still awaiting DNA test results from the 11-year-old
girl's underwear, where police found semen last week, prompting the
release of the two boys.
</P>
<P>
   Though charges have been dropped against the two boys, Police
Superintendent Terry Hillard has said the department is reserving
the right to reinstate those charges if the investigation warrants.
As a result, attorneys for the two boys have advised their clients
not to talk to police, effectively eliminating two possible eye
witnesses for the police to question further.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police have said that while the case is currently
dismissed, our client remains a suspect, and as long as that is the
case, we have told him not to talk to police,'' said Ms. Tarzia.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-year-old girl was spending the summer with a godmother in
the Englewood neighborhood of Chicago when she was killed on July
27. The police originally accused the boys of beating her with a
rock and suffocating her by shoving her underwear in her mouth and
leaves up her nose in an effort to steal her bicycle.

OPULENT JET GROUNDED IN FORT WORTH BY ROYAL DISAGREEMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LAURA VOZZELLA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Stuck off to the side of an airport runway,
a number of puny corporate jets nearby, sits a Boeing 727 fit for a
king.
</P>
<P>
   Owned by the Sultan of Brunei back when he was the richest man
in the world, the plane passed to Middle East businessmen and
royalty before winding up at Fort Worth Meacham Airport in December
1996.
</P>
<P>
   A company there was supposed to perform $12 million in repairs
and renovations to the $16 million craft, which had been set up to
carry no more than 30 people in opulent style. Outfitted with a
bedroom, whirlpool tub, kitchen and couches, the plane was going to
get a new entertainment system, satellite telephones and fresh
upholstery.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, its wings were clipped.
</P>
<P>
   The dark gray bird has been grounded for nearly 18 months
because of a legal dispute between two groups that ]claim to own
it. On one side is the nephew of Syria's president; on the other,
the prince and princess of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the high-powered Middle East connections and court
filings that list the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, the spectacle of
a luxury 727 languishing at Meacham is a curiosity in its own
right.
</P>
<P>
   ``This, in itself, is an odd situation,'' said Thomas Mathew,
president of Fort Worth Jet Center, where the 727 is being stored.
``People buy planes to use them.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed on behalf of Layale Enterprises, a
Panamanian company headed by Somar Assad. Assad's uncle is Syrian
president Hafez Assad. Somar Assad's father, Rifaat Assad, is the
president's brother and fierce political rival.
</P>
<P>
   Somar Assad is well known in his own right as an Arab Ted
Turner. He is the 20-something chairman of Arab News Network, a
24-hour channel based in London that went on the air a year ago
this month.
</P>
<P>
   Assad's company bought the plane from the Sultan of Brunei in
1987. In 1992, while it was parked at an airport in Jordan, the
plane ]disappeared, the lawsuit states.
</P>
<P>
   The suit accuses HMS Aviation, a company linked to the Kingdom
of Jordan, of making off with the 727.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanian officials, however, say that the kingdom received the
plane as a gift.
</P>
<P>
   Assad's company had left the craft at Queen Alia Airport in
Amman for nearly two years. During that time, the plane fell into
disrepair, the Jordanians said in court documents. Rather than pay
the estimated $2 million needed for repairs and accumulated storage
fees, Rifaat Assad gave the plane to Jordan in 1994, the kingdom's
lawyers ]said.
</P>
<P>
   The kingdom turned the plane over to Prince Talal Bin Mohammed
and his wife, Princess Ghida Talal. The nephew of King Hussein, the
prince was named head of Jordan's National Security Council in
1996. The prince and princess used the aircraft for official duties
and entered into a lease agreement with HMS Aviation, a company
owned by a Lebanese businessman named Hany M. Salaam.
</P>
<P>
   Salaam's company _ which bears his initials _ took the plane to
Meacham. His company is the original defendant named in the suit,
which has bounced between Tarrant County and federal court since it
was filed in April 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Salaam has had trouble with planes before. He runs another
Jordanian-registered Boeing 727, which he chartered to oil heir J.
Paul Getty Jr. in April for a flight from Barbados to Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadly, the ageing craft ... was refused permission to land
back in Britain because of new noise regulations which came into
effect at the end of March _ causing the flight to divert to
Paris,'' wrote Nigel Dempster, a columnist with London's ``Daily
Mail.''
</P>
<P>
   Dempster described Salaam as a ``Lebanese plutocrat'' involved
in a troubled Dubai aluminum plant. Questions were raised in a May
1997 ``Wall Street Journal'' article about high fees Occidental
Petroleum paid to Salaam for foreign drilling rights.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit is in U.S. District Court in Fort Worth, where
Jordan says the kingdom, as the purported owner of the plane, is
the real defendant. Lawyers for Jordan say the suit should be
dismissed because it is a sovereign nation.
</P>
<P>
   Assad's company says sovereign immunity does not apply in this
case.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers on both sides declined to comment on the case or say how
much the parties are paying to park the plane at the Jet Center.
Court documents list a figure of $2,600 a month, but it is unclear
if that includes maintenance as well as parking.
</P>
<P>
   While the legal battle rages on, the idled craft demands
attention. At least once a month, maintenance workers fire it up to
make sure all systems are in working order _ just in case it gets
to stretch its wings again.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got seals that will dry up and will start leaking
stuff. You've got oil in the engines that needs to be circulated,''
said Mathew, the Jet Center president. ``From a mechanical point of
view, it's just not good to let an airplane sit.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A renowned letter by Thomas Jefferson, which is the
highlight of a traveling Library of Congress exhibition intended as
a historical survey of religion and the founding of the nation, has
been seized upon by conservative Christian leaders as support for
their campaign for classroom prayer, taxpayer-financed vouchers for
religious schools and posting the Ten Commandments in courtrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Some conservative groups and scholars say the Library's analysis
of Jefferson's letter is authoritative evidence that could be used
in the courts to knock down the barrier between religion and
government.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the exhibition _ and of the controversy _ is a
famous letter written by Thomas Jefferson to the Danbury Baptist
Association in 1802. In it, the nation's third president coined the
phrase ``wall of separation between Church and State.'' Jefferson's
letter has been used in Supreme Court cases for more than a century
to describe the proper relationship between religion and
government.
</P>
<P>
   The Library of Congress' analysis of the Jefferson letter,
released at a news conference in May and written by James Hutson,
chief of the library's manuscript division, asserted that Jefferson
never meant his letter to be used as the foundation for law, but
instead was aimed at winning political favor with New England
constituents. Hutson's analysis said: ``The Danbury Baptist Letter
was never conceived by Jefferson to be a statement of fundamental
principles; it was meant to be a political manifesto, nothing
more.''
</P>
<P>
   The conservative leaders said this was proof that Jefferson's
``wall'' metaphor should never have been interpreted as an
overarching principle. The Christian Coalition immediately issued a
news release headlined ``Library of Congress Skewers `Wall of
Separation' Myth,'' and said the library's findings should bolster
the campaign for the ``religious freedom amendment.'' The magazine
of Focus on the Family, a multimedia ministry, called Jefferson's
wall ``flimsy.'' Gary Bauer of the Family Research Council wrote
that Jefferson's words had been ``twisted by liberals.''
</P>
<P>
   And last month the controversy ricocheted from Christian radio
to the ivory tower, when 24 legal scholars and historians sent a
letter to the library complaining that its interpretation of the
Jefferson letter was misleading and ``unbalanced.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned for really one fundamental reason,'' said
Robert Alley, professor emeritus of humanities at the University of
Richmond and one of two scholars who drafted the letter to the
library. ``If you're going to be the keeper of the precious
documents of the nation, you ought not to put them on display with
biased analysis, and certainly not with a paper that has not been
read by its peers and judged for its qualities, and with as many
egregious observations of opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview at the Library of Congress, Hutson, caretaker of
the library's manuscripts for 16 years, said he was amazed that a
brief paper he wrote as a ``press primer'' without footnotes had
been caught up in a tug of war with national policy implications.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing we want to do here is offer opinions on
constitutional law,'' Hutson said, his face flushing.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Hutson is 61, a Presbyterian churchgoer, a Yale graduate and an
expert on Benjamin Franklin. He said he was chagrined that the
uproar had overshadowed the 211 other documents and artifacts he
painstakingly collected for the exhibition. He said he would not
repudiate the thesis of his paper, but added, ``Maybe I should have
been more careful, but I really did try to guard against anything
like this happening.''
</P>
<P>
   The tempest began when Hutson set out to decipher the
blotted-out lines in the first draft of Jefferson's letter to the
Danbury Baptist Association. The final version says that ``religion
is a matter which lies solely between Man &AMP; his God, that he owes
account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the
legitimate powers of government reach actions only, &AMP; not
opinions.'' Jefferson restated the First Amendment's religion
clause, and followed with the words ``thus building a wall of
separation between Church and State.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutson asked the FBI to use its computer laboratory to uncover
the inked-out words in Jefferson's letter, just as the bureau had
done with a diary of Theodore Roosevelt's.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, Hutson was performing excavation on a document that
is a touchstone of American history. The ``wall of separation''
metaphor, though not found in the Constitution, is often invoked as
shorthand for the religion clause of the First Amendment to the
Constitution, which says that ``Congress shall make no law
respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free
exercise thereof.''
</P>
<P>
   The import of the ``separation'' language has been argued over
by scholars and cited in at least 50 Supreme Court cases dealing
with the relationship between government and religion. The Supreme
Court declared in Reynolds vs. United States in 1878 that the
``wall'' metaphor was ``almost an authoritative declaration of the
scope and effect'' of the First Amendment. Since then, justices
like Potter Stewart and William Rehnquist have argued that
Jefferson's words were misused.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI discovered that Jefferson had crossed out the word
``eternal'' preceding ``separation of Church and State'' _ as some
scholars had correctly guessed years before _ and inked over ``the
duties of my station, which are merely temporal.'' That last word
meant secular, as opposed to spiritual.
</P>
<P>
   In his essay, Hutson surmised that Jefferson removed these
phrases because they might sound ``too anti-religious to pious New
England ears.'' Jefferson's letter, dated Jan. 1, 1802, was meant
to reassure the Baptists of Connecticut, who were suffering
persecution from the Congregationalists in control of that state.
Jefferson also wrote that as president, he would not proclaim
national feast days and thanksgivings. But Hutson said that
Jefferson omitted that section because his advisers warned that it
might offend potential political allies.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after writing the Danbury Baptist letter, Jefferson
attended church services held in the House of Representatives,
Hutson wrote, which was ``his way of offering symbolic support for
religious faith and for its beneficent role in republican
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives like Randy Tate, executive director of the
Christian Coalition, embraced Hutson's findings, saying, ``Some in
the American elite would love to exclude all semblance of religious
expression in the public square, and I think that runs counter to
what Thomas Jefferson meant.''
</P>
<P>
   David Barton, president of WallBuilders, a group that says it
aims to restore biblical values in public policy, said, ``The
library has confirmed what a lot of us have already been saying,
that that letter was never meant to be a national policy paper.''
</P>
<P>
   The backlash followed. In June, Barry Lynn, executive director
of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, an advocacy
group in Washington, asked the library to declare Hutson's research
``merely one opinion,'' with which Lynn said most scholars
disagree.
</P>
<P>
   The letter from the 24 scholars, written by them but faxed to
the library by Americans United, lambasted Hutson's basic
contention that Jefferson's letter was a matter of politics and not
principle.
</P>
<P>
   Robert M. O'Neill, director of the Thomas Jefferson Center and a
professor of law at the University of Virginia, who helped draft
the scholars' letter, said, ``The fact that there may have been a
political context for Jefferson's letter hardly disqualifies it as
an assertion of principle, especially since it is so consistent
with everything else he did or said on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy may reverberate in the courts, said Daniel
Dreisbach, an associate professor of justice at American
University. ``I'll bet you my house,'' he said, that some judges,
faced with a case on school vouchers or creches on city hall steps,
will say, ``We shouldn't be basing constitutional law on the
Danbury letter.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition is now closed in Washington, and will soon travel
to Dallas, Philadelphia, Indianapolis and southern California.
</P>
<P>
   The library, whose staff members say they are not accustomed to
such controversy, is now trying to calm the furor. In a letter in
response to the 24 scholars, James Billington, the librarian of
Congress, said that ``the library has no control whatsoever over
the use that is made of, nor of the interpretation given to, the
many materials that it presents to the public.''

NEWFOUND PAGES FROM ANNE FRANK'S DIARY SET OFF FUROR 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RALPH BLUMENTHAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than 50 years after they were written in a secret refuge
from the Nazis, long-withheld pages from the diary of Anne Frank
have given her story a new twist and set off a furor over
exploitation of one of history's top best sellers, only recently
republished in a supposedly ``definitive'' edition.
</P>
<P>
   In the newfound entries _ actually five pages of diary revisions
censored by Anne's father, Otto Frank _ Anne picks apart her
parents' strained marriage, analyzes her own difficult relations
with her mother, Edith, and vows to keep the diary out of her
family's hands as ``none of their business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For a woman in love it cannot be easy to know that she will
never occupy the first place in her husband's heart, and mother
knew,'' Anne says. ``Father appreciates mother and loves her, but
not with the kind of love that I envisage for a marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   As for her diary, Anne says, ``I shall also take care that
nobody can lay hands on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The pages, augmenting one of the world's best-known books,
published in 56 languages, were given last year to an Austrian
writer, Melissa Muller, researching the first biography of the
Jewish girl in Amsterdam, Netherlands, who put an indelible human
face on the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   But in another peculiar twist, Ms. Muller, a 31-year-old
Austrian journalist, is now seeing her new book, ``Anne Frank: the
Biography'' (Metropolitan Books), come out with paraphrases and
selected quotes from the unpublished material while plans are being
advanced for updated editions of the diary to contain the new
material in full.
</P>
<P>
   A television biography, ``Anne Frank: The Missing Pages,'' based
on Ms. Muller's book, is scheduled for broadcast on Tuesday with
shots of the pages.
</P>
<P>
   In a measure of how intense the maneuvering has become, an
Amsterdam newspaper, Het Parool, published the disputed segments
last month and also posted them on its web page on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me this is terrible,'' Ms. Muller said in a series of
telephone interviews from Europe amid a crossfire of
recriminations.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are diary revisions written by Anne as she and her
family hid from the Germans in a secret annex over Otto Frank's
busy preserves warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   The missing entries, which were hinted at in a scholarly version
of Anne's diary published in 1986, were supplied to Ms. Muller by
Cornelis Suijk, international director of the Anne Frank Center USA
at 584 Broadway in Manhattan and an intimate of Otto Frank.
</P>
<P>
   Suijk (pronounced Sowk), a 74-year-old economist and Dutch
government auditor with 33 years of affiliations with Anne Frank
organizations in Amsterdam and the United States, said Frank had
given him the pages shortly before his death at 91 in 1980, during
a German police inquiry aimed at authenticating the diary in the
face of neo-Nazi claims it was a forgery.
</P>
<P>
   By Suijk's account, Frank wanted to be able to say honestly that
he no longer had any diary material in his possession, without
revealing anything potentially embarrassing to him or his second
wife, Fritzi, whom he had married in 1953. He also wanted to avoid
any debate over whether he had done the right thing in publishing
Anne's diary in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that something was missing but we had no idea who had
it,'' said Bernd Elias, Anne's cousin and last living relative and
chairman of the Anne Frank Fonds, or foundation, in Basel,
Switzerland, which holds the copyright on the diary and receives
the revenue from publication.
</P>
<P>
   The pages themselves are being claimed by the Netherlands State
Institute for War Documentation, to which Otto Frank bequeathed
custody of the diary. It has asked Suijk to turn them over but he
is claiming a onetime publication right of his own under Swiss law.
He has also sought a sponsor to buy the pages to raise money for
his Anne Frank Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Elias said it was ``absolutely illegal'' for
Suijk to have given the pages to Ms. Muller.
</P>
<P>
   Suijk, in turn, faulted the foundation for amassing what he said
was at least $20 million in royalties from the diary without
properly sharing them with Anne Frank causes around the world,
including his own center, which runs education programs on the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Muller said the Swiss foundation was initially enthusiastic
over her findings and only withdrew support after she declined to
submit her manuscript for review. The biography includes new
information that for the first time points a strong finger of
suspicion at a cleaning woman, Lena van Bladeren Hartog, now dead,
who may have tipped off the Germans to the Jewish family in hiding.
Ms. Muller said that by going over old police reports she found
that the woman had never been confronted with discrepancies in
accounts of her discovery of Jews hiding in the building. The woman
was angry too over her son's death in the German navy.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Muller, who divides her time between Vienna, Austria, and
Munich, Germany, came to her biography as a freelance journalist
who wrote extensively on childhood. As she recounted, she had no
hint of Suijk's secret when she sought him out, particularly for
information on Anne's mother, Edith Hollander, of whom little had
been written _ even by Anne.
</P>
<P>
   It was, she told Suijk, as if ``Anne Frank had no mother.''
</P>
<P>
   That insight and her other research into the family tree so
impressed him, he said, that he decided to work closely with her.
Still, he said, he met with her for 11 months before deciding to
reveal the pages of missing diary material _ three sides of two
blue sheets and both sides of a salmon-colored sheet.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ms. Muller's biography, Otto Frank had been
intensely in love with a wealthy young woman in Frankfurt whose
parents ruled out the marriage on financial grounds, leaving him
heartbroken and devoid of passion for Edith, as Anne may have
learned.
</P>
<P>
   In the diary revision on the blue sheets, dated Feb. 8, 1944,
when she was 14, Anne, addressing her fictional friend Kitty, talks
about going through a period of reflection centering on her
parents' marriage, always presented to her as ``ideal.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But she says she knows ``a thing or two'' about her father's
past and, supplemented by her imagination, concludes that her
father married her mother because ``he deemed her the right person
to be his wife.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I must say that I admire my mother for the way she has filled
that position without a murmur and without jealousy, as far as I
can tell,'' Anne continues.
</P>
<P>
   Farther along she says, ``Father is not in love, he gives her a
kiss the way he kisses us.''
</P>
<P>
   As for her mother, Anne says: ``Quite possibly because of her
great sacrifice Mother has grown hard and disagreeable toward her
surroundings and, consequently, she will drift further and further
away from the path of love, will gain less and less admiration and,
no doubt, Father will eventually come to realize that because
externally she has never claimed his full love, she has crumbled
away bit by bit internally. She loves him more than anybody else
and it is hard to see this kind of love unanswered time and
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Hence, she says, shouldn't she feel compassion for her mother?
``Should I help her? And my father?''
</P>
<P>
   No, she decides. Her mother has never told Anne about herself,
nor has Anne asked her to; she describes a silence of near
strangers. ``I am unable to talk with her, I cannot look lovingly
into those cold eyes. I cannot, never! _ If she had only one aspect
of an understanding mother, either tenderness or kindness, or
patience or something else, I would keep trying to approach her.
But, as the days go by, I find myself more and more unable to love
this insensitive nature and mocking countenance. Yours Anne.''
</P>
<P>
   The salmon-colored sheet was Anne's revision of an introduction
to the diary. Promising to be a diligent diarist, she says, ``I
shall also take care that nobody can lay hands on it.'' Her parents
and her sister Margot may be confidants, she says, ``yet my diary
and the secrets I share with my friends are none of their
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Anne's diary is really a succession of books and loose pages.
She had been given an autograph book, bound in red-and-green
checkered cloth and secured with a simple key-less lock, for her
13th birthday, on June 12, 1942, a month before the family went
into hiding.
</P>
<P>
   Within six months, Anne had filled the makeshift diary, going on
to a second notebook, which was lost, and two following notebooks.
These became known as version ``A.''
</P>
<P>
   After hearing a Dutch radio broadcast urging citizens to
preserve their histories of the war, Anne, over a period of two and
a half months starting in May 1944, feverishly began revising her
diary, re-writing 324 pages, perhaps as as the basis for a novel.
This became known as version ``B.''
</P>
<P>
   After the annex was raided that August, Anne's writings were
preserved by a downstairs secretary and friend who had bravely kept
their secret, Miep Gies, now 89. When Otto Frank, liberated at the
Auschwitz death camp, returned to Amsterdam and learned that Anne
and her elder sister Margot had died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen
concentration camp in early 1945, weeks before the British
liberation, she presented him the diaries.
</P>
<P>
   Otto Frank released a heavily edited version of ``B'' for its
first publication as ``Anne Frank: Diary of a Young Girl'' in 1947.
That became known as version ``C.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, the Institute for War Documentation in Amsterdam, which
had been given custody of the diaries, published a so-called
critical edition, comparing the versions, with scientific analysis,
to refute any claims they were forgeries.
</P>
<P>
   A footnote to the ``A'' version acknowledged the omission, at
the family's request, of a 47-line segment that gave ``an extremely
unkind and particularly unfair picture of her parents' marriage.''
But in the ``B'' version there was no mention of anything missing _
the 47 lines of revisions Frank withheld.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Doubleday, now part of Random House, came out with a
``definitive edition'' timed to the 50th anniversary of Anne's
death and including 30 percent more material than Otto Frank had
allowed for the originally published ``C'' version. But the
definitive edition also lacked the revised entries that have now
emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Applebaum, senior vice president at Random House, said
``we are as disturbed and nonplussed as anybody'' but said any move
to republish the book with the missing material would have to await
a resolution of the legal claims. ``It's impossible for us to get
beyond the rancor now,'' he said. Doubleday, which has North
American hardcover publication rights to the diary, and Bantam,
which has paperback rights, would not expect to pay additional
money to republish with the new material, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Romijn, head of research for the Institute for War
Documentation, said that as it happened, a new printing of the
critical edition had been planned anyway and now should include the
new material.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Muller said she learned only in June that she would not be
given permission to quote the new material in her book, a decision
she attributed to commercial considerations as well as a misguided
effort to protect Otto Frank.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not terrible that a 36-year-old man may have had an
earlier love,'' she said. Besides, she said, ``I don't care what
their marriage was like. I care about the relationship of mother
and daughter.''

 By ERIC A. TAUB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You've just decided to be not only the first on your
block, but the first in your city to buy one of those new digital
high-definition televisions. You don't mind taking out a second
mortgage and building an extra room to house your new $10,000 HDTV,
because you're eager to watch all the new super-sharp wide-screen
programs and the extra channels.
</P>
<P>
   But come Nov. 1, when digital programming begins, the question
might be not just which shows to watch, but how in the world to
find them all.
</P>
<P>
   In the rush to get digital transmissions, including HDTV, on the
air, a few small matters were left on the table _ like what to name
these new channels and how to steer viewers to them. That is an
issue because when the Federal Communications Commission allocated
every television network a second channel last year for the
transition to digital broadcasting, those new frequencies were
often nowhere near their corresponding analog frequencies.
</P>
<P>
   The problem becomes worse when a network or local station,
looking to make extra profits from advertising, decides to use its
new digital channel for four channels with ordinary picture quality
instead of one HDTV feed. What, for example, should the program
streams on a network's new four-channel digital feed be called?
Does each separate channel get new call letters?
</P>
<P>
   Before you postpone your HDTV purchase for fear that you will
never find anything, don't worry. It looks as though the problem
will be solved, even though the FCC has yet to take final action.
Last December, the Advanced Television Systems Committee, an
industry group, suggested to the government that if a network
decides to divide its digital channel into several programming
streams, each should be considered as part of the main number.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if a network decided to split its new digital
channel into four during the daytime for separate feeds of news,
sports, children's and soap opera programs, they would all use the
number for the main analog channel.
</P>
<P>
   If the network was CBS, for example, in New York City CBS would
still appear to be broadcasting at the top of the dial, on Channel
2. (There has never been a Channel 1, because the frequency
represented by that number has always been assigned to the
government.)
</P>
<P>
   Each of the four channels would also have a subnumber: The
sports service could be Channel 2-1, the soap opera service Channel
2-4 and so on. If all the bandwidth was being used for one HDTV
feed, it would be plain Channel 2.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike radio, which names its channels by the actual frequency,
like 1010 or 95.5, television channel numbering is arbitrary. The
television channel numbers 2, 3, etc., indicate only where the
channels lie on the dial, not frequencies.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's proposal also suggests a way for the network
affiliates to hang on to the cachet of the positions they now hold
on the analog dial. Even though NBC's Channel 4 in Los Angeles has
been reassigned to the Siberia of frequencies on the digital dial,
there is no reason that any viewer ever need know this.
</P>
<P>
   Under the committee's scheme, the true digital channel
assignments will be invisible. Instead, every time viewers hit the
old familiar Channel 4 on their digital-television remote controls,
the receivers will be programmed to find the new digital frequency
assignment _ even if it's actually Channel 65 or Channel 99. Data
sent along with the television signal will tell the digital
receiver where to look for the channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still haven't heard from the FCC regarding this proposal,''
said Craig Tanner, the executive director of the Advanced
Television Systems Committee. ``But it's not clear that they have
any interest in acting on it. However, all indications are that the
broadcasters and set manufacturers intend to use it.''
</P>
<P>
   John Tollefson, vice president and chief technology officer at
PBS, explained: ``Under the ATSC's suggested protocol, viewers who
tune into the PBS digital station Channel 26 in Washington, for
example, will then see a menu that asks them which of the Channel
26 feeds they want. It's an issue that will be resolved by the set
manufacturers.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   What the FCC has decided is that all digital channels will keep
the call letters now used for their current analog service and will
just add a suffix to indicate that it is a digital service. That is
good news for the United States' broadcast television and radio
stations, who have long promoted their call letters and channel
positions as important signposts in getting viewers to their
stations. The letters WCBS in New York, KTLA in Los Angeles and WGN
in Chicago are valuable franchises to their owners.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC says the entire digital feed of WABC in New York, for
example, will be known as WABC-DT (for Digital Television), whether
the station is broadcasting three or four feeds on the digital
channel during the day or one feed with high-definition programs at
night.
</P>
<P>
   When digital television hits its stride, major markets could be
looking at scores of additional channels and hundreds of additional
shows. So if you think your TV Guide is thick today, just wait a
few more years.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that viewers will rebel against printed program
listings the size of the Manhattan phone directory, all digital
transmissions will be encoded with a show's name, length and start
time. New digital sets will use that information to assemble and
display an on-screen electronic program grid covering nine hours.
Soon, programming your VCR will be easier than figuring out what to
watch.

CONSTITUTION INTENTIONALLY VAGUE ON IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr's report
concludes that President Clinton may have committed impeachable
offenses. But David Kendall, Clinton's attorney, who hasn't read
the report, said he was certain of one thing: The president did not
commit impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Both men could be right because of the Constitution's vague
wording. There is no simple definition of an impeachable offense.
Moreover, the Constitution's requirement that impeachment requires
proof of ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' is misleading because the
phrase historically does not refer to a specific criminal
violation.
</P>
<P>
   Some legal scholars say a president could be impeached even if
there is no proof crimes were committed. As then-Representative
Gerald Ford said in 1970 when he was trying to oust Supreme Court
Justice William O. Douglas, impeachment is ``whatever a majority of
the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment
in history.''
</P>
<P>
   At this moment, House Republicans want to gauge the public
reaction to Starr's report, and then see if there is support for
impeachment. That will be especially important if the report
contains weak evidence that laws were broken but does have clear
proof that Clinton abused his power.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, when the House Judiciary Committee was considering the
impeachment of President Nixon, the panel's staff concluded a
president could be impeached even if he doesn't commit actual
``high crimes and misdemeanors'' as defined by current law.
Instead, the committee's report said a president could be ousted
for his ``course of conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those staff members was a young lawyer named Hillary
Rodham, who is now the first lady. Twenty-four years later,
Republicans say that staff report holds an ominous message for
President Clinton: It may not be enough for Clinton to prove that
he didn't commit a crime. Instead, his conduct may be on trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The founders left it intentionally vague,'' said
Representative James Rogan, a California Republican who recently
conducted a GOP study on past impeachments.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's founders made clear that impeachment was a
political act, not a judicial one, legal scholars said. As the
House Judiciary Committee wrote when it was considering Nixon's
impeachment in 1974, ``the phrase `high crimes and misdemeanors'
has been used in English impeachment cases to charge officials with
a wide range of criminal and non-criminal offenses.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, there has been little public attention paid to the fact
that the Judiciary Committee could approve articles of impeachment
even if there is no proof Clinton broke any laws. Most of the
emphasis has been on whether Clinton committed perjury or
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   But Representative Bob Barr, a Georgia Republican who has drawn
attention to Mrs. Clinton's role in the 1974 report, said Congress
would be justified in impeaching the president for non-criminal
offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know, by review of the public, historical record, that
impeachment was never intended to address criminal offenses,'' Barr
wrote earlier this year to House members. ``Rather, it was
explicitly to address abuse of office or abuse of power.''
</P>
<P>
   In order to come up with a standard for impeachment, Rogan said
Republicans are looking at both the Constitution and precedent.
</P>
<P>
   The Nixon articles of impeachment, Republicans note, contained a
number of general items that could apply to the Clinton case.
Nixon, for example, was accused in the first article of ``making or
causing to be made false or misleading statements to lawfully
authorized officers and employees of the United States.'' Nixon was
also accused of withholding evidence and condoning false statements
by others.
</P>
<P>
   To Republicans, the same wording might be applied in the Clinton
case, in which the president said under oath that he did not have
an affair with former White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky.
Clinton later admitted having an inappropriate relationship, which
aides said involved an unspecified type of sexual activity.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers are preparing to argue that Clinton's
relationship with Lewinsky was a personal matter that did not
affect his ability to govern and did not break any laws. Moreover,
the president's defenders said, there is no evidence that Clinton
matched the most serious allegations against Nixon, such as
misusing the Central Intelligence Agency or approving payoffs to
keep witnesses silent.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans said the Clinton White House is mistaken if it
thinks the president will avoid impeachment even if Starr does not
come up with evidence that Clinton broke laws.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Republicans noted that Alexander Hamilton, writing in
the Federalist Papers, seemed to foresee the type of investigation
now being made into Clinton's actions. Hamilton described
impeachment as ``a method of national inquest into the conduct of
public men.'' A court of impeachment will ``doom to honor or to
infamy the most confidential and the most distinguished characters
of the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies a quandary for Republicans. The GOP strategy is to
assure the public that it is performing a constitutional duty, not
a partisan act. But in deciding whether to try to impeach Clinton,
they must follow political precedents, not case law.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Congress take a partisan approach rather than a
constitutional approach, then history will judge us harshly,'' said
Rogan, a former municipal judge.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Baron, an attorney who brought the impeachment case of US
Judge Alcee Hastings before the Senate during the 1980s, noted that
Hastings was acquitted of criminal charges in a judicial
proceeding. But that didn't stop Congress from impeaching and
ousting Hastings, who went on to become a member of the US House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impeachment and removal from office in the US is not a
criminal process,'' Baron said. ``It is not an indictment. It is a
system for removing public officials who are regarded as no longer
worthy of holding a position of public trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Baron, who last year worked as Democratic counsel for the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee, stressed that he does not think
Clinton's case has risen to a level that requires the impeachment
of the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people at large have to feel that this is what should
occur,'' Baron said. So far, Baron said, polls show that the public
doesn't feel that way. The question is whether that view will
change after Starr's report on Clinton's actions is released.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The United States' broadcasters use their call
letters like vanity license plates. Call letters, a 19th-century
invention, are still a quick way to give viewers a sense of the
station's persona.
</P>
<P>
   Call letters were originally created so telegraph operators
could send messages to ships and other parties without having to
spell out the entire name of the recipient with every
communication. With the advent of radio, they became an easy way to
carve out a station's identity.
</P>
<P>
   The international assignment of call letters was codified in
1912 at the London International Radiotelegraphic Conference.
German channels would begin with A or D (for Deutschland) or use
KAA to KCZ. British stations would start with a B or M, while
French channels would use the letter F.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently asleep at the wheel, the United States received the
meaningless letters KDA to KZZ, as well as N (used for Navy and
Coast Guard stations), and W. In 1929, it received the rest of the
K combinations, which had originally been allocated to Germany.
</P>
<P>
   With their historically small number of local television and
radio stations, few nations outside the United States, Canada and
Mexico bother using their assigned call letters, identifying their
stations by name only, like France's TF1, Germany's ARD, or
Britain's BBC1, BBC2 and London Weekend Television.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, radio call signs were initially three
letters, assigned in order on a first-come, first-served basis. By
the early 1920s, three-letter codes had begun to run out, so the
government switched to four-letter signs.
</P>
<P>
   A station's call sign begins with a W if it is east of the
Mississippi River and with K if it is west of there. The 30 or so
stations named before this rule, like KDKA and KYW in Philadelphia,
and WHO in Des Moines, were allowed to keep their call signs.
</P>
<P>
   Until December 1983, the Federal Communications Commission
controlled call-letter assignments. Call signs, which could now be
requested, nevertheless had to be in good taste, the regulations
said, and ``sufficiently dissimilar phonetically and rhythmically
from existing call signs of stations in the same service area so
that there will be no significant likelihood of public confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulations originally prohibited a station from using
the initials of any living president or of the United States or its
agencies or departments.
</P>
<P>
   By 1984, the FCC got out of the station-identification
censorship business. Stations could now call themselves KFBI
(Wichita, Kan.) or WJFK (Washington) if they wished. Matters of
taste would be handled by the courts, not the federal government.
For a number of years, one station in the West used as its call
letters a four-letter profanity spelled backward).
</P>
<P>
   Still, call signs technically remain the property of the
government, preventing a secondary market in call-sign trading from
developing. But once a station knows that another station is about
to relinquish a call sign it covets, it can arrange to be tipped
off so it can file an application for the sign just moments after
it is turned in.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 1922, stations could request specific call letters.
The first custom combination went to the Detroit Police Department,
which named its station KOP.
</P>
<P>
   Whether a station's call letters or its meaning came first is
often open to debate, and a host of amateur call-letter historians
have sprung up to chronicle all the permutations; comprehensive
listings of call-letter meanings and origins are provided at
www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/6375/origins.html and at
www.ipass.net/whitetho/recap.htm.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, WABD (Channel 5) was named after a television
network pioneer, Allen B. DuMont. The station's call letters were
later changed to WNEW and then WNYW. WOR's initials stood for
Wonders (or World) of Radio, while the Big Three networks
capitalized on their own initials in naming their local outlets
WABC, WCBS and WNBC.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, KNX Radio was named that because its office was
in the annex next to the studio's original home. KHJ (now KRTH)
stood for Kindness, Hope, and Joy, the names of three canaries
whose chirping was used on radio broadcasts, while KTTV, once owned
by The Los Angeles Times, stood for Times Television.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, an Arlington Heights, Ill., station used the call
letters WSEX to attract attention, according to a broadcast
engineering consultant and amateur call-letter historian, Barry
Mishkind, of Phoenix. New York's WEVD got its name from the
socialist Eugene V. Debs, while Buffalo's WKBW picked up its
moniker from its evangelical owner, Clinton Churchill, who liked
the idea of an acronym for Well-Known Bible Witness.
</P>
<P>
   In Cicero, Ill., the letters of WVON, the AM station, stood for
Voice of the Negro, according to Bob Nelson, the lead software
developer of On Air USA and another call-sign historian who lives
in Dallas and runs the Geocities site listed above. The station was
bought by the Harlem Globetrotters' organization and moved to
Chicago and renamed WGCI for Globetrotter Communications.
Similarly, WNOV in Wisconsin stands for Wisconsin's Negroes' Own
Voice.
</P>
<P>
   WLBB Radio in Carrollton, Ga., was so named because the original
owner agreed that ``we love butter beans.'' KFWB in Los Angeles was
named after its original owners, the Four Warner Brothers. Its
slogan, Keep Filming Warner Brothers, was modified during World War
II to Keep Fighting, Warner Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   WTRC (Truth Radio Co.) in Elkhart, Ind., metamorphosed into WTFF
of Virginia, owned by the publisher of The Fellowship Forum, a Ku
Klux Klan publication. The station was sold and its call letters
changed in 1943 to WTOP in Washington (at 1500kHz, the top of the
dial), Mishkind said.
</P>
<P>
   Other unusual call signs include KSBW (Salad Bowl of the World)
in Salinas, Calif.; WTTW-TV (Windows to the World) in Chicago; WZPR
(the home of the inventor of the zipper) in Meadville, Pa., and
KSHE in St. Louis, which once had an all-female staff.

   WASHINGTON _ Nervous-Nellie candidates, hand-wringing
opinionmongers and parents doing a national slow burn should stop
calling on President Clinton to resign. Quitting under 36 boxes of
evidence is not The American Way.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it in Bill Clinton's character. The most authentic moment
of his presidency was his defiant assertion last month of
wrongdoing and victimhood. With no phony lip-biting or spurious
apology, he delivered his essential message: I regret that I was
caught, but it's my private life so get over it.
</P>
<P>
   That true baring of his soul was soon inundated by leaks from
his frustrated speechwriters of their rejected draft, which
expressed sorrow and apologized to all including Monica.
</P>
<P>
   His stalwart wife had rejected such self-flagellation. Let
Clinton be Clinton, advised Hillary, and the nation got a
four-minute glimpse of the real man reading his own words and legal
evasions. In return, the president _ with unremarked gallantry _
pretended to have lied to his wife for seven months after the
scandal broke, thereby giving cover to her vast-conspiracy defense
when they thought the charges could not be ``proven true.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the summer soldiers and sunshine spinmeisters of his White
House are demanding repeated repentance and the upward calibration
of contrition so that at least the Democratic base will forgive.
</P>
<P>
   But faked remorse demeans the office and earns no absolution.
Let Clinton stay Clinton. Let him stick with his ``indefensible''
defense, play on the distaste of Americans at sustained
self-abasement by their leader, and make clear that resignation is
not an option no matter what embarrassment the Starr revelations
bring.
</P>
<P>
   Why this, from a pundit who has been railing for two years that
Clinton stole the 1996 election with illegal Asian-connection
money?
</P>
<P>
   Some will say my perverse support is rooted in a desire for a
president to be twisting in the wind during the fall campaign,
damaging Democrats who fail to denounce him with poll-driven
ferocity. Others may attribute it to a partisan concern that Al
Gore, global-warming the presidential chair, would win election by
acting boldly against Iraq and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Still others will say opponents of resignation long for an
inactivist executive branch, devoid of a spending agenda, too weak
to deny Congress' tax cuts to the deserving nouveau riche. Another
ulterior motive: we may await the spectacle of a parade of wronged
or ill-used women being savaged by Judiciary Committee Democrats,
with psychic wounds later dressed by a fatherly Hyde.
</P>
<P>
   No, Virginia, your little friends are wrong, affected by the
cynicism of a CNN-ical age.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton should stay right where he is because the people elect
presidents directly for a fixed term of four years. Our decision
cannot be reversed by a parliamentary vote of no confidence.
Resigning _ even entertaining the idea on the excuse of the
appearance of paralysis to the world _ weakens the office and
undermines the system.
</P>
<P>
   That system, as we have seen, can take a lot of punishment. If
the 36 boxes containing two sets of evidence that Ken Starr
delivered Wednesday go beyond sexual misbehavior to show a pattern
of abuse of power, the House will publish as much as decency
permits and begin its impeachment inquiry at a dignified pace.
</P>
<P>
   We'll have an undisturbed mid-term election (the U.S. held an
orderly presidential election even during a civil war). The next
Congress will hold its open hearings and do its duty. If Clinton
remains in office, we will examine a new Independent Counsel's
evidence of far greater abuse of power in the stolen '96 election.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bill Clinton is the fully empowered president. He
will light the national Christmas tree, give the State of the Union
address and respond to national security threats. Just as in the
armed forces, where the uniform and not the person rates the
salute, Americans will continue to respect Clinton the president no
matter what they think of Clinton the man.
</P>
<P>
   After years of contemptuous stonewalling, followed by months of
salacious lip-smacking, a sense of solemnity is settling over the
capital. Impeachment is too profoundly political for politics.
</P>
<P>
   Our elected officials and press and public can digest and act
upon the Starr report while running the country and leading the
world. Nobody flinches; nobody rushes; nobody quits.

L.A. COUNCIL VOTES CURB ON OUTDOOR ADS FOR ALCOHOL, TOBACCO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Md., Ill.)   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The City Council on Wednesday passed a law that
will virtually eliminate outdoor alcohol and tobacco advertising in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In a hearing attended by hundreds of elementary and high-school
students as well as lawyers for the beer, billboard advertising and
tobacco industries and advocates for grocers' associations, the
City Council unanimously voted a ban encompassing billboards,
grocery store windows and other outdoor venues within 1,000 feet of
schools, parks and residential areas.
</P>
<P>
   The ban, one of the most restrictive in the nation, will
practically remove alcohol and tobacco advertisements from an
estimated 98 percent of the city's billboards. About one-fourth of
the land in industrial areas will still be allowed to carry such
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colleagues, we have a simple choice before us,'' Councilman
Mike Feuer, who sponsored the measure. ``Are we going to put our
kids first or are we going to put alcohol, tobacco and billboard
companies first?'' He later answered his own question: ``Let's
cater to our kids. Lets put our kids first.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they fully expected the city to be sued over the
law, which will take effect one year after it is signed by Mayor
Richard Riordan, who has voiced support for it.
</P>
<P>
   Legal challenges to similar measures in other cities have so far
met with mixed results, with laws in Baltimore and Oakland being
upheld while Chicago's was struck down.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union chapter here sent a letter to
one council member Tuesday opposing the measure, though the lawyer
who drafted the letter said the group had not decided whether it
will file suit if the law goes into effect.
</P>
<P>
   H. Joseph Escher, a lawyer representing the R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Co., told the council that its proposed version was
identical to the Chicago law recently rejected by a U.S. District
Court, and that the Los Angeles ordinance violated the intent of
Congress to prevent a ``hodgepodge'' of varying local restrictions
on advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Baldonado, a representative of Anheuser-Busch Cos., said
at Wednesday's hearing that his company was a good corporate
citizen, not to mention the largest water customer in the city, and
was ``disappointed'' to have to defend its right to advertise. Rex
Heinke, a lawyer representing Eller Media, a billboard company,
said the laws were discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is government censorship pure and simple,'' Heinke said.
``The council is launching the city on a slippery slope.''
</P>
<P>
   But students who spoke at the hearing said the tobacco and beer
companies were targeting them _ especially in minority communities
_ before it is legal for them to buy either substance. High-school
students from Pacoima, a low-income area, complained that tobacco
billboards lined their streets, including those by their schools.

HOUSE REPUBLICANS TO SEEK BIG TAX CUT FROM BUDGET SURPLUS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Adds optional 2NDTAKE with 10 new grafs of comments,
additional details.)  (th) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republican leaders challenged the heart of
President Clinton's domestic policy strategy Wednesday, saying they
would press for a tax cut worth up to $80 billion over five years
and pay for it by dipping into projected federal budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   Their decision puts House Republicans _ already considering
impeachment proceedings against the president _ on another
collision course with the White House. Clinton has insisted that
the surplus be set aside until Congress and the administration have
agreed on a plan to shore up the ailing Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   For most of this year Clinton's ``save Social Security first''
strategy had kept Republicans from pursuing a big tax cut paid for
by the budget surpluses, which are projected to reach more than
$1.5 trillion over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans, especially in the House, have grown
increasingly willing to push for a tax cut, in part because of
their perception that Clinton is politically weakened and
distracted and in part because of polling suggesting that voters
think Congress can cut taxes and still have plenty of money left to
save Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton again warned Republicans on Wednesday that tapping the
surpluses before they actually materialize was fiscally
irresponsible. Eager to change the subject from Monica Lewinsky,
White House officials clearly were happy at the prospect of a
policy fight that would play to the historical Democratic strength
as defender of the Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a mistake for us to go out and have an election-year
gimmick to please people,'' Clinton said in an address to Democrats
in Florida, ``no matter how pleasing it would be, with a tax cut
until we have saved Social Security for the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Senate Republicans remain wary of challenging Clinton on
the issue, and it is unclear whether the Senate will even take up a
tax cut of any size in the few weeks remaining before Congress
adjourns early next month.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Newt Gingrich and other Republican leaders in the House,
however, believe that it will be hard for the Senate not to act if
the House passes a tax-cut bill in the next several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this summer, Gingrich had been pushing for a much bigger
tax cut, but Wednesday he said he would settle on a smaller package
this year in the hopes of pushing through a more ambitious
reduction next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think somewhere in the $70 to $80 billion range would be the
most likely tax cut this fall,'' Gingrich told a news conference
Wednesday afternoon after meeting with his leadership team,
referring to the value of the tax cut over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the tax cut would be completely financed by using
the surplus, Gingrich replied, ``Virtually all of it, yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means
Committee, is drafting a tax bill for the Republicans, and could
have it ready for consideration by the committee at the end of next
week, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill will probably include a tax cut for some two-income
couples, tax breaks for farmers and ranchers who have been hit hard
by an economic downturn in agriculture, and an increase in the
income that retirees can earn without losing some of their Social
Security benefits.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are also considering changes to the alternative
minimum tax, which is intended to insure that wealthy people do not
escape taxes through shelters and other sophisticated strategies,
but which now applies to growing numbers of middle-income people.
Archer has also supported allowing self-employed people to deduct
more of their health-insurance costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people today are having a bigger percentage of
the GDP taken away from them in federal taxes than at any time in
peacetime history,'' Archer said. ``That's why we have a surplus.
And we believe that it's appropriate to save Social Security and to
give back part of that to badly hit Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the looming confrontation over taxes, Congress
appears headed toward a showdown with the White House over the
spending bills needed to keep the government operating. The
administration has issued veto threats against seven bills as
passed by the House and two of the Senate versions.
</P>
<P>
   With the start of a new fiscal year on Oct. 1, both parties are
taking seriously the possibility that a standoff could lead to a
partial shutdown of the government.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob Lew, the White House budget director, said a tax cut that
is paid for by the surplus would be ``inviting the kind of
confrontation we all hope to avoid,'' although he said the White
House would be happy to consider a tax cut that is paid for by
offsetting spending cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Lew said it would be up to the Republicans to decide whether to
seek a confrontation over the spending bills, which seek to cut
financing for many of Clinton's priorities or reshape policy in
areas like education and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Before Clinton's problems over his relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky escalated to the point of threatening his presidency,
Democrats had looked forward to debating Republicans on the
campaign trail this fall over taxes, spending and the best way to
help save the Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   But with Washington's attention focused on Clinton's battle with
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, it is unclear how much political
mileage either party will squeeze from budget issues.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said they were not seeking a confrontation
with Republicans over taxes and spending as a way of deflecting
attention from Clinton's other problems, but that if a
confrontation took place they believed they could prevail on the
merits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see no lessening of resolve to pursue these issues and no
lessening of public concern over these issues,'' Lew said.

 &HT;    STARR REPORT DROPPED OFF AT CAPITOL
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``All this press for this?'' marveled Sam Jassin, a
tourist from Milwaukee watching hundreds of photographers and TV
cameramen capture the high drama of police officers moving boxes in
and out of vans.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was almost as if Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr
just up and decided after a four-year investigation to send some of
his guys over to the Capitol on a sunny Wednesday afternoon to drop
off the report that could lead to the impeachment of President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonder why Starr didn't come himself?'' asked Jane Jassin,
Sam's wife.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't recognize the names or faces of Charles Bakaly and
Robert Bittman, Starr staffers who delivered the report the world
has awaited since January, when Clinton was first accused of having
a sexual affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky and
engaging in an illegal cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Starr has some things he's doing,'' Bakaly later told
reporters. ``No significance one way or the other to draw from
that.''
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., also had some other things
going on this historic afternoon. Around 4 p.m., when two vans
carrying the 500-page report and 36 boxes of evidence arrived at
the east steps of the Capitol, Gingrich was at a Republican
leadership meeting in the nearby Library of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   So, after turning over the boxes to Sergeant at Arms Wilson
Livingood, Bakaly and Bittman set out to inform Gingrich and House
Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., that the deed was done.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by 18 armed and uniformed Capitol police officers,
including one in a bicycle helmet, Starr's spokesmen carried
letters of transmittal first to Gingrich at the Library of Congress
and then back to Gephardt in his Capitol office. As this stern
little parade marched around the grounds, it was joined by a
handful of curious tourists, several TV crews and a few print
reporters. But most of the on-lookers remained near the House of
Representatives, at a grassy area where Bakaly had promised to
speak after making his deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have fulfilled our duty,'' he proclaimed upon arrival.
</P>
<P>
   When Congress will get it's first peek at what's inside the
boxes, he was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is in their custody and control now. It is now no longer in
our custody,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The first official word that history was about to happen came at
3:45 p.m. when Starr's office called the House Judiciary Committee
to say the documents were on the way. Earlier in the day, House
leaders had instructed aides to call the independent counsel's
office to inquire about the long-awaited report.
</P>
<P>
   Word spread across Washington and the grounds across from the
House were filled with hundreds of journalists, congressional
staffers and tourists when the vans arrived in 15 minutes. ``Take
your positions,'' Capitol Police Chief Dan Nichols joked to the
photographers jockeying for good angles.
</P>
<P>
   With the House Sergeant at Arms carefully counting, Capitol
police officers moved every box from Starr's vans to a
congressional vehicle. Then the documents were driven to a secured
room in a nearby House office building.
</P>
<P>
   The room will be guarded and sealed until the House decides how
to proceed. ``None of us will have access to that room until we
write the rules for handling the material,'' Gingrich told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first congressional step toward what could be a
long impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   Watching all those boxes being moved, an aide to Judiciary
Committee chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill. said: ``I saw Christmas going
down the toilet.''

INS TREATS DETAINED IMMIGRANTS LIKE CRIMINALS, REPORT SAYS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MIRTA OJITO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thousands of immigrants and political refugees are in U.S.
jails, mixed with criminals and often treated as such, because the
Immigration and Naturalization Service has no other place to hold
them while they await deportation or a resolution of their status,
according to a human rights report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The scathing 84-page report by Human Rights Watch also found
that friction between the detainees and jail officials has led to
riots, prison escapes, beatings and, on several occasions, the
conviction of jailers who have abused detainees to the point of
violating their civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch researchers, who visited 14 jails and
communicated with hundreds of detainees over 18 months, say the INS
is to blame for the conditions because, in its desperate search for
places to hold immigrants, the agency ships them to city and county
jails over which it has no control.
</P>
<P>
   The jails visited by the researchers are in Pennsylvania,
Virginia, Texas, Illinois, Florida, Maryland and Louisiana. The
report found that detainees receive poor medical and dental care,
have little access to lawyers and virtually no communication with
jailers because of language barriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that INS is handing over its administrative duties to
facilities for convicted criminals is unacceptable,'' said Jennifer
Bailey, who wrote the report and is a research associate in the
Washington office of Human Rights Watch. ``It's a violation of
international standards and a violation of basic human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch, a worldwide organization, has prepared
similar reports about prisoners in other countries, including South
Africa, Turkey and Congo.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued Wednesday afternoon, INS Commissioner
Doris Meissner welcomed the group's recommendations, mainly to
separate detainees from criminals and to stop detaining people
seeking asylum, but stressed that her agency was already monitoring
the local jails it uses to hold detainees.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a facility does not meet our standards and does not take
necessary corrective action, we will not use it,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   INS spokesman Russell Bergeron said 16,000 men and women are
being detained by the agency. Of those, 11,000 are held in local
jails while the rest are held in detention facilities, run by INS,
or in federal prisons administered by the Bureau of Prisons. The
Human Rights Watch researchers are particularly concerned with the
conditions for those being held in local jails.
</P>
<P>
   They are at a disadvantage because there are no federal
regulations or laws that protect them, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``INS has failed to provide oversight or insist on humane
conditions and treatment for its detainees, even though many jail
officials have repeatedly said that, in their facilities,
immigrants and refugees are treated just as if they were regular
inmates,'' Ms. Bailey said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of detainees held by INS has increased in the last
few years as the agency has complied with new laws that expanded
the categories of immigrants that must be detained upon entry or
detained, then deported for crimes committed in the United States.
At the same time, Congress has directed the agency to acquire more
bed space and has allocated money for that purpose. Bergeron said
that in the last three years, the number of beds available has
increased 140 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bergeron said that about 60 percent of the immigrants detained
by INS have committed crimes in the United States and are awaiting
deportation. But he said, 2,600 detainees are in what the agency
calls ``long-term detention'' because their countries will not take
them or because, as with the case with detainees from Cuba and
Southeast Asia, no immigration treaties allow the INS to deport
them.
</P>
<P>
   The long years of detention and the uncertainty about when or
whether detainees will be released, coupled with the poor treatment
in some jails, have led to several violent incidents recently.
</P>
<P>
   The report indicates that detainees in Jackson County Jail in
Florida have accused jail officials of administering electric
shocks on shackled detainees in July. Among other incidents, it
outlines the cases in which nine guards pleaded guilty or were
convicted of abusing detainees in Union County Jail in New Jersey,
and the recent hunger strikes by detainees across the country who
were protesting what they contend was mistreatment or poor
conditions.

CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS DISCUSS RULES TO DEAL WITH REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS BLACK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  WASHINGTON _ Now facing the prospect of a possible
impeachment inquiry against President Clinton, House leaders
Wednesday reached a tentative agreement to make public the report
submitted to Congress Wednesday by independent counsel Kenneth W.
Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strong belief is the public has a right to know,'' said
House Speaker Newt Gingrich after House leaders held their first
closed door meeting on the Starr report Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   But the leaders, just returning from a month-long summer recess,
were caught unprepared by the unexpected delivery of the report to
the Capitol in two vans late Wednesday afternoon. They decided to
put the two full copies of the 500-page report and 36 boxes of
backup materials in a locked vault under armed guard in the Ford
House annex building three blocks south of the Capitol until after
they reach agreement on a game plan. So the documents were
transferred to two other vans and taken to the annex.
</P>
<P>
   The plan for the process was still being drafted Wednesday but
Gingrich said the House Rules Committee could act on a resolution
on procedures for handling the report as soon as Thursday. Rules
Committee action would clear the way for full House action on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt urged the bipartisan
leadership team to adopt the rules used during the last
presidential impeachment proceeding, against Richard M. Nixon 25
years ago, in order to guarantee a fair consideration of the
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next to declaring war, this may be the most important thing we
do, so we have to do it right,'' said Gephardt. ``We have made a
good start at making this a non-partisan effort ...This is a very
large and important responsibility for the Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde said, ``This is a
lousy job but somebody has to do it...We are going to do our level
best to work in a bipartisan fashion. Any impeachment cannot
succeed unless it is conducted in a non-partisan way.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Majority Leader Richard Armey, a particularly harsh critic
of Clinton, said he would brook no partisan outbursts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a serious business,'' said Armey.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders instructed House Judiciary Committee staff to call
Starr's office Wednesday, in the first official contact of the
independent counsel from Capitol Hill, to get a sense of the
content of the report so that the resolution can provide for
disclosure of the bulk of the report but protection of material
that might hurt innocent parties, such as secret grand jury
testimony, said Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders agreed the inquiry would founder if it became mired
in partisanship so they pledged to communicate closely with one
another. The bipartisan meeting, a rarity since Republicans took
control of the House in 1995, reflected deep concern by both
Democrats and Republicans that excessive politicking could hurt the
credibility of Congress in an election year and prevent Congress
from fulfilling its constitutional responsibilities on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am critical of Starr for not giving the president a chance
to respond. It is an indication of his mean spiritedness,'' said
Representative Barney Frank of Massachuetts, the number two
Democrat on the Judiciary Committee. Lawmakers said they believed
Starr accelerated his timetable for delivery of the report to head
off an attempt by Clinton's lawyers to seek a restraining order to
prevent delivery until after Clinton reviewed the report and
prepared a response.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt Wednesday said he thought Clinton should have time to
respond but Gingrich was noncommittal. Gephardt is scheduled to
meet Thursday with Democrats on the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gingrich and Gephardt described their first meeting on the
Starr report Wednesday morning as productive. Gingrich and Gephardt
have had a particularly rocky relationship and speak only on rare
occaisions. The unusual rhetoric of cooperation Wednesday reflected
a sober mood on Capitol Hill. The leaders spoke of the enormity of
the task ahead of them as well as tremendous uneasiness about the
possible political fallout from pursuing the impeachment of a
president whom polls show still enjoys strong public support. Apart
from the most partisan Republicans, few appeared to relish the task
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a serious effort to work together,'' said Gingrich,
who made the same points to Gephardt in an earlier telephone
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   But Gephardt, said an aide, was in a ``trust but verify'' mode
Wednesday and wanted proof that Gingrich would keep his word and
would keep his Republican troops in line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm encouraged that the speaker and majority leader and
Chairman Hyde have pledged to be bipartisan. They seem to recognize
the seriousness of the matter and its importance to the country,''
said Representative Martin Meehan, the Lowell Democrat who serves
on the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   A number of procedural questions remained unresolved Wednesday.
For example, Democrats want to share the power to call witnesses to
testify at hearings and depositions. And Hyde reportedly wants the
exclusive right to rule on assertion of privilege by witnesses.
Meehan said Democrats believe that would concentrate too much power
in one person.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met early Wednesday with Democratic House leaders in an
attempt to shore up his Democratic support on Capitol Hill. The
participants said the president made an extremely emotional apology
to them. The lawmakers said they were moved by his anguished
contrition.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for the leaders, House Democratic Whip David Bonior
said, ``I advised him that he needs to make clear to the American
people in the way he did to us today his contrition, his sorrow for
his actions. He needs to do that not just once. He needs to
understand that this is a process that will be ongoing.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of Capitol Hill, Senator Robert Byrd, at 86
one of the oldest and most senior members of Congress, cautioned
his colleagues: ``We must not compromise any final decision by
rushing to judgment in advance... I urge that we all step back and
give ourselves and the country a little pause in which to reflect
and meditate before we cast ourselves headlong over the
precipice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If sometime in the future the American people should come to
believe that this president or any president has been driven out of
office for what they may perceive to be political reasons, their
wrath will fall upon those who jump to judgment prematurely,'' he
warned.

CAPITOL CAUGHT OFF GUARD BY ARRIVAL OF REPORT, EVIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Finally, it arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr's report had been expected,
even demanded, for months on Capitol Hill. But when Starr's office
called the House Speaker's office at 3:45 p.m. Wednesday to say 36
boxes of evidence that could produce a presidential impeachment
were on the way, everyone was surprised.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Bob Barr, a firebrand Republican from Georgia and
one of President Clinton's fiercest critics, rushed outside the
House to greet the report's arrival and declare it ``truly
historic.'' Barr is a member of the House Judiciary Committee,
which is expected to have jurisdiction over Starr's report and
conduct any initial impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   No other Judiciary members showed up to receive the boxes, nor
did any House leaders venture outside to handle what everybody
knows is a political hot potato. And in the annals of great US
Capitol spectacles, this one _ police moving 36 boxes from one van
to another _ rated low on the sensational scale.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say the somber occasion didn't take on a
circuslike atmosphere. Several hundred reporters and cameras were
on hand to record the event as two vans from Starr's office pulled
up in front of the House's majestic marble steps. Tourists got wind
that the ``Monica'' report was arriving, and they poured out of the
usual attractions on Capitol Hill to line the sidewalks and get a
glimpse of the 36 white cardboard boxes.
</P>
<P>
   A phalanx of Capitol Police cleared the Capitol Plaza and then,
like pallbearers, carefully transferred the boxes to Capitol vans
that would take the secret report to a more secure location _ a
vault in the Ford office building annex, several blocks away.
Speaker Newt Gingrich, who was attending a GOP pep rally in the
nearby Library of Congress when the report arrived, promised the
boxes would have police protection.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the vans carrying the report got a police escort as
they pulled out of the plaza, and a few spectators applauded as
they went by.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Eliot Engel, a liberal Democrat from New York,
had been on the opposite side of the Capitol speaking at a protest
over Kosovo with some 500 Albanian-Americans when the report
arrived. The way the documents were delivered ``stinks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a melodrama, and one that is perfectly consistent with
Ken Starr's lack of impartiality and his partisanship,'' Engel
said. ``This could have been done in a dignified way. Instead it's
a three-ring circus.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't exactly clear why the Independent Counsel's Office
brought the boxes to the most public place at the Capitol when the
report could have been delivered directly to the annex hideaway for
safekeeping. At a brief news conference, Starr spokesman Charles
Bakaly said the independent counsel was simply fulfilling the law
that requires him to advise the House if he ``receives substantial
and credible information of potential impeachable offenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly was pelted with questions about the content of the
report, but he wouldn't disclose anything about what was in the
boxes. Reporters later learned they contained two full sets of the
nearly 500-page report, plus supporting documents.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors that Starr was coming to Capitol Hill proved to be false.
Bakaly and Deputy Independent Counsel Robert Bittman walked from
the Library of Congress to the House, delivering letters of
transmittal to Gingrich and Democratic Minority Leader Richard
Gephardt.

(sw) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democrats on Capitol Hill were spooked on Wednesday
by the arrival of Kenneth Starr's report and two vanloads of
evidence that some fear could topple President Clinton. The more so
because many lawmakers were already frightened _ even panicked _
over how Clinton's denials and delays let the crisis fester and
escalate to the point that it now threatens their own campaigns in
just eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   All day long, Clinton struggled to contain his most immediate
political dilemma: defecting Democrats. He started the day with a
wrenching breakfast at the White House where he apologized to party
leaders, insisting there were no grounds for impeachment. Then in
Florida, he issued a dramatic public apology for the Lewinsky
debacle _ and, once again, asked for forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all his appeals, the signs were hardly reassuring. In
the last few days, a wave of denunciations from Democratic senators
in tough re-election battles combined with the delivery of the
report by Starr, the Whitewater independent prosecutor, has helped
fuel a growing sense in the White House and among Democrats in
Congress that the party may not have time to recover, at least
before the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing is spiraling out of control,'' said a senior
adviser to Clinton, who has spoken at length with the president
this week. Ticking off the list of senators who have condemned
Clinton in recent days, he said, ``These guys are all worried about
their own election.'' He added, ``They're all fair weather
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the distancing dance continued in Florida, where
Sen. Bob Graham, who is seeking re-election, stayed clear of events
with the president, as did Gov. Lawton Chiles. On the Senate floor,
Sen. Robert Byrd Jr. of West Virginia was the latest Democrat to
step forward. He suggested that as happened in Watergate, the
coverup has propelled the crisis further than the original
misdeeds. ``We seem to be living history all over again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, some Democrats tried to sound upbeat as the Starr
report arrived on Wednesday afternoon. But privately, a Democratic
leadership aide in Congress, asked to assess Clinton's prospects,
offered a gloomy response that seemed rather typical: ``Forty
percent chance he's gone. Gone. Gone. But with this guy, he's hard
to predict. He's Houdini.''
</P>
<P>
   In another ominous sign, the first incumbent Republican in the
House, Helen Chenoweth of Idaho, began running television
commercials denouncing Clinton. In one advertisement, Ms. Chenoweth
addresses her opponent, Dan Williams, and says: ``Bill Clinton's
behavior has severely rocked this nation and damaged the Office of
the President. I believe that personal conduct and integrity does
matter. Where do you stand, Dan?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has long had a strained relationship with Democrats in
Congress. But many Democrats said he compounded the political risk
by brazenly assuring the American people in January that he did not
have a relationship with Monica Lewinsky _ and by not offering an
abject confession in his address to the nation on Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been better for him to take responsibility at
the earliest possible time,'' Sen. Barbara Boxer of California, who
is facing a tough re-election battle, said shortly before the
report arrived on Capitol Hill. ``I knew the truth was going to
come out from the beginning, so I think it would have been better
if he had stepped up and just told the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   If this were a typical election year, Rep. Dick Gephardt and
Sen. Thomas Daschle, the Democratic leaders in the House and
Senate, would be spending these crucial days meeting with
strategists and candidates, plotting how best to capitalize on the
party's stands on education, Social Security and health care.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Daschle has devoted much of the past several days
begging Democratic senators _ with little success _ not to stand up
on the Senate floor and castigate Clinton. And instead of spreading
upbeat prognostications to Democratic contenders about the party's
prospects of retaking the House, Gephardt has been closeted in his
office fielding calls from scared candidates who fear that the
Lewinsky debacle could hit them like a cyclone.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really can't care about Democrats running for Congress if
you're waiting until August to admit you were lying,'' said Brian
Lunde, a former executive director of the Democratic Party, and a
longtime critic of Clinton. ``He's always thought personal victory
_ not party victory.''
</P>
<P>
   One Democratic congressional leadership aide, speaking of the
president's relationship with lawmakers in his party, also said
Clinton had needlessly dragged out the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never liked the guy in the first place,'' he said.
``They've dug a very deep hole, all of which basically goes back to
the initial lie. Why should we believe the White House spin? Those
same people told me personally six months ago, `He didn't lie about
Lewinsky.'''
</P>
<P>
   Had Clinton been more contrite on Aug. 17, the aide said, ``That
would have gone a long way. He would have bought himself a
tremendous amount of goodwill. Part of his problem now is he needs
some time. He's reeling.''
</P>
<P>
   One example of how Clinton has deepened his own difficulties is
that many Democrats who have turned on him were already facing
tight re-election contests; there was no independent polling
evidence that his own scandal was dragging down senators such as
Ms. Boxer of California, Carol Moseley-Braun of Illinois and Ernest
Hollings of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have yet to see any real data supporting `the sky is falling
theory,''' said one adviser to many Democratic campaigns, who
explained that some candidates were so nervous that they did not
want to wait to read the Starr report before rendering their
verdict on the president. ``But everybody wants somebody to lash
out at.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats who have not spoken out have counseled that they
want first to read the Starr report. But even that may be a
troubling sign for Clinton because Democrats are no longer
automatically issuing partisan attacks on Starr, as they did for
months.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Clinton's loyalists seem to be dwindling by the day,
one of his remaining friends on Wednesday recalled the supposed
words of President Harry Truman: ``If you want a friend in
Washington, buy a dog.''

STARR REPORT'S ARRIVAL CAUGHT CAPITOL HILL BY SURPRISE

 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The much-anticipated report by Kenneth Starr, the
independent counsel, arrived on a sun-splotched Capitol Hill on
Wednesday with all the warning of a bolt of lightning.
</P>
<P>
   At 3:45 p.m., Bill Livingood, the House sergeant-at-arms, who
oversees security on the House side of the Capitol, got a phone
call from the office of the independent counsel telling him that
the report would be arriving in about 15 minutes. In short order,
two vans pulled up to the House side of the Capitol, where
television cameras and news photographers were waiting.
</P>
<P>
   As word spread, reporters gathered, aides and members of
Congress spilled out onto the Capitol steps and tourists gaped
slack-jawed at the bit of history suddenly unfolding before their
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   One of those who seemed surprised was House Speaker Newt
Gingrich. Gingrich was standing outside the Library of Congress,
across the grounds from the Capitol, talking to reporters about the
Republicans' legislative agenda. When reporters swarmed around
asking if the report had arrived, Gingrich gazed toward the crowd
around the vans and said, ``I can't confirm that.''
</P>
<P>
   Another one seemingly in the dark was David Schippers, chief
counsel to the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee, which would
initiate any impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Schippers was watching television when a bulletin announced that
the report had arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, really?'' he mused to himself, then cast an eye out his
window. ``Look out your window, there it is!'' he recalled
thinking. He said that the sheer number of boxes _ 36 _ made him
think he would be working all year. ``I saw Christmas going down
the toilet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Livingood, 61, a retired Secret Service agent who was appointed
sergeant-at-arms in January 1995 by the speaker, inventoried the
boxes as they were officially transmitted to the House _ which
means they were unloaded from vans from the independent counsel's
office and reloaded into Capitol Hill Chevy Suburbans.
</P>
<P>
   From the Capitol, the Suburbans whisked the boxes to the Gerald
R. Ford House office building, a drab, six-story federal building
less than a half-mile from the Capitol. The boxes were stashed in a
room on the first floor of the building and placed under 24-hour
armed guard by Capitol Hill police.
</P>
<P>
   Police had changed the locks on the room Tuesday night, not
knowing exactly when the documents would arrive but knowing that as
long as the House had not decided how to handle them, they would
need to be kept secure. The House is to vote Friday on what to do
with the materials.
</P>
<P>
   After the boxes left the Capitol, Charles Bakaly, a spokesman
for Starr, told reporters standing outside the Capitol:
``Responsibility for the information that we have transmitted today
and for any further action now lies with the Congress as provided
for by the Constitution.''

 &HT;    Magazine covers make the point: Stock markets can go down, too
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're having a good day, don't walk by a magazine stand. The
depressing covers of most business and general interest magazines
will probably spoil it.
</P>
<P>
   In one of those rare but not unprecedented moves, the editors of
just about all the prominent news publications chose last week's
stock market mini-crash for their cover stories.
</P>
<P>
   The message is pretty much the same: Markets go down as well as
up, especially in a world beset by crises in Asia, Russia, Latin
America and the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they say, this confluence of events probably signals the
arrival of a new, slower, more nervous period of time for investors
and consumers. But it's not the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes (Sept. 21) takes the honors for the most
attention-grabbing cover, with its stark black-and-white format and
the headline that asks: ``Is it Armageddon ... or October 1987
revisited?'' The latter, of course, refers to the worst crash in
stock market history. Forbes' answer, in so many words, is an
unequivocal neither.
</P>
<P>
   Next in fright value is Fortune (Sept. 28), whose cover calls it
``The crash of '98'' and asks: ``Can the U.S. economy hold up?''
The volatile Dow Jones industrial average is just one symptom of
world problems, the magazine says. ``The real danger: A troubled
world may finally halt America's miracle expansion.''
</P>
<P>
   Barron's (Sept. 7) lists 50 stocks an investor should look at to
survive the downturn.
</P>
<P>
   Time (Sept. 14), whose cover depicts investors tumbling from the
end of a stock market chart, asks simply, ``Is the boom over?''
Rival Newsweek (Sept. 14) alone chooses to put home run hitters
Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa on its cover, while looking at the
``meltdown in the markets'' inside. U.S. News &AMP; World Report (Sept.
14) also asks the question all small investors most want answered:
``Buy, sell, sit tight?''
</P>
<P>
   Two magazines take a broader look at the global economy as a
backdrop to the markets: Business Week (Sept. 14) and The Economist
(Sept. 5-11). Their message is that the post-Cold War world has
gotten a little more dangerous economically, but with cool heads
and sensible planning, there's nothing that can't be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Several magazines chose different approaches to the market.
P.O.V. (September), a relatively new magazine for entrepreneurs,
follows a New York Stock Exchange floor trader hour by hour through
his workday. It answers a lot of questions about how things get
done.
</P>
<P>
   Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine (October) looks at the
burgeoning phenomenon of online investing with a cover story that
says: ``Goodbye, Wall Street. Hello, Omaha. How online investing is
shifting the balance of power _ to you.''
</P>
<P>
   If all this leaves you a bundle of nerves, take heart. For if
Wall Street guru Ned Davis is correct, this flood of national
magazine coverage means the bear market is on its last legs.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, a respected stock market technician whose research is
widely used on Wall Street, contends contrarian style that bull
(and bear) markets are on the verge of reversing course by the time
they show up on the covers of national magazines _ and can show you
a lot of magazine covers to prove it.

 &HT;    Delta to alter international flight seating
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines, following the lead of some of its rivals, will
scrap separate first- and business-class sections on international
flights in favor of a single premium-service section.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Delta said Wednesday it will begin installing new
combined premium-class sections this winter on planes flying
trans-Atlantic, trans-Pacific and Brazil routes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new product will be the industry-leading business class
and better in many ways than Delta's current first class,'' the
airline said.
</P>
<P>
   The new sections, which don't yet have a marketing name, feature
improved seats, food and in-flight entertainment systems, Delta
said. The airline plans to spend more than $125 million to refit
its 57 planes that fly internationally _ about $2.2 million per
plane.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes only 15 months after Delta rolled out its
Enhanced Business Class service and touted it in a new ad campaign.
That upgrade was widely viewed as too little, too late to reverse a
decline in Delta's service image among international business
fliers in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's give them credit for admitting a mistake and learning
from it,'' said Joe Brancatelli, a columnist for biztravel.com.
``This is good news for Delta travelers, assuming the new product
is all it's cracked up to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Other carriers that already have single premium sections include
Continental Airlines, whose BusinessFirst service is considered a
key element in the carrier's image turnaround in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The sections typically offer service and comfort better than
business class but not as lavish as first class. Carriers hope they
will attract more business fliers, many of whom have corporate
approval to fly in business class but not first class. Delta said
seats in its new sections will be priced at or near current
business-class levels.
</P>
<P>
   A one-way Atlanta-London business-class ticket now costs $2,795,
while a first-class ticket costs $3,977. Many passengers use
frequent flier points to upgrade, however.
</P>
<P>
   Delta spokeswoman Katie Moussouri said demand for business-class
seats on international flights is seven times higher than for first
class and is growing faster.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some carriers remain wedded to the traditional
configuration, in part so they can offer an ultra-luxury upgrade
perk to their most loyal frequent fliers.
</P>
<P>
   Delta said the refitting of planes will take several months, and
not all elements of the new service will be evident until next
summer.

 &HT;    Market's rally stalls on fears about earnings
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investors failed to sustain the stock market's record-setting
rally on Wednesday after several blue chip companies issued
disappointing third-quarter profit warnings _ the first of many,
analysts fear.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation of President Clinton added to the market's
pessimism, which intensified in the final hour when special
prosecutor Kenneth Starr sent the report of his investigation to
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Investors had hoped the market could sustain Tuesday's
spectacular rally, when buying pushed three stock market averages
to record-breaking one-day point gains _ including a 381-point
surge by the Dow Jones industrial average.
</P>
<P>
   But brokerage giant Merrill Lynch said its exposure to
deteriorating foreign markets had hurt its profitability in the
first two months of this quarter. Its shares fell $6.75 to $59.25.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble fell $7.75 to $71.87 1/2 after scaling back its
forecast of third-quarter profit growth.
</P>
<P>
   And retail stocks were hurt by analysts' warnings that slower
economic growth would hurt Christmas sales. Sears, Roebuck shares,
downgraded by one analyst, fell $4.12 1/2 to $46.37 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of the day's bad news sent stock prices lower across
a broad front. The Dow fell just under 2 percent, reversing its 5
percent gain on Tuesday, and the Nasdaq composite index dropped 2.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Pre-announcements of third-quarter earnings have been cited by
some analysts as a potential indicator of market trends.
</P>
<P>
   A large number of earnings disappointments _ especially by big
companies _ would be regarded as a sign overall profit growth would
be weak, hurting stocks generally.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's warnings brought profit growth back into focus, at
least enough to offset the benefit of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan's suggestion last week of a cut in interest rates. That's
what sent stocks soaring on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, many analysts think the market will retest the
lows it reached Aug. 31 at the end of the initial bearish sell-off.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the market's future would be determined by the
profit outlook, in this view: a trading range, or additional losses
until the selling finally bottoms out.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson-Humphrey strategist Robert S. Robbins said investor
concern over foreign economic problems could send stocks lower, but
the market is beginning to look like ``an increasingly attractive
buying opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The best estimate for the Dow's year-end close remains 9,455,
Robbins said. That would be a gain of 20 percent from Wednesday's
close.

 &HT;    Millennium buys Buckhead property
 &HT;    By Sallye Salter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Millennium Partners, a New York-based firm speedily rolling out
$2 billion in entertainment-focused multi-use development in major
U.S. cities, has taken a stake in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The firm has purchased an interest in a Buckhead property owned
by Pope &AMP; Land Enterprises at the corner of Peachtree and
Peachtree-Dunwoody roads. The 4-acre site is zoned for development
of 1 million square feet of high-rise office, hotel and residential
space. Pope &AMP; Land executive Larry Kelly said last month a deal was
pending.
</P>
<P>
   Millennium is ``evaluating the opportunities'' for a mixed-use
project and expects to complete a plan by year-end, according to
Millennium spokesman Norbert Beatty.
</P>
<P>
   Millennium is noted for mega-developments that typically include
brand-name operations such as Sony multi-screen theaters, Reebok
recreational and fitness centers and Four Seasons or Ritz-Carlton
hotels and condominiums.
</P>
<P>
   The firm is the developer of the $500 million Lincoln Square in
New York that bolstered the Lincoln Center area. It is taking that
concept into Boston, where it has proposed three projects; into San
Francisco, where it is building a Four Seasons project; and into
Miami, where it plans an 86-story Millennium Tower.
</P>
<P>
   In late July, Millennium doubled its capital base with an influx
of $327 million from its financiers _ Goldman Sachs' Whitehall
Fund, George Soros' Quantum Realty Fund, Citicorp Real Estate and a
consortium of German financial institutions.

 &HT;    Cost of Alzheimer's mounts for companies
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alzheimer's disease costs American businesses more than $33
billion a year in lost worker productivity and absenteeism,
according to a study released Wednesday by the Alzheimer's
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The group wants Congress to earmark $100 million more to
Alzheimer research. The government currently spends $349 million
researching the disease. The study was sent to each of the Fortune
500 companies and all members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The financial toll of Alzheimer's is expected to grow
dramatically in the early part of the next century as baby boomers
_ the nation's largest group of workers and chief caregivers _ get
older. Baby boomers are the first generation of American workers
forced to deal with the dual dilemma of child care and elder care,
thus earning the nickname, ``The Sandwich Generation.''
</P>
<P>
   The study is the first to quantify the disease's financial
impact on American business. The Alzheimer's Association is a
national nonprofit group that raises money for research and
programs about the disease.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 4 million Americans have Alzheimer's, which causes
steady decline in memory and other major cognitive impairments,
eventually rendering people unable to care for themselves. Many
often need round-the-clock care. Another 400,000 are diagnosed with
the disease each year. Former President Ronald Reagan raised
awareness of Alzheimer's several years ago when he revealed he had
the disease.
</P>
<P>
   In metro Atlanta, about 52,000 people have Alzheimer's,
according to the Atlanta chapter of the Alzheimer's Association.
Another 120,000 people _ mostly family members _ are caring for
those with the disease, said Jan Bequeath, executive director of
the Atlanta area chapter. In 10 years, nearly one in three
Georgians will be 65 or older _ the high-risk age group for
Alzheimer's, Bequeath said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, there were 34 million Americans over age 65. The
problem of elder care for all types of illnesses is expected to get
so big Business Insurance magazine recently suggested four in 10
workers in 2005 will be more concerned with caring for a parent
than a child.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's study provided hard data for a problem that has
mostly been addressed with anecdotal evidence. It also helps dispel
a widely held belief the disease holds no consequences for
corporate America because it is a disease that affects a group of
people who no longer are employed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost of Alzheimer's is a lot bigger than we thought it was
and that cost is mostly borne by business,'' said Ross Koppel, a
University of Pennsylvania professor of research methodology who
co-authored the study. Koppel also heads the Social Research
Corporation in Wyncote, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly $26 billion in the disease's costs are tied to worker
absenteeism and lost productivity. Another $3.59 billion is spent
replacing those workers and $1.32 billion is spent on continuing
health care coverage for workers on leave, fees to temporary
agencies and increased use of Employee Assistance Programs.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found, on average, a full-time worker caring for
a person with Alzheimer's loses more than three weeks _ 23.82 days
_ of work a year due to absenteeism or other interruptions.
</P>
<P>
   Between one-tenth and one-fifth quit work entirely.
</P>
<P>
   How business handles such dependent care issues will be a big
challenge in the future as the elderly become a larger part of the
U.S. population and the strain of caring for them taxes the
nation's health care system and caregivers' emotional well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Alzheimer's has drained Lillian Smith of Marietta, emotionally
and financially. The seamstress has been caring for her 86-year-old
mother who has Alzheimer's since 1992. It's kept Smith from taking
on more work and cost her anywhere from $8 to $15 an hour for a
sitter just so she can go to the grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could write a book. It's a traumatic thing,'' Smith said.
``It's cost me about six years of income. I'm just a wreck right
now. You're very limited in what you can do.''

 &HT;    Woodruff Foundation gives CAP $2 million
 &HT;    By Maria Saporta
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Robert W. Woodruff Foundation has validated Central Atlanta
Progress' efforts to revitalize the downtown area by giving its
nonprofit arm, Capacity Inc., a $2 million donation over three
years.
</P>
<P>
   The gift, Woodruff's largest ever to CAP, will permit the
organization, whose membership is composed of key Atlanta
executives, to be more pro-active in several areas _ strategic
planning, development, marketing and social services.
</P>
<P>
   ``This commitment obviously expresses our trustees' confidence
in CAP leadership and the imperative to continue to improve
downtown in meaningful ways,'' said C.H. ``Pete'' McTier, president
of the Woodruff Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   CAP President Charlie Battle said the Woodruff gift includes a
$1.5 million challenge, so the organization will need to raise $1.5
million from donors over the next two years to fulfill its
ambitious agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this shows strong support for CAP and Charlie,'' said
F. Duane Ackerman, CEO of BellSouth Corp. and chairman of the
downtown organization. ``This kind of gift ensures our ability to
keep downtown moving forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Only two years ago, the business community was considering plans
to fold CAP into the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Downtown is important,'' Battle said Wednesday morning after
telling his executive committee members about the gift. ``It is
important that we have an organization that's focused on the
particular issues.''
</P>
<P>
   If CAP is able to meet the Woodruff challenge, it will have $3.5
million to invest.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, CAP plans to embark on a new strategic plan for
downtown. Battle wants an action plan similar to the successful
BluePrint Midtown effort.
</P>
<P>
   The donation also will permit CAP and its sister group COPA
(Centennial Olympic Park Area Inc.) to become more of a catalyst
for economic development downtown, address the homeless issue and
support the Community Court, a legal forum for the resolution of
small disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, CAP wants to play a bigger role in marketing downtown
Atlanta to get more people to live, work and play there.
</P>
<P>
   CAP will now have a war chest to go along with its ``war room,''
the name it gave its board room because it symbolizes the group's
ability to garner forces to help downtown.

   WASHINGTON _ The Senate on Wednesday resurrected a bill to
overhaul the nation's campaign finance laws, seven months after
tossing it into the legislative dust bin.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate had all but buried the bill for the year in a series
of procedural votes last February. But following the House's
resounding approval of a similar measure last month, Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi was forced to bring the
measure back up again this week.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the surprisingly strong showing in the House, the
measure still faces overwhelming odds in the Senate. A majority of
senators back the measure, but supporters are still eight votes
short of the 60 needed to end a Republican filibuster and force a
vote on the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is scheduled to vote again on Thursday to cut off
debate, but there was no sign Wednesday that the measure had added
any converts over the past several months.
</P>
<P>
   ``This does not reveal any sense of momentum behind a plan
that's constitutionally flawed,'' said Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.,
the leading Senate critic of the campaign finance overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   But the bill's dim prospects did not stop supporters, and some
opponents, from parading to the Senate floor to laud or condemn the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the Senate's opportunity to do not only what's right,
but what's necessary,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who is a
main author of the bill along with Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wisc.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain-Feingold bill would ban unlimited, unregulated
donations to political parties. It was this so-called soft money
that led to the campaign-financing abuses in the 1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would also curb the increasingly popular
practice of independent groups' running advertisements praising or
attacking candidates. The bill would tightly regulate such ads that
identify candidates within 60 days of an election.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Feingold had hoped that at least two new developments
since February might reap new support.
</P>
<P>
   With only two months before congressional elections, there was a
thread of hope that some Senate Republicans might turn after the
House last month approved, by a 252-179 vote, a measure sponsored
by Reps. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., and Martin Meehan, D-Mass.
Sixty-one Republicans split from their party to back that bill,
which prevailed despite months of debate and numerous hurdles
erected by the House Republican leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, Attorney General Janet Reno ordered a 90-day
inquiry into whether President Clinton circumvented federal
election laws in 1996. There are now three 90-day inquiries pending
that could lead to the appointment of an independent counsel to
investigate Clinton, Vice President Al Gore or their top aides, for
possible campaign finance abuses in the 1996 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, congressional aides say, one reason Lott so willingly
agreed to bring up the campaign finance bill this week was that he
did not want the issue to divide Senate Republicans and take the
focus off Clinton's problems.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Feingold are now trying to attach their measure as an
amendment to a spending bill for the Interior Department.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the campaign finance overhaul, who outnumbered
those critics who gave floor speeches, said the measure would
prevent big campaign donors from corrupting the political system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now there's only one question to a young man or young women
interested in political office: Where's the money?'' said McCain.
``If they don't have the money, it doesn't matter what their
principles are, they don't have much of a chance in public
office.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People do not trust us today,'' McCain continued. ``Give our
constituents a reason again to trust us.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Feingold said, ``We're as close as we've ever come to passing
that bill and cleaning up a corrupt system.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., said, ``The system in place today
forces candidates to search not for votes, but for money. Our
current system has spiraled completely out of control. It's no
longer a system of rules, but a system of loopholes.''
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of the bill said it violated constitutional
guarantees of free speech and would be rejected by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill marginalizes the effects of political party
organizations, and does so to the extent it increases the influence
of nonparty organizations of the most narrow special interests,''
said Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   What happens after Thursday and, as most aides and senators
expect, supporters fail to break the filibuster, is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   While some Democrats are eager to bring the Senate to a
standstill until an up-or-down vote is allowed, other Democrats and
Republican supporters seem willing to use this year's votes as a
strong foundation from which to renew the fight next year.

 &HT;    36 Pandora's boxes bedevil the president
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This week, God is in the numbers and the devil is in the
details, in a major way.
</P>
<P>
   Having marveled at Mark McGwire's 62nd homer and gasped at the
Dow's record rebound Tuesday, the nation witnessed a third historic
moment Wednesday with the delivery of independent counsel Kenneth
Starr's report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Young writers are admonished never to use the old best-of-times,
worst-of-times cliche, but if this is not the week to dust it off,
when will be?
</P>
<P>
   The spectacle of box after box of evidence, 36 in all, being
delivered to the sergeant at arms, in combination with the way
congressional Democrats have been talking before their Wednesday
morning meeting with Clinton, add to the impression that this long
and agonized affair could be headed for a speedy conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   But while this ``crisis of the regime,'' as New York Democrat
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan called it, has reached a new stage of
gravity, little about it promises to be neat or quick.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic congressional leaders who met with Clinton
described him as saddened and contrite, and wishful thinking by
some might have misconstrued this as evidence he's beginning to
listen to the calls that he resign before they grow too loud.
</P>
<P>
   The same could not be said of the Clinton who later in the day
used an Orlando fund-raiser as the forum for another apology _ not
the last, if he takes the advice he was given by his fellow
Democrats on Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   This seemed a Clinton at least more contrite than he was three
weeks ago, but in no mood at all to quit. Which leads to a grand
dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of the report during the first week of the fall
political campaign seems to have given Clinton his cue for the
defense he will mount in coming weeks, as the devilish details leak
from those brown boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is best out on the stump, and where there is a
Democratic candidate willing to share one with him, he'll likely be
there. He may be his party's greatest liability at the moment, but
he is still its most talented campaigner.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is a great dilemma for Republicans also, though they
don't have to turn down his speaking offers.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich's first duty after the delivery
Wednesday afternoon was to secure the report in a vault until the
House can pass a resolution about what to do with it _ the first,
actually, of many resolutions about what to do with it. It is the
beginning of the most difficult challenge he has faced as speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich has said that he believes a broader pattern of crimes
than simply lying about an affair with Lewinsky would be necessary
for Congress to impeach the president. The boxes are said to
contain a broader case against Clinton, but may still be tied
closely enough to the sexual revelations to pose a problem over how
to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   So, Democrats who think the president's behavior too
reprehensible to defend and Republicans who believe his offenses
too personal to impeach will decide, as a fall election approaches,
what is right for the country. The betting here is that Sammy Sosa
will reach the 62 mark long before that dilemma is resolved.

LONDON REVS UP FOR THE FALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., Sept. 13)  
(JT) 
 By BENEDICT NIGHTINGALE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Thank goodness the fall is now upon us, for I seem to
have spent the summer on the phone, frustrating and upsetting the
customary influx of theaterphiliacs from America. Again and again
the conversation has gone something like this.
</P>
<P>
   Caller: ``I can't wait to see Tom Stoppard's `Invention of
Love'.'' Me: ``Sorry, it's not on any more.'' Caller: Oh well, I
hear `The Weir' is terrific.'' Me: ``Afraid I've got bad news there
too.'' Caller: ``So it looks as if I'll have to rely on the Royal
Shakespeare Company.'' Me: ``No, they're out of town for the
duration.''
</P>
<P>
   But now there should be a lift both in my voice and in the
visitors' spirits. The RSC will be back at its London home, the
Barbican, from October onward. Both ``The Invention of Love'' and
``The Weir'' are due in the West End.
</P>
<P>
   And there are major performances in the offing, especially from
British actresses. Diana Rigg, who earned a Tony as Euripides'
baleful Medea, has just opened as Racine's lovelorn Phedre at the
Albery; and soon she will be joined on the London stage by Judi
Dench as the title character in Eduardo de Filippo's ``Filumena''
and Helen Mirren as a Cleopatra feistily in love with Alan
Rickman's Antony.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Weir'' is almost as much phenomenon as play. It opened
last year in the Royal Court's 60-seat studio, and, to be frank,
nobody expected a great deal of it.
</P>
<P>
   Its author, Conor McPherson, was a 25-year-old Irishman who had
scored a modest success on the London fringe with two plays (``St.
Nicholas,'' ``This Lime Tree Bower'') that consisted entirely of
monologues. Was he capable of writing a drama _ meaning a piece
that had absorbed the lesson taught by Aeschylus 2,500 years ago,
and allowed characters to bump into each other _ rather than a
series of lonely speeches?
</P>
<P>
   Indeed he could, though at first the signs seemed unpromising. A
few men, gathered in a tacky pub in the Irish outback, were
chattering of this and that when in came a young woman from Dublin
accompanied by her boastful real estate agent.
</P>
<P>
   If the setting were any other European country, or maybe
America, the conversation would have continued in a more or less
conventional style. But Ireland is still the country for tall
tales, and soon the drinkers were regaling the village's new
resident with spooky stories about fairy roads, ghostly criminals,
and so on. What, yet more monologues?
</P>
<P>
   But there was a difference. These monologues were interactive.
Ian Rickson's superb cast was competing for a pretty woman's
attention and inadvertently revealing much about themselves. In
McPherson's hands, tales express macho swagger, insecurity, fear,
failure, loss, metaphysical mystery and, when the young Dubliner
makes her own quiet contribution, a sense of desolation and loss
that reduces everyone to awed silence.
</P>
<P>
   By the end you should feel the richness and intensity of the
situation and understand why so seemingly simple a piece
transferred to the West End is being revived at the Duke of York's
on Oct. 12 and is certain soon to go to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody could accuse ``The Invention of Love'' of being seemingly
simple, or anything but pretty complex. Who but Stoppard would have
the imaginative chutzpah to open with Charon, looking and sounding
like a morose London cab driver, punting the poet A.E. Housman down
the River Styx into Hades? Who else would go on to give us a memory
play that leaps to and fro through time, in the process presenting
us with figures as various as Oscar Wilde and John Ruskin and
subjects that range from classical scholarship to Victorian
attitudes to homosexuality?
</P>
<P>
   It's mentally challenging stuff, but, like Stoppard's recent
``Arcadia,'' touching, too. The key point about Housman, the author
of ``A Shropshire Lad,'' is that at Oxford he fell in love with a
fellow undergraduate called Moses Jackson, and spent the rest of a
longish life earnestly sublimating this unreciprocated passion by
editing obscure Latin texts and penning the odd poem of his own.
</P>
<P>
   John Wood, who created the role of the mature Housman at the
Royal National Theater and will recreate it when the play reopens
at the Haymarket on Nov. 3, makes you feel the man's frustration
and pain as well as his cleverness and wit.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal National Theater itself is going through a strongish
phase under its recently appointed director, Trevor Nunn. Indeed,
Nunn is doing well under Nunn, as he proved with a wonderfully
fresh production of ``Oklahoma!'' that ends on Oct. 3, and is
likely to confirm when he revives Harold Pinter's super-subtle tale
of sexual politics, ``Betrayal,'' on Nov. 24.
</P>
<P>
   But the most beguiling offering at the National this fall is an
``Antony and Cleopatra,'' opening on Oct. 20, that will give Helen
Mirren a chance to re-establish herself as a major classical
actress.
</P>
<P>
   The world knows her best these days as Detective Jane Tennison,
the buttoned-up protagonist of television's ``Prime Suspect''; but
she has many a fine stage performance behind her, most recently in
Turgenev's ``Month in the Country'' as a landowner's wife fallen
passionately, embarrassingly, angrily, self-mockingly, touchingly,
hopefully, preposterously, despairingly in love with a man much
younger than herself.
</P>
<P>
   The RSC, busy in Stratford-on-Avon and on tour since April,
resumes its rivalry with the National on Oct. 29. The opening
production of its new Barbican season will actually be Sheridan's
``School for Scandal,'' with the fast-rising Emma Fielding as the
mischievous Lady Teazle; but revivals of plays by its house
dramatist, given their premieres in Stratford earlier this year,
will be transferring south too, prime among them a finely imagined
``Tempest.''
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Noble's production, which begins its London previews on
Dec. 17, has an especially strong Prospero in David Calder, one of
those unsung actors who have risen through the RSC's ranks,
acquiring superlative skills in the process.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But welcome back to London though it is, the RSC isn't quite the
pre-eminent company it used to be. Aside from the National, there's
the Peter Hall Company, there's the Donmar Warehouse in Covent
Garden, there's the Almeida in Islington. All have a following to
envy, and all have important offerings this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Hall _ the director who created the RSC in 1960 and ran
the National for much of the 1970s and 1980s _ isn't content with
bringing Dame Judi Dench to the Piccadilly on Oct. 8 as one of de
Filippo's formidable Neapolitan women. He's also staging the first
major revival of Peter Shaffer's ``Amadeus'' at the Old Vic on Oct.
21, this time with David Suchet as Salieri, the envious composer
who hounds Mozart to his death.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Britain's latest theatrical knight, David Hare, opens
his adaptation of Schnitzler's wry sex comedy ``La Ronde,''
starring Nicole Kidman, at the Donmar on Sept. 22, abstrusely
retitling it ``The Blue Room.'' That will run through October, and
will be followed in early November by one of the intimately staged
Stephen Sondheim musicals for which the tiny playhouse has become
renowned. It has established ``Assassins,'' a failure in New York,
as a major work. It recently presented a fine ``Company.'' We are
all waiting for Nov. 16 to see if ``Into the Woods,'' only a
moderate success when it first appeared on Broadway and in the West
End, will respond to the Donmar treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But even the Donmar looks likely to be upstaged this fall by the
Almeida. Who would have thought that a small, shabby theater in a
downscale section of Islington could be so ambitious and
productive? Earlier this year it brought Juliette Binoche, Liam
Neeson and Kevin Spacey to London. In the last couple of weeks it
has opened Edward Albee's brand-new ``Play About the Baby'' at its
Islington headquarters as well as Ted Hughes' new version of Phedre
at the Albery in the West End.
</P>
<P>
   And still to come is a robust version of Brecht's ``Mr. Puntila
and His Man Matti,'' which I caught and enjoyed when it passed
through this year's Edinburgh Festival, and, at the Albery on Nov.
4, yet another of Racine's poetic dramas.
</P>
<P>
   This time the play on offer is ``Britannicus,'' with Diana Rigg
as the Empress Agrippina and Toby Stephens _ who also plays
Hippolytus to her sexually voracious Phedre _ as her dangerous son,
the future Emperor Nero. Normally one would say that a little-known
neoclassical tragedy about love and death in ancient Rome would not
draw crowds to the hedonistic center of London. But with a cast
like that, can it fail?

   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ Beside the rough ocean that defines Nova
Scotia, near a kilted piper whose lament pierced the breeze, the
victims of Swissair 111 were remembered Wednesday by their families
and the people who adopted the loss as their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have made us feel so loved, so cared for,'' said Clare
Mortimer of California, whose father and stepmother perished in the
Sept. 2 crash.
</P>
<P>
   Mortimer and other relatives of the 229 people who died in the
crash were joined by hundreds of rescue workers and villagers for a
memorial service in the town of Indian Harbour.
</P>
<P>
   Children sang hymns, prayers were offered, and tears feel freely
among a community of mourners and supporters seeking closure to a
week of unbelieving pain and exhausting labor.
</P>
<P>
   The service was attended by Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien, Swiss President Flavio Cotti, US Transportation Secretary
Rodney Slater, Federal Aviation Administration chairman Jane
Garvey, and the chairmen of the Canadian and US transportation
safety boards.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial ended with the mournful sounds of ``Dark Island,''
a Scottish bagpiper's lament about one's yearning to return home.
And a wreath was dropped from a Canadian military helicopter on the
waters near the crash scene. There, helmet-wearing divers returned
to the debris field where the cockpit voice recorder is believed be
lying 190 feet below the surface. The tape is expected to provide
critical clues about the source of smoke in the cockpit, and how
the pilots responded to the escalating emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Concrete mooring platforms were placed on the ocean floor to
secure a Canadian vessel as a diving platform. In this way, a
continuous supply of surface air can be supplied to the divers, who
then will be able to work longer on the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Lieutenant Commander Louis Garneau of the Canadian navy said
that divers would not retrieve any human remains Wednesday,
although many bodies are believed to be pinned on the bottom by
large, nearby pieces of the aircraft's fuselage.
</P>
<P>
   Garneau said that salvage ships, with assistance from the USS
Grapple, probably will not attempt to lift fuselage wreckage for
two or three days.
</P>
<P>
   On the shore, Canadian army troops shifted the focus of their
shore patrols closer to Peggys Cove, about 5 miles from the crash
site. Captain Dan MacIsaac said that soldiers had filled two large
bags with plane wreckage and human remains Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, Swissair rebutted the theory that the wiring
insulation used on the MD-11 had put the aircraft at particular
risk. The aromatic polyimide tape insulation, known by the trade
name Kapton, has been banned by the US Defense Department on
fighter planes.
</P>
<P>
   However, Swissair spokesman Hans Klaus said from Zurich that the
tape is used to protect wiring ``in all commercial planes except
the Boeing 777 ... It is very common in the airline industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, which now owns the McDonnell-Douglas operation that
delivered the MD-11 to Swissair, confirmed this week that all
general-purpose wiring on the plane was insulated by Kapton.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Swissair crew reported smoke in the cockpit and
because an electrical malfunction cut off power to the flight-data
recorder for the last six minutes of the flight, the plane's wiring
is one area that investigators will scrutinize.
</P>
<P>
   The US Navy began tests of this type of insulation in 1978.
Since 1986, the Navy has prohibited its use in new aircraft
programs. The wiring is said by critics to be vulnerable to the
dramatic changes in temperature and humidity that aircraft
experience during flight. Critics say it deteriorates too quickly,
cracks easily and can be shown to explode under some conditions.
</P>
<P>
   With worn insulation, metal-to-metal contact can result and
electrical arcing is possible. Joachim Maitre, a Boston University
professor of journalism and international relations who has written
extensively on defense technology, said Kapton is so volatile it
explodes like magnesium.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram studied 265 field reports
of electrical problems on Air Force F-16s between 1978 and 1986. In
those reports, the newspaper found at least 45 wire firers or
severe arcing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, the Navy asked Congress for $354 million to rewire its
fighter jets. The request stated that ``numerous wiring harnesses
made of Poly-X wire'' _ a similar kind of aromatic polyimide tape _
``have had abnormal insulation aging, embrittlement and cracking
resulting in wire-to-wire sparks, particular during presence of
water.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress did not approve the request, and the Navy began
rewiring fighter jets with money from its own budget.
</P>
<P>
   Fighter planes, however, are subject to many more rigors than
commercial aircraft. One national aviation official, who asked not
to be identified, said Wednesday that comparing military and
passenger jets would be ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
   John Hansman, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor
of aeronautics who is director of the International Conference for
Air Transportation, stressed Wednesday that focusing on Kapton now
is premature.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know for sure it was an electrical fire,'' Hansman
said. ``We do know there was smoke and electrical interruption, but
there are other fire and smoke sources that are still being
investigated.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapton, he said, is a relatively common insulator. ``To my
knowledge, there's not a lot of people in the safety community
saying we need to get Kapton off airplanes,'' Hansman said.

   CORAL GABLES, Fla. _ President Clinton pleaded for forgiveness
and another chance Wednesday from his party's leaders and its rank
and file, rallying support even as prosecutors were preparing to
give Congress the boxed results of their eight-month inquiry into
his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The president apologized to House Democrats at a private White
House meeting Wednesday morning and then, sadly and haltingly, to
Democratic donors in a dimly lit Marriott hotel ballroom in Orlando
on Wednesday afternoon. After the representatives urged him to be
more forthright about his mistakes, Clinton told the donors that he
had done his best to be their friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I also let you down,'' he continued in husky tones to his
transfixed audience. ``And I let my family down and I let this
country down. But I'm trying to make it right. And I'm determined
never to let anything like that happen again.'' His expression
somber, Clinton raised his hands to hush the audience as it broke
into applause, then added that he was determined to ``redeem the
trust'' of longtime supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Clinton made his remarks, just before 3 p.m.,
prosecutors dispatched their report to the Congress. The
president's aides said he had not known that the report would be
delivered Wednesday, although press reports indicate he had
expected it soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no one to blame but myself for my self-inflicted
wounds,'' Clinton said, describing these days as the toughest of
his life but perhaps the most valuable as well.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a supportive introduction and warm ovations that
gave the fund-raiser the feel of a support group, the president
made the kind of bid for political redemption that he has told at
least one friend he should have made three weeks ago, when he first
acknowledged an intimate relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he apologized, Clinton urged his audience not to let the
Lewinsky matter become an issue in the fall election, despite what
he said were efforts to make it one by ``a whole lot of people, in
Washington especially,'' as well as by people ``who write about
this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be fooled, not for a minute, not for a day,'' he said.
``Elections are about you and your children and your communities
and your future.'' He went on to recall his record and to present
his agenda for education, health care, Social Security and other
issues.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At an hour-long meeting Wednesday morning over coffee and danish
in the Yellow Room of the White House residence, the president made
what participants called an emotional apology to the House
Democratic leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows he has done something that has been very, very
difficult not only for his family but for the country,'' said Rep.
David Bonior, D-Mich., the minority whip. ``The president did not
cry, but you could tell by the way he was breathing, you could tell
by his demeanor, that he felt the pain, and he felt it very
strongly.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonior said the group did not discuss the possibility of
resignation or impeachment, and that it forgave Clinton for his
behavior. But he said he told Clinton that he would have to express
sorrow and contrition to the American people forcefully and
repeatedly for weeks and maybe months.
</P>
<P>
   The president flew here this evening from Orlando to raise
$700,000 over dinner for the Florida Democratic party. The
president's advisers had said that they expected a further public
apology from him this week, but they professed surprise that he
chose to make it Wednesday. Clinton was scribbling on a copy of his
speech at his table during the fund-raiser in Orlando, which raised
$300,000 for the Florida Democrats. He informed a senior aide,
Douglas Sosnik, of his intentions only moments before he spoke, a
White House official said.
</P>
<P>
   After taking heat from political allies for a week, Clinton was
among foul-weather friends Wednesday, and he was clearly grateful.
Outside the hotel, about 75 protesters carried signs like ``Resign
You Swine'' and ``Impeach the Ozark Caligula.'' But inside, the
president spoke after Florida Lt. Gov. Buddy MacKay, the Democratic
nominee for governor, praised his leadership. One Democratic
candidate, Maryland Gov. Parris Glendenning, recently canceled a
planned fund-raiser with Clinton over the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay, who is trailing Republican nominee Jeb Bush, called
Clinton a stalwart friend of Florida. ``Martin Luther King once
said, `We will remember not the words of our enemies but the
silence of our friends,' '' MacKay said. ``Mr. President, we are
not going to be silent. We are going to speak out in support of the
work you are doing.'' He was drowned out by applause.
</P>
<P>
   As he took his place behind the lectern to a shout of ``We love
you, Bill!'' Clinton told that audience of about 350 that they had
been ``astonishingly kind and generous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If God lets me live to be an old man, I will never forget what
Buddy MacKay said today from this platform, when he could have said
nothing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton described shaking hands with children at the Hillcrest
elementary school in Orlando this morning, where he promoted his
education agenda. One boy _ ``kind of husky,'' the president said,
as he had been as boy _ told Clinton that he would like to be a
president like him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, I want to be able to conduct my life and my
presidency so that all the parents of the country could feel good
if their children were able to say that again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he hoped this would be a time of ``reconciliation and
healing'' that would help millions of families grow stronger.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was impressed. ``What I heard today is what I've
always heard about Bill Clinton, that he's an effective speaker,''
said Jon Pohl, an architect who called himself an independent but
said he was supporting MacKay. ``But that doesn't change what he's
done.'' Pohl said Clinton ``will never be able to say what I want
him to say. I want him to say that he's stepping down.''
</P>
<P>
   But Carol Foglesong, the recorder of deeds for Orange County,
said she did not need to hear the apology, although other Americans
might. ``It was the right amount,'' she said. ``He said he was
sorry. But the question is, `Where do we go from here?' ''

GRIM MOOD AT THE WHITE HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>

(JT) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the delivery of the independent counsel's
report to Congress on Wednesday afternoon, the struggle for
Clinton's political life reached a critical milepost whose gravity
could be felt throughout the White House.
</P>
<P>
   It could most clearly be seen in the grim face of David Kendall,
the attorney who has accompanied the president through four years
of investigation into the most intimate details of his life. He was
urgently summoned to the White House when word reached the
president's aides that the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, had
delivered to Congress 36 boxes containing the case against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall emerged from the West Wing of the White House late
Wednesday afternoon to deliver a terse, three-sentence statement,
reminding the public that Starr's report to Congress was a
one-sided presentation of a prosecutor's charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is,'' Kendall intoned on an incongruously glorious day
in the capital, ``no basis for impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   But since no one at the White House has seen the Starr report or
any part of it, it was not clear why Kendall was so certain that it
did not contain evidence of impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   This now, is the battleground, and the president's depleted
forces began preparations for what could prove to be Clinton's last
fight.
</P>
<P>
   One presidential adviser said that a sense of foreboding hung
over the White House as Clinton moved from the perilous stage of
investigation and confession toward judgment. He described the last
few weeks as ``a weird interlude,'' after the president's televised
admission and before the delivery of the Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, the president's problems move into a more
concrete, and more threatening, phase. ``We're leaving the world of
rumor and innuendo and Matt Drudge,'' this adviser said. ``Pretty
soon we're going to start dealing with something that is real.''
</P>
<P>
   One young aide was in tears last week as she described the
hellishness of the past seven months for those who believed in
Clinton. She worked night after night, going home in exhaustion and
uncertainty. Her faith was shattered by Clinton's Aug. 17
confession of a relationship with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky and his repeated lies about it.
</P>
<P>
   She is leaving the White House in the next few weeks and does
not expect to work in government again.
</P>
<P>
   Older, more seasoned aides took Wednesday as just another tough
day in an unrelievedly tough year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We show up, do our jobs and keep our eye on the ball,'' said
Mike McCurry, the president's press secretary who is counting the
days until his mid-October departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was the same thing it's been for the past eight
months,'' he said, ``no better, no worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Plans had been underway for weeks to shift responsibility for
managing the president's difficulties from his lawyers to his
political advisers after Starr completed his report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The political team conferred with the president's lawyers to
write Kendall's statement and then met into the evening to begin to
map a strategy to forestall impeachment hearings in the House.
Among those who will shoulder the burden of handling any
impeachment inquiry are John Podesta, the deputy chief of staff,
Rahm Emanuel, senior adviser, Douglas Sosnik, counselor, and
Lawrence Stein, director of congressional affairs. All have long
experience dealing with Democrats on Capitol Hill and around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Until the contents of the report are revealed, however, they
were still grappling with the same shadows that have haunted them
for the past seven months.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a meeting with House Democratic leaders this
morning, expressed his sorrow and remorse and begged for
forgiveness and political succor. Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., said
that Clinton expressed his regrets for his lies and the damage he
has done to the country in a ``very, very emotional way.''
</P>
<P>
   White House aides who attended the meeting said that the
president delivered a heartfelt apology to the lawmakers as a
possible prelude to a broader appeal for absolution from the
American people. That could come in remarks on Friday to a
gathering of religious leaders at a White House prayer breakfast,
aides said.
</P>
<P>
   But as Clinton continues his public penance, White House
staffers are dealing with their grief and anger more privately. For
many, the president's admission three weeks ago of an illicit
affair with Ms. Lewinsky marked an end to their dreams, an end to
their illusions.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the constant round of meetings at the White House
Wednesday, one official said the staff was essentially in suspended
animation, waiting to hear what Starr had on the president and what
the House intended to do about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wait,'' this official said. ``We don't know how to respond
because we don't know what's in it.''

FOLLOWING A DIFFERENT DRUMBEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (for release Sunday, Sept. 13)  
 (bl)  
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most musical visitors to Europe this fall will want to see the
great opera houses and hear the outstanding orchestras _ the Vienna
Philharmonic, the Berlin Philharmonic, the Royal Concertgebouw _ on
home ground. But just as enticing are the opportunities to hear
refreshingly adventurous performances.
</P>
<P>
   A single weekend in London offers examples. On Oct. 23 in the
Festival Hall, Pierre-Laurent Aimard will play the most recent
three of Gyorgy Ligeti's spectacular Piano Etudes, right in the
middle of an orchestral concert of older Hungarian music by Bartok
and Kodaly, performed by the BBC Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   The next night, in the same place, Christoph Eschenbach will
conduct the London Philharmonic in Mahler's Sixth Symphony and a
work by Toru Takemitsu, presented as part of a monthlong Takemitsu
celebration at the Festival Hall and other auditoriums in the South
Bank Center. Then on Oct. 25, the London Symphony will play an
all-Shostakovich program under Mstislav Rostropovich at the city's
other major concert site, the Barbican Center.
</P>
<P>
   The most promising concert in the Takemitsu series will be on
Oct. 28 when Oliver Knussen leads the London Sinfonietta in a
variety of works, including the piano concerto ``Arc'' with Peter
Serkin. On Oct. 30 the BBC presents another of its ``Hungarian
Focus'' concerts at the Festival Hall, this time with Bartok's
opera ``Bluebeard's Castle'' (John Tomlinson as Bluebeard and Peter
Eotvos conducting) and Gyorgy Kurtag's intensely moving ``Songs of
Despair and Sorrow'' for chorus and instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Other big events at the Barbican include a Sept. 27 performance
of Messiaen's colossal, astonishing panoply of sound, ``The
Transfiguration,'' with Messiaen's widow, Yvonne Loriod, playing
the piano, and Kent Nagano conducting the orchestra and choir.
</P>
<P>
   The Barbican is also the place for new American music this fall.
John Zorn and John Adams will give concerts of their work on Oct.
27 and Nov. 1, and Elliott Carter's 90th birthday will be marked by
a grand concert on Nov. 28, with his Fifth Quartet, Piano Quintet
and orchestral ``Symphonia'' on the program. This last work,
lustrous and playful, will again involve those invaluable regulars
of London's musical life, the BBC Symphony and Knussen.
</P>
<P>
   With Covent Garden closed, and the English National Opera's
programming suffering from a lack of funds, opera lovers might
prefer to skip across the channel to Amsterdam. This month the
Netherlands Opera adds ``Goetterdaemmerung'' to its ``Ring'' cycle,
daringly produced by Pierre Audi with the orchestra onstage at the
Het Muziektheater; the cast includes Jeannine Altmeyer as
Bruennhilde, Heinz Kruse as Siegfried and Kurt Rydl as Hagen.
</P>
<P>
   From Oct. 1 to 25 another of Audi's productions, his powerful
version of Monteverdi's ``Return of Ulysses,'' will be revived.
Then from Nov. 4 to 29 Peter Sellars' staging of Stravinsky's
``Rake's Progress,'' with Reinbert de Leeuw conducting, should
sound as vivid as it looks; principal singers are Thomas Randle,
Heidi Grant Murphy and Willard White.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, from Dec. 2 to 26, Semyon Bychkov conducts and Lev
Dodin directs a new production of Tchaikovsky's ``Queen of
Spades.''
</P>
<P>
   In Paris the main operatic event will be the new production at
the Palais Garnier on Nov. 5 to 25 of a skillfully contrived double
bill. Both Alexander von Zemlinsky's ``Dwarf'' and Ravel's ``Child
and the Spectres'' are rapturous, terrifying portrayals of the
heartlessness of children. James Conlon conducts, with directing
and design by Richard Jones and Antony McDonald. David Kuebler is
the Dwarf with Christine Schaefer as the Infanta in the Zemlinsky
opera, and Gaele Le Roi is the Child in the Ravel.
</P>
<P>
   The most interesting concerts in Paris are happening at the Cite
de la Musique, where Pierre Boulez conducts three programs in
October. And a week in early December is devoted to Messiaen, who
would have been 90 on the day the week ends, Dec. 10. The week
includes a Dec. 5 performance by Pierre-Laurent Aimard, who will
play ``Vingt Regards sur l'Enfant Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   In Berlin, the Philharmonic has a series of attractive
invitations. From Sept. 29 to Oct. 1, Claudio Abbado conducts a
French program, including rarities by Berlioz (``Tristia,''
``Herminie'') with Veronique Gens singing. Oct. 30 to Nov. 1,
Daniel Barenboim couples Bruckner's Fourth Symphony with Pierre
Boulez's dazzling ``Notations One to Four.''
</P>
<P>
   And on Nov. 29 Abbado returns for a concert performance of
Wagner's ``Tristan,'' with the soprano Deborah Polaski and the
tenor Ben Heppner. Roger Norrington conducts the Brahms Violin
Concerto and Elgar's First Symphony on Dec. 11, 12 and 13, followed
on Dec. 19 to 21 by Zubin Mehta, whose program includes Brahms'
Second Symphony and Schoenberg's Variations, a score this orchestra
introduced 70 years ago under Wilhelm Fuertwangler.
</P>
<P>
   Mehta also leads the Vienna Philharmonic on Nov. 30, in works by
Beethoven, Hindemith and Brahms, with Barenboim as pianist, at the
Musikverein. In October the same orchestra has two programs, under
Boulez (his own music, with that of Ravel, Berg and Bartok) and
John Eliot Gardiner (Elgar and Richard Strauss), at the
Musikverein.
</P>
<P>
   Also in Vienna, from Oct. 5 to 30, there will be a Vienna at the
Turn of the Century festival exploring music by composers one might
have found in a Viennese cafe a century ago: Brahms and Mahler,
Schoenberg and Richard Strauss, Bruckner and Zemlinsky.
</P>
<P>
   After this the time frame jumps forward to the present, with the
arrival of the annual Wien Modern festival at the Wiener
Konzerthaus. Events begin Oct. 31, when Boulez will conduct the
Ensemble Intercontemporain in his own music and that of Kurtag.
Another date to note is Nov. 17, when De Leeuw will lead the
Schoenberg Ensemble in music by the Russian visionary Galina
Ustvolskaya at the Konzerthaus Mozart Saal.

COMMENTARY: SIMPLE LESSONS IN HUMANITY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ St. Patrick's Cathedral was filled nearly to capacity
for the prayer service that began at 10:30 Wednesday morning. Close
to 2,500 people were there. They came in very quietly. There were
no surging throngs, just ordinary New Yorkers walking in from the
bustle of Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Khallid Muhammad, the professional race-baiter and compulsive
anti-Semite who organized the so-called Million Youth March, should
have been there. He might have learned something. It was an
interfaith service, a serious effort by people of different ethnic,
cultural and religious backgrounds to pray and work together.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal John O'Connor, who led the service, was joined by an
extraordinary array of religious leaders. Rabbi Ronald Sobel of
Temple Emanu-El was there, and Archbishop Spyridon of the Greek
Orthodox Archdiocese of America, and the Rev. Calvin Butts of the
Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, and Imam Pasha of the Malcolm
Shabazz Mosque. Sister Marie Danaher of the Intercommunity Center
for Justice and Peace was there, and Archbishop Mor Kyrillos of the
Syrian Orthodox Church of Antioch.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, there were plenty of different kinds of people there. You
could fry your mind trying to figure out how to denounce and
belittle each of their backgrounds. You'd need a dictionary of
hate, a thesaurus of slurs.
</P>
<P>
   The point of the service was to try and put a spotlight on the
all but forgotten problems of poverty, hunger and homelessness in
New York and across America. The most amazing thing to me was that
a local prayer service with little or no advance publicity pulled
nearly half as many people as Muhammad was able to gather for a
march that was supposed to have been national in scope and that had
the benefit of several weeks of sensational press coverage.
</P>
<P>
   There is a hunger for mature, reflective, constructive
leadership that is being missed by politicians and rabble-rousers
alike.
</P>
<P>
   I asked the Rev. Alistair Drummond, the moderator of the
Presbytery of New York City, why he felt it was important to
participate in an ecumenical gathering. He said: ``I think it's
very important that in matters touching on what it means to be a
human being, and what it means to have human dignity, that we
realize that we have tremendous commonality between our faith
traditions. The teachings of our Jewish and Muslim and Christian
faiths speak with one voice about the obligation to care for the
poor and the vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said, ``There must be a place in the public argument for
the moral dimension.''
</P>
<P>
   The prayer service grew out of a longstanding concern over the
way the city has been treating homeless families. The service was
not political and no politicians were mentioned by name. But
several of the religious leaders have been highly critical of the
way the Giuliani administration has been using an ostensible
crackdown on fraud as a means of denying services to legitimately
homeless families.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1997, in an address on the plight of the homeless,
O'Connor said: ``Do we root out fraud simply by calling all poor
people fraudulent, or by punishing a hundred decent people in an
effort to screen out perhaps a dozen fraudulent people? We have to
be smarter than that as a people, and certainly we have to be
better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday the cardinal spoke about the continuing plague of
poverty among American children, about the enormous number of
families that have a lower standard of living now than a
quarter-century ago, and about the Americans who, despite a booming
economy, go to sleep hungry at night.
</P>
<P>
   He urged his listeners to see others as human beings, not as
abstractions. He said ``the sterile stuff of government reports''
can leave ``many of us unmoved and untouched.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and other politicians should have been
there. They, too, could have benefited from the simple lessons in
humanity that were delivered in the hour and 20-minute service.
</P>
<P>
   After the service, standing on the steps of the cathedral,
Steven Banks of the Legal Aid Society said: ``Political leaders
often try to make poverty and homelessness into an us-and-them
issue. But they're missing the message of gatherings like this.''  &QL;

LONG AND SHORT OF IT, DAVENPORT WINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Why is Long Lindsay Davenport beating up on this
little person half her size?
</P>
<P>
   It's her job. Nothing personal. That's what Goliath, a very big
hitter, said as he hefted his cudgel and went after David.
</P>
<P>
   This would not be kind, to compare pleasant Miss Davenport, the
No. 2 tennis player of the known world, to the celebrated Goliath,
who comes down to us in literature and films as a lumbering,
overconfident sap. He was easy for the upset-minded David.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, any newcomer to tennis, braving Wednesday's
chilling gales and frequent showers to enter Arthur Ashe Stadium,
could think nothing but David and Goliath revisited at the US Open
scene spread before him or her. Here was Long Lindsay, all 6 feet 3
inches of her, waving a gut-strung cudgel at 5-foot Amanda Coetzer
in what appeared to be a deplorable quarterfinal mismatch. How
could this sort of abuse be allowed?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tennis,'' said Davenport, who hung on at the end to
prevent any reenactment of the Old Testament battle, 6-0, 6-4. She
thereby won a position in the final four a second successive year.
</P>
<P>
   She was not apologetic. ``There's no requirements, no height or
weight requirements. I've always thought (Coetzer has) done great _
5 feet, in the Top 10 (currently No. 11). Definitely made the most
of her potential. But I can't help it if I'm a lot taller than her
and I hit the ball harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport, a 22-year-old Californian, the Olympic gold medalist
two years ago, probably smites the ball harder than anybody else in
the female preserve. She could wind up No. 1 Sunday, supplanting
Martina Hingis _ if Hingis loses her semi to Jana Novotna and
Davenport seizes the championship.
</P>
<P>
   Her ability to power balls through the devilish breezes that
lately have made the new arena seem a wind tunnel pulled Davenport
through the hectic closing game that lasted almost as long as the
opening set.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody likes to get bageled in public with 15,000 people looking
over your shoulder. ``It's not a good feeling. It's a huge
challenge to refocus on the next point, not think about the score,
after you lose, 6-love, and get yourself back in the match,'' said
Coetzer, the gritty South African, who seems about as big as an
item on one of Davenport's charm bracelets. ``But you tell yourself
it's just a set. One set. No worse than losing a 7-6 set.
</P>
<P>
   ``You remind yourself that it can be more difficult on the
winner. You win, 6-love, and maybe you let your confidence slip.
Your opponent has nothing to lose and begins going for a few
shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Six games in 18 playing minutes constituted Lindsay's breakfast
bagel, although there were a couple of rain interruptions. Amanda
has swallowed bagels before _ and baked a few big ones of her own:
6-0, 6-0, over Nathalie Tauziat at the 1992 Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much Lindsay's size,'' Coetzer said of the
greatest physical disparity since women began playing tournament
tennis. ``It's the way she hits the ball _ so hard that you don't
have any say in it. She dictates. She's moving better. Her
confidence is higher.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked very hard to get fitter,'' said Davenport. Though
she did some Goliathan lumbering herself a few years ago, she has
cast aside 30 pounds from an imposing frame since 1996 and is down
to a trim 175.
</P>
<P>
   But deep within Coetzer is the spirit of David. I mean,
everybody she faces is bigger than she, and this was her ninth try
against Davenport, her seventh loss.
</P>
<P>
   Amanda held serve with difficulty to start the second set, which
would endure troublesomely for Davenport for almost an hour.
Cheers, some sarcastic, some supportive, echoed throughout Arthur's
Gulch. Lindsay wasn't fazed and bludgeoned her way to 3-1 and 4-2.
Amanda, with her back often literally against the stadium's high
wall, raced, chased, and traced balls that Davenport, with her huge
swats, declared missing or dead.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport hit hard, harder, hardest, and Coetzer ran fast,
faster, and fastest to overtake the out-of-reach yellow spheres as
though she were a lemon-picking piece worker in the groves of
Italy's Amalfi coast.
</P>
<P>
   Their give-and-take was enthralling. ``That was the longest
point of my life,'' said Davenport, recalling a 45-stroke exchange
with which Coetzer canceled a break point, eventually creeping to
3-4. Then she pierced Davenport's serve for the only time to 4-4.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay retaliated, 5-4, and served for her place in the semis.
The mite had just begun to fight. Amanda's last stand was
marvelous. Neither budged as they careened and crashed their way
through five deuces, and Coetzer held off four match points. She
even had a breaker _ ``Oh, if I'd only gotten to 5-5'' _ busted by
Davenport's double-barreled backhand.
</P>
<P>
   Match Point 5 came up, and Coetzer couldn't deal with a mammoth
forehand. She shook hands and didn't _ would never _ say, ``Pick on
somebody your own size.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVE MATTHEWS, singer and guitarist of the Dave Matthews Band:
</P>
<P>
   Herbie Hancock is coming out with another album, on which he's
covering a bunch of Gershwin music. A whole lot of cool artists are
supposed to be on it. I'm excited because Herbie's so awesome, and
knowing the history of Herbie Hancock, and the fact that he played
with Miles and the way he used a lot of synthesizers in an unusual
way, I don't think he'll do something straightforward with
Gershwin.
</P>
<P>
   Soul Coughing has a new album coming out, and I've always liked
them. We played together quite a bit, but I haven't heard anything
from the new album so I'm excited to hear it. They have a mood and
a consistency that makes you want to move, and their lyrics are
biting and humorous without being preachy. They're cynical about
the media and Hollywood without rejecting it. Their songs often
expose things for what they are. There's a real passion in what
they do that I'm attracted to.
</P>
<P>
   Lyle Lovett is coming out with a new album, and I dig him. I
just think he's a great writer, and while he gets thrown in with
country musicians, he's never really struck me as just country.
He's done so many different things, including some things that are
more gospel or whatever. I like good music. I don't care what
category it falls into. I particularly enjoy people who don't fall
into one category. Lyle Lovett is someone who defies categories,
and does it well. His focus is never, ``How do I put out a good
country album?'' His focus is ``How do I put out a good album?''
And then the album takes on its characteristics as it unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   I think Tom Waits is set to put out something new, and I'll be
psyched for that. His production has gotten smaller as technology
has taken over music. He's gone the other direction. His earlier
stuff had more orchestration, and his newer stuff has a sense of
being recorded in a shed, regardless of the fashions of the
technology around the music.
</P>
<P>
   WYCLEF JEAN, singer, rapper and guitarist of the Fugees:
</P>
<P>
   The stuff I'm psyched about this fall is the new album by the
Flip Mode Squad because we've always heard Busta Rhymes talking
about the Squad on all his records, and I heard some snippets from
it. It was just straight-up hip-hop but with a really good vibe.
</P>
<P>
   As we move into the new millennium, I think a fusion of rock and
rap is going to start to come into play. For example, I really find
the Black Eyed Peas are incredible live. I think kids are going to
start picking up instruments and mixing turntables and hip-hop with
a live band. That's the future mode.
</P>
<P>
   JUDY MCGRATH, president of MTV:
</P>
<P>
   I heard a little bit of the Beck record off a cassette, and it
sounded like ``Appalachian Spring'' meets ``The Girl from
Ipanema.'' What I always like about Beck is his deep voice, and his
lyrics. He has an emotional resonance, he's faithful, and always
going in unpredictable directions. He has an honest realism that
you'd expect to hear in Appalachian country music. He goes places I
like but not places I'd expect.
</P>
<P>
   I'm listening to a lot of singer-songwriters and getting
interested in individual points of view and voices. I like Gillian
Welch and Lucinda Williams, which I listen to a lot in the car. My
3{-year-old daughter requests different songs from that record. I'm
also listening to the new record by Lauryn Hill.
</P>
<P>
   I'm also looking forward to the Alanis Morissette record because
I hear that it's even more Alanis than the first one.
</P>
<P>
   I haven't listened to the entire Hole record, but what I've
heard is definitely worth listening to. Like Madonna's ``Ray of
Light,'' there's a sense that Courtney Love really put her heart
into it. I expect we'll be hearing her commentary on life as she
really lived it.
</P>
<P>
   JASON FLOM, president of Lava/Atlantic Records:
</P>
<P>
   The biggest trend is diversity. If you look at the top of the
charts, there's everything from hardcore to rap to country to
swing. I don't know what the next big thing is, but I'm interested
in the diversity. On the other hand, good singers and good songs
never go out of style.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, there's a strong resurgence of harder music, edgy
stuff like Korn and the Beastie Boys' album, which is not a poppy
record, indicating that the blending of hard rock and rap is
hitting a nerve with kids. Right now there's a bigger demand for
that music than there is product, so I think the biggest one of
those artists has yet to emerge. A couple of bands that are on the
upswing include the Deftones and Sevendust, both of whom kids are
going crazy over. It's like a movement.
</P>
<P>
   And on the brand new buzzing level, there's Eminem, who has just
signed to Dr. Dre's label, Aftermath Records.
</P>
<P>
   JOHN MELLENCAMP, singer and songwriter:
</P>
<P>
   I'm looking for Joni Mitchell's new album, ``Taming the Tiger.''
Besides her songs and her music, her attitude has always interested
me. Of all contemporary women who have written music, to me, Joni
is the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   I'm also interested in hearing the new R.E.M. record, ``Up,''
and seeing what happens with them because they've entered my world
now. The alternative era is over, and it will be interesting to see
how they handle being mature artists, rather than being this year's
model. A few years ago R.E.M. were like royalty in the music
business, so now I want to see if they can stay together as a band,
if they can make it to their 20th album. I'm interested to see if
R.E.M. can sustain themselves, because they lost a drummer and
their time is coming down. All the people who are fanatic about
them are all grown up and paying bills.
</P>
<P>
   I'm also curious about the new Jonny Lang record, although I
don't know if I can take a guy that spells his name J-O-N-N-Y
seriously. Where's the ``H''?

REBUKING EX-ARMS INSPECTOR, ALBRIGHT DEFENDS U.S. ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright hit back on
Wednesday at a former U.N. arms inspector and other critics who
have charged that she attempted to scuttle inspections of Iraq's
weapons sites.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to members of the American Legion, Albright again
held out the possibility that the United States would use military
force against Iraq if President Saddam Hussein continued to refuse
to allow additional weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The critics are sincere,'' Albright said. ``We are, after all,
on the same side. But they are sincerely wrong when they blame
America for the world's failure to uncover the full truth about
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright did not mention by name the former arms inspector,
Scott Ritter, an American, who resigned last month and has accused
the Clinton administration of undermining the inspection system.
</P>
<P>
   But her remarks in a speech in New Orleans to a convention of
the veterans' group were clearly a rebuttal to remarks by Ritter,
who testified on Capitol Hill last week that the United States had
scuttled the arms inspections in Iraq through ``interference and
manipulation, usually coming from the highest levels of the
administration's national security team,'' notably Albright.
</P>
<P>
   ``In recent weeks, some in Washington have suggested that the
United States has not done enough to support the U.N. inspectors _
it has even been suggested that we have tried to prevent UNSCOM
from doing its job,'' Albright said, using the acronym for the
United Nations Special Commission charged with finding and
destroying Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, the United States has been by far the strongest
international backer of UNSCOM,'' she continued. ``We have provided
indispensable technical and logistical support. We've pushed and
pushed and pushed some more to help UNSCOM break through the
smokescreen of lies and deceptions put out by the Iraqi regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Albright say she is dismayed over the damage that may
have been done to her reputation as a result of the controversy
created by Ritter's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Albright gained early notoriety in the Clinton administration
when, as the American representative to the United Nations, she led
efforts to maintain tough economic sanctions on Iraq despite
flagging international resolve on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter, a former Marine intelligence officer, has said that the
Administration made at least seven efforts since last November to
stymie investigations by the Special Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Albright acknowledged that concerns about creating a
deep split in the United Nations Security Council had prompted her
to question the timing of certain inspections of suspected weapons
sites in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   In confronting Iraq, it is best ``to be able to choose your own
timing and terrain,'' she said on Wednesday. ``Saddam's tantrums
have a political purpose: to spark a reaction, divide the Security
Council, isolate the United States, and diminish support for
sanctions. We have not taken any option off the table, including
military force.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Ritter has criticized Albright and others in the Clinton
administration, he has faced criticism himself from his two former
bosses at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Richard Butler, the chief U.N. arms inspector
for Iraq said that Ritter's testimony on Capitol Hill was often
inaccurate in chronology and detail and had damaged the commission.
</P>
<P>
   And in an interview on Wednesday, Butler's predecessor, Rolf
Ekeus, who is now Sweden's ambassador to the United States, said
that Ritter had sometimes lacked an understanding of the ``big
picture'' of dealing with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to denigrate him at all, because he's a very,
very solid person,'' Ekeus said. ``But he's not in a position to
know all of the considerations that go into decision-making on the
commission.'' He said that in his dealings with Albright, ``I had
always found her to be a strong supporter of UNSCOM.''
</P>
<P>
   In testimony on Wednesday before the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, Martin Indyk, the assistant secretary of state for Near
Eastern affairs, said that Ritter's allegations against the United
States ``had profoundly undermined the perception that UNSCOM is
independent _ and that will make it harder for UNSCOM to do its
job.''

STOCKS FALL AS COMPANIES WARN ON PROFITS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks slumped Wednesday as several companies warned
that third-quarter profits will be lower than expected and euphoria
over possible interest-rate cuts seemed to dissipate.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 155.76 points, or 1.94
percent, to 7,865.02, giving up more than 40 percent of Tuesday's
380.53 point surge _ the biggest point gain ever. The Dow is now in
negative territory for the year, and 15.8 percent below its record
9,337.97 set on July 17.
</P>
<P>
   Comments from Procter &AMP; Gamble and Merrill Lynch about lower
earnings expectations spurred the decline. Procter, the blue-chip
household products and food company, fell 7}, or 9.7 percent, to
71~. It cautioned Wednesday that earnings growth in the current
quarter will be held to mid-single digits. First Call, which tracks
earnings forecasts of securities analysts, had estimated profits at
79 cents, which would have been an 8.2 percent increase from the
period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Another prominent casualty was Merrill Lynch, which slid 6}, or
10.2 percent, to 59\. The investment banking and brokerage giant
had announced after Tuesday's close that it lost $135 million from
its operations in Russia and other emerging markets during July and
August and followed up Wednesday by saying that start-up losses
from its new retail outlet in Japan would be greater than expected,
some $65 million.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings alerts followed Tuesday's euphoria, when investors
and traders had been heartened by a speech last Friday by Alan
Greenspan. The Federal Reserve chairman had said that the risk of
recession had caught up with the risk of inflation, implying that
the central bank might decide to reduce short-term interest rates
to head off contagion from sick economies abroad.
</P>
<P>
   But while investors welcomed what Mary Farrell, senior
investment strategist at Paine Webber, called the ``safety net''
that Greenspan represented, they pointed Wednesday to the
persistent fears of what the sharp slowing of the domestic economy
and exposure to foreign losses is doing to corporate profits. They
also cited political instability, in Washington as well as in
Russia and the Far East.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one after another'' of such earnings disappointments,
combined with the general negative overseas and Washington climate,
that is dragging the market down, Ms. Farrell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things are still with us and have not changed one bit,''
said Marshall Acuff, equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney. ``I
don't think any of the professional money managers would buy into
the strength'' at the week's beginning.
</P>
<P>
   It was widely agreed, part of Tuesday's 380.53-point jump was
somewhat artificial in that it reflected forced purchases by those
who had been caught short, traders who had expected to continue to
profit from the market's seven-week swoon but who were suddenly
frightened that Greenspan's address might have had a lasting
positive effect on the investment climate.
</P>
<P>
   That possibility seemed gone Wednesday, especially when it was
reported in the afternoon that Kenneth Starr, the independent
counsel investigating President Clinton, had sent his report to
Congress. The Dow, which had been down about 100 points since
mid-morning, sank another 50 points in the final 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Other market gauges also closed lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index fell 17.26 points, or 1.69 percent Wednesday, to
1,006.20. The Nasdaq composite index declined 2.19 percent, or
36.31 points, to 1,624.55. Although the technology-heavy Nasdaq
market was down, computer and other high-tech losses were mostly
limited to fractions. Microsoft rose 9/32, to 102 1/4, and Oracle
was up 3/16, to 21 13/16, were among those that managed gains. Some
analysts said they thought there were bargains to be had in
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange more than
doubled gainers, 2,172 to 943, with 418 unchanged. Volume at around
704 million shares was moderate, well under Tuesday's 814.9
million, the 10th busiest day on record.
</P>
<P>
   The declines had been foreshadowed by further bouts of selling
overseas, especially in Hong Kong where the Hang Seng index tumbled
283.80 points, or 3.47 percent, to 7,905.45. Japan's Nikkei index
of 225 issues dropped 157.95 points, or 1.06 percent, to 14,755.54,
despite a cut in its already minuscule overnight bank rate. Fuji
Bank was forced to deny rumors of massive losses in derivatives.
</P>
<P>
   European stock averages fell also with a 2.69 percent in
Germany, 1.09 percent in France and 0.62 of 1 percent in London.
</P>
<P>
   On the Big Board, retailers were hit hard, with Sears Roebuck
tumbling 4 1/8, to 46 3/8, on profit fears, and Wal-Mart was down 1
11/16, to 61 1/16. Stores have mostly benefited from Asian woes,
which have made imported goods cheaper, contributing to the
inability to increase prices of domestic producers.
</P>
<P>
   As for lower sales of American products to Asia, which has
crippled some export-oriented companies, Rosanne Cahn, equity
economist at Credit Suisse First Boston, said this problem is
likely ``more than half over.'' She pointed to Asian-bound exports
that plummeted at a 42 percent annual rate during the first quarter
but that narrowed to a 16 percent rate of decline during the
April-June period.

 &HT;    UNSURE INSURANCE
 &HT;    MEXICO CITY _ Imagine a city of 20 million people with nearly
three million motor vehicles, endless traffic jams, famously
reckless drivers _ and precious few cars with insurance coverage.
 &HT;    You're thinking of Mexico City. Pedestrians and drivers have no
guarantee of compensation if an uninsured car hits them, while
victims with serious injuries must often be treated at public
expense. Culpable motorists are wont to leave accident scenes at
the first opportunity, for fear of financial ruin.
 &HT;    That was all supposed to change this year, at least in the
central half of Mexico City known as the Federal District. Trouble
is, it didn't.
 &HT;    Last June, Federal District Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas delayed
plans to introduce mandatory car insurance, provoking a hail of
criticism from insurance companies and political rivals. The mayor
said he only wanted to iron out some rough spots in the law, which
predates his administration. But cynics wonder if this will be yet
another case of good intentions come to naught.
 &HT;    The SUVA, as the mandatory third-party insurance policy is
known, would have boosted an insurance business that has become
fiercely competitive in recent years. Only about 800,000 of the
Federal District's 2.8 million cars carry any insurance. At an
average SUVA price of US$33 per vehicle, insuring the others for
US$27,000 worth of third party damages would have brought an extra
US$66 million in premiums this year.
 &HT;    Moreover, insurers hoped the SUVA would promote what they call
``an insurance culture.'' Life insurance and home insurance are
even less widespread than car insurance, and the US$4.5 billion
that Mexicans paid in insurance premiums last year represented only
1.2 percent of gross domestic product. Insurers would like to boost
that figure to 3 percent by early next decade, and the potential
has attracted international giants like ING (Holland), Allianz
(Germany) and Metropolitan Life and Aetna (both USA).
 &HT;    ``More than a business in itself, the SUVA is a chance to
develop a culture of insurance in Mexico,'' says Alejandro
Gonzalez, a spokesman for the Mexican Insurance Association. ``This
will teach people what insurance is all about. It's also a way to
protect pedestrians and motorists.''
 &HT;    But there is a problem with the SUVA: out-of-town vehicles would
still have no coverage. Political analysts say Cardenas might have
worried that the policy would look like yet another tax on Federal
District residents. In a worst case scenario, it could be delayed
indefinitely.
 &HT;    As in many other things, however, the Federal District might
lead the rest of the country. In theory, the SUVA will be
implemented in early 1999, and the neighboring state of Mexico
might adopt a similar law. Other states could follow suit, and
optimists dream of national mandatory insurance.
 &HT;    For insurers and accident victims, that would guarantee a happy
ending to the recent brouhaha.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    CURTAINS, BEDSHEETS AND ... AIRPLANE TICKETS?
 &HT;    MEXICO CITY _ Squeezed in between the sewing machines and the
washing machines, the mattresses and the money orders, Alejandro
Amil Serrano is hoping to carve out a unique niche for himself at
an Elektra Mega store in the far south of Mexico City.
 &HT;    Amil Serrano is a reservations agent for the airline Taesa
(Transportes Aereos Ejecutivos). Last May, the no-frills retail
chain and the no-frills airline joined forces and signed an
agreement to offer Taesa reservations and air travel ticketing
through booths in 50 Elektra stores in Mexico City. Reservations
agents are employed directly by the airline. They circuit ride
among a group of Elektra stores, hoping to tap into the retail
giant's low-income customer base. For Elektra, whose CEO and
president Ricardo Salinas Pliego has carved an empire by learning
to sell to people with minimal purchasing power, the deal seems
like a marriage made in no-frills consumer heaven. The retail chain
will receive a commission on each Taesa ticket that is sold in its
stores. For the financially troubled airline, the deal with
Elektra, which offers at least potential access to Salinas Pliego's
aggressive marketing via his TV Azteca network, is just one more
tenuous lease on life.
 &HT;    Taesa burst onto the Mexican aviation scene in 1988, beginning
as an air taxi service. The airline quickly added charter, air
cargo and scheduled carrier divisions and now flies to 21
destinations within Mexico and four in the United States. With
cut-rate fares and a bargain-basement operational style (Taesa owns
no aircraft), the airline proved to be a major challenge to
Mexico's national flag carriers, Aeromexico and Mexicana. But Taesa
was hard hit by Mexico's economic crisis and has since hovered on
the brink of bankruptcy. It is one of several Mexican companies
currently in the hands of the controversial bank bailout fund known
as Fobaproa (Fondo Bancario de Proteccion al Ahorro). Taesa
officials maintain that the airline is the victim of government
favoritism and monopolistic practices employed by Aeromexico and
Mexicana (also in the hands of the same bailout fund.) Last year,
Taesa managed to keep flying thanks to a US$10-million loan from
the Singapore-based International Air Finance. When the agreement
with Elektra was announced in May, Taesa CEO Captain Alberto Abed
was optimistic that the unique arrangement would earn the airline
an additional 60,000 to 80,000 passengers a year and generate up to
US$10 million in additional revenue. Amil Serrano is counting on
it.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ In an attempt to lift Japan out of its worst recession
since World War II, the nation's central bank said Wednesday that
it would reduce an important interest rate to the extraordinarily
low level of 0.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of Japan had resisted lowering rates, in part because
they were already the lowest in the world. Wednesday, however, the
bank conceded that the nation needed to prevent the economy _ which
is already staggering under a burden of shrinking demand, tumbling
corporate profit, sliding prices and rising unemployment _ from
sinking further.
</P>
<P>
   The rate cut, intended to make funds cheaper, comes as
economists here and abroad have been calling on Japan to stimulate
the economy, the world's second largest, and help avert recession
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But with Japanese interest rates negligible, it will be
extremely difficult for the central bank here to shape monetary
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may have used their last bullet,'' said Robert Alan
Feldman, chief economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in Tokyo.
``They've already cut rates this far and it's probably helped, but
it hasn't offset head winds from elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Traders reacted sharply, sending Japan's currency down almost 4
percent against the dollar just hours after the announcement. But
the Japanese authorities were willing to risk a loss in the yen,
which had strengthened considerably in recent days, in an attempt
to stimulate economic activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing is appropriate in light of the instability in the
financial markets,'' said Masaru Hayami, the central bank governor,
at a news conference Wednesday night. ``It will help bring
stability to the markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayami tried to deflect speculation that the rate reduction was
made as part of an arrangement, perhaps tacit, with the United
States and other major economies to avert a global slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no international discussion at all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   American and Japanese officials said the prospect of a cut did
not come up during Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa's
meetings on Friday with U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials in Washington have periodically discussed whether
to press Japan for the kind of interest rate cut announced
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the Treasury Department have recently said that a
reduction would signal that Japan would welcome a dose of inflation
_ to counteract the deflation that is afflicting the economy.
Consumers, the thinking goes, would be spurred to make purchases
before inflation sets in, injecting some spending into the economy.
</P>
<P>
   But when interest rates are already hovering just above zero, it
is unclear how much economic activity a rate cut can generate. And
in any case, American officials say, Japan's problem has not been
that rates are too high, but rather that many banks will not lend
money at all as they try to stave off insolvency.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be a help,'' said an American official in
Washington who is involved with the Asian crisis, ``but not much of
a help. By itself, it won't accomplish much.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The interest rate cut is more significant in signaling a shift
in policy than in its ability to make funds much cheaper. The
overnight interbank rate _ similar to the Federal funds rate in the
United States _ has been just under one half of a percent for the
last three years. By contrast, the rate in the United States is 5.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the central bank here had until now resisted lowering
the interest rate was that all but one of its nine policy board
members had said they wanted to save a rate cut for a real economic
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Another way of easing monetary policy is to increase the money
supply by effectively printing more money and pouring it into the
financial system. But it is a step that the bank has shied away
from because it is not as precise as manipulating interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, however, the central bank also said it would supply a
large amount of liquidity into the money market, if necessary,
regardless of the level of overnight interest rates. Doing so, in
essence, could make the borrowing of funds virtually free.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a welcome development but it's probably too little, too
late,'' said Peter Morgan, an economist with HSBC Securities here.
``They think that things are bad enough that they can break the
glass and bring about a rate cut.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a speech in Washington, David Komansky, chief executive
of Merrill Lynch, said Wednesday that he doubted an interest rate
cut ``by itself would be enough to stimulate the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to begin to make progress in Japan,'' Komansky said
to the National Press Club, ``our feeling is that the financial
industry, primarily the banks, have to be restructured and there
have to be permanent tax cuts. These are going to be very, very
painful moves. But unless these actions are taken, or until such
times as these actions are taken, I would doubt'' that the
quarter-point rate cut would affect the Japanese economy.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank's move came a day after a top economic
official, Taichi Sakaiya, released an assessment saying that
Japan's economy is in an ``extremely severe'' situation. Sakaiya
added that the global economy was ``at the threshold of an
extremely difficult phase.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, the Bank of Japan acknowledged that the level
of economic activity had fallen considerably, adding it did not
deny the possibility of a ``further deterioration.''
</P>
<P>
   The further shrinkage in the economy _ deflation _ is
particularly worrisome because the government has been trying to
increase growth through public spending. It is carrying out big tax
cuts and is already beginning to pour about about $120 billion into
the economy as part of a huge fiscal-stimulus package.
</P>
<P>
   The Finance Ministry earlier in the day released figures showing
that capital spending in the second quarter fell 10.6 percent from
the similar period a year earlier, the largest drop in years.
</P>
<P>
   And with deflation, real interest rates become higher for
borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   Hayami, the central bank governor, said that Wednesday's rate
change was made in part to prevent Japan's economy from ``falling
into a deflationary spiral,'' in which prices and profits begin
collapsing at an increasingly rapid speed.
</P>
<P>
   Both Sakaiya's remarks and the Bank of Japan's policy change
come two days before Japan is scheduled to release economic data
for the second quarter, and some economists said these moves could
be a foreshadowing of more bad economic news.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's economy shrank in the first quarter at an annualized
rate of 5.3 percent, and while some economists had expected the
economy in the second quarter to contract by less than one percent
on an annual basis, that perhaps may be too optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's banks and corporations will settle their half-year
accounts at the end of this month. One of the central bank's main
concerns is to pervent a sudden liquidity squeeze as businesses
negotiate for funds to settle contracts and close their accounts.
It was such a squeeze last fall that helped lead to the failure of
four financial institutions and a market meltdown that still causes
shudders among banking and financial officials in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they know something about the financial system,'' said
Feldman at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in stock market trading earlier Wednesday, investors
drove down the share price of Fuji Bank, as rumors circulated that
the bank had sustained huge losses of about two trillion yen, or
$14.6 billion, from derivatives, financial instruments that create
value from underlying securities and bonds. Terunobu Maeda, a
managing director at Fuji Bank, denied the rumor at a news
conference Wednesday, saying it was ``totally groundless.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have lost about 15.5 billion yen at most,'' he said,
referring to about $113 million in losses. Fuji Bank's share price
has fallen by more than half over the past two months, and
Wednesday, it hit a yearly low of 320 yen at one point in trading.
</P>
<P>
   After the close of the market Wednesday, Daiwa Securities said
it recorded losses of about 14 billion yen ($105 million) on
Russian, Latin American, Asian and other emerging market debt in
August. It was the latest in a series of institutions to announce
such losses.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Bank of Japan cut interest rates was in
September 1995, when it lowered the official discount rate, the
overnight rate that the central bank charges to private banks, to
half a percent. Bankers say it is unlikely to touch that rate for
now. The interbank rate that it lowered Wednesday is essentially
the money market rate that banks charge each other when they lend
money overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The financial system has been teetering as Parliament debates
how to deal with the nation's very large and very sick banks. In
particular, at issue is the fate of the Long-Term Credit Bank of
Japan, one of the largest institutions with 25 trillion yen, or
$182 billion, in assets
</P>
<P>
   The government wants to use tax money to save the bank, while
the opposition parties want strict conditions for doing so. The
debate had stymied the passage of six bills that the government
hopes will stabilize the financial system.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, however, the governing Liberal Democratic Party and
the opposition groups seemed close to a compromise that would allow
for a quick passage of the financial legislation, perhaps before
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi visits the United States to meet
President Clinton later this month. &QL;

 &HT;    SEGUROS INSEGUROS
 &HT;    MEXICO D.F. _ Imaginese una ciudad de 20 millones de habitantes
con casi tres millones de vehiculos, embotellamientos permanentes
de trafico, conductores notoriamente negligentes y muy pocos autos
asegurados.
 &HT;    Ese es el caso de la ciudad de Mexico. Los peatones y
conductores no tienen garantia alguna de compensacion si un auto no
asegurado los golpea, mientras que las victimas de lesiones graves
con frecuencia dependen de las instituciones publicas para su
tratamiento. Muchos conductores sencillamente abandonan el lugar
del accidente por temor a quedarse en la ruina.
 &HT;    Todo eso debia cambiar este ano, al menos en el Distrito
Federal. El problema es que no sucedio como se esperaba. En junio
pasado, el alcalde de la capital mexicana, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas,
demoro los planes de establecer la obligatoriedad de seguros para
los automotores, lo que provoco una ola de criticas de las
companias de seguros y de sus rivales politicos. El alcalde dijo
que solo queria modificar algunos detalles de la ley, que comenzo a
redactarse antes que el ocupara el cargo.
 &HT;    El Seguro para el Uso de Vehiculos Automotores (SUVA), como se
conoce la poliza obligatoria de seguros contra danos a terceros,
habria significado un tremendo empujon para la industria de
seguros. Solo unos 800.000 de los casi tres millones de autos de la
capital mexicana estan asegurados. Con un precio promedio de US$33
por vehiculo, que asegura a terceros por un valor de US$27.000, el
SUVA habria significado US$66 millones adicionales en primas este
ano.
 &HT;    Lo que es mas, los aseguradores esperaban que el SUVA promoviera
``una cultura del seguro.'' Los seguros de vida y de viviendas son
incluso menos comunes que los de automoviles, y los US$4.500
millones que los mexicanos pagan al ano por concepto de polizas
solo representaron un 1,2 por ciento del PIB. A los aseguradores
les gustaria elevar esa cifra al 3 por ciento para principios de la
proxima decada, y el potencial ha atraido a gigantes del sector
como ING (Holanda), Allianz (Alemania) y Metropolitan Life y Aetna
(Estados Unidos).
 &HT;    ``Mas que un negocio, el SUVA es una oportunidad para
desarrollar una cultura del seguro,'' explica Alejandro Gonzalez,
de la Asociacion Mexicana de Entidades de Seguros. Pero el SUVA
tiene un problema: los vehiculos de fuera de la capital no estan
cubiertos. Los analistas politicos afirman que quizas a Cardenas le
parecio que la poliza pudiera verse como un impuesto.
 &HT;    Pero como en otras cosas, el Distrito Federal pudiera liderar al
resto del pais. En teoria, el SUVA se pondra en practica a
principios de 1999, y el vecino estado de Mexico pudiera adoptar
una ley similar, ejemplo que quizas sigan despues los demas estados
del pais. Ademas, los optimistas suenan con la obligatoriedad del
seguro de automoviles a nivel nacional.
 &HT;    Para los aseguradores y las victimas, eso garantizaria un final
feliz al reciente alboroto.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    SE VENDE SABANAS, TOALLAS Y ... BOLETOS DE AVION!
 &HT;    MEXICO D.F. _ Rodeado por maquinas de coser y lavadoras,
colchones y giros postales, Alejandro Amil Serrano espera ocupar un
nicho en una megatienda Elektra en la capital mexicana.
 &HT;    Amil Serrano es un agente de reservaciones de la aerolinea
Taesa. En mayo, la cadena minorista y la aerolinea unieron fuerzas
para vender pasajes aereos y reservaciones de Taesa en quioscos en
las 50 tiendas Elektra del DF. Los agentes de reservaciones son
empleados de la aerolinea que recorren varias tiendas con la
esperanza de sacar partido a la base de consumidores de bajos
ingresos del gigante minorista.
 &HT;    Para Elektra, cuyo presidente, Ricardo Salinas Pliego, ha creado
un imperio basado en las ventas a personas con poder adquisitivo
minimo, el acuerdo semeja un matrimonio en el paraiso de los
consumidores sencillos. La cadena minorista recibira una comision
por cada boleto de Taesa que se venda en sus establecimientos. Para
la aerolinea, que encara problemas financieros, el pacto con
Elektra, que ofrece por lo menos un acceso potencial al energico
mercadeo de Salinas Pliego a traves de su cadena TV Azteca,
representa un asidero.
 &HT;    Taesa arranco en 1988 como un servicio de taxi aereo. La linea
agrego rapidamente divisiones de vuelos programados, fletados y
carga aerea, y ahora vuela a 21 ciudades mexicanas y a cuatro de
EU. Con tarifas reducidas y un sistema de operaciones de bajo
costo, se convirtio en un desafio serio para las grandes lineas
nacionales de Mexico, Aeromexico y Mexicana. Pero la crisis
economica golpeo fuertemente a Taesa, que desde entonces ha estado
al borde de la bancarrota. Es una de las empresas mexicanas que
estan en manos del controversial fondo de rescate conocido como
Fobaproa (Fondo Bancario de Proteccion al Ahorro). Los ejecutivos
de Taesa sostienen que la aerolinea es victima del favoritismo del
gobierno y de los metodos monopolicos empleados por Aeromexico y
Mexicana (tambien en manos del mismo fondo de rescate).
 &HT;    El ano pasado, Taesa se las arreglo para seguir volando gracias
a un prestamo de US$10 millones de International Air Finance, de
Singapur. Cuando se anuncio el acuerdo con Elektra en mayo, el
capitan Alberto Abed, presidente ejecutivo de Taesa, manifesto con
optimismo que el exclusivo convenio le daria a la aerolinea entre
60.000 y 80.000 pasajeros mas al ano y generaria hasta US$10
millones en ingresos adicionales.
 &HT;    Amil Serrano cuenta con eso.

IF IT'S GHASTLY, WHY IS EVERYONE LAUGHING? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Sept. 13)  
 Ted Loos writes frequently about arts and entertainment from New
York.  
 (bl)  
 By TED LOOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a darkened Manhattan screening room, the
disintegration of a family is unfolding, including incidents of
everything from divorce to pedophilia. Seated in the audience, film
director John Waters is laughing. So are the other viewers,
although they are also shifting uncomfortably in their seats.
</P>
<P>
   The film, Todd Solondz's ``Happiness,'' is provoking the desired
response: a mixture of humor and horror. Like Solondz's 1996 debut
feature, ``Welcome to the Dollhouse,'' ``Happiness'' mines trauma
for laughs (and makes the watchers wonder why they are laughing).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's proof that no subject matter is off limits anymore in
American comedy,'' said Waters, no stranger to outrageous comedy
himself. ``It shocked with wit, anger and this brutal sense of
humor,'' added the director, whose somewhat lighter comedy
``Pecker'' is opening later this month. ``I think some of the best
comedy is always based on anger.''
</P>
<P>
   He is not alone. This season's writers and directors seem to
agree that disturbing material can be a laughing matter. Several
fall releases _ also including ``Very Bad Things,'' ``Clay
Pigeons'' and ``Home Fries'' _ are self-proclaimed dark comedies, a
genre Waters dubbed ``feel-bad comedies.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of them puts ordinary characters in extraordinary
situations, a classic comic technique updated with some cruelly
imaginative violence that is physical or psychological, or both.
They all involve at least one dead body _ and some involve many,
many more, recalling Alfred Hitchcock's classic of the genre, ``The
Trouble With Harry'' (1955).
</P>
<P>
   What is most noteworthy about this latest batch of dark comedies
is that they strive to move seamlessly between extremes. Similar to
the way that the recent hit comedy ``There's Something About Mary''
has retooled the gross-out genre _ one that Waters practically
invented with movies like ``Pink Flamingos'' (1972) _ these films
career from murder to mirth.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Very Bad Things,'' actor Peter Berg's writing and directing
feature debut, the disposal of a dead friend is played both
seriously and for laughs in the same scene. ``Home Fries,'' which
opens next month, features a helicopter chase that ends in death in
the very first sequence, but later manages to work in an
old-fashioned love story. In the wry thriller ``Clay Pigeons,'' a
brutal stabbing is scored to Elvis Presley's singing ``It's Now or
Never.''
</P>
<P>
   All in all, a risky proposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, the saddest, most tragic things are also the
funniest _ and the funniest things are the saddest and most
tragic,'' said Vince Vaughn, who has one of the season's most
colorful roles as an evil cowboy in ``Clay Pigeons,'' opening Sept.
25. ``You can take anything and make it a comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort both to be noticed and to keep audiences
entertained, writers and directors feel compelled to go further and
further. ``Everything is edgier than it used to be,'' said Matt
Healy, who wrote ``Clay Pigeons.'' ``What offended people 20 years
ago doesn't offend them now.''
</P>
<P>
   While ``Happiness,'' opening on Oct. 16, is setting the pace for
the darkest extremes of family dysfunction, the subject gets a
lighter treatment in ``Home Fries'' _ not that the movie will ever
be confused with Disney fare. For one thing, it features a truly
Machiavellian woman who encourages her sons to commit murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like comedies rooted in a serious story,'' said Catherine
O'Hara, an alumna of the sketch comedy show ``SCTV,'' who plays the
murderous mom. ``They touch on relatable moments in life. You
remember it more than the lighter stuff, which is fun but it
doesn't grab you the same way a darker story does.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Home Fries'' found an unlikely home at Warner Bros., the
studio that this summer released big-budget popcorn movies like
``Lethal Weapon 4'' and ``The Avengers.'' ``In a sense, it's a
guinea-pig picture for the studio,'' said Dean Parisot, the
director of ``Home Fries.'' ``As one executive told me, the movie
cost less than Batman's suit.'' Another major studio, 20th Century
Fox, made an envelope-pushing payoff this summer with the huge
success of ``There's Something About Mary.''
</P>
<P>
   The creators of these offbeat movies _ several of whom are
making writing or directing debuts _ refer to that ``fine line''
between humor and revulsion when describing their challenge. ``That
fine line is easy to cross,'' said Vince Gilligan, who wrote ``Home
Fries'' and is a supervising producer and frequent writer for
television's ``X-Files.'' ``You can cross it and not realize it _
until the audience doesn't laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clay Pigeons'' pushes the line back even further. In the first
scene, the fictional small town of Mercer, Mont., is disrupted when
Clay Bidwell (Joaquin Phoenix) is confronted by his friend Earl for
having an affair with Earl's wife. Earl kills himself and tries to
frame Clay for his death. Things get really bleak, not to mention
absurd, when Clay then gets the blame for a separate string of
grisly murders.
</P>
<P>
   It may not sound like a laugh riot, except for the presence of
the stand-up comic and actress Janeane Garofalo, who plays a
deadpan FBI agent.
</P>

   ``This movie could have been `Badlands,''' said the film's
director, David Dobkin, referring to Terrence Malick's 1973 dark,
solemn thriller. ``It's all about how you look at the material.''

</P>
<P>
   Dobkin and others credit Joel and Ethan Coen, who made the
Oscar-winning ``Fargo'' (1996), for popularizing the genre.
```Fargo' turned a lot of people around,'' said Dobkin. ``You can't
do black comedy better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the audience is persuaded to care about the characters in
``Fargo,'' they also laugh at the wackily violent mishaps that
befall those characters. At its best, black comedy makes its
audience vulnerable, and to some it is therefore more intelligent.
``Comedy can't be dark without some irony, or without some wry
insights to the human condition,'' said Dobkin. As the ``Clay
Pigeons'' screenwriter, Healy, put it, ``You don't write jokes for
black comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, his script started as a thriller and became comedic
along the way. ``It played even funnier than I wrote it,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   One way of giving the dark doings a humorous twist is through
music. Just as ``Clay Pigeons'' treats viewers to Elvis as they
watch a character come to a horrific end, ``Very Bad Things,''
which is to open in November, uses upbeat Cuban jazz to frame a
series of deaths and messy cleanups. ``You want to give the
audience a chance to breathe, and to laugh,'' said the ``Very Bad
Things'' director, Berg.
</P>
<P>
   In this exceedingly dark comedy, starring Christian Slater,
Cameron Diaz, Daniel Stern, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Jon Favreau and
Jeremy Piven, five men travel to Las Vegas for a bachelor party,
and when one of them accidentally kills a prostitute, a series of
savage betrayals is set in motion. Though ``Very Bad Things'' may
be on the cutting edge of violence, it forces regular people into
absurd acts, as comedies often do. ``The results are disastrous,''
said Berg, ``but also somewhat humorous.''
</P>
<P>
   So how dark can a film be and still provoke laughter? ``For the
movie to work the way I wanted it to work, I had to run the risk of
offending people,'' said Berg. But he also found that
hard-to-define line easy to cross. ``When I saw the first cut of
the film, I was terrified at how unfunny and nasty it was,'' he
said. ``For the next eight weeks, it was a systematic endeavor to
cut back the gruesome intensity and increase the laughs.''
</P>
<P>
   And preview audience members have told him, he said, that ``they
were laughing but couldn't figure out why they were laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   That confusion is endemic to this breed of film. Healy, whose
``Clay Pigeons'' script was among his first major writing efforts,
has seen the risk pay off professionally: He now has a two-picture
deal at Warner Bros. Personally, though, the unpredictable
reactions to these types of dark comedies are keeping him on edge.
``I'm getting married the weekend it opens,'' said Healy.
``Actually, I'm still pretty nervous about the in-laws seeing the
movie.''

SPORTS COLUMN: 62 SWINGS THAT LIFTED A SPORT  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   As Mark McGwire gave those moving and heartfelt hugs to the
Maris children Tuesday night, embracing the magnificence of a
37-year-old record even as he'd broken it, I recalled a
conversation last summer with Ken Griffey Jr. in which he
speculated that the bar may have been raised too high for a
baseball player to come across larger than life.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, it didn't matter what other athletes did; they
were all second-class citizens to those in the big leagues. Then
along came 80-channel cable systems to level the promotional field,
and sneaker companies to fill our living rooms with corporate
propaganda and Michael Jordan to create a superstar level all his
own. Griffey said he understood why some people considered him his
sport's closest commodity to Jordan, but now that basketball was an
industry that was arguably baseball's competitive equal, it was
existentially unfair to compare the two.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basketball is different,'' Griffey said that day in Yankee
Stadium. ``We have 25 guys. Somebody else is going to have to do
the job. My job is the 3 slot.''
</P>
<P>
   He meant that he could only do something about the score when
his turn in the batting order came around, or when the ball flew
his way in center field. Jordan could, theoretically, shoot the
ball on every play, and how could a baseball player compete with
that?
</P>
<P>
   McGwire demonstrated how these past few weeks, by finally
welcoming the challenge and all its inherent distractions and
demands. Greater than any opponent, what McGwire took on was
history, a subject that baseball is practically governed by. In
this arena was a late 20th century ballplayer finally Jordanesque,
with all the humanistic trappings that will help preserve the
images forever.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Jordan won a championship on Father's Day, and
sobbed, face-down, on the locker room floor. It was the first title
he'd won without his murdered father nearby, and another must-see
TV moment for an athlete not wearing spikes.
</P>
<P>
   Most of this decade's indelible sports moments, from Magic
Johnson to Jerry Rice to Tiger Woods, seemed to be elsewhere from
baseball, a tortured sport in the 1990s, without even a World
Series in the summer of its labor discontent, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the following season, baseball was holding up Cal
Ripken Jr. as its peace offering. Ripken broke another cherished
record, Lou Gehrig's 2,130 consecutive games played. I remember
sitting in the auxiliary press box out in left field that night in
Orioles Park at Camden Yards, watching Ripken lap the field,
writing that he was more than shaking hands with fans; he was
pulling them back to baseball, the ultimate sport for men at work.
</P>
<P>
   Day after hot summer day, game after game, taking cuts in the
cage, sitting in the dugout, waiting for a chance. The limitations
Griffey spoke of also happen to be part of baseball's lore. Each
turn is a precious opportunity, another success or failure to
record. And so numbers _ records _ mean more than they do in any
other game.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the season, McGwire was in public denial on the most
exalted record, the home-run chase. He wasn't about to be talked
out of it by clusters of reporters who claimed to represent the
interests of fans. Reporters, he understood, have their own
ambitions. The very good ones _ like Steve Wilstein of The
Associated Press _ use their eyes and ears and sometimes end up not
writing about what they originally thought they would.
</P>
<P>
   So McGwire had the open-ended controversy of his use of the
nutritional supplement androstenedione to deal with, but by then he
was at 50 home runs and counting. The overwhelming response from
those jamming the ball parks enlightened him, freed him from his
own apprehension. He had moved on from the
imagine-how-tough-it-must-be commentary filling the airwaves.
McGwire, with Sammy Sosa trailing behind, was having a blast.
</P>
<P>
   The most beautiful part of his 62d home run was that, at the
moment of impact, he was no contemporary churl, taking it all for
granted, standing at the plate, admiring his art. He bolted from
the batter's box like a wild-eyed kid, and almost forgot to touch
first base. It reminded me, yes, of Jordan in Salt Lake City,
celebrating his sixth title, 35 going on 15.
</P>
<P>
   Even Mr. Basketball grew up with _ and a few years ago tried to
enact _ the dream of doing something special with a bat. Is it just
coincidence that his agent, David Falk, now says that Jordan wants
to play again next season?
</P>
<P>
   We were all inspired Tuesday night. But if McGwire hits 70, how
can Jordan compete with that?
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH PORTLAND, Maine _ When Howard Patterson strode to the
podium here in August, he was applauded wildly by several dozen car
dealers, each of whom had paid from $25,000 to $60,000 to acquire a
franchise for the fledgling Eurasia Motor Corp. of Fort Lauderdale,
Fla. Patterson, Eurasia's chief executive, had promised to deliver
a line of vehicles called Gazelles, ranging from a $5,995 sedan to
the $30,000 Avalanche, ``the largest sport utility vehicle ever
produced.''
</P>
<P>
   For 18 months, the dealers had seen nothing but pictures of a
quickly changing mix of vehicles, but now, they thought, they were
moments away from the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Not that every Eurasia dealer had waited patiently. ``I think it
was a scam from the very beginning,'' said Chuck Pond, owner of
Action Automotive in Mobile, Ala., who paid $25,000 that was
supposed to be set aside in an escrow account only to discover that
Eurasia got the money. He is one of at least nine dealers who are
suing or pressing complaints against Eurasia to try to get their
money back from what many fear was a coast-to-coast swindle.
</P>
<P>
   If the dealers who are suing are right, it is a highly unusual
swindle, one aimed not at the elderly and the gullible, but at car
dealers, typically among the shrewdest people around.
</P>
<P>
   But then Patterson is a persuasive fellow. ``Howard can make you
believe anything,'' said Jene Jones, his former secretary. ``He can
make you believe the sun will go down at noon.''
</P>
<P>
   Publicity about Eurasia has largely been limited to skeptical
accounts in the trade publication Automotive News, but there have
been a number of red flags.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Porter, a lawyer from Colorado representing many of the
dealers, said Eurasia raised as much as $10 million in less than
two years. Neither he nor a Miami collection agency hired by
Simpson Honda of Bozeman, Mont., however, can find evidence that it
now has any of that.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to spawning lawsuits by dealers in six states,
Eurasia has left a trail of unpaid debts to suppliers and
employees. In recent months it has been evicted from buildings in
Texas and Florida. Moreover, the company's No. 2 executive is a
convicted felon.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Patterson, through his lawyer, Alexander Lasnaud of
Boca Raton, Fla., declined to say when or where he was born or to
provide a resume, but he acknowledged that he is also known as
Michael Howard Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews in South Portland, though, Patterson, who at 40 is
tanned and well muscled, denied any impropriety, saying that
Eurasia Motors is legitimate and ``the victim of a conspiracy by
former employees.''
</P>
<P>
   But he declined to answer questions about how checks written to
the trust account of his company's former general counsel ended up
with his company. And he would not talk about Eurasia marketing
director Jules Pier, whom he calls his most trusted aide. Pier,
Florida records show, is on active probation for grand theft in a
1996 case. Pier declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment Eurasia was born in January 1997, there were
signs that its public image did not match reality.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson said he was the sole owner, but incorporation papers
list the owners as Michaelann Konko, his companion, and Jill Pier,
Jules Pier's wife.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Eurasia often revised its brochures and videos,
which promised sport utility vehicles to be built in Britain or
Romania or South Africa or Brazil or Texas. Engines were to be
supplied by Cosworth or Ford or Chrysler or Citroen or Daewoo or
Peugeot. But one company after another issued statements disavowing
any ties to Eurasia.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall the company repeatedly promised to display a vehicle
at the National Automobile Dealers Association annual meeting in
New Orleans. No vehicle materialized.
</P>
<P>
   By early summer, dealers from Alabama, Arizona, Colorado,
Florida, Montana and South Dakota sued Eurasia, some for fraud. A
few called the Federal Bureau of Investigation, as did some
employees. The bureau issued subpoenas, and one employee said he
was asked to gather evidence, but early this year the bureau
apparently dropped the case. The agent working the case did not
return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Eurasia kept signing up dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Even many dealers who know about the lawsuits hold Patterson in
high regard. Bob Lanphere, head of a family business with seven
dealerships in Oregon and Washington and the owner of two Eurasia
franchises and a parts distributorship, spoke admiringly of him
during the event in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   He dismissed the suits as the product of ``naysayers out there
doing more harm than good and putting roadblocks to Howard's
reaching his dream.'' He added later that he hoped ``this all works
out because I've got $170,000 in this.''
</P>
<P>
   In a hotel meeting room in South Portland, Patterson toyed with
his Rolex as his public relations man, Bob Holtzman of Citigate
Communications, rallied a group of dealers, the room throbbing to
the beat of Neil Diamond singing ``Coming to America.''
</P>
<P>
   When his moment came, the music tapered off and Patterson leaned
into the microphone. ``I could stand here for hours and tell you
stories of corporate intrigue,'' he said, ``but I don't think
that's what you are here for, so let's go see some Gazelles.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside, protected by two police officers, stood three vehicles.
``They have cars,'' said an excited Jacob Amuial, a used-car dealer
in Norfolk, Va. ``Now we know this is for real.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was open to question. One tiny car stood with both
doors locked, its hood closed, its emblem torn from the black
plastic grille. It was _ said a man who identified himself as
Catalin Tulano _ an Oltcit, a Citroen-designed vehicle last made
several years ago in Romania.
</P>
<P>
   Tulano said that he owned ``all the tools and dies and rights to
this car'' and that the machinery, now in crates in a Romanian
warehouse, would soon be shipped to Mexico so he could build cars
for Eurasia. Tulano would not give his company's name and address
or the location of the Mexican factory.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby stood a pair of off-road vehicles, a yellow truck and
what looked like a Jeep on steroids, painted red with a black
canvas top. They were consumer versions of French military vehicles
and built at JPX, a small factory in Pouso Alegre, Brazil. In six
years the factory has produced 6,000, mostly for sale in former
French colonies in Africa, according to Francois Servanin, a former
race-car driver who said he has a contract to build vehicles in the
factory.

 SOUTH PORTLAND: the factory.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   People lined up for test drives of the off-road vehicles, which
proved sturdy, underpowered and hard to steer. Patterson said he
would import 10,000 to 20,000 a year from Brazil, starting in
December. The tiny sedan, to be called the Modesto, would be
available in 1999, to be followed by the Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche featured in one brochure is made by Jurassic
Truck, in Arlington, Texas, which says it has no connection to
Eurasia and whose owner, Timothy Barton, is cooperating with
dealers suing Eurasia.
</P>
<P>
   Neither off-road vehicle had air bags or emission controls, but
Patterson told the crowd that they would be approved within three
months. Spokesmen for the Environmental Protection Agency and the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said they had no
record of Eurasia, the Gazelle brand, Patterson or his top
associates. Clean-air approvals could take more than a year, said
Steve Page of the EPA.
</P>
<P>
   While Patterson said Eurasia was financially sound, it was
evicted from buildings in Corpus Christi, Texas, in the spring, and
in Fort Lauderdale in August.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson said he was unaware of any unpaid rent or evictions.
``I am the CEO, and lower-level people deal with things like that,
if that happened,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nine former employees said they were out tens of thousands of
dollars for wages, expenses and advances made to Eurasia at
Patterson's request. Patterson said no one had ever told him about
bounced checks. Two former employees who handled money paid by
newly signed dealers said in interviews that all of it was diverted
to Patterson and his associates.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Feldman, Eurasia's treasurer until she left last fall, said
in an affidavit filed in federal court in Colorado that money from
new dealers was ``used to finance a lavish life style'' for
Patterson and others, not ``for the acquisition, development,
importation, certification, purchase and sale of the Gazelle or any
other vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Feldman, who said Eurasia charged $18,000 to her personal
credit cards, said she came to believe it ``was created solely as a
fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones, who became Patterson's secretary when Eurasia moved
to Corpus Christi in late 1997, said that when each dealer's check
came in, she was instructed to wire the money immediately to a bank
account whose ownership and location she did not know.
</P>
<P>
   She and three other former employees said that as bills piled up
and paychecks bounced, Patterson acquired a Mercedes-Benz sports
car, a Harley-Davidson motorcycle, a couple of Rolex watches, lived
in a stylish waterfront home on Padre Island and sailed a yacht.
</P>
<P>
   Jurgen Sass, Eurasia's parts and service manager in Corpus
Christi, said he never saw any evidence that money was spent on
parts or tools. He said that to stop one eviction, he personally
paid $6,800 in rent, which he never got back.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones said people kept working when paychecks stopped
because they believed in Patterson. But he left town in May without
paying them, the employees said.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson said he had never improperly taken dealers' money.
``My wife and I do not live a lavish life style,'' he said. ``We
live appropriate to our means.'' Later, through Lasnaud, he
declined to comment on Ms. Feldman's statement and Ms. Jones'
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Eurasia also faces problems with multiple sales of franchises in
the same region. Robert Ingram of Norfolk, Va., and Robert Crumpler
of Newport News, Va., each paid $30,000 for exclusive Gazelle
franchises in the same territory as Amuial.
</P>
<P>
   Ingram, a used-car dealer who went into debt to buy his
franchise, and Crumpler, a Nissan dealer, said they would gladly
back out if they got their money back.
</P>
<P>
   Court records also show that three dealers paid $30,000 each for
an exclusive franchise for Colorado and that two did so in South
Dakota. Most of those dealers are suing, as are dealers in Montana,
Arizona, Alabama and Florida, some of whom obtained default
judgments in recent weeks when Eurasia did not appear in court to
defend itself.
</P>
<P>
   Could Eurasia live up to its promises? It is a giant leap from
bringing three vehicles to a parking lot in Maine to manufacturing
and importing 20,000 vehicles a year worth more than $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Patterson said he would soon have the financing he needed
because each dealer would have to give Eurasia a $225,000 letter of
credit, to be used as collateral for loans from Union Planters Bank
in Fort Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the unpaid bills, Phillip McNally, a senior vice
president at Union Planters, said the bank was exploring ways to
structure the financing. ``We see an opportunity to do some
business on a legitimate basis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barton, owner of Jurassic Truck, said in an interview that Mark
Weiner, who identified himself as Patterson's brother, came to see
him at the factory where he turns the frames of old Chevrolet
Suburbans into the T-Rex, the world's largest sport utility
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   `` Weiner asked me to make a knock-off of an off-road vehicle
called the Ibex so it could be shown to dealers in New Orleans in
February,'' he said. ``I told him it was a bizarre request but even
if I wanted to there were only a few weeks left and that was not
enough time.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Weiner, who declined to be interviewed, persisted,
saying that with the right approach a knock-off could be made in
time. ``It doesn't have to actually run,'' Barton quoted Weiner as
saying. ``It just has to look the part.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEUSTRELITZ, Germany _ Like many others in this small town in
eastern Germany, Erika Tauber had been out of work since the
textile factory here closed with the fall of communism.
</P>
<P>
   But in June, after years of job hunting and retraining, Mrs.
Tauber, who politely gives her age as in the 50s, suddenly found
work again _ thanks to the German government.
</P>
<P>
   With a national election around the corner and unemployment
receding but still in double digits, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
government has orchestrated an abrupt expansion in temporary job
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Just outside town, unemployed high school graduates have been
given jobs and old-fashioned hand tools to build a replica of a
medieval Slavic village. Other workers are counting trees in the
local forests, renovating schools and crunching up concrete from
demolished buildings.
</P>
<P>
   With Kohl under attack for years of high unemployment, job
programs are critically important in his campaign to win an
unparalleled fifth term, especially in the eastern part of the
country, which has been a crucial base of support for him in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   But with unemployment in the east far higher than the national
rate, Kohl is lagging badly in opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   Since January the government has financed 100,000 new public
service jobs across the depressed eastern states, at an added cost
of nearly $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is clearly using unemployment programs as a
political weapon,'' said Werner Patzelt, a political scientist at
Dresden Technical University. ``The irony is that they are doing
exactly what the Social Democrats have been calling for.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the make-work jobs are all temporary. Most
last for a year, but many of the newest jobs last only six months.
``There isn't any real growth here,'' said Annagret Albrecht as she
sewed a fisherman's costume for a pageant, in one of the publicly
subsidized jobs. ``The only thing that's happening is that people
are being taken off the streets. When the elections are over, our
jobs will be over too.''
</P>
<P>
   With the last-minute spending, Germany's Federal Labor Office
reported on Tuesday that the unemployment rate eased slightly in
August to 10.6 percent from 10.7 percent in July. About 4.1 million
people were without jobs last month, an improvement of about 39,000
people from the July level.
</P>
<P>
   The highest levels of joblessness are in eastern Germany, where
huge, inefficient and overstaffed factories closed after the fall
of the Berlin wall, leaving many people without work. In August the
unemployment rate in the eastern section of the country was 17.1
percent, down from 17.4 percent in July. In the western part of the
country, unemployment in August was 9 percent, down from 9.1
percent the prior month.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Kohl's party, the Christian Democratic Union, nor the
Social Democratic Party, whose candidate is Gerhard Schroder, has
convincing solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists say the problems stem in part from Germany's
high taxes, steep costs of wages and benefits and strict work
rules, but neither side has proposed radical reforms. Both support
a strengthening of job and training programs.
</P>
<P>
   As the aging incumbent, Kohl has the more acute problem. When he
stopped here in late August to campaign, protesters threw eggs and
tried to disrupt his speech with chants of ``Kohl must go!''
</P>
<P>
   Disillusionment abounds. The streets here are plastered with
billboards and placards from far-right parties like the German
People's Union, who campaign against immigrant labor from Eastern
Europe and elsewhere with slogans like ``German money for German
jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the refurbished successor to East Germany's old Communist
Party now has a serious chance of becoming part of the coalition
government in the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, which
includes Neustrelitz. Now called the Party of Democratic Socialism,
the former Communists are expected to win 20 percent of the vote
here.
</P>
<P>
   As the dissatisfaction has grown, the government has vacillated
between cutting spending for job programs and expanding them to
alleviate the severe recession.
</P>
<P>
   During 1997 the Kohl government slashed 100,000 make-work jobs
to reduce its budget deficit. At the time, the government was
struggling to satisfy the strict fiscal requirements for taking
part in the new European currency, the euro.
</P>
<P>
   But in January, after the government met the euro requirements,
it abruptly reversed course. Local governments were given authority
to spend an extra $600 million, and an estimated $300 million was
added for special jobs subsidies in the east. Since the year began,
the number of public make-work jobs in eastern Germany has jumped
from 80,142 to 179,622, according to the labor office.
</P>
<P>
   In the west, where unemployment is lower, the government has
added only 10,000 temporary jobs.
</P>
<P>
   With a rush of public funds, local job offices have been
scrambling to line up workers and projects. Much of the work is
funneled through private contractors that organize scores of public
service projects and take care of the hiring and firing.
</P>
<P>
   The government has been helped by the fact that the country has
been in an economic rebound this year. The Federal Statistics
Office reported on Wednesday that after a 4.3 percent rise in gross
domestic product in the first quarter, second quarter growth slowed
to a 1.7 percent rate. But many economists and government officials
attributed the dip to some one-time factors and said it did not
suggest a slowdown in growth for the year.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, Kohl is taking credit for the slow
decline in unemployment and boasts that the number of jobless
workers will sink below 4 million by November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies are employing people again, not least in the small
to medium-sized companies,'' he said. ``The Social Democrats wanted
to use this rotten mood to win, when they said in January we would
have five million unemployed workers this year. But it hasn't
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But here in eastern Germany, the mood is grim. ``All the work
has been shifted to cheaper countries like Poland, Slovakia or the
Czech Republic,'' said Mrs. Tauber, who found work as a seamstress.
``The problem is, we can't afford to work that cheaply, because it
costs as much to live here as it does in the west.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither party has much of an answer to that. Labor Minister
Norbert Blum, a Christian Democrat, has proposed a new kind of
subsidized job that would be financed by money from the
unemployment benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Democratic Party has called for a bigger and
better-targeted program of make-work jobs and the creation of
100,000 new apprenticeship positions. Schroder, the Social
Democratic candidate for chancellor, has called for a broad but
vague ``alliance for work'' in which the government, unions and
corporations would come up with a plan for hiring more workers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the huge increase in make-work jobs has put Social
Democratic politicians in an awkward position. Though they support
such jobs themselves, they argue that the current crop of make-work
projects include many that are nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a way of polishing the labor statistics,'' said
Harald Rings-torff, head of the Social Democratic bloc in the state
legislature of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. ``There are projects
being approved here that make absolutely no sense for labor policy
and would never have been approved under normal circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many of the jobs are almost pointless, because
government-paid jobs are not supposed to compete in any way with
private industry. Thus, high school graduates are building hundreds
of wooden crates to hold tanks of gasoline. But almost no one uses
such crates since the reunification of Germany, because there now
are 24-hour gas stations on every highway in eastern Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the workers with new jobs are convinced that their
employment will soon evaporate. Many have no intention of voting
for Kohl, though they are not enamored of Schroder either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, Kohl is trying hard to reduce the number of
unemployed people below four million before the election,'' said
Hans-Joachim Stein, 42, a former agronomist, as he built a stone
retaining wall for a canal at a local park. ``But next year the
money will disappear and the number will go back up.''

U.S. TO SEND NORTH KOREA FOOD DESPITE MISSILE LAUNCHING 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States quietly agreed last weekend to
send an unusually large shipment of emergency food aid to North
Korea, despite the North's recent launching of a medium-range
missile over Japan, officials who have been briefed on the talks
between the two countries say.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement to provide additional aid, which has angered
Japan, comes amid growing signs that North Korea was trying to
launch a satellite, as it claims, when it shot off the missile,
according to officials of several countries.
</P>
<P>
   So far the U.S. Space Command, which tracks objects in space,
has said it cannot find evidence of a satellite. But if the
launching amounted to a failed effort to propel a small satellite
into space _ which one official said ``is the most likely scenario
now'' _ it would mean that the initial portrayal of the firing as a
clearly hostile act was partially incorrect.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's decision to provide about 300,000 tons of wheat and
other grains will probably be announced next week, officials said.
The State Department declined to comment, but other officials said
the announcement was being delayed to put some distance between the
missile launching and an American step to keep the North Koreans
talking about curbing their nuclear programs.
</P>
<P>
   Japan sharply protested the launching of the missile and
immediately said it was reviewing all of its aid to the North.
Japanese officials have made no effort to hide their chagrin at the
decision to go ahead with aid, arguing that it rewards North Korea
for bad behavior.
</P>
<P>
   But American officials say the Clinton administration is loath
to become involved in another confrontation with North Korea when
the executive branch is distracted by the Monica Lewinsky scandal
and economic instability around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department, meanwhile, is interested in keeping North
Korea at the negotiating table because of growing fears that the
Communist government may be looking to break out of the 1994 accord
containing its nuclear weapons ability.
</P>
<P>
   In the negotiations last week in New York between American
officials and North Korea, the Pyongyang officials reportedly
agreed to resume a four-year-old process of ``canning'' nuclear
waste at its suspected nuclear-weapons plant in Yongbyon, north of
the Korean capital, Pyongyang. That work had halted recently.
</P>
<P>
   While American officials routinely insist that food aid is
decided on humanitarian grounds, and is never used as a bargaining
chip, diplomats from other countries monitoring the talks say that
the containment of the nuclear material was a key condition.
</P>
<P>
   The talks came as North Korea celebrated its 50th anniversary as
an independent state, and re-elected Kim Jong Il, son of the
country's founder, as chairman of the National Defense Commission,
saying that was now the ``highest post in the state.'' His father,
Kim Il Sung, who died four years ago, was named ``eternal leader.''
The celebrations included parades and no mention of the widespread
starvation that the United Nations says is afflicting the country.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear why American intelligence agencies are having
such a difficult time determining the nature of the launching,
which North Korea declared was part of the 50th-anniversary
celebration. The satellite, it said, was supposed to broadcast
patriotic hymns and odes to Kim Il Sung, but American and Japanese
officials say they have heard nothing in the frequency band that
the North identified for the broadcasts.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The State Department has been cautious in its public statements
about the North. Department spokesman James Rubin said on Tuesday
that the United States sought ``concrete steps to assure that there
is full compliance with all aspects'' of the 1994 accord, and took
up the issue of missile proliferation and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   But he declined to discuss details of the talks, or describe the
agreements reached.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that while it was ``an important question'' whether
a satellite was launched, ``nevertheless there was a missile
launched that demonstrated the capability to deliver a payload
against __ ''
</P>
<P>
   Then he caught himself, continuing, ``at very long range.''
</P>
<P>
   One hint that the North may have been attempting a satellite
launching lies in the unusual flight path of the missile, a
multi-stage Taepodong-1 that has a range of more than 1,200 miles.
</P>
<P>
   There is some evidence that the third stage of the missile,
containing the nose cone, was fired off during the launching. That
would be consistent with an effort to place a small satellite into
orbit.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no question it would be very small. The North has
put a picture of the rocket, or what it says is the rocket, on the
Web page of the North Korean Central News Agency (www.kcna.co.jp)
Its payload bay appears to be very narrow, not nearly large enough
for a traditional communications or spy satellite.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CORAL GABLES, Fla. _ President Clinton pleaded for forgiveness
and another chance Wednesday from his party's leaders and its rank
and file, rallying support even as prosecutors were preparing to
give Congress the boxed results of their eight-month inquiry into
his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The president apologized to House Democrats at a private White
House meeting Wednesday morning and then, sadly and haltingly, to
Democratic donors in a dimly lit Marriott hotel ballroom in Orlando
on Wednesday afternoon. After the representatives urged him to be
more forthright about his mistakes, Clinton told the donors that he
had done his best to be their friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I also let you down,'' he continued in husky tones to his
transfixed audience. ``And I let my family down and I let this
country down. But I'm trying to make it right. And I'm determined
never to let anything like that happen again.'' His expression
somber, Clinton raised his hands to hush the audience as it broke
into applause, then added that he was determined to ``redeem the
trust'' of longtime supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Clinton made his remarks, just before 3 p.m.,
prosecutors dispatched their report to the Congress. The
president's aides said he had not known that the report would be
delivered Wednesday, although press reports indicate he had
expected it soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no one to blame but myself for my self-inflicted
wounds,'' Clinton said, describing these days as the toughest of
his life but perhaps the most valuable as well.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a supportive introduction and warm ovations that
gave the fund-raiser the feel of a support group, the president
made the kind of bid for political redemption that he has told at
least one friend he should have made three weeks ago, when he first
acknowledged an intimate relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he apologized, Clinton urged his audience not to let the
Lewinsky matter become an issue in the fall election, despite what
he said were efforts to make it one by ``a whole lot of people, in
Washington especially,'' as well as by people ``who write about
this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be fooled, not for a minute, not for a day,'' he said.
``Elections are about you and your children and your communities
and your future.'' He went on to recall his record and to present
his agenda for education, health care, Social Security and other
issues.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At an hour-long meeting Wednesday morning over coffee and danish
in the Yellow Room of the White House residence, the president made
what participants called an emotional apology to the House
Democratic leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows he has done something that has been very, very
difficult not only for his family but for the country,'' said Rep.
David Bonior, D-Mich., the minority whip. ``The president did not
cry, but you could tell by the way he was breathing, you could tell
by his demeanor, that he felt the pain, and he felt it very
strongly.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonior said the group did not discuss the possibility of
resignation or impeachment, and that it forgave Clinton for his
behavior. But he said he told Clinton that he would have to express
sorrow and contrition to the American people forcefully and
repeatedly for weeks and maybe months.
</P>
<P>
   The president flew here this evening from Orlando to raise
$700,000 over dinner for the Florida Democratic party. The
president's advisers had said that they expected a further public
apology from him this week, but they professed surprise that he
chose to make it Wednesday. Clinton was scribbling on a copy of his
speech at his table during the fund-raiser in Orlando, which raised
$300,000 for the Florida Democrats. He informed a senior aide,
Douglas Sosnik, of his intentions only moments before he spoke, a
White House official said.
</P>
<P>
   After taking heat from political allies for a week, Clinton was
among foul-weather friends Wednesday, and he was clearly grateful.
Outside the hotel, about 75 protesters carried signs like ``Resign
You Swine'' and ``Impeach the Ozark Caligula.'' But inside, the
president spoke after Florida Lt. Gov. Buddy MacKay, the Democratic
nominee for governor, praised his leadership. One Democratic
candidate, Maryland Gov. Parris Glendenning, recently canceled a
planned fund-raiser with Clinton over the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay, who is trailing Republican nominee Jeb Bush, called
Clinton a stalwart friend of Florida. ``Martin Luther King once
said, `We will remember not the words of our enemies but the
silence of our friends,' '' MacKay said. ``Mr. President, we are
not going to be silent. We are going to speak out in support of the
work you are doing.'' He was drowned out by applause.
</P>
<P>
   As he took his place behind the lectern to a shout of ``We love
you, Bill!'' Clinton told that audience of about 350 that they had
been ``astonishingly kind and generous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If God lets me live to be an old man, I will never forget what
Buddy MacKay said today from this platform, when he could have said
nothing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton described shaking hands with children at the Hillcrest
elementary school in Orlando this morning, where he promoted his
education agenda. One boy _ ``kind of husky,'' the president said,
as he had been as boy _ told Clinton that he would like to be a
president like him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, I want to be able to conduct my life and my
presidency so that all the parents of the country could feel good
if their children were able to say that again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he hoped this would be a time of ``reconciliation and
healing'' that would help millions of families grow stronger.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was impressed. ``What I heard today is what I've
always heard about Bill Clinton, that he's an effective speaker,''
said Jon Pohl, an architect who called himself an independent but
said he was supporting MacKay. ``But that doesn't change what he's
done.'' Pohl said Clinton ``will never be able to say what I want
him to say. I want him to say that he's stepping down.''
</P>
<P>
   But Carol Foglesong, the recorder of deeds for Orange County,
said she did not need to hear the apology, although other Americans
might. ``It was the right amount,'' she said. ``He said he was
sorry. But the question is, `Where do we go from here?' ''

PROCTER &AMP; GAMBLE WARNS ON EARNINGS, UNVEILS REORGANIZATION PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. warned Wednesday that its first-quarter
results would be weaker than expected because of flat sales in
Europe and the financial crisis in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The warning came as the company announced perhaps the most
sweeping changes in its 160-year history, details of a
reorganization to encourage speedier global product development and
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble, the maker of Pampers diapers, Pringles potato
chips and, most recently, olestra, the re-engineered fat also said
that president Durk Jager would become chief executive next
January, succeeding John Pepper.
</P>
<P>
   But investors appeared to focus on the sales growth projections,
as shares of Procter &AMP; Gamble tumbled 9.7 percent on the New York
Stock Exchange. The shares fell $7.75, to $71.875, contributing
nearly 32 points to the 155.76-point decline in the Dow Jones
industrial average.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is concerned about that fact that the September
quarter volume trends are coming in below expectations, and there
have been a couple of quarters in a row where the volume has been
soft,'' said Amy Low Chasen, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs.
Nevertheless, she added, ``This organizational change is really
positive from a long-term standpoint, over the next one to two
years, because it should accelerate earnings and volume growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepper, who will continue as P&AMP;G's chairman until September
1999, said the reorganization was essential to make the company
more efficient and competitive worldwide, both in terms of
developing new products and getting them into stores and people's
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, P&AMP;G will switch from its present four business
groups, which are divided geographically, to seven ``global
business units'' based on product lines. Each unit (examples
include ``baby care'' and ``tissue and towel'') will be in charge
of its own research and development, personnel, information
technology and other related operational needs.
</P>
<P>
   The company says it is also committed to changing its reward
systems, training program and other facets of corporate culture to
encourage bolder innovation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Innovation is our lifeblood,'' said Pepper, who has pledged to
double P&AMP;G's business over 10 years. ``We need to move faster.
We're used to taking four years to get a new brand out, but we need
to do it in one to two years.'' Indeed, the most recent annual
report complained that new products did not emerge fast enough, and
its letter to shareholders foreshadowed the reorganization that was
detailed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Jager said, new product development was hampered by
the company's structure, as in the case of a product called
Febreeze, which removes odors from clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We developed it some time ago, and it was paid for by the
North American profit center,'' he said. ``It went out to other
test markets eventually, and became extremely successful. You
looked back and said, why didn't we plan on this being expanded
globally from the beginning?''
</P>
<P>
   The reorganization, Ms. Chasen said, ``should accelerate the
pace of new product activity because you have everybody from a
product category thinking and brainstorming, and that should
logically accelerate the rate at which those products go to
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepper said the new structure was developed from a vision he and
Jager shared, but with plenty of input from employees who voiced
their opinions, he said, in lunchrooms and surveys. ``We have had a
consultant working on it in the last 12 months,'' he said, ``but
this was our work. The only way this would be done well would be to
be led from the top.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, no job cuts have been detailed, although Pepper said
there would certainly be some positions eliminated as a result of
the reorganization. Any announcement, he said, ``is probably three
to six months away.''
</P>
<P>
   He described the company's 110,000 employees as ``upbeat and
positive'' about the reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The view of the people is, `Hallelujah, you are doing what we
wanted,''' Pepper said. ``We were hearing at a lot of our meetings,
`For heaven's sake, be bold.'''
</P>
<P>
   With the desire for new products, each global business unit will
contain business-development groups, Yager said. Then he recited
the new-business motto, ``Make a little, sell a little, learn a
lot, and fail cheap.''

THRIVING ON AN ATMOSPHERE OF NO ILLUSIONS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y.)   (af)  
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With enduring films like ``Days of Wine and
Roses,'' ``The Manchurian Candidate,'' ``Birdman of Alcatraz,''
``Seven Days in May'' and ``The Fixer'' to his credit, John
Frankenheimer was one of the foremost directors of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   But he stumbled under the weight of personal problems and bad
choices, and, starting in the '70s, his career went awry. For
filmmakers and actors who have made wrong decisions, few places are
as cruel as Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a town with a short memory: It grinds up people and
throws them away,'' Frankenheimer said recently in an interview,
with a shrug and without a trace of bitterness. ``I've had a good
career. One film works and another film doesn't. And then you go
through a period where a bunch of films don't work. So what you
have to do is put that behind you and suck in your gut and say,
`OK, now what can I do?' ''
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 68, with few illusions, Frankenheimer is seeking
to complete &UR;  &LR; a comeback this fall with a large-scale
action-thriller, ``Ronin,'' which opens on Sept. 25.
</P>
<P>
   The film centers on post-Cold War mercenaries (played by, among
others, Robert De Niro, Stellan Skarsgard, Jean Reno and Natascha
McElhone) who are assembled in France to hunt down _ amid betrayals
and some extraordinary car chases _ a mysterious suitcase.
</P>
<P>
   The film was written by J.S. Zeik and David Mamet (under the
pseudonym Richard Weisz). Ronin was the name given to a former
samurai in feudal Japan who was forced to work as a bandit or hired
sword.
</P>
<P>
   How was the match made between Frankenheimer and ``Ronin''?
Lindsay Doran, president of United Artists, the division of MGM
that made the film, explained that Frankenheimer was in her office
last year discussing another project shortly after the screenplay
for ``Ronin'' arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Wait a minute, here's a guy sitting on the couch,
who wants to make a movie with us, and there's this screenplay that
was born to be directed by him, so why don't we put them together?'
'' said Ms. Doran.
</P>
<P>
   She recalled seeing Frankenheimer discuss his film ``The Fixer''
when she was a college student in the '60s. ``I'm a big fan of
his,'' Ms. Doran said. ``I loved his movies, and I'm a supporter of
the idea of hiring people who have practically been forgotten.
There are an awful lot of filmmakers who stop getting hired when
they're 60 or 55 or even 50. People say, `Isn't there some new hot
guy we can get?' So hiring John was very appealing to me and all of
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankenheimer said the script for ``Ronin'' reminded him of
action films of the '60s and '70s, films with fleshed-out plots and
little of the high-tech wizardry that stamps most big-budget movies
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been attracted to material that deals with
characters who aren't what they seem to be _ whether it's
`Manchurian Candidate' or some of the work I've done on television
or the novels of John le Carre or Len Deighton or Richard Condon,''
said Frankenheimer. ``What appealed to me too was that it was an
intelligent suspense thriller. At heart it's a film that questions
our ethics and the meaning of honor and what it means to `do one's
job.'''
</P>
<P>
   There was another reason he did the film. ``Let's not leave out
the fact that most of it takes place in Paris,'' said
Frankenheimer.
</P>
<P>
   He talked about the film in the airy living room of his home on
a quiet, canyon street in Beverly Hills. A tall, rangy figure,
Frankenheimer has a craggy face and eager, surprisingly open style
that give him the appearance of an aging tennis pro.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronin,'' which cost about $60 million, is a risk for him as
well as for financially ailing MGM. Frankenheimer has come back to
studio movies relatively slowly. He was given an extraordinary
boost in recent years when he returned to television, where he
began in the 1950s, to make award-winning movies like ``Against the
Wall,'' ``The Burning Season,'' ``Andersonville'' and ``George
Wallace.''
</P>
<P>
   His lone return to theatrical movies in the last few years was
with ``The Island of Dr. Moreau'' (1996), a bizarre and much
ridiculed film that includes one of Marlon Brando's weirdest
performances.
</P>
<P>
   Frankenheimer was brought to the project after the original
director was fired by New Line Cinema. ``It was a mess when
Frankenheimer came on,'' said one former New Line executive who
spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``They had stopped production,
and what he did was salvage the film and make it releasable.''
(Asked about ``Dr. Moreau,'' Frankenheimer was uncharacteristically
terse. ``It was a dreadful experience,'' he said. ``I don't want to
go into it.'')
</P>
<P>
   What is surprising about Frankenheimer is not simply his candor
about himself but also the no-nonsense way in which he looks at his
career. ``Directing is a very difficult business _ and few survive
it,'' he said. ``The nature of the beast is that any time you make
a movie that costs a certain amount of money and doesn't make any
money or loses money for a studio, your stock as a buyable
commodity drops, whether it's your fault or whether it isn't. I
mean, unless you're in the top 1{ percent you're not going to be
offered all the great things.''
</P>
<P>
   He hopes that his next film for United Artists will be ``The
Good Shepherd,'' a drama about the CIA, written by Eric Roth, who
won an Academy Award for his adaptation of ``Forrest Gump.''
</P>
<P>
   Sipping a glass of water, with bare feet resting against a low
table, Frankenheimer elaborated: ``If `Ronin' doesn't perform, you
know as well as I do that there are suddenly going to be all kinds
of problems with `The Good Shepherd.' It's that kind of business.''
He paused. ``If you're coming off a big hit or a couple of big
hits, you're going to get offered a lot more material than if your
film opened and closed in a weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued quietly: ``So many people have other choices. They
can write or act or can do something else. I've never been that
type of person. My career has been up and down and down and up. To
me life is a very simple choice: This is the only thing I've ever
been good at.''
</P>
<P>
   For years Frankenheimer's career was decidedly up. He was raised
in New York City and Long Island, N.Y., the son of a stockbroker.
``I come from a half-Irish, half German-Jewish background, a very
volatile mix,'' he said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   During the Korean War, while he was in the Air Force making
training films, Frankenheimer decided that he wanted to be a
director. Soon afterward, he was hired as an assistant director at
CBS-TV in New York, where he worked on weather and news broadcasts
as well as series like ``Person to Person,'' ``You Are There'' and
``See It Now.''
</P>
<P>
   This quickly led to assignments directing 152 live television
dramas between 1954 and 1960 _ an average of one every two weeks _
for ``Playhouse 90'' and other anthology series. He made his
feature-film directorial debut in 1956 with ``The Young Stranger.''
What followed was an extraordinary array of intimate psychological
portraits (``Days of Wine and Roses'' and ``The Manchurian
Candidate'') and stylish action dramas (``The Train'' and ``Grand
Prix'').
</P>
<P>
   But his life was eventually engulfed by personal difficulties,
including alcoholism. ``I had a drinking problem,'' he said
quietly. ``It took a toll on me. And the state of mind you're in
when you have a problem like that, even when you're not drunk, is
the most dangerous time. Because you make decisions that are not
totally in your best interest _ about your life, about your career
choices and everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 18 years ago he stopped drinking. ``I said, `I can't go
on like this' _ I figured I'd better do something about it because
otherwise I was going to die,'' recalled Frankenheimer, who has
been married for 37 years to the actress Evans Evans, who appeared
in the original Broadway production of William Inge's ``Dark at the
Top of the Stairs'' and films like ``Bonnie and Clyde.'' They have
two daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding his torment early on was the assassination in 1968
of Robert F. Kennedy. He and Kennedy had developed a close
friendship, and Frankenheimer had spent a good part of that year
traveling with the presidential candidate on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, on the last day of his life, Kennedy was staying at
Frankenheimer's home in Malibu. Frankenheimer drove Kennedy to the
Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles to celebrate his triumph in the
California primary. It was there that Kennedy was killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted me up there on the podium with him,'' said
Frankenheimer, ``but I told him that this wasn't the kind of image
he wanted _ a movie director beside him on the night of the
primary.''
</P>
<P>
   Even now, those memories are raw and difficult for
Frankenheimer. ``It was a terrible night, a terrible time,'' he
said haltingly. ``What I went through is nothing compared to what
his family went through, but it was a terrible time.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to date a moment when things started to turn, it
was after that night. I went through sheer hell. I went to Europe,
and I just lost interest. I got burned out. I was really left very
disillusioned and went through a period of deep depression. It took
a long time to get it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankenheimer lived in France for about five years, taking
cooking classes as an escape. Eventually he directed some films,
notably ``The Iceman Cometh'' (1973), with Lee Marvin, Fredric
March, Robert Ryan and Jeff Bridges, and ``Black Sunday'' (1977),
with Bruce Dern.
</P>
<P>
   But the years that followed saw a general downturn in his work,
with such forgettable movies as ``Prophecy'' in 1979 and ``The
Challenge'' in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   He said that one of his favorite films, ``The Gypsy Moths''
(1969), with Burt Lancaster, Deborah Kerr and Gene Hackman, about
skydivers in Kansas, failed because new management at MGM wanted to
discredit the previous management and gave it no publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Another favorite of his, ``The Horsemen'' (1971), an
action-adventure film with Omar Sharif and Jack Palance, was, he
said, dumped by Columbia Pictures because various top executives
were in conflict with one another. ``I refuse to accept that a
director's work is measured by commercial success because that
would make a lot of bad directors geniuses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Movie offers dwindled in the 1980s. Frankenheimer said that this
was ``a time of rebuilding and kind of re-establishing myself.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, he won an Emmy for his direction of HBO's searing
prison drama ``Against the Wall,'' &UR;  &LR; about the bloody 1971 riot at
the Attica Correctional Facility in upstate New York. The next year
he won an Emmy for his direction of ``The Burning Season'' for HBO.
A third Emmy followed in 1996 for his direction of
``Andersonville,'' a miniseries for TNT. This run of success led
Ms. Doran and her colleagues at United Artists to offer him
``Ronin.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie's international cast responded warmly to
Frankenheimer. ``He is like a young director _ he seems 30 years
old,'' said Reno, a French star who is probably best known here as
the most interesting actor in ``Godzilla.'' ``He's very fast, he
doesn't fish about or hesitate, he makes decisions quickly and
knows exactly what he wants. At the same time he listens to actors
and technicians. He's confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Ms. McElhone, who most recently played opposite Jim
Carrey in ``The Truman Show,'' said: ``John is very upfront, very
on the nose. He's obviously a proud guy and self-assured, but
there's another side to him which is so refreshing. He's not
threatened by actors; he's not ego-based. He's quite happy to let
other people contribute and let your ideas be part of the film.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Doran said that Frankenheimer's recent feature-film and
cable-television work is defined by one quality. ``The word that
keeps coming up for John's work is `professionalism,''' she said.
``This guy's been doing it a long time. There's an assured quality
to his storytelling that's undeniable.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Frankenheimer, he looks at his career _ and his future _
with surprising contentment. He has endured pain and failure, he
said. But who hasn't? ``I've worked all these years,'' he said,
``which is, after all, the name of the game.''

EXPECTED BUYER OF MARLINS WITHDRAWS BID  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By CHARLIE NOBLES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The Florida Marlins' president, Don Smiley, long favored
by the team owner H. Wayne Huizenga to be his successor, withdrew
his bid to buy the team Wednesday. That clears the way for John
Henry _ a South Floridian and minority owner of the Yankees _ to
possibly buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Henry made two recent assurances to Huizenga that Smiley could
not make, Smiley said at a news conference at Pro Player Stadium.
Henry promised not to move the team for at least 12 years, and he
said he would guarantee financing for a new stadium if public money
were not available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wayne has told me very recently, `If you want to get a deal
done, we'll get a deal done,''' Smiley said. ``But I just didn't
think it was fair, and nor did he, that as long as this offer is
there, to stand in the way of giving it its best chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither did Smiley want to put together a patchwork deal, as he
called it, that would be perceived as a ``buddy deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry, whose hedge funds business, John W. Henry and Co., based
in Boca Raton, manages about $2 billion in assets, spent much of
Wednesday in negotiations with Huizenga's representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, when asked if he would be the next owner of the
Marlins, Henry said, ``All signs point to it.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``But, as they say, the devil is in the details.''
</P>
<P>
   One big hint Wednesday that Henry may soon own the team is that
the Marlins, who this season became baseball's most penurious team,
secured General Manager Dave Dombrowski with a five-year extension.
Dombrowski, whose current $700,000-a-year contract would have
expired this year, had been considered the front-runner to become
the Los Angeles Dodgers' general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Smiley called Henry _ who would have to give up his 1 percent
ownership of the Yankees _ a very astute businessman, a baseball
fan, honorable and soft-spoken. ``Baseball needs energetic, smart,
baseball-fan owners _ people who are in touch with the fans,''
Smiley said.

STARR FILED MOTION TO DELIVER REPORT IN JULY

 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Quietly one day in July, Kenneth Starr, the
Whitewater independent counsel, filed a motion with a three-judge
panel here seeking permission to send secret grand jury material to
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the motion was ``In re: Madison Guaranty Savings &AMP;
Loan Association,'' the Arkansas bank related to the failed
Whitewater land deal that was Starr's first investigative mission
more than four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But his sealed July 2 motion sought permission to turn over to
the House of Representatives grand jury testimony and other
evidence of Starr's last investigation: into President Clinton's
liaison with Monica Lewinsky and allegations that he attempted to
cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   Five days later, the three judge panel granted Starr's office
the authority to turn over that material to the House, which Starr
elected to do Wednesday in dramatic fashion when his lawyers
dropped 36 boxes of evidence on Congress' doorstep with only 15
minutes' warning.
</P>
<P>
   Several lawyers who know Starr said Wednesday that they were
extremely surprised that he sought the judges' permission in early
July, two weeks before he subpoenaed the president and six weeks
before Clinton testified before the grand jury. The motion makes it
clear that Starr was planning an impeachment report even before
Clinton was heard by grand jurors.
</P>
<P>
   But the lawyers said that they were not surprised that Starr had
sought the judges' permission, even though there is no provision in
the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 that mandates such a motion.
However, a rule of Federal Criminal Procedure, 6 (e), requires
prosecutors to keep all matters occurring before a grand jury
confidential.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be just like Ken to get a clarification from a court
on this point,'' said Barbara Olson, a Washington lawyer who has
been one of Starr's most visible and outspoken defenders. ``He
didn't necessarily need the permission, but he got it anyway. He's
that meticulous and careful.''
</P>
<P>
   So meticulous, in fact, that he has not dismissed the grand jury
impaneled in January to investigate the Lewinsky matter, which is
scheduled to meet again on Thursday. And a spokesman for Starr said
the criminal inquiry would continue.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress were clearly surprised by the timing of the
report. One possible explanation for the earlier than anticipated
delivery was that Starr wanted to forestall a legal challenge by
David Kendall, the president's lawyer, who on Monday asked Starr
for an advance copy of the report.
</P>
<P>
   Several allies of Clinton said Wednesday night that Kendall was
planning a legal challenge that could have delayed delivery of a
report for days or even weeks, and that Starr may have wanted to
head off such a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The horse is out of the barn now,'' one Clinton administration
official said.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, lawmakers were stunned that Starr did not even
return their phone call, which was placed early Wednesday afternoon
by several staff members of the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Bennett, a Starr deputy, refused to tell them anything
about a report, and said Starr would be back in touch.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Abbe Lowell, the minority counsel to the House
Judiciary Committee, got a frenzied phone call from someone in
Starr's office, saying, ``It's on its way. Where should we go? What
door should we go to? Here are our tag numbers so we can get in.''
Lowell said he couldn't believe it.
</P>
<P>
   Several lawyers close to the office said Wednesday night that it
was clear that Starr decided to go directly by the letter of the
law, passed by Congress in 1978, that established an independent
counsel. And that law, the Ethics in Government Act, says nothing
about an advance-warning phone call to the Speaker of the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The independent counsel statute itself specifically provides
that independent counsel shall advise the House of Representatives
_ House of Representatives _ if we receive substantial and credible
information of impeachable offenses,'' said Charles Bakaly, the
spokesman for Starr's office, at a press conference on Capitol
Hill. ``So we felt that it was _ concurring with that statute that
we had an obligation, independent counsel did, to provide that
information directly to the speaker as well as to the Democratic
leader, and that is what we did today.''
</P>
<P>
   That communication came shortly after 3 p.m. in the form of a
letter sent by Starr to House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Minority
Leader Richard Gephardt. But even Starr's letter said nothing about
the boxes' contents, which were immediately placed in a locked
vault in an office building several blocks from the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Starr did have something to say about the
conditions that needed to be met before lawmakers could make public
the evidence. ``The contents of the referral may not be publicly
disclosed unless and until authorized by the House of
Representatives,'' Starr wrote in the letter to Gingrich and
Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   And he offered several rather ominous words of advice. ``Many of
the supporting materials contain information of a personal nature
that I respectfully urge the House to treat as confidential,''
Starr said.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, no one except lawyers in Starr's office knew
for certain what the report said.
</P>
<P>
   And lawyers inside Starr's office refused to discuss its
contents. At their press conference outside the Capitol, Bakaly and
the deputy independent counsel, Robert Bittman, repeatedly declined
to answer such questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an historic day,'' an exasperated reporter said. ``Can
either of you, Mr. Bittman in particular, comment on the historic
day that this is? Your particular feelings about the delivery of
this report?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Bittman said.

U.N. KEEPS SANCTIONS ON IRAQ, CITING BALKING OF MONITORS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The Security Council voted unanimously
Wednesday to deprive Iraq of any hope of having sanctions lifted
until President Saddam Hussein resumes cooperation with U.N. arms
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hopeful that the Iraqi leadership will get the message
that a unanimous council has sent them,'' said Peter Burleigh, the
deputy American representative. ``There's an urgent need for Iraq
to change its policies and come back into compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution also calls for a complete review of Iraqi
relations with the United Nations, but not until the arms
inspectors of the U.N. Special Commission and the International
Atomic Energy Agency are allowed to resume their work in full.
</P>
<P>
   The council asked Secretary General Kofi Annan, who proposed the
review, to the consternation of some members, to explain what he
had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's envoy to the United Nations, Nizar Hamdoon, said Iraq
would now consider any and all options in response to the freezing
of future sanctions reviews. Officials expect some kind of Iraqi
reaction within days, but are hesitant to predict what it might be.
</P>
<P>
   China, the last holdout for some kind of olive branch to
Baghdad, joined other nations Wednesday afternoon in accepting an
unambiguous condemnation of Iraq and calling on Baghdad to rescind
without conditions an Aug. 5 Iraqi decision to stop all intrusive
arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that the Iraqi side should comprehensively implement
the relevant resolutions,'' China's deputy representative, Shen
Guofeng, said before the vote, adding that the council should then
respond promptly and positively to Iraqi compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Russia also backed the resolution that suspends all future
sanctions reviews, leaving Iraq without defenders. ``This
resolution clearly speaks for itself,'' Sergey Lavrov, the Russian
representative, said after the vote. ``I believe it clearly states
that the council doesn't like the current situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution, which falls in a classification that allows the
use of force, is seen by diplomats as a first step in building new
pressure on Iraq after a year of council splits on the issue and
diplomatic skirmishes in which the Iraqis gained substantial
footing in the United Nations through new links to the secretary
general's office.
</P>
<P>
   But sympathy for Iraq seems to be in abeyance there also, since
Hussein has effectively thrown the agreement made with Annan in
February back in the secretary general's face.
</P>
<P>
   Annan said Wednesday that he met Iraq's Vice President, Taha
Yassin Ramadan, in Durban, South Africa, last week at the summit
meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement and told him it was essential
that Iraq reverse its noncooperation policy if it ever wanted to
see the end of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Jeremy Greenstock, Britain's representative, expressed the
slight annoyance that persists among diplomats over the need even
to consider yet another review of Iraqi relations with the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq has had plenty of opportunities to look at the road map
and follow it,'' Greenstock said. ``But we have given them another
opportunity. If Iraq does not take this opportunity, it is left in
the doldrums under sanctions, excommunicated from the international
community, because it is determined not to cooperate. That would be
most unfortunate.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Over the last year, Iraq has also demanded a series of
independent technical reviews of its weapons programs in the hope
of circumventing U.N. inspectors. But the Iraqis were found wanting
in every area by the independent experts.
</P>
<P>
   Before sanctions imposed after the August 1990 invasion of
Kuwait can be lifted, U.N. inspectors must be satisfied that all
Iraq's biological, chemical and nuclear weapons and the means to
make them have been destroyed, along with prohibited missile
systems not needed for Iraqi defense.
</P>
<P>
   A senior White House official said after Wednesday's vote: ``The
resolution sends a crystal-clear message that the Security Council
will remain united and that the sanctions will stay on in
perpetuity until Saddam lets Unscom do its job.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the United States would pursue the idea of further
military action if Hussein fails to relent, the official said, ``We
have not ruled out any options, but we will keep our hands on his
pocketbook until he changes his mind.
</P>
<P>
   The official added, ``We'll deny him what he wants most: his
money.''

AFTER MOVES BY RENO, OFFICIALS SEE NEW PROSECUTOR AS INEVITABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After two years in which Attorney General Janet
Reno resisted demands for the appointment of an independent
prosecutor to investigate how the Democrats financed President
Clinton's re-election campaign, Reno has started three separate
inquiries, each of which could lead to an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden activity _ opening three cases in less than two weeks
_ has significantly shifted the opinions of some prosecutors and
investigators who once thought an independent counsel was out of
the question. Many now believe such a step is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   The latest of the new 90-day inquiries, announced Tuesday,
centers on whether Clinton and White House aides coordinated a
Democratic advertising campaign, for what are known as issue
advertisements, in an effort to violate federal spending limits
that he agreed to when he accepted taxpayer financing for his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The second inquiry focuses on Vice President Al Gore's
statements about his telephone fund-raising calls from the White
House. The third looks at possible perjury by former deputy White
House chief of staff Harold M. Ickes concerning his dealings with
the Teamsters union.
</P>
<P>
   In the estimate of the government officials, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, Reno is unlikely to seek an independent
prosecutor in the case of Gore and is likely to ask for an
appointment in the case of Ickes. The case of Clinton and the issue
advertisements, they said, is too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans want Reno to refer all three matters to an
independent prosecutor, a step that would give them what they have
long demanded: a broad, open-ended criminal investigation of how
the Democrats financed Clinton's re-election. But that seems
unlikely.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, Reno remains one of the administration's most
indecipherable Cabinet officers, whose aides are never certain
about her views on an issue until she reaches a decision. And in
recent weeks, her decisions have seemed unusually difficult to
assess, as she reopened inquiries once thought to be closed. In
these cases, aides said, she learned of new evidence of the sort
that she had earlier said would cause her to reconsider her past
decisions to refer the cases to an outside prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Within law-enforcement circles, Reno is thought most likely to
seek an independent prosecutor in Ickes' case primarily because of
the highly specific nature of the accusation against him: lying to
the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee about his efforts on
behalf of the teamsters at a time when the White House was trying
to enlist the union's political support.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said her decision to open an inquiry was based on a March
report by the Senate panel. The committee unearthed highly specific
information contradicting statements made by Ickes in a deposition.
He had testified then that he had been unaware of White House
efforts to intervene in a labor dispute at Diamond Walnut Growers,
a large food cooperative in California.
</P>
<P>
   But the panel's report said internal teamsters' memorandums
obtained by investigators showed that Ickes had asked former U.S.
Trade Representative Mickey Kantor to intervene with a senior
Diamond Walnut executive to settle the dispute. Moreover, an aide
to Ickes told the committee that Ickes had asked her to follow up
his conversation with Kantor to determine whether he had made
contact.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has shown little reluctance to refer cases to independent
prosecutors when there was concrete evidence suggesting that an
administration official lied. For example, she chose that option in
the case of whether former Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros had
lied to FBI agents about payments he made to a former mistress and
in the case of whether Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt had made
false statements in congressional testimony about the agency's
rejection of an Indian gambling casino license.

   The investigation into Gore's fund-raising calls was reopened
after the White House last month produced a 1995 memorandum that
suggested that Gore may have known that his solicitations were
improper, although he has denied it. But officials said the
memorandum, although suggestive, is not conclusive and seems
unlikely by itself to provide the basis for a prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   On the most recent inquiry, into the commercials, Reno initiated
the review based on the preliminary findings of a Federal Election
Commission audit in August. It concluded that the Democratic
National Committee evaded federal spending limits by funneling
millions of dollars to state parties for advertisements that were
thinly veiled messages on behalf of the Clinton-Gore campaign, and
that they should have been counted under the President's spending
limit.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry is centered on whether Clinton coordinated an
illegal effort to violate spending limits he agreed to when he
accepted taxpayer financing for his campaign. But some officials
expect that it will be difficult to define a specific prosecutable
offense. And, they added, Clinton's campaign obtained extensive
legal advice on the advertisements, a defense that could undercut
any effort to bring a prosecution.

CELEBRITIES' INTEREST IN FALL TV SHOWS

</P>
<P>
   I'm interested to see that show on UPN about a black man working
in Lincoln's White House, ``The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer.''
I'm anxious to see how they deal with the subject of slavery in a
comedy. The Alex Haley miniseries ``Mama Flora's Family'' also is
interesting to me.
</P>
<P>
   I watch ``60 Minutes.'' I watch the Discovery Channel. I can't
wait for the next season of ``Sunday Morning.'' It's my favorite
show.
</P>
<P>
   I can't get into these youth half-hour comedies about characters
exploring their new-found sexual freedom. They turn me off. Black
comedies are pretty much the same, so sophomoric.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot of copycatting. When something works, rather than
using it as a high-water mark to get something as creative but
different, they come in and say, ``Give us something just like
that.'' Last season we had rip-offs of ``Friends.'' This season
we're going to get rip-offs of ``Ally McBeal'' and ``Dawson's
Creek.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm anxious to see what hangs around. I'm betting that no more
than 10 percent to 15 percent will. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SARAH JESSICA PARKER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Actress &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Encore! Encore!'' I think Nathan Lane is marvelous, so
anything he is in should have loads and loads of potential.
</P>
<P>
   The show I love and can't wait for its new season is ``Everybody
Loves Raymond.'' I remember seeing the very first episode, and I
just liked Ray Romano immensely. I don't know if ``Frontline'' has
a new season, but I always look forward to it. It's my favorite
show.
</P>
<P>
   Because of work and traveling so much, it's hard to become
involved in a show if you know you are not going to be committed to
it. The only show I was that way about was Garry Shandling's show.
I was devastated when I heard it was going off the air.
</P>
<P>
   I love the Food Network. I'm an enormous fan of David
Rosengarten. I enjoy the whimsy of the ``Two Fat Ladies,'' and I've
tried lots of ``Molto Mario's'' recipes. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MARTA KAUFFMAN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Producer &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'm looking forward to ``Trinity,'' the new John Wells show. I
think John is enormously talented and the cast is terrific.
</P>
<P>
   I'm very excited about Animal Planet. I watch ``Emergency Vet''
and cry; it's like ``E.R.'' with animals. And I love ``A Breed
Apart'' and the series that follows a bunch of vets in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   I watch stuff with my kids like ``Rugrats,'' ``Hey Arnold!'' and
``Nick News'' with Linda Ellerbee. ``Nick News'' is intelligent and
forward-thinking and starts incredible discussions in my family.
</P>
<P>
   I think studios and networks tend to be a little misguided in
thinking there is a formula for success and that the previous
season's hit is the formula. For something to work, a little bit of
luck is involved, a little bit of talent, an enormous amount of
hard work, and the rest is just a crapshoot. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ARMISTEAD MAUPIN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Writer and producer &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The one show I'm most curious about is ``Encore! Encore!'' It's
produced by David Lee, who produced ``Frasier,'' which to my mind
is the most sophisticated work on television. If ``Encore!'' is
half as witty as ``Frasier,'' it will be the second best thing on
television.
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be serious energy behind it, and I doubt Nathan
Lane would have committed himself to it unless it was halfway
decent.
</P>
<P>
   I'm a shameless television addict, so I watch whatever is on.
But that doesn't mean I like it. I'll watch a good old film for the
sixth time on AMC rather than a bad new network drama.
</P>
<P>
   I think Thomas Gibson and Jenna Elfman have terrific charisma on
``Dharma and Greg,'' but I wish the material could be sharpened
more than it is. I don't watch cop shows or hospital dramas. ``Ally
McBeal'' is fingernails on the blackboard for me. I'm one of those
people who is driven nuts by her whining.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not remotely excited about the new television season. In
fact, I can't remember when I was. I get excited about individual
shows after they have proven themselves to me. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JOAN RIVERS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Host &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I hope Roseanne is wonderful this year. I'm looking forward to
her show. She's very outspoken. She can say what she wants.
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see what happens with Whoopi Goldberg
on ``Hollywood Squares.'' Whoopi is very funny but she's slow-funny
and ``Hollywood Squares'' is fast-funny. It's also important to see
who will be the other squares.
</P>
<P>
   I think Nathan Lane's show has a chance because he is so
brilliant and it should be a well-written show. It all comes back
to the written word. Is it funny? You must have a good script. And
a good time slot.
</P>
<P>
   I really watch the top of the dial. I watch PBS, A&AMP;E and on up.
On Sunday nights, I wait for ``Masterpiece Theater.'' I watch
Turner Classic Movies, the Histor Channel. I adore ``Law and
Order''; it nods to your intelligence. I'm sure something new is
going to blossom, as it always does. But I'm not blocking out
nights.

TV SPORTS COLUMN: ALSO KING OF RATINGS AND T-SHIRTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also BBO-MCQWIRE-SEASON) 
(JT) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark McGwire's home run quest has been very good to Fox and
ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's coverage of McGwire's 62d home run Tuesday night yielded a
12.9 Nielsen rating, drawing 43.1 million viewers and more than
doubling last season's average rating for the night's prime-time
programming. It was the highest rated regular-season baseball game
since an ABC telecast 16 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Fox pre-empted the highly promoted season premiere of ``King of
the Hill'' and the debut of a new series, ``Costello,'' to show the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, it was a great night,'' said David Hill, president of
Fox Television and Fox Sports. ``It was one of the most heroic
sports moments I've ever seen. I've never seen the equal of
McGwire's humility and overall niceness.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire hit his historic home run at 9:18 p.m. Eastern time and
Fox's rating peaked at a 15.5 from 9 to 9:30 p.m. In St. Louis, Fox
generated a 43.4 rating. In Chicago, the Fox broadcast was blacked
out but WGN-TV posted a 20.6 rating.
</P>
<P>
   For ESPN, televising Monday's game when McGwire hit his 61st
home run generated a 9.5 rating, the highest ever for baseball on
the cable network and 27 percent higher than Cal Ripken's 2,131st
consecutive game three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The interest in McGwire was underlined by the instant delivery
of McGwire artifacts to the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown,
N.Y., Wednesday. Arriving with a police escort were the bat McGwire
used to hit home runs 56 through 62, the No. 62 ball, his jersey,
cleats, cap and batting gloves and even the batboy uniform worn by
his son, Matthew.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Fox said Wednesday it would not pre-empt prime time
again if Sammy Sosa is about to break the 61-home run barrier, or
if McGwire goes on another tear. ``It's time to move on,'' Hill
said. But ESPN is considering adding Cubs or Cardinals games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We add games on the last weekend for pennant races,'' Mike
Soltys, an ESPN spokesman, said. ``Now we'll have to think about
adding games for the home run race.'' He added, ``Sixty-one is
still a significant number.''
</P>
<P>
   The televised celebration Tuesday night highlighted an agreement
that McGwire, Major League Baseball and the players union made last
week for Starter to manufacture what the parties described as the
official locker room T-shirt for the 62d home run.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire got a fee and will get future royalties for the Starter
T-shirt, which bears his likeness and 62 baseballs on it. Although
his Cardinal teammates wore the T-shirt onto the field after the
game, McGwire kept his team jersey on until he returned to the
locker room and did not wear the T-shirt during his post-game news
conference. He did wear a commemorative 62d home run cap, made by
New Era, during the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have the best-laid plans, but sometimes they don't
work out,'' Robin Wexler, a Starter spokeswoman, said. ``While we
would have loved for him to wear it at the press conference, he
wore it in the locker room as he agreed to.''
</P>
<P>
   Starter had 150,000 advance retail orders for the T-shirts, and
50,000 more came in Wednesday, Wexler said. Pro Player and Nutmeg
have produced McGwire and Sosa T-shirts during the season but do
not have agreements with either player. Combined with new No. 62
home run shirts, Pro Player has 2 million McGwire shirts in the
market or on order, Peter Seligman, a company spokesman, said.
</P>
<P>
   A raft of major agreements will surely come McGwire's way after
the season and force him to confront how much he wants to
commercialize himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's established so much credibility I don't think people will
begrudge him for the deals he'll make,'' said Frank Vuono,
president of Integrated Sports International. ``And his people are
asking for seven figures.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Bob Williams, president of Burns Sports, which
matches athletes to advertisers, McGwire has agreements with Grand
Slam cereal, Franklin batting gloves and Rawlings bats. He has also
appeared in a commercial for McDonald's in St. Louis and an
infomercial for the Juiceman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be hard for him to turn away from the deals he'll be
offered during the off season,'' Williams said.

that  &UR; Bill &LR;   &UR; Clinton &LR;  would need some bucking up on August 17, the
day he testified to  &UR; Kenneth Starr &LR; , sent co-workers a friendly
note that the boss' birthday was only two days away. As quoted in

   A bronze bust of  &UR; Elizabeth Terwilliger &LR; , Marin County's
renowned naturalist and educator, by sculptor  &UR; Glen Miller &LR;  will be
unveiled Sunday at a picnic in Olompali State Historic Park,
celebrating her 89th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   The bust was commissioned about five years ago by  &UR; Kent &LR; 
 &UR; Diehl &LR; , who wanted it installed in the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed
Marin County Civic Center. By Diehl's account, county supervisors
didn't want it because Frank Lloyd Wright didn't like statues. Mark
Schatz, of the Frank Lloyd Wright Civic Center Conservancy, which
makes sure that even the newspaper racks and courtroom television
monitors fit into the Wright plan, says he's never heard of the
Terwilliger bronze. He said he would give it fair consideration if
the matter were brought up formally.

Terwilliger belongs outside ... ``perhaps in a wetlands area.''

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Sept. 10:
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, tourists and civil servants pause when they
sense history in the making. The television cameras showed scores
of them watching as two black vans arrived on Capitol Hill with 36
boxes containing Kenneth Starr's report to Congress. The delivery
may have signaled the beginning of a race. Can Bill Clinton
apologize rapidly and completely enough to prevent the contents of
those boxes from destroying his presidency?
</P>
<P>
   We will not know the answer for a while, but there is no
mistaking that this week has brought a more somber legal and
constitutional vocabulary into play. By delivering his 500-page
report with supporting documents, Starr, the independent counsel,
was serving official notice that he believed he had found
``substantial and credible information of impeachable offenses.''
House Speaker Newt Gingrich made the correct initial response,
ordering that the documents be locked away until the House of
Representatives adopts rules for how the Judiciary Committee will
handle the information.
</P>
<P>
   The abrupt delivery of the Starr report caught congressional
Democrats and the White House off guard. It also speeded up the
political clock for Clinton. His initial response, delivered
through his lawyer David Kendall, was terse: ``There is no basis
for impeachment.'' The president delivered the same message in an
emotional meeting with skittish House Democrats on Wednesday
morning. But before they and the Senate critics within Clinton's
own party decide whether they will stand with him in an impeachment
fight, they want answers to less legalistic questions. Are there
other bombshells out there? As Senator Bob Graham of Florida put
it, does Clinton finally understand that ``he's got a serious
problem with the American people''?
</P>
<P>
   They also want to know if Clinton can get beyond what another
Democrat, Sen. Robert Byrd, called the ``delay and counterattack''
strategy. In Florida Wednesday, Clinton tried to show he could by
admitting to Democratic donors that ``I let this country down.''
Yet there was an odd language in his description of visiting a
school. He spoke of wanting ``to be able to conduct my life and my
presidency so that all the parents of the country could feel
good.'' The language seemed to suggest that at some deep level the
president fails to acknowledge how much of the story of his life
and this presidency has been written in indelible ink.
</P>
<P>
   So, at the end of one of the worst days that any modern
president has experienced, here is Bill Clinton's situation. He
must produce a mammoth political effort to secure the forgiveness
that he could have had with ease if he had told the truth on the
day seven months ago when he wagged his finger at the American
people and denied having sex ``with that woman, Miss Lewinsky.''
Moreover, only a handful of people, including Clinton, know whether
those 36 boxes actually contain information that would wreck his
already fragile standing with the public and his party. At this
portentous moment, this president who has had so much trouble with
the truth did produce one sentence of indisputable veracity. ``I
have no one to blame but myself for my self-inflicted wounds.''

A LITTLE DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILY FUN  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 13)
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   My brave spirit!'' is what Prospero calls the sprite Ariel in
``The Tempest.'' Not to get too Shakespearean, but a brave spirit
is precisely the quality that gives a television show some promise.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, few television characters share Prospero's eloquence.
In the ABC sitcom ``The Hughleys,'' a black man who has just moved
his family into a white neighborhood wakes from a nap and embraces
his children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids, you're black!'' he shouts with joyful relief, for in his
dream they had turned lily-white.
</P>
<P>
   In a different suburb, in the Fox animated series ``Family
Guy,'' Stewie is the baby of the family, yet even in his highchair
he has a mission: eliminate his mom and conquer the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the deuce are you staring at?'' the baby snaps after
sending a blow dart that narrowly misses his mother. Stewie speaks
with the sinister accent of a British B-movie villain, which is odd
because the rest of the family includes a beer-swilling
all-American dad and two teen-age siblings.
</P>
<P>
   What can it mean that the two most enticing new series of the
season are about families in distress? You can construct theories
that are high-blown (the shows reflect the instability of the
American family) or commonplace (a plot needs some conflict).
</P>
<P>
   A more likely explanation is that these series display brave
satirical wit, which might explode the snuggly confines of the
domestic sitcom, that most pedestrian and widespread of television
genres.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Hughleys'' (ABC, beginning Sept. 22) the stand-up
comedian D.L. Hughley plays the father, who fears that the move
will cause his family to lose its black identity.
</P>
<P>
   The show comes with much power behind the screen. One of its
executive producers is Chris Rock, whose own ``Chris Rock Show''
(Fridays on HBO) is the funniest and most daring comic talk show on
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hughleys'' shares that show's emphasis on the details of
black culture and the ability to speak to a multiracial audience.
The sitcom ultimately concerns the confusion that upward mobility
creates for people of any race, a great American comic theme.
</P>
<P>
   Though ``Family Guy'' is scheduled as a midseason replacement,
predictions for the year (on every network) are so bleak that many
people expect midseason to arrive any minute. This animated series
takes on the implicit challenge of ``The Simpsons'' and ``King of
the Hill,'' offering an even more outrageously satirical family.
</P>
<P>
   The show includes plenty of comic possibilities, especially in
the television parodies within the series; this family is,
naturally, glued to the set. The big question is whether ``The
Hughleys'' and ``Family Guy'' will sustain a sharp edge; if not,
they'll become just two more sitcoms about bumbling dads.
</P>
<P>
   There are few sure things in any television season, but
``Homicide: Life on the Street'' (NBC on Fridays; new season begins
Sept. 25) has made what seems like a flawless move, adding
Giancarlo Esposito to the cast. He is not a replacement for Andre
Braugher, who has left the series.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he plays a new character, Mike Giardello, an FBI agent
assigned to work alongside Baltimore's homicide unit. Mike is also
_ here comes that family feeling _ the estranged son of Lt. Al
Giardello (Yaphet Kotto).
</P>
<P>
   Esposito, perhaps best known for his work in Spike Lee films
(including ``Do the Right Thing'') is an actor whose every move
suggests intelligence and intensity, a perfect fit for this smart,
endlessly gripping series.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, uncertainty can be alluring, especially when the
outcome is likely to be either a triumph or a joke. One of the
season's most intriguing, unpredictable made-for-television movies
borrows Shakespeare's ``Tempest'' (his story, not his language) and
moves it to Mississippi during the Civil War, that ultimate family
feud. Peter Fonda plays Gideon Prosper, a plantation owner with
magical powers, courtesy of elaborate special effects.
</P>
<P>
   Fonda is an incentive to watch ``The Tempest'' (NBC, date to be
announced). It is less promising that Caliban has been turned into
a villain called Gator Man. Still, something so fearlessly offbeat
is rare in the timid land of television, which so often fulfills
another of Prospero's predictions: ``Thou art inclined to sleep.''

EDITORIAL: RACES FOR CONGRESS IN NEW YORK CITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Sept. 10:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One of the reasons New York City has an
undistinguished congressional delegation is that in most cases,
Democratic incumbents enjoy virtual automatic lifetime tenure. Most
of these one-party districts are not even holding perfunctory
primaries, let alone serious races, on Sept. 15. Fortunately, there
are a few exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Ninth District (Brooklyn and Queens, including Forest Hills,
Middle Village, the Rockaways, Sheepshead Bay, Howard Beach, Coney
Island and part of Park Slope): Four Democrats are vying to replace
Rep. Charles Schumer. Daniel Feldman, 49, a respected member of the
Assembly, has spent nine terms working hard on issues of criminal
justice and corrections. Another Assembly member, 33-year-old
Melinda Katz, has only been in office four years, but she has
distinguished herself as an advocate of health and women's issues
and for her constituent services. Councilman Anthony Weiner, a
34-year-old former aide to Schumer, seems just as intense and
ambitious as his old boss did at that age. The fourth candidate,
City Councilman Noach Dear, 44, is well known on the national
political scene for his skill in amassing political donations. But
within the Council, Dear is regarded as too beholden to special
interests, and his record does not inspire confidence that he would
continue Schumer's progressive policies.
</P>
<P>
   New York's congressional delegation is desperately in need of
fresh energy, and on that count Weiner and Ms. Katz are the
strongest candidates. Of the two, Ms. Katz gets better grades for
her ability to win converts among her colleagues and articulate the
issues. Whoever represents the Ninth District is going to have to
work with Republicans and conservative Democrats in order to get
much accomplished, and in that atmosphere we believe Melinda Katz
would be the best choice.
</P>
<P>
   10th District (Brooklyn, including Bedford Stuyvesant, East New
York, Canarsie, Carroll Gardens, Boerum Hill and part of Brooklyn
Heights): In the competition for most mediocre member of the New
York delegation, Rep. Edolphus Towns is always a contender. In his
16 years in Congress, Towns has distinguished himself mainly for
his large record of missed votes and his subservience to special
interests, notably the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Ford, a 35-year-old Harvard-educated lawyer with a good
record of community service in Brooklyn, is running a vigorous
uphill battle against Towns in the Democratic primary. A second
insurgent, Ed Diamondstone, has good intentions but is not a
serious factor. Ford is the most promising candidate ever to
challenge Towns. He has a good understanding of the district's
needs, a commitment to public service and a sensible agenda
stressing education and community development. He gets our
enthusiastic endorsement.

NASD TO SET UP NETWORK TO REPORT DATA ON BONDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Seeking to shine a light into a long-dark corner of
the financial markets, Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities
and Exchange Commission, announced measures Wednesday to give
investors more information about the prices and trading of
corporate bonds.
</P>
<P>
   At the commission's request, the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Wall Street's self-regulatory organization,
will set up an electronic network to report and distribute prices
immediately of trades in corporate bonds and preferred stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Campbell, an executive vice president of Nasdaq, the
electronic stock market operated by the National Association of
Securities Dealers, said a similar electronic system to report bond
trading data will be developed over the next 12 to 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Levitt said, the association will ``create a
surveillance program to better detect fraud'' in the corporate bond
market using a database of the price and trade information.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the SEC may have found some trouble. Levitt said
Wednesday that the commission was investigating possible insider
trading among participants in the market for high-yield corporate
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt said that investigation, which is in its preliminary
stages, grew out of the same review of the debt market that
resulted in the SEC's initiative on bond prices. He declined to
comment on the possible targets of the investigation, but the
admission that an inquiry exists was itself unusual for any SEC
official.
</P>
<P>
   Recent volatility in the financial markets, which Levitt said
had affected the prices of bonds as well as stocks, ``underscores
the need for greater price transparency in the market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For securities markets, transparency is the extent to which
timely data and prices are visible and understandable to all
participants, institutional and individual,'' Levitt said.
``Investors have a right to know the prices at which bonds are
being bought and sold.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike stocks, which are generally traded through a centralized
market like the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, most bonds are
traded directly between two investors or through an intermediary,
usually a securities firm. While several small electronic services
offer a forum for investors to trade bonds directly, and some
corporate bonds are traded on the New York or American exchanges,
for most bonds there is no mechanism for reporting prices to
investors who are not involved in a particular transaction.
</P>
<P>
   That is true despite the fact that the dollar value of daily
bond trading exceeds the value of stock trading by several times.
Trading in all bond markets _ for corporate, government and
municipal bonds _ totals roughly $350 billion a day, Levitt said.
Combined daily trading volume on the New York and American stock
exchanges and Nasdaq totals about $40 billion a day.
</P>
<P>
   The result, for smaller institutional investors and for
individuals, who have less ability to accurately judge the current
market value of a company's bonds, is likely to be higher prices
and a less efficient market.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three major categories of bonds, less information is
available about the prices of corporate bonds than any other.
Levitt said that a review of the bond markets by the SEC found that
high-quality pricing information was generally available for
government bonds, and that, because of steps taken by regulators
over the last few years, more information is available about
municipal bond prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we believe that in the area of corporate bonds, price
transparency is simply not up to par,'' Levitt said. ``The
corporate debt market remains one of the last major markets in the
United States not to have some kind of electronic price disclosure
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the electronic specifications of the bond price system are
put together by the National Association of Securities Dealers, the
SEC will allow public comment on the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said that unlike the Nasdaq stock market the bond price
system would not be an electronic transaction system. Rather, it
will report prices only.
</P>
<P>
   The Bond Market Association, an industry trade group, said in a
statement that it supported Levitt's goal of providing investors in
bonds with meaningful price information, but believed that those
efforts should be ``specifically targeted to the over-the-counter
bond markets, as opposed to simply relying on an equity model.''
</P>
<P>
   Levitt said the lack of information about corporate bond trading
could result, during periods of market turmoil, in a lack of
liquidity in the market. On Aug. 31, for example, when the Dow
Jones industrial average fell 512 points, ``there was virtually no
buyer interest in the corporate bond market,'' particularly among
high-yield, or junk, bonds, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This, in turn, had a significant impact on a well-defined
segment of mutual funds _ those which invest in the high-yield
market,'' Levitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Getting information on bond prices is only one aspect of the
SEC's interest in corporate bond trading, Levitt said. In its
survey of the state of the bond market, the commission also
uncovered ``anecdotal evidence of the possible misuse of inside
information in the high-yield market,'' he said.

STARR'S REPORT DELIVERED IN DRAMATIC TRANSFER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rarely does the nation see such a visible shift of
power.
</P>
<P>
   But there, Wednesday afternoon, in front of the marble steps
leading to the House of Representatives, Capitol police transferred
Kenneth Starr's report on President Clinton from vans of the
special counsel to those belonging to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, the taped, white file boxes were shifted _ and
Clinton's fate may have moved along with them.
</P>
<P>
   A few legislators gathered with tourists, reporters and
congressional aides _ separated from the dramatic scene by a cordon
of police officers, some patrolling on bicycles.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's decision to turn his vast conclusions and files over to
the House had come so quickly that some people on the East Front of
the Capitol were not certain what they were witnessing.
</P>
<P>
   The two copies of the report, each buttressed by 18 boxes of
additional materials, represented Starr's eight months of inquiry
into Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The materials were turned over to House Sergeant at Arms Wilson
Livingood. He ordered the van-to-van transfer and their
quarter-mile trip to the nearby Ford House Annex for safe-keeping.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich said the reports and files will
remain locked up until at least Friday. The House is scheduled to
vote then on authorizing the Judiciary Committee to lead an inquiry
into possible impeachment proceedings against the president. The
resolution also will set the rules for how the documents will be
handled, including their release to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us will have access to (the report) until we pass a
resolution about how to deal with this,'' said Gingrich, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Partisan affiliation shaded members' views of the public
transfer of the documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think much about it,'' said Rep. Eddie Bernice
Johnson, D-Dallas, when told that Starr had finally submitted his
long-awaited report.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does seem to like the attention, doesn't he,'' Johnson said
of Starr, contending that the independent counsel could have
delivered the report in a less public manner.
</P>
<P>
   As she spoke, TV cameramen screamed at people to get out of
their line of sight so that they could continue filming the
transfer of the boxes.
</P>
<P>
   The vans pulled up in front of the Capitol about 4 p.m. EDT,
just as Republican leaders were ending an outdoor news conference
nearby, outlining their legislative agenda for the fall session.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said Starr did not ``call ahead'' to say the report was
coming, despite an appeal from Republican and Democratic lawmakers
that he give them some idea when to expect it.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich and House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt met late
Wednesday night to try to figure out, as one Republican aide put
it, ``what we're supposed to do now.''
</P>
<P>
   The public delivery of the Starr documents was unprecedented
because Congress has no procedures in place for handling a special
prosecutor's report on possible impeachable offenses committed by a
president. The Watergate investigations and hearings, for example,
were conducted by a joint committee of the House and Senate before
Congress passed legislation establishing an independent counsel
statute.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all new territory for us,'' said one Democratic
leadership aide. ``We're having to kind of make it up as we go
along.''

<P>
   I'm most anxious to see Terrence Malick's film ``The Thin Red
Line.'' He's only made a few films, and I've seen each one at least
three times. And I believe that James Jones book is the best war
novel ever written.
</P>
<P>
   I don't worry that he hasn't made a film in so many years: A
master never loses his touch. His work is very human, very powerful
and always stirs the emotions. He likes a certain perfection where
his shots are concerned, and he gets marvelous actors.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly I'm looking forward to Kubrick's ``Eyes Wide Shut.''
Taking his time is Kubrick's trademark, too. An artist always feels
he can do better, so I hold nothing against either of these men who
work so little and take so long with each piece. There's no hype
with them, no buzz necessary. They go with their current; they
manage to touch the eye, the mind and the heart. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PAUL SCHRADER
</P>
<P>
   Director &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I've been hearing a great deal of buzz about ``Shakespeare in
Love,'' which stars Gwyneth Paltrow and Joseph Fiennes, Ralph's
brother. I have seen about 15 minutes of it and I can honestly say
the buzz was right. It's a tricky thing, costume comedy, but if you
get the tone right, it sails.
</P>
<P>
   And since this is written by Tom Stoppard, it seems to sail.
He's funny and he's brilliant. It's also directed by John Madden,
who did ``Mrs. Brown,'' so he knows his way around this territory
too. I like Gwyneth Paltrow. I like her mother and I like her, the
intelligent gamin types.
</P>
<P>
   But I don't usually look forward to a film based on its stars,
it's usually a mixture of the director and the underlying material.
Carl Franklin is a very interesting director with a terrific eye,
and so I'm interested to see what he does with ``One True Thing,''
which might seem an odd choice for him, but maybe it's a smart one.
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone else, I'm curious about ``The Thin Red Line,'' but
I'm afraid they might be setting Terry Malick up for a dreadful
fall. He's been off the map for a long time, and now that Spielberg
has made his Oscar winner, there's Terry sitting with a $60 million
World War II film. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ERIC STOLTZ
</P>
<P>
   Actor &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'm anxiously awaiting ``Existenz,'' the new David Cronenberg
film with Jennifer Jason Leigh. He's always so wonderfully
disturbing. I haven't heard a word about this one, but even when
his films don't work, they work.
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, there's ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' Stanley Kubrick's
film. All the talk about delays doesn't worry me; it just makes me
hungrier. I mean it doesn't make me hate the cook. Mostly I'm
interested because of Kubrick, but I also think Tom Cruise is
generally underestimated as an actor because he's so popular.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's ``Instinct'' starring Anthony Hopkins, Cuba Gooding
and a lot of apes. I mean, how great does that sound? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WENDY FINERMAN
</P>
<P>
   Producer &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'm looking forward to ``You've Got Mail,'' both to see how they
remake a great movie with a new format, and to see Tom Hanks and
Meg Ryan together again. With Nora Ephron's wit, you just know
you'll enjoy the ride. It just sounds like the ultimate great date
movie.
</P>
<P>
   I'm also looking forward to ``A Bug's Life'' and ``Antz.'' I am
terrified of bugs, and I feel these movies may help me get over it.
But mostly I'm looking forward to the rerelease of ``The Wizard of
Oz.'' I never saw it on the big screen, and my three children
certainly haven't. The idea of taking them on a holiday afternoon
to see it the way it was supposed to be seen seems like heaven. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MARK CANTON
</P>
<P>
   Producer &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   First, I'm looking forward to ``Prince of Egypt.'' It's going to
be a unique effort, and Jeffrey Katzenberg is so talented with
animation, and I know it's been a real passionate project for him.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's ``You've Got Mail,'' which should be one of the
great male weepies _ along the lines of movies like ``Rocky,''
``Terms of Endearment,'' ``As Good As It Gets.'' If you can get men
to be emotional, you've got everybody.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly I'm looking forward to the surprises, and there are
always those, the movies about which there is no buzz but will
sneak up on us and capture us. I mean, who knew that we were
looking forward to the new movie from the Farrelly brothers,
``There's Something About Mary,'' until we saw it? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   GEORGE STEVENS JR.
</P>
<P>
   Producer &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As I look at what's ahead, I feel most excited about ``A Civil
Action.'' It's a compelling story, stars two of the best actors
around _ John Travolta and Robert Duvall _ and has a
writer-director of great promise (Steve Zaillian). I've admired him
since ``Looking for Bobby Fischer'' and have wondered why he hasn't
done more. I look for a great movie rather than great box office
necessarily, simply because nobody knows anything for sure in this
business, and I admit it.
</P>
<P>
   The little-lawyer-that-could aspect of the story interests me,
and because a lot of what I've done has been fact-based, I feel
that when that kind of project works, they can be great. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JOHN WATERS
</P>
<P>
   Director &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'm going to be very cinematically incorrect here because the
movie I'm looking most forward to is Woody Allen's ``Celebrity.''
My guilty pleasure has always been art films, and they've become
extinct, almost like a slur in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   But Woody's films are as close as we get to art films, and I've
loved them all. I don't even know who's in this one except for
Leonardo DiCaprio, but he always gets a great ensemble. I don't
even know if Woody's in it, but it doesn't matter because, he'll be
the star anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, most of us pay to get pre-awareness for our
films; he pays people to make sure there's no pre-awareness. I know
some knock him about the younger-girl thing, but I always say humor
comes from perversity and anger, and that doesn't bother me. It's
no time to get moral. I loved Fassbinder's films, too, and I
believe all his boyfriends committed suicide! &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ERIC ROTH
</P>
<P>
   Screenwriter &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'm looking forward to what some of the screenwriters have to
say, particularly the great Bo Goldman, who's done ``Meet Joe
Black.'' He's the pre-eminent screenwriter _ in my mind as good as
it gets. He has the most varied and intelligent credits, from
``Cuckoo's Nest'' to ``Shoot the Moon,'' the best divorce movie
ever made, to ``Scent of a Woman,'' to the great satire ``Melvin
and Howard.''
</P>
<P>
   He rarely makes mistakes, and he manages to maintain a
distinctive American voice. And he manages to stay timely. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TINA ANDREWS
</P>
<P>
   Screenwriter &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For me, there is first of all ``Beloved.'' I would have loved to
have adapted it myself and, frankly, I don't know how that one got
past me. As a black female screenwriter I seem to get them all now.
Still, having not done it does not diminish my excitement about it.
</P>
<P>
   Besides wanting it to be good, I want it to do well at the box
office, because I want to see more middle-class black stories done,
and I want our black actresses to get good material to sink their
teeth into.
</P>
<P>
   I'm excited about all the African-American oriented films coming
out, and I call this our Dark Autumn. We've got ``Stella'' and Maya
Angelou's directing debut with ``Down in the Delta'' and a couple
more. If these films do well, Hollywood will make more of them, and
I won't have to be talking about a Black Fall. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ROBERT LOGGIA
</P>
<P>
   Actor &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'm kind of an old-fashioned guy in Hollywood: I root for my
friends and people I've worked with. So I'm looking forward to the
Tom Hanks-Meg Ryan movie. I feel I have a vested interest in Tom,
having danced on a piano with him in ``Big.''
</P>
<P>
   And Meg played my daughter in some film a long time ago whose
name I can't even remember. I just feel actors are a fraternity, a
community, and we should support each other.
</P>
<P>
   I'm going to need all the support I can get, I think, for one of
my next films, ``Live Virgin.'' It's a takeoff on a French farce
with me and Bob Hoskins playing competing porno fathers. It sounds
sleazy, but if they bring it off, it may actually work.
</P>
<P>
   It's real black comedy, which is the toughest thing to do. It
worked so well in one movie I was in, ``Prizzi's Honor,'' where
you're laughing one minute and getting killed the next. But it's
always a crapshoot. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   MARK STEVEN JOHNSON
</P>
<P>
   Writer-Director &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'm looking forward to ``Beloved'' because I'm a huge Jonathan
Demme fan, and it has great buzz about being a shoo-in at Academy
time. That kind of buzz in Hollywood is not always accurate, but I
listen anyway. I'm probably most curious about ``A Civil Action''
because it's written and directed by Steve Zaillian, whom I
consider a role model.
</P>
<P>
   I'm now making my first outing as a director, as well as a
writer, and I've always watched his career closely since he's done
the same. His first movie was small, but I'm anxious to see what he
does with a big budget and big stars.
</P>
<P>
   He takes a lot of time between and during his projects, but
having worn both hats now, I understand the need for as much time
and reflection as possible _ not always easy in this business but
worth striving for. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JON LANDAU
</P>
<P>
   Producer and artist manager &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first movie I'm very interested in is ``Goodbye, Love''
directed by Roland Joffe and starring Patricia Arquette. I've
admired Joffe since ``The Killing Fields,'' and I like relationship
stories.
</P>
<P>
   I'm also excited about ``In Dreams'' because it's directed by
Neil Jordan and stars Annette Bening, who I think is just a
phenomenal actress. Then there's ``Ronin,'' starring De Niro and
directed by John Frankenheimer. It's a thriller, and when you look
back over Frankenheimer's work, it seems a perfect fit. I never
worry about a director like him losing touch because I feel once
you have it, you have it.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I'm curious about Robin Williams' movie, ``What Dreams
May Come,'' about a man who dies and then tries to reconnect. It
shows the promise that ``Ghost'' delivered on. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RENNY HARLIN
</P>
<P>
   Director &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   First of all I'm looking forward to the 40th-anniversary release
of ``Touch of Evil'' because I've never seen it on a big screen.
Orson Welles is every filmmaker's idol, and it was shot in such a
unique way.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's ``Rounders,'' a script I read and loved, with Matt
Damon and Ed Norton playing professional low-class card sharks. The
script was really smart, and it just sounds delicious to me. It's
the type of movie I'd love to do, but no one lets me, thinking I
can do only big spectaculars. I like anything that makes me feel
strong emotion, whether it is fear or sorrow or romance. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   STEVE TISCH
</P>
<P>
   Producer &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I think first of ``Enemy of the State'' because it has three
great actors in what seems a pretty original idea. Besides Gene
Hackman and Jon Voight, it seems a real departure for Will Smith,
heading here into more serious territory.
</P>
<P>
   The other one for me is ``What Dreams May Come'' because it was
not made in the traditional studio system and feels more like an
independent film. The themes are provocative, dealing with the
afterlife and worlds other than ours.
</P>
<P>
   I admire Robin Williams because he keeps pushing the envelope _
sort of like Jim Carrey did with ``The Truman Show'' _ when he
could just relax and do what his audience expects of him.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are some real independents. I'm looking forward to
the new film by Todd Solondz, ``Happiness,'' and ``Apt Pupil'' by
Brian Singer, who did ``Usual Suspects.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally I'm real interested in the sophomore effort, what
people do for their second film, so that would include those two
and Neil Labute with ``Your Friends and Neighbors.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DAVID HOBERMAN
</P>
<P>
   Producer &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I tend to be captivated by directors first, and I hear that
``Simon Birch'' is great, and I'm certainly excited about
``Beloved'' because it's Jonathan Demme. Then there's ``Election''
with Matthew Broderick, directed by Alexander Payne, who did a good
short film and is coming up the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   He's a smart and clever writer-director, and I'm interested in
what he has to say. I'm looking forward to ``The Deep End of the
Ocean'' because I was a fan of the book.
</P>
<P>
   And I'm interested in seeing all of the animated movies because
I think it's going to be an important time in that field. New
things are being done and the level of competition has accelerated.
It just feels like a turning point in animated American films,
going against the classic stories and reaching for a more grown-up
audience. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JOHN DAVIS
</P>
<P>
   Producer &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because I have kids, I'm looking forward to ``The Rugrats
Movie.'' And I'm excited about ``Holy Man'' because Eddie Murphy
always makes me laugh. I worked with Ed Zwick on ``Courage Under
Fire'' so I'm curious to see ``Against All Enemies,'' which he's
directed, with Denzel Washington.
</P>
<P>
   I guess I'm excited about ``Babe in the City,'' though I sort of
feel like I just did that one myself. I see any movie that costs a
lot of money so I'm looking forward to ``Mighty Joe Young.'' I just
like to try to see where the money went. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TREY PARKER
</P>
<P>
   Director &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No one would believe this but my favorite kind of movie is
historical dramas. I very rarely go to see comedies; I just never
really saw the point. In fact, I rarely go to movie theaters. I
don't like being around a lot of people I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   I grew up in this mountain town and had to drive two hours to
Denver to see a movie, so I was like real happy when VCRs came
along. Even when people say to me, you probably want to see this
projected on a big screen, I'm still thinking of the video.
</P>
<P>
   There is one movie with Wesley Snipes coming out, and I always
like his movies, even on the big screen. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   STEVE HEREK
</P>
<P>
   Director &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The one for me is ``Meet Joe Black.'' I saw the original,
``Death Takes a Holiday,'' when I was a kid and it always stayed
with me. It's filled with ideas like all the implications of what
happens if nobody died. And I'm a big fan of Brad Pitt.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not necessarily a remake fan. For example, I'm not looking
forward to the new ``Psycho'' because my feeling is like, why? But
``Death Takes a Holiday'' was, I believe, a not so big or known
movie so this is a whole different thing, and the science fiction
aspects of it are so timely today. I'm looking forward to getting
that eerie feeling recaptured.

ADVERTISING: MADISON AVENUE IS SALIVATING FOR SOSA AND MCGWIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Duplication warning: also moving in `s' category) 
(JT) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The race to cash in on Mark McGwire's 62nd home run
is already under way as marketers as disparate as Walt Disney Co.
and a maker of baseball caps called Twins Enterprises scramble to
celebrate his record.
</P>
<P>
   But in an unusual counterpoint to the overwhelming American
commercial culture, that contest has not been as frenetic as other
recent efforts to capitalize on athletic achievement. That is
because McGwire and Sammy Sosa, the other player vying for the
single-season home run mark, have been devoting far less time to
the marketing aspects of the chase than to the actual task facing
them.
</P>
<P>
   That unconventional concentration on heroics rather than
hyperbole has helped build national attention and affection for
both men and also delayed what would have been a typically frantic
round of deal-making during the season.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, ``Madison Avenue is salivating,'' said Roberto
Muller, president and chief executive of Muller Sports Group, a
marketing company in New York. ``They're dying for Mark and
Sammy.''
</P>
<P>
   Muller predicted that if McGwire and Sosa were to collaborate on
ads, ``they will be bigger than Michael and Larry,'' referring to
the basketball stars Michael Jordan and Larry Bird, who cooperated
on campaigns for advertisers like McDonald's Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates are that McGwire may land $2 million worth of deals
and Sosa $1 million. Those figures could change, though, if Sosa
were to hit more homers than McGwire during the season. Sports
marketing experts said they thought the flap over McGwire's use of
a controversial drug would not affect his appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Both McGwire, who plays for the St. Louis Cardinals, and Sosa,
who plays for the Chicago Cubs, have agents who have been
emphasizing long-term agreements with a short list of blue-chip
advertisers. They are following in the cleated footprints left in
1995 by Cal Ripken Jr. and his marketing agent, Ira Rainess, when
Ripken set the record for consecutive baseball games played.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that McGwire and Sosa haven't allowed themselves to
be overcommercialized during this stretch has probably encouraged
fans _ and consumers _ to take a liking to both players,'' said
Sean Brenner, editor of Team Marketing Report, a newsletter in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   In an example of the somewhat old-fashioned attitudes that
McGwire and Sosa have displayed, the agency that creates the ``milk
mustache'' campaign found that McGwire was reluctant to discuss
appearing in an ad to run the day after he broke the 37-year-old
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the ad all done and, quite frankly, we think he'd be
terrific,'' said Jay Schulberg, chief creative officer at Bozell
Worldwide in New York, the unit of True North Communications that
creates the ads for the National Fluid Milk Processor Promotion
Board. ``But he said he didn't want to agree to do a celebratory ad
until he actually did it.''
</P>
<P>
   So no ad has run, Schulberg said, adding that discussions with
McGwire _ and Sosa _ continue.
</P>
<P>
   Those attitudes have influenced those who would take advantage
of the home run hoopla to sell products.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Post-Dispatch and its agency, Core in St. Louis,
have held off running ads tied to McGwire because of his reluctance
to play for pay during the race. So the first McGwire-related ads,
posters and radio commercial from the newspaper, owned by Pulitzer
Publishing Co., are only now running.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has set the tone,'' said Marc Kempter, managing partner at
Core. ``And I think Madison Avenue would be wise to follow, because
our industry needs to learn a lesson about not exploiting a
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From the newspaper's standpoint,'' he added, ``there's a fine
line between homerism and journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   The Post-Dispatch campaign carries headlines like ``Superstars
are put on pedestals. Heroes bring us up with them.'' Core had
5,000 posters printed to give away to newspaper customers, Kempter
said.
</P>
<P>
   The first national advertiser to try making hay with the record
was Disney, which at 12:55 a.m. Eastern time Wednesday _ less than
four hours after McGwire hit home run No. 62 _ ran a commercial on
ESPN showing McGwire, with his son, Matt, making the traditional
post-big-game promise that they would be ``going to Disney World.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That amazes even me,'' said Rod Madden, a spokesman for Walt
Disney World in Orlando, Fla., referring to the turnaround time for
the spot, short even by Disney standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had anticipated that McGwire would be able to achieve his
goal,'' Madden said, so Disney video crews followed McGwire to
compile footage and partially preproduce the commercial. Footage
from the home run and the celebration was added to complete the
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, it is the 25th commercial in the ``What are you
going to do next?'' campaign _ and McGwire wears No. 25.
</P>
<P>
   There were also newspaper ads Wednesday saluting McGwire from
the Russell Corp athletic division, the official baseball uniform
supplier, as well as Major League Baseball and its Major League
Baseball Properties division, which licenses merchandise now being
sent to stores bearing likenesses of McGwire or the number ``62.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those licensees, the trade newspaper DNR reported, are the
Starter Corporation, for T-shirts, and Twins Enterprises, for
baseball caps. Some items received free national exposure Tuesday
night as McGwire and his teammates wore them during post-game
events.
</P>
<P>
   Another advertiser getting a free plug was the Chevrolet
division of General Motors Corp., which benefited from extensive
coverage of McGwire's victory ride around Busch Stadium in a red
1962 Corvette given to him by the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   It was serendipity, not shrewdness, however, because Chevrolet
was not involved with the gift, said Annmarie Gorecki, a
spokeswoman in Detroit, adding that ``the Cardinals worked through
a Chevrolet dealer to locate the vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   Some national advertisers have featured McGwire or Sosa or both
in ads before the record was broken. One was Mastercard
International, a Major League Baseball sponsor, which began running
a commercial on Friday showing the two players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus was on breaking the record,'' said Larry Flanagan,
vice president for advertising at Mastercard in Purchase, ``and we
will continue following the story.'' The Mastercard agency is
McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising in New York, part of
McCann-Erickson World Group unit of Interpublic Group of Cos.
</P>
<P>
   There ``will be additional creative'' in a spot for the
post-season, Flanagan said, adding that computer users can enter an
online sweepstakes at www.mastercard.com/62 to guess the ultimate
home run king and his final tally.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire is also glimpsed in a commercial for the Budweiser beer
brand sold by the Anheuser-Busch Companies and is one of several
``power hitters'' pictured on boxes of Wheaties cereal, sold by
General Mills Inc.
</P>
<P>
   He will also appear on the cover of more than 500,000 copies of
Sports Illustrated that the Time Inc. unit of Time Warner Inc. will
ship to newsstands. The issue represents the first ``extra'' of the
magazine, said Rick McCabe, a spokesman for Sports Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   At this rate, there may even be an endorsement career for Steve
Trachsel, the Cubs pitcher who served up the record homer to
McGwire.

SOSA, 0-FOR-3, REMAINS AT 58  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL DEDMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The Baseball Hall of Fame has a display case with Mark
McGwire's bat, ball, jersey, spikes, everything but his socks and
underwear. The question is, will Sammy Sosa still have his uniform
when the season ends?
</P>
<P>
   Sosa remained at 58 home runs Wednesday, with 16 games
remaining. He went 0 for 3, during the Cubs' 4-2 victory over the
Pirates at Wrigley Field; the triumph snapped a three-game losing
streak. Jason Schmidt (11-11) walked Sosa in his first at-bat and
Mark Grace followed with a a three-run homer, his 15th of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Following Sosa's every move now is a representative of the
National Baseball Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll stay with Sosa until he hits 62, at least,'' said John
Ralph, director of communications and programming for the Hall. The
Hall has Sosa's bat from his 57th homer, which set a Cubs record
and passed Hack Wilson's old National League record, and a bat from
his record-setting June. Sosa was welcomed with a standing ovation
by 34,857 fans at Wrigley. ``McGwire who?'' said one sign. Sosa
walked, grounded out twice and struck out swinging.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa said he wasn't trying too hard. ``I'll just take what
happens,'' he said. ``I'm not thinking about it. I know if I don't
think about it and have the same fun I've been having all season,
it'll happen for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, the Cubs learned that the rookie right-hander
Kerry Wood would miss his second consecutive start on Friday with a
sore elbow. Wood, 13-6 with a 3.40 earned run average, threw five
pitches on the side Wednesday when he complained of soreness. Wood
had a tired arm in early August but did not skip a start. Mark
Clark (8-13) allowed five hits in seven and two-thirds innings.

ECONOMIC SCENE: WHAT'S AN AILING ECONOMY TO DO? 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund, having bailed out Thailand,
Indonesia, South Korea and Russia over the last 15 months, is
nearly out of money, and Congress is not yet rushing to its
defense. But its job is far from complete.
</P>
<P>
   The financial crisis that it tried to snuff out in Asia has
spread to Latin America and beyond. Investors are still dumping
won, pesos and rubles in a grab for dwindling reserves of dollars,
driving up the costs of imports for consumers and depriving
economies of desperately needed foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
   With the IMF partly sidelined for now, the debate on how to stop
the financial carnage rages at two levels _ what beleaguered
countries should do for themselves and what the international
community should do for them. One important step the industrialized
powers could take _ debt relief _ has worked in the past. But
otherwise, the outlines of a solution remain murky as economists
find that many of the old panaceas do not work.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to insulate an economy from investor flight is to
cut excessive borrowing. But as Argentina, Mexico and other Latin
American countries are learning, responsible monetary and fiscal
policies are no sure-fire inoculation. Their problems are primarily
external, starting with a steep drop in Asian demand for oil and
other exports that has siphoned off dollars and scared away
skittish investors.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond balancing its books, a country must decide how to link
its economy to the outside world. A fixed exchange rate sets the
value of a currency in terms of the dollar, providing day-to-day
stability for exporters and investors.
</P>
<P>
   Some conservatives, like Jack Kemp, the Republican vice
presidential candidate in 1996, preach fixed rates in part because
such a regime requires a government to protect the value of its
currency by maintaining a strict monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate fixed-rate regime is a currency board _ a policy
rarely mentioned before the crisis in Asia _ by which a country
restricts the issue of its currency to the amount of foreign
reserves it accumulates. Argentina prints a peso only when it
acquires, through export sales or capital inflows, an additional
American dollar. Its currency board thereby assures investors that
Argentina holds enough dollars to redeem pesos whenever they decide
to cash in their investments.
</P>
<P>
   By linking a currency to the dollar, a currency board in effect
transfers control over a nation's money supply to Washington. It is
a reflection of desperate times that some respected economists,
like Rudiger Dornbush of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
have embraced the idea of a currency board for Russia. What would
have seemed like an unthinkable infringement of a superpower's
sovereignty a year ago now seems like Russia's possible salvation.
</P>
<P>
   But fixed-rate systems bottle up tremendous economic forces that
eventually spew forth with potentially cataclysmic consequences.
Consider Hong Kong. As its Asian trading partners collapsed, its
exports plummeted, cutting deeply into its dollar reserves. The
shriveling reserves have raised doubts about Hong Kong's ability to
maintain the value of its currency by putting up as many American
dollars as it takes to soak up as much of its currency that
investors might want to sell.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Hong Kong _ like Russia, Brazil, Venezuela and other
countries defending their exchange rates _ facing unappetizing
options: abandoning its currency peg _ almost certainly exposing
itself to huge devaluations _ or luring dollars by raising domestic
interest rates to levels that risk curbing economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   The danger, as the Nobel laureate Milton Friedman warned more
than 30 years ago, is that fixed exchange rates provide only an
illusion of stability. Rate changes are infrequent, but when they
do come, they can hit with the force of a bomb. Floating rates,
which he says are preferable, are adjusted continuously in response
to internal and external shocks, diminishing the danger of a
calamitous day of reckoning.
</P>
<P>
   Another decision that each country must make is how open it
wishes to be to foreign capital. Here again, the intellectual
climate is changing. Most economists have preached the gospel of
open borders in the belief that capital would migrate to its best
use and that competition from abroad would keep domestic
entrepreneurs honest.
</P>
<P>
   But recent events in Asia and Latin America _ where the whims of
currency traders and short-term investors have tormented seemingly
healthy economies _ have led many economists to embrace another
erstwhile heresy: capital controls, by which governments control
buying and selling of foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
   Jagdish Bhagwati of Columbia University, one of the world's
foremost advocates of free trade, now encourages countries to
consider adopting controls during financial crises. Paul Krugman of
MIT endorsed controls earlier this month, which, at least in his
mind, influenced Malaysia's decision last week to follow his
advice.
</P>
<P>
   Controls are intended to enable a country to loosen its monetary
and fiscal policies when it needs to in order to fight off
recession without fear of setting off a massive flight of dollars,
which can no longer be taken out of the country upon demand. But
Jeffrey Sachs of the Harvard Institute for International
Development warns countries to limit their use to inflows of
short-term investment. If, instead, countries try to block
investors from taking their money out at will, controls may wind up
driving foreign investors away for good.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Running parallel to the debate over domestic policies is a
battle over the role of the IMF. It has assumed responsibility _ in
Mexico in 1995, Asia in 1997 and Russia in 1998 _ for bailing out
countries in financial distress, lending tens of billions of
dollars in exchange for commitments by those countries to tighten
fiscal, monetary, banking and employment policies.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Mexico, intervention worked well. In other cases,
as in Asia and Russia, IMF policies have backfired, at least in the
view of critics. Sachs accuses the IMF of cracking down too hard in
Asia, needlessly fueling investor panic.
</P>
<P>
   C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International
Economics in Washington, concedes that the IMF made serious errors
as the Asia crisis unfolded, though he says that it has largely
corrected its significant miscues since then.
</P>
<P>
   Contradicting many of the IMF's critics in Congress, Bergsten
argues that the world needs a well-financed institution that can
lend money to countries in temporary distress, preventing one
country's ills from needlessly infecting others. He does, however,
call on the fund to better monitor countries before a crisis hits
and to intervene earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs would switch the fund's mission from organizing grandiose
bailout packages to organizing negotiations between debtor nations
and their creditors. His idea is modeled on the U.S. bankruptcy
system, which allows judges to put creditors on hold while a
settlement is reached. Sachs recognizes that the fund would need a
similarly powerful legal lever if it were to play a similar role.
</P>
<P>
   The latest remedy gaining fashion would have the central banks
of the United States, Germany and Japan jointly announce a cut in
interest rates beyond what Japan announced on its own Wednesday.
The idea is to harness the cooperative spirit that, by some
accounts, helped solve the problem of a soaring dollar in the 1980s
and use it to break the pessimistic mood of international
investors. Joint rate cuts would also provide relief to economies
with large dollar-denominated debts.
</P>
<P>
   But while the symbolism of joint international action might turn
investors into optimists, it is easy to exaggerate the likely
effect of a joint rate cut. Interest rates in the industrialized
West are already low, and the United States is loath to drive them
much lower because its economy is, at least for now, growing
briskly. Besides, rate cuts do nothing to cure serious ills, like
Japan's insolvent banks or Russia's corrupt institutions.
</P>
<P>
   But Alan Blinder, an economics professor at Princeton University
and a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, provides a
clever political rationale for a joint rate cut.
</P>
<P>
   If it were combined with an ironclad commitment by Japan to
solve its banking problems _ a necessary step to its recovery and
therefore Asia's _ the joint rate cut would rise above symbolism.
Still, Blinder describes the case for joint rate cuts as
borderline.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, one effective remedy on which most economists
agree. Russia and other besieged countries cannot pay off their
Western loans. Just as debt relief was the key to South America's
recovery in the 1980s, debt relief will have to be part of any
solution to the current plight of Russia and Asia. The sooner it
comes, the sooner a widespread economic rebound can begin. &QL;

ADVERTISING: MADISON AVENUE IS SALIVATING FOR SOSA AND MCGWIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Duplication warning: also moved in `f' category) 
(JT) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The race to cash in on Mark McGwire's 62nd home run
is already under way as marketers as disparate as Walt Disney Co.
and a maker of baseball caps called Twins Enterprises scramble to
celebrate his record.
</P>
<P>
   But in an unusual counterpoint to the overwhelming American
commercial culture, that contest has not been as frenetic as other
recent efforts to capitalize on athletic achievement. That is
because McGwire and Sammy Sosa, the other player vying for the
single-season home run mark, have been devoting far less time to
the marketing aspects of the chase than to the actual task facing
them.
</P>
<P>
   That unconventional concentration on heroics rather than
hyperbole has helped build national attention and affection for
both men and also delayed what would have been a typically frantic
round of deal-making during the season.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, ``Madison Avenue is salivating,'' said Roberto
Muller, president and chief executive of Muller Sports Group, a
marketing company in New York. ``They're dying for Mark and
Sammy.''
</P>
<P>
   Muller predicted that if McGwire and Sosa were to collaborate on
ads, ``they will be bigger than Michael and Larry,'' referring to
the basketball stars Michael Jordan and Larry Bird, who cooperated
on campaigns for advertisers like McDonald's Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates are that McGwire may land $2 million worth of deals
and Sosa $1 million. Those figures could change, though, if Sosa
were to hit more homers than McGwire during the season. Sports
marketing experts said they thought the flap over McGwire's use of
a controversial drug would not affect his appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Both McGwire, who plays for the St. Louis Cardinals, and Sosa,
who plays for the Chicago Cubs, have agents who have been
emphasizing long-term agreements with a short list of blue-chip
advertisers. They are following in the cleated footprints left in
1995 by Cal Ripken Jr. and his marketing agent, Ira Rainess, when
Ripken set the record for consecutive baseball games played.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that McGwire and Sosa haven't allowed themselves to
be overcommercialized during this stretch has probably encouraged
fans _ and consumers _ to take a liking to both players,'' said
Sean Brenner, editor of Team Marketing Report, a newsletter in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   In an example of the somewhat old-fashioned attitudes that
McGwire and Sosa have displayed, the agency that creates the ``milk
mustache'' campaign found that McGwire was reluctant to discuss
appearing in an ad to run the day after he broke the 37-year-old
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the ad all done and, quite frankly, we think he'd be
terrific,'' said Jay Schulberg, chief creative officer at Bozell
Worldwide in New York, the unit of True North Communications that
creates the ads for the National Fluid Milk Processor Promotion
Board. ``But he said he didn't want to agree to do a celebratory ad
until he actually did it.''
</P>
<P>
   So no ad has run, Schulberg said, adding that discussions with
McGwire _ and Sosa _ continue.
</P>
<P>
   Those attitudes have influenced those who would take advantage
of the home run hoopla to sell products.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Post-Dispatch and its agency, Core in St. Louis,
have held off running ads tied to McGwire because of his reluctance
to play for pay during the race. So the first McGwire-related ads,
posters and radio commercial from the newspaper, owned by Pulitzer
Publishing Co., are only now running.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has set the tone,'' said Marc Kempter, managing partner at
Core. ``And I think Madison Avenue would be wise to follow, because
our industry needs to learn a lesson about not exploiting a
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From the newspaper's standpoint,'' he added, ``there's a fine
line between homerism and journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   The Post-Dispatch campaign carries headlines like ``Superstars
are put on pedestals. Heroes bring us up with them.'' Core had
5,000 posters printed to give away to newspaper customers, Kempter
said.
</P>
<P>
   The first national advertiser to try making hay with the record
was Disney, which at 12:55 a.m. Eastern time Wednesday _ less than
four hours after McGwire hit home run No. 62 _ ran a commercial on
ESPN showing McGwire, with his son, Matt, making the traditional
post-big-game promise that they would be ``going to Disney World.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That amazes even me,'' said Rod Madden, a spokesman for Walt
Disney World in Orlando, Fla., referring to the turnaround time for
the spot, short even by Disney standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had anticipated that McGwire would be able to achieve his
goal,'' Madden said, so Disney video crews followed McGwire to
compile footage and partially preproduce the commercial. Footage
from the home run and the celebration was added to complete the
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, it is the 25th commercial in the ``What are you
going to do next?'' campaign _ and McGwire wears No. 25.
</P>
<P>
   There were also newspaper ads Wednesday saluting McGwire from
the Russell Corp athletic division, the official baseball uniform
supplier, as well as Major League Baseball and its Major League
Baseball Properties division, which licenses merchandise now being
sent to stores bearing likenesses of McGwire or the number ``62.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those licensees, the trade newspaper DNR reported, are the
Starter Corporation, for T-shirts, and Twins Enterprises, for
baseball caps. Some items received free national exposure Tuesday
night as McGwire and his teammates wore them during post-game
events.
</P>
<P>
   Another advertiser getting a free plug was the Chevrolet
division of General Motors Corp., which benefited from extensive
coverage of McGwire's victory ride around Busch Stadium in a red
1962 Corvette given to him by the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   It was serendipity, not shrewdness, however, because Chevrolet
was not involved with the gift, said Annmarie Gorecki, a
spokeswoman in Detroit, adding that ``the Cardinals worked through
a Chevrolet dealer to locate the vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   Some national advertisers have featured McGwire or Sosa or both
in ads before the record was broken. One was Mastercard
International, a Major League Baseball sponsor, which began running
a commercial on Friday showing the two players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus was on breaking the record,'' said Larry Flanagan,
vice president for advertising at Mastercard in Purchase, ``and we
will continue following the story.'' The Mastercard agency is
McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising in New York, part of
McCann-Erickson World Group unit of Interpublic Group of Cos.
</P>
<P>
   There ``will be additional creative'' in a spot for the
post-season, Flanagan said, adding that computer users can enter an
online sweepstakes at www.mastercard.com/62 to guess the ultimate
home run king and his final tally.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire is also glimpsed in a commercial for the Budweiser beer
brand sold by the Anheuser-Busch Companies and is one of several
``power hitters'' pictured on boxes of Wheaties cereal, sold by
General Mills Inc.
</P>
<P>
   He will also appear on the cover of more than 500,000 copies of
Sports Illustrated that the Time Inc. unit of Time Warner Inc. will
ship to newsstands. The issue represents the first ``extra'' of the
magazine, said Rick McCabe, a spokesman for Sports Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   At this rate, there may even be an endorsement career for Steve
Trachsel, the Cubs pitcher who served up the record homer to
McGwire.

strode to the podium here last month, he was applauded wildly by
several dozen car dealers, each of whom had paid from $25,000 to
$60,000 to acquire a franchise for the fledgling Eurasia Motor
Corp. of Fort Lauderdale, Fla. For 18 months, the dealers had seen
nothing but pictures of a quickly changing mix of vehicles, but
now, they thought, they were moments away from the real thing. Not
that every Eurasia dealer had waited patiently. ``I think it was a

CLINTON, IN FLORIDA, ISSUES LATEST APOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Continuing an effort to repair his relationship
with the public, President Clinton admitted Wednesday, ``I let my
family down, and I let this country down.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's comments at a Florida fund-raiser were his most
complete expression of regret over his relationship with former
White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky. And White House aides said
the president will continue apologizing, heeding the advice of
fellow Democrats who say that one apology or statement of
contrition may not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing similar advice Wednesday from Democratic
lawmakers, Clinton offered his latest apology, not knowing that a
little more than an hour later, independent counsel Kenneth W.
Starr would send to Congress evidence that could support an
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   As the House begins digesting that report, the president will
have to hope that these apologies will be enough for the public to
forgive him and for Democrats to rally around him and ward off any
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's strategy, which is likely to become a staple of his
public appearances for the foreseeable future, was previewed
Wednesday at a Florida fund-raiser for Democratic gubernatorial
candidate Buddy MacKay.
</P>
<P>
   In unscripted and sometimes rambling remarks, he accepted
responsibility for his actions and acknowledged his human failings,
while reminding the audience of his achievements and his plans for
the future _ in effect, the reason they elected him in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be open with you. I want you to understand these
have been the toughest days of my life. But they may turn out to be
the most valuable for me and my family,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I have no one to blame but myself for my self-inflicted
wounds. But that's not what America is about. And it doesn't take
away from whether we're right or wrong on the issues or what we've
done for the last six years or what this election's about.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also sought to mend his relationship with Democrats,
whose support for him has been crumbling since his Aug. 17
admission that he had lied to the American people for eight mmonths
about his affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done my best to be your friend. But I also let you down,
and I let my family down, and I let this country down,'' Clinton
said at the fund-raiser. ``But I'm trying to make it right. And I'm
determined never to let anything like that happen again,'' he said
to applause and cheers.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I ask you for your understanding, for your forgiveness on
this journey we're on. I hope this will be a time of reconcilation
and healing, and I hope that millions of families all over America
are in a way growing stronger because of this,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Before flying to Florida, Clinton held an emotional, frank, and
at times brutal discussion with House Democratic leaders over
coffee and danish in the Yellow Oval Room in the White House
residence.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt reminded Clinton that
impeachment was becoming an issue when he told the president, ``We
have a constitutional role to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Connecticut Representative Rosa DeLauro told Clinton:
``You've broken the bond of trust with Americans. You need to
repair it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. President,'' New Jersey Representative Robert Menendez
said in a dramatic moment. ``There can be no more surprises.''
</P>
<P>
   After a pause, the president nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he heard loud and clear from the members of this
morning what he needed to do publicly,'' said one senior White
House aide. ``And I think that had something to do with his
comments'' later in the day in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Another Clinton senior adviser said of the meeting: ``I think
the president explained to them his full sense of remorse, the
depth of his remorse and what he's done by his own actions from
beginning to end.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers present said Clinton appeared sincere and was
compelling in his comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we saw was a father, a husband, a leader of our country
who was contrite and who was very sorry for his actions. It was an
emotional meeting,'' said House Democratic Whip David Bonior of
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   He said he believed that Clinton will withstand the scrutiny of
Starr's report and remain in office, and that neither the word
``impeachment'' or ``resignation'' came up.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Clinton visited a Florida school and made
comments about St. Louis Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire that could
just as easily have applied to himself.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that after talking to McGuire Tuesday night when he
broke Roger Maris's record of 61 home runs in a season, ``I got to
thinking about, you know, what's Mark McGwire going to do with the
rest of his life?...
</P>
<P>
   ``How would you feel if Mark McGwire announced, `Well, I've been
working real hard to do this all my life and if it's all the same
to you, I think I'll skip the last 18 games.' Right? Or, `If it's
all the same to you, I think I'll just stand up there and see how
many times I could walk.'
</P>
<P>
   ``You would be puzzled, at least, wouldn't you? Well, that's the
kind of decision we have to make as Americans.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr on
Wednesday sent to Congress a report that prosecutors said contains
``substantial and credible information'' that could constitute
grounds for the impeachment of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The material, including reams of grand jury transcripts and
audio tapes, arrived at the Capitol four years after Starr took on
the investigation of Clinton's role in failed land deals in
Arkansas, and eight months after his inquiry was expanded to
include the sex and coverup scandal involving a White House intern,
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The delivery of two duplicate, sealed 18-box sets of information
caught Congress by surprise, arriving in two vans late in the
afternoon on 15 minutes notice. Just hours earlier House leaders
had convened a rare bipartisan meeting to began setting the
procedures for deciding whether to begin the first impeachment
proceedings against a president since the Watergate inquiry that
led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon in August 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the east front of the Capitol before mobs of reporters,
staring lawmakers and gawking tourists, Charles G. Bakaly III,
Starr's spokesman, said: ``The office has fulfilled its duty under
the law. Responsibility for the information that we have
transmitted today and for any further actions now lies with the
Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to say whether the information sent to Congress
covered any offenses in the earlier Whitewater investigation, or
whether this report dealt only with the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bakaly would not elaborate on the contents of the
500-page report, it contained a 140-page section outlining possible
grounds for impeachment. Starr has been expected to show Congress
whether the president's conduct amounted to the crimes of perjury,
obstruction of justice, and suborning perjury and abuse of his
office.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly said the independent counsel's investigation is
continuing. The grand jury hearing the Lewinsky matter is to meet
again on Thursday, and lawyers familiar with. Starr's plans said it
would continue to pursue additional evidence.
</P>
<P>
   With his presidency in grave peril, Clinton began the day trying
to appease leading Democrats who have urged him repeatedly to
apologize in public to try to stem public disappointment and dismay
at his conduct. Described as sad and somber, Clinton offered
emotional apologies on Wednesday morning to senior House Democrats
for his liaison with Monica Lewinsky and for his denials of the
relationship. Afterward, Rep. David Bonior of Michigan, the House
minority whip, said Clinton ``needed to be out in the country as
difficult as it will be.''
</P>
<P>
   By mid-day, Clinton was in Orlando, Fla., on a fund-raising
trip, where he made a public display of contrition that contrasted
sharply with his defiant television address on Aug. 17. Hours after
testifying to a grand jury three weeks ago, Clinton first
acknowledged the relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, which he had
denied for seven months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let my family down and I let this country down, but I am
trying to make it right,'' Clinton said at a fund-raising lunch.
``I am determined never to let anything like that happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   As the president planned a series of public events this week,
his strategists have been moving on two fronts, with political and
legal advisers, preparing for the delivery of Starr's report to
Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers had been attempting this week to forestall the
delivery of Starr's report. After unsuccessfully seeking an advance
copy of the report on Monday, David Kendall, the president's
private lawyer, was planning to go to court to challenge the format
and the contents of Starr's report to Congress. The shipment of the
report to Capitol Hill pre-empted such a legal move.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the White House late on Wednesday afternoon, Kendall
briefly tried to characterize Starr's report to Congress as a
one-sided account. The voluminous materials, he said, ``represent
only the prosecutor's allegations, allegations that we have been
denied a chance to review.'' He added, ``But we do know this: There
is no basis for impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Constitution, Congress has the power to impeach the
president for treason, bribery or ``other high crimes and
misdemeanors.'' The House acts as the prosecutor and must initiate
any impeachment proceedings. The Senate is the jury.

MARKET PLACE: FOR TRADING IN LIVENT, AN INDEFINITE INTERMISSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ While Livent Inc. continues to sell tickets to its
Broadway show ``Ragtime,'' the theater company's investors cannot
sell their shares.
</P>
<P>
   Stock exchange officials in the United States and in Canada,
where the company is based, halted trading of Livent's shares on
Aug. 10 after the company's new management announced that it had
discovered serious accounting problems amounting to millions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   And Canadian securities regulators went a step further on Aug.
28, ordering a ban on all trading of Livent stock, even for
shareholders who may have been able to find buyers outside of the
exchanges. The Canadian regulators said the company had not
provided enough information about its problems for investors to
make informed decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Hundreds of frustrated investors have been left
wondering just how much, if anything, their Livent shares are
worth. The last price recorded on Nasdaq was $6.75. In Canadian
dollars, it was $10.15.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders rarely find themselves in such a bind. Even
stockholders of Cendant Corp., which announced in April that it had
discovered accounting irregularities of more than $100 million,
were able to sell shares on the day after the news came out. A
spokeswoman for the New York Stock Exchange said that Cendant
officials had provided enough information about accounting woes for
the exchange to consider it appropriate for investors to make
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Livent's shareholders have been left mostly to guess.
</P>
<P>
   Shauna Sexsmith, vice president for Canadian equities at
Altamira Management Ltd. in Toronto, one of Livent's biggest
investors, said that the mutual fund company wrote down its shares
after Roy Furman, the company's new chief executive, said on Aug.
10 that the financial statements sent to investors were wrong. That
same day, Furman said he was suspending the company's founders,
Garth Drabinsky and Myron Gottlieb, from their executive posts.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sexsmith did not say what price Altamira was placing on
Livent's stock, but she said that most of the mutual funds still
holding the stock had written down their investments from $3 to $6
(Canadian).
</P>
<P>
   Even if Canadian regulators lift the trading ban, she said, it
will be ``virtually impossible'' for large investors to sell shares
outside the exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at both Nasdaq and the Toronto Stock Exchange continue
to press Livent's new management team, headed by Michael Ovitz, the
former Hollywood talent agent and former president of Walt Disney
Co., for more information.
</P>
<P>
   But Livent officials have said little. And as forensic
accountants continue to sort through the books, angry investors
have filed class-action lawsuits against the company.
</P>
<P>
   A Livent spokesman declined on Friday to provide details about
what executives were doing to satisfy regulators and exchange
officials so the stock could resume trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company is conducting an extensive internal investigation
and is moving expeditiously to develop sufficient information so
that shareholders can make informed decisions,'' said Don Nathan,
the spokesman. ``In the meantime, the company will continue to work
cooperatively with all regulatory authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, The Toronto Star published an interview with Todd
Haimes, artistic director of the Roundabout Theater in New York,
who was named by Furman last week to be chief artistic director and
effectively act as Drabinsky's replacement. In the interview,
Haimes said his first conversation with Furman was on Aug. 5, five
days before the board suspended Drabinsky and said it had
discovered accounting problems.
</P>
<P>
   Haimes has said that his initial contact with Furman was brief
and only vaguely exploratory. But a spokesman for Drabinsky said
Wednesday that the timing of this initial interview indicated that
Livent had planned all along to oust Drabinsky and that the
allegations of irregular accounting were being used as a thin
justification.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our view, these were quite serious revelations that would
suggest management was pursuing an orchestrated plan to take over
not only financial control of the company, but artistic control,''
said the spokesman, David Weiner. ``This is what we've felt from
the beginning.''

 Host Marriott Checks In at the Ritz   By Ilana DeBare  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Host Marriott Corp. said yesterday that it has purchased the deluxe
San Francisco Ritz-Carlton for $161 million, solidifying its
already sizable presence in the city.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Ritz is now the fourth major San Francisco hotel owned by
the Bethesda, Md.-based firm: It already owns three Marriott
hotels, at Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco International Airport
and near the Moscone Center.
</P>
<P>
   Host Marriott's purchase of the Ritz from a closely held
partnership called Waverly Associates is unlikely to lead to any
changes in day-to-day operations at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   That's because even though ownership of the Nob Hill hotel has
changed, its management will remain the same _ Marriott
International, a separate company that owns the Ritz-Carlton brand
name and manages other Ritzes around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ritz-Carlton San Francisco is one of the highest-quality
hotels in America, and we are delighted to add it to our
distinctive portfolio of assets,'' said Terence Golden, president
and CEO of Host Marriott.
</P>
<P>
   Golden said the $161 million purchase price was lower than what
Host Marriott would have had to spend a year ago. That's because
the decline in stock prices this year has made it harder for real
estate investment firms to raise money to bid on hotel properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``As evidenced by the purchase price, acquisition pricing for
quality hotels has become more attractive,'' Golden said. ``The
recent downturn in the stock market and the reduction in capital
available to the real estate industry have had a favorable effect
on hotel prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts said Host Marriott's purchase of the San
Francisco Ritz fits well with the firm's long-term plans.
</P>
<P>
   Host Marriott was created in 1993 as a spin-off from Marriott
International. Today, Host Marriott owns hotels and other real
estate, while Marriott International remains in the
hotel-management business. Richard and J. Williard Marriott Jr.
continue to sit on the boards of both firms.
</P>
<P>
   Host Marriott currently owns 104 upscale full-service hotels,
along with several dozen retirement communities.
</P>
<P>
   It's spinning off the retirement communities into a separate
company while expanding its hotel holdings. Since April, it has
bought more than a dozen new hotels, including Ritz-Carltons in
Boston, Michigan and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marriott's strategy within a given market is to acquire the
highest-quality hotel assets in that market,'' said Michael
Mueller, an analyst with NationsBanc Montgomery Securities. ``They
prefer urban markets where there are high barriers to entry''
because there is little land for new hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Host Marriott officials have predicted that the Ritz's earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization would amount
to $18.6 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   That means the purchase price amounted to 8.7 times the hotel's
earnings _ a good deal, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a very attractive multiple for the type of asset this
is,'' Mueller said. ``It's less than they would have paid six to 12
months ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ritz-Carlton opened eight years ago in a 1909 building that
used to house the western headquarters of Metropolitan Life
Insurance. It has two restaurants, three lounges, about 14,400
square feet of meeting space, and a fitness center and pool.
</P>
<P>
   Host Marriott shares fell 19 cents yesterday to $13.38.

NEW OR OLD, OPERA STEALS THE SHOW  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 13)

   MICHAEL TILSON THOMAS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Music director, San Francisco Symphony &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a lifelong Ives enthusiast, I'm intrigued that a premiere is
taking place next month at the Cleveland Orchestra, with Alan
Feinberg as pianist and Christoph von Dohnanyi conducting.
</P>
<P>
   The Ives scholar David G. Porter has reconstructed the
``Emerson'' Piano Concerto, based on much of the profound material
we know from the ``Concord'' Sonata and the Fourth Symphony. It
should be a fascinating experience.
</P>
<P>
   I'm also a big fan of the work of Meredith Monk and Steven
Mackey. Meredith's ``Magic Frequencies,'' a new multimedia piece
about outer space, science fiction and folk art, had a preview this
summer at Jacob's Pillow in Massachusetts and will have its
premiere in late October in Munich. Steve has written a new opera,
``Ravenshead,'' based on the totally true and completely outrageous
saga of a doomed sailing race around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Paul Dresher Ensemble Electro-Acoustic Band and the
performance artist Rinde Eckert will give the premiere in early
November at Pennsylvania State University, and then the work goes
on a national tour.
</P>
<P>
   It's also exciting to know that Lou Harrison is at work
finishing his opera ``Young Caesar'' and that the vocalist Robert
Osborne is completing a Henry Cowell disc for Albany Records. &QL;

<P>
   When people find out I'm an opera singer, they often say that it
must be wonderful to travel the world singing. Well, it is, but I
often wonder what it would be like to be on the other side of the
curtain, actually to see performances once in a while. Sadly, it's
a rare occurrence, and when I'm not rehearsing or performing, I
usually opt to stay in and rest.
</P>
<P>
   One event I hope to attend is the new production of ``La
Traviata'' at the Metropolitan Opera in November, starring two of
my dear friends, Renee Fleming and Vladimir Chernov. James Levine
is conducting, and ever since I worked with him in ``La
Cenerentola,'' I've been a fan.
</P>
<P>
   Everything about this ``Traviata'' makes me want to see it. In
fact, it was this very opera that inspired me to become a singer. I
was 10, and my parents took me to see the Met on tour. The lights
went down, the conductor came out, the music started, and I was
hooked. Although I will never sing the role of Violetta, I would at
least like to hear it and see it at the Met. If I'm anywhere near
New York, I'll be there. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   STEVE REICH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Composer &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most interesting artistic events in New York that I'm aware
of start with Bang on a Can, certainly the liveliest musical group
of its generation. Michael Gordon, a director of Bang on a Can, has
a new opera, ``Chaos,'' for amplified and processed singers and a
tape made with drum machines, samplers and synthesizers.
</P>
<P>
   It will be presented at the Kitchen next month. Michael is
collaborating with the director Bob McGrath and the librettist
Matthew Maguire, and he says that the libretto involves elements of
chaos theory.
</P>
<P>
   The story is about two contemporary scientists, a man and a
woman, who try to reach the ``chaos zone.'' They succeed and meet
Pierre and Marie Curie there. I heard a few minutes of the music,
minus the singers, and found it mysterious and intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   Michael is at the forefront of his generation, using conflicting
simultaneous rhythms to create powerful, highly energized music.
</P>
<P>
   I'm also enthusiastic about Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker, who will
be at the Kitchen as well this month. She's undoubtedly one of the
two or three finest choreographers alive. Along with Jiri Killian
and Pina Bausch, she has moved the center of modern dance to
Europe. Who would have thought it possible? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FRANCESCA ZAMBELLO &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Operatic stage director &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's often said that this is the age of the director. Certainly
no sensible person would say: ``We're in the age of great
composers. Let's go see so-and-so's fabulous new opera.'' Why is
that? Partly because composers in the postwar era lost the ability
to tell gripping stories and write forceful music, leaving it to
so-called singing actors and exhausted directors to put some life
into often desiccated works.
</P>
<P>
   Well, this director thinks and hopes that things may be
changing. It's no longer a crime to write a tune.
</P>
<P>
   I'm glad that Marvin David Levy is around to witness the revival
of his ``Mourning Becomes Elektra'' next month at the Lyric Opera
of Chicago, and I hope to be there. It's a powerful piece based on
Aeschylus, and it reminds us that opera needs to be about
characters and plot. It can't just be polemical or theoretical. I
don't doubt that the compelling Lauren Flanigan will triumph as
Christine Mannon.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, I expect Renee Fleming to be spellbinding this
month at the San Francisco Opera as Blanche in Andre Previn's
``Streetcar Named Desire,'' which is also composed in an accessible
style. Maybe we're heading into a new age of American romanticism
that builds on the generation of Ned Rorem, Samuel Barber and
Carlisle Floyd. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AARON JAY KERNIS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Composer &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vocal music is my first love, and I'm especially interested in
the wealth of vocal works to be unveiled this season. I can't wait
to see the New York premieres of Steve Reich's ``Hindenburg'' and
the young English composer Thomas Ades' ``Powder Her Face'' this
fall at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. And I'm excited about
Michael Gordon's potentially provocative ``Chaos'' at the Kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Out of town, I'll be eager to hear Christopher Rouse's new
orchestral song cycle, ``Kabir Padaavali,'' in January, performed
by Dawn Upshaw and the Minnesota Orchestra. I'm also looking
forward to the premiere of the first opera by another young English
composer, Simon Holt's ``Nightingale's to Blame,'' in November at
the Huddersfield Festival in England.
</P>
<P>
   And at the tender age of 90, Elliott Carter is completing his
first opera, to be given its premiere next spring in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   In April, there are two fascinating nonvocal premieres by the
inspired and mystical Russian master Sofia Gubaidulina, a concerto
for koto, with the NHK Symphony, at Carnegie Hall, and a concerto
for two violas at the New York Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   But most important to note is the newest and freshest: four
energetic young men in their mid-20s _ Carter Pann, Kevin Putz,
David Mallamud and Gordon Beeferman _ who will have new works
performed at Carnegie Hall by the New York Youth Symphony.

 Web Free Speech Going Up in Smoke?   By Jon Swartz  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Congress has declared war on junk e-mail with a blitzkrieg of bills
banning the annoying messages.

in the lap of ISPs during e-mail screenings. Junk mailers,
meanwhile, claim that government-ordered mandatory language in
their messages undercuts their right to communicate freely under
the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Internet proponents are particularly galled by the Consumer
Anti-slamming and Spamming Prevention Act, currently floating in
the House. It would require spammers to use the phrase
``unsolicited commercial mail'' within the text of messages. Then
Internet service companies would be obligated to check e-mail for
that phrase and block it from subscribers who don't want spam.
Opponents say the bill would illegally infringe spammers' rights to
free speech and, more ominously, strong-arm ISPs into a law
enforcement role.
</P>
<P>
   Another bill _ co-sponsored by Senator Robert Torricelli,
D-N.J., and unanimously approved in the Senate in May _ would fine
junk e-mailers up to $15,000 if they mask their identities with
forged addresses. It, too, includes a provision requiring cyber
businesses to tag e-mail subject headers with disclaimers such as
``solicitation'' and ``$$.'' The Consumer Antislamming Act still
needs to pass the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it objectionable from a privacy and content
standpoint,'' said Deirdre Mulligan, staff counsel for the liberal
Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington, D.C. ``Anytime
you regulate speech on the Internet, you have to ask, `Are there
non-First Amendment (infringing) ways to deal with it?' There
aren't many.''
</P>
<P>
   Even lawmakers _ like Representative Billy Tauzin, R-La., who
authored The Consumer Anti-slamming and Spamming Prevention Act _
admit they are hamstrung in attempting to protect consumers from a
deluge of spam while being ``sensitive'' to free speech.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Singer, a spokesman for Senator Torricelli, noted &LR;   &LR; the
difficulty of preparing a bill that ``tries to nurture e-commerce
and protect free-speech rights while reducing spam _ all at the
same time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a delicate balancing act,'' acknowledged Tauzin, chairman
of the influential House Telecommunications Subcommittee. ``I've
heard the concerns about its constitutionality and agree. We're
working on them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But people also have the right to listen as well as speak,''
Tauzin said. ``No one should be paying for an e-mail account
crammed with spam.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 10 billion pieces of spam _ messages shilling sex
sites, miracle cures and fly-by-night business scams _ course
through the Internet each year, jamming pipelines and individuals'
e-mail accounts, according to industry experts.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer outrage has prompted _ some say forced _ politicians to
hurriedly draft legislation that may have cut constitutional
corners, online legal experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians' task may have been made even more ticklish, they
say, by the lack of laws that apply to the fledgling Internet
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no good way, legislatively, to solve the problem,''
said David Sobel, legal counsel at the nonpartisan Electronic
Privacy Information Center in Washington, D.C. ``Any law that
mandates certain language in e-mail poses constitutional
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite First Amendment concerns about the spamming bills,
support runs deep for both bills and a third, the Netizens
Protection Act sponsored by Representative Chris Smith, R-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's measure would amend the Telephone Consumer Protection
Act of 1991, which bans unsolicited junk faxes, to also regulate
junk e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   If any, or all, of the bills are passed, they will put a damper
on the proliferation of spam, industry observers said.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-spam sentiment is being stoked by consumers, who are
sick of receiving the unwanted e-mail, and by Internet service
providers, whose systems are being used to send the messages.
</P>
<P>
   In July, a group of Internet giants, led by America Online and
AT&AMP;T, submitted a report to the Federal Trade Commission demanding
that federal and state regulators be granted the authority to
prosecute spammers. AOL and others have been forced to file costly
lawsuits to evict junk e-mailers from their systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question, most politicians who are working on these bills
do not understand the Internet and e-mail, and there is a rush to
pass them,'' conceded Paul Hoffman, director of the Internet Mail
Consortium in Santa Cruz. ``But to call them unconstitutional is a
stretch. There are so few Internet laws that have been tested
constitutionally.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a free-speech issue; it is a property-rights issue,''
added J.D. Falk, a San Francisco-based board member of Coalition
Against Unsolicited Commercial Email. ``We've tried to stop spam
through technical and social means for years. Now it's time to try
legal means.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Tauzin agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can wait for the FCC to cure it, and hell will freeze
over,'' he said. ``We have to combine common sense and the
constitution. Our bill is evolving, for heaven's sake. Don't get
your shirttail out over it.''

 Record Labels Fear Move to Digital Format Will Encourage Piracy   By Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
What happens when millions of college kids get new software that
makes it easy to copy and transmit music over the Internet?
<TEXT>
<P>
   The answer is fear and loathing at the big recording labels,
which wonder if music pirates will hurt their $40 billion in
worldwide sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry is absolutely obsessed with preventing digital
piracy,'' said Robert von Goeben, a former Geffen Records exec
turned Silicon Valley venture capitalist.
</P>
<P>
   Motivated by this fear, the major music firms are fretting about
a race between competing technologies for digitizing sound _ one
entrant is an open standard that has no safeguards against
bootlegging, the other contestants are proprietary technologies
with controls to discourage unauthorized copying.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of all the fuss is an obscure technology called MP3.
Created last year by the International Standards Organization, MP3
compresses music files, so that a three-minute song, normally 45
megabytes, can be squeezed into a 3-megabyte chunk _ small enough
to transmit over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened is that a bunch of college kids picked up on how
good MP3 sound was, and started copying music and sending it to
their friends,'' said Gene Hoffman, 23-year-old founder and chief
executive of GoodNoise, a Palo Alto firm that sells music in the
MP3 format.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the best way to stop piracy is to make music so cheap
it isn't worth copying,'' said Hoffman, who publishes little-known,
independent artists who are willing to sell digital singles on the
Web for 99 cents, or 10-packs of sound for $9.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Mooradian, who follows digital music for Jupiter
Communications in New York, said MP3 has gained millions of
adherents in less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We surveyed top search engines recently and found that MP3 was
the most-searched-for word on the Internet after sex,'' Mooradian
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``MP3 has a lot of momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   To blunt that momentum, the Big Five music publishers _ Sony,
BMG, Warner Music, Universal and EMI _ are considering three
alternative technologies for digitizing music.
</P>
<P>
   All include some anti-copying mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   Liquid Audio, the Redwood City startup backed by venture
capitalist Hummer Winblad, is the leading contender to become the
music industry's preferred source of ``protected'' digital sound.
</P>
<P>
   Also vying for the industry's blessing are a2b Music, a New York
spin-off of AT&AMP;T, and IBM's Madison Project, a trial effort in
which Big Blue will help Sony and Warner Music test-market digital
music while preventing rampant copying.
</P>
<P>
   a2b president Larry Miller said digital music will remain a
fringe technology, until and unless the Big Five, who control the
top artists, commit to releasing their songs in digital form.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't buy technology, they buy music,'' Miller said.
``This won't happen until the big record companies put their stuff
online.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Butterworth, president of SonicNet, the top music site
on the Web, said music labels are getting the jitters about jumping
from vinyl and plastic to digital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a sea change in distribution, and they
have to be certain they won't give away the store,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Mooradian, the Jupiter analyst, says industry has a year or
two, tops, in which to pick one of the ``safe'' digital
alternatives. Otherwise, MP3 releases from independent labels _
which account for 20 percent of all music sales _ combined with
pirated name-brand sound, could make MP3 the market standard.
</P>
<P>
   There are tentative signs this could happen. MP3 music is a
limited threat if people can only listen on PCs. But several
manufacturers are already selling portable ``MP3men,'' _ headsets
that can store several digital songs on a flash memory card so
music-lovers can listen while they jog.
</P>
<P>
   If, and it's a long if, these MP3men help create a mass market
for digital music, big record labels could be dragged, howling and
unprotected, into the digital age.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Kohn, chairman and chief MP3 troublemaker at GoodNoise,
thinks the Beta vs. VHS battle set a precedent for naughty content
picking the winner in a format war.
</P>
<P>
   Kohn, co-author of one of the main reference books on music
licensing, said back in the '70s, the Beta camp refused to license
its technology to porn vendors. VHS manufacturers had no such
qualms. Porn appeared on VHS. People bought VHS players to watch
porn, and eventually created enough of a market to drag legitimate
movies along.
</P>
<P>
   Sipping coffee the other day in Palo Alto, Kohn, a veteran of
Borland Software in its prime, said simply, ``Pirated music is our
porn.''

 Computer Pioneers Head a Little-Known S.F. Team for Microsoft   By Benny Evangelista  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Back in the 1960s,   even computer industry pioneers like Gordon
Bell and Jim Gray had trouble visualizing the computer as anything
more than a giant electronic abacus.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The whole notion that you use computers for writing or that
you use computers to replace the telephone or that you use
computers to make virtual reality seemed pretty fantastic at the
time,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   Now from their eighth-floor offices overlooking the Bay Bridge
and downtown San Francisco, Gray and Bell head a small team of
Microsoft Corp. researchers who visualize a day in the
not-too-distant future when computers will be even more interwoven
into daily life.
</P>
<P>
   And what they can see still gets the two respected veterans of
the computer industry fired up.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's most fun is I'm a computer user,'' Bell, 64, said with
glee. ``I like to sit there all day with this machine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be astonishing,'' said Gray, 54. ``We are going
to see a lot more progress in the next 10 years than we've seen in
the last 50.''
</P>
<P>
   Both are the senior researchers at Microsoft's Bay Area Research
Center at 301 Howard St. The local seven-person operation is a
small part of Microsoft's team of 300 researchers. The other labs
are at Microsoft's Redmond, Wash., headquarters and in Cambridge,
England.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft CEO Bill Gates recently said he envisions boosting his
budget for worldwide research and development more than $3 billion
a year up from $2.2 billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Microsoft has been paying top dollar to recruit top
computer scientists like Gray and Bell.
</P>
<P>
   The company went along with the duo three years ago when they
wanted to open a local laboratory rather than move to another
location like Redmond.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the ability to locate an office or workplace anywhere
in the world is at the heart of Bell's research into
``telepresence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's being there without being there,'' Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   Far beyond simple teleconferencing, telepresence would allow,
for example, a business executive in San Francisco to conduct a
meeting with other executives in Tokyo, with people on both sides
of the Pacific still able to share computer-relayed,
three-dimensional sights, sounds and personal interaction, Bell
said.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting could be recorded and played back for those who
couldn't attend the live meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Or, Gray said, a football fan could tune into a ballgame and
view the game from the perspective of the football or the
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Bell is called the father of the minicomputer because of his
23-year career as vice president of research and development at
Digital Equipment Corp., where he was the architect of DEC's
best-selling VAX minicomputer.
</P>
<P>
   After Bell left DEC in 1983, he went on to co-found tech
startups like Encore Computers, a storage vendor; became assistant
director of computer-information science and engineering for the
National Science Foundation; and was a professor of computer
science at Carnegie Mellon University.
</P>
<P>
   Bell received the nation's highest technology award, the
National Medal of Technology, from President George Bush in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Now a Los Altos resident, Bell also advises and invests in
computer startups. He authored the 1991 book, ``High Tech Ventures:
The Guide to Entrepreneurial Success.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the computer-research community, Gordon is one of the
really respected graybeards and had a tremendous impact on the
industry,'' said Lawrence A. Rowe, professor of electrical
engineering and computer science at the University of California at
Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Gray, meanwhile, is the Bay Area Research Center's manager and
is focusing his research on ``fault-tolerant and scalable
clusters.'' Basically, Gray describes his work as the concept of
tying the power of a network of computers into a crash-resistant
megacomputer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scalable computing is being able to buy computing by the
slice,'' Gray said. ``We're trying to come up with computer
architecture that can grow without limits. If you have a bigger
problem, you just go down to Fry's or wherever you shop and you buy
a little bit more computing, plug it in and it auto-magically
works.''
</P>
<P>
   An example comes from another of Gray's research projects, a
two-year effort by Microsoft, the United States Geological Service
and the Russian Space Agency to compile up-to-the minute satellite
photographs of every section of Earth.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the project has cataloged photos for only about 3
percent of the Earth's surface, and the data is stored in one
30-ton server at Microsoft headquarters in Redmond. The photos are
accessible on the Internet at  &LR; www.terraserver.microsoft.com. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   About 30 more of those servers would be needed to catalog just
one day's worth of photos of the entire Earth, but under the
scalable-computing concept, the data could be decentralized among a
huge network of computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to drive a stake in the heart of the mainframe,'' Bell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gray, a North Beach resident, is renowned for a 25-year career
at the forefront of computer databases, starting in the early 1970s
for IBM and later working for Tandem Computers and DEC.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the leading lights in database-management
systems,'' Rowe said.
</P>
<P>
   Gray left DEC when that company sold its database business to
Oracle Corp. and was a lecturer at UC Berkeley when Microsoft
tapped him to head the Bay Area Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``This seems to be an amazing time where a great deal is being
done,'' Gray said. ``I can't think of a great many times in history
where there has been this phase change in society, and I really
want to be a part of it. I'm very optimistic about what it's going
to do for everybody.''

GOP MISSILE DEFENSE BILL LOSES BY ONE VOTE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the second time in four months, the Senate on
Wednesday blocked a bill to require establishing a national defense
against long-range missiles as soon as the technology was
available.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have made the speedy deployment of an antimissile
system a top national-security priority this year, and tried to use
the issue in the November elections to paint Democrats as soft on
national defense.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats oppose the system because, they say, it is based on
antiquated technology and would undermine international weapons
treaties.
</P>
<P>
   The 59-41 vote was mostly along party lines. While it was enough
to approve the measure, it was one vote shy of the 60 needed under
Senate rules to end a Democratic filibuster. No senator switched
sides from a vote on the same bill in May, and Wednesday's outcome
most likely closes the issue in the Senate this year, although the
House will probably vote on a similar bill this month.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans came armed Wednesday with ammunition they hoped
would sway Wednesday's vote: An influential commission has warned
that countries like North Korea and Iraq could develop long-range
missiles capable of hitting the United States much sooner and with
less warning than the government has projected.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could very well be a missile heading in our direction as
we speak,'' Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., said in a 45-minute debate.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is developing a national missile
defense and, along with many congressional Democrats, argues that
the country can afford to wait until 2000 to decide whether to
field such a system and when, depending on the threat and available
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's make sure we deploy the best initial system not simply
the first one off the shelf,'' said Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on Wednesday gleefully cited a letter written to
Inhofe on Aug. 24 by Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for the nation's military leaders, Shelton said, ``We
reaffirm our support for the current national missile defense
policy and deployment readiness program.''
</P>
<P>
   All 55 Republicans voted for the measure as did 4 Democrats:
Daniel Inouye and Daniel Akaka of Hawaii, Joseph Lieberman of
Connecticut and Ernest Hollings of South Carolina.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ever since President Ronald Reagan first broached the idea of a
national missile defense _ a space-based network called Star Wars
by its critics _ Republicans have wrestled to defend the plan's
technological pitfalls and price tag that now stands at more than
$45 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The system Republicans supported Wednesday is a more limited,
land-based defense that would knock down a missile launched
accidentally or deliberately by another country.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats argued that this system relied on inferior
technology and that deploying it now would undermine the
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, a landmark arms control deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will weaken and jeopardize our national security,'' said
Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the Armed
Services Committee. ``All we will do if we pass this bill is
contribute to the proliferation of nuclear weapons in Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., added: ``We don't need a rush to
failure in the national missile defense program.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans said the nation could no longer depend on
American intelligence agencies to give ample warning to an enemy
attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``The assumption is that our intelligence community are so
sophisticated and so reliable, that we'll be able to have
warning,'' said Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., who championed the
bill. ``Do we proceed with the wait-and-see policy of the
administration or proceed as soon as the technology permits?''

COMMITMENT, SUCCESS AND THE AGE OF AMBIVALENCE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn.)   (af)  
 Elysa Gardner writes frequently about entertainment.  
 By ELYSA GARDNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Discussing her career recently, the actress Reese
Witherspoon felt compelled to make a confession. ``I use this
threat, whenever I get disappointed with the movie business,'' she
said, lowering her voice and narrowing her cornflower-blue eyes
ominously. ``I say, `This is it _ I'm going to med school!' I would
love to be a pediatric surgeon.''
</P>
<P>
   Chatting in a restaurant in Manhattan, Ms. Witherspoon veered
from such pensive asides to moments in which she spoke giddily,
even rhapsodically, about life as a fledgling 22-year-old movie
star.
</P>
<P>
   In one breath, she would gush about how exciting it was to work
with Paul Newman and Susan Sarandon in the thriller ``Twilight,''
released earlier this year, or to act opposite her boyfriend, Ryan
Phillippe, in the forthcoming ``Cruel Intentions,'' an updating of
``Les Liaisons Dangereuses.''
</P>
<P>
   In the next, she would lament the way that the news media
glorify her profession. ``I'm so tired of reading about these
ridiculous actors and their ridiculous lives,'' she said, sounding
convincingly jaded.
</P>
<P>
   The women that Ms. Witherspoon has played on screen,
particularly in smaller films like 1995's ``Fear'' and ``Freeway,''
have also been complex, sometimes contradictory creatures; and the
four characters she will introduce this fall and winter prove no
exception.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Pleasantville,'' a seriocomic fantasy that opens next
month, she portrays Jennifer, a hyper-popular '90s teen-ager _ Ms.
Witherspoon's kewpie-doll prettiness and pert demeanor still lend
themselves to adolescent roles _ who is literally transported to
the black-and-white world of a '50s television series.
</P>
<P>
   Tracey Flick, her character in ``Election,'' a satire in which
she co-stars with Matthew Broderick, could be Jennifer's foil: a
rigid, over-achieving high school student. In ``Cruel Intentions''
and ``Best Laid Plans,'' both due early next year, she portrays,
respectively, the trusting but plucky Annette, a younger, modern
version of the Madame de Tourvel role played by Michelle Pfeiffer
in 1988's ``Dangerous Liaisons,'' and Lissa, a woman who schemes
with her lover to escape a desolate town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to love the character and the director, because I lose
myself when I'm making a movie,'' Ms. Witherspoon said. ``When I
see the movie, it doesn't even occur to me that it's me I'm
watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who have worked with Ms. Witherspoon praise her unaffected
intensity. ``She commits to a character so completely,'' said Gary
Ross, who wrote and directed ``Pleasantville.'' ``And she
understands comedy. I think she's going to be an enormous movie
star, in the way that Carole Lombard was an enormous movie star.''
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of a doctor and a nursing professor, Ms.
Witherspoon grew up in Nashville, Tenn., and at the age of 14 made
her first film, ``The Man in the Moon.'' She received glowing
notices for her performance as a girl vying with her sister for the
attentions of a boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first four years I was in this business, I was usually
just playing someone's child or girlfriend,'' Ms. Witherspoon said.
That changed with ``Freeway,'' in a more three-dimensional role as
a troubled, precocious girl with a dark past. ``Once I overcame the
hurdle of that movie _ which scared me to death _ I felt like I
could try anything,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Witherspoon, who is on leave from undergraduate studies in
English literature at Stanford University, still views acting with
some ambivalence. ``I don't like a lot of movies,'' she said. ``You
have to be selective. I have no desire to be the girl on the cover
of six magazines at once. I'd rather wait for the right project to
come along. And it always does.''

DIGITAL EXECUTIVES TELL OF HOW GATES' THREATS KILLED A PRODUCT 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MICROSOFT-SUBPOENAS.) 
(th) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ Offering new evidence supporting the
government's allegations that Microsoft Corp. routinely suppresses
competition in any new market that might threaten its monopoly in
personal computer operating systems, five current and former
executives of Digital Equipment Corp. said that their company was
forced to drop a planned Internet product last year under threats
from Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   The Digital Equipment executives said that the company disbanded
a product development group based here after Gates told Robert
Palmer, who at the time was Digital's chief executive, that a
product the group was developing with a Microsoft rival, Oracle
Corp., would threaten an earlier deal for Microsoft to develop a
version of its industrial-strength Windows NT operating system for
Digital's powerful new processor.
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft spokesman Wednesday night called his company's
relationship with Digital a ``model partnership'' and insisted that
no improper pressure was applied to force it from any new business.
</P>
<P>
   In an alliance with Oracle that began in late 1996, Digital had
developed 1,800 copies of a prototype computer code-named ``Shark''
that, the executives said, represented potentially lucrative
products in both business and education markets.
</P>
<P>
   Shark threatened Microsoft because it was based on the Network
Computer standard that was developed jointly by a number of
Microsoft's competitors, including Oracle, Apple Computer, IBM and
Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations of the Digital executives were echoed Wednesday
by Lawrence Ellison, Oracle's chairman and a longtime foe of Gates.
Ellison said that Palmer had called him in July 1997 to inform him
that the project was being canceled. He said that Palmer refused to
divulge the reason for his decision to cancel the project but told
Ellison, ``If I'm subpoenaed, I'll tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer did not return phone calls Wednesday night seeking
comments on the statements of the Digital executives and Ellison.
</P>
<P>
   A former Digital employee and member of the Shark team said
Wednesday night that it was not until after the project had been
canceled that the researchers were told of Microsoft's objection to
the project by Robert Supnik, Digital's vice president of research
and advanced development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we stopped working, people wanted to know why,'' said
David Chaiken, a former researcher at Digital's Systems Research
Center in Palo Alto. So he asked Supnik, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that Mr. Gates had told Mr. Palmer, `You have to
decide if you're Larry's friend or my friend,' Chaiken recalled
Supnik's telling him. ``They looked at the revenue that Digital
received from its relationship with Oracle and the revenue it
received from its relationship with Microsoft and figured out which
number was bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   The Shark team was part of Digital's Internet Applications
Group, a 30-person development effort working on a simple network
computer aimed at the office market and designed to run with
software developed by Oracle.
</P>
<P>
   The prototype machines are still in use in a number of Digital's
research laboratories, the executives said. Recently, 60 of the
machines were given to a junior high school in Palo Alto where they
are currently being used in the school library and in classrooms, a
Digital executive said.
</P>
<P>
   Several Digital executives said that they were notified of the
cancellation of the Shark project during a visit to their
laboratories by William Strecker, the company's chief technology
officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bad week,'' recalled one Digital researcher who
worked on the project, ``Princess Diana, Mother Teresa and the
Shark all died during the same week.''
</P>
<P>
   After Strecker told the key executives in Palo Alto that the
project had been canceled, it fell to one of the laboratory
managers to make the announcement in an auditorium near the project
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``People threw things at him,'' recalled one person who was
present at the meeting. He said there were also angry cries of
``necktie damage,'' engineers' slang for poor decisions made by a
company's top management.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison said that Oracle and Digital had been bidding on a
number of major projects in Asia based on the Network Computer
design, including a potential order for 500,000 machines in China.
He said that Digital's decision to withdraw from the business
effectively ended the project.

THE 36 BOXES: AN ABRUPT CHANGE OF EVENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With stunning abruptness, all of Washington has
been transformed.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of the 36 boxes of reports, narrative, grand-jury
testimony, videotapes and documents on Capitol Hill heralded the
arrival of a very different phase in the embattled administration
of Bill Clinton _ one that is sober in its meaning for Congress,
chilling in its implications for the presidency, momentous in its
significance for history.
</P>
<P>
   Now Kenneth W. Starr is no longer simply an investigator but a
prosecutor, Congress is no longer simply a legislative body but a
judge of another branch of government, Clinton is no longer simply
the chief executive but, politically if not yet legally, a
defendant, and Washington is no longer simply a political capital
but the setting of a great constitutional drama.
</P>
<P>
   The 36 boxes now under armed guard in a congressional annex far
from tourist Washington may remake the constitutional balance of
power and will almost certainly reshape the presidency for years,
even generations, to come. But they will also create new
expectations of presidential behavior and shrink to a vanishing
point the place of privacy in political life.
</P>
<P>
   They could break the presidency of Bill Clinton and make the
careers of lawmakers hardly known beyond their own districts.
</P>
<P>
   Only twice in American history has Congress walked the path that
the 105th Congress seems about to embark upon, and though the House
has not yet formally set in train the machinery of impeachment, it
became clear Wednesday afternoon that the crisis engulfing the
Clinton administration would soon consume the entire capital.
</P>
<P>
   Watergate, which led to the resignation of Richard Nixon in
1974, and Reconstruction, which led to the impeachment and near
conviction of Andrew Johnson in 1868, became markers in the
nation's story, moments of high drama that shaped American
political and social history, American political and social
institutions _ and American political and social expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The 36 boxes will almost certainly do no less.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's struggle for survival and his midsummer resignation
shaped the political consciousness of the young Bill Clinton. It
drew the young Hillary Rodham to Washington, where the
brown-covered report of the House Judiciary Committee would list
the recent Yale Law School graduate as one of the committee's
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons' present struggle is shaping the political
viewpoints of the next generation of American leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The Watergate investigation elevated Senator Howard H. Baker Jr.
of Tennessee from a Capitol Hill fixture to a national figure. It
provided a platform for the minority counsel, a 30-year-old
Nashville lawyer named Fred D. Thompson, to use to rise to the
Senate himself. It transformed Senator Sam J. Ervin Jr. of North
Carolina, the chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Watergate,
from a rustic figure into a figure of respect. It transformed
Representative Peter W. Rodino Jr. of New Jersey, the chairman of
the House Judiciary Committee, from a bit player who confined his
interest to immigration matters to a figure of probity.
</P>
<P>
   It launched the careers of Representative Trent Lott of
Mississippi, who now is the Senate majority leader, and
Representative Bill Cohen of Maine, who now is secretary of
defense. It helped propel Representative Paul S. Sarbanes of
Maryland to the Senate and provided a perch for a young lawyer,
William F. Weld, who would eventually become governor of
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The 36 boxes will prompt some of the lawmakers on the House
Judiciary Committee to feel the gentle tap of fate in the weeks and
months to come.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Watergate experience only a quarter-century ago has
so shaped Americans' expectations of presidential scandals, the 36
boxes also stand as symbols of how different are the agonies of
Nixon and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In Watergate the congressional committees were accumulators of
evidence. In the Washington sex wars, the Congress may be no more
than the evaluators of evidence accumulated elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's boxes, like Pandora's in ancient Greek mythology, hold
no treasures, only tragedy, and once they are opened, as they
almost certainly will be in the next week, they can never be closed
again. In these boxes sit Washington's biggest mystery. In these
boxes may be the makings of an impeachment resolution and the
unmaking of a presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't only the arrival of the boxes on Capitol Hill that
began the great change in the climate, political and legal, of
Washington. It was also the return to Capitol Hill of House members
from their summer recess. Ordinarily they bound into town after
their August holidays, ready to take on appropriations bills,
finish up their business and adjourn for the task they really care
about: running for reelection.
</P>
<P>
   This September they returned with a sense of foreboding
bordering on dread.
</P>
<P>
   The boxes in the House annex are, to be sure, a challenge to the
presidency. But they may be an even more formidable challenge to
the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Capitol Hill in the past decade has been mired in partisanship
and petty conflict. Now it is charged with the gravest task
contemplated by the Founders.
</P>
<P>
   The House leaders who met here Wednesday agreed not on how to
proceed with the Clinton inquiry on a nonpartisan basis but only on
the need to appear nonpartisan. But if the Clinton crisis proves
anything, it proves that mere appearances _ of family fidelity, of
faux nonpartisanship _ won't suffice in this atmosphere.
Washington's great test now begins, and, as an earlier generation
once chanted, the whole world is watching.

REFLECTIVE MCGWIRE CELEBRATES, GOES BACK TO WORK  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Mark McGwire was reflective and folksy on the day
after he became the most productive home run hitter for a season in
baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   But most important, McGwire was back to work with the St. Louis
Cardinals and said that he would probably play in all their
remaining games. For this, baseball and baseball fans may feel
blessed. Pitchers will not.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire could have taken off Wednesday night's game against the
Reds after smashing his unprecedented 62d homer on Tuesday night at
Busch Stadium in St. Louis, but he told Manager Tony La Russa that
he owed something to the more than 50,000 fans who bought tickets
in anticipation of seeing a momentous event. So McGwire batted
twice at Cinergy Field Wednesday night before departing, but did
not hit another home run, or even get a hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have 50,000 fans out there, you have to make some
sort of showing,'' McGwire said before the game.
</P>
<P>
   The aura around McGwire keeps growing in this memorable season.
He described himself as a ``normal person who happens to play
baseball,'' so, like a normal person, McGwire did his job Wednesday
night. But it was not normal that he was given a standing ovation
when he simply warmed up, and was treated like royalty by the
Cincinnati crowd when he batted in the first inning. Hundreds of
flashbulbs popped and the Reds fans stood and roared for more than
a minute.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire twice tried to enter the batter's box, but backed out
and waved his helmet to the crowd to try to dull the noise. McGwire
eventually grounded out to third base off Pete Harnisch, and
received more adulation.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling responsibilities to the fans, to himself, to the
Cardinals, to Roger Maris' legacy and even to Sammy Sosa's ability
to creep closer, McGwire does not want to idle on 62.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a few days off where they're scheduled,'' explained
McGwire, who lined out to left in the third and was replaced at
first base in the bottom of the inning. ``I think I'll finish the
season without any days off. I feel pretty good, and that's the
bottom line. I want to finish strong. Even though I've done well,
it's still not a finished product until Sept. 27.''
</P>
<P>
   La Russa marveled at McGwire's decision and his determination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Sept. 8 and he has 62,'' La Russa said. ``People came
looking for him on Feb. 8 and asked him if he could hit 62, and he
did it. I can't believe what he does. I'm in awe.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, a private man who has been forced to become much more
public as he evolved into the major leagues' home run king,
continued offering more snippets of himself during a 30-minute
interview before the game.
</P>
<P>
   With his arms folded and an ever-present baseball cap on his
head, McGwire spoke about receiving a congratulatory phone call
from President Clinton; about how special his 10-year-old son,
Matthew, felt after the Hall of Fame took his and the boy's
jerseys; about how he has studied videotape of the homer and the
ensuing celebration because he does not remember most of it; about
how he has ``not had a good cry yet'' and about how he would want
Robert Redford to play him in a movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've realized what I've done and I know how special it is, but
I think it's going to take a couple of days to sink in,'' McGwire
said. ``I want to see it and understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals did not leave Busch Stadium until about 1:30
Wednesday morning, more than three hours after the game ended,
because McGwire was with his family and was also taking pictures
with the Maris family and signing autographs for them. While
McGwire smiled and signed, his teammates waited.
</P>
<P>
   ``What were we going to do?'' second baseman Pat Kelly asked.
``Leave without him?''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, Tom Lampkin and McGwire had lunch together Wednesday,
after meeting in McGwire's room. Lampkin was startled. The greatest
home run hitter ever, a man who is 6 feet 5 inches and 250 pounds,
spent the first hours of his reign in a downtown hotel room that
resembled a broom closest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like if you break the most prestigious home run
record, you shouldn't be put in a room where the rooming list
blocks the television set,'' Lampkin said. ``The three of us
couldn't even move around without bumping into each other.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, the normal person, did not care about the room. Over a
lunch of barbecued ribs, McGwire peered at a picture of him lifting
Matthew in The Cincinnati Post and told Lampkin and Kelly that it
would be ``neat'' to get Wednesday's newspapers from different
cities and see how the record-breaking homer was covered. When
Kelly was paged by a friend who had just landed from Spain and
wanted to know details of the night, McGwire took the cellular
phone from Kelly and shocked the friend by giving him the ultimate
eyewitness account. ``For all the hubbub that was going on, he
talked for five minutes to someone he had met once,'' Kelly said.
``That's the kind of guy he is.''
</P>
<P>
   As McGwire laughed with more than 100 reporters, he appeared
loose enough to go grab a surfboard instead of a bat. McGwire said
the intensity of the pursuit had taught him that he is mentally and
physically stronger than he realized, and he understood that the
first question he would hear next spring would be whether or not he
could duplicate 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've amazed myself by doing it,'' McGwire said. ``When
I sit back after the season and I'm watching the playoffs or the
World Series, I think that's when it's going to hit me. I realize I
have two weeks left and I'm not going to stop. It's pretty
amazing.''

 WASHINGTON: the jury. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No president has faced such an inquiry since the Watergate
scandal, when the House Judiciary Committee approved three articles
of impeachment against Nixon. He resigned in 1974 before an
impeachment vote by the full House.
</P>
<P>
   Because the House has no standing rules for handling
impeachment, House leaders had just begun to negotiate procedures
when Starr caught them by surprise by sending his report on their
first day back from recess.
</P>
<P>
   As the vans carrying the boxes arrived at the Capitol,
Republican leaders were gathered across the street in front of the
Library of Congress for a news conference on their agenda. Even as
the white and black vans were pulling up, House Speaker Newt
Gingrich was saying he could not confirm their arrival.
</P>
<P>
   With the Capitol rife with rumor late on Wednesday afternoon,
Gingrich, in an unusual move, took questions on the House floor
regarding the report and the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   Because the House has yet to pass a resolution setting out its
procedures, the boxes of documents were put under armed guard in
the nearby Gerald R. Ford House Office building, named for the
Republican who assumed the presidency when Nixon resigned.
</P>
<P>
   There the boxes were put under control of the Sergeant of Arms
and the Capitol Police. In preparation, the locks on the room where
the documents will be stored have been changed in the past few
days.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, R-Ga., said that no House member will have access to
the report until the House passes the resolution, which was being
drafted through the night and expected to be brought to the House
floor as early as Friday.
</P>
<P>
   As the rapid-fire events hurtled forward, members of Congress
seemed acutely aware of the historic responsibility they faced.
Earlier in the day, Sen. Robert Byrd, the chamber's unofficial
historian, compared Clinton to Nixon in his tactics of attack and
delay: ``Many of the mistakes that President Nixon made are being
made all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   But the West Virginia Democrat pleaded from the Senate floor
that Congress practice restraint. ``If sometime in the future, the
American people should come to believe that this president or any
other president has been driven out of office for what they may
perceive to be political reasons, their wrath will fall on those
who jumped to judgment prematurely.''
</P>
<P>
   After their own morning meeting to consider how to handle the
report, Gingrich and House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt put aside
their usual bitter partisanship, to answer questions in Gingrich's
suite, along with three other senior Republicans and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt called impeachment the most grave task facing Congress
next to declaring war. And Rep. Henry Hyde, the chairman of the
House Judiciary Committee, which oversees the process, called the
decision facing the House an ``exercise in individual conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich bristled when one reporter tried to ask whether
lawmakers could ignore the upcoming midterm elections as they weigh
the president's fate. ``Yes,'' he interrupted. ``Yes, yes, yes,
yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said House leaders leaned toward quick public access to
Starr's report, with other raw materials such as grand jury
testimony reviwed by the Judiciary Committee to find ways to
protect ``innocent people'' incidentally mentioned in testimony.
</P>
<P>
   But the House's job was made harder when Starr did not, as
lawmakers had hoped, send an executive summary of his findings.
``We wanted a summary and didn't get one,'' Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the report to Congress had a 25-page introduction, a
280- page narrative of events, and a 140-page section laying out
possible grounds for impeachment. Attached to the report are six
three-ring binders of 2,000 pages of additional materials.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen boxes more contain audio and video tapes and
transcripts, including the president's testimony to the grand jury
and Ms. Lewinsky's description of her relationship with the
president, secretly tape recorded by Linda Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   In his formal referral letter to Gingrich and Gephardt, Starr
pled with lawmakers to treat as confidential ``information of a
personal nature'' contained in supporting materials with the
report.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, Gingrich, Gephardt and some key lieutenants
huddled in another meeting trying to resolve differences over the
draft resolution that will set procedures for turning Starr's
report over to the Judiciary Commmittee. Rep. Gerald Solomon,
R-N.Y., and chairman of the House Rules Committee, said his panel
will draft a two-part resolution. The first section will deal with
making the report public, and it should come to a House floor vote
on Friday. He said the report would most likely be released Friday
afternoon.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The White House and Republicans and Democrats have been
expecting some aspects of the report _ related to whether the
president lied in his deposition when he said he did not have
sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky _ to contain salacious details
of their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, the Rules Committee will deal with procedural issues.
The two sides are still discussing the powers that Hyde wants,
which include the ability to subpoena witnesses, grant them
immunity and enforce contempt charges against them. Democrats are
leery of what they have called extraordinary powers.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt appealed on Wednesday for the president and his lawyer
to have some time to respond to Starr's report before it was
released, and suggested in the meeting with Gingrich that it could
be 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich was noncommittal, according to congressional aides and
the Republicans were not expected to agree. But Democrats said they
believed Gingrich was striving to be nonpartisan.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the morning meeting in his office, Gingrich,
according to several congressional aides, lectured Democrats about
his own treatment when he was censured and fined $300,000 by the
House on ethic charges. But he said that despite his own searing
experience, he would protect the rights of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde on Wednesday vowed that, ``I will not condone, nor
participate in, a political witch hunt. If the evidence does not
justify a full impeachment investigation, I will not recommend one
to the House. However, if the evidence does justify an inquiry, I
will fulfill my oath of office and recommend a fuller inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr's report to Congress on Wednesday culminated years of
investigations into Clinton that began on Jan. 12, 1994, under
Robert B. Fiske, Jr., and then was continued by Starr, who was
named his successor as independent counsel by a three-judge panel
on Aug. 5, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Starr's inquiry has expanded from an
investigation of the Whitewater real estate deal, to controversies
over the White House dismissal of travel office aides, to the
suicide of Vincent Foster, a deputy White House counsel.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Starr began investigating allegations that Mr.
Clinton had had sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky, a White House
intern, then lied about it in a deposition in the sexual harassment
suit brought by Paula Jones.  &QL;

MICROSOFT SERVES SUBPOENAS ON 5 COMPUTER COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Corp. said Wednesday that it had served
subpoenas on five leading companies in the computer industry asking
them to supply information that would show they engage in business
practices similar to the practices at the heart of the federal
government's antitrust suit against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The subpoenas, which are so sweeping in scope that they could
delay the scheduled Sept. 23 start of the trial, were served last
Friday on IBM Corp., Netscape Communications Corp., Novell Inc.,
Oracle Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-page subpoenas request rafts of documents that would
show, among other things, whether companies colluded in the
continuing development of Unix, a powerful operating system widely
used on engineering work stations, Microsoft said.
</P>
<P>
   The subpoenas also seek to obtain information showing that some
of the companies worked together to develop new versions of Java, a
programing language developed by Sun, in order to compete more
effectively with Microsoft's Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Murray, a Microsoft spokesman, said the company decided to
issue the subpoenas late last week, after a U.S. District Court
judge ordered Microsoft to turn over more records requested by the
Justice Department. Government lawyers asked for the documents to
support evidence that Microsoft had pressured or bullied Intel
Corp., Apple Computer Inc. and Real Networks Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is to defend ourselves against these new charges,''
Murray said of the subpoenas of other companies' records. ``It's to
show that the government has a lack of understanding of how the
software industry works. All of Microsoft's competitors are doing
everything Microsoft is accused of doing.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases the subpoenas are so broad it is difficult to see
how the information can be gathered and analyzed in the days left
before the scheduled start of the antitrust trial on Sept. 23.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one request to Netscape, among many others, asks
for ``documents sufficient to show any suggested, planned,
proposed, considered, actual or abandoned effort by Netscape to
work with any other company (other than Microsoft) including but
not limited to Apple Computer Inc., IBM Corp., Novell Inc., Oracle
Corp., Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard Corp., Compaq Computer
Corp., on the development or marketing of any product or
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   A Netscape spokesman said, ``We are responding to the subpoena
and intend to respond in a timely manner.''

CLINTON ASKS FOR `FORGIVENESS' IN EMOTIONAL PLEA

<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Trying to save his presidency in its moment of
greatest peril, President Clinton on Wednesday asked for
forgiveness, and pledged to do everything possible to redeem the
trust of the American people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be honest with you; I want you to understand these
have been the toughest days of my life, but they may turn out to be
the most valuable for me and my family. And I have no one to blame
but myself for my self-inflicted wounds,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was trying for a third time to make amends since his
Aug. 17 national address in which he admitted to misleading
Americans for seven months about an inappropriate relationship with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks came on one of the bleakest days of his presidency,
just hours before independent counsel Kenneth Starr sent his report
on possible Clinton wrongdoings to Congress, and as the House
geared up for possible impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   His voice soft and halting in the darkened hotel ballroom,
Clinton told 350 supporters of Lt. Gov. Buddy MacKay that ``I have
been your friend, I've done my best to be your friend. But I also
let you down. And I let my family down, and I let this country
down. But I'm trying to make it right. And I am determined never to
let anything like that happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, his face grim, said, ``So I ask you for your
understanding, for your forgiveness on this journey we're on. I
hope you'll tell your friends and neighbors that I'm grateful, and
that I'm determined to redeem the trust of all the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Words that previously came hesitantly and reluctantly seemed to
flow easily as Clinton stood before the friendly crowd and gave a
speech that his aides and allies had urged him to make weeks
earlier. In the past, Clinton refused to directly apologize or ask
for forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said he was unaware, until after his address, of Starr's
surprise move to submit his report Wednesday afternoon, after
months of investigation into allegations of sex, perjury and
obstruction of justice at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   His address in Orlando came only hours after a similarly
emotional session with House Democratic leaders who met with the
president at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we saw was a father, a husband, the leader of our country
who was contrite. He was very sorry for his actions,'' said
Michigan Rep. David Bonior, the second-ranking House Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Although the president ``wants to carry on with the business of
the country,'' Bonior said, Clinton ``clearly understands, I think,
the deep pain he has caused his family, his colleagues, the people
he works with, members of Congress and the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonior said Clinton seemed near tears and was clearly struggling
with his apology. ``He felt the pain, and he felt it very
strongly,'' the lawmaker said. Clinton will hold similar sessions
today with Senate Democratic leaders and his Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   At the downtown Orlando hotel, Clinton spoke at length, without
prompting and in a far different tone than he had addressed the
issue before. MacKay's supporters responded with several standing
ovations. He told the crowd of his visit to nearby Hillcrest
Elementary School and of shaking the hands of students.
</P>
<P>
   ``And this kid that reminded me a lot of myself when I was that
young, he was bigger than the other students and kind of husky, he
said, `Mr. President, I want to grow up to be president. I want to
be a president like you.' And I said, I thought, I want to be able
to conduct my life and my presidency so that all the parents of the
country could feel good if their children were able to say that
again. I'll never forget that little boy, and it's a big guide for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   George Saunders, 65, of Orlando, said he expected an apology
from Clinton. ``I think he was very sincere. I think he realizes
the error of his ways.'' But Tim Perry, 28, a Republican attending
the luncheon with a friend, said, ``I think it's just him
posturing.''
</P>
<P>
   The president was greeted at the hotel by more than 50
demonstrators holdings signs calling for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, biting his lower lip, seemed genuinely moved after
MacKay, blistered by critics and editorials for keeping his
fund-raising date with Clinton, spoke of his friendship for the
president. Clinton attended a fund-raising luncheon and then flew
to Miami for two more fund-raising sessions.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay, an underdog against Republican Jeb Bush for the Florida
governor's post, said, ``Whenever this state has faced a crisis or
a challenge, you have been there for us, whether it's hurricanes or
whether it's tornadoes, or whether it's fires, or whether it's
floods. We've had them all and you have been there Mr. President.
We don't forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Before a blue banner proclaiming unity among Florida Democrats,
MacKay said, ``Martin Luther King once said that in the end, we
will remember not the words of our enemies but the silence of our
friends. Mr. President, we are not going to be silent. We are going
to speak out in support of the work you are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   His remarks, met with applause, prompted Clinton to respond,
``you have been astonishingly kind and generous to me today, and I
will never forget it. If God let's me live to be an old man, I will
never forget what Buddy MacKay said today from this platform, where
he could have said nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Florida Democrats, including Sen. Bob Graham, moved in
recent days to distance themselves from Clinton. Graham last week
called Clinton's misconduct ``an irreversible stain'' on his
presidency. Democrats have harshly criticized Clinton's behavior
since Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., denounced the president's
conduct as ``immoral.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton still made a political pitch, saying his conduct should
not be held against Democrats during the November elections.
``There are a whole lot of people, in Washington especially or who
write about this who ... would like for something going on in
Washington to be the subject of an election in November, instead of
what's going on in the lives of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
STORY CAN END HERE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton helped the cash-strapped MacKay raise $1 million at one
event in Orlando and two in Miami. Bush has raised nearly three
times as much as MacKay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly a political gamble I wouldn't have taken if I
were in MacKay's position,'' said Tom Slade, chairman of the
Florida Republican Party. The party's headquarters in Tallahassee
had a sign taunting MacKay: ``Don't Worry Buddy, Everything Will Be
Impeachy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to allow, as the national party, Clinton to
enjoy a moment's peace. It may be that we don't have to do anything
at all. I bet the Starr report is going to be rough enough that all
we have to do is hold a copy of it up,'' Slade said.

BOURQUE AGREES TO TWO-YEAR PACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Bruins and five of their unsigned Group 2 free
agents have been haggling all summer over contracts without any
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   That made Wednesday's development all the more remarkable. It
took less than an hour for the club to reach a two-year agreement
worth an estimated $10 million with captain Ray Bourque, who's not
even a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque, 37, who is entering his 20th National Hockey League
season, had said he would wait until the end of this year, when his
current pact was to expire, to decide if he would play longer.
However, Bourque decided over the summer break that he wanted to
play an extra year. President-general manager Harry Sinden and
assistant GM Mike O'Connell sat down with the defenseman and his
representative, Steve Freyer, Wednesday afternoon and hammered out
a deal, ripping up Bourque's current $3.5 million contract in favor
of a deal that runs through 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were pretty well prepared to go along with what Ray wanted
because we knew it would be reasonable,'' said Sinden. ``He was
very reasonable, and when Ray is reasonable, I melt. We had a
proposal and they had a proposal and we were very close without
even knowing before what the other wanted. So we took his.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not one of Ray's contracts has ever gone to its conclusion.
He'd fall behind (in the salary market), and it was just not fair
compared to a lot of others, so we'd adjust it and Ray was always
reasonable. He never tried to take the quantum leap as if he was a
free agent. He's the best defenseman in the league and has
sometimes been the best player in the league and he's surrounded by
mediocre players making more money. He's always fair. He just
wanted to be treated with the times a little bit more. I respect
the way he approached it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden said Bourque wouldn't rule out playing longer than the
next two years but wasn't ready to discuss such a possibility.
Bourque will see how it goes this season, and the sides could talk
about adding to the deal either a year from now or perhaps even
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Sinden believes one reason Bourque wanted to extend his career
is that he is having so much fun as a leader of the young Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's really relishing his role as mentor,'' said
Sinden. ``I think he likes that, being the go-to guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque said when he and Freyer went into the meeting, they
didn't expect to come out with a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't know how it was going to go,'' said Bourque.
``I was very surprised walking out of there. I was hoping it would
be done and I was hoping it would be quick, but rarely do you walk
out of there with a deal (in that span). Harry's tough to deal with
when it comes down to these things because he's very good at what
he does. But he responded very well. I left there very pleased. All
along, I've said this is where I want to play. I've always said
this is where I want it to end. It's going to end in Boston and I'm
very happy about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden is holding out hope that Bourque will continue his career
indefinitely, even joking that he will have to put off his own
retirement to coincide with Bourque's. But Bourque believes the
1999-2000 season will be it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's another contract, I'd be very surprised,'' he said.
``But two years ago, I was thinking the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden is optimistic that two of what he calls his ``Gang of
Five'' will come to agreements. He received a proposal from the
representative for forward Steve Heinze and planned to review it
last night, believing it will be resolved. He feels forward Ted
Donato is also close to signing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both have a good chance of getting done by Saturday,'' Sinden
said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rookie camp opened Wednesday at Ristuccia Center in Wilmington,
with the young players going through physical testing as well as an
on-ice workout. Coach Pat Burns said it was a typical first day.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to get too excited about rookie camp sometimes
because they're playing amongst a certain level of talent,'' said
Burns, who watched from up above. ``When they get into the bigger
talent, sometimes they disappear. We'll evaluate them as we see it
here, but don't wait for any great comments about these players
because everybody came into camp in real good shape, which is a
real good sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Rookie camp runs through Saturday. Veterans report for physicals
that day and begin practice Sunday.

   Clinton helped the cash-strapped MacKay raise $1 million at one
event in Orlando and two in Miami. Bush has raised nearly three
times as much as MacKay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly a political gamble I wouldn't have taken if I
were in MacKay's position,'' said Tom Slade, chairman of the
Florida Republican Party. The party's headquarters in Tallahassee
had a sign taunting MacKay: ``Don't Worry Buddy, Everything Will Be
Impeachy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to allow, as the national party, Clinton to
enjoy a moment's peace. It may be that we don't have to do anything
at all. I bet the Starr report is going to be rough enough that all
we have to do is hold a copy of it up,'' Slade said.

RAFTER, WILLIAMS ADVANCE

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jonas Bjorkman jumped on Patrick Rafter's first serve
and ripped a winner for the first point of their US Open
quarterfinal match Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   And the rest was all Rafter. Well, almost all Rafter.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter served well. Volleyed well. Passed well. Tossed in an
occasional drop shot. And basically blasted Bjorkman, his doubles
partner, out of the tournament, 6-2, 6-3, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter moved a step closer to retaining his US Open title as he
advanced to a semifinal meeting with the winner of last night's
match between top seed Pete Sampras and No. 9 Karol Kucera.
</P>
<P>
   In women's quarterfinal matches, No. 5 seed Venus Williams
roared back to beat 1994 Open champion Arantxa Sanchez Vicario,
2-6, 6-1, 6-1, and gained a semifinal berth opposite No. 2 seed
Lindsay Davenport, who knocked out No. 13 Amanda Coetzer, 6-0, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport beat Williams in three sets in the quarterfinals at
the Australian Open, and they have split two matches since then.
</P>
<P>
   Williams made bundles of unforced errors in the first set and
eliminated them in the next two _ she had 18 in the first set, 17
in the final two combined _ in an impressive display. French Open
champion Sanchez Vicario was able to hold serve only once in each
of the last two sets.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez Vicario was serving at 15-40 when Williams finished her
off with a powerful backhand down the line.
</P>
<P>
   Against Rafter, Bjorkman, one of the best at return of service
in the game, played pretty well in the windy and chilly weather. He
just could do little with Rafter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I had to change too much because of the
conditions,'' Bjorkman said. ``I had to change because Pat was
playing too good in the beginning. You know, I was trying to come
in a lot. But he surprisingly was returning and his passing shots
were working better than I have ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafter had to agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't play much better than that, I don't think,'' he said.
``Just volleyed very well, served very well ... I could go on.
Yeah, it was a great day for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Only in one game in the first two sets did Bjorkman come close
to breaking Rafter's serve. And in that one, Rafter quickly dug out
of the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter broke Bjorkman in the seventh game of the third set and
served for 5-3. Finally, Bjorkman broke. But three games later,
Rafter broke again and led, 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   Bjorkman had a couple of game points, first at 40-30 and again
after surviving a Rafter break, but could not hold off the
Australian.
</P>
<P>
   And that hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know,'' Bjorkman said. ``You have to fight all the
way in. Sometimes you get the third set. You never know _ you could
turn around everything. He played on a level, you know, that I
think is his best. If he would have lost the third, you never know,
he could have had a letdown and it's a match again.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rafter broke Bjorkman for the final time, then served out
the match.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter had a rough start to this tournament. He was down two
sets to Hicham Arazi in the first round before rallying to pull out
the match, 4-6, 4-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-1. He has lost only one set in the
four matches since.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter also had a rough start to the season. He lost in the
third round of the Australian Open, in the first round of three
tournaments heading into the French Open, and in the second there.
At Wimbledon, he got to the fourth round before losing to Tim
Henman.
</P>
<P>
   He took a couple of weeks off after that, adjusted his attitude,
and decided to have a little more fun and work on taking off some
of the pressure he had been putting on himself to match his results
of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Then he started to roll.
</P>
<P>
   He won the Canadian Open and came back to beat Sampras in the
final at Cincinnati after losing the first set.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, the first six months were pretty slow for me,'' Rafter
said. ``The second six months have been very, very rewarding.''

 &HT;    `I ask you for your ... forgiveness'
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ A contrite President Clinton made his most
clear-cut apology yet for the Monica Lewinsky affair Wednesday,
saying he has ``let this country down'' and is ``determined to
redeem the trust of all the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing a crowd of fellow Democrats at a Florida political
fund-raiser, Clinton spoke on the topic for more than a minute in
serious, hushed tones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been your friend, but I have also let you down,''
Clinton said. ``I let my family down. I let this country down. I'm
trying to make that right. I'm determined to never let that happen
again.''
</P>
<P>
   While never mentioning Lewinsky by name, the president thanked
the crowd for their support during what he called ``the toughest
days of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask you for your understanding and forgiveness,'' he said,
drawing loud applause.
</P>
<P>
   The speech was a sharp departure in tone and substance from the
brief, televised address Clinton made to the nation Aug. 17 after
his testimony before the grand jury investigating whether he lied
about his relationship with Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   In that speech, Clinton came off as defiant, saying the incident
was private. He was sharply critical of independent counsel Kenneth
Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made no mention of Starr on Wednesday, but did warn that
``there are a whole lot of people who would like for this to be the
subject of the election in November instead of what's going on in
Americans' lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be fooled,'' he said. ``Elections are about you and your
children and our future.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Clinton met at the White House with top
Democrats, who said Clinton was remorseful.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to carry on with the business of the country, but he
clearly understands, I think, the deep pain he has caused his
family, his colleagues, the people he works with, members of
Congress and the country,'' said Rep. David Bonior of Michigan,
second-ranking Democrat in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Bonior said there was no discussion of impeachment or
resignation. ``I think the president will certainly be able to
continue in office,'' he told reporters after the 90-minute meeting
with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Bonior said the meeting was very emotional and it was clear
``that he felt the pain, and he felt it very strongly. ... What we
saw was a father, a husband, the leader of our country, who was
contrite, who was very sorry for his actions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orlando speech seemed to satisfy some in the audience,
although a number of Democrats said they still weren't sure they
could again give Clinton their unqualified trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was moved by his sincerity and his words,'' said Doug
Leonard, an Orlando architect who attended the $500-a-plate
luncheon. ``I don't think the first speech went far enough. But
would I vote for him again if he were running for his second term?
I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   In Orlando, Clinton also visited Hillcrest Elementary, an
inner-city school that has been cited as a model for its
multicultural programs and success in raising the test scores of
disadvantaged children.
</P>
<P>
   The president made no mention of the Lewinsky matter there.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, though, he met several pupils, one of whom, a young
boy, told him he wanted to grow up to be president, ``just like
you.''
</P>
<P>
   At the fund-raising luncheon, Clinton recalled meeting the boy,
saying he wanted to ``conduct my life and my presidency'' so that
all parents would want their children to grow up with that same
ambition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never forget that boy,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Just how far the president's latest apology will go toward
regaining the country's trust remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Among the crowd at Hillcrest Elementary was Sandy Osteen of
Inverness, a lifelong Democrat and former teacher who is active in
education issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted for him, but I think he should resign,'' Osteen said.
``I lost faith in him when he lied to us. He has lost all his
credibility. It hurts, it really hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd and Louise Craver also heard Clinton's speech at the
Orlando school. Todd Craver, a salesman, is a Republican. His wife,
an architect, is a Democrat who voted for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't vote for him again,'' said Louise Craver. ``But I
don't think he should be impeached. I don't think anybody should
lose their job over marital infidelity. Anybody would lie about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd Craver blamed the news media for hyping the story
endlessly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he was lying about nuclear detente or issues of
international importance, that's one thing,'' Craver said. ``But
not an affair with a young lady. The media is going to make the job
of president impossible to hold.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the hotel where Clinton attended the luncheon, about 50
protesters held up signs blasting the president and calling for him
to resign. ``The guy's gotta go,'' said Gene McDonald, a
small-business owner in Boca Raton. ``The criminality of this guy
has gone on for years.''

 &HT;    Prosecutor sends Congress his case against president
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman and Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- In what constitutes the most serious legal threat
to a president since Watergate, independent counsel Kenneth Starr
submitted a report to Congress on Wednesday that could trigger
impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   And the public soon may learn what is in the sealed report.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Gerald Solomon (R-N.Y.), chairman of the House Rules
Committee, said 445 pages of Starr's report could be made available
to members of Congress _ and through them to the public _ as soon
as Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Starr spokesman Charles Bakaly said the materials contain
``substantial and credible information that may constitute grounds
for impeachment of the president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   David Kendall, Clinton's private lawyer, dismissed the
suggestion that the president has done anything to warrant
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The documents represent only the prosecutor's allegations,''
Kendall said in a brief statement outside the White House. ``We do
know this: There is no basis for impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   After a review by lawyers and members of the House Judiciary
Committee, the House may decide to begin a formal inquiry into
impeachment or, finding nothing, drop the matter altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans vowed, in Rep. Henry Hyde's words, to avoid ``a
political witch hunt.'' The Illinois Republican, chairman of the
Judiciary Committee, said he would be happy to keep his committee
on the job beyond Congress' scheduled adjournment in early October.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, too, called for proceeding fairly. ``We need to take
a long hard look and that's why we can't rush to judgment,'' said
Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), one of Clinton's most loyal supporters in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But on a day dominated early by speculation about when the
report would be sent, followed by Starr's surprise delivery of it
in the afternoon, no one on Capitol Hill knew precisely what would
happen next, for two reasons:
</P>
<P>
   First, the House must decide how to deal with the report.
</P>
<P>
   Second, no one in Congress has had a look at it.
</P>
<P>
   Even Starr recommended that parts of the report and supporting
documents be kept confidential, since they contain ``information of
a personal nature.''
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich, talking to reporters several hours
before Starr's staff delivered the report, said: ``No one would
have access to that material until the House has passed a
resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich and Hyde pledged to make as much of the report public
as quickly as possible, although both cautioned that some personal
material would be kept private. Wilson Livingood, the House of
Representatives' sergeant-at-arms, took possession of the report
and box after box of supporting evidence after two unmarked vans
from the independent counsel's office drove onto the Capitol
grounds at 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   In a made-for-television moment that underscored the seriousness
of the situation, U.S. Capitol Police officers cordoned off an area
in front of the Capitol where the vans waited with their secret
cargo.
</P>
<P>
   Under the watchful eyes of scores of reporters, tourists and
even some members of Congress, police officers spent 10 minutes
transferring 36 boxes containing two complete copies of the report
and documentation from the vans to two sport utility vehicles,
which were then transported to the nearby Ford Office Building.
</P>
<P>
   The report is under around-the-clock armed guard in a small room
in that building until the House decides how to deal with it, said
Sgt. Dan Nicholls, spokesman for the Capitol police.
</P>
<P>
   William Jefferson Clinton would be the first president to face a
serious threat of impeachment since Richard Nixon in 1974. Nixon
resigned Aug. 9, 1974, after the House Judiciary Committee voted
articles of impeachment against him, but before the full House
acted.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.), one of Clinton's fiercest critics in
Congress, joined the crowd watching the transfer of the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a constitutional crisis. It's a very sober time,'' Barr
said.
</P>
<P>
   On the Senate floor, Democrat Robert Byrd of West Virginia
called Clinton's behavior ``a sorrowful spectacle'' and rejected
Clinton's assertion that it was a private matter.
</P>
<P>
   He compared Clinton's strategy of ``delay, delay, delay and
counterattack'' to the response by Nixon in Watergate. ``We seem to
be living history all over again,'' Byrd said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the veteran lawmaker and informal historian of the
Senate urged that the nation ``pause and reflect'' and allow the
House to decide the next move. He said he had reached no conclusion
about whether Clinton should be censured or impeached, and he said
censure was a live option.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting this thing behind us is not going to be an easy thing
to do,'' Byrd said. ``It is going to be a traumatic experience for
all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel has spent more than four years and $40
million investigating a wide range of allegations, including
whether Clinton had a role in a failed land deal in Arkansas,
misused his authority in obtaining FBI files on Republicans and
abused the travel office of the White Houe.
</P>
<P>
   But the inquiry into the president's personal relationship with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky sparked more controversy,
to say nothing of salacious details, than the others combined.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde praised Starr for persisting despite intense criticism.
``Mr. Starr belongs in the pantheon of saints,'' the congressman
said.
</P>
<P>
   The afternoon drama in front of the Capitol capped a most
unusual day in Washington and came without warning.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt and other House Democrats
started their day at the White House, listening to Clinton
apologize for his actions. Then Gephardt hurried back to the
Capitol where he met with Gingrich, Hyde and others to discuss how
to handle Starr's report.
</P>
<P>
   Stressing the need for bipartisanship, Gephardt said, ``Next to
declaring war, this may be the most important thing that we do so
we have to do it right. ``
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt called on Congress to give Clinton a chance to respond
to the report, a suggestion Gingrich neither embraced nor
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisan meeting of House leaders also produced a decision
to have Judiciary Committee staff members call Starr's office to
find out what might be coming, and when. It was the first official
contact between Congress and the independent counsel's office.
</P>
<P>
   Before the day was out, there would be much more.

 &HT;    Security for Starr report is high-tech
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A drab, six-story government office building that
once housed the FBI's fingerprint files became on Wednesday the
safe depository for independent counsel Ken Starr's report on
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Starr's office signed over the 36 boxes of
documents to House Sergeant-at-arms Bill Livingood outside the
Capitol, Capitol police transported the evidence to the Ford House
Office Building five blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   Situated on the outskirts of the Capitol complex and next to one
of the main interstate arteries out of Washington, the Ford
Building is home to a half-dozen unrelated legislative service
offices but no members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Room 186, where the legal-sized boxes of material are being
kept, lies off a long corridor on the ground floor. Three Capitol
Police officers were standing watch in the corridor Wednesday
evening, blocking access to any visitors.
</P>
<P>
   At least one police officer will stand guard 24 hours a day,
said Kerri Hanley, spokeswoman for the House sergeant-at-arms.
``It's a secured room,'' Hanley said, declining to elaborate on the
security setup.
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorker reported in its current issue that those entering
the room will need two combinations, one to unlock the door and one
to disable a motion-detecting alarm system. There will be separate
codes for majority and minority staff of the House Judiciary
Committee, the article said, so that each side can access the room
and read the report.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.), a member of the Judiciary Committee, said
he was unaware of the security arrangement. But he said concerns
about security should propel Congress to make Starr's findings
public as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer it sits around, the greater the risk that parts of
it get selectively leaked,'' Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   Until the House votes on the procedural issue of how to handle
the report, only Sergeant-at-arms Livingood will be permitted
inside the room where the documents are being kept, Hanley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our role at this point is just to wait for direction from the
House,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1939 by the FBI to house the bureau's fingerprint
archives, the Ford Building was acquired by Congress in 1975 from
the General Services Administration.
</P>
<P>
   It was renamed the Gerald R. Ford House of Representatives
Office Building in 1990 pursuant to a House resolution.

 &HT;    Mac steps up just when we need him
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   That Bill Clinton is the luckiest guy. Just after he has to face
the music on national television, his old pal Boris Yeltsin needs
help, and he takes refuge in Moscow. Then, when his own Democrats
bail out on him and it looks as if there's no place to hide, here
comes Mark David McGwire and the home-run love-in in St. Louis.
There's no room on the front page or the nightly news for a
president with an 0-2 count on him. The home run takes precedence
over philandering, and America is off chasing a new hero.
</P>
<P>
   Just when it needs him, the defenders of right and decency have
one to clutch to their bosom. Strong, virile, loving papa, even if
he does resemble a red-bearded Bluto.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark McGwire is so strong he has driven Monica Lewinsky all
the way back to page 22,'' Paul Harvey said with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   What we have witnessed is an American phenomenon. No one person
has held the country captive for such a stretch as McGwire. This,
the man the Oakland A's traded away for three pitchers you could
buy off the rack, and no place needs an attraction worse than
Oakland. Not only were we able to feast on McGwire, but we got a
double dip, with Sammy Sosa in St. Louis, too.
</P>
<P>
   Thank heaven, here were two guys you didn't have to apologize
for. I could name a half-dozen who'd have turned Americans off,
just as they turned us on, but this is no time for Bonding and
Belleing. If McGwire and Sosa were faking their mutual admiration,
then both deserve Oscars. The very sight of Sosa standing in the
outfield applauding his rival's home run seemed to say it all.
</P>
<P>
   It was a great hour for the American family, the McGwires and
the Marises, all that hugging and kissing and high-fiving. Several
have asked why I wasn't there. I saw much more poised with my
clicker than I would have seen in St. Louis. How do you describe
one more home run, although the one that broke Roger Maris' record
was the weakest of them all. However, I must say that if I'd heard
Joe Buck say one more time, ``On this historic night for baseball
in St. Louis,'' I might have ordered a stomach pump.
</P>
<P>
   There was something symbolic about the track of No. 62, barely
clearing the fence in the left-field corner, in that it probably
prevented mayhem in the bleachers. There were people willing to
sacrifice life and limb to bag the record-breaker. Instead, the
prize went to a humble member of the grounds crew at Busch Stadium.
The ball I want is the last one McGwire hits this year. That will
be the real record-breaker.
</P>
<P>
   There are detractors. ``He hits mistakes,'' Leo Mazzone said.
``Any batter can be pitched to, but the pitch that gets away is the
one he hits.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves proved his point. They served McGwire only two
home-run pitches, and the second was like batting practice. Dennis
Martinez's fastball is 43 years old, and when he fed McGwire two in
a row, it was like a gift. The big man hit the pitch so far it
might have hit the old Stan Musial statue if something hadn't got
in the way.
</P>
<P>
   Now, about this ``outside agent'' that McGwire uses, the
unpronounceable name that starts with ``A.'' That's out of my
precinct. I don't know enough about it to speak of it. I do know
that it's banned in some games, including the National Football
League, which once upon a time banned nothing, including TNT. It
apparently develops muscle power, but I doubt it improves the
batting eye. And Bud Selig is in no position to ban anything.
McGwire and Sosa both are good and decent men. No role models in
jeopardy here.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it is a scintillating moment in sports, not, as some radio
babbler said the other day, ``The biggest event in American
history.'' It is to be fondled and coddled in memory, another
mountain climbed, another achievement to file away. I had to
chortle when I.J. Rosenberg, the Gabriel Heatter of sports radio,
exhilarating over it all, cried out at the end of his monologue,
``God bless America!''
</P>
<P>
   God bless baseball. God knows, it needs it. And God bless Kate
Smith, too.

 &HT;    Seanez sits while nursing arm injury
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Montreal _ There's a reason John Rocker was pitching Monday to a
succession of right-handed Mets batters in the eighth inning before
Edgardo Alfonzo hit a two-out, two-run, game-winning home run. Rudy
Seanez couldn't pitch then, and still can't now, due to a slight
muscle tear in his right forearm.
</P>
<P>
   Seanez injured himself Saturday in New York, while working the
eighth inning when he gave up a two-out, two-run, game-winning
homer to Tony Phillips. It wasn't any one pitch that did it. ``I
really didn't feel that bad when I was pitching,'' said Seanez,
who's since been taking ultrasound treatment on his arm.
``Afterward was when it started tightening up. That's when I
started getting concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Seanez was checked Sunday by Braves trainers Dave Pursley and
Jeff Porter, who performed a series of strength tests and diagnosed
the slight muscle tear. ``He'll be all right for October,'' Pursley
said. ``Maybe by the time we get home (Friday, a six-game homestand
against Florida and Philadelphia). I don't think it's a profuse
tear, more a little fiber.''
</P>
<P>
   Seanez will be examined in Atlanta by team orthopedist Joe
Chandler. For now, manager Bobby Cox said, ``He can't pitch.'' In
other words, it hurts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still a little soreness and tightness,'' said Seanez.
I'd rather be careful and it's better to be safe right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Seanez said it will be ``a few more days'' before he can throw
again. Called up May 30 from Richmond, Seanez had become the
Braves' most dominant reliever in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Health watch
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Walt Weiss, who hasn't played since Aug. 31 and took a
cortisone shot the next day for his chronically strained left
quadriceps, will probably return to the lineup during this
homestand. ``It feels good,'' Weiss said. ``I haven't tested it as
far as running hard on it. I can usually tell a lot by pressing it
on my own. As far as that goes, it feels good.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Weiss will be cautious and sat out again Wednesday.
``It's kind of like we've got the shot to get me healthy for the
final stretch,'' he said. ``It's been eight days.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Lockhart, meanwhile, continues to nurse his chronically
strained right hamstring. The second baseman had missed five games
since coming out of a Sept. 1 game against Houston in the fifth
inning before he was used as a pinch-hitter Tuesday. Lockhart
struck out and was thrown out 2-3 when he couldn't run all-out to
first. On Wednesday, he said, ``It actually feels real good
today.''

 &HT;    Holyfield provides preview in fight for fans
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You follow Evander Holyfield, you see the world. The electric
canyons of Las Vegas. The grimy shore of Atlantic City. The teeming
streets of New York City. The Chick-fil-A at the CNN Center.
</P>
<P>
   Seizing the home-food-court advantage, Holyfield brought his
training to the people Wednesday afternoon. They swept aside a few
tables and chairs from the floor of the CNN Center, erected a
last-minute ring and invited the lunch-goers to stop and enjoy a
little sweat _ free refills! _ with their gyro wraps. The
heavyweight champeen of the world stretched and skipped rope and
sparred six rounds in this most unusual setting in order to drive
home this important message to the citizens of Atlanta:
</P>
<P>
   BUY SOME TICKETS, ALREADY.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Las Vegas, all you see are the big-money people,'' said
Holyfield, who is trying on the role of pugilistic populist for his
Sept. 19 fight against Vaughn Bean at the Georgia Dome. ``But
there's a lot of other people who are interested. You shouldn't
have to give up a house payment or a car payment to see a fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Appealing to the pocketbook of the locals is always a good idea.
At $25 for the cheap seats, the Georgia Dome ranks as a very large
boxing outlet mall. Opera glasses not included.
</P>
<P>
   Giving the people a little free taste of the Holyfield
Experience was a nice gesture. It served as a clear alarm that Don
King really is coming to town. Much of a boxer's training is as
exciting to watch as The Mulching Channel, but there were times he
and sparring partner Gary Bell got fairly real. ``When the lights
come on and the people show up, it has a way of turning him on,''
Bell said. ``I know I better get ready.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a real enough boxing event to at least deserve its own
working title. We'll call Wednesday ``The Photo Op by the Turner
Shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Any commotion is a good thing, because boxing in this town tends
to create all the buzz of a one-legged cricket.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket sales are floating near the 15,000 level, which might not
sound like a lot within the wide open spaces of the Georgia Dome.
But Holyfield considers the smaller venues of his game and reasons,
``We would have already sold Las Vegas out.''
</P>
<P>
   You've got to love the man's unwavering confidence and focus. It
is no less than the kind that saw Mark McGwire through his little
trial by mass hysteria. Watching a new home-run record Tuesday
night, Holyfield brought some of that event's lessons back with him
to the ring. ``A man is measured by how much pressure he can
bear,'' he said. ``You can't imprison yourself with self-doubt.
You've got to have confidence in whatever you do.''
</P>
<P>
   That outlook is why Holyfield can pull off a fight that ranges
so near his home and so far away from his routine. That's why he
can say of the Atlanta experiment, ``How can it fail?'' All that,
plus the fact it's only Vaughn Bean.
</P>
<P>
   If you take the temperature of this fight by how many were
willing to loiter in an atrium to watch a free workout, then there
is some gathering interest in Holyfield-Bean. About 1,000 or so
watched in respectful quietude while the champ worked up a lather.
``More people came to see this than go to some fights,'' Holyfield
said, apparently well pleased.
</P>
<P>
   A person could get used to this. It's no Vegas, but where else
can you watch the heavyweight champion train and get Blimpie-to-go
for the ride home.

 &HT;    ACC NOTES
 &HT;    By Norman Arey and Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEMSON vs. Virginia Tech, Saturday, 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Clemson's special teams put in sterling performances in
Saturday's 33-0 romp over Furman. Antwan Edwards returned a punt 39
yards, Adrian Dingle blocked a punt and placekicker David
Richardson hit all four field-goal attempts.... Former Tiger
tailback Lamont Pegues returns to Death Valley, albeit as a starter
in Virginia Tech's backfield. Pegues led Clemson with 390 yards
rushing in his freshman season of 1994 but made way the following
year to eventual career rushing leader Raymond Priester,
transferring almost immediately. Pegues has declined interview
requests this week from South Carolina media outlets.... Reserve
linebacker Warren Lott was denied admission and has been granted a
release.
</P>
<P>
   DUKE at Northwestern, Saturday, 12:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   True freshman B.J. Hill, a 5-11, 205-pound strong safety, moved
to tailback last week in the Blue Devils' opening win over Western
Carolina and gained 121 yards. Now Hill wants to move back to
safety after being forced to step in because of injuries to regular
TB starters Letavious Wilks and Duane Epperson. Coach Fred
Goldsmith says that Hill needs to hold on a minute. ``Both Wilks
and Epperson are back at practice, and that gives us a little more
flexibility,'' Goldsmith said, ``but for right now, we're going to
keep developing B.J Hill at tailback.'' ... Goldsmith's team plays
at Northwestern, a team that came back to take a 24-20 win last
season. Goldsmith says he knows what to expect.''This is a big Big
10 team. We don't match up too well in size.''
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA STATE at N.C. State, Saturday, 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles are concerned with N.C. State receiver Torry Holt
heading into Saturday's ACC opener against the Wolfpack. Holt had
an ACC-record five touchdown receptions in last season's loss to
the Seminoles. ``You better know where he is,'' Florida State coach
Bobby Bowden said. ``They hide him, move him around, put him in
motion, and I don't blame them. He's a tremendous threat.'' Holt's
five-touchdown performance feat was a first against a
Bowden-coached team. ``We've never had anybody come close to doing
what Holt did last year,'' Bowden said. ``If somebody catches two
on us, that's a big event. We never had anybody catch five.'' ...
Bowden said that linebacker Brian Allen and noseguard Larry Smith
probably won't play because of injury.
</P>
<P>
   MARYLAND at Virginia, Saturday, noon, Media One-Channel 33
</P>
<P>
   Tailback LaMont Jordan, who didn't play Saturday as he continued
to recover from a nagging knee injury, should be ready to go
against Virginia. Coach Ron Vanderlinden said he held out Jordan
because of a lack of practice time and that he's ``at full speed
now.'' Harold Westley started in Jordan's place, gaining 68 yards
in 20 carries in the 23-15 win over James Madison.... LB Eric
Barton had a monstrous second quarter in that game, demonstrating
why he's the Terps' best All-ACC hope. He had two sacks, two
tackles and recovered a fumble, returning it 16 yards to set up a
field goal.... The opener at Byrd Stadium was played before a crowd
of 36,547, the biggest at home for Maryland since the 1995 season
finale.
</P>
<P>
   NORTH CAROLINA at Stanford, Sept. 19
</P>
<P>
   With starting quarterback Oscar Davenport out with a knee injury
that required arthroscopic surgery and a shocking loss to Miami of
Ohio, North Carolina coach Carl Torbush says he's glad his team has
a weekend off. ``It's probably good we had an open date,'' he said.
``At first I didn't like it, but after the defeat and the number of
injuries, I think it's a good idea.'' True freshman Ronald Curry,
one of the most-soughtrecruits in the nation in both football and
basketball, is the starter, while freshman Luke Huard and sophomore
Kevin Carty are listed as backups. Atlanta native Ronnie Robinson,
a 6-3, 240-pound fullback, will open at tailback against Stanford
next week because Rufus Brown and Ravon Anderson are fighting
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   N.C. STATE vs. Florida State, Saturday, 3:30 p.m., WSB
</P>
<P>
   Head coach Mike O'Cain normally doesn't have a quick temper, but
he angrily denounced a headline in Wednesday's Tallahassee Democrat
that suggested that the Seminoles would try to injure Wolfpack WR
Torry Holt, who set an ACC record with five TD receptions against
them last year in a 48-35 loss. ``That's a baldfaced lie,'' O'Cain
said. ``I have no fear of Florida State trying to do that. What I
said was that they may try to take him out of the game defensively
with their schemes, but that's all.'' In the story, O'Cain drew
reference to FSU's defense last year, which knocked out nine
opposing quarterbacks. ``They play on the edge,'' O'Cain said.
``They play as close to the edge as you can get. Sometimes it's
past the edge. That's where we have to count on the officials that
it doesn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   VIRGINIA vs. Maryland, Saturday, noon, Media One-Channel 33
</P>
<P>
   After last week's array of upsets in the ACC, it looks as if the
Cavaliers might be the second-best team in the league after Florida
State. The Wahoos take on hapless Maryland this weekend and George
Welsh, of course, is singing the blues. Welsh has spent the entire
week warning his Cavs not to let down after opening with a 19-0 win
over Auburn. Now ranked No. 12, Virginia should have no problem
with Maryland, a team it has beaten six years in a row. Maryland
tailback LaMont Jordan didn't play last week against James Madison,
but Welsh says he expects to see him. ...Starting fullback Anthony
Southern and defensive back Antwan Harris won't play against
Maryland because of hamstring injuries.
</P>
<P>
   WAKE FOREST vs. Navy, today, 8 p.m., ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   In last week's stunning 42-0 loss to Air Force, the Deacons had
a complete breakdown in their kicking game. The Deacons had a
kickoff downed at their one-yard line, a punt fumbled into the end
zone recovered by Air Force for a touchdown and a punt blocked for
a Falcon touchdown. ``Thank goodness, we were able to come home and
practice immediately,'' coach Jim Caldwell said. ``We had hard
practices both Sunday and Monday, and thank goodness, we're going
to be able to play (today) and won't have to wait.'' Wake was
supposed to be the most improved team in the ACC, and many people
had predicted that the Deacons might win as many as eight games.
Sports Illustrated had picked Caldwell's team as the No. 22 team in
the country.

 &HT;    SEC Notes
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart and Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALABAMA vs. Vanderbilt, Saturday, 12:30 p.m., ESPN
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Antoine Hunter, who is nursing a sprained ankle, is
playing ``about 90 percent,'' coach Mike DuBose said. Hunter is
expected to start Saturday's game against Vanderbilt. Also
available will be Hunter's backup, Kecalf Bailey. ... After
watching running back Shaun Alexander score a school-record five
touchdowns against BYU, Alabama coaches are trying to find more
ways to get him the ball. ``We've got a lot more stuff than we did
(against BYU),'' quarterbacks coach Charlie Stubbs said. ``We've
got a lot more wrinkles.'' ... DuBose said his goal is for
Alexander to touch the ball 25-30 times a game. ... Alabama has won
13 straight games over Vanderbilt. ... Punter Daniel Pope will now
hold on field goals and extra points, replacing Chris Reier.
</P>
<P>
   ARKANSAS vs. SMU, Sept. 19
</P>
<P>
   The running game is back for Arkansas, which gained 279 yards on
the ground in the opening win over Southwest Louisiana. That's
roughly 45 percent the ground output from all of last season. Chrys
Chukwuma gobbled up 132 yards rushing, the second-highest total by
an SEC back last week behind Tennessee's Jamal Lewis. And TB Madre
Hill, playing in his first game since the 1995 SEC championship
game, was good for 73 yards on nine carries and a TD, although he
fumbled twice. ... All-SEC DT candidate Melvin Bradley did not play
for academic reasons, and his status for next Saturday's game
against SMU depends on passing a correspondence course, head coach
Houston Nutt said. Bradley has led the Hogs in tackles each of the
last two years.
</P>
<P>
   AUBURN at Mississippi, Saturday, 3:30 p.m., Fox SS
</P>
<P>
   After rushing for only 18 yards on 27 carries against Virginia,
the Tigers plan some changes on the offensive line before
Saturday's game with Mississippi. Tim Castro, a transfer from
Georgia Tech, will replace DeMarcus Curry at guard. ... After
reviewing film of the 19-0 loss to Virginia, coach Terry Bowden
said he did not give sophomore quarterback Ben Leard enough passing
plays in the game plan. ``Maybe I played not to lose, rather than
to win,'' Bowden said. ... Sophomore running back Demontray Carter
is already in the doghouse. Carter injured his ankle eight days
before the opening game but did not attend his therapy sessions
regularly. Carter reinjured the ankle early in the Virginia game
and had only 17 yards in seven carries. Freshman Michael Burks will
start Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA vs. NE Louisiana, Saturday, 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Palmer will remain the starting quarterback, but junior
Doug Johnson was throwing without pain this week and said his
shoulder was ``85-90 percent (healthy).'' Johnson may get some
snaps against Northeast Louisiana. ... Junior center Ryan Kalich,
who sat out last week's win over The Citadel with a broken foot,
will try to get in a few plays Saturday. Starting center Corey
Yarbrough is out four to six weeks with a sprained left knee. Zac
Zedalis, normally a guard, will start at center. ... Safeties Teako
Brown and Rod Graddy will return to the lineup after sitting out a
one-game suspension for missing classes. ... Last week safety
Lester Norwood of Marietta became the first freshmen defensive back
to start for the Gators since Larry Kennedy in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   KENTUCKY vs. Eastern Kentucky, Saturday, 1:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Tim Couch might set this record several times over
during the season _ a school record 498 yards passing in the
Wildcats' 68-34 win over Louisville. Also in the record books are
an SEC-tying seven TD passes for him and a school record 801 yards
in total offense, the second-highest ever in the conference. UK's
68 points were the highest since a 72-point outburst against
Tennessee Tech in 1951. On the ground, RB Derek Homer had 123 yards
and a TD.... Eastern Kentucky is led by current American Football
Coaches Association president Ron Kidd, whose 281 wins are tops
among active I-AA coaches. ``If they run up the score on us, I'm
going to put (Kentucky coach Hal Mumme) on the worst committee I
can find,'' Kidd joked. Eastern Kentucky beat Div. II Kentucky
State 43-13 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   LSU vs. Arkansas State, Saturday, 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Tailback Rondell Mealey has seen limited practice this week and
is listed as questionable for Saturday's opener. Mealey is still
recovering from a broken foot. ... Coach Gerry DiNardo said tight
end Jamal Pack (shoulder) is ``fifty-fifty.'' ... Freshman
linebacker Adam McConathy has left the team for undisclosed
reasons. McConathy (6-5, 226), was Louisiana's Mr. Football in
1997. ... This the latest opening game for LSU since it defeated
Texas A&AMP;M 35-17 on Sept. 13, 1986. LSU went on to win the SEC
championship that season. ... Arkansas State, LSU's opponent on
Saturday, was ranked 108th out of 112 Division I teams in preseason
by the Sporting News. ... If LSU wins and stays at No. 7 in the AP
poll, it would represent the Tigers' highest ranking after a game
in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   MISSISSIPPI vs. Auburn, Saturday, 3:30 p.m. Fox SS
</P>
<P>
   Ole Miss has lost five SEC openers in a row and five in a row to
Auburn. ... The Rebels' last win over Auburn was 45-21 in Oxford in
1992. ... Ole Miss is looking to start 2-0 for the third
consecutive season. The last time the school was 2-0 three years in
a row was 1970-72. ... After last week's 30-10 win over Memphis,
Ole Miss is 11-0 in non-conference games under coach Tommy
Tuberville. ... Rookie quarterback Romaro Miller threw for 332
yards in his first start against Memphis last week. But the defense
he saw last week will be nothing like the one he'll face Saturday
against Auburn, Tuberville said. ``We told him preseason was
over,'' he said.''(Auburn defensive coordinator) Brother Oliver
does a good job of confusing quarterbacks. He'll have to play with
a lot of poise.''
</P>
<P>
   MISSISSIPPI STATE at Memphis, Saturday, 12:30 p.m., Fox SS.
</P>
<P>
   After routing Vanderbilt 42-0, the Bulldogs travel to Memphis
for their first road contest. Mississippi State's 424 yards against
the Commodores' highly touted defense raised some eyebrows, but
coach Jackie Sherrill thinks it's because his offensive attack is
balanced the way he wants it. ``We've been trying to get to this,''
he said. ``This is the first time we've been able to accumulate the
kind of players we want at this level.'' ... Sherrill, asked by a
Pennsylvania reporter during a Wednesday conference call to comment
on Penn State coach Joe Paterno's impending 300th career victory,
curtly told him to call his office instead to arrange a separate
interview. ``This is an SEC conference call, and we talk about only
SEC football here,'' said Sheril.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH CAROLINA vs. Georgia, Saturday, 6 p.m. ESPN2
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina's young offensive line practiced against first-
and second-team defenders this week instead of smaller scout team
players. That's because Georgia is ``as good with their down
(linemen) as anybody,'' coach Brad Scott said. ``You're looking at
6-5, 300-pounders who really run well.''... Scott said that running
back Troy Hambrick, suspended for the Ball State game, must earn
his job back. Boo Williams started last week's game. ... Twenty-two
freshmen and other first-year players played in last week's game.
Four more could play before the season is over. ... Despite a 5-6
season in 1997, all six of South Carolina's home games for this
season are sellouts. ... Defensive end John Stamper (knee) is
doubtful, while fullback Antoine Nesmith (knee) will return to his
backup position.
</P>
<P>
   TENNESSEE vs. Florida, Sept. 19
</P>
<P>
   Backup middle linebacker Shawn Johnson suffered a broken leg
against Syracuse and is expected to be out for the season. Johnson,
who backed up All-SEC candidate Al Wilson, might be replaced by
Chris Ramseur. ... Tennessee used eight different linebackers
against Syracuse. ... Running back Jamal Lewis had five carries for
11 yards in the third quarter against Syracuse and 81 yards on
eight carries in the fourth quarter. ... Tennessee is No. 2 behind
Florida State in the Sagarin ratings, one of the components of the
Bowl Championship Series formula. ... Coach Phillip Fulmer said
this week he was glad his team had a week off to get ready for
Florida. ``After a tough game with Syracuse, we needed it because
of the bumped and bruised people we have.''
</P>
<P>
   VANDERBILT at Alabama, Saturday, 12:30 p.m., WXIA
</P>
<P>
   With the Mississippi State debacle fresh in his mind, Commodore
coach Woody Widenhofer said he would name a starting quarterback,
either Greg Zolman or David Wallace, both freshmen, possibly by
today. Hi Lewis, who started the game, threw interceptions his
first two passes and was benched after just six attempts. He's now
listed as third on the depth chart. Zolman was 7-for-12 passing for
64 yards, while Wallace had 19 yards on 3-for-5 passing.... The
defense was on the field for 40 Bulldog snaps in the first half,
and was exhausted the rest of the way in giving up 424 yards. ``We
never got started, and it carried over to the defense in the second
half,'' Widenhofer said. ... LB Jamie Winborn had 15 tackles in his
first college start.

 &HT;    Falcons, Eagles blitz-weary
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It came as no shock to anyone associated with the Philadelphia
Eagles that Seattle blitzed so much Sunday, just as the Atlanta
Falcons were not surprised that Carolina sent everyone but the P.A.
announcer after quarterback Chris Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   In the modern NFL, almost everybody blitzes a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quarterbacks are getting a lot more accurate, and you can't
get all the bumps on receivers (since the rules were changed) so
people are going to be able to .... get open,'' said Philadelphia
coach Ray Rhodes, whose team will play Atlanta Sunday in the
Falcons' home opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the best ways to take that away,'' Rhodes said, ``is to
rush with some sort of zone-blitz or all-out blitz to disrupt the
timing of the play.''
</P>
<P>
   What distressed both teams was how much success their opponents
had. The Eagles gave up nine sacks in a 38-0 loss to the Seahawks,
and although the Falcons beat Carolina 19-14, Chandler was sacked
six times.
</P>
<P>
   So, both teams have gone back to the drawing board. In the
Falcons' case, Chandler is working on getting rid of the ball
faster. Also, offensive line coach Art Shell is working overtime
with rookie right tackle Ephraim Salaam, second-year left guard
Calvin Collins and all his linemen to recognize what's coming, how
to communicate with each other and how to handle it.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia, well, that's another story.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that means we scale back on our offensive game plan _
whatever,'' Rhodes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything has to be shortened up a little bit,'' he said,
referring to routes run by receivers and the number of steps the
quarterback takes on his drop. ``If we have to go seven-man,
eight-man protections, we'll do that. I'm not going to count
anything out.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of times, problems come down to a lack of, or mix-up in,
communication between offensive linemen, or between linemen and
backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams are disguising what they do'' Shell said. ``Normally, if
a linebacker walks up in that gap, the guard takes him right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if they're timing it, running up in there (just before the
snap), that's awfully tough,'' Shell said, because the lineman
already has taken another assignment. ``We're adjusting. We're
going to protect the 'A gap' (between center and guard, where
Carolina had success).''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, if linemen block a man to the outside, a linebacker
or defensive back can slither through the middle before a back can
pick him up. A quarterback can change the blocking scheme _ if he
sees what's coming in time.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, they try to move late, and overload (an area)
late (just before the snap),'' Chandler said. ``Instead of (calling
for running backs to) block the middle linebacker and the
strongside linebacker, they'll kick over and block the middle
linebacker and the weakside linebacker.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's one strategy that's best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting the ball out quick,'' Chandler said, ``is the best
thing for the line and everybody.''

NOT TOO PROUD TO OBSESS, ALL OVER AGAIN  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Ken Tucker is the critic-at-large for Entertainment Weekly  
 By KEN TUCKER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Quick, think back to ``The Big Chill,'' Lawrence Kasdan's 1983
comic drama about baby-boomer friendship and dashed idealism, with
the ghost of a Kevin Costner performance left on the cutting-room
floor.
</P>
<P>
   What is the first scene that comes to mind? Of course it's when
the stars _ Glenn Close, Kevin Kline, Jeff Goldblum, William Hurt,
JoBeth Williams, Mary Kay Place and Tom Berenger _ dance around the
kitchen after a raucous meal of pasta and wine, doing Chuck Berry
duckwalks and modified boogie-downs, washing dishes to the
cranked-up sound of the Temptations' ``Ain't Too Proud to Beg.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene encapsulates the spirit of the film: friendship forged
in the footloose optimism of the '60s; camaraderie instantly
regained through the nostalgic power of good pop music.
</P>
<P>
   Seen these days _ and it can be in a 15th-anniversary theatrical
rerelease, starting Nov. 6 _ ``The Big Chill'' should also be
acknowledged as the progenitor of pop-culture phenomena both
insidious and salutary. On the one hand, the movie probably gave
far too many ad agencies the notion to buy up the rights to '60s
songs, for use in pushing the nostalgia buttons of key demographic
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the film's knack for casual crosstalk and a
sprawlingly relaxed mise en scene _ a sort of openhearted, benign
version of what Robert Altman had been doing more disorientingly,
more radically, a decade earlier _ can now be recognized as a
precursor to quietly adroit, ensemble-cast television shows like
``thirtysomething,'' ``My So-Called Life,'' ``Party of Five'' and
``Dawson's Creek.'' (Who are young Dawson Leery's parents if not
the disenchanted, too-tired-to-boogie, '90s versions of ``The Big
Chill's'' married couple, played by Kline and Ms. Close?)
</P>
<P>
   You may recall the premise that sent the big chill down the big
cast's backs: A beloved mutual friend from their University of
Michigan days has committed suicide, and the chums reunite at his
funeral (the Rolling Stones' ``You Can't Always Get What You Want''
is played haltingly on the church organ) to mourn, reminisce, smoke
dope and debate the sincerity and effectiveness of the political
commitment they abandoned for adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   To say that this crew has gone its separate ways is an
understatement that Kasdan and his co-screenwriter, Barbara
Benedek, played for maximum ironies. After the burial, everyone
assembles at the stately home of Ms. Close and Kline (former
Vietnam War protesters, she is now a doctor while he is the owner
of a chain of athletic-equipment stores ruefully named Running Dog
Shoes).
</P>
<P>
   There's Goldblum, playing a wisecrackingly self-loathing People
magazine reporter who yearns either to strike it rich or to write
something meaningful, preferably both (today, of course, that
character would work for Entertainment Weekly).
</P>
<P>
   There's JoBeth Williams' desperately unhappy homemaker, who
wishes she hadn't settled for suburban security and hungers for a
fling with Berenger, who has become a television actor, the star of
a silly but hugely popular detective show, ``J.T. Lancer.''
</P>
<P>
   (Berenger, in both a droopy mustache and what has always been
``The Big Chill's'' most underrated performance, does a very funny
takeoff on Tom Selleck in ``Magnum P.I.'')
</P>
<P>
   There is Hurt's muzzy-voiced, fuzzy-brained Nick, who went off
to Vietnam and came back wrecked emotionally (sullen, cynical,
withdrawn) and physically (his impotence becomes a major plot
point) and hooked on the illegal drugs he sells to support himself.
The film's most problematic role was handled deftly by Ms. Place,
at that point in her career best known as a charming comic actress
from the television series ``Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, she's a despairing single lawyer who has decided to have a
baby and arrives with the idea of persuading one of her old male
pals to perform a no-risk, no-responsibility impregnation that
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In the DVD, laserdisc and new home-video versions to be issued
early next year, the film will be supplemented with ``The Big
Chill: A Reunion Documentary,'' featuring recent interviews with
the director, co-screenwriter and cast. Here we are reminded, for
example, that the then-unknown Costner was cast as the suicide,
Alex.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Kasdan shot flashback scenes of the group interacting with Alex,
but decided that these moments weren't necessary to a film that was
already running long. All we glimpse of the actor is in the opening
credits: While his face is never seen, the corpse being prepared
for its coffin display has Costner's hairline. (That the future
auteur of seemingly endless movies like ``Dances With Wolves,''
``Waterworld'' and ``The Postman'' should be cut from a film
because it was running too long is an irony only Hollywood could
concoct.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big Chill'' was a solid hit in its initial release,
welcomed with mostly warm notices. The chief reservations about it
were best expressed by the critic Pauline Kael, who in The New
Yorker praised the film's ``well-directed repartee'' but said,
``It's overcontrolled, it's shallow, it's a series of
contrivances,'' which would lead anyone who considered himself ``a
deeply committed radical during his student-demonstration days in
the late '60s'' to find the movie ``despicable.''
</P>
<P>
   In the ``Reunion Documentary,'' Kasdan indirectly answers Ms.
Kael's charges when he allows that he always conceived of the
characters as being ``foolish _ driven by the same shallow ambition
and lusts that I am.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest surprise about ``The Big Chill'' in reissue is that
it has aged so well; it is cracklingly funny and shrewd _ a minor
masterwork of navel-gazing comic angst. If anything, the questions
it raises about moral rot and political ineffectualness are more
timely than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The original press kit for the film refers to it repeatedly as
``a comedy of values,'' and it will probably occur to more than one
1998 viewer that it could have been Bill and Hillary Clinton
boogieing around that kitchen table to the Temptations.
</P>
<P>
   But where has the audience for such pointed entertainment gone?
``Chill'' was a hit, whereas late-'90s movies with the same
philosophical underpinnings _ Warren Beatty's ``Bulworth'' and Mike
Nichols' ``Primary Colors,'' for example _ have been box-office
disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   It may be that moviegoers today have less patience with the
soul-searching bull sessions that give ``The Big Chill'' its
warmth. Gen-X viewers will probably identify with the film's
secondary character _ Alex's much-younger girlfriend, played by Meg
Tilly, who listens to the boomers' self-flagellating wailing and
says, ``I don't like talking about myself as much as you guys do.''
</P>
<P>
   In the context of the film, this came as a pleasant shock: an
old-fashioned, Gary Cooper-like sentiment from the mouth of a babe.
Ms. Tilly's line now sounds like a prophecy of the criticisms
leveled at the Big Chill generation's want-it-all self-absorption.
</P>
<P>
   So this movie re-emerges to suggest that regret, while poignant,
is pointless; that actions still speak louder than words, and that
you really can't always get what you want.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The sun came up, the alarm went off and the long sweet dream
slipped like silk through the fingers of imagination.
</P>
<P>
   By early Wednesday, the TV was filled with images from Tuesday
night. The pitch. The swing. The crowd cheering and fireworks
bursting overhead. In the background an orchestra played ``When You
Wish Upon a Star'' while the dubbed-in voice of an announcer asked
Mark McGwire, holding his 10-year-old son, what he will do next.
</P>
<P>
   `'We're going to Disney World!'' McGwire shouted.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing more melancholy than the morning after.
</P>
<P>
   I was one of the lucky ones. I didn't see him hit No. 62. I
heard it.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks pre-game broadcast cut away to St. Louis as
McGwire came to bat in the fourth. I was driving south on Seventh
Street, on the way to a girls volleyball game.
</P>
<P>
   The play-by-play man at Busch Stadium was caught off guard. It
was the first pitch. The first swing. A long, low, line drive.
</P>
<P>
   Before he could say anything, the crowd announced what happened.
</P>
<P>
   There was no replay.
</P>
<P>
   There was only the noise of the 50,000 spectators. The
broadcasters described McGwire's trot around the bases, the high
fives, the knot of players surrounding him as he crossed home
plate.
</P>
<P>
   It was radio, though, which doesn't force you to see but allows
you to visualize.
</P>
<P>
   I listened to the broadcast until I pulled into the school
parking lot, then turned off the radio and let the ``pictures''
play in my head as I walked to the gym.
</P>
<P>
   It was hours before I saw a replay of the home run.
</P>
<P>
   By then, most of America had seen it dozens of times. They'd
gorged on it. Stuffed themselves with it. That's the way it is with
TV.
</P>
<P>
   We don't chew before we swallow.
</P>
<P>
   There's no time to savor the moment.
</P>
<P>
   A feast for the imagination that took months to prepare is
gobbled down in seconds, force fed to us by the shovelful before
there's any time to digest.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes we've had our fill.
</P>
<P>
   That's how, overnight, a dream-like journey to baseball history
can become a cheesy trip to Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   The problem isn't that commerce wins out over sport. We expect
that, now.
</P>
<P>
   It's just that it wins so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   If only the race to break the record had taken a little longer.
If only McGwire's chase would have lasted a few more weeks, a few
more days, even a few more hours. That would have been enough to
overlap the delivery of those boxes of material from Kenneth
Starr's office to the politicians on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Watching a slugger go after the home run record is a lot more
enjoyable than watching a special prosecutor knock the president
out of the park.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't work out that way.
</P>
<P>
   Before we could set the birthday cake on the table, McGwire blew
out all 62 candles.
</P>
<P>
   I can't blame him for wanting it to be over. The pressure must
have been unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of us, though, it would have been nice to have a
little more salve to spread on the open wound of reality.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the Starr report will leak out drop by drop, rising
tortuously from the basement until it drowns us with ugly details.
</P>
<P>
   Did Clinton and Monica have more extra base hits than Big Mac?
</P>
<P>
   Will Starr produce a record-breaking number of impeachment
charges?
</P>
<P>
   Will the president last another 62 days?
</P>
<P>
   How big will Monica score on a book deal?
</P>
<P>
   Our attention shifts from breaking records on the ball field to
the broken record of politics, while a glorious home run race gets
re-scripted to fit the needs of TV commercials and endorsement
deals.
</P>
<P>
   It's morning in America.
</P>
<P>
   The long and lovely dream is over. No word yet on the
nightmare. &QL;

   I can't blame him for wanting it to be over. The pressure must
have been unbearable.

   As it is, the Starr report will leak out drop by drop, rising
tortuously from the basement until it drowns us with ugly details.

   Did Clinton and Monica have more extra base hits than Big Mac?
</P>
<P>
   Will Starr produce a record-breaking number of impeachment
charges?
</P>

   Will the president last another 62 days?
</P>
<P>
   How big will Monica score on a book deal?
</P>
<P>
   Our attention shifts from breaking records on the ball field to
the broken record of politics, while a glorious home run race gets
re-scripted to fit the needs of TV commercials and endorsement

BENJAMIN TAYLOR NAMED GLOBE CHAIRMAN, CEO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Benjamin B. Taylor, publisher of The Boston Globe, was
named Wednesday chairman and chief executive of Globe Newspaper
Co., effective Oct. 1. He will succeed William O. Taylor, 66, who
previously said he would retire from the posts this year.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment was announced by Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr.,
chairman of The New York Times Co., which owns the Globe, and
William Taylor after it was approved at a meeting Wednesday of the
Globe's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Taylor, William Taylor's cousin, will continue as the
Globe's publisher, a position he has held since April 1, 1997.
William Taylor, who has been chairman since 1982, will remain a
director of the Globe and will hold the title of chairman emeritus.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Taylor, 51, joined the Globe in 1972 and served in a
variety of editing and writing jobs before switching to the
business side of the company in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, he announced that the board had approved the
appointment of Alfred S. Larkin Jr., assistant to the publisher, as
the Globe's vice president of human resources.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment is effective Nov. 1, when Frank Grundstrom
retires after serving in that capacity since 1983. The Globe
credited Grundstrom with helping to increase the newspaper's hiring
and promotion of minorities.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of circulation, the Globe ranks as the nation's 15th
largest weekday newspaper and 10th largest Sunday newspaper.

DeLillo, whose novel ``Underworld'' was inspired by a famous,
missing home-run ball. In 1951, the ball that Bobby Thomson hit out
of the Polo Grounds disappeared forever into the crowd and lodged
in DeLillo's imagination, becoming a holy relic of memory that
appears at significant moments of his acclaimed cold-war novel. The
ball, quietly changing hands over the decades, winds up on the
shelf of the novel's protagonist, who fondles its curves and seams
at to summon the past. (Don Hogan Charles/New York Times Photo)

he cannot bear to look at ``Coming Apart,'' his first feature and a
favorite with serious filmmakers. The film is to be shown again at
the Museum of Modern Art on Monday. (Sara Krulwich/New York Times

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Twenty-four years ago, Watergate special prosecutor
Leon Jaworski gave Congress only raw evidence, not the kind of
analysis that lawmakers expect from the report that Whitewater
independent counsel Kenneth Starr delivered Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The material Jaworski supplied about President Richard M. Nixon
_ the only other time this century that Congress has seriously
considered impeaching a president _ is still under seal at the
National Archives, although much of it has been published in other
forms.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Wednesday that
most of the Starr's evidence about President Clinton would be made
public quickly.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt said at his joint news
conference with Gingrich on Wednesday that it was important for the
Watergate process to be followed.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt did not mention specific procedures. But times have
changed, circumstances are different and lawmakers may decide that
many of the Watergate precedents should not apply to the Clinton
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the nature and handling of the prosecutor's
report, these are some of the precedents to consider:
</P>
<P>
   _ In the 1974 impeachment proceedings, the House Judiciary
Committee heard all testimony in private sessions. Nixon's lawyer,
James St. Clair, was permitted to cross-examine the witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   _ St. Clair was on the government payroll as a White House
employee. Nixon did not have a private lawyer or need a legal
defense fund.
</P>
<P>
   _ Only a few senior members of the Judiciary Committee and the
committee's top lawyers were allowed to see Jaworski's documentary
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee's inquiry took seven months. Finally, on
July 27, 29 and 30, 1974, the committee approved three articles of
impeachment. On the crucial first article, charging Nixon with
obstruction of justice, the vote was 27-11. All 21 Democrats on the
panel and six of the 17 Republicans voted for impeachment. Nixon
resigned Aug. 9.
</P>
<P>
   A big difference between 1974 and 1998 is that Congress now has
a much sharper partisan edge. During the Nixon inquiry, about 10
conservative Southern Democrats and moderate Republicans _
including William Cohen, then a freshman Republican congressman
from Maine and now the secretary of defense _ held the balance of
power on the Judiciary Committee. All eventually voted for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Francis O'Brien, who was a top adviser to Rep. Peter Rodino,
D-N.J., the chairman of the committee in 1974, said Wednesday that
``Rodino felt from Day One that this middle group was central, that
only this group could convince the people of the committee's
fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   There are fewer such independent voices in Congress now. And an
analysis this week by Congressional Quarterly, a nonpartisan
magazine about Congress, concluded that the Judiciary Committee was
``one of the most politically polarized panels in Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   What Jaworski gave the Judiciary Committee in 1974 was a
briefcase stuffed with 800 pages of documents and 13 tape
recordings of Nixon's conversations in the Oval Office. An envelope
accompanying the briefcase contained a 60-page report that the
prosecutor called a ``road map.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``road map'' was essentially an index, according to those
who have read it, telling the committee what evidence appeared in
which documents. It had no analysis whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   The documents and the ``road map'' are now in a file at the
National Archives and cannot be made public because they contain
grand jury material that must remain secret unless released in a
court order, said David Paynter, the archivist in charge of the
records.
</P>
<P>
   The Nixon White House challenged Jaworski's authority to give
evidence to Congress, but the authority was upheld by the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Starr was appointed under the independent counsel law, first
enacted in 1978 and renewed in 1994. It specifically instructs the
prosecutor to ``advise the House of Representatives of any
substantial and credible information'' the prosecutor has ``that
may constitute grounds for an impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Nixon inquiry, the Judiciary Committee staff took
depositions from dozens of witnesses. Many of those witnesses were
then questioned in closed sessions by committee members and by St.
Clair, the president's lawyer. Transcripts of this testimony were
published after Nixon had resigned.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that public hearings were not then considered
necessary was that the important witnesses like John Dean, John
Mitchell, H.R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman had all testified
publicly, on television, before the Senate Watergate committee the
year before.
</P>
<P>
   The difference now, a staff assistant said, is that the public
has never had the chance to view and weigh testimony from witnesses
like Monica Lewinsky and Vernon Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   So, the staff member speculated, the Judiciary Committee might
consider public testimony essential.
</P>
<P>
   St. Clair was allowed to make a two-day presentation to the
committee in late June 1974, and on July 19 he filed a 150-page
defense brief. The committee ultimately held public, televised
sessions for five days in late July at which speeches were given
and votes taken.
</P>
<P>
   That the lawyer for Nixon was on the public payroll was never a
matter of controversy, perhaps because all the charges concerned
Nixon's actions as president.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Clinton, he originally hired a private lawyer,
David Kendall, to defend him against Whitewater charges arising
from events before he was elected.
</P>
<P>
   As for rules governing access to the evidence, in today's
climate, lawmakers are unlikely to agree to the Watergate procedure
under which only senior members were allowed to view all of it.
</P>
<P>
   An office is being set up in a House annex a few blocks from the
Capitol where lawmakers can see the evidence.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr on
Wednesday sent to Congress a report that prosecutors said contains
``substantial and credible information'' that could constitute
grounds for the impeachment of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The material, including reams of grand jury transcripts and
audio tapes, arrived at the Capitol four years after Starr took on
the investigation of Clinton's role in failed land deals in
Arkansas, and eight months after his inquiry was expanded to
include the sex and coverup scandal involving a White House intern,
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The delivery of two duplicate, sealed 18-box sets of information
caught Congress by surprise, arriving in two vans late in the
afternoon on 15 minutes notice. Just hours earlier House leaders
had convened a rare bipartisan meeting to began setting the
procedures for deciding whether to begin the first impeachment
proceedings against a president since the Watergate inquiry that
led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon in August 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the east front of the Capitol before mobs of reporters,
staring lawmakers and gawking tourists, Charles G. Bakaly III,
Starr's spokesman, said: ``The office has fulfilled its duty under
the law. Responsibility for the information that we have
transmitted today and for any further actions now lies with the
Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to say whether the information sent to Congress
covered any offenses in the earlier Whitewater investigation, or
whether this report dealt only with the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bakaly would not elaborate on the contents of the
500-page report, it contained a 140-page section outlining possible
grounds for impeachment. Starr has been expected to show Congress
whether the president's conduct amounted to the crimes of perjury,
obstruction of justice, and suborning perjury and abuse of his
office.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly said the independent counsel's investigation is
continuing. The grand jury hearing the Lewinsky matter is to meet
again on Thursday, and lawyers familiar with. Starr's plans said it
would continue to pursue additional evidence.
</P>
<P>
   With his presidency in grave peril, Clinton began the day trying
to appease leading Democrats who have urged him repeatedly to
apologize in public to try to stem public disappointment and dismay
at his conduct. Described as sad and somber, Clinton offered
emotional apologies on Wednesday morning to senior House Democrats
for his liaison with Monica Lewinsky and for his denials of the
relationship. Afterward, Rep. David Bonior of Michigan, the House
minority whip, said Clinton ``needed to be out in the country as
difficult as it will be.''
</P>
<P>
   By mid-day, Clinton was in Orlando, Fla., on a fund-raising
trip, where he made a public display of contrition that contrasted
sharply with his defiant television address on Aug. 17. Hours after
testifying to a grand jury three weeks ago, Clinton first
acknowledged the relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, which he had
denied for seven months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let my family down and I let this country down, but I am
trying to make it right,'' Clinton said at a fund-raising lunch.
``I am determined never to let anything like that happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   As the president planned a series of public events this week,
his strategists have been moving on two fronts, with political and
legal advisers, preparing for the delivery of Starr's report to
Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers had been attempting this week to forestall the
delivery of Starr's report. After unsuccessfully seeking an advance
copy of the report on Monday, David Kendall, the president's
private lawyer, was planning to go to court to challenge the format
and the contents of Starr's report to Congress. The shipment of the
report to Capitol Hill pre-empted such a legal move.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the White House late on Wednesday afternoon, Kendall
briefly tried to characterize Starr's report to Congress as a
one-sided account. The voluminous materials, he said, ``represent
only the prosecutor's allegations, allegations that we have been
denied a chance to review.'' He added, ``But we do know this: There
is no basis for impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Constitution, Congress has the power to impeach the
president for treason, bribery or ``other high crimes and
misdemeanors.'' The House acts as the prosecutor and must initiate
any impeachment proceedings. The Senate is the jury.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   No president has faced such an inquiry since the Watergate
scandal, when the House Judiciary Committee approved three articles
of impeachment against Nixon. He resigned in 1974 before an
impeachment vote by the full House.
</P>
<P>
   Because the House has no standing rules for handling
impeachment, House leaders had just begun to negotiate procedures
when Starr caught them by surprise by sending his report on their
first day back from recess.
</P>
<P>
   As the vans carrying the boxes arrived at the Capitol,
Republican leaders were gathered across the street in front of the
Library of Congress for a news conference on their agenda. Even as
the white and black vans were pulling up, House Speaker Newt
Gingrich was saying he could not confirm their arrival.
</P>
<P>
   With the Capitol rife with rumor late on Wednesday afternoon,
Gingrich, in an unusual move, took questions on the House floor
regarding the report and the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   Because the House has yet to pass a resolution setting out its
procedures, the boxes of documents were put under armed guard in
the nearby Gerald R. Ford House Office building, named for the
Republican who assumed the presidency when Nixon resigned.
</P>
<P>
   There the boxes were put under control of the Sergeant of Arms
and the Capitol Police. In preparation, the locks on the room where
the documents will be stored have been changed in the past few
days.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, R-Ga., said that no House member will have access to
the report until the House passes the resolution, which was being
drafted through the night and expected to be brought to the House
floor as early as Friday.
</P>
<P>
   As the rapid-fire events hurtled forward, members of Congress
seemed acutely aware of the historic responsibility they faced.
Earlier in the day, Sen. Robert Byrd, the chamber's unofficial
historian, compared Clinton to Nixon in his tactics of attack and
delay: ``Many of the mistakes that President Nixon made are being
made all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   But the West Virginia Democrat pleaded from the Senate floor
that Congress practice restraint. ``If sometime in the future, the
American people should come to believe that this president or any
other president has been driven out of office for what they may
perceive to be political reasons, their wrath will fall on those
who jumped to judgment prematurely.''
</P>
<P>
   After their own morning meeting to consider how to handle the
report, Gingrich and House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt put aside
their usual bitter partisanship, to answer questions in Gingrich's
suite, along with three other senior Republicans and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt called impeachment the most grave task facing Congress
next to declaring war. And Rep. Henry Hyde, the chairman of the
House Judiciary Committee, which oversees the process, called the
decision facing the House an ``exercise in individual conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich bristled when one reporter tried to ask whether
lawmakers could ignore the upcoming midterm elections as they weigh
the president's fate. ``Yes,'' he interrupted. ``Yes, yes, yes,
yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said House leaders leaned toward quick public access to
Starr's report, with other raw materials such as grand jury
testimony reviwed by the Judiciary Committee to find ways to
protect ``innocent people'' incidentally mentioned in testimony.
</P>
<P>
   But the House's job was made harder when Starr did not, as
lawmakers had hoped, send an executive summary of his findings.
``We wanted a summary and didn't get one,'' Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the report to Congress had a 25-page introduction, a
280- page narrative of events, and a 140-page section laying out
possible grounds for impeachment. Attached to the report are six
three-ring binders of 2,000 pages of additional materials.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen boxes more contain audio and video tapes and
transcripts, including the president's testimony to the grand jury
and Ms. Lewinsky's description of her relationship with the
president, secretly tape recorded by Linda Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   In his formal referral letter to Gingrich and Gephardt, Starr
pled with lawmakers to treat as confidential ``information of a
personal nature'' contained in supporting materials with the
report.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, Gingrich, Gephardt and some key lieutenants
huddled in another meeting trying to resolve differences over the
draft resolution that will set procedures for turning Starr's
report over to the Judiciary Commmittee. Rep. Gerald Solomon,
R-N.Y., and chairman of the House Rules Committee, said his panel
will draft a two-part resolution. The first section will deal with
making the report public, and it should come to a House floor vote
on Friday. He said the report would most likely be released Friday
afternoon.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The White House and Republicans and Democrats have been
expecting some aspects of the report _ related to whether the
president lied in his deposition when he said he did not have
sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky _ to contain salacious details
of their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, the Rules Committee will deal with procedural issues.
The two sides are still discussing the powers that Hyde wants,
which include the ability to subpoena witnesses, grant them
immunity and enforce contempt charges against them. Democrats are
leery of what they have called extraordinary powers.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt appealed on Wednesday for the president and his lawyer
to have some time to respond to Starr's report before it was
released, and suggested in the meeting with Gingrich that it could
be 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich was noncommittal, according to congressional aides and
the Republicans were not expected to agree. But Democrats said they
believed Gingrich was striving to be nonpartisan.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the morning meeting in his office, Gingrich,
according to several congressional aides, lectured Democrats about
his own treatment when he was censured and fined $300,000 by the
House on ethic charges. But he said that despite his own searing
experience, he would protect the rights of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde on Wednesday vowed that, ``I will not condone, nor
participate in, a political witch hunt. If the evidence does not
justify a full impeachment investigation, I will not recommend one
to the House. However, if the evidence does justify an inquiry, I
will fulfill my oath of office and recommend a fuller inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr's report to Congress on Wednesday culminated years of
investigations into Clinton that began on Jan. 12, 1994, under
Robert B. Fiske, Jr., and then was continued by Starr, who was
named his successor as independent counsel by a three-judge panel
on Aug. 5, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Starr's inquiry has expanded from an
investigation of the Whitewater real estate deal, to controversies
over the White House dismissal of travel office aides, to the
suicide of Vincent Foster, a deputy White House counsel.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Starr began investigating allegations that Mr.
Clinton had had sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky, a White House
intern, then lied about it in a deposition in the sexual harassment
suit brought by Paula Jones.  &QL;

entertainment/arts articles this week for release Sunday, Sept. 13,

   FILMS
</P>
<P>
   HAPPINESS-FILM (Undated) _ At a time when the news media are
awash in the gory details of presidential sexual hijinks, the
public is supposedly beyond shock when it comes to revelations of
bad behavior. Or is it? The acid test will come with the first
public American screenings of Todd Solondz's pitch-black comedy
``Happiness,'' at the New York Film Festival. ``Happiness,'' which
will be released in theaters on Oct. 16 by Good Machine, is a
gleeful, systematic demolition of the myth of the suburban idyll.
By Stephen Holden. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   JONATHAN-MYERS-FILMS (Undated) _ Once upon a time, the talk was
of the It Girl. These days, Jonathan Rhys Meyers has filmmakers
extolling what one might call the A Boy. The A, of course, stands
for androgynous, which is one quality _ an infectious smile and raw
talent are others _ that has the 21-year-old Irishman leading the
latest Anglo-Irish thespian wave. ``Johnny's fabulous to look at,''
said Ang Lee, who cast Rhys Meyers as a long-haired
villain-with-a-difference in his Civil War film, ``Ride With the
Devil,'' which is expected to be released in the spring,
co-starring Tobey Maguire and Jewel. By Matt Wolf. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   NIVOLA-FILMS (Los Angeles) _ Few actors, however successful, can
say that they have a museum in the family, but Alessandro Nivola,
26, can boast of two: one, devoted to his grandfather, the Italian
sculptor Constantino Nivola, is situated in the artist's hometown
in Sardinia, and a second, a far more modest and decidedly
unofficial archive in New York, is devoted to the actor himself. In
his next movie, ``Best Laid Plans,'' a drama starring Reese
Witherspoon and Josh Brolin that is to be released next spring, he
plays a graduate student turned con artist, and in ``I Want You,''
a forthcoming British film by Michael Winterbottom that is set in
the seaside town of Hastings, Nivola plays a paroled murderer
seeking to rekindle a forbidden love affair _ a role he researched
by spending three days in Brixton prison in South London. By
Justine Elias. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   CIVIL-ACTION-FILM (Boston) _ Nonfiction books and films always
dance cheek to cheek with real life, of course. But ``A Civil
Action,'' a Disney movie that is to open on Dec. 25, based on the
acclaimed 1995 book by Jonathan Harr, has an unusually, uncannily
intimate relationship with reality. Perhaps the most intriguing
aspect of the success of the book and potential success of the
movie is this: In their depiction of a cluster of leukemia deaths
among children in the Boston suburb of Woburn and the large-scale
1986 legal battle that ensued over whether industrial pollution was
to blame, the reality they convey is not a comfortable or a simple
one. By Carey Goldberg. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   SAM-ROCKWELL-FILMS (Undated) _ Sam Rockwell is a master of the
quick change. The 29-year-old actor showed his range in January at
the Sundance Film Festival, where he was featured in not one but
three films. He appeared as the romantic, James Dean-like outcast
who mows lawns in John Duigan's ``Lawn Dogs,'' which opened in May;
he slouched across the screen as a hilariously inept safecracker in
John Hamburg's ``Safe Men,'' which opened in July, and he delivered
a chilling performance as a car-salesman-turned-hit-man in Saul
Rubinek's dark comedy ``Jerry and Tom,'' which will also be shown
this month at the Toronto Film Festival. By Laura Winters. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; DARK-COMEDY-FILMS (Undated) _ This season's writers and
directors seem to agree that disturbing material can be a laughing
matter. Several fall releases _ also including ``Very Bad Things,''
``Clay Pigeons'' and ``Home Fries'' _ are self-proclaimed dark
comedies. By Ted Loos. (Moved).
 &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BIG-CHILL-FILM (Undated) _ Quick, think back to ``The Big
Chill,'' Lawrence Kasdan's 1983 comic drama about baby-boomer
friendship and dashed idealism, with the ghost of a Kevin Costner
performance left on the cutting-room floor. What is the first scene
that comes to mind? Of course it's when the stars _ Glenn Close,
Kevin Kline, Jeff Goldblum, William Hurt, JoBeth Williams, Mary Kay
Place and Tom Berenger _ dance around the kitchen after a raucous
meal of pasta and wine, doing Chuck Berry duckwalks and modified
boogie-downs, washing dishes to the cranked-up sound of the
Temptations' ``Ain't Too Proud to Beg.'' The scene encapsulates the
spirit of the film: friendship forged in the footloose optimism of
the '60s; camaraderie instantly regained through the nostalgic
power of good pop music. Seen these days _ and it can be in a
15th-anniversary theatrical rerelease, starting Nov. 6 _ ``The Big
Chill'' should also be acknowledged as the progenitor of
pop-culture phenomena both insidious and salutary. By Ken Tucker.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   PRINCE-OF-EGYPT-FILM (Undated) _ To appeal to all age groups,
goes the perceived wisdom, an animated feature must include a
musical-comedy format with at least one show-stopping song, funny
and cute sidekicks to the hero or heroine, an even balance of
laughter and tears, a fairy-tale setting and a romantic narrative
thrust. In 1998, Jeffrey Katzenberg is putting finishing touches on
``The Prince of Egypt,'' the first animated feature from
Dreamworks, the studio he founded with Steven Spielberg and David
Geffen. The subject is unusual for animation: nothing less than the
epic biblical story of Moses, adapted from the first half of
Exodus. The film, in fact, defiantly goes in the opposite direction
from the now-ingrained Disney pattern in nearly every way. In ``The
Prince of Egypt,'' there is no romantic fairy-tale narrative
engine, and, with a cue from Spielberg, action-adventure is
emphasized over humor. By John Canemaker.

   CRUISE-GUIDE-FILM (New York) _ ``The Cruise,'' a documentary,
directed by Bennett Miller, opens on Oct. 23 at the Angelika Film
Center in New York. Throughout 1996, Miller followed Timoty (Speed)
Levitch _ who was in his fifth year of leading double-decker loops
of Manhattan, first with Apple Tours, then with the Gray Line _ and
entered into the extraordinary rhythm of the guide's life. By Joe

   WITHERSPOON-FILMS (New York) _ Chatting in a restaurant, Reese
Witherspoon veered from such pensive asides to moments in which she
spoke giddily, even rhapsodically, about life as a fledgling
22-year-old movie star. In one breath, she gushed about how
exciting it was to work with Paul Newman and Susan Sarandon in the
thriller ``Twilight,'' released earlier this year, or to act
opposite her boyfriend, Ryan Phillippe, in the forthcoming ``Cruel
Intentions,'' an updating of ``Les Liaisons Dangereuses.'' In the

   FRANKENHEIMER-FILMS (Los Angeles) _ With enduring films like
``Days of Wine and Roses,'' ``The Manchurian Candidate,'' ``Birdman
of Alcatraz,'' ``Seven Days in May'' and ``The Fixer'' to his
credit, John Frankenheimer was one of the foremost directors of the
1960s. But he stumbled under the weight of personal problems and
bad choices, and, starting in the '70s, his career went awry. For
filmmakers and actors who have made wrong decisions, few places are
as cruel as Hollywood. At the age of 68, with few illusions,
Frankenheimer is seeking to complete &UR;  &LR; a comeback this fall with a
large-scale action-thriller, ``Ronin,'' which opens on Sept. 25. By

   BROADWAY-SEASON (New York) _ There are a few things that can be
looked forward to this season with the sort of hopes that are
usually dangerous. These are centered on three actors who, though
none have been on Broadway recently, arrive with sterling pedigrees
and in roles that would seem to fit them like wet suits. Martin
Short, the comedian of a thousand professional alter egos, will
appropriately be playing not one but a number of roles in the
Roundabout Theater Company's revival of the 1962 musical ``Little
Me'' this fall. Judi Dench, the great English actress who recently
won American hearts as a startlingly human Queen Victoria in the
movie ``Mrs. Brown,'' returns to New York this spring in David
Hare's London hit ``Amy's View.'' And Kevin Spacey, the Academy-
and Tony Award-winning actor who defies the casting director's
notions of ``type,'' is also due this spring as Eugene O'Neill's
dream-smashing salesman in ``The Iceman Cometh,'' a role he played
to feverish acclaim in London. By Ben Brantley. (Moved).

   FOSSE-THEATER (Undated) _ Gwen Verdon and Ann Reinking are two
of the most respected performers to star on the American
musical-comedy stage in modern times. And Bob Fosse, the
choreographer and director, famously loved both women, as
individuals and as artists, showcasing them indelibly onstage and
on screen. Since Fosse's death in 1987 at the age of 60, Ms. Verdon
and Ms. Reinking have gone to the wall to ensure that the spirit of
the man they knew would be kept vividly alive. This season, they
have collaborated as part of a team that is bringing ``Fosse: A
Celebration in Song and Dance'' to Broadway. By Mindy Aloff.

   EIFMAN-BALLET (Undated) _ Boris Eifman's choreography, like his

Petersburg gave audiences a jolt when this 21-year-old Russian
troupe made its New York debut in April with provocative
psychodramas about Tchaikovsky and the ballerina Olga Spessivtseva.
When the Eifman Ballet returns to City Center Jan. 19 through 31,
it will be easier to see why Eifman's highly expressive use of the
ballet idiom is so dramatic and stunning. ``The Karamazovs,'' his

album was released in 1995. In one pop-culture master stroke, the
album introduced a mainstream audience to what punks, post-punks,
riot grrrls and alternative rockers had been shouting for more than
a decade: that women were angry, intelligent, carnal, sick of being
victims and ready to speak for themselves. Ms. Morissette's new

You can construct theories that are high-blown (the shows reflect

CHICAGO POLICE REVIEW HOW TO TREAT JUVENILE OFFENDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: SUBS lead to change offenders to suspects.) 
 (nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ After dropping murder charges against two boys, ages 7
and 8, in the brutal slaying of an 11-year-old girl, police
officials say they are taking a closer look at how they treat
juvenile suspects.
</P>
<P>
   The police charged the boys on Aug. 9 after saying they had
confessed to the murder of Ryan Harris. No lawyer or parent was
present during the questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Police spokesman Pat Camden said the department was talking with
the State's Attorney's office about requiring officers and
prosecutors to videotape interviews with suspects younger than 12
and having a parent or guardian at such questioning.
</P>
<P>
   At a City Council meeting Wednesday, Alderman Robert Shaw
introduced legislation that would require a psychologist to be
present when any suspect under the age of 11 is questioned.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the proposed changes ``a step forward,'' Elizabeth
Tarzia, a public defender representing the younger boy, said this
case can help define how juveniles are treated in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Experts we've talked to say children under the age of 12
simply cannot understand their Miranda rights. They really ought to
have an attorney present,'' Ms. Tarzia said.
</P>
<P>
   Since restarting the investigation, police have questioned and
released a man known as the toy man, who the 7-year-old's family
had said gave numerous toys to the boy in the days preceding the
murder.
</P>
<P>
   However, after the man passed a polygraph test and endured
several hours of questioning, police said they were confident that
he was not involved in the murder, and released him. They did send
a blood sample, which he gave voluntarily, to be tested for DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Police are still awaiting DNA test results from the 11-year-old
girl's underwear, where police found semen last week, prompting the
release of the two boys.
</P>
<P>
   Though charges have been dropped against the two boys, Police
Superintendent Terry Hillard has said the department is reserving
the right to reinstate those charges if the investigation warrants.
As a result, attorneys for the two boys have advised their clients
not to talk to police, effectively eliminating two possible eye
witnesses for the police to question further.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police have said that while the case is currently
dismissed, our client remains a suspect, and as long as that is the
case, we have told him not to talk to police,'' said Ms. Tarzia.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-year-old girl was spending the summer with a godmother in
the Englewood neighborhood of Chicago when she was killed on July
27. The police originally accused the boys of beating her with a
rock and suffocating her by shoving her underwear in her mouth and
leaves up her nose in an effort to steal her bicycle.

CLUES POINT TO FIRE'S LOCATION ON SWISS JET
</HEADLINE>
   (nk)

   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ Investigators said Wednesday evening that
they had their first evidence of the location of a fire that
apparently caused the crash of Swissair 111, which went down a few
minutes after the pilots reported smoke in the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   According to the plane's flight-data recorder, which was
recovered on Monday, two computers on the left side of the plane
near the nose began recording bad data a few minutes after the
distress call, investigators say. The fire may have been affecting
the computers, or more likely, the wires that lead to them,
investigators believe.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, one of the fire-damaged parts of the plane that
floated to the surface has been identified as a shearling seat
cover from the first officer's chair, on the right side of the
cockpit, according to investigators. That finding, too, suggests
that there may have been a fire in the so-called avionics
compartment, a small space filled with racks of electronics gear.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators cautioned, however, that it was far too early to
draw any definitive conclusions. And there was no indication so far
about the cause of the fire.
</P>
<P>
   The two computers began recording ``anomalies'' a short time
before the data recorder, known as the black box, stopped working,
said investigators who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The computers in question are an air data computer, which
gathers information for the autopilot and other equipment, and a
flight control computer that is the heart of the autopilot.
</P>
<P>
   The plane is designed to be flown safely without either of those
computers or their backups, so investigators do not believe that
the bad data made the plane crash. Rather, they are looking at the
location, on a rack on the captain's side of the plane, and on the
wires that feed data to those computers.
</P>
<P>
   The new information emerged on a day when the chief of the
inquiry declined to brief the news media and went instead to a
memorial service for the 229 people who died in the crash last
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The chief investigator, Vic Gerden, of Canada's Transportation
Safety Board, arrived at Halifax International Airport on Wednesday
afternoon to greet the American delegation to the memorial service.
Asked by a reporter about progress on decoding the one black box
thus far recovered, he would say only, ``We're working on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerden met Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater, FAA
Administrator Jane Garvey, and National Transportation Safety Board
Chairman James Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Divers know the location of the second black box, the cockpit
voice recorder, but have not yet brought it to the surface.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, the Canadian Navy moored a diving tender over
the major debris field, using four concrete blocks located outside
the search area. The arrangement will allow them to move their
ship, the Granby, precisely around the search area. They also set
up the Granby to pipe air down to divers, an arrangement that will
permit the divers to stay on the bottom for 45 to 50 minutes,
instead of five to 10.
</P>
<P>
   The search area is under 190 feet of water. The new diving
system pipes a mixture of oxygen and helium to the divers, which
reduces the risk of decompression sickness.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to divers, the Canadian effort is also using remote
control operated robot surveillance vehicles, and American
technicians have begun setting up another remote control operated
vehicle, aboard the Navy salvage ship Grapple, which slipped into
port here Wednesday and is expected to be at work on the debris by
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Oceaneering Inc., of Upper Marlboro, Md., sent two five-person
crews, who can operate their vehicle 24 hours a day, unlike human
divers, who can operate only in daylight.
</P>
<P>
   That drone could retrieve the cockpit voice recorder, if the
weather gets too rough. ``It has retrieved flight recorders on
other plane wrecks, deeper than divers could go,'' said Chris
Klentzman, manager of government operations at the firm.
</P>
<P>
   A major target for the searchers is the cockpit. Brought to the
surface, it could tell them where the fire began, and some of its
instruments store data in computer chips that could still be
retrieved.
</P>
<P>
   Some investigators thought Wednesday that they had found the
cockpit, 4.5 miles from the rest of the debris, but Jim Harris, a
spokesman for the Transportation Safety Board, said that
investigators now doubted that the object in question was actually
part of the plane. Mapping of the bottom, along with searches of
the shorelines, is continuing. &QL;

RUSSIANS FLOCKING TO THE BIG SCREEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SOPHIA KISHKOVSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Five years ago, Raymond Markovich and Paul Heth carried
reels of second-run American films on their laps and candy bars and
popcorn bags in their luggage on flights from Los Angeles to
Moscow, using their credit cards to finance a hotel movie theater
here frequented by expatriates.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the two operate Kodak Kinomir (Kodak Cinema World), one
of the world's top-grossing single-screen cinemas, just blocks from
the Kremlin. They plan to open up to 15 multiplexes, with 100
screens in all, over the next five years, in an investment
projected at $110 million. They are part-owners of a film
distribution company with exclusive rights to Walt Disney and
Columbia Tri-Star pictures in Russia, so they should have no
problems filling their screens. And they say the financial crisis
now shaking Russia has affected neither their plans nor attendance
at Kinomir, which continues to play to packed houses.
</P>
<P>
   From the Revolution in 1917 through perestroika a decade ago,
Russians flocked to movie theaters. The brutal Stalin era produced
happy movie musicals. Patriotic war movies helped spur the Soviet
Union to victory over Hitler. Films made during perestroika helped
bring down communism.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance dropped in the mid-1990s. But despite such continuing
economic turmoil as the free fall of the ruble in recent weeks,
those who know the movie industry say that Russians, not just
Muscovites, are ready to go back to the big screen. Doctors, miners
and schoolteachers go unpaid for months, but economic hardship may
actually be encouraging people to go to the movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russians like to be together,'' said Sergei Livnev, director
of the Gorky Film Studios. ``They're very communal. They want to
watch a movie, then discuss it.''
</P>
<P>
   Just two years ago, the Russian film industry was pronounced
dead by the head of its own cinematographers' union. Hollywood
studios were boycotting the market because of rampant video piracy.
And theaters, with an overall occupancy rate of 5 percent, had to
rent out space for auto showrooms and nightclubs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the success of Kinomir, which Heth said had $3 million in
ticket sales and $1.6 million in concession sales in 1997, has
inspired Russian and foreign investors to look beyond the economic
instability and seek a cut of the action.
</P>
<P>
   Gorky Film Studios is promoting a $94 million project to develop
100 modern movie theaters across Russia, although Livnev
acknowledges that plans may well change if the crisis continues.
Down the street from Kinomir, Sergei Lisovsky has refitted a vast
2,500-seat theater and is planning to put up 100 screens for about
$120 million. Lisovsky, whose advertising and concert promotion
empire, Premier SV, has distribution rights to Warner Brothers and
Miramax films, is building a multiplex and shopping mall near one
of Moscow's busy train stations. The only change since the currency
crisis, he says, is that his French partners in the project have
raised interest rates on their loans.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow's mayor, Yuri Luzhkov, who last year touted shopping
malls and hypermarkets, is promoting multiplexes to liven up the
city and is courting potential investors such as Warner Brothers.
``We're in discussion with a number of groups,'' said Millard Ochs,
president of Warner Brothers International Theaters in Los Angeles.
``Kinomir has demonstrated what can happen with a single-screen
cinema.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinomir's home is the former Soviet-built ``house of culture''
of the newspaper Izvestia, once a gathering place for concerts,
Communist films and propaganda sessions. More recently, neon signs
and memorabilia for blockbusters such as ``Men in Black'' have
replaced Soviet slogans, and a concession counter serves up
Coca-Cola, popcorn and, in a nod to Russian habits, beer.
</P>

<P>
   Financial crises may have deflated such indicators of
middle-class well-being as appliance sales, but Russians stood in
line for hours last winter to pay up to $25 at the box office and
up to $200 to scalpers for tickets to ``Titanic.'' Last weekend,
even with ticket prices increased 10 to 30 percent, viewers lined
up for ``Armageddon.'' One thing moviegoers have not snapped up is
the movie tie-in product, not because such items are expensive, but
because they are cheap. ``This is not a T-shirt and baseball cap
market,'' Markovich said. ``It's more Gucci and Versace.'' A coffee
bar run by Nescafe and Russia's first TGI Friday's restaurant help
make Kinomir a hot spot for trendy Muscovites.
</P>
<P>
   Heth, 34, came to Moscow in 1993 to deal in timber products. He
stumbled into the movie business after his seatmate on a
Moscow-bound flight happened to say he was involved in the opening
of a movie theater at the Radisson Slavyanskaya Hotel. When the man
said he had no advertising for the premiere, Heth said he and his
business partner, Markovich, could handle it. In fact, the
Heth-Markovich partnership then consisted of dreaming up business
propositions while patronizing a favorite expatriate watering hole
in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Markovich, 32, was working as a lawyer. One of his clients was
Paul Tatum, an American businessman who was embroiled in a lawsuit
over the business center he ran at the Radisson. Tatum was shot to
death near the hotel in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, Markovich and Heth began to shop around a business
plan for a showcase movie theater. Eastman Kodak, which opened a
Russian subsidiary in 1993, agreed to back Kinomir.
</P>
<P>
   Markovich and Heth's first free-standing multiplex will be on a
street that already features a Planet Hollywood restaurant and the
Beverly Hills Casino, which is owned by Chuck Norris, the
television action-film star.
</P>
<P>
   The interest in multiplexes rose as the resurgent Russian movie
industry released 66 new films in 1997, up from a dismal 20 in
1996. Eastman Kodak's subsidiary, Kodak AO, reports an 80 percent
increase over last year in sales of the film on which movies are
printed. (When the Soviet Union was still intact, production
thrived in several republics, including Georgia and Ukraine, and
400 films were released in 1991.)
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Gusinsky, head of the holding company Media-Most, with
a newspaper, magazine and television network already under his
belt, has expanded into film production. His new company, KinoMost,
plans to develop movie theaters across Russia and build a modern
film studio.
</P>
<P>
   The man who heads KinoMost, Vladimir Dostal, the film director,
says the number of moviegoers will keep growing if Russians have
comforting movies and nice, new theaters to see them in.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't go to movie theaters to watch the news, to watch
people being killed,'' he said. ``We will build happy endings. Do
you often see an American film where the hero hangs himself and the
heroine drowns?''

PHILIPPOUSSIS IS READY TO MOVE UP THE RANKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (also see TEN-US-OPEN)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ His fellow Australian John Newcombe was the first to
call him Scud, and for much of his brief career, Mark Philippoussis
has been true to that sobriquet. He has created plenty of sparks.
He has received plenty of attention. And, despite some direct hits
on important targets, he has performed below expectations.
</P>
<P>
   It is early yet to be sure of substantial change. Young tennis
players who make millions of dollars before they have made it far
in a major tournament are easy prey to reversals of fortune. But as
of this summer, Philippoussis has more than a musical name, or a
Ferrari, or a serve that can leave his opponents shaking their
heads and viewing the future of tennis with trepidation.
</P>
<P>
   He has results. After striking bottom at Queen's Club in London
in June and publicly mulling the idea of an impromptu sabbatical
from the sport, he reached his first Grand Slam quarterfinal at
Wimbledon in July, losing to the eventual champion, Pete Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the 21-year-old Philippoussis is in the quarterfinals of
the U.S. Open, and the opponent blocking his path to a new level is
no Sampras. It is the little-known Thomas Johansson of Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a big opportunity, even though he's beaten some great
players,'' Philippoussis said.
</P>
<P>
   It is a big opportunity for Philippoussis and for his nation.
With Patrick Rafter safely in the semifinals, Philippoussis is
poised to become the second Australian among the last four, and the
first all-Aussie final at the U.S. Open since 1970 is hardly out of
the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not counting my chickens yet, but I think there's a
possibility, even a good possibility,'' Pat Cash said.
</P>
<P>
   Cash, the 1987 Wimbledon champion, is close enough to
Philippoussis to know. They both come from Melbourne and first
practiced together when Philippoussis was a teen-ager. In April,
when Philippoussis was in the middle of a public dispute with
Newcombe, Tony Roche and the rest of the Australian Davis Cup team
over his decision not to play against Zimbabwe in the first round,
Cash sent him a supportive fax from his home in London.
</P>
<P>
   And after Philippoussis lost in the first round at Queen's on
grass to the clay-court specialist Jordi Burillo, Philippoussis'
coach, Gavin Hopper, asked Cash to lend a friendly ear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark was having a few ups and downs really,'' said Cash, who
offered him grass-court tips, moral support and a blueprint to
professionalism, courtesy of his own career. ``I was happy to help.
If you had a choice to pick one player in the world to coach, apart
from Sampras, who you don't have to coach at all other than getting
his racquets strung, I'd pick Philippoussis.''
</P>
<P>
   The son of a Greek father and Italian mother who immigrated to
Australia in 1973, Philippoussis first captured the tennis
community's undivided attention with a straight-set victory over
Sampras. It came in the third round of the Australian Open in his
native city in 1996, and it was a remarkable display of controlled
aggression and power in which Sampras never managed to break the
strapping 6-foot-4-inch teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   But in the next round, Philippoussis was outplayed and
out-thought by his wily countryman Mark Woodforde. He overhit
consistently in that match, and that has remained a weakness, along
with his off-court priorities, which have sometimes leaned toward
speedy cars and lively night life.
</P>
<P>
   But Philippoussis has lost weight by training hard with Hopper,
who also coaches Monica Seles, and by improving his eating habits:
now favoring large tubs of nonfat yogurt instead of large slices of
late-night pizza. His improved conditioning has allowed him to use
his power more selectively this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've committed myself in these Grand Slams, which
you've got to do,'' Philippoussis said after beating Tim Henman on
Tuesday. ``Inside of me, I really believe that I can win this
tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   When Rafter made his leap in the ranking a year ago that
culminated in his victory at Flushing Meadows, he said he benefited
from the fact that Philippoussis was monopolizing much of the
attention. This year, Rafter has been in the spotlight, and
Philippoussis in the shadows.
</P>
<P>
   The two were once doubles partners and close friends, but a
Davis Cup rift in April pulled them apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting back to being friends again,'' Rafter said,
``and I think he might show his full potential here this week. He's
getting older. He's maturing and dealing with things a lot better.
He's ready.'' &QL;

POLICE RELEASE TAPE SHOWING ATTACK AT RALLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In an effort to show that police actions at
Saturday's youth rally in Harlem were justified, Commissioner
Howard Safir on Wednesday released portions of a police videotape
of the rally in which officers mounted the stage only after they
were attacked by demonstrators hurling chairs and other debris.
</P>
<P>
   The videotape, which officials said had not been edited,
supported Safir's contention that officers in riot gear first moved
toward a generator behind the stage to cut power to the sound
system, and that they stormed the stage only after being pelted
with bricks, bottles and other objects.
</P>
<P>
   But Safir and his aides maintained their silence Wednesday on
the decision to send a low-flying helicopter over the crowd shortly
before the rally ended. In an interview Wednesday night, First
Deputy Commissioner Patrick Kelleher said that he would not discuss
the ``tactical decisions'' made by Chief of Patrol John Scanlon,
the ranking commander at the scene, whom he praised for his
handling of a difficult assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher also declined to discuss Scanlon's decision to send a
phalanx of officers in riot helmets toward the generator for the
stage even though, as Kelleher acknowledged, the last speaker,
Khallid Abdul Muhammad, had already ended his remarks.
</P>
<P>
   The police decided to release the tape Wednesday to counter
widespread reports by eyewitnesses and news organizations,
including The New York Times, that the police in riot gear had
stormed the stage before any debris was thrown.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the department had refrained from making the tape
available immediately after the rally, Kelleher said that ``our
legal people'' warned on Saturday that it could be considered
evidence for a forthcoming criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday morning, after District Attorney Robert Morgenthau
had begun a grand jury investigation, Kelleher said he and other
police officials decided that it was important to correct what he
called a public misperception. ``After we talked to our legal
advisers, we thought it was the right thing to do,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, meanwhile, spurned an invitation
Wednesday from the Manhattan Borough President, Virginia Fields, to
meet with her and other black elected officials to explain the
Police Department's handling of the rally.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor instead offered to let Ms. Fields view the police
videotapes of the rally. ``I think the most important thing is not
make-believe meetings,'' he told reporters at the end of a news
conference at an elementary school in Harlem marking the first day
of school. ``The most important thing is getting the truth out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fields is among several black elected officials who have
questioned the department's conduct at the event, known as the
Million Youth March. On Tuesday, she sent a letter to Giuliani
after Morgenthau turned down her request to include an examination
of police tactics in his grand jury investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, she asked for the meeting both to clear up
conflicting versions of what happened on Saturday and to move
beyond the rally and ``begin the healing between fractured
communities.''
</P>
<P>
   In reply, she got a brief letter from Deputy Mayor Joseph Lhota
offering to have police officials brief her on Saturday's events.
</P>
<P>
   ``After this briefing,'' Lhota wrote, ``I would expect that you
would publicly change your position, withdraw your request for an
investigation and commend the police for their responsible, brave
and courageous action on Saturday in keeping the overall peace in
Harlem, at some risk to themselves, as they do throughout our city
every single day.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's snub widened a public divide between the mayor and
black leaders that began growing even before the rally, when he
criticized some Harlem leaders for a failure to criticize Muhammad,
the event's chief organizer, forcefully enough for his anti-Semitic
and anti-white remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fields called the mayor's refusal to meet ``unfortunate and
regrettable'' and said he seemed to be missing her point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we would all agree that the first step in trying to
resolve differences is to communicate so that we are not constantly
talking to each other through sound bites and through things we
read in the paper,'' she said. ``I think he is missing an
opportunity to heal people, respond to issues and get a perspective
that he's not getting.''

BARRAGE OF SIMILAR TV ADS BLURS CANDIDATES, OFFICES AND MESSAGES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With a confusing blur of kindred images, matching
promises and similar campaign slogans, Democrats running in next
week's New York primaries have seized the state's airwaves,
deluging viewers with back-to-back-to-back-to-back appeals that
sometimes seem as indistinguishable as the candidates themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In the space of one commercial break the other night, four
30-second campaign advertisements marched across the screen, a show
of advertising might that the candidates and their aides say will
seem positively slight by next Tuesday's vote.
</P>
<P>
   This is the week that the candidates, and their media
consultants, have waited for all summer: when voters presumably are
finally paying some attention to the race at hand, and when a vast
majority of their advertisements will be put on broadcast and cable
stations across the state. For viewers and voters, though, it is
turning into something else entirely _ a bewildering cacophony of
competing if similar advertisements, the kind of show that one
might expect only at a conference of political scientists.
</P>
<P>
   There will be, it now seems safe to say, no cut-and-slash
advertisements this season, a departure from the standard diet of
American politics. But this often bland display of television
imagery seems perfectly suited for two primaries where there are
few differences, and even fewer clashes, among the candidates for
governor and U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   There on one channel the other evening was Peter Vallone _ or
was that Charles Schumer? _ striding across the screen in front of
a clump of blue-uniformed police officers. There on another was
Geraldine Ferraro _ or was that Mark Green? _ eagerly addressing
the camera with schoolchildren in the background.
</P>
<P>
   Betsy McCaughey Ross, who is competing with Vallone for the
gubernatorial nomination, smiles as she promises to fight abuses by
HMOs. So does Vallone, posing in one of this year's favored
advertising sets: a medical clinic. Schumer, a congressman from
Brooklyn who is running for the Democratic nomination for Senate,
promises to lead the fight for smaller class sizes, a crusade that,
if the all the other political advertisements are to be believed,
will include every major Democrat running for office on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Even the slogans sound similar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Courage that money can't buy,'' intones the announcer in one
of Green's announcements.
</P>
<P>
   ``The courage to lead _ Ferraro,'' intones another baritone
voice in a new advertisement Ms. Ferraro put on the air Wednesday
night. It features her speaking intensely into the camera as she
explains how her upbringing influenced her views on education.
</P>
<P>
   Television advertisements have emerged as among the most
decisive forces in determining the success of political campaigns.
But the clutter of advertising confronting New Yorkers this week _
reflecting, in part, the fact that most candidates are short on
money and had to delay starting their advertising until the last
few days of the campaign _ is leading many Democrats to wonder just
how effective they can be this year. Advertisements are being run
by candidates for Senate, governor, attorney general and Congress.
To complicate matters even more, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato and Gov.
George Pataki have also been advertising for the better part of
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Hank Sheinkopf, who is producing advertisements for Eliot
Spitzer, a Democratic candidate for attorney general, said,
referring to voters: ``The question is, what do they take in? It's
hard to break through in all this clutter.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   All the candidates and their media advisers are trying their
best to do precisely that. Given the prominence of the New York
race for Senate, this contest has drawn some of the more
accomplished consultants in the nation, who are giving their
advertisements small twists that they hope will help them emerge
from the pack.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ferraro's advertisements, produced by Robert Shrum, are
bright and lively, with fast-paced camera action that signals a
vitality that some Democrats have complained has been absent to
date from her campaign. In her latest two ads, she speaks directly
to the camera, displaying an ease with television that her advisers
have always viewed as one of her biggest advantages.
</P>
<P>
   Green, who is the New York City Public Advocate and who has the
least to spend of the three major Democrats seeking the nomination,
is running three commercials that feature an endorsement by
Christopher Reeve, the actor who was disabled in a riding accident.
It is, even Green's rivals say, an arresting ad, showing Reeve with
a breathing tube coming out of his throat and speaking with great
difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   One of Schumer's ads _ which have been heavy recitations of
legislation he pushed through in Congress _ features an actor
playing D'Amato supervising the filling of a pothole. On camera in
the foreground, Schumer challenges D'Amato's reputation as New
York's ``pothole Senator.''
</P>
<P>
   This congestion of commercials plays to the advantage of
candidates who have raised enough money to get on the air before
the glut began. Schumer's advertisements started last January,
while Ms. Ferraro's and Green's have gone on the air only over the
last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Some consultants have questioned the decision by Schumer's
campaign consultant, Hank Morris, to feature the candidate so
prominently in the ads. Even Schumer has described himself as
untelegenic, a characterization that has not been disputed. That
questioning has quieted somewhat in the face of some polls
suggesting that Schumer's standing is improving; and in any event,
even Schumer's rivals concede that the sheer size of his spending
clearly gives him a huge advantage in these final days.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an ideal situation, it's best to match your opponent dollar
for dollar on television,'' said Steve McMahon, who is Green's
consultant. ``We would have loved to have gone when Chuck went, but
our campaign strategy was a different strategy and our campaign
bank account was not quite as full as Chuck's.''
</P>
<P>
   There are not many issues to go around this year, and the
candidates are all reading the same polls, which is why they tend
to be discussing similar issues: HMO restrictions, overcrowded
schools and the future of Social Security.

NEW YORK SCHOOLS BREEZE THROUGH OPENING DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was a day for fifth-graders to learn how not to be
fourth-graders, for a beginning elementary teacher to chase away
butterflies in the stomach and face 31 9-year-olds, for the mayor
and schools chancellor to go back to school and read to
second-graders, and for a group of high school students to marvel
at their brand-new building.
</P>
<P>
   It was the day, with a perfect autumn crispness in the air, that
1.1 million schoolchildren surrendered to the good graces of their
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The first day of school, filled with the promise and anxiety
only a fresh slate can bring, unfurled relatively smoothly Tuesday
in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   There were few reports of long, chaotic lines that had become
the norm in previous years, thanks to an early registration that
signed up the bulk of the system's 5,000 new students.
</P>
<P>
   Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, perched
on tiny elementary-school chairs at the Family Academy in Harlem,
took turns reading stanzas from Ernest Lawrence Thayer's ``Casey at
the Bat,'' which the mayor called the ``greatest baseball poem
ever'' _ a nod to Mark McGwire's hitting 62 home runs and breaking
the single-season record.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Crew sized up opening day: ``I think the work that goes
into planning and staffing and preparing the school buildings can
always be done better. But I'm happy with this level of planning
that goes on. I don't think there's any reason for anybody to feel
anything but the greatest of pride in what we accomplished this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   The day, however, was not trouble-free. In the system's most
overcrowded district, Community School District 24 in Queens,
schools stretched their resources to accommodate an overflow of
students. At Public School 91 in Glendale, an estimated 950
students crammed into a campus intended to hold 650. ``This is far
from ideal in terms of space and room for growing children,'' said
the principal, Kenneth Lombardi.
</P>
<P>
   Although most of the buildings in the city appeared in good
shape, some undergoing renovations or emergency repair were filled
with the noise of hammers, to the dismay of teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to grade today, as if I were a teacher in a
classroom, I would give it an A for instruction and a C for
construction,'' said Randi Weingarten, the president of the
teachers union, the United Federation of Teachers, who was upset to
find jackhammering during school hours at Public School 40 in
Manhattan. ``A smooth opening does not mean we have solved all of
our problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's 361 Catholic elementary and high schools also opened
Wednesday, with the 150,000 students going through orientation
sessions and the first of three half-day sessions before regular
schedules begin next week.
</P>
<P>
   At some public schools, the relative calm allowed for time to
consider coming issues for the school year.
</P>
<P>
   At George Washington High School in Washington Heights, the
principal, Euclid Mehia, was unsure whether his role would change
if, as anticipated, the Police Department takes over security at
the city's 1,100 schools. The school, which has two metal
detectors, is one of 130 citywide that is patrolled at least part
time by a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has an excellent rapport with the kids,'' Mehia said of the
officer, whose beat has included the school for at least five
years. ``But if it's a violation of school code _ a student out of
class, two students fighting _ we handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   In many other classrooms, the work was more mundane if no less
important. With fewer last-minute registration hassles, teachers
wasted little time in setting the tone for the year, which in many
cases means more reading, reading, reading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day in my life I have to read?'' a pupil asked Jett
Ritorto, a fifth-grade teacher at Public School 321 in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day,'' she replied, as a few faces sagged.

LABOR BOARD ORDERS HEARING ON DOCTOR UNION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Fla.)  (lb) 
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Finding that the nature of medical practice has changed
significantly in the era of managed care, the National Labor
Relations Board has resuscitated faltering efforts to organize
doctors by ordering for the first time a full hearing on a union's
petition to represent physicians in private practice.
</P>
<P>
   In an Aug. 27 decision that was released this week, the board
ruled that the labor agency must hold several days of hearings to
allow doctors in southern New Jersey to present details of their
contention that their prerogatives are limited by managed-care
companies, and to allow the companies to argue that the doctors are
independent contractors.
</P>
<P>
   That decision overturned a January ruling by the director of the
agency's Philadelphia regional office, who had rejected a petition
by Local 56 of the United Food and Commercial Workers to represent
some 450 doctors doing work with Amerihealth, a health-maintenance
organization.
</P>
<P>
   In her original decision, the director, Dorothy Moore-Duncan,
found _ as board officials had before _ that doctors who worked
with an HMO remained ``skilled professionals with the
characteristics of independent business people.'' Allowing them to
organize as a union would violate antitrust laws, she ruled.
</P>
<P>
   But in a 2-1 ruling, the board disagreed. Easing the labor
relations agency's historic view of doctors, the majority opinion
said that the determination of who was an independent contractor
and who was an employee was ``not always clear-cut,'' and that a
``fuller picture'' of the relationships between doctors and
health-maintenance organizations was needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The involvement of the HMOs in the physicians' delivery of
health care services and access to patients is a feature of the
changing nature of the health care industry which is presented to
the board for the first time in this case,'' the majority opinion
read. ``It calls into question the historical understanding of the
status of physicians who maintain their own practices.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was cheered by labor groups from Florida to New
Jersey who have been trying to increase the clout of doctors in
their dealings with managed-care companies. Some predicted that the
ruling would have national significance. Others wondered aloud
whether this case was the best one to establish the extent to which
doctors' practices are dictated by their arrangements with
managed-care companies.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling took the industry by surprise, however. Paul Langevin
Jr., president of the New Jersey HMO Association, which represents
the state's 11 managed-care carriers, said that Ms. Moore-Duncan's
ruling in January seemed so clear-cut that he was confident it
would be upheld after the full hearing. He maintained that the
ascendance of managed-care companies had changed the health-care
industry in many positive ways and that it had not transformed
doctors into employees.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Health-maintenance organizations have contended that assembling
pools of doctors has done much to lower and standardize medical
fees and eliminate waste and fraud. But many doctors have said the
companies have assumed too much control over how they practice
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Cinaglia, the president of Local 56, which initiated the
organizing effort that led to the labor board's ruling, called it
``precedent-setting.'' He said the ruling would go a long way
toward helping him eventually integrate the doctors into his
13,000-member union of meat cutters, supermarket workers, truck
drivers and assembly-line workers.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was also applauded by Jack Seddon, an organizer,
based in Tallahassee, Fla., with the American Federation of State,
County and Municipal Employees. He oversees the union's
arrangements with some 8,000 doctors nationwide, and said his
organization would offer Local 56 any assistance it could.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Livingston, general counsel for District 15 of the
International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers,
which is trying to represent a group of northern New Jersey doctors
in their efforts to restructure the basic relationship between
physicians and HMOs, also cheered the ruling, calling it a ``major
victory'' for a whole range of unionizing efforts in medicine.

<TEXT>
<P>
   More than 50 years after they were written in a secret refuge
from the Nazis, long-suppressed pages from the diary of Anne Frank
have given her story a new twist and set off a furor over
exploitation of one of history's top best sellers, only recently
republished in a supposedly ``definitive'' edition.
</P>
<P>
   In the newfound entries _ actually five pages of diary revisions
censored by Anne's father, Otto Frank _ Anne picks apart her
parents' strained marriage, analyzes her own difficult relations
with her mother, Edith, and vows to keep the diary out of her
family's hands as ``none of their business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For a woman in love it cannot be easy to know that she will
never occupy the first place in her husband's heart, and mother
knew,'' Anne says. ``Father appreciates mother and loves her, but
not with the kind of love that I envisage for a marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   As for her diary _ which became one of the world's best-known
books, published in 56 languages _ Anne says, ``I shall also take
care that nobody can lay hands on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The pages augmenting the diary were given last year to Melissa
Muller, an Austrian journalist researching the first biography of
the Jewish girl in Amsterdam, Netherlands, who put an indelible
human face on the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   But in another peculiar twist, Ms. Muller, 31, is now seeing her
new book, ``Anne Frank: the Biography'' (Metropolitan Books), come
out with paraphrases and selected quotes from the unpublished
material while plans are being advanced for updated editions of the
diary to contain the new material in full.
</P>
<P>
   A television biography, ``Anne Frank: The Missing Pages,'' based
on Ms. Muller's book, is scheduled for broadcast on Tuesday with
shots of the pages.
</P>
<P>
   In a measure of how intense the maneuvering has become, an
Amsterdam newspaper, Het Parool, published the disputed segments
last month and also posted them on its web page on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me this is terrible,'' Ms. Muller said in a series of
telephone interviews from Europe amid a crossfire of
recriminations.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are diary revisions written by Anne as she and her
family hid from the Germans in a secret annex over Otto Frank's
busy preserves warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   The missing entries, which were hinted at in a scholarly version
of Anne's diary published in 1986, were supplied to Ms. Muller by
Cornelis Suijk, international director of the Anne Frank Center USA
at 584 Broadway in Manhattan and an intimate of Otto Frank.
</P>
<P>
   Suijk (pronounced Sowk), a 74-year-old economist and Dutch
government auditor with 33 years of affiliations with Anne Frank
organizations in Amsterdam and the United States, said Frank had
given him the pages shortly before his death at 91 in 1980, during
a German police inquiry aimed at authenticating the diary in the
face of neo-Nazi claims it was a forgery.
</P>
<P>
   By Suijk's account, Frank wanted to be able to say honestly that
he no longer had any diary material in his possession, without
revealing anything potentially embarrassing to him or his second
wife, Fritzi, whom he had married in 1953. He also wanted to avoid
any debate over whether he had done the right thing in publishing
Anne's diary in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that something was missing but we had no idea who had
it,'' said Bernd Elias, Anne's cousin and last living relative and
chairman of the Anne Frank Fonds, or foundation, in Basel,
Switzerland, which holds the copyright on the diary and receives
the revenue from publication.
</P>
<P>
   The pages themselves are being claimed by the Netherlands State
Institute for War Documentation, to which Otto Frank bequeathed
custody of the diary. It has asked Suijk to turn them over but he
is claiming a onetime publication right of his own under Swiss law.
He has also sought a sponsor to buy the pages to raise money for
his Anne Frank Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Elias said it was ``absolutely illegal'' for
Suijk to have given the pages to Ms. Muller.
</P>
<P>
   Suijk, in turn, faulted the foundation for amassing what he said
was at least $20 million in royalties from the diary without
properly sharing them with Anne Frank causes around the world,
including his own center, which runs education programs on the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Muller said the Swiss foundation was initially enthusiastic
over her findings and only withdrew support after she declined to
submit her manuscript for review. Her biography includes new
information that for the first time points a strong finger of
suspicion at a cleaning woman, Lena van Bladeren Hartog, now dead,
who may have tipped off the Germans to the Jewish families in
hiding. Ms. Muller said that in going over reports of a Dutch
police inquiry of 1948, she found that the woman had admitted
discovering that Jews were hiding but offered inconsistent accounts
of what she did with that knowledge. The woman was angry over the
death of her son, a volunteer in the German Navy.
</P>
<P>
   The powerful Anne Frank legend has been buffeted by disputes
before. In 1952, the Broadway version pitted Otto Frank against the
novelist Meyer Levin, who had written a stage adaptation that Frank
felt was too focused on Jews as victims and should be
universalized.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Muller, who divides her time between Vienna, Austria, and
Munich, Germany, came to her biography as a freelance journalist
who wrote extensively on childhood. As she recounted, she had no
hint of Suijk's secret when she sought him out, particularly for
information on Anne's mother, Edith Hollander, of whom little had
been written _ even by Anne.
</P>
<P>
   It was, she told Suijk, as if ``Anne Frank had no mother.''
</P>
<P>
   That insight and her other research into the family tree so
impressed him, he said, that he decided to work closely with her.
Still, he said, he met with her for 11 months before deciding to
reveal the pages of missing diary material _ three sides of two
blue sheets and both sides of a salmon-colored sheet.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ms. Muller's biography, Otto Frank had been
intensely in love with a wealthy young woman in Frankfurt whose
parents ruled out the marriage on financial grounds, leaving him
heartbroken and devoid of passion for Edith, as Anne may have
learned.
</P>
<P>
   In the diary revision on the blue sheets, dated Feb. 8, 1944,
when she was 14, Anne, addressing her fictional friend Kitty, talks
about going through a period of reflection centering on her
parents' marriage, always presented to her as ``ideal.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But she says she knows ``a thing or two'' about her father's
past and, supplemented by her imagination, concludes that her
father married her mother because ``he deemed her the right person
to be his wife.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I must say that I admire my mother for the way she has filled
that position without a murmur and without jealousy, as far as I
can tell,'' Anne continues.
</P>
<P>
   Farther along she says, ``Father is not in love, he gives her a
kiss the way he kisses us.''
</P>
<P>
   As for her mother, Anne says: ``Quite possibly because of her
great sacrifice Mother has grown hard and disagreeable toward her
surroundings and, consequently, she will drift further and further
away from the path of love, will gain less and less admiration and,
no doubt, Father will eventually come to realize that because
externally she has never claimed his full love, she has crumbled
away bit by bit internally. She loves him more than anybody else
and it is hard to see this kind of love unanswered time and
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Hence, she says, shouldn't she feel compassion for her mother?
``Should I help her? And my father?''
</P>
<P>
   No, she decides. Her mother has never told Anne about herself,
nor has Anne asked her to; she describes a silence of near
strangers. ``I am unable to talk with her, I cannot look lovingly
into those cold eyes. I cannot, never! _ If she had only one aspect
of an understanding mother, either tenderness or kindness, or
patience or something else, I would keep trying to approach her.
But, as the days go by, I find myself more and more unable to love
this insensitive nature and mocking countenance. Yours Anne.''
</P>
<P>
   The salmon-colored sheet was Anne's revision of an introduction
to the diary. Promising to be a diligent diarist, she says, ``I
shall also take care that nobody can lay hands on it.'' Her parents
and her sister Margot may be confidants, she says, ``yet my diary
and the secrets I share with my friends are none of their
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Anne's diary is really a succession of books and loose pages.
She had been given an autograph book, bound in red-and-green
checkered cloth and secured with a simple key-less lock, for her
13th birthday, on June 12, 1942, a month before the family went
into hiding.
</P>
<P>
   Within six months, Anne had filled the makeshift diary, going on
to a second notebook, which was lost, and two following notebooks.
These became known as version ``A.''
</P>
<P>
   After hearing a Dutch radio broadcast urging citizens to
preserve their histories of the war, Anne, over a period of two and
a half months starting in May 1944, feverishly began revising her
diary, re-writing 324 pages, perhaps as as the basis for a novel.
This became known as version ``B.''
</P>
<P>
   After the annex was raided that August, Anne's writings were
preserved by a downstairs secretary and friend who had bravely kept
their secret, Miep Gies, now 89. When Otto Frank, liberated at the
Auschwitz death camp, returned to Amsterdam and learned that Anne
and her elder sister Margot had died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen
concentration camp in early 1945, weeks before the British
liberation, she presented him the diaries.
</P>
<P>
   Otto Frank released a heavily edited version of ``B'' for its
first publication as ``Anne Frank: Diary of a Young Girl'' in 1947.
That became known as version ``C.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, the Institute for War Documentation in Amsterdam, which
had been given custody of the diaries, published a so-called
critical edition, comparing the versions, with scientific analysis,
to refute any claims they were forgeries.
</P>
<P>
   A footnote to the ``A'' version acknowledged the omission, at
the family's request, of a 47-line segment that gave ``an extremely
unkind and particularly unfair picture of her parents' marriage.''
But in the ``B'' version there was no mention of anything missing _
the 47 lines of revisions Frank withheld.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Doubleday, now part of Random House, came out with a
``definitive edition'' timed to the 50th anniversary of Anne's
death and including 30 percent more material than Otto Frank had
allowed for the originally published ``C'' version. But the
definitive edition also lacked the revised entries that have now
emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Applebaum, senior vice president at Random House, said
``we are as disturbed and nonplussed as anybody'' but said any move
to republish the book with the missing material would have to await
a resolution of the legal claims. ``It's impossible for us to get
beyond the rancor now,'' he said. Doubleday, which has North
American hardcover publication rights to the diary, and Bantam,
which has paperback rights, would not expect to pay additional
money to republish with the new material, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Romijn, head of research for the Institute for War
Documentation, said that as it happened, a new printing of the
critical edition had been planned anyway and now should include the
new material.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Muller said she learned only in June that she would not be
given permission to quote the new material in her book, a decision
she attributed to commercial considerations as well as a misguided
effort to protect Otto Frank.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not terrible that a 36-year-old man may have had an
earlier love,'' she said. Besides, she said, ``I don't care what
their marriage was like. I care about the relationship of mother
and daughter.''

D'AMATO SIGNALS WILLINGNESS TO VOTE FOR CAMPAIGN REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Under intense pressure from Democrats and
government watchdog groups, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, who is running
for re-election this year, has begun signaling a willingness to
switch his vote and support legislation that would overhaul federal
campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   For much of his 18-year Senate career, D'Amato, a New York
Republican who is one of the most aggressive fund-raisers in
Congress, has consistently voted against tightening campaign
finance rules. In the last year, he voted eight times to kill the
Senate campaign finance bill, sponsored by Sens. John McCain,
R-Ariz., and Russell Feingold, D-Wis.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent days, D'Amato has softened his opposition to
changing the rules, saying that he would consider supporting the
McCain-Feingold bill if changes were made to make it more
``balanced.''
</P>
<P>
   ``More work has to be done on Feingold,'' D'Amato said after a
lunch for Republican senators at the Capitol on Tuesday. ``If they
accomplish some changes there, then I might be amenable. But I'm
not now.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato refused to say what those changes might be. But
congressional officials said he was looking for additional
restrictions on campaign activities by labor unions, which have
tended to support Democrats. Proponents of the legislation say such
restrictions are already in the bill.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato has also told associates that he is concerned about
angering anti-abortion groups, which strongly oppose the
McCain-Feingold bill because, they say, it will reduce their impact
on elections. D'Amato is seeking the nomination of New York's Right
to Life Party, which could provide critical votes in a tight race.
</P>
<P>
   In an appeal directed at D'Amato and other fence-sitters,
Feingold said on the Senate floor Wednesday that he would consider
changes to the bill, provided that its ``basic integrity'' was left
intact.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which passed by a large margin in the House
last month, would ban so-called soft money _ unregulated donations
to parties _ and establish additional restrictions on issue
advertisements by independent organizations during the campaign
season.
</P>
<P>
   The first of several votes on the bill in the Senate is expected
to come on Thursday. Though 52 senators support the bill, enough to
pass it, eight more votes are needed to end debate and force a
final vote.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's actions on the McCain-Feingold bill are being closely
watched by both sides in the debate as evidence of shifting
momentum for the bill. ``A D'Amato switch on this first vote could
have a major, major impact on what happens,'' said Ann McBride,
president of Common Cause, a nonprofit watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, a coalition of groups has begun a statewide
campaign intended to pressure D'Amato to support the legislation.
On Wednesday, officials with those groups, which include Common
Cause, Public Citizen, the New York Public Interest Research Group
and the League of Women Voters, held a news conference outside
D'Amato's Senate office in Rochester, N.Y., and met with his aides
in Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   The groups have also been distributing leaflets and operating
phone banks to ask voters to call or write D'Amato to urge him to
vote for the McCain-Feingold bill. The groups have been promoting a
recent poll that shows that the bill is very popular with voters in
both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Wednesday, Campaign for America, a nonprofit group
organized specifically to advocate campaign finance changes, began
running a radio advertisement in several cities in upstate New York
and in the suburbs of New York City, calling on D'Amato to change
his vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a mess in Washington: the investigations, the sleazy
politics,'' the narrator says. ``There is a way to start cleaning
things up. Ban soft money. But our senator, Al D'Amato, won't let
the Senate vote on a soft money ban.''
</P>
<P>
   The three major candidates running in the Democratic primary for
Senate _ Mark Green, Geraldine Ferraro and Rep. Charles Schumer _
support the McCain-Feingold bill and have vowed to make D'Amato's
votes against it a campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   Opposing campaign finance legislation ``is a core value'' for
D'Amato, said Joseph DePlasco, a spokesman for Green, the New York
City public advocate. ``His existence is defined by his position on
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said: ``D'Amato has not passed a major bill on any issue
in 18 years. The only thing he is good at is raising money. And
unfortunately, it seems to affect the way he votes on bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Gaskill, a spokesman for Ferraro, said, ``It's at the
top of our campaign list because it's about buying government.''

 &HT;    Another loss for Braves bullpen
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _Chris Widger's homer in the bottom off the ninth sent
the Montreal Expos to a 3-2 win over the Atlanta Braves Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever John Rocker took the loss for the Braves, who rallied
froma 2-0 deficit to tie the game before Widger's home run.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it was that left Atlanta to start this road trip 1-4
with seven defeats in the last nine games, the Braves seemed to
have the ideal remedy: Tom Glavine, against the Expos, with the
circle change.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 25, 1992 in Atlanta, Glavine took the loss in a 6-0
defeat by Montreal. That was his last loss to the Expos; he'd since
gone 12-0, with a 2.24 ERA in 15 starts. This night, Glavine came
here off a tough 2-1 loss Friday to the Mets but with a chance to
become the NL's first 19-game winner.
</P>
<P>
   But while Glavine pitched well early, the Braves couldn't score
off Dustin Hermanson early. They stranded three runners in scoring
position in the first four innings _ two at third base _ by going
0-for-5. Andruw Jones fanned to end the third with Andres Galarraga
at third. Although Michael Tucker doubled to lead off the third and
Glavine successfully sacrificed, Ozzie Guillen and Marty Malloy
bounced out to strand Tucker. Although Chipper Jones led off the
fourth with a single and stole second as Galarraga struck out,
Hermanson got Ryan Klesko swinging and Javy Lopez on a groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Andruw Jones saved two runs for Glavine by throwing out Widger
at the plate after Orlando Cabrera's single to end the second
inning. In the fourth, Jones' diving catch in right-center held
Expos at first and second and Glavine escaped. Not in the fifth,
though.
</P>
<P>
   What's nearly as bad as issuing a two-out walk? Walking a No. 8
leadoff hitter. Glavine did so in the fifth, Cabrera then advancing
on Hermanson's sacrifice. He scored on Wilton Guerrero's triple.
F.P. Santangelo's single made it 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta loaded the bases in the seventh when Hermanson walked
Klesko leading off, then gave up an infield single to Lopez off the
shortstop Cabrera's glove and a lined single to left to Andruw
Jones. Tucker then bounced to Ryan McGuire, who'd just moved from
left field to first base. McGuire's throw home was low, though, and
Widger had to lunge to his left to scoop the ball. Home plate
umpire C.B. Bucknor ruled Widger's right foot came off the plate
before he had control of the ball _ and that Widger never tagged
Klesko.Pinch-hitter Greg Colbrunn popped out but Guillen's
sacrifice fly tied it 2-2.

 &HT;    On Deck: Montreal Expos
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When: 7:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   TV/radio: Braves Network, 750-AM.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: RHP Kevin Millwood (14-8, 4.41 ERA;
1-1, 6.97 lifetime vs. Expos) vs. RHP Mike Thurman (3-3, 3.97;
first appearance vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Millwood gets his third crack at the Expos after having
decidedly mixed results in the first two. On June 14 in Atlanta, he
pitched his second complete game of the season, beating Montreal
5-1 on a four-hitter that featured seven strikeouts. Five days
later in Montreal, however, Millwood suffered through his shortest
outing of '98. He lasted just 1 1/3 innings and was pounded for
seven hits, including two home runs, and seven earned runs in a
14-1 loss. Since last winning Aug. 14 in Los Angeles, Millwood has
gone four starts without a victory _ two losses followed by two
no-decisions. Atlanta has lost all four times. He took a 4-2 lead
into the bottom of the sixth Saturday in Shea Stadium but couldn't
hold it, allowing three Mets singles that loaded the bases and
signaled Millwood's departure. He gave up seven hits and two earned
runs on John Olerud's two-run homer but was long gone when the Mets
won 5-4. The rookie Thurman makes his 10th start of the season and
gets his first look at the Braves. Opponents are batting just .222
against him, the best mark of any Expo starter.

 &HT;    A contrite Clinton asks for forgiveness
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO _ As the Kenneth Starr report was being delivered to
Congress Wednesday, a contrite President Clinton, bringing tears to
the eyes of some Florida Democrats, asked for forgiveness and
healing.
</P>
<P>
   In an emotional luncheon speech to more than 350 Democrats here,
Clinton said he was moved by a little boy during a stop at
Hillcrest Elementary School near downtown Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shaking the hands of these little kids out there, and
this kid, who reminded me a lot of myself when I was that young _
he was bigger than the other students and kind of husky _ he said,
`Mr. President, I want to grow up to be president. I want to
president like you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In a quieter voice, Clinton said that after hearing the boy, ``I
thought, I want to be able to conduct my life and my presidency so
that all parents of the country could feel good, if their children
were able to say that again. I'll never forget what that little boy
said to me.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, about 10:15 p.m., Clinton called the home of
U.S. Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Boca Raton, to seek advice before coming
to Florida. Wexler, who traveled aboard Air Force One with Clinton,
also spoke privately with him during the flight to Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Wexler, one of Clinton's staunchest defenders, said he urged
Clinton to apologize for his moral transgressions and to deal
forthrightly with the American people. ``We're a fair country,''
Wexler said. ``I think if he's totally honest with the American
people, he'll find out that we have a huge capacity to forgive.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's fund-raising trip to Florida was delayed by several
hours when he called House leaders to the White House Wednesday
morning and talked about the Monica Lewinsky affair. They
apparently gave Clinton similar advice to Wexler and also warned
him that he will be in even worse trouble if he hasn't revealed
everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let you down,'' Clinton told the lunch crowd. ``And I let my
family down. And I let this country down. But I'm trying to make it
right. And I'm determined never to let anything like that happen
again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He made me cry,'' said Carol Milita of Canal Point. ``I think
what the president said was very moving and very heart-felt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he is a very good president and I still support him,''
said Tammy Oliver of Okeechobee, who also dabbed tears from her
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   After his speech, Clinton walked the rope line, posed for
pictures, shook hands and was warmly greeted by a crowd that had
waited for hours to see him. Also waiting for hours was a group of
about 40 protestors outside the hotel waving signs calling for
Clinton to resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why am I here? Because I can't stand Clinton,'' said Clare
Vitale, a retiree from nearby Winter Garden, as she waved a red,
white and blue sign that said ``Resign You Swine.'' Some wore
T-shirts that said, ``Thank God for the vast right wing
conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was in Florida primarily to raise money for the campaign
of Lt. Gov. Buddy MacKay, who is challenging Republican Jeb Bush in
the governor's race. During his introduction of Clinton, MacKay
said he will continue to support him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martin Luther King once said, `In the end we will remember not
the voices of our enemies but the silence of our friends,' '' said
MacKay. ``Mr. President, we're not going to be silent. We are going
to speak out in support of the work you are doing to improve
people's lives in this country.' ''
</P>
<P>
   GOP state chairman Tom Slade showed up at the Marriott before
Clinton and criticized Clinton for his ``self-indulgent conduct.''
He also blasted MacKay for ``so desperately needing campaign money
that he is leaving his moral rudder on the coral rocks,'' by
associating with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton attended a $500 per person lunch in Orlando and a $5,000
per couple dinner in Coral Gables. Robin Rorapaugh, MacKay's
campaign manager, said the events should net about $1 million.
MacKay's campaign has less than half the money that Bush has
raised.
</P>
<P>
   On the political side of his speech, Clinton said Democrats
should be proud of their accomplishments in building a strong
economy, improving health care and balancing the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the people of this country have a serious choice to
make in November,'' Clinton said. ``A choice between progress and
partisanship, people or politics, between unity and division.''
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton's Orlando speech, he flew to Miami and the went to
the Coral Gables Biltmore for a campaign dinner. After dinner he
went to a private home to meet with major Democratic contributors
before returning to Washington.

TEXAS RAPE SUSPECT IDENTIFIED SOLELY ON DNA FROM DATABANK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Texas authorities have identified their first rape
suspect based solely on DNA material stored in a new statewide
databank, Department of Public Safety officials announced
Wednesday. He's a convicted criminal already doing time for a sex
crime, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush and several state lawmakers were on hand as
DPS director Col. Dudley Thomas heralded the development as ``a
great day in the life of DPS and law enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did fingerprints revolutionize (criminal investigations) back
in the '30s?'' asked James B. Francis Jr., chairman of the Texas
Public Safety Commission. ``This is going to change the way we
catch and convict sex offenders.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the databank _ part of a growing national trend to
maintain DNA data on criminals _ would ``unmask repeat offenders''
and send ``a powerful message to would-be offenders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you commit a sexual offense, Texas is going to marshal the
mighty forces of science and technology to find you and put you
behind bars,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Some civil liberties groups and defense lawyers, though, have
challenged the validity of DNA testing as inaccurate and an
invasion of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The break for Texas law enforcement authorities came in a
five-year-old rape case in which the victims _ then 10- and
11-year-old sisters from north Texas _ were attacked at knifepoint
in July 1993 as they played in a dry creek bed. They had not known
their assailant and had been unable to pick a suspect from a photo
lineup that police in their hometown of Granbury had shown them,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Granbury police Detective Bruce Espin said local police followed
conventional investigative methods and could find no suspect.
</P>
<P>
   The case went nowhere until this May when Granbury police,
consulting with Fort Worth authorities on an unrelated case,
learned of the existence of the DNA database maintained by DPS.
</P>
<P>
   DNA evidence obtained from the victims was then compared to
material from 7,500 convicted sex offenders. It was then that
authorities made a ``cold hit'' _ the identification of a suspect,
previously unknown to authorities, based solely on DNA evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have since charged Lester Don Parks, 41, of Coleman,
in central Texas, with two counts of aggravated sexual assault with
a deadly weapon. He is expected to be indicted on those charges
Oct. 1, Espin said.
</P>
<P>
   Parks is serving a 15-year sentence for indecency with a child
in an incident that occurred in 1994 in Coleman County, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas officials said they have had more than 100 ``warm hits''
in which DNA material provided sufficient evidence for police to
charge individuals already known to them or suspected in crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Legislature authorized the creation of the DNA
databank in 1995 as part of a package of sex-offender bills passed
that session. While Bush had called for the creation of the
databank during his 1994 campaign, the Clinton Administration's
1994 Crime Control Act also had called for the establishment of a
nationwide DNA databank, similar to the national system for
fingerprint identification.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, Texas felons convicted of sex-related offenses have
been required to give blood samples for DNA profiling and inclusion
in the state database. Those on probation or parole also must
provide blood samples, if a court orders them to, and some
juveniles also must provide samples of their blood.
</P>
<P>
   DNA is deoxyribonucleic acid, which contains genetic codes and
is a basic material in the chromosomes of the cell nucleus.
</P>
<P>
   The blood samples are then profiled by DPS and entered into the
state's Combined DNA Index System, or CODIS, database.
</P>
<P>
   DPS did not have enough samples in the system to begin trying to
match DNA evidence in unsolved crimes with that from known
offenders until early this year, officials said. DPS now has
biological evidence on file for 7,500 sex offenders. Another 7,000
offenders have given samples that have not yet been processed.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
OPTIONAL END &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Espin said Parks did not immediately confess to the crime, but
admitted to attacking the girls once confronted with the DNA
evidence. Espin acknowledged that Parks was in prison and did not
have a lawyer present when authorities confronted him with the
information.
</P>
<P>
   Espin said Parks told authorities that he had been to Granbury
only once, the day he saw the little girls playing in a dry creek
bed.
</P>
<P>
   Espin said the family later moved from Granbury, but when he
notified them that authorities had charged a suspect, they were
tearful and grateful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though they had moved from our area ... they were still
afraid that he could find them,'' Espin said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Todd, spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal
Justice, said prison officials have not had difficulty getting
blood samples for DNA evidence from sex offenders because TDCJ
automatically gets blood samples from each prisoner who enters the
system. Not all of the blood samples are kept, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've not had a problem with inmates giving blood once,'' Todd
said. ``But some of them, when they read about this new process,
could be reluctant to give a second time.''

DANCING IN THE DARK  
 NOT JANET JACKSON CALLING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAMES BARRON with CHARLES STRUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Once in a while a waiter will drop a tray of
dishes,'' said Kathleen Landis, a cabaret singer. ``I just sing
right through it.''
</P>
<P>
   So last Friday evening, when the lights went out at her home
base, the Cafe Pierre, Ms. Landis, whose current show celebrates
George Gershwin, knew exactly what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I switched to Dietz and Schwartz,'' she said. ```Dancing in
the Dark.'''
</P>
<P>
   Picture this: It's 11 p.m., and Ms. Landis, wearing a black
1950s Christian Dior gown with a V-shaped back cut to the waist,
was well into her third set when an electrical problem (eventually
traced to renovation work) left the room in darkness, except for
tiny tabletop candles and a candelabrum on the piano.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long, long room, like being on the Orient Express,''
Ms. Landis said Wednesday. ``When the lights went out the room took
on an incredibly romantic mood.''
</P>
<P>
   It had been a full house of about 75 people, she said. At first
there was some nervous tittering. Then people got up to dance.
Raising her soft alto to compensate for the loss of a microphone,
she played and sang requests: ``No Moon at All,'' and ``Beginning
to See the Light.'' She said there was an increase in handholding.
</P>
<P>
   The cafe's assistant manager, Mario Garro, took larger candles
to some tables. Drinks continued to be served for a while, but
shortly before midnight, the management decided that discretion was
the better part of entertainment. To avoid having someone stumble
dangerously out of the hotel too late in the night, Ms. Landis'
show was brought to an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the regulars came back the next night,'' Ms. Landis
said. ``They were hoping for a replay. It didn't happen, but they
decided to stay anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity Hunting of Another Sort
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Flynn averted the Janet Jackson hoax. Now the MTV Video
Music Awards can go on.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Flynn is in charge of the 6,251 audience tickets for the
program, which will be broadcast Thursday night from the Universal
Amphitheatre in Los Angeles. This makes her an arbiter (of which
celebrities should be given seats the cameras can see, for example)
and a detective. Are people requesting tickets the celebrities they
say they are, or are they impostors, like the woman who called from
London on Tuesday claiming to be Miss Jackson?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Flynn has 300 more seats to assign than last year, when the
awards were at Radio City Music Hall, a short walk from her office
overlooking Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought moving the show to L.A. would make it easier, but it
hasn't,'' she said. ``Paramount's in L.A.,'' she added, referring
to the film-production company that, like MTV, is a unit of Viacom,
``and we have double the sponsors, and there are only so many
front-row seats.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Flynn flew to Los Angeles on Saturday to make the final
decisions on who would sit where, which involves juggling requests
from officials at MTV who want seats for producers and advertisers,
and from the award program's producers, who make last-minute
arrangements for big-name stars to appear on the broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``You dream where you take the tickets and dump them on
somebody's desk and say, `Here, you figure it out,''' she said. And
then there are the celebrities. ``We always get the phone call that
Bruce Springsteen wants tickets,'' she said. ``We need to make sure
we're not turning down Bruce Springsteen.'' Ms. Flynn knew, from
another MTV promotion she has been working on, that Miss Jackson
was scheduled to be in Texas and Florida, not California, this
week.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not always so easy. She learned the importance of
double-checking several years ago, after a man called and
introduced himself as Patrick Swayze.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so proud I got the call,'' she said. ``He said he was in
town making `Dirty Dancing 2.' I said, `So awesome.' I saved
second-row center. He sat right where the winners come down the
aisle. I felt foolish.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S.: Patrick Swayze wasn't in town and there was no ``Dirty
Dancing 2.''

PHIL GOULDING, 77, PENTAGON SPOKESMAN CAUGHT IN VIETNAM WEB 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., N.Y., Ohio, Calif.)   (bl)  
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Phil G. Goulding, a Pentagon spokesman who
unknowingly passed along encouraging but false reports about U.S.
progress in the Vietnam War and later wrote a book urging officials
to press for accurate information from the military, died Sept. 8
at his home in Potomac, Md. He was 77 and also had a home in
Brainardsville, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was brain cancer, his son Kent said.
</P>
<P>
   Author David Halberstam, who covered the war for The New York
Times, said Wednesday that Goulding was the innocent he was because
he was used by people in the field whose mission was to put the
U.S. position in a better light.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great lying machine, and he was at the tail end of
it,'' Halberstam said. ``I think he got sucked up into the vortex
of that thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Goulding spoke of his role in a 1970 book, ``Confirm or Deny:
Informing the People on National Security'' (Harper &AMP; Row),
writing:
</P>
<P>
   ``I misled and misinformed the American people a good many times
in a good many ways _ through my own lack of foresight, through
carelessness, through relaying incomplete information which the
originators considered complete, through transmitting reports which
had been falsified, deliberately, at lower levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Another instance involved the strafing of a Soviet vessel in a
North Vietnamese port.
</P>
<P>
   Goulding was misled into telling reporters that the ship had not
been attacked by a U.S. plane, said Neil Sheehan, another author
and reporter who covered the war for United Press International and
The Times.
</P>
<P>
   Goulding was born in San Francisco and graduated from Hamilton
College. His son said he entered the Navy in World War II and rose
to the rank of lieutenant (j.g.).
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he joined The Cleveland Plain Dealer as a
reporter, eventually obtaining an assignment to the paper's
Washington bureau. He joined the Defense Department in 1965 and
became its chief spokesman in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the Defense Department in 1969, Goulding joined a
consulting firm and in 1975 became vice president of the American
Petroleum Institute, a trade group. He retired in 1990 and began a
second career writing and lecturing about classical music.
</P>
<P>
   His first marriage, to Ann Wright Goulding, ended in divorce in
1977.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Miriam Bower Goulding; five children
from his first marriage, Kent, of Potomac, Barry, of Bethesda, Md.,
Philip, of Barrington, Ill., Laura Jacoby, of Derwood, Md., and
Nancy Swanberg of Worcester, Mass., and seven grandchildren.

LIKE RUSSIA, TEA ROOM'S IN A HOLE, BUT ERA OF CZARS IS COMING

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Russian Tea Room? Potemkin Village is more like it.
</P>
<P>
   With none of the fanfare once typical of the fabled restaurant
at 150 W. 57th St., most of the structure has been demolished in
recent weeks, leaving almost nothing standing but the ornate
brownstone facade.
</P>
<P>
   A new six-story Russian Tea Room, developed by restaurateur
Warner LeRoy, is to rise on the site, slightly to the east of
Carnegie Hall between Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue.
For now, one can see patches of sky through the open windows in
what is left of the facade.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled to open next year, the restaurant will have a
140-seat, ground-floor dining room that is meant to evoke the 1927
original _ with samovars, Christmas ornaments, chandeliers,
paintings, booths, bar, green walls and all.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the decor will be new and novel. A 140-seat dining
room on the second and third floors will be decorated in 1930s
Russian modernist style, with a revolving 15-foot crystal acrylic
bear that will double as an aquarium for young sturgeon and an
18-foot tree bearing Faberge-like eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Above that, on the fourth and fifth levels, will be a 300-seat
private dining room decorated in Russian imperial style, with the
stained-glass ceiling taken from LeRoy's restaurant Maxwell's Plum,
which closed in 1988. Above that, on the sixth level, will be a
200-seat banquet room with a diorama at the rear depicting the
Kremlin during the reign of the czars.
</P>
<P>
   LeRoy, the proprietor of Tavern on the Green in Central Park,
has planned a new Tea Room since he acquired the business from
Faith Stewart-Gordon and closed the original in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   He said Wednesday that the long delay had nothing to do with the
legal battles he has had with his former partner, restaurateur
David Bouley, or with his current divorce proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has only to do with a very, very complicated site,'' LeRoy
said. ``It is now under way, full blast.'' He would not disclose
the cost and said he was contractually prohibited from naming his
new partner.
</P>
<P>
   The new building will be about 15 feet taller than the original,
and it will be clad in stucco, with marble trim and bronze-framed
windows. It has been designed by Harman Jablin Architects. About
the ground floor, LeRoy said, ``I'm really trying to make it as
close to the way it was as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   That will be a challenge, said those who knew the original.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most imposing presence there was the room itself,'' said
Dan Cronin, a waiter at the Tea Room from 1985 to 1995. ``There was
history in the room. Nureyev would would walk in and stop time,
just with his entrance.''
</P>
<P>
   David Walentas, a real estate developer who lives a block away
and used to go in for borscht, said, ``I loved the old Russian Tea
Room just as it was.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The seediness of it would be tough to recreate,'' he said.
``It's the nicks and the bangs and the plaster peeling and the worn
leather banquettes. It's all that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Another neighbor, Leona Johnpoll, looks forward to the day when
she no longer has to tell tourists who ask her how to find the
Russian Tea Room, ``I'm sorry to tell you it just isn't there
anymore.''

WORLD ENERGY COUNCIL RED FACED OVER CLINTON'S CANCELLATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MICHAEL DAVIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ President Clinton's cancellation of an appearance at
next week's World Energy Council Congress in Houston is an
embarrassment to the country, the chairman of the international
energy event says.
</P>
<P>
   The 5,000 participants expected to attend this forum for the
leaders of the international energy industry include the presidents
of Argentina and Turkey, 20 energy ministers and numerous chief
executives from global energy companies.
</P>
<P>
   There also will be some high-ranking administration officials
here, such as Energy Secretary Bill Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Programs for the event, mailed out a few weeks ago, said Clinton
would be leading the opening ceremonies at 3 p.m. Sunday in the
George R. Brown Convention Center in downtown Houston. Late last
week, however, representatives of the congress began letting it be
known that Clinton would not be making an appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the World Energy Council issued a terse
two-paragraph release stating that former President Bush would be
the featured speaker at the opening ceremonies. No mention was made
of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a lot to keep (Clinton) on board,'' said Don Jordan,
chief executive of Houston Industries and the chairman of this
congress. ``The embarrassing thing about it for me and the United
States is that, during the history of this event, it has always
been opened by the head of state, and we made a strong point of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the 17th such event held in the past 75 years. Since
1968, the congress has been held every three years. Prior to that,
it was held in six-year intervals.
</P>
<P>
   A White House source said Wednesday that administration
officials had not confirmed Clinton's appearance at the event, and
that the group's organizers jumped the gun in announcing his
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at the meeting when it was discussed, and it was never
on (Clinton's) calendar,'' the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Since its inception in 1923, Jordan said, every congress of the
World Energy Council has been opened by the head of state of the
host country. This congress marks the first break with that
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton had this on his agenda for quite a while; we
first invited him about two years ago,'' Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Houstonian Lloyd Bentsen, a former secretary of the Treasury in
the Clinton cabinet, personally delivered the invitation, Jordan
said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the ball went over the fence Tuesday night _ and
there is no longer any need to say which ball or which fence _ it
shot into a dark utility space, perhaps the only gray area in the
whole sunlit spectacle of this year's home-run daydream. Watching
it go, feeling the old stirring once again, Don DeLillo briefly
hoped the ball was truly lost somewhere in the darkness, perhaps
rolling down history's drainpipe into lasting mystery.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would have been interesting,'' he said Wednesday,
cherishing the mischief of the notion.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not to be, and DeLillo knows the century too well to
believe otherwise. In 1951, the ball that Bobby Thomson hit out of
the Polo Grounds disappeared forever into the crowd and lodged in
DeLillo's imagination, becoming a holy relic of memory that appears
at significant moments of ``Underworld,'' his acclaimed Cold War
novel of last fall. The ball, quietly changing hands over the
decades, winds up on the shelf of the novel's protagonist, who
fondles its curves and seams at 4 a.m. to summon the past.
</P>
<P>
   This year's ball, transfigured by Mark McGwire's bat, was marked
with an infrared identifying code and immediately retrieved by a
groundskeeper for the St. Louis Cardinals, who moments later told a
live television audience that he would forgo the memorabilia market
and return it to McGwire and the Hall of Fame. For this generosity,
he was quickly invested with the trappings of modern sainthood: a
free trip to Disneyworld, a meeting with the president and even an
appearance on David Letterman's show.
</P>
<P>
   DeLillo, whose explorations of America's waste places and dark
compulsions have made him one of the country's premier novelists,
finds this selflessness laudatory, but believes the neatly packaged
moments are finally impoverishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every baseball carries with it the history of the game, in a
mysterious way that you don't find in football or tennis or
basketball,'' he said, speaking as a lifetime Yankee fan who grew
up in the Belmont section of the Bronx, his team's home borough.
``People have scrambled over baseballs, fought over baseballs, and
the wonderful mystery of the Bobby Thomson home-run ball is in part
what prompted me to write `Underworld.' If we knew who had that
baseball, it's possible I never would have begun work on the
novel.''
</P>
<P>
   It is mystery that feeds the imagination, and it is mystery, he
believes, that is being drained from the public arena, with its
multiple camera shots, instant replays and snap moral judgments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to know everything and we want to show everything,''
he said. ``It's all ultimately a function of technology. In the
days of Thomson and Ralph Branca, there was no videotape. The home
run could not be shown repeatedly, it could not be exhausted by
midnight of the first day. I think that in part accounts for the
longevity of that ball game, because it was not consumed so
instantly and so readily. The newsreel footage looks like something
out of World War I, and there's something precious about this
fact.''
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, DeLillo believes that McGwire's triumph will
eventually fade in the public mind faster than Thomson's, blurred
by the repetition that he calls ``an offense against memory.'' What
may last, however, is McGwire's gesture across time, reaching back
to 1961 with his embrace in the stands of the family of Roger
Maris, the Yankee who was the longtime record-holder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a wonderful gesture,'' said DeLillo, who, like
McGwire's father, is 61 years old. ``It was so interesting to see
how closely the sons resembled Maris himself. One's memory of Maris
is of a haunted face with sunken eyes, perhaps in part because he
is still to us a figure in black and white rather than in four
colors. I can picture Maris in his Cardinal uniform in color, but
as a Yankee, he's permanently part of my black-and-white memory.''
</P>
<P>
   The power of memory is one of DeLillo's great themes, and he
talks of it easily, in flowing descriptive sentences with long
silences in between, unafraid to be seen thinking carefully before
he speaks. Though he dislikes interviews and seemed physically
pained by a camera's lens a few inches from his face, he readily
agreed to talk about baseball, not as a tired literary metaphor for
American life but as a portal that Americans have traditionally
used to transcend their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The race to overtake Maris is the ``bright side'' of the
country's obsession with fame and wealth and spectacle, he said,
the antidote to the depressing scandalous news from Washington. He
has known of this power since his childhood pickup games on the
streets of St. Martin's parish, since that day in 1951 when he saw
so much of the city kindle in exuberance after Thomson's famous
pennant-winning home run. (Actually, he was sitting in his
dentist's chair at the time, but he still remembers.)
</P>
<P>
   He lives in Westchester now, working on a play called
``Valparaiso'' that soon will open in Boston, occasionally dipping
into his favorite restaurants on Arthur Avenue and letting himself
drift into monochrome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to Cardinal Hayes High School, which is in very easy
walking distance of Yankee Stadium,'' he said. ``I remember one
afternoon, in October, hearing a strange sound, a little like surf,
and wondering what it was. And later I realized it was the sound
made by the crowd at Yankee Stadium when Tommy Henrich hit a
late-inning home run. It was against the Dodgers.''

STARR DELIVERS REPORT TO CONGRESS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
and GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Independent counsel Kenneth Starr on Wednesday
delivered to Congress a lengthy report detailing ``substantial and
credible'' evidence of possible impeachable offenses by President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Arrival of the politically explosive report and two van loads of
supporting documents will set in motion, for the first time since
Watergate, a formal constitutional process that could lead to
Clinton's removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   The report was delivered as the president, in meetings with
House Democrats and at fund-raisers in Florida, offered his most
expansive public apologies yet for his affair with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky and for lying about it for seven
months.
</P>
<P>
   With only 15 minutes of advance warning from Starr, his deputies
arrived at the Capitol and formally turned over two copies of the
report to the House of Representatives shortly after 4 p.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
   As tourists, janitors and some House members watched, Capitol
police officers transferred the reports and 36 sealed boxes of
supporting material from two vans into two other recreational
vehicles, then to the Ford Office Building.
</P>
<P>
   House Sergeant-at-Arms Wilson Livingood put the documents under
lock and key until the House decides _ possibly on Friday _ how to
make much of the information public, and how it will be reviewed to
determine whether to schedule formal impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The office of independent counsel submitted a referral to the
House of Representatives containing substantial and credible
information that may constitute grounds for impeachment of the
president of the United States,'' Starr spokesman Charles Bakaly
said outside the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have fulfilled our duty,'' Bakaly said, declining to
discuss the contents of the report. ``Responsibility for the
information we have transmitted today and for any further action
now lie with the Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr's long-awaited report contains evidence from his
eight-month investigation of Clinton's affair with Lewinsky and
allegations that he lied under oath, obstructed justice, tampered
with witnesses and abused his power to keep the relationship
secret.
</P>
<P>
   The report runs almost 450 pages, including a 25-page
introduction, a narrative of the Clinton-Lewinsky relationship and
attempts to cover it up, and a 140-page discussion of possible
grounds for impeachment. The report was not expected to include any
information regarding Whitewater, missing billing records or misuse
of FBI files, allegations also under investigation by Starr's team
of prosecutors, who are scheduled to meet with the grand jury
today.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's personal attorney David Kendall, whose request for a
preview of the report was rejected by Starr, said the information
delivered to the House includes ``no basis for impeachment.'' The
documents ``represent only the prosecutor's allegations,
allegations that we have been denied a chance to review,'' said
Kendall, who reportedly was preparing a legal challenge that could
have delayed Starr's report.
</P>
<P>
   In a one-page letter to House Speaker Newt Gingrich and
Democratic leader Richard Gephardt, Starr seemed to caution that
documents accompanying the report contain graphic details of the
president's White House trysts with Lewinsky. ``Many of the
supporting materials contain information of a personal nature that
I respectfully urge the House to treat as confidential,'' Starr
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Attached to Starr's letter was a copy of a July 7 court order
giving him permission to provide the House with the report, along
with secret grand jury testimony supporting his findings of
impeachable acts by the president. Starr had sought permission from
the three-judge panel on July 2, two weeks before he subpoenaed the
president and three weeks before Lewinsky testified to the grand
jury.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said no one would be allowed to see the documents until
the House adopts rules for considering whether Starr's report does
indeed contain sufficient evidence of wrongdoing for the House to
begin a formal impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Gingrich and House Judiciary Committee
Chairman Henry Hyde, whose committee probably will be the first to
review Starr's report, said as much information as possible should
be made public as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public has a right to know,'' said Gingrich, a Georgia
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, an Illinois Republican, said, ``It is time that we begin
the process of putting this issue behind us, and public release of
the report in due course will help us embark upon that process.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt pushed for providing Clinton and his attorneys with a
copy of the report before it is made public. ``The president
deserves the opportunity at the earliest possible moment to be able
to put his version ... of the facts in front of the American
people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, Hyde, Gephardt and other House leaders met privately
several times Wednesday and agreed to set aside partisanship on the
subject of impeachment. ``This is a very serious constitutional
question,'' Gingrich said, adding that it should be considered with
``the greatest sense of concern and ... the greatest and deepest
sense of patriotism.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt told reporters after one session that he was confident
that the House had ``made a good start'' at providing a fair review
of Starr's report. ``Next to declaring war, this may be the most
important thing that we do, so we have to do it right. We have to
do it objectively, fairly, and in a nonpartisan way,'' the Missouri
Democrat said.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde was adamant that he would ``not condone nor participate in
a political witch-hunt'' if his committee decides to conduct formal
impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The solemn duty that confronts us requires that we attain a
heroic level of bipartisanship and that we conduct our
deliberations in a fair, full and independent manner,'' Hyde said.
``Politics must be checked at the door, party affiliation must
become secondary, and America's future must become our only
concern.''
</P>
<P>
   The House has impeached only one president _ Andrew Johnson in
1868. When his trial was moved to the Senate, he was acquitted by a
single vote. In 1974, the House Judiciary Committee voted articles
of impeachment against Richard Nixon over Watergate, but he
resigned before any action was taken by the full House.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, where Clinton has drawn rebukes from Democratic
allies during the past week, West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd warned
against a rush to judgment of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, the senior Democrat in the Senate, urged lawmakers to
``step back and give our country a little pause in which to reflect
and meditate before we cast ourselves headlong over the
precipice.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd then added his own criticism of Clinton's behavior. ``Many
of the mistakes that President Nixon made are being made all over
again,'' he said. Clinton has ``sown the wind, and now he is
reaping the whirlwind.''
</P>
<P>
   Early Wednesday, the president kicked off a series of meetings
designed to shore up support among Democrats and his Cabinet by
apologizing for the Lewinsky affair and for misleading them for
seven months.
</P>
<P>
   The first session was with nine House Democratic leaders, who
cautioned him against withholding information _ no matter how
damaging _ that might be revealed in Starr's report. ``There can be
no surprises,'' said Rep. Robert Menendez, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Chet Edwards, a Waco Democrat at the White House meeting,
told the president to shed his lawyers, his staff and pollsters,
``then go directly to the American people'' and express his regrets
and request forgiveness. ``At a minimum, he must do that,'' Edwards
said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Clinton has scheduled a similar session with top
Democrats in the Senate. Later, he has scheduled a meeting of his
Cabinet.

THE CLINTONS AS REMINDERS OF BETRAYAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)  (lb) 
 By JANE GROSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTPORT, Conn. _ Janis Abrahms Spring's office has three green
plush chairs arranged in a triangle. One is for the therapist, one
for the ``unfaithful partner'' and one for the ``hurt partner,'' to
use terminology developed by Dr. Spring during two decades of
treating couples sundered by infidelity.
</P>
<P>
   The chairs have been empty for most of the last three weeks, as
Dr. Spring vacationed in China. That, in itself, is not unusual
since August abandonment is a ritual of therapy, a bitter reminder
that even the rich and the near-rich in Fairfield County cannot
always have what they want exactly when they want it.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Spring has never left in circumstances as charged as
those of this summer, when each day brought new episodes in the
drama of infidelity unfolding in the White House. The president's
hedged confession. The tie from Monica. The family vacation. The
belated ``I'm sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   So here was Dr. Spring, still daffy from jet lag, with longtime
patients all but banging on the door with pent-up agitation and new
patients clamoring to be seen after sudden marital confrontations.
Not to mention talk-show hosts trying to lure her into their
studios to analyze the first family _ another pundit for hire.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Spring is a clinical supervisor in the department of
psychology at Yale University and author of a self-help manual,
``After the Affair.'' She has carved out a niche very much her own,
guiding couples through the thicket of emotions after the
revelation of adultery, through the process of deciding whether to
stay or leave and the ordeal of rebuilding trust.
</P>
<P>
   Her patients, after weeks of seeing their lives reflected back
at them as if in a fun-house mirror, were in a turmoil by her
return. Some people have been titillated by current events and
others, if they are to be believed, bored; but Dr. Spring's
patients were inundated with unwelcome memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the problem of the hurt partner is being obsessed with
details of the affair,'' the therapist said. ``Obsession is
draining. They feel they've lost control of their mind. Now, if
they manage to distract themselves for even a few minutes, they're
bombarded by the news. Their minds are so invaded as it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the details to emerge in recent weeks have struck like a
knife in the heart of couples torn by adultery, usually committed
by the man. When is an apology sincere and when is it, in Dr.
Spring's words, ``shallow, very much from the teeth up''?
</P>
<P>
   What about gifts to and from the lover? It is ``absolutely
required'' that they be returned or destroyed, Dr. Spring responds.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the constant reiteration that the Clintons and
the country must ``move on''? ``Nothing sets a woman off faster,''
Dr. Spring said after the first wave of post-Labor Day patients had
made the pilgrimage to her office past nurseries banked with
russett chrysanthemums. ``The idea of moving on _ men have a
tendency to use that expression. You can't move on. You can only
move through.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebuilding a marriage after adultery demands letting go of
hardened roles as the betrayed and the betrayer. But Dr. Spring now
sees that her patients have fallen into such roles as they have
obsessively followed, or stubbornly ignored, the latest news
developments.
</P>
<P>
   The women can't pull themselves from the television set, painful
though it may be. The men want to pretend that nothing is amiss and
can't understand their wives' preoccupation. How much better, Dr.
Spring said, if the aggrieved spouse could put down the remote
control and the adulterer could use the news as a way to comment on
his own family's ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hurt partner is broadcasting it, literally, to keep it
alive,'' Dr. Spring said. ``She is saying, I need to know you're
thinking about this, too. If the unfaithful partner would watch
with her, it would send a message of `You're not alone in this _ I
know I've created this mess, and I want us to talk about it
together.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Spring, a slight and intense woman who is married to her
second husband, grabbed a pad and jotted a note to herself.
</P>
<P>
   Her technique includes role-playing exercises that encourage
empathy, better communications and revision of false assumptions.
Now a new exercise seemed to be germinating in her mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reversing roles while you watch TV!'' she crowed. ``The hurt
partner works to let it go, and the unfaithful partner works to
show they haven't forgotten. It's a great idea. It's not natural,
but it's exactly what has to happen.''

REYNOSO LEADS METS OVER PHILLIES, 6-2 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ With his assortment of pitches and deliveries,
Armando Reynoso kept the opposing hitters guessing about what he
would throw. Before each delivery Wednesday night, he looked more
like an aging batting-practice pitcher than the Mets' rapidly
emerging ace. But once he let fly, he was masterly. Reynoso
confounded the Philadelphia Phillies with off-speed pitches that
had them furious, not at called strikes, but at swinging strikes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For eight innings, Reynoso shut out the Phillies before
surrendering a two-run homer to Scott Rolen in the ninth. But his
effort was good enough to carry the Mets to a 6-2 victory over the
Phillies at Veterans Stadium. Dennis Cook came on to get two outs
before John Franco was called on to get the final out. The victory
erased the memory of Tuesday night's embarrassing 16-4 loss here
and kept the Mets on pace with the Chicago Cubs in the race for the
National League wild card. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mets manager Bobby Valentine was not around to watch the end of
this game, having been ejected by the third-base umpire, Joe West,
in the eighth inning after disputing a checked-swing third-strike
call to Tony Phillips. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Mets took the field aware that the Cubs had won a 4-2
decision over the Pittsburgh Pirates. They needed a victory to
remain even with Chicago in the race for the National League's
wild-card berth with only 16 games left for each team after
Wednesday night. With Reynoso (7-1) at the top of his game, that
was never in doubt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 32-year-old right-hander continued his dominance of opposing
hitters since returning to the Mets after spending nearly a year
recovering from elbow and shoulder surgery. Since a blowout loss at
San Francisco, Reynoso has recovered nicely, surrendering only four
hits and one run in eight innings against San Diego in his last
start, and cruising through the Phillies' batting order Wednesday
night after Philadelphia had set a club record for home runs in the
game Tuesday night. Those performances may have cemented Reynoso's
place in the rotation should the Mets reach the playoffs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday night's 14-6 loss to the Phillies, the Mets
threatened in the first inning, but wasted the opportunity and then
were blown out before they could score. Wednesday night, they again
started quickly, only this time they pushed runs across the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Phillips led off the game with a ground-rule double.
Edgardo Alfonzo was then hit in the ear flap of his helmet with a
90 mile-an-hour fastball by Curt Schilling. He was dazed
momentarily but able to remain in the game. John Olerud followed
with a single to left, and Phillips came around on a single to
right by Mike Piazza. Alfonzo trotted home on a sacrifice fly by
Brian McRae. The Mets, however, left the bases loaded, and stranded
three more runners over the next two innings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the two runs stood until the Mets began to chip away at
Schilling. Reynoso surrendered only one hit over the first three
innings, a first-inning double to Marlon Anderson, who had homered
in his only other major league at-bat on Tuesday. But Reynoso then
set down nine straight hitters, including Anderson. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Mets added a run on a single by Alfonzo and a two-out double
by Olerud in the fourth inning. &QL;

`RENT' CREATOR'S ESTATE SETTLES SUIT OVER AUTHORSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the finale of a long-running legal drama, Lynn
Thomson, the woman who had claimed partial authorship of the hit
show ``Rent,'' has reached an out-of-court settlement with the
estate of the musical's creator, Jonathan Larson, whom she has sued
twice.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement includes a undisclosed amount of money and a
credit for Ms. Thomson as dramaturge on the title page of the
``Rent'' playbill, lawyers for both parties said. The settlement
was first reported in Wednesday's New York Post.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Smith, a lawyer for Ms. Thomson, said the terms of the
agreement prohibited him from divulging precise details, but added
that the Post's report of a payment of several hundred thousand
dollars was ``inaccurate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All the issues have been resolved to her satisfaction,'' said
Smith. ``The purpose of all of this was not to gloat but to achieve
justice. We feel we've done that.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Parcher, lawyer for Larson's estate, characterized the
agreement differently, as a voluntary act of generosity spurred by
the Larson family's desire to put to rest the legal battle. ``It
was them saying, `Let's be gracious, and get out of here,''' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the terms, both sides said the settlement apparently
brings to an end an acrimonious two-year struggle over authorship
of the hit musical, which chronicles the AIDS-shadowed lives of
group of artists and squatters on the Lower East Side. The show,
which had its premiere at the New York Theater Workshop in early
1996, transferred to Broadway a year later and is still playing to
sold-out houses. In addition to the New York production and two
North American tours, ``Rent'' has been produced in London and will
open soon in Australia, Japan, and Finland.
</P>
<P>
   Larson, 35, died of a heart aneurysm the night after the show's
1996 opening.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1996, Ms. Thomson sued in federal court in Manhattan
for recognition and a share of profits from the show, which court
papers said might amount to some $250 million over the years. A
year later, Judge Lewis Kaplan ruled that while Ms. Thomson had
contributed some copyrightable material to the musical, she could
not claim authorship, or by extent, any author's royalties. That
judgment was later upheld by an appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   But in June, Ms. Thomson filed another civil suit against a raft
of defendants associated with the show seeking to halt the use of
the limited amounts of copyrightable material the court had
validated. If Ms. Thomsen prevailed, the producers could have been
required to remove lines from the script.
</P>
<P>
   The cases have raised issues in the theatrical community about
the ill-defined position of the dramaturge, whose duties can run
from giving notes to actors to full-scale restructuring of scripts.
Ms. Thomson claimed to have produced up to a quarter of the
musical's book, or dialogue, and about 10 percent of its music.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thomson, who was paid $2,000 for her work, did not return
calls to her home for comment.
</P>
<P>
   While Parcher admitted that Ms. Thomson had had some input, he
rejected her estimation of her impact on the script.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lynn Thomson is not the author or co-author of ``Rent,''' he
said. ``She was helpful, but Jonathan Larson wrote ``Rent.'''

BLOCKBUSTER TO RENT DVD   MOVIES AT 500 LOCATIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Home video giant Blockbuster, in a major
endorsement of the digital versatile disc format, has announced it
will begin renting DVD players and titles at 500 stores by the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The program, unveiled Wednesday, will enable customers to try
out the much hyped format at minimal cost. Starting this month,
stores will rent Philips players for no more than $15 and offer 350
rental and 150 for-sale titles. Bare-bones DVD players currently
retail for about $300.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal with Blockbuster is a very key move in the rollout,''
said Thomas Adams, president of Adams Media Research. ``Before
people buy DVD, they've got to see it and then compare it with
their cable feed.''
</P>
<P>
   The stores, representing more than 10 percent of the chain's
domestic outlets, will include kiosks for demonstrating DVD.
</P>
<P>
   DVD discs, which are the same size as audio compact discs, offer
digital clarity, six-channel sound, massive background information
and don't require rewinding. Adams projects 1 million players in
American homes by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Blockbuster, a major factor in the rise of parent Viacom Inc.
this year, began testing DVD products in about 100 stores in April
1997 shortly after the format's launch. It said outlets in the Los
Angeles market would be included in the DVD program but gave no
locations.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said Blockbuster's move is reminiscent of the early days
of videocassette recorders 20 years ago when stores began renting
VCRs to customers, a step that helped lead to massive acceptance of
the technology.
</P>
<P>
   DVD sales are expected to be strong during the upcoming holiday
season with expanded offerings from discount retailers like Target,
Kmart and Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believer the format faces competition in the short term
from the rival Divx pay-per-view format and, over the long term,
from digital cable TV. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Unshaven and unintimidated by the gale force wind
that menaced the U.S. Open, Patrick Rafter projected an aura of
utter fearlessness. He looked like a warrior, his grizzled face
smeared with white war paint (zinc oxide) as he manhandled the
12th-seeded Jonas Bjorkman, 6-2, 6-3, 7-5, Wednesday in a
quarterfinal match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't play much better than that; I volleyed really well,
served really well, I could go on,'' said the pleased Rafter, who,
being a modest sort, preferred not to catalog everything he did
right against Bjorkman in order to remain on a collision course
with another Slam warrior, the four-time champion Pete Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday it was left to the loser, a member of the Open's first
trio of Swedish quarterfinalists since 1985, to lavish praise on
the winner: ``He was returning and passing better than I have ever
seen; at least that's what he told me, that it was probably his
best match he ever played,'' said Bjorkman, who has seen plenty of
Rafter's flash and dash during their stint as doubles partners.
</P>
<P>
   On the same drafty stadium court where Rafter, the defending
Open champion, used a panoramic display of all-court aggression to
attain the semifinal round, Venus Williams, who aspires to be a
defending Open champion, dared to bare her midriff to the elements
last night and used a similar onslaught of power to blast her way
past Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain, 2-6, 6-1, 6-1. The victory
moved the excited Williams into an all-American semifinal against
the power broker Lindsay Davenport, who leads their rivalry by 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an all-American semifinal now, and that means an American
will be in the final and that's what America wants,'' announced
Williams, who wanted the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Bjorkman said he bore no grudges for the thrashing he received
from Rafter, who took care to holler ``Sorry, mate'' across the net
whenever the wind forced him to replay his service tosses. ``It's
another day at the office, and the best guy wins,'' Bjorkman said.
``That's the way to keep friendship, a good partnership, alive.''
</P>
<P>
   The third-seeded Rafter packed acrobatics and artistry into his
all-out attack on Bjorkman, who had beaten him in four of their six
prior meetings but was little more than a stage prop on the Arthur
Ashe Stadium during the 1-hour-54-minute contest. When Bjorkman
dared to rush the net, Rafter used him for target practice. When
Bjorkman delivered first serves, Rafter sent them back to the
corners for winners. When Bjorkman tried to bury his shots at
Rafter's feet, the Australian picked them from his shoestrings and
volleyed his way out of no man's land. While Bjorkman fought the
ball, Rafter controlled it so well he seemed to have taken it to
obedience school before the match.
</P>
<P>
   For Rafter, the opportunity to become the first first-time Open
champion to return and retain his title since another
serve-and-volley stylist, Stefan Edberg, performed the feat in
1991-92, is no longer an abstraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel very light within myself, and when I move well, I
play well,'' said Rafter, who has cut out the nightly beer runs to
SoHo and honed in on what can happen if he keeps moving in the
right direction for two more rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to win another one,'' he said. ``But I don't have to,
this one-Slam wonder thing,'' said Rafter, referring to a barb John
McEnroe sent his way this spring. ``Maybe a one-match wonder would
hurt me, but for me, it's a big achievement just to win one Slam.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rafter's Grand Slam performances since his breakthrough here a
year ago had been anticlimactic at best, a fourth-round loss to Tim
Henman at Wimbledon, and dismal at worst, a second-round loss to
his less-celebrated countryman, Jason Stoltenberg, at the French
Open. Rafter was so disconsolate at the start of the summer that it
took a series of inspirational faxes from John Newcombe, who
married constructive criticism with plain old rah-rah backslapping,
to nudge him into this 23-2 summer hardcourts campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newk just happened to hit the right spot at the right time,
and I was ready to listen; I was coming to the lowest point of my
career, then all of a sudden to the highest part, that quickly,''
Rafter said of his post-Open aftershock. ``The pressures are what
you create for yourself; it shows how easy you can turn it off.''
</P>
<P>
   With the victory over Bjorkman, Rafter reached a sizable
pressure point, his first Slam semifinal of the season, a semifinal
that could contain Sampras. This year Rafter became the first
Australian since Rod Laver to win five titles in a single year, and
one of them, at Cincinnati, was collected at the expense of
Sampras, who had a weeklong tantrum over the controversial ace
Rafter served at match point.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter said his defeat of Sampras last month worked miracles on
his confidence. ``If I do happen to play him, it does help to know
I've beaten him recently,'' he said. ``I won't go onto the court
feeling as intimidated as I had before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still going to be intimidated, he's just that sort of
player,'' Rafter said of the four-time champion who can tie Roy
Emerson's Slam record by winning a 12th Slam crown here. ``But it
will be nothing like what I felt before; I learned that if I'm
playing well, I can compete with all the guys.''
</P>
<P>
   But confidence isn't all it takes. In his first match here since
he won the title, Rafter very nearly became the first defending
champion in the Open's history to find himself dethroned in the
first round. He was down two-sets-to-none to Hicham Arazi and
making plans to spend this Friday partying down with Pearl Jam at
Madison Square Garden instead of duking it out in the semifinals
before his Slam survival instincts kicked in.
</P>
<P>
   The comeback improved Rafter's five-set record to 10-2. It also
was the fourth time he had rescued himself from the dire straits of
a two-sets-to-none deficit, and marked his ninth straight victory
when forced to go the distance.
</P>
<P>
   Since that treacherous start, Rafter has been in charge here.
``If I happen to win this tournament, that puts me in a very good
position to become the No. 1 player in the world further on this
year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport, who was unaware of it, could claim the No. 1 ranking
simply by doing what Rafter did a year ago: make a Grand Slam
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't lie awake at night and see myself winning a Grand
Slam, ever, but if it happens, that's great,'' said Davenport, who
reached the semifinals Wednesday with a 6-0, 6-4 throttling of
13th-seeded Amanda Coetzer.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to get to the final and try to win it,'' Davenport
said.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Walt Disney Co., continuing its strategy of
aggressive expansion of key brands, has announced a partnership
with Sears, Roebuck and Co. to open 450 ESPN shops within Sears
department stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal is just another way for Disney to realize value from
the ESPN brand now that ESPN is basically synonymous with sports,''
said Linda Bannister, an analyst at Edward Jones, of Wednesday's
announcement. ``I don't think they're in danger of overexposure
because the nation's attention towards sports has really been
increasing recently.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney opened its first and only ESPN store a year ago at the
Glendale (Calif.) Galleria. The 4,000-square-foot outlet is replete
with TV monitors, team apparel and memorabilia, and interactive
kiosks. It plans to open two more ESPN outlets in Southern
California later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal with Sears, the first 100 shops will open next
month in spaces ranging between 200 and 500 square feet with
ESPN-brand clothes and accessories and the sports channel's
programming. Another 350 shops are expected to open by April.
</P>
<P>
   The Sears pact indicates Disney, bases in Burbank, Calif., sees
significant growth possibilities from marketing the ESPN brand. The
Glendale ESPN store has been performing ``very well,'' said
spokesman John Singh.
</P>
<P>
   Disney opened the first ESPN restaurant earlier this year in
Baltimore and currently operates more than 650 Disney Stores
worldwide as part of its efforts to cross-market its characters,
theme parks and films. It owns 80 percent of ESPN through its $19
billion buyout of Capital Cities/ABC Inc., while the Hearst Corp.
holds the remaining 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The ESPN cable network is also facing ongoing competition from
Fox Sports Net, saidsports consultant David Carter, as part of a
larger battle between Disney and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. ``It's
important for ESPN to keep getting its identity out there,'' he
said. &QL;

AMGEN TESTING BONE DRUG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Biotechnology drug maker Amgen announced Wednesday
that a drug designed to fight osteoporosis, a condition common in
the elderly in which bones easily break, is being tested on humans.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, osteoprotegrin or OPG, a genetically engineered
version of a naturally occurring human protein, appears to regulate
bone mass, according to Amgen.
</P>
<P>
   In the initial trial phase, Amgen researchers will evaluate
whether OPG is safe for use by healthy, post-menopausal women. Four
times as many women as men develop osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   If that test is successful, later trial phases will study
whether OPG plays a role in maintaining bone mass and whether that
in turn leads to fewer osteoporosis-related ailments, like broken
bones.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts project the potential market for a successful
osteoporosis drug could reach as high as $1 billion a year in the
United States, though they caution that profits for Thousand Oaks,
Calif.-based Amgen _ the world's largest biotech concern _ from OPG
remain years away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Osteoporosis is a big, big market,'' said analyst Catherine
Copithorne at Prudential Securities. But because osteoporosis is a
condition that develops over a number of years, ``the drawback is
that the clinical trial schedules tend to be very long,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Copithorne said it could be up to five years before Amgen
completes all the trials needed for U.S. Food and Drug
Administration approval of OPG.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen shares closed down $1.3125 on Wednesday at $68.4375. &QL;

STARR'S REPORT DELIVERED IN DRAMATIC TRANSFER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rarely does the nation see such a visible shift of
power.
</P>
<P>
   But there, Wednesday afternoon, in front of the marble steps
leading to the House of Representatives, Capitol police transferred
Kenneth Starr's report on President Clinton from vans of the
special counsel to those belonging to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, the taped, white file boxes were shifted _ and
Clinton's fate may have moved along with them.
</P>
<P>
   A few legislators gathered with tourists, reporters and
congressional aides _ separated from the dramatic scene by a cordon
of police officers, some patrolling on bicycles.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's decision to turn his vast conclusions and files over to
the House had come so quickly that some people on the East Front of
the Capitol were not certain what they were witnessing.
</P>
<P>
   The two copies of the report, each buttressed by 18 boxes of
additional materials, represented Starr's eight months of inquiry
into Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The materials were turned over to House Sergeant at Arms Wilson
Livingood. He ordered the van-to-van transfer and their
quarter-mile trip to the nearby Ford House Annex for safe-keeping.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich said the reports and files will
remain locked up until at least Friday. The House is scheduled to
vote then on authorizing the Judiciary Committee to lead an inquiry
into possible impeachment proceedings against the president. The
resolution also will set the rules for how the documents will be
handled, including their release to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us will have access to (the report) until we pass a
resolution about how to deal with this,'' said Gingrich, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Partisan affiliation shaded members' views of the public
transfer of the documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think much about it,'' said Rep. Eddie Bernice
Johnson, D-Dallas, when told that Starr had finally submitted his
long-awaited report.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does seem to like the attention, doesn't he,'' Johnson said
of Starr, contending that the independent counsel could have
delivered the report in a less public manner.
</P>
<P>
   As she spoke, TV cameramen screamed at people to get out of
their line of sight so that they could continue filming the
transfer of the boxes.
</P>
<P>
   The vans pulled up in front of the Capitol about 4 p.m. EDT,
just as Republican leaders were ending an outdoor news conference
nearby, outlining their legislative agenda for the fall session.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said Starr did not ``call ahead'' to say the report was
coming, despite an appeal from Republican and Democratic lawmakers
that he give them some idea when to expect it.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich and House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt met late
Wednesday night to try to figure out, as one Republican aide put
it, ``what we're supposed to do now.''
</P>
<P>
   The public delivery of the Starr documents was unprecedented
because Congress has no procedures in place for handling a special
prosecutor's report on possible impeachable offenses committed by a
president. The Watergate investigations and hearings, for example,
were conducted by a joint committee of the House and Senate before
Congress passed legislation establishing an independent counsel
statute.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all new territory for us,'' said one Democratic
leadership aide. ``We're having to kind of make it up as we go
along.''

MANY INVESTORS INTEND TO RIDE OUT DOW
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Resilient. That's the attitude of investors in
today's volatile market.
</P>
<P>
   Take Dana Fuhr, a resident of the Los Angeles suburb of Woodland
Hills. The 37-year-old office manager is holding onto her
portfolio, packed with utilities and communications stocks, instead
of panicking and selling in a downturn.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the stocks I have right now are for the long term,'' she
said Wednesday. ``I want to keep these.''
</P>
<P>
   A daily poll conducted by America Online shows that many people
agree with her, even as the stock market continues to gyrate. After
soaring 380.53 points Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average
sank 155.76 on Wednesday to 7,865.02 as Dow components Merrill
Lynch and Procter &AMP; Gamble issued disappointing business updates
and analysts issued bearish outlooks for The Walt Disney Co. and
Sears, Roebuck and Co.
</P>
<P>
   Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 lost 17.26 points to 1,006.20 and the
Nasdaq Composite Index gave up 36.31 to close at 1,624.55.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the turbulence, the online poll of more than 110,000
investors shows that 61.3 percent are holding their portfolios
steady compared with 25.5 percent who are buying and 13.2 percent
who are selling.
</P>
<P>
   Four out of 10 believe the market will go up 5 percent to 10
percent in the next three months, while 19 percent believe it will
shoot up 10 percent or more. Another 19 percent think the market
will maintain its current level. Only 22 percent expect the stock
market to fall at least 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-five percent believe that stocks are the best investment
at this time, compared with 13 percent who favor bonds and 22
percent recommend cash or a money market account. Additionally, 60
percent of investors are not planning to cut back on their
purchases because of the market drop. Twenty-seven percent plan to
whittle down their expenses and 13 percent weren't sure.
</P>
<P>
   As for what investors did after the October 1987 crash, 56
percent held onto their investments while 25 percent bought and 11
percent sold. About 8 percent of those polled were not investors 11
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Reid, a certified financial planner at the American Express
Financial Advisors office in Glendale, observed the same behavior
among her clients.
</P>
<P>
   Most aren't selling, which has been Reid's advice, and some are
cautiously buying. The few who are selling are mostly people close
to retirement who want to move into more conservative investments,
such as bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emotionally, it may seem that the best way (is to sell), but
practically and financially speaking, it is not a good decision to
sell when the market's down,'' she said. ``It's normal for the
market to be volatile. ... Historically, the market always goes up.
If your goals are long term and you've got a good asset allocation,
you should stay with it.'' &QL;

CUDDLE UP TO THE NEW SWEATER GIRL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; The sweater girl is back in town.
</P>
<P>
   She's as casually chic as she was in 1920, when Coco Chanel
created her famous twinsets with pearls, and Elsa Schiaparelli
knitted pullovers with trompe l'oeil effects.
</P>
<P>
   And she's just as provocative as she was in the '40s, when stars
like Lana Turner and Marilyn Monroe wore their sweaters a tad too
small.
</P>
<P>
   Lost in decades of power suits, baggy clothes and ultra-spare
styles, the mystique of the sweater girl has been rediscovered by a
new generation of designers and the women they dress, says Dale
Gluckman, curator of costumes and textiles at the Los Angeles
County Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   According to Gluckman, ``Sweaters are part of our fascination
we're having with the '40s, and I think they're a hit again because
people like the ease and neatness about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Modern sweater girl Catherine Bell, the star of the hit CBS
drama series ``JAG,'' thinks sweaters have made a comeback in
fashion because of boredom with recent trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion is cyclical, so it's no surprise. Besides, after
wearing all those low-cut dresses, it's nice to cover up in a
sweater.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Sherman Oaks actress tried on some of the season's newest
knits, she said she went through a period in her life when she
thought she had to dress more authoritatively, much like her Marine
Corps attorney character Sarah MacKenzie. ``Unlike her, I've gotten
over that and find sweaters very feminine, especially cashmere
twinsets ... but I wouldn't wear pearls,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Posing in a variety of styles, including a crocheted camisole
under a matching cardigan, a zip-front cashmere sweater with a hood
trimmed in mink, and a '50s-style cardigan with beading and
embroidery, it's clear that Bell has done this before. ``Yes, I was
a part-time model while I was studying pre-med at UCLA,'' she
admits, ``but once I got an acting job, I changed my mind about
being a doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for her role on ``JAG,'' Bell says she stayed a week
at Camp Pendleton and participated in what she calls a mini-boot
camp. She came out with a lot of respect for the military but says
she'd never consider signing up. ``It's so disciplined and
demanding, and then there's the uniform. Marine green is so hard to
wear ...''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike real Marines, Bell's character has her uniforms carefully
tailored to show her, ah, best features. And when the show's fourth
season kicks off Sept. 22., you may see even more of her, hints
Bell.
</P>
<P>
   For those who didn't realize ``JAG'' or Bell had been on the air
that long, the actress explains that she was not in the original
series but came in as a replacement during the second season. Then
the show changed writers, networks and time slot, moving to 8 p.m.
Tuesdays.
</P>
<P>
   For would-be sweater girls, the twinset is a must-have, but
there's other news.
</P>
<P>
   According to William Sung, president of the L.A.-based Bette
Paige knitwear company that's been nominated for the California
Rising Star award, ``New technologies such as computerized designs
and futuristic fabrics have played a significant part in the
sweater's newfound popularity ... and lighter-weight knits also
have helped the sweater establish a firm footing as a year-round
wardrobe staple.''
</P>
<P>
   Television stylist Jane Mannfolk translates that manufacturing
news into what she calls a new body consciousness. ``With the
addition of Lycra, sweaters not only keep their shape better, but
they cling to curves and enhance your figure,'' says Mannfolk.
</P>
<P>
   But Bell knows the real reason sweaters are in again. ``Guys
love them,'' she quips.

FERRARO'S DAYS IN CONGRESS: REVIEWS ARE MIXED
</HEADLINE>
  (See also NY-POLITICAL ADS, NY-DAMATO-CAMPAIGN-FINANCE)  
(nk) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ From the moment Geraldine Ferraro entered the New
York race for Senate, her opponents have questioned her skills and
experience, suggesting that she was little more than a fading
celebrity in search of an office.
</P>
<P>
   At almost every turn, Ferraro has responded by pointing to her
six-year tenure in the House of Representatives, saying it offers a
resume of accomplishments that her rivals should envy and a
blueprint to understanding her rise from political neophyte to the
first woman to be a major party candidate for vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inside of two years, I was elected to House leadership, and
within five years, to the national platform committee,'' she said
in a recent interview, echoing a line from television commercials
she began running two weeks ago. ``That is the experience that will
allow me to produce when I'm in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Former colleagues and House officials generally agreed that
Ferraro was often an effective congresswoman. But many said she was
not necessarily an exceptional one, and a look at her time in the
House, from 1979 through 1984, shows that her political climb was
not quite the simple, triumphant tale her campaign would suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro, former colleagues said, could be outspoken on issues
dear to her, like supporting abortion rights, but did not brim with
policy ideas, was not a frequent debater and was not known for
having a detailed grasp of complex bills. She scored some important
legislative victories, they said, but the list was not long.
</P>
<P>
   And while her ascension within the House Democrats'
male-dominated leadership was unquestionably swift and clearly
abetted by her energy and ambition, she also benefited heavily from
her party's political needs at the time.
</P>
<P>
   For in the early 1980s, Democrats were searching for female
leaders to help broaden the ``gender gap'' separating the parties
as well as for centrist politicians who could appeal to the white,
ethnic voters who were abandoning their party in droves for Ronald
Reagan. Ferraro fit both bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Placing her in leadership sent a signal to Reagan Democrats
that here was a Democrat in good standing from a district carried
by Reagan who was standing alongside the Democratic leadership,''
said Ross Baker, a professor of political science at Rutgers
University who was a consultant to the House Democratic caucus in
the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Her supporters say Ferraro rose in leadership not just because
of her sex but because she was willing to fight doggedly on issues
that were important to many women and families, like protecting
abortion rights, reducing poverty and improving the workplace for
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was aggressive,'' said Patricia Schroeder, a former
Democratic congresswoman who served with Ferraro. ``She worked on
flex time, job sharing, all of those things that really weren't in
the vocabulary then.''
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to know what would have happened to Ferraro if
she had not run for vice president in 1984 and had stayed in
Congress, gaining experience and seniority. Some political analysts
say she showed promise and could have risen into the upper echelons
of either house had she not left.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had an instinctive feel for the legislative process,''
said Norman Ornstein, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute
who has known Ferraro since 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Since leaving the House and running for vice president in 1984,
Ferraro has been a television commentator, a lawyer in private
practice, a candidate for Senate in 1992 and the Clinton
administration's representative to the U.N. Human Rights
Commission. While she cites her U.N. experience as equipping her to
deal with foreign affairs, Ferraro and others point to her House
years as providing the clearest evidence of her ability to be a
senator.
</P>
<P>
   Many politicians say Ferraro's real legacy was not legislation
but politics. She was a skillful infighter, a pragmatist who could
win friends among liberal House leaders while not alienating her
conservative Queens constituents, a feisty partisan in attacking
Republicans. To her critics, her triumph was one of style and
politics over substance and policy.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro bristles at such characterizations. She acknowledged
focusing much time on political work for the House leadership and
the Democratic Party but said that should not make her less
qualified as a legislator than her major Democratic opponents, Mark
Green and Rep. Charles Schumer, who are known for having voracious
appetites for policy arcana.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you separate policy and politics?'' she asked in the
interview. ``You don't if you want to get legislation passed. I'm
the only one who will be able to do that. I've proven that in the
House.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said that Green, New York City's Public Advocate, has
no right to attack her legislative record when he has none of his
own and that Schumer has taken credit for bills other people wrote.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A review of Ferraro's six years in Congress shows that she was
not the most active of bill writers herself. She was chief sponsor
of just six bills in her first term, and about 40 over three terms
_ fewer than many members of Congress introduce in a single term.
In his first six years, Schumer, who entered Congress in 1980,
sponsored about 80 bills.
</P>
<P>
   Though Democrats controlled Congress during her first term and
the House for all three of her terms, only two of the measures she
sponsored became law. One required the federal government to help
pay local governments for protecting visiting dignitaries and was
introduced at the behest of New York City Mayor Ed Koch.
</P>
<P>
   The other was intended to help widows collect their dead
husbands' pensions. Considered Ferraro's signature bill, the
measure helped prevent husbands from signing away their wives'
rights to survivors' benefits without consulting them. It also
protected the pensions of workers who left their jobs to care for
families.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro was certainly successful at gaining a foothold in the
House leadership. From almost the day she reached Washington,
Ferraro was close to House Speaker Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill Jr., the
gruff-talking Democrat from Massachusetts who made her his protegee
and promoted her into several party positions. Ferraro, whose
father died when she was 8, has described O'Neill as a father
figure.
</P>
<P>
   With O'Neill's help, Ferraro became secretary to the Democratic
House Caucus in 1980 and a member of a commission that rewrote the
party's rules for nominating presidential candidates in 1981. In
1984, she became the first woman to head the Democrats' national
platform committee. And O'Neill played a pivotal role in urging
Walter Mondale to pick her as his running mate that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the Good Housekeeping seal of approval for my work,''
Ferraro said of O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   Among Democrats, Ferraro won plaudits for her work on the
platform committee by negotiating a consensus among the party's
combative factions on issues from abortion to affirmative action to
Persian Gulf policy.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to House Democratic leaders at that time said in recent
interviews that Ferraro came into the House at a time when O'Neill
was searching for a woman to join the leadership. She immediately
hit it off with him, they said.
</P>
<P>
   She also voted consistently with the House leadership, often
against the prevailing attitudes of her relatively conservative
district. Though her district voted for President Reagan in 1980
and 1984, she opposed Reagan's tax cuts, budgets and defense
spending plans while voting to increase social-services spending.
She did, however, break with other Democrats to oppose forced
busing to desegregate schools and to support tax credits for
parents with children in parochial schools.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Ferraro's critics contend that her focus on leadership
politics came at the expense of concentrating on issues. ``She
craved celebrity recognition,'' said Rep. Gerald Solomon, a
Republican who also entered the House in 1979. ``From the first day
she was there, she had her eye on something higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro said Solomon's comments were ``silly.'' But she
acknowledged that she started seeking party positions and
campaigning for colleagues in 1982 and 1983 specifically to gain
broader national recognition in preparation for running for the
Senate in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was I looking for the next office?'' she asked in the
interview. ``Yes.'' Had she not run for vice president, she added,
``I don't think I would have had a long-term career in the House.''

UCLA'S FOSTER ANXIOUS TO RUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DeShaun Foster does not know what music he'll listen to before
the game. He does not know when he'll play, or how long, or how
many carries he'll get. But he knows this: the first time he lines
up in the UCLA backfield Saturday afternoon against Texas, the
nerves will be raging.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nervous before our first scrimmage, and I was nervous
out here the other day catching punts,'' said Foster, the Bruins'
highly touted freshman tailback. ``But once I get that first carry
over, I'll be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   He was nervous on his first carry for Tustin High School, as a
sophomore in 1995, and gained 5 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take 5 yards on my first carry Saturday,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Foster is the third-string tailback, behind Jermaine Lewis and
Keith Brown. His appearances Saturday _ and perhaps next week
against Houston, as well _ will be predetermined. The Bruins don't
want to jeopardize his confidence, or UCLA's success, by using him
in difficult situations.
</P>
<P>
   But coach Bob Toledo was clear on one matter: ``We'll put
DeShaun in early.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Foster relaxes, he'll probably feel right at home: Texas
was his second choice during the recruiting process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was close to committing right after my trip,'' he said. ``I
really liked Austin, but there weren't too many guys from
California.''
</P>
<P>
   Get out of the kitchen: Toledo repeatedly has warned the Bruins
to expect sweltering heat in Pasadena. (Kickoff is 12:30 p.m.) To
acclimatize the players, he scheduled several mid-day practices
during the late-August heat wave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the linemen lose 15 pounds in one practice,'' Toledo
said. ``You can't simulate that kind of heat. The same thing
happened (last season) against Tennessee. That's why we aren't
going to play just 11 guys on offense and 11 on defense. We'll play
17 or 18.''
</P>
<P>
   Review of the week: All-American offensive tackle Kris Farris is
a movie buff who wants to direct when his playing career ends. He
has agreed to review a movie each week for the Daily News. This
week's selection is: ``Your Friends and Neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an adult black comedy about three couples who discuss sex
and relationships in an explicit manner,'' he said. ``They have
realistic views of relationships, but they don't get past the sex,
which makes it an incomplete story.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a movie for young adults. But it's not a good date movie,
and it's not a good movie to see with your parents, which I did.
It's a friend or buddy movie. I give it !tvspt2!2{ pancakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ticket update: Fewer than 4,000 tickets remain for Saturday's
game. For more info, call (310) UCLA-WIN.
</P>
<P>
   Those attending should get there early. With 80,000 fans
expected in the congested Arroyo, anyone who arrives 30 minutes
before kickoff is in danger of missing the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, he has a problem: Talented freshman cornerback Lovell
Houston (strained quadricep muscle) expects to practice next week
for the first time since training camp began. Whether he plays this
season is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to go through the season with a nagging injury,''
he said. ``I'm just going to put it in the coaches' hands. If they
think I can make a significant impact, I'm sure they'll play me.''

VAN RAAPHORST IGNORES QB CONTROVERSY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   USC quarterback Mike Van Raaphorst has not lost his starting
position to freshman Carson Palmer, but it's clear he felt a little
stung by some of the public reaction to his opening-game effort
against Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I missed some passes,'' Van Raaphorst said. ``But I don't
think it's time to take me to the guillotine.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Palmer's sudden emergence during the Trojans' 27-17
victory over Purdue, Van Raaphorst said he hasn't worried about the
possibility a quarterback controversy will develop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people just like to have something going on,'' he
said. ``It doesn't bother me.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Paul Hackett said he might play Palmer in the first half
against San Diego State, although he reiterated that Van Raaphorst
is the starter and will receive more snaps in practice this week.
</P>
<P>
   Defense depleted: Two starters _ linebacker Mark Cusano and
strong safety Grant Pearsall _ will miss the San Diego State game
because of injuries. Cusano injured his ankle last week in practice
while Pearsall's recovery from strained knee ligaments remains
slow.
</P>
<P>
   Zeke Moreno will start at linebacker for Cusano while Ife
Ohalete will fill in for Pearsall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark has had a frustrating camp,'' Hackett said. ``I thought
he played pretty well in the game. But I think he needs to get well
for him to have the year he wants and the year we expect him to
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Lawrence Larry's playing time will also be
limited, after he re-injured his tender ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably won't (start),'' Hackett said. ``He tweaked it
again today.''
</P>
<P>
   Center Eric Denmon returned Wednesday, after spending a few days
in Texas to visit his ill grandfather. Hackett said Denmon and Matt
McShane would split time at the position.
</P>
<P>
   Reunion time: Moreno, who is from Chula Vista, will have about
35 friends, family members and former coaches attend the San Diego
State game. Included in that group will be his mother, who made an
impression by sneaking a sign with her son's name into the Coliseum
for the Purdue game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told her she couldn't bring it in, but she did anyway and
I saw it during the game,'' Moreno said. ``It was pretty cool.''

LEO PENN, 77, STAGE ACTOR AND TV DIRECTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (bl)  
 By KATHRYN SHATTUCK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leo Penn, an actor whose decade on the Hollywood blacklist in
the 1940s and '50s stalled his career and eventually led him to
direct, primarily in television, died Sept. 5 at St. John's Health
Center in Santa Monica, Calif. He was 77 and lived in Malibu.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was lung cancer, said Mara Buxbaum at PMK Public
Relations in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Penn began his acting career at the University of California at
Los Angeles, where he studied drama in hope of teaching. Instead,
after performing in a play on campus, Hollywood beckoned and Penn
responded. After a stint as an officer and bombardier in the Army
Air Corps during World War II, he signed a studio contract with
Paramount in 1945, which they refused to renew when Penn was
blacklisted after supporting the Hollywood 10, a group of
screenwriters, directors and producers who were ultimately
imprisoned for their refusal to answer the House Un-American
Activities Committee's questions concerning communist sympathies.
</P>
<P>
   Penn survived the blacklist by acting in television and in the
theater, landing leading roles in stage productions like ``Maya,''
directed by Sanford Meisner; ``The School for Scandal,'' directed
by Frank Corsaro; ``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,'' directed by Elia
Kazan, and ``The Girl on the Via Flaminia'' and ``The Iceman
Cometh,'' directed by Jose Quintero.
</P>
<P>
   It was on a street corner outside the Circle in the Square
Theater in 1957 that Penn, playing Hickey in ``Iceman,'' the role
originated by Jason Robards, met his wife, actress Eileen Ryan, who
was also a member of the cast. Within a week they had moved in
together; they married in a matter of months. The union lasted 40
years and produced three sons _ the musician Michael and the actors
Sean and Chris.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the couple acted together once again in
``Remembrance,'' Graham Reid's drama about a former British soldier
and a Catholic Irish widow who fall in love in the Belfast cemetery
where each has buried a son. Their son Sean produced the play at
the Odyssey Theater in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Penn's movie career finally recovered when he was offered a role
in Clifford Odets' 1959 film ``Story on Page One.'' Ironically,
Penn had just learned that it was Odets who turned over his name to
the congressional committees responsible for authoring the
blacklist and that guilt may have prompted Odets' call. ``And there
went all my integrity!'' Penn joked in a 1997 profile in The Los
Angeles Times. ``That feature bought us our first house.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in the Hollywood mainstream, however, Penn grew weary of
acting. ``I looked young for my age, and I was tired of being cast
as baby-faced killers,'' he said in the same profile. ``I had
directed one play, off-Broadway, and thought I might like to
direct.''
</P>
<P>
   Through a friend, he was able to maneuver his way onto the set
of ``Ben Casey,'' where he worked his way from jack-of-all trades,
rewriting scenes and doing odd jobs, to directing episodes of the
show. ``I've been a happy gypsy ever since,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Penn directed more than 400 hours of prime-time television,
including episodes of ``Ben Casey,'' ``I Spy,'' ``Police Story,''
``Kojak,'' ``Matlock'' and ``St. Elsewhere.'' His two-hour episode
of ``Columbo,'' ``Any Port in a Storm,'' won an Emmy Award.
</P>
<P>
   He also directed the 1966 film ``A Man Called Adam,'' and the
1988 film ``Judgment in Berlin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Leo was wise,'' said his longtime friend Ernest Frankel, a
retired television producer and writer, of Penn's directorial
abilities. ``He always insisted on making the most pedestrian
material as good as it can be.'' In their book ``The American
Vein,'' Christopher Wicking and Tise Vahimagi agreed: ``It is not
absurd to suggest that Penn is `mainstream' TV at its most
excellent and as such, he has made the ballroom a better place.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife and sons, Penn is survived by three
grandchildren.

 &HT;    Genetic database helps get suspects
 &HT;    By Rebeca Rodriguez
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ For the first time in Texas, law enforcement officials
have used a high-tech DNA database to positively link a person to a
crime where the only evidence available was DNA from the crime
scene, state officials announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A Texas man has been charged with the sexual assaults of two
young North Texas girls in 1993, a case in which he had not been a
suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have a DNA database that proverbially allows us to find
the needle in the haystack,'' said Gov. George W. Bush at a press
conference announcing the event.
</P>
<P>
   The use of the database as an investigative tool could usher in
a whole new era of crime detection and prosecution, officials say.
But the use of DNA _ the distinct genetic blueprint found in human
cells _ as the sole piece of evidence to catch criminals is in its
infancy in Texas, and it may be awhile before it becomes
commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the Legislature passed a law requiring anyone convicted
of or serving time for a sex offense in Texas to submit a blood
sample. The blood samples are sent to the Texas Department of
Public Safety's laboratory in Austin, where DNA information is
analyzed and entered into a database.
</P>
<P>
   When a sex offense is committed, law officers collect evidence
from the crime scene and alert DPS laboratory officials, who
compare the existing DNA information from the blood samples with
crime scene evidence. A so-called cold hit occurs when the DNA of a
person who is not a suspect in a particular crime is matched with
DNA from the scene of that crime.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas database, which has 7,500 DNA profiles and 7,000 blood
samples waiting to be analyzed, is one cog in a national program
called CODIS, or Combined DNA Index System. As of August 1997,
35states had databases. All 50 states have legislation in place to
create them.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state money pays for the program, which costs
approximately $600,000 to $700,000, though that figure could rise
as the database grows.
</P>
<P>
   CODIS, administered through the FBI, can be accessed by law
enforcement officials to search for matches, even in cases where
there are no suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the case with the assaults of the two young girls in
Granbury, 35 miles southwest of Fort Worth. The sisters, ages 10
and 11, were each sexually assaulted in a dry creek bed near their
home while the other was forced to watch, according to Detective
Bruce Espin of the Granbury Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   The only evidence law enforcement officials had to go on was
some semen collected from the victims' clothing. At the time, it
was not enough to charge anyone with the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, Lester Don Parks, 41, of Coleman, has been
charged with two counts of sexual assault with a deadly weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities had taken a sample of Parks' blood after he was
convicted of a 1995 sexual assault. They compared the sample with
DNA evidence from the 1993 Granbury case.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Parks confessed to the assaults after the DNA
evidence was presented to him.
</P>
<P>
   Using the CODIS software, officials across the nation have made
more than 200 cold hits, said Steve Niezgoda, CODIS program manager
for the FBI. As more states get their databases up and running,
that number should climb substantially, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas began compiling its DNA database in January 1996. Virginia
started its database in 1989 and has collected more than 170,000
blood samples. But only about 11,000 samples have been analyzed,
said Dr. Paul Ferrara, director of Virginia's Division of
Forensics, which manages the state's database.
</P>
<P>
   Like Texas, Virginia started out sampling only violent sex
offenders for placement in the database. It has now been expanded
to include all convicted felons and juveniles 14 or older who
commit the equivalent of a felony. Texas officials say the same
could eventually occur here.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, there were more than 8,000 reported rapes in Texas,
according to the DPS crime reporting division.
</P>
<P>
   ``These databanks are revolutionizing criminal investigations,''
Ferrara said. ``Not only do you have the capability of confirming
that a suspect did or did not commit a crime, you have the
resources to run the DNA profiles from crime scenes where the
police don't have suspects.''
</P>
<P>
   A positive DNA match does not seal a suspect's fate, Ferrara
said, but it does help prosecutors during trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like in any DNA case, it becomes strong evidence,'' he said.
``Because it is such powerful evidence, a lot of time is spent
attempting to attack it.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, DNA evidence has been used to clear people of
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Salazar of Garfield, outside Austin, was convicted in 1992
of raping a pregnant Austin woman and was serving a 30-year
sentence when DNA tests exonerated him of the crime last year.
</P>
<P>
   The technology, like any other form of evidence gathering, is
subject to legal challenge, Ferrara said. Virginia's database law
was challenged in 1990, when opponents contended that the taking of
blood samples was a form of illegal search and seizure and violated
a felon's right to privacy.
</P>
<P>
   But Ferrara said the law was upheld and DNA evidence has never
been seriously challenged in a courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never experienced a situation where the accuracy and
the reliability of DNA evidence was in question,'' he said.
``That's one of the beauties of DNA collection and analysis. It's
based in hard science that has been accepted and endorsed by the
scientific community. It's objective and the results are beyond
dispute.''
</P>
<P>
   But even reliable science is prone to human error.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forensic laboratories are only as good as the quality of
evidence that they get. Where humans are involved, nothing is
absolute,'' Ferrara said.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the collection and analyzing of blood samples and
crime-scene evidence go smoothly, the chances of linking the wrong
person to a crime are close to zero, said Dr. Dennis Loockerman,
CODIS lab supervisor with the DPS.
</P>
<P>
   The odds are ``about one in 72 billion,'' Loockerman said.
</P>
<P>
   The lab tests nine different locations on the genetic strand.
For a positive link, those nine areas must match up on crime scene
DNA and blood samples, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Matches will become more routine as databases get larger and are
in place for longer periods of time, Ferrara said. But more
resources and personnel could help get the job done faster, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of backlogs, we've been making hits on crimes that are
a year or 2 or 5 or 8 years old,'' Ferrara said. ``It gives you
pause to think, if we had done testing immediately upon receipt of
samples, how many less victims would there be?''

 &HT;    UT System to offer online degrees
 &HT;    By Mary Ann Roser
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ In a nod to the Internet's increasing influence on
daily life and higher education, the University of Texas System
announced Wednesday that it is preparing to launch its first online
degree programs.
</P>
<P>
   Starting next fall, Texans, regardless of where they live, will
be able to obtain a master's degree in business administration and
a master's of educational technology without leaving home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a whole different way of teaching'' and a way to ``reach
the citizens of this state,'' said Darcy Hardy, director of the UT
TeleCampus, which is launching the programs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Austin's status as a high-tech mecca and its strong MBA
demand, UT-Austin is the only campus among UT's nine academic
institutions that will not offer an MBA degree online.
</P>
<P>
   Robert May, dean of the graduate school of business, was
traveling Wednesday and could not be reached. His assistant deans
declined to comment and referred questions to May.
</P>
<P>
   Monty Jones, a spokesman for the UT System, said he was told the
Austin campus intends to concentrate on expanding its ``executive
format'' MBA programs to serve nontraditional students. Students in
that program attend classes on two Fridays and Saturdays a month,
which means they must be excused from work on the Fridays.
</P>
<P>
   Many working adults, including some who said they would like to
go to UT, are enrolled in evening-school programs at St. Edward's
University and Southwest Texas State University. UT does not have a
traditional night school that enables people to get degrees while
working full time during the day.
</P>
<P>
   However, UT does offer individual evening classes and is
continuing to expand the number of specific courses it offers on
the Internet. Many other colleges across the country are offering
distance-learning classes.
</P>
<P>
   Less common are degree programs that are totally online.
</P>
<P>
   Of schools in the Austin area, SWT will be the first. It will
offer a master's in applied geography, starting in January.
</P>
<P>
   The UT System's other online master's program, in educational
technology, is being offered through UT-Brownsville, which will
deliver the first 12 hours of courses and award the degrees.
UT-Austin and other system campuses are proposing to teach courses
to cover the other 27 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's providing some critically needed learning opportunities
to teachers and professional educators across the state,'' said
Paul Resta, an education professor and director of the Austin
campus's learning-technology center. ``We're having this rapid
infusion of technology into the schools, and a lot of the
medium-sized and small school districts don't have the
technological leadership to help them.''
</P>
<P>
   Brownsville was chosen to award the degrees because it is the
only UT school that has a specific master's program in educational
technology, Hardy said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she were disappointed that UT-Austin has chosen not to
be involved in the MBA program, Hardy said, ``We'd love to have
everyone involved,'' but ``I feel they have legitimate reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   The other schools have ``excellent programs,'' and while the
degree ``won't have UT-Austin's name on it, it will have the UT
System's,'' Hardy said.
</P>
<P>
   For more information about the online programs, call Hardy's
office at 499-4207 in Austin or toll-free at (888) TEXAS-16.

19 LAPD OFFICERS RECEIVE MEDAL OF VALOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY PATRICK McGREEVY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Calling them the ``bravest of the brave,'' Police
Chief Bernard C. Parks bestowed the Medal of Valor on 19 LAPD
officers, including 17 officers who were part of the 1997 North
Hollywood bank shootout.
</P>
<P>
   In awarding the department's highest honor to the most officers
involved in a single incident, Parks and Mayor Richard Riordan said
during Wednesday's ceremony last year's gunbattle with two heavily
armed bank robbers in the L.A. suburb of North Hollywood showed the
world a model of courage under fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The North Hollywood shootout showed graphically to all
Angelenos that our police officers are putting their lives on the
line every day,'' said Riordan.
</P>
<P>
   Two robbery suspects in full body armor fired more than 1,200
rounds of ammunition during the 44-minute, internationally
televised gun battle, which left 10 Los Angeles Police Department
officers and four civilians wounded and the two suspects dead.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Parks bestowed the Medal of Valor on Detectives
Larry Winston and Phillip Wixon, members of the LAPD's elite and
controversial Special Investigation Section, who were seriously
wounded in a gun battle with robbers outside a liquor store in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsored by the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, the
ceremony was attended by more than 1,000 business and civic
leaders, police officers and their families at the Westin
Bonaventure Hotel in downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Parks said the 19 officers represent what's best about the LAPD.
</P>
<P>
   ``These individuals clearly have shown, without any regard for
their own personal safety, the ability to move forward and protect
the citizens of Los Angeles,'' said Parks.
</P>
<P>
   Those who received the medals said they felt honored.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's overwhelming,'' said Wixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very humbling. I'm very proud,'' said Foothill Division
Sgt. Israel Sonny Medina, who received the Medal of Valor for
distracting one of the North Hollywood robbers and drawing his fire
so that Special Weapons and Tactics officers could move into
position. Medina, a 17-year LAPD veteran, called the shootout ``the
worst deadly situation I've seen'' but said many more of the nearly
100 LAPD officers who were involved also deserve the award.
</P>
<P>
   Detective Tracey Angeles agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The medal I'm receiving today I accept on behalf of all of the
officers who were there, who I think deserve it,'' said Angeles,
who was shot during the gun battle.
</P>
<P>
   The North Hollywood detective said her greatest emotion during
the incident was fear, but she was amazed at how another wounded
officer she helped rescue also provided support for her as they
came under heavy gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   SWAT Officer Richard Massa, who engaged in a close-quarter gun
battle with a robbery suspect who had an automatic weapon, said he
was getting the medal for simply doing his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we are trained for, to put our lives on the
line,'' Massa said. ``We didn't have a chance to think of the
danger. We were in a gun battle 30 feet away from a man with an
assault rifle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing I've ever been involved with was that intense,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Others who received the Medal of Valor on Wednesday included:

CHINESE MAN'S RELEASE ENDS A 5-YEAR TALE OF MISFORTUNE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELIZABETH, N.J. _ In a reversal of fortune worthy of a Chinese
poem about faith and perseverance, a Chinese man who had tried
twice in the last five years to sneak into the United States walked
out of an immigration jail a free man Wednesday after being cleared
by officials to remain in this country indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   The release of Wang Wu Dong culminates a roller-coaster
existence for a man whose attempts to abandon a life as a farmer in
southern China for a chance at an uncertain existence in the United
States cast a raw light on the flourishing, and perilous, criminal
enterprise of smuggling people from China.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Wang was a passenger on the Golden Venture, a freighter
crammed with 286 illegal Chinese immigrants that ran aground in
Queens. Wang was caught but failed to win asylum, and was deported
only months before Congress passed a law in 1996 that would have
improved his chances for asylum.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Wang was aboard the Oops II, a powerboat that carried 23
illegal Chinese immigrants and landed in a dense fog in an affluent
town on the New Jersey shore. At first, the Immigration and
Naturalization Service suggested that Wang, now in his mid-40s, was
likely to be deported again under a 1996 law that allows for the
deportation of any illegal immigrant who had previously been
deported.
</P>
<P>
   But a few weeks ago, a federal judge in Newark granted Wang
``withholding'' status, a rarely invoked designation that allows
illegal immigrants to live and work in the United States
indefinitely without ever having an opportunity to become a
full-fledged resident.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday afternoon, after immigration officials completed the
paperwork, Wang was released from the custody of the federal
government _ for good. ``I am very happy to be released,'' said a
laconic Wang, who looked tired and gaunt, with bloodshot eyes. He
declined to say much else, only that he planned to stay, for now,
with his sister in Delaware. ``I miss my sister,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Wang's release coincides with the end of an important phase of
the federal government's investigation into what officials
described as an international smuggling operation that demanded as
much as $40,000 from anyone interested in leaving Fujian Province
for the United States, via South America.
</P>
<P>
   After the 23 illegal immigrants from the Oops II were seized in
Bay Head, N.J., on May 30, they were held at the Elizabeth
Detention Center. And in July, two immigration judges released the
23 on bond, pending asylum and deportation hearings.
</P>
<P>
   But the 23 were immediately rearrested by federal authorities as
witnesses in the federal investigation, which has resulted in
several indictments so far.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, federal prosecutors took depositions from some of the
23 and returned the men to the INS so they could be released on
bond. In addition to Wang, four illegal immigrants have been
released so far, while the others are expected to be released by
the end of this week, according to immigration officials.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Wang's case has attracted the most attention because of his
repeat trips.
</P>
<P>
   The first time, Wang spent three years in an immigration jail in
York, Pa., claiming that his wife had been sterilized for violating
China's one-child policy. But he became increasingly disillusioned
and asked to be sent back to China just before a new law was passed
that stipulated that opposition to the one-child policy was a
potential reason for asylum.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Wang got the benefit of the doubt, with a withholding
status that confers limited freedom. He can work and live anywhere
and does not have to report to immigration officials. But he cannot
sponsor any family members as immigrants, cannot become a permanent
resident and cannot leave the United States _ even for a vacation _
without forfeiting his right to remain here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's legal, but it doesn't give him a whole lot of benefits,''
said Amy Otten, a spokeswoman for the Eastern regional office of
the INS in St. Albans, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Wang needed the assistance of immigration lawyers and
visitors to call his relatives in Delaware and his lawyer in New
York. He said he had lost weight and that his few possessions _ his
identification, his wallet, his watch _ were still being held by
federal marshals.
</P>
<P>
   But at 7 p.m., a livery driver named Cui arrived, carrying a
sign that read ``Wang Wu Dong'' in Chinese. Cui asked if Wang was
ready to leave, and Wang, sighing and smiling, nodded yes.

PLUMMER-STAGE (Los Angeles) _ The voice purrs like a Mercedes-Benz
engine. Then comes a friendly chuckle, as if there were something
mildly ridiculous about this whole business of celebrity. Well,
it's not surprising that Christopher Plummer, now in the autumn of
a highly accomplished stage, film and TV career, would understand
the flipside of fame. Byb Reed Johnson. 
. 
CAPTIVITY-TV (Los Angeles) _ If you are an animal, the fictional
planned community of Woodland Heights, Calif. is not the place to
be. In three early episodes of ``Living in Captivity'' rodents die
in traps, a cat gets hit by a car, a lap dog is eaten by a
predator, and a seeing-eye dog is shot by an overzealous vigilante.

SWEATERS-FASHIONS (Los Angeles) _ The sweater girl is back in town.
She's as casually chic as she was in 1920, when Coco Chanel created
her famous twinsets with pearls, and Elsa Schiaparelli knitted
pullovers with trompe l'oeil effects. And she's just as provocative

their sweaters a tad too small. With two sidebars. By Barbara De

ISLANDERS WANT NEW ARENA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ Nassau Coliseum, home to the New York
Islanders, is the oldest unrenovated arena in the National Hockey
League _ and it shows. The ceiling hangs so low that some fans
cannot see the ice, and many seats are broken. The Islanders say
that the Coliseum, built in 1972, is one reason the team is near
the bottom of the NHL in attendance and is losing more than $11
million a year.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit filed in federal court Wednesday, the Islanders
claim that the conditions are so unsafe that the team can no longer
play hockey in the arena. The suit asks the court to declare that
the Islanders have no further obligation under the Coliseum lease
and seeks $10 million in punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a brand-new arena,'' said David Seldin, president of
New York Sports Ventures, which bought the struggling team in
February for $195 million. ``To survive, we've got to attract more
fans, and that means not only better players, but a
state-of-the-art facility.''
</P>
<P>
   The alternative, Seldin said, is to leave town.
</P>
<P>
   It seems as if nearly everyone on Long Island wants a new
coliseum, which could cost more than $200 million. Boosters include
Matthew Crosson, president of the Long Island Association, and the
fans. Thomas Gulotta, the county executive, envisions a new
coliseum as part of an ambitious redevelopment of the 70-acre site
that would include a convention and exhibition center, a hotel and
a public transit system.
</P>
<P>
   But no one can seem to agree on a formula to pay for a new
coliseum _ whether the money should be public, private or both.
</P>
<P>
   The co-owners of the Islanders, Howard Milstein and Steven
Gluckstern, note that the public financed 43 percent of the Buffalo
Sabres' new $127 million arena, 60 percent of the $150 million
Tampa Bay Lightning arena and 100 percent of the Nashville
Predators' arena. Taxpayers, Milstein and Gluckstern said, should
do their part for the Islanders, too.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent public statement, Crosson concurred: ``Public funds
have been used to build Rich Stadium in Buffalo, Knickerbocker
Arena in Albany and minor-league baseball parks in Binghamton,
Rochester and Syracuse,'' he said. ``Why not on Long Island?'' He
noted that Long Island's population was larger than that of many
states and cities and that its economy rivaled those of many
countries.
</P>
<P>
   But in a county that has had a series of tax cuts over the last
several years, both Republicans and Democrats have been carefully
sidestepping the issue of using public funds for a new coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   The Nassau Coliseum is not the only sporting arena in the area
that has been found wanting. The new owners of the New Jersey Nets
are looking to leave the Meadowlands Sports Complex to a proposed
site in Newark. The Devils are also unhappy in the Meadowlands, but
their owner wants to move to Hoboken.
</P>
<P>
   Those plans are still in the talking stage. The possibility of a
new Yankee Stadium in Manhattan has moved to the suing stage: Two
weeks ago the New York City Council speaker, Peter Vallone, charged
in a lawsuit that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani had created a charter
review commission solely to keep a referendum off the ballot in
November that would have asked the voters what they think of paying
for a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner III, principal owner of the Yankees, said at
the end of July that he would help pay for a new stadium, but did
not say how much he would be willing to contribute.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets unveiled plans for a new domed stadium in April, and
they hope to have the city pick up three-quarters of its $500
million price tag. The Mets' owners have also discussed the
possibility of expanding the stadium to 80,000 seats to tempt a pro
football team back to the city. (The Jets' lease at Giants Stadium
in New Jersey expires in 2008.)

<P>
   And the U.S. Open is being played at the one-year-old National
Tennis Center, which cost $254 million to build. The city helped
out by issuing $150 million in tax-exempt bonds to build the
center, but the U.S. Tennis Association makes the payments.
</P>
<P>
   Gulotta, who would love to cut the ribbon at the opening of a
new Nassau Coliseum, has delegated the nettlesome issue of
financing to Morton Certilman, chairman of the Nassau County
Privatization Committee. As Gulotta's chief negotiator, Certilman
is trying to work out a deal involving the county, New York Sports
Ventures and Spectacor Management Group, which has a contract with
the county to operate the coliseum until 2015.
</P>
<P>
   Gulotta said that the state government had approved $30 million
for the project and that other nontaxpayer money was available
through industrial development agencies like Empire State
Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, it's my own position that most of the funding should
come from the private sector,'' Gulotta said. ``I believe it's the
profit motive that flows from private sector dollars that will
ultimately drive the engine of success for a project of this
type.''
</P>
<P>
   If Gulotta has his way, the new coliseum will be a sports
complex able to house other national sports franchises, like a
basketball team, in addition to the Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a plan for just brick and mortar, but about
creating a destination point and a kind of atmosphere for the
central core of Nassau County,'' Gulotta said.
</P>
<P>
   Gluckstern, however, has a different view. ``I really could do
without all the rest of it,'' he said. ``All I want is a new
coliseum.'' He said he could afford to continue to lose $11 million
dollars on the Islanders for only two more years. ``After that,
we'll have to go elsewhere,'' he said. ``Time is running out.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Islanders needed to start construction of the arena,
which would take two years to build, no later than next summer so
that it could be ready for the 2001-02 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not only playing in the oldest facility in the NHL, but
we have the worst lease deal in the NHL,'' Gluckstern said in a
recent interview at the coliseum. He said that while the Islanders
was a ``fabulous brand in a large, affluent target market,'' it
suffered from ``a severe decline in product quality and an
underinvestment in the infrastructure of the business, not only on
the ice, but in the arena.''
</P>
<P>
   He put much of the blame on Spectacor Management Group and the
county's reluctance to insure that the company followed through on
repairs and upkeep of the arena.
</P>
<P>
   An official close to the negotiations, speaking on the condition
of anonymity, warned, ``If this intramural dispute and legal
wrangling continues, and no plans are drafted soon for a new arena,
you can count on there being empty ice three years from now, if not
sooner.''
