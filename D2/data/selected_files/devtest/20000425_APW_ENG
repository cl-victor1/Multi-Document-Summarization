Boy Brain Dead After Zoo Shooting
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A boy was left brain dead and five other children were
wounded after a feud between two youths at the National zoo ended in a hail of
gunfire Monday evening. The victims ranged in age from 11 to 16 and were
attending a century-old post-Easter gathering at the zoo celebrating
African-American families. Police were investigating whether the shooting was
gang related and sought at least one teen-age gunman who fired a handgun into
groups of youths after a confrontation escalated to bottle throwing and then
shots, according to authorities and witnesses. A high-ranking police official
said a boy, either 11 or 12 years old, was shot in the head and declared brain
dead at a hospital. The boy was being kept alive by machines to allow his family
to donate his organs, the official said.

Miami Cuban Exiles Call For Strike
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Cuban-Americans upset over the Elian Gonzalez case called for a
general strike that would turn Miami into a ''dead city'' Tuesday, leading
dozens of businesses to announce plans to close. Protesters pledged Monday to
shut Miami down quietly, in contrast to the violent protests that broke out when
armed federal agents grabbed the 6-year-old boy from his Miami relatives' house
before dawn Saturday and brought him to his father. Officials with the Miami
airport, the Port of Miami, law enforcement, schools and several banks all said
operations would continue, though they acknowledged nonessential workers may
take personal days. Many non-Cuban businesses also said they expected no
interruptions in service.

Microsoft: Breakup Is Unnecessary
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. on Monday denounced as ''extreme and
radical'' a reported government proposal to break up the software giant. Its
stock price fell both on recent earnings reports and uncertainty about the
company's future. Attorneys for the Justice Department and the 19 states that
successfully sued Microsoft for antitrust violations are considering ways to
break up the company as a way to stop its anticompetitive practices, a source
close to the talks said Monday. However, any kind of divestiture is part of a
''full array of options'' being discussed, the source said.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Widening his investigation, Independent Counsel Robert Ray
is conducting interviews and has issued a subpoena to find out whether
administration officials tried to obstruct investigators by not turning over
e-mails. The move immerses Ray deeper into the most recent Clinton
administration controversy at a time when the independent's office is trying to
finish its six-year investigation -- and decide whether the president should be
indicted when he leaves office. Ray's office issued a subpoena last Tuesday to
the National Archives and Records Administration, the government's official
custodian of documents.

3 Workers Killed in Fall From Bridge
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- Construction scaffolding tore away from a bridge Monday,
killing three ironworkers and injuring two others in a 60-foot plunge into the
shallows of the Illinois River. A sixth worker on a construction barge below the
McClugage Bridge was treated for hypothermia after jumping into the cold water
in an attempt to help his co-workers. The ironworkers were replacing rusted
metal plates in the bridge's floor, Franklin said. The scaffolding, about 30
feet wide and 16 feet long, was suspended underneath the bridge. It fell into
about five feet of murky, brown water.

<HEADLINE> Three Charged in LA Police Scandal  </HEADLINE>
By LEON DROUIN KEITH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Three police officers were accused of
conspiring to frame a suspect Monday, marking the first criminal
charges alleging corruption in the Police Department's Rampart
station anti-gang unit.
</P>
<P>
   Sgts. Edward Ortiz and Brian Liddy and Officer Paul Harper
surrendered, posted bail and were immediately released. They were
accused of framing a suspected gang member on a weapons charge in
April 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The three are among at least 70 officers who came under scrutiny
last year, after disgraced ex-officer Rafael Perez told
investigators he and other anti-gang-unit officers framed suspects
and falsified evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz, 43, and Liddy, 38, face counts of filing a false report
and conspiracy. Harper, 33, is charged with perjury and conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   The charges involve a weapons conviction against Allan Manrique
Lobos that was overturned Feb. 1. Lobos is one of 67 people so far
to have their convictions reversed in connection with alleged
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Court records show Perez told investigators he believed Harper
and Liddy planted a gun and then claimed they saw Lobos place it in
a car's wheel well. Lobos remains in prison for an unrelated murder
case.
</P>
<P>
   ''In this case, however, Mr. Lobos is the victim,'' District
Attorney Gil Garcetti told a news conference. ''There can be no
excuse for intentional crimes committed by police officers.''
</P>
<P>
   Charges against Ortiz, Liddy and Harper needed to be filed by
Wednesday to meet the deadline set by the statute of limitations.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Chief Martin Pomeroy said Harper and Liddy are on
administrative leave with pay pending a review hearing, and Ortiz
is on unpaid leave.
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti said other cases also are near their legal time limits
for filing charges, but none within the next two weeks. He would
not say how many cases have statute of limitations deadlines
looming.
</P>
<P>
   At least 30 officers, including three sergeants, have been
relieved of duty, suspended, fired or have quit in the wake of the
corruption scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal surfaced last year after Perez, facing prison time
for stealing cocaine from an evidence room, began telling
investigators of cases in which Rampart anti-gang-unit officers
framed, beat and shot innocent people.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton: Giuliani exploiting Elian Gonzalez  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Rudolph Giuliani is exploiting the Elian
Gonzalez situation, perhaps as a prelude to using it for
fund-raising purposes, according to Senate rival Hillary Rodham
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''At a time that cried out for healing, the mayor chose to
exploit this situation by making divisive attacks on the United
States law enforcement officers,'' Clinton said Monday in a
statement. ''Calling U.S. law enforcement 'storm troopers' is
extreme and unwarranted.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani camp denied any plans to use the case for fund
raising and the mayor, berating the Clinton administration and the
news media, said his complaints about the handling of the situation
''comes from things that I really believe very, very strongly.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first comment from the first lady since heavily armed
immigration officers forced their way into the Miami home of the
6-year-old's relatives on Saturday and took him away for a reunion
with his father at Andrews Air Force Base near Washington.
</P>
<P>
   While not saying whether she approved of the tactics used in the
raid, the first lady said ''Saturday's action was accomplished
rapidly and without injury, and I hope that the appropriate,
ongoing legal process will now conclude as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   She did say that she was ''relieved that Elian has been reunited
with his father.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is time for all of us to take a deep breath and allow Elian
and his father to spend time together outside of the media and
political spotlight,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday and again on Sunday, Giuliani took the Clinton
administration to task for sending in armed officers. Comparing the
officers to ''storm troopers,'' Giuliani said he ''couldn't imagine
that something like this could happen in America.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, at a news conference in Brooklyn, Giuliani called the
raid ''unprecedented and unconscionable.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm entitled to give that viewpoint and the mere fact that I'm
in politics doesn't mean that I shouldn't have a viewpoint,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate statement Monday, Clinton campaign spokesman
Howard Wolfson raised the specter of Giuliani using the situation
as a possible fund-raising device.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today, we are challenging Rudy Giuliani not to mention Elian
Gonzalez in any of his future secret fund-raising letters,''
Wolfson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hillary does not look at a 6-year-old boy as a political
opportunity,'' the Clinton aide added. ''It's a shame that the
mayor does.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson noted that Giuliani had unsuccessfully tried to get
Elian Gonzalez to join him in Times Square on New Year's Eve to
kick off the Millennium celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the fund-raising possibilities, Giuliani campaign
manager Bruce Teitelbaum said ''the mayor has made it clear to me
he does not want the campaign to politicize this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The only links between Elian Gonzalez and campaign cash are
the donations made by Gregory Craig and his partners at Williams &AMP;
Connolly who have contributed thousands of dollars to Mrs.
Clinton's campaign,'' Teitelbaum added.
</P>
<P>
   Craig, a Washington lawyer who helped defend President Clinton
during the impeachment process, is representing Elian Gonzalez'
father. He has contributed at least $1,000 to Clinton's Senate
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Other members of Craig's law firm have contributed at least
$8,000 to the first lady's campaign, Teitelbaum said.

<HEADLINE> Lyme ticks could be prevalent this summer  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL HILL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The ticks that spread Lyme disease could be
abundant this year in the wake of two mild winters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Personally, I expect a horrendous year,'' said David Weld,
executive director of the American Lyme Disease Foundation in
Westchester County. Weld said the deer ticks can more easily thrive
after the mild winters.
</P>
<P>
   The recent wet spell could also increase the number of surviving
ticks, said state Health Department spokeswoman Claire Pospisil. It
is difficult to predict if ticks will be more prevalent this
summer, Pospisil said, but ''given the conditions, this could put
people at a higher risk for Lyme disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyme disease is caused by bacteria carried by the pin-sized
ticks, which normally live on mice and deer. The disease usually
causes a telltale bull's-eye rash and if left untreated can damage
the heart and nervous system and cause arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   While weather could help usher in a bumper crop of ticks this
year, Weld said other factors could contribute.
</P>
<P>
   He said the thriving deer population in New York and nearby
states gives ticks a greater chance of finding a host. He added
that tick populations tend to increase every second year due to the
animal's life cycle. An expansion is due this year.
</P>
<P>
   New York state accounts for about 30 percent of all Lyme disease
cases reported nationally, Pospisil said. Preliminary 1999 figures
show 4,260 cases reported statewide, down from 4,408 from the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Cases were reported throughout the state, but the Hudson Valley
and Long Island were trouble spots. Dutchess County reported the
most cases last year (1,385), followed by Suffolk County (847) and
Westchester County (552).
</P>
<P>
   State health officials list 186 reported cases so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   Pospisil stressed people should take precautions if they plan to
be outdoors -- particularly if they are walking through high grass.
Precautions could include wearing light clothing, using insect
repellents and tucking pant cuffs into socks.
</P>
<P>
   People are also encouraged to check for the tiny ticks on their
skin after spending time outside.
</P>
<P>
   A Lyme disease vaccine was approved by the Food and Drug
Adminstration and has been on the market for more than a year.

<HEADLINE> Environmentalists ask GE stockholders to support PCB cleanup  </HEADLINE>
By L. ANNE NEWELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- State Comptroller H. Carl McCall and New
York City Comptroller Alan Hevesi are siding with environmental
groups urging General Electric to adopt a public education program
about the dangers of PCBs.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, one of 11 that will be voted on at the company's
annual shareholder meeting in Richmond, Va., on Wednesday, requires
the electric giant to report on plans to end further PCB
contamination in the Hudson and Housatonic rivers, develop ways to
cooperate with government agencies in cleanup and release details
of education efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ''General Electric has the wherewithal to ... make sure people
are aware of these issues,'' said Rich Schiafo, an environmental
associate with Scenic Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Schiafo's group, along with several other environmental and
religious organizations, is also asking shareholders to support a
proposal that would require GE to detail how much it has cost to
clean PCBs it released in the rivers decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   That proposal also requires that GE disclose how much it has
spent cleaning up its image through lobbying and public relations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to see how much money they've spent dragging their
feet on the cleanup,'' said Baret Pinyoun, a regional
representative for the Sierra Club. ''This has been going on for
over 10 years now.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the campaign, the groups encouraged McCall and
Hevesi, along with comptrollers in other states, to vote their
share of pension fund investments in GE in favor of the proposals.
</P>
<P>
   McCall will vote New York's 11 million shares in favor of the
education proposal, said Dennis Tompkins, spokesman for the
comptroller's office. McCall had not decided whether to support the
other proposal, Tompkins said. McCall is the pension manager for GE
stock through the $100 billion state and local retirement pension
system.
</P>
<P>
   Hevesi's office said he will vote his city's approximately 12.9
million shares in favor of both proposals. Hevesi is manager of the
city's retirement system.
</P>
<P>
   But even with comptrollers' support, neither Pinyoun nor Schiafo
expected either proposal to pass. GE has about 2.1 million
shareholders who own about 3.3 billion shares of stock.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the education proposal has come up at the company's past
two shareholders meetings and garnered less than 10 percent of
shareholders' support. But the groups say just getting the
proposals to a vote is a victory in itself.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an effort to educate and keep these issues in front of
those people who are a part of General Electric,'' Shiafo said.
''We want people to know this is still an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolutions also don't have the support of GE. Mark Behan, a
company spokesman, called both resolutions unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   ''We report regularly to the state and federal agencies on our
cleanup work and research,'' Behan said. ''We've met every state
and federal requirement on the Hudson.''
</P>
<P>
   Behan said requiring GE to release monetary figures for cleanup
and lobbying doesn't make sense, since his company files normal
lobbying expenditure reports and acknowledges spending about $165
million so far on PCB cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   Behan also dismissed the education proposal, saying New York
already advises people not to eat fish caught in certain stretches
of the Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe those efforts have been highly visible and we
believe the role of establishing and publicizing fishing
restrictions and advisories properly rests with state or federal
regulatory agencies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   GE opposes an environmentalist-backed plan to dredge portions of
the Hudson River where PCBs have accumulated, a project would cost
hundreds of millions of dollars. The company maintains dredging
would only stir up PCBs and disperse them throughout the river. It
favors allowing the PCBs to be buried by the normal flow of the
river.
</P>
<P>
   GE legally used polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, for 30 years
in plants in Fort Edward and Hudson Falls before the chemical was
banned in 1977 by the federal government. The PCBs, which were used
in electrical equipment, have been linked to cancer in laboratory
animals. Their effect on humans is less clear.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency will make a final decision
on how to best clean the Hudson in June 2001.

<HEADLINE> Rebels Take Blame For Kidnappings  </HEADLINE>
By PAT ROQUE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- Muslim rebels who have been
holding 27 Filipinos hostage at a remote mountain stronghold in the
Philippines claimed responsibility Tuesday for also abducting about
20 people from a nearby Malaysian tourist island.
</P>
<P>
   Philippine officials, however, expressed skepticism over the
claim by the extremist Abu Sayyaf rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The claim came as troops battled their way up the densely
forested mountain in the Philippines where the Muslim extremists
were holding their captives.
</P>
<P>
   Helicopter gunships pounded three outlying Abu Sayyaf camps with
rockets again Tuesday, said Lt. Gen. Diomedio Villanueva, chief of
the military's Southern Command. He said the ground troops were
pursuing fleeing rebels, and the troops next plan to advance to the
main stronghold further up the mountain, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The assault, which began Saturday, has been slowed by heavy
vegetation and by land mines, which have forced the troops to
employ metal detectors, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   As that assault progressed, about 20 people, including foreign
tourists, were abducted Sunday night by heavily armed attackers on
a nearby Malaysian island and taken by boat toward the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Philippine officials initially said they were investigating
possible links to the Abu Sayyaf. Police there said the kidnappers
in Malaysia spoke Tausug, a language spoken in parts of the
southern Philippines, but not in Basilan, where the Abu Sayyaf
rebels operate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our group is behind the abduction of the foreigners (in
Malaysia) and there are still a lot of surprises for the government
if they won't listen to us,'' Abu Sayyaf spokesman Abu Ahmad said
in an interview over local radio station DXRZ.
</P>
<P>
   The government has refused several rebel demands, including the
release of three Arab terrorists held in jails in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Philippine Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said the military
is still determining whether the Abu Sayyaf is actually responsible
for the Malaysian abductions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't just jump and believe the Abu Sayyaf immediately. We
will verify and confirm this,'' he told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The 20 hostages, including foreign tourists and local resort
workers, were abducted late Sunday from Malaysia's Sipadan Island
by six heavily armed men and taken on two fishing boats toward the
Philippines, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The 27 Filipino hostages -- who include many schoolchildren -- are
believed to be held at the main rebel stronghold further up the
mountain, which Villanueva said his forces were avoiding shelling
to prevent injuries to the captives.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a hostage situation and we're considering the safety
of the hostages to give them the best chance to survive,''
Villanueva said.
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 Abu Sayyaf rebels and four soldiers have died in the
fighting in the hinterlands of the southern island province of
Basilan. The rebels have warned they will behead their five
remaining adult male hostages -- including a priest -- if the
military does not halt its assault.
</P>
<P>
   The group also announced last week that it had beheaded two male
teachers. The rebels, who are fighting for an independent Islamic
state in the predominantly Catholic Philippines, are demanding the
release of Muslim militants jailed in the United States, including
the mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf is the smaller but more radical of two Muslim
groups fighting for an independent state in the Philippines. It has
been blamed for numerous attacks on Christians.
</P>
<P>
   A rebel spokesman said two hostages, including a child, were
injured in the shelling of the rebel camp, but the claim could not
be independently verified.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages have been forced to stay in unprotected shacks
while the rebels have taken refuge in bunkers, a hostage told
ABS-CBN television in an interview by cellular telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Suspected Abu Sayyaf rebels attacked an army outpost in Jolo in
nearby Sulu province late Sunday, injuring seven soldiers and five
civilians, Sulu police chief Candido Casimiro said.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels originally seized more than 50 hostages, including
many children, from two schools in Basilan on March 20 for use as
human shields after attacking another army outpost. About half of
the hostages have since been freed.
</P>
<P>
   The group has demanded freedom for World Trade Center bomber
Ramzi Yousef, and Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, accused of conspiring to
blow up New York City landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   The demands were rejected by the Philippine government and by
the U.S. Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   In retaliation for the abduction, a group of vigilantes seized
11 relatives of Abu Sayyaf leader Khadaffy Janjalani. They still
held nine relatives after freeing Janjalani's pregnant wife and a
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department has included the Abu Sayyaf in a list
of 28 foreign groups that threaten Americans at home or abroad.

<HEADLINE> American Airlines Talks Break Down  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID KOENIG, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Talks designed to shore up the rocky relationship
between American Airlines and its pilots have failed to produce a
contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean a strike is imminent -- the pilots are under
contract until August 2001. But the end of talks seemed to signal
one more lost opportunity to ease tension between the nation's No.
2 carrier and the Allied Pilots Association.
</P>
<P>
   The main sticking point in the negotiations was union opposition
to plans by American's sister airline, American Eagle, to enlarge
its fleet of regional jets. American Eagle has firm orders to buy
15 new 70-passenger jets next year and eight the following year, a
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   According to union spokesman Gregg Overman, the planned 2002
purchases would violate their contract, which limits American Eagle
to 67 jets holding 45 or more passengers. The pilots bargained for
the 67-jet cap because they didn't want a large fleet of small jets
cannibalizing flights flown by American captains.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're hesitant to call these 'regional jets,''' Overman said.
''Some of them can fly pretty long routes.''
</P>
<P>
   American spokeswoman Karen Watson said the airline has offered
to get an early start on next year's negotiations, scheduled to
start around July 1. She said the union has not responded to the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're disappointed we didn't reach agreement'' in the talks on
a contract extension, Watson said, ''but we're encouraged with the
progress in establishing a better working relationship with the
APA.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent low point of relations between the pilots union
and the airline came in February 1999, when hundreds of pilots
carried out a sickout to protest American's integration of pilots
from a small regional carrier, Reno Air. The airline said the
sickout cost it $225 million in canceled flights.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge fined the union and its top officers $45.5
million for disobeying a back-to-work order. The union is appealing
the fine.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about any connection between the fine and the contract
talks, Overman said the union never asked the airline to drop the
fine in exchange for labor peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''It hasn't been a happy chapter between APA and the airline,''
Overman said. ''For that (fine) to go away would probably serve to
improve the relationship. But it's purely speculative as to whether
it would have been part of any deal.''

<HEADLINE> MGM, Showtime Extend Studio Pact  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN, AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- MGM has expanded its commitment to funnel
films to Showtime's premium-cable channels.
</P>
<P>
   The companies said Monday they are extending their deal to air
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's new feature films and have added titles from
the studio's library.
</P>
<P>
   MGM could gain up to $1.4 billion from the eight-year deal,
according to industry sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
That would mean a steady revenue stream to help the studio rebound
after a decade of annual losses.
</P>
<P>
   The studio announces first-quarter results today, and analysts
expect MGM to post a small profit.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 270 first-run films released by MGM and its United
Artists banner through 2008 will have exclusive premium-cable runs
on channels owned or operated by Showtime, including the Movie
Channel and Sundance Channel. That extends MGM's current first-run
deal with Showtime, which ran through 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Based on MGM's anticipated output of 12 to 20 films a year, that
likely means all of the studio's movies through 2008 will be part
of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Showtime and Paramount, both owned by Viacom, have a similar
deal for new feature films.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a very important strategic goal for our company to have
locked up for a long time two major studio suppliers for films,''
said Matthew Duda, Showtime executive vice president of programming
acquisition and planning.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also allows Showtime to license up to 1,200 movies from
MGM's library of 4,100 titles, which includes the ''Rocky'' and
''Pink Panther'' series, many Woody Allen movies and the James Bond
flicks.
</P>
<P>
   Those library titles would be licensed to Showtime
non-exclusively over six years, allowing MGM to air them on its own
planned cable or satellite network or other TV outlets.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've constructed this very carefully so we wouldn't step on
our own feet in terms of the broader cable-satellite area,'' said
MGM spokesman Craig Parsons.
</P>
<P>
   Also under the deal, MGM and Showtime plan to produce three
original TV series, premiering in 2003, 2005 and 2007. Showtime
also is renewing MGM's ''Stargate SG-1'' for a fifth season.
</P>
<P>
   The studio plans to launch a cable or satellite channel ''as
soon as possible,'' using its large library as a cornerstone, said
Jim Griffiths, president of worldwide television distribution for
MGM. A definite launch date has not been set.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Showtime deal means additional cash flow for us but in no
way impedes or puts any hindrance on us for MGM-owned or operated
networks,'' Griffiths said.
</P>
<P>
   Billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian, who owns about 90 percent
of MGM stock, last year installed new management including longtime
lieutenant Alex Yeminidjian as studio chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, management has bought or negotiated MGM out of
unfavorable licensing deals for its movie catalog, giving the
studio flexibility to plan its own TV service.
</P>
<P>
   After 11 years of steady losses, MGM ended last year with two
profitable quarters, and analysts reporting for First Call/Thomson
Financial expect the company to post a small profit when
first-quarter earnings are released Tuesday. For the year, MGM
continued to lose money in 1999, and analysts predict a small loss
again this year but a profit in 2001.

<HEADLINE> Specialty Toy Retailers Join Forces  </HEADLINE>
By RACHEL BECK, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Specialty toy retailer Zany Brainy Inc. is
buying rival Noodle Kidoodle Inc. for $35 million.
</P>
<P>
   The deal announced Monday will create a 163-store chain under
the Zany Brainy name selling a wide-range of educational toys.
Combined sales topped more than $370 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts called the merger a smart combination that will help
strengthen Zany Brainy's position against larger bricks-and-mortar
toy stores and those that operate on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''This deal makes a lot of sense because these chains have a
complementary presence and overlap a lot in what they sell in their
stores,'' said Richard Fradin, an analyst at Chicago-based William
Blair &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Both Zany Brainy and Noodle Kidoodle are known for their
brightly colored stores filled with play areas so kids can try the
toys before they buy. The chains also offer lots of in-store
activities, such as readings from popular authors and software
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Shelves are stocked mostly with toys that have an educational
slant, including everything from kite-making kits to magic show
sets.
</P>
<P>
   Many items are made by small, lesser-known manufacturers. In
fact, only about 30 percent of the products found at Zany Brainy
overlap with the larger chains like Toys R Us.
</P>
<P>
   Both chains pride themselves on top-notch customer service,
staffing knowledgeable salespeople who have a special interest in
children -- such as former teachers and librarians.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, both chains mostly considered mom-and-pop toy
shops as their rivals. But in recent years, many mass-market chains
and online toy shops have been putting some pressure on Zany Brainy
and Noodle Kidoodle's businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the deal will help the chains fend off their new --
and fast-growing -- competition.
</P>
<P>
   For one, they can cut costs by slashing duplicate personnel,
getting better deals on merchandise since they are buying for a
larger number of stores and consolidating their online operations.
The deal will also strengthen Zany Brainy's position in New York,
Florida, Michigan and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the year, the companies plan to add 27 new stores
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, 1.233 Zany Brainy shares will be exchanged
for each Noodle Kidoodle share. The deal, which still needs
shareholder and regulatory approval, is expected to close by the
end of the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Keith C. Spurgeon will remain chairman and chief executive of
Zany Brainy, which was founded in 1991 in the Philadelphia suburb
of Wynnewood.
</P>
<P>
   Noodle Kidoodle's chief executive, Stanley Greenman, will help
with the integration of the two companies and serve on the Zany
Brainy board of directors. Greenman was one of the founders of the
7-year-old Syosset, N.Y.-based chain.
</P>
<P>
   While Zany Brainy expects the deal to boost future earnings, the
company said Monday that it expects its first-quarter loss to be
bigger than expected due to a drop-off in sales of such hot
products as Beanie Babies and Crazy Bones.
</P>
<P>
   Noodle Kidoodle also said Monday that its losses will exceed
those tallied in the first quarter last year.

<HEADLINE> Gunmen Take Hostages in Malaysia  </HEADLINE>
By RANJAN ROY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEMPORNA, Malaysia (AP) -- Rescue teams were searching Southeast
Asian seas on Tuesday for assailants who abducted 20 hostages from
a Malaysian diving resort -- an attack that Philippine Muslim rebels
claimed they carried out.
</P>
<P>
   Muslim rebels in the Philippines who are seeking the release of
militants jailed in the World Trade Center bombing case claimed
responsibility Tuesday for the Malaysian kidnapping. Philippine
officials, who were helping coordinate the rescue attempt, quickly
expressed skepticism over the statement.
</P>
<P>
   An American couple escaped the Sunday evening attack in Malaysia
by refusing to swim out to the kidnappers' boats and then hiding
overnight in nearby bushes.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysian Defense Minister Najib Tun Razak said Monday that an
air-and-sea search team had determined where the hostages -- half of
whom were foreign tourists -- were being held, following their
abduction on the lush Sipadan Island in eastern Malaysia. Najib did
not give details.
</P>
<P>
   But Semporna police chief Sulaiman Junaidi said Tuesday that
authorities had yet to pinpoint the abductor's hideout. ''We're
tracking them down,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Nafir Sakaran, a state Cabinet minister at police headquarters
in Semporna, told The Associated Press Tuesday that marine police
and navy reinforcements have been brought in. ''The military has
been called out. We have soldiers who are riding on patrol boats,
working with the Philippine navy.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack began when six masked gunmen, carrying AK-47s and a
rocket launcher and speaking a Philippine language, grabbed
tourists and workers and confiscated their cash and jewelry, Norian
said.
</P>
<P>
   A local marine photographer said one of the attackers identified
himself as a police officer and told him to give up his watch and
cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
   ''At first I thought he was joking ... but when I refused to
obey his orders, he held a gun to my head,'' Danny Chin, 48, was
quoted as saying by the national news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
   Chin said he hid in the woods while the kidnappers ransacked the
resort.
</P>
<P>
   The attackers then forced their hostages to swim a distance to
two fishing boats, which then sped away and appeared to be heading
into Philippine waters, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the captives -- James and Mary Murphy, both 51, of
Rochester, N.Y. -- managed to escape. Eyewitnesses said Mary Murphy
didn't know how to swim, and her husband told the assailants they'd
have to shoot him if they forced her into the water. The kidnappers
apparently let them go, and the American couple ran into the bushes
and hid until dawn.
</P>
<P>
   The Murphys, who have been living in Australia the past two
years, arrived in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, on Monday
evening but said they didn't want to talk to the media extensively
until the hostages are released.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to do anything that would endanger their lives,''
James Murphy told The Associated Press at the airport. ''We haven't
slept yet, but yes, we are fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The hostages forced onto the fishing boats included two French
tourists, three Germans, two South Africans, two Finns and one
Lebanese, as well as a Filipino worker and nine Malaysians,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   In Basilan, Philippines, Philippine troops shelled rebel camps
again Tuesday as soldiers battled their way up a mountain where Abu
Sayyaf rebels were holding 27 Filipinos captive.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our group is behind the abduction of the foreigners (in
Malaysia) and there are still a lot of surprises for the government
if they won't listen to us,'' Abu Ahmad, spokesman for the
Philippine rebel group Abu Sayyaf, said in an interview over local
radio station DXRZ.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have demanded the freedom of three Arab terrorist
suspects in U.S. jails, including Ramzi Yousef, mastermind of the
1993 bombing of the World Trade Center in New York, and Sheik Omar
Abdel-Rahman, accused of conspiring to blow up New York City
landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   Philippine Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said the military
is still determining whether the Abu Sayyaf, which is fighting for
an independent Islamic state in the predominantly Catholic
Philippines, is actually responsible for the Malaysian abductions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't just jump and believe the Abu Sayyaf immediately. We
will verify and confirm this,'' he told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the rebel announcement, Col. Ernesto de Guzman, chief
of staff of the Philippine military's Southern Command, said
officials were trying to determine whether there was a connection
with the hostage situation on the southern Philippine island of
Basilan, about 275 miles northeast of Semporna, the port from which
tourists take boats for Sipadan.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1969, Malaysia and Indonesia have both claimed sovereignty
over Sipadan and Ligitan, another Celebes Sea island. But there
were no indications that the hostage-takers were involved in the
territorial dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Chong Kah Kiat, tourism minister for Sabah, said he was
concerned that the attack would scare off the 400,000 tourists who
visit Sabah beaches and rain forests every year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at the airport in Kuala Lumpur, Mary Murphy was close
to tears.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really need to talk to our children,'' she told the AP.
''We really want to get to the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, an executive for Eastman Kodak Co. in Sydney,
Australia, said they had not slept since Sunday night but were
otherwise fine.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's got lots of bites from sleeping in the bushes, a lot of
sand fleas,'' he said, pointing to his wife's legs, which were
covered with a rash of insect bites.
</P>
<P>
   As cameras flashed around them, Mary Murphy, wearing plaid
Bermuda shorts, said all she wanted was ''a good night's sleep and
a hot shower.''

<HEADLINE> China Police Arrest 95 Falun Gong  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN LEICESTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Falun Gong followers by the dozens unfurled
banners and sat silently in Tiananmen Square Tuesday, prompting
swift arrest from police, as the spiritual group marked the first
anniversary of a mass protest that provoked a Chinese government
ban.
</P>
<P>
   Police detained at least 95 people in and around the square
Tuesday morning. The vast plaza in Beijing's center seemed a swirl
of chaos with small-scale protests erupting in all directions.
Officers sometimes reacted violently, even though they were
expecting the anniversary protests.
</P>
<P>
   One officer punched a man in the face as he and three others
tried to raise a banner. Fifteen people who sat in meditation on
the square were jerked to their feet and pushed into a minibus.
Police muzzled a middle-aged woman and pulled her backward as she
tried to yell.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Great Way of Falun is good,'' shouted one middle-aged
protester, leaning out a police bus window, his fist raised.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign tourists, their mouths agape in surprise, watched the
protests and their suppression. A tour guide told one group of
American tourists not to photograph anyone in uniform. ''China is
still a comparatively strict country,'' the guide explained.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese tourists, too, eagerly ran across the square to glimpse
the rare acts of civil disobedience.
</P>
<P>
   The charged atmosphere and violence stood in contrast with the
event sect members were commemorating. On April 25 last year,
10,000 group members surrounded the communist leadership compound
near Tiananmen, meditating in silence for a day to protest official
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Then police kept their distance. But the group's ability to
mobilize followers alarmed Chinese leaders. President Jiang Zemin
ordered a crackdown. In July Falun Gong was officially proscribed,
its leading members arrested and its rank-and-file told to recant
or face jail.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, peaceful, defiant protests by Falun Gong adherents
have become a daily sight in Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   Since the April 25 demonstration, ''we have come to witness the
Chinese government execute one of the largest, harshest and most
arbitrary persecutions in modern history,'' Gail Rachlin, a New
York-based spokeswoman for Falun Gong, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Chinese leaders turned their country upside down'' by banning
the group, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   It said 35,000 followers have been detained, with another 5,000
sent without trial to labor camps. Practitioners have been
tortured, held in psychiatric institutions and given anti-psychotic
drugs while others have lost jobs or been refused permission to
attend school, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong attracted millions of followers with its blend of
traditional beliefs, slow-motion exercises and the ideas of founder
Li Hongzhi, a former government grain clerk who now lives in New
York. Followers say Falun Gong promotes health and good
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Three Falun Gong followers protested Monday on Tiananmen Square
and were quickly detained by police.
</P>
<P>
   Despite heavy security, the three middle-aged men raised their
arms in a meditation pose. Plainclothes police patrolling among the
throngs of tourists on the square ordered the men to put their arms
down, and within minutes led them to a police van that drove them
away.
</P>
<P>
   The government says Falun Gong is an evil cult that threatened
public order and Communist Party rule, and led 1,500 followers to
their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   In another official report about the group's alleged misdeeds,
police in eastern China's Weifang city arrested three principal
Falun Gong members for cheating other followers of $36,000,
state-run newspapers said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Tan Weijun, Li Weihua and his wife, Li Fang, told followers that
Tan was even more powerful than Falun Gong founder Li Hongzhi, the
Guangming Daily and other newspapers reported. The accounts said
they promised Tan's protection if followers donated money.
</P>
<P>
   The three allegedly concocted the scam to pay a $4,200 fine from
August for selling Falun Gong literature.

<HEADLINE> Zoo Shooting Leaves Boy Brain Dead  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ZUCKERBROD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A feud between youths at the National Zoo
ended in a hail of gunfire Monday evening, leaving one boy brain
dead and wounding five other children at one of the capital's most
popular tourist sites, police officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Police were investigating whether the shooting was gang related
and sought at least one teen-age gunman who fired a handgun into
groups of youths after a confrontation escalated to bottle throwing
and then shots, according to authorities and witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The victims ranged in age from 11 to 16 and were attending a
century-old post-Easter gathering at the zoo celebrating
African-American families.
</P>
<P>
   A high-ranking police official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said a boy, either 11 or 12 years old, was shot in the
head and declared brain dead at a hospital. The boy was being kept
alive by machines to allow his family to donate his organs, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Children's Hospital National Medical Center, where
the boy was being treated, would only say the boy remained in very
critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   A 12-year-old girl was in serious condition with a wound to the
pelvis, a 14-year-old boy was in serious condition with a leg
wound, and three other youths were hospitalized with less serious
injuries, according to officials at the hospitals where they were
treated.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, police still circled the zoo in helicopters. ''We
are looking into the possibility that it is gang-related, but we
are not certain,'' Police Chief Charles Ramsey said.
</P>
<P>
   Kweisi Mfume, president of the NAACP, told The Associated Press
early Tuesday that the civil rights organization was offering a
$25,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction
of those responsible for the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ''This type of random violence is repulsive, and it must not be
allowed to go unpunished.
</P>
<P>
   The zoo, a unit of the Smithsonian Institution, is one of the
most visited sites in Washington, drawing 3 million local residents
and tourists each year. Nestled inside one of northwest
Washington's wealthiest neighborhoods, it has seldom experienced
violence and was better known for the rare Chinese pandas it housed
for over two decades.
</P>
<P>
   The gunfire shortly after 6 p.m. EDT in broad daylight stunned
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not bringing them back. These are my grandkids. It is not
safe,'' said Sandra Edwards, who was visiting the zoo with her
grandchildren when she heard the shots and saw youths fighting.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the shootings, a seventh victim suffered a
seizure and a pregnant woman was taken to the hospital after going
into apparent labor, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the shooting occurred near the entrance along
Connecticut Avenue, one of the city's main thoroughfares.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Chief Terrance Gainer said police suspected a 9 mm
handgun was used and roped off two shooting scenes -- one just
outside the zoo entrance and the other about 300 feet inside the
zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Nakisha Johnson, 17, said she saw one young man open fire after
a feud between youths became violent. She said the children who
were wounded were caught in the middle of the two groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was just shooting at the people he was fighting'' but
struck the children bystanders, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The zoo planned to remain closed Tuesday. ''It is just a
terrible, terrible tragedy. Our hearts go out to the families,''
zoo spokesman Robert Hoage said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the shooting occurred when a bottle was thrown
from one group of youths at some other youths in a crowd near the
zoo gate. A piece of glass struck a young woman in the face, and
then shots rang out, the witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Anthony Williams visited Children's Hospital to console
victims' families.
</P>
<P>
   About an hour after the shooting, Vice President Al Gore
announced the shootings at a Democratic fund-raiser in New York
City, bringing gasps from the audience that included actress Lauren
Bacall. ''We really have to have mandatory child safety trigger
locks,'' Gore told the crowd, sounding a frequent administration
theme.
</P>
<P>
   The zoo was established by Congress in 1889 as part of the
Smithsonian Institution. It covers 163 wooded acres along Rock
Creek in the heart of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Though located on one of the capital's main boulevards, it has
seldom experienced violence.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, a Little Rock, Ark., woman was found mauled to death in
the lion exhibit. Police and the medical examiner ruled the death a
suicide.

<HEADLINE> Jazz 101, SuperSonics 87  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Twenty-three points were more than enough
this time for Karl Malone and the Utah Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Malone had fewer than half the 50 points he scored in Game 1,
but the Jazz didn't need nearly that many Tuesday night in a 101-87
victory over the Seattle SuperSonics. Utah took a 2-0 lead in the
best-of-five series.
</P>
<P>
   Game 3 is Saturday at Seattle, which trailed by 17 at halftime
Tuesday and 27 at the end of three periods. Only 12 teams have
rallied to win a series after trailing 2-0, and none since the
Houston Rockets in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   John Stockton had 21 points and 11 assists for the Jazz, who
shot 56 percent and rested their starters in the fourth quarter.
Bryon Russell added 19 points and substitute Howard Eisley had 15,
including four 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Malone became the fourth player in NBA history with 4,000 points
in the playoffs, joining Michael Jordan (5,987 points), Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar (5,762) and Jerry West (4,457).
</P>
<P>
   He passed the 4,000-point mark on a layup with 4:32 left in the
third period on an assist from -- who else? -- Stockton. Malone
finished the game with 4,004 playoff points.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Payton had 20 points for the Sonics, but also had seven
turnovers and just one assist. Rashard Lewis added 19 for Seattle,
which never led.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead 57-40 at halftime, the Jazz opened the second half with
four straight baskets -- two by Malone -- to build their margin to 25
points. A no-look backward layup by Jeff Hornacek made it 73-47
with 6:35 left in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz led 86-59 entering the fourth quarter, and scored seven
straight points, including a long 3-pointer by Eisley as the
24-second clock expired, to take a 93-59 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz went 6-for-11 on 3-pointers in the first half, with
Russell, Stockton and Eisley hitting two each, and Utah took a
17-point halftime lead. The Sonics were just 2-of-6 on 3-pointers
in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Stockton, who hit a 3-pointer in the closing seconds of the half
to give Utah its margin, and Russell each had 13 points in the
first half. Payton had 13 for Seattle, but he had five turnovers
and no assists in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Utah opened the game with a 10-2 run that included consecutive
3-pointers by Russell, but Seattle responded with eight straight
points to tie it. The Sonics tied the game again at 12, but trailed
the rest of the game.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Seattle's Emanual Davis sat out his second straight game
with an injured facial nerve. He missed the last 16 games of the
regular season with the same problem. ... Adam Keefe missed his
second straight game for Utah with a strained right hamstring. ...
Hornacek had six points to push his career playoff total to 1,996.
He could become the 31st player to reach the 2,000-point mark,
though Kevin Johnson of the Phoenix Suns could beat him there.
Johnson has 1,999 points. ... Payton, who played all 48 minutes in
Game 1, played every minute of the first three quarters Tuesday,
but sat out the final period.

<HEADLINE> Indians 6, Mariners 0  </HEADLINE>
By JIM COUR, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Chuck Finley pitched two-hit ball for eight
innings and struck out 10 as the Cleveland Indians cooled off the
Seattle Mariners 6-0 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Finley (2-0) worked around four walks in the first inning,
helped when Mike Cameron was thrown out trying to steal. Jay Buhner
flied out with the bases loaded to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Finley walked seven and threw a wild pitch. He improved
his career record to 19-7 against the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Karsay pitched a hitless ninth to complete the combined
shutout.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians traveled to Seattle after being rained out for three
consecutive games at Boston. Cleveland improved its road record to
8-2, best in the majors, and ended the Mariners' three-game winning
streak.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Wilson singled up the middle with one out in the fifth and
Charles Gipson singled off second baseman Roberto Alomar's glove in
the eighth for Seattle's hits.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians scored two runs in the first off Gil Meche (0-2).
Manny Ramirez had a sacrifice fly and Jim Thome added an RBI
single.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, Cleveland made it 5-0. Alomar had a run-scoring
single, Ramirez added another sacrifice fly and Thome had an RBI
double.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Fryman homered off Kevin Hodges to lead off the ninth.
Notes: David Justice upended Mariners second baseman David Bell in
the fourth while breaking up a double play. Bell had some angry
words for Justice, who had some angry words in return. Teammates
stepped between the players. ... Finley's 19 victories against
Seattle are his most against any team. He's the third-winningest
pitcher against the Mariners -- Roger Clemens and Dave Stewart each
have 20 victories.

<HEADLINE> Minimum wage bill heads to Senate  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The state's minimum wage would be boosted
55 cents by 2002 under a bill slated for debate in the state
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which passed the House 99 to 45 on Monday, would
increase the hourly minimum wage from $6.15 to $6.40 on Jan. 1,
2001. A year later, the wage would be $6.70.
</P>
<P>
   ''People earning minimum wage can't afford housing, can't afford
health care and can't afford the time to further their education or
training,'' said Rep. Christopher Donovan, D-Meriden. ''You can't
live on minimum wage.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ernest Newton, D-Bridgeport, said the bill helps people who
are getting jobs after coming off public assistance under the
state's welfare reform laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all take credit for cutting the welfare rolls,'' Newton
said. ''And we send people out in the market and they can't make
it.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a report by the state's Office of Policy and
Management released this month, a family of an adult, infant and
school-age child living in Hartford must make $15.83 an hour to
make ends meet. In the Stamford-Norwalk area, the same family would
have to earn $22.29 in order to avoid welfare, the study says.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our current minimum wage does not meet basic needs,'' Donovan
said.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents say forcing small business owners to pay their
workers a higher wage will be too much of a drain.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a hurt, if you will -- a pain, a consequence to
employers who are paying this increased minimum wage,'' said Rep.
Lawrence Cafero, R-Norwalk. ''When you are a small shop with two or
three employees and your minimum wage is going up 55 cents an hour
... that is not an insignificant thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would not increase the current base pays for waiters,
waitresses and bartenders. Waiters and waitresses make a minimum of
$4.74 an hour; the minimum wage for bartenders would remain $6.15.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the bill said the amount of money bartenders and
food servers make in tips always exceeds the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also allow 15 year olds to work in grocery stores
on Saturdays. Currently, they can only work in grocery stores
during school vacations.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of that provision said allowing children to work on
Saturdays will cut into the time they should devote to studying.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm saying 'whoa' -- this just flies directly in the face of
what we've been discussing for the last couple of years in terms of
what we're asking our young people to do,'' said Rep. Claudia
Powers, R-Greenwich.
</P>
<P>
   Other lawmakers said that provision discriminates against
religious children who observe Sabbath on Saturday. The bill does
not allow 15 year olds to work on Sundays because that is the day
before the school week begins, Donovan said.

<HEADLINE> PM-CT--Electric Forum, Conn Bjt, 476  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH FORMAN   
Associated Press Writer, 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- U.S. Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson
says that with the proper preparation, there should be no major
problems keeping the power on during the heat of the upcoming New
England summer.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government should examine back-up generators,
carefully monitor electric grid problems, conduct emergency
exercises and provide consumers with tips to reduce power
consumption, Richardson told lawmakers and industry officials at
Monday's New England Electricity Reliability Summit.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was held to address the region's needs for
electricity generation and transmission, and reduce the burden on
electric systems. Although power shortages are still a possibility
this summer, the region should be in good shape with these
short-term changes, Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all need to work together so no one is sitting in the dark
alone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer's heat waves threatened to overtax the electric
system throughout New England. The region surpassed peak power
demand twice last summer and flirted with records several other
times.
</P>
<P>
   When an early and especially harsh heat wave caught electricity
companies by surprise in early June, Gov. John G. Rowland and
neighboring governors sent state workers home in an effort to save
power.
</P>
<P>
   ''Utilities around the country were stretched to the limit,''
Richardson said. ''I do think New England has learned from last
summer.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ''we expect a hot summer and we have to be
ready.''
</P>
<P>
   On a more long-term basis, Richardson suggested the government
needs to invest in new power plants, offer more incentives for
utilities to import power to the region and explore new technology.
</P>
<P>
   Congress should also enact legislation governing the new, more
competitive electricity industry. Earlier this year, Richardson
released an Energy Department report that concluded the transition
under electric deregulation has strained distribution lines. The
report found some utilities were focusing on competing for markets
instead of assuring that power is kept flowing.
</P>
<P>
   And with a booming economy in New England, Richardson said, the
demand for electricity is growing.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland, U.S. Sen. Joseph Lieberman and U.S. Rep. John Larson
were among the state officials who attended Monday's summit.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously we saw last summer how important the reliability of
our power source is and how we cannot take it for granted,''
Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were all there early last June,'' the governor said. ''It
was a very difficult time for all of us. I don't want to go through
that again.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson has hosted similar reliability summits around the
country. He was set to be in Newark, N.J. and New Orleans later on
Monday, and in Sacramento, Calif. on April 28.

<HEADLINE> Police: Suspect pulled loaded gun on courthouse deputies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) -- State police have launched an
investigation to determine how an inmate who was in custody all
weekend managed to pull a gun on a sheriff's deputy inside New
London Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   No shots were fired Monday and no serious injuries were
reported.
</P>
<P>
   As he was being led out of the courthouse, Van Schryver shouted
at reporters that he pulled the gun in an attempt to commit
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was trying to blow my brains out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The internal affairs unit of the State Police was investigating
whether Schryver, 18, had the gun in his shoe all weekend in the
lockup of the State Police Troop F barracks in Westbrook.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not pushing this off on somebody else. He was in our
custody,'' said state police spokesman Lt. Ralph Carpenter. ''If it
was in his sneaker, we should have known about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The gun was found after Schryver, of Old Lyme, was brought into
Superior Court on an attempted murder charge stemming from a
Saturday standoff with police.
</P>
<P>
   Courthouse deputies were doing a routine search of the prisoner
when they asked him to remove his sneakers. Schryver then pulled a
loaded 9 mm Glock handgun out of his sneaker, said Carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   The incident happened in front of several other prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   ''He bent down to take his shoelaces out, and pulled the gun
straight up and brought it toward the cop,'' Leo Kontogouris, of
Groton, told WTIC-TV. ''We were all scared that he was going to
shoot everybody,''
</P>
<P>
   Deputies were able to subdue Schryver with pepper spray and
wrestle the gun away.
</P>
<P>
   No shots were fired, but some deputies and Schryver were injured
in the melee. The suspect and the deputies were treated at Lawrence
and Memorial Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   A gun used in the Saturday standoff was never found, so police
also were investigating whether this was the same gun, Carpenter
said.
</P>
<P>
   Troopers have a policy of conducting routine searches of all
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears it may have been an oversight,'' Carpenter said.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter said Public Safety Commissioner Henry Lee is reviewing
the lockup procedure to determine ''if it is clear enough and to
avoid it happening again.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee also praised the courthouse deputies who disarmed Schryver,
said Carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   ''They averted a real tragedy. We're just happy that no one was
hurt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More charges will be lodged against Schryver for the incident,
he said. Schryver is due back in court May 8.
</P>
<P>
   A New London judge continued Schryver's $1 million bond on
charges of attempted murder, attempt to commit capital felony,
interfering with an officer and several weapons counts.
</P>
<P>
   Police said he fired six shots at a trooper and barricaded
himself in the Florence Griswold Museum in Old Lyme on Saturday. He
was wanted on several warrants, including burglary and criminal
mischief. After the standoff, Schryver was initially transported to
Lawrence &AMP; Memorial Hospital in New London for observation before
being taken to the Westbrooks barracks.

<HEADLINE> Report shows decline in farmland, contamination in fish  </HEADLINE>
By NATASHA GURAL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Connecticut's environmental problems,
outlined in a new report from a government advisory group, are
mostly regional or national in scope, the state's top environmental
official said.
</P>
<P>
   In it's annual report, the Council on Environmental Quality said
the state is losing about 2 percent of its farmland each year and
fish in all of the state's rivers and lakes are contaminated with
mercury. The annual report was released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is interesting, long-term work that the Council on
Environmental Quality does and over a decade or longer, I think
they provide useful trend information,'' DEP Commissioner Arthur
Rocque Jr. said.
</P>
<P>
   The report also showed gains in tidal wetlands, strong
improvements to shellfish beds and a return of ospreys to the
state.
</P>
<P>
   ''The overall report is one of slow, but steady progress,'' said
Karl Wagener, executive director of the council.
</P>
<P>
   Despite more downward trends than usual, the individual problems
are not indicative of a larger concern, said Wagener.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not particularly worrisome,'' he said. ''Each one seems
to have its unique reason for going down.''
</P>
<P>
   Several factors are to blame for the loss of farmland, Wagener
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The underlying reason is that very few crops pay as well as
housing developments,'' he said. ''It's economics. There's no part
of the state that is free from development pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   While farmland loss has been steady at the rate of 2 percent for
at least 10 years, the state acquired rights to three farms in
1999, Wagener said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The state has a good program for preserving farmland, but it
needs to be invigorated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A telephone message seeking comment was left Monday at the
Department of Agriculture's Farmland Protection Program office.
</P>
<P>
   The report recommends that the Department of Environmental
Protection work aggressively to reduce mercury emissions by 50
percent within five years and by 100 percent within 10 years. It
also advises the DEP and the Department of Public Health to do more
to inform the public about mercury and other contaminants in fish
and other seafood.
</P>
<P>
   ''Connecticut happens to be one of the leaders of controlling
mercury in the region and even in the U.S.,'' said Rocque. ''So
what does that mean? Mercury is contaminating everything ... We're
attempting to eliminate mercury from all sources, but Connecticut
can't solve the problem alone.''
</P>
<P>
   The council said the General Assembly should join other
northeastern states in adopting a law banning the gasoline additive
MTBE, which has been found in some well water.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other concerns is that fewer spawning shad are
returning to the Connecticut River-- a problem which not unique to
the state, Wagener said.
</P>
<P>
   The report also shows that residents want the state to conserve
more open space, do more to protect rivers and wetlands and improve
drinking water. The council heard residents' concerns during forums
in Middlefield and Putnam last year.

<HEADLINE> Miami Cuban Exiles Call For Strike  </HEADLINE>
By ALEX VEIGA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Days after the Little Havana neighborhood erupted
in violence after the seizure of Elian Gonzalez, protesters
threatened a peaceful strike that would leave Miami a ''dead
city.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of businesses pledged to shut their doors today, and many
workers said they would stay home. Protest organizers urged parents
to keep children home from school.
</P>
<P>
   But officials with the Miami airport, the Port of Miami, law
enforcement, schools and several banks said operations would
continue as normal, though they acknowledged nonessential workers
may take personal days. Many non-Cuban businesses also said they
expected no interruptions.
</P>
<P>
   The threatened strike left Miami Mayor Joe Carollo and
Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penelas walking a fine line. Both had vocally
supported months of protests and criticized the federal
government's handling of the case. But they tiptoed around
condoning a shutdown of the city, while ensuring all services will
continue.
</P>
<P>
   ''People need to vent, people are very emotional, they feel very
strongly about what happened and they want to express themselves,''
Penelas said, calling the strike a ''show of maturity'' because it
would make a peaceful statement.
</P>
<P>
   Penelas said he wanted to focus on healing. ''We have strong
divisions over the subject of Elian, but it is important that
despite these divisions the community continue to progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Carollo did not return phone calls Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Many businesses, especially in Little Havana, announced they
would join the strike. Cuban-Americans are the largest ethnic group
in Miami-Dade County, with 800,000 residents -- the nation's largest
Cuban population.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is in solidarity,'' said Rudy Quant, public relations
director of Goya Foods. The Hispanic food distributor's 150
employees and 40 trucks in Miami would stay put, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacies, groceries and furniture stores were among the
businesses that promised to close their doors. So did Estefan
Enterprises Inc., which includes two restaurants and a recording
studio owned by singer Gloria Estefan and her husband Emilio.
</P>
<P>
   Four Florida Marlins baseball players and several coaches said
they plan to miss tonight's game in San Francisco to honor the
protest. Marlins manager John Boles said they would be excused with
pay for the day.
</P>
<P>
   While many non-Cuban businesses said they expected no
interruptions in service, several workers in Little Havana and
demonstrators outside the Gonzalez house said that much of the city
would not be spared from the effects of the protest.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to look like a ghost town,'' said Antonio Pazos,
45, a warehouse clerk who said he would go to work.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the El Paisa Cafeteria, a few blocks from the
Gonzalez home, said he felt pressured to go along with the strike
but would stay open.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am Hispanic, but that doesn't mean I have to agree,'' said
the owner, who said he was Nicaraguan but would not give his full
name. ''I have to pay my rent, I have to pay my bills.''

<HEADLINE> Mediators Hope To Salvage Deal  </HEADLINE>
By RACHEL LA CORTE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) -- The negotiators who tried -- and failed
-- to broker a last-minute deal between Elian Gonzalez's Miami
relatives and the government still want to salvage a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The four leaders from Miami -- a lawyer, two businessmen and a
university president -- explained on Monday their efforts, what went
wrong and what they hope can still go right in the saga of
6-year-old Elian.
</P>
<P>
   ''We turn now to making the best of an extremely difficult
situation,'' said Edward T. Foote II, president of the University
of Miami. ''It is time to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Their hope was that Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, and
the boy's Miami relatives could reach an agreement to live together
for a week in a neutral spot in Washington. ''That would help the
family members get together and do what is in the best interest of
the child,'' Foote said.
</P>
<P>
   Their compromise would also have two psychiatrists evaluate
Elian and advise U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno. Reno was
considering the suggestion, they said.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department spokeswoman did not return a call Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Foote, the mediation team included: Carlos de la
Cruz, president of Eagle Brands snack foods who helped resolve a
black tourism boycott of Miami in 1995; Carlos Saladrigas,
president of ADP Totalsource employment service; and attorney Aaron
Podhurst, a 30-year friend of Reno who has ties to the
Cuban-American community.
</P>
<P>
   The mediators said that a deal could have been reached if the
federal government just given them more time. They called the
federal raid on the house a disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ''From our different perspectives, all of us believed strongly,
and still do, that the negotiations were proceeding. They had not
broken down,'' Foote said. ''People were acting in good faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials on Monday maintained that the raid was the
fault of the Miami relatives' refusal to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   Foote and the other mediators began to help broker a deal last
Thursday. The Miami relatives had agreed in principle to a one-page
agreement that would have the relatives, the boy and his father,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez, living in a compound in Florida, they said.
</P>
<P>
   According to mediators, the Miami relatives also had offered a
crucial concession, one they had refused many times before and that
the mediators hoped would make this deal different: The father
would get temporary custody of Elian.
</P>
<P>
   But at 4 a.m. Saturday, Reno rejected Florida as a location,
though she had agreed to it earlier, Podhurst said. ''I don't know
what was occurring at her end,'' he had said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at 4:21 a.m., Reno gave him five minutes to reach an
agreement. Podhurst said he never believed agents were waiting; he
said he thought if they missed the deadline that negotiations would
continue later. But he knew he needed to relay to the family a
possible deal-breaker.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a mediator I told them you cannot ignore the attorney
general of the United States,'' he said. ''If she says Washington,
it's Washington. If you don't do it these negotiations are over and
I'm gone.''
</P>
<P>
   They woke Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's great-uncle, but he needed
more time for the explanation before accepting.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can firmly say he would've done it,'' de la Cruz said.
</P>
<P>
   While Podhurst waited on the phone, the raid began. Podhurst
said that if the raid had been called back, they would have
successfully completed the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''We ran out of time is what happened,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> American Vets Return to Vietnam  </HEADLINE>
By TINI TRAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) -- The first time Christos Cotsakos came to
Vietnam, he was armed with the weapons for war. A quarter-century
later, he is back, bearing the tools for peace: education training
and information technology.
</P>
<P>
   It's an irony that he relishes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Coming back has allowed me to take an experience that was so
destructive and make something constructive out of it,'' said
Cotsakos, a decorated Vietnam War veteran and now chief executive
officer of E Trade Group Inc., an Internet brokerage firm that has
seen revenues soar in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Returning here feels like it's a pilgrimage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cotsakos is part of a delegation of prominent American
businessmen who served in Vietnam, and returned Monday in advance
of the 25th anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War, which falls
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, a Vietnam vet and former presidential
candidate, arrived Tuesday morning for a private visit, during
which he joined a repatriation ceremony for six sets of remains
thought to be those of Americans missing in action from the war.
The remains were put on a gray C-17 cargo plane to be flown to
Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii for forensic analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The remains were recovered earlier this year as part of the
ongoing American effort to account for the more than 2,000
servicemen still missing in Indochina from the war, including 1,500
in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure it's not possible to find all who are still missing
... I think there's going to come a time when we're going to have
to say we've exhausted all possibilities,'' McCain said, adding,
however, that efforts should continue.
</P>
<P>
   During his three-day stay in Hanoi, the former Navy fighter
pilot will visit a museum made out of the only remaining part of
the ''Hanoi Hilton,'' the prison where he was held for 5{ years
after being shot down on a mission.
</P>
<P>
   McCain will also meet a second time with the Vietnamese civilian
who pulled him out of a lake into which he parachuted as his plane
went down. The Arizona senator will then go to Ho Chi Minh City,
the former Saigon.
</P>
<P>
   The business leaders plan to share their expertise with an
impoverished country trying to integrate into the global economy.
Members promise to provide economic advice, educational resources
and other tools to the government and business leaders they meet.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are folks who wanted to come back and do something
positive and forward-looking for the country and people of
Vietnam,'' said Jan Scruggs, president of the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial Fund, and the organizer of the trip. ''Nobody wanted to do
just a nostalgia thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The delegation includes James Kimsey, founding chief executive
of America Online; Herbert Allison, former president of Merrill
Lynch in New York; and Marshall Carter, chief executive officer of
mutual fund company State Street Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very emotional for all of us to be able to bring our
experiences in war and our experiences in business to Vietnam and
make the two connect in a worthwhile way,'' said Cotsakos.
</P>
<P>
   The group was given a red-carpet welcome at Hanoi's Noi Bai
Airport, with gifts of flowers by girls in ao dais, Vietnam's
traditional flowing tunic over trousers.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're in the unique position of working for friendship and
cooperation between Vietnam and the U.S.,'' Vu Xuan Hong of the
Vietnamese Friendship Society told them. ''When veterans sit down
together, how can others not follow their example? So I ask you to
lend a helping hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The weeklong trip includes speaking engagements at universities,
meetings with business and government leaders as well as the
dedication of a computer lab Tuesday to the Hanoi University of
Foreign Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Cotsakos, whose company is based in Palo Alto, Calif., will
spend Tuesday introducing a locally produced television series on
the Fundamentals of Market Economics and hosting a forum with
Vietnamese business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Cotsakos, 51, credits his time in Vietnam with providing him
with the drive to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are character defining moments in everyone's life.
Vietnam taught me about leadership, survival, trust, honor and
resiliency,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A self-described ''restless 18-year-old hoodlum'' from New
Jersey, Cotsakos volunteered for military service in 1967. He was
wounded in central Vietnam after serving four months in the 101st
Airborne, receiving a Purple Heart and Bronze Star for Valor -- and
a sense of his purpose in life.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was an inner generator that came from the war that
pushed me. There was so much destruction, you wanted to do
something constructive. If someone told me it was impossible, I
would find a way to make it possible. That's how I survived in
Vietnam.''

<HEADLINE> Lawyers make closing arguments; porn star still absent  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A Wall Street executive accused of feeding
secret stock tips to an X-rated actress to win her affection ''was
a rocket scientist on bank stocks,'' his lawyer told a jury during
closing arguments.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Denis McInerney, was trying to explain how his
client, James McDermott Jr., managed to recommend six stocks to
Kathryn Gannon that later ended up on a list of merger-related
stocks forbidden to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   The argument came Monday in a two-week-old trial in U.S.
District Court in Manhattan. At the center of the case is
McDermott, the former chief executive officer at Keefe, Bruyette &AMP;
Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors allege McDermott, of Briarcliff Manor, violated a
promise not to discuss stocks about to be affected by mergers or
acquisitions when he suggested them to Gannon as he carried on an
extramarital affair with her.
</P>
<P>
   Gannon, who used the name Marylin Star in porn features
including ''Fantasies of Marylin,'' ''Pumped,'' ''S.M.U.T. 4'' and
''More Dirty Debutantes 30,'' remains a fugitive in the case, which
has left McDermott on trial with Anthony Pomponio. Pomponio, a
businessman, also is alleged to have had an affair with Gannon and
to have bought stocks based on McDermott's secrets.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott, formerly a $4 million-a-year executive, Pomponio, 45,
of North Caldwell, N.J., and Gannon, 30, who has a home in Miami,
Fla., are each charged with conspiracy and securities fraud.
Prosecutors allege the trio made more than $170,000 in illegal
profits.
</P>
<P>
   McInerney, the lawyer, said the recommendations were made during
1987 and 1988, when it ''was bank stock heaven,'' a period after
government deregulation when bank stocks rose dramatically as many
banks merged.
</P>
<P>
   ''If ever there was a rocket scientist on bank stocks, it's Mr.
McDermott,'' McInerney said. ''Mr. McDermott knew what he was
talking about, more than anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the expert knowledge landed him television interviews
''all the time'' and said it was no coincidence that many stocks he
recommended later ended up involved in mergers and on lists
requiring secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be stunning if that didn't happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McInerney told jurors that his 48-year-old client has never
wavered in his insistence that the extramarital affair never
involved the trading of secrets about stocks of companies involved
in mergers or acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't do anything wrong. I did not engage in insider
trading. I did not break the law,'' McInerney said his client has
contended for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors have been told that Gannon is a model, an actress and a
dancer but have been spared more salacious details of her porn
career.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said McDermott wanted to flash his stock-picking
prowess to impress Gannon, then the 28-year-old star ''Shades of
Blonde'' and ''Sins of the Flesh.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney James Benjamin said McDermott gave
Gannon tips on six stocks of companies that he knew were about to
merge.
</P>
<P>
   ''He did this to further his relationship with Kathryn Gannon,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He then cautioned the jury that ''nobody is accusing McDermott
or Pomponio of committing a crime because they had an extramarital
relationship with Kathryn Gannon.''
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin said McDermott recommended six stocks, five of which he
had never mentioned during hundreds of television interviews or
public appearances.
</P>
<P>
   He said the three defendants engaged in conspiracy when they
agreed ''to tamper with the integrity of the stock market through
insider trading.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States is seeking the extradition of Gannon from her
Canadian home.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Dunn, a lawyer for Pomponio, said his client was
innocent, having told the Securities and Exchange Commission
everything he knew about his trades and how they originated.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Military Wastes Worries Japan  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH COLEMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   YOKOHAMA, Japan (AP) -- On a U.S. Army dock south of Tokyo lies
the latest irritant between the American military and its Japanese
hosts: 100 tons of toxic waste.
</P>
<P>
   The PCB-laden garbage, including transformers, circuit breakers,
oil and other debris, was generated by U.S. bases in Japan and
shipped out in late March to a recycling plant in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Now the waste is back -- and many Japanese aren't happy about it.
</P>
<P>
   The shipment was refused by Canada and dockworkers in Seattle,
and was met with demonstrations when it arrived in Yokohama on
April 18. The waste led to daylong TV news broadcasts and political
protests.
</P>
<P>
   The refuse will be stored in Japan for up to a month and then
shipped elsewhere. But the hoopla underscored the enduring public
unease here over the environmental impact of playing host to the
American military.
</P>
<P>
   ''Environmental pollution linked to U.S. bases has always been a
problem,'' said Mizuho Fukushima, an upper house lawmaker from the
Social Democratic Party, which sent a protest letter to the Foreign
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military faces allegations of fouling the soil, air and
water around bases. Lawsuits accuse bases of noise pollution.
Critics say a planned U.S. helicopter base in Okinawa could
threaten coral reefs.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. military fiercely denies it is a polluter.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not treat our facilities with abandon. We live, we work,
we train inside these facilities,'' said Lt. Col. Billy Birdwell,
spokesman for U.S. Forces, Japan. ''We treat the environment inside
those places with great respect.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials also say they've been careful with the shipment
that came back. It is contaminated with PCBs, or polychlorinated
biphenyls, which have been linked to cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The American Embassy insists the shipment will not be in Japan
for more than a month and does not pose a threat to the
environment. Besides, officials say, the items were produced in
Japan in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The shipment, however, has been a major headache for the U.S.
Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
   The waste was shipped out of Japan on March 23 to make room at a
crowded U.S. military storage area outside Tokyo. The original
destination was a recycling center in Canada, but entry was denied
by the Canadian government.
</P>
<P>
   Then the freighter headed to Seattle for temporary storage. When
dockworkers refused to unload the waste, the load headed back to
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In Yokohama, dozens of protesters gathered on the dock to
denounce the shipment, and several demonstrators from Greenpeace
boarded the ship and blocked unloading for several hours.
</P>
<P>
   Now the 14 containers of garbage sit at the U.S. Army's North
Dock warehouse facility. Military officials say they have been open
about the shipment, but no details about what is next have been
released. U.S. officials say only that the final destination has
not been determined.
</P>
<P>
   The mess follows closely on the heels of another environmental
tiff between the U.S. military and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit in Japanese courts
in March demanding the closure of an incinerator near a U.S. Navy
air facility in Atsugi, south of Tokyo. U.S. military officials
accuse the incinerator of spewing cancer-causing dioxin over the
base.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese government has said little on the waste shipment.
Foreign Minister Yohei Kono was quoted in local media reports as
saying he asked that the waste stay in Japan no longer than a
month, and U.S. officials agreed.
</P>
<P>
   The issue highlights a quandary for the U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
   Importation of foreign-made PCBs is banned in the United States,
and there are no facilities for disposing of the toxic materials in
Japan, meaning the military either has to store them indefinitely
or search for a third country willing to dispose of them.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling public suspicions has been the secrecy under which the
U.S. military operates in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Under agreements with Japan, the U.S. military has no obligation
to publicly disclose information about on-base hazardous materials.
And it does not have to clean up environmental messes on bases when
they are handed back to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ''The U.S. military hardly discloses any information about
environmental problems,'' said Fukushima, the lawmaker. ''And they
didn't in this case, either.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Africa's Malaria Higher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Africa's economy might be up to $100 billion
richer today if malaria had been conquered three decades ago, but
instead this devastating disease is one reason many African nations
remain trapped in poverty, says a study from Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   The study, to be presented to African leaders gathering in
Nigeria on Tuesday for an unprecedented summit on malaria, finds
the burden of this killer parasite to be far higher than previously
estimated.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's absolutely shocking,'' said study author Jeffrey Sachs,
director of Harvard's Center for International Development.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to causing immense suffering and death, malaria
slows economic development by about 1.3 percent a year, the study
found. That effect is compounded over time -- meaning the longer
malaria plagues a country, the farther it falls behind similar but
malaria-free nations.
</P>
<P>
   It will take an annual investment of $1 billion by the world's
richest countries to significantly attack malaria, Sachs concluded.
The share for the United States would cost just 75 cents per
American per year, he said in a telephone briefing for U.S.
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the world spends only about $120 million against malaria,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Malaria is one of the world's worst scourges. Drugs and
insecticides have made it rare in developed countries, but in
tropical, developing nations, it sickens 300 million to 500 million
people every year and kills at least 1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sub-Saharan Africa is hardest hit; children are most vulnerable;
and malaria is fast evolving to resist medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The World Health Organization aims to cut malaria deaths in half
by 2010, through its ''Rollback Malaria'' campaign unveiled in
1998. One chief strategy is bed nets treated with mosquito-killing
insecticide, a cheap and proven way to prevent malaria. Yet only 2
percent of African children sleep under a bed net, says the WHO,
which helped organization Tuesday's malaria summit in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   To estimate the economic effect, Sachs added to malaria's
medical costs other factors: missed schooling, neurologic damage to
children, lost productivity, lack of investment by foreign
corporations, lower tourism. After accounting for the effects of
economic policy and other factors that influence growth, he
concluded the slow-down of economic development by 1.3 percent per
year, an effect compounded with passing time.

<HEADLINE> NRA video on gun safety criticized by gun control advocates  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A city police officer was wrong to show
schoolchildren a National Rifle Association cartoon video aimed at
teaching children about gun safety, gun control advocates charge.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the NRA has blood on its hands,'' city Public Advocate
Mark Green said Monday. ''I think they are morally and legally
responsible for thousands of deaths a year, in a sense, in our city
and our country, and they should not be anywhere near our kids
talking about guns.''
</P>
<P>
   The NRA video was from the ''Eddie Eagle GunSafe Program.'' The
central character is a cartoon eagle wearing high tops who swoops
down on children when he sees them stumble upon a handgun. Raising
his wings, Eddie squawks: ''STOP! Don't touch! Leave the area! Tell
an adult!''
</P>
<P>
   The program does not promote firearm ownership or use, NRA
spokesman John Robbins said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's purely about gun safety and keeping kids safe,'' Robbins
said.
</P>
<P>
   But State Sen. Eric Schneiderman, a gun control advocate,
disagreed and called Eddie Eagle ''Joe Camel with feathers,'' a
reference to the cartoon camel featured in cigarette advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins, the NRA spokesman, said that the program is taught by
law enforcement officers and elementary school teachers and that 24
governors have passed resolutions recommending it be taught in
their states.
</P>
<P>
   In December, a plan to introduce Eddie Eagle into New York
state's elementary schools was vetoed by Gov. George Pataki. But in
late March, a New York Police Department youth officer showed the
video to several fourth-grade classes at Public School 217, in
Ditmas Park, Brooklyn. The video apparently was not shown anywhere
else.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir said he did not know how the
officer obtained the video, but it was not sanctioned by the
department. The officer, however, will not be disciplined.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said that although he disagrees with the NRA, Eddie Eagle
has a good message.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the officer saw a film he thought he could use as a
training tool to save young people's lives, which is if you see a
gun, don't touch the gun, call an adult. That's a good message,''
Safir said. ''We have too many guns in this country. The NRA is
absolutely wrong advocating the proliferation of guns. I'm against
that and the NRA's position on it. But I'm certainly not against
gun safety, and I'm certainly not against protecting young
people.''
</P>
<P>
   School officials did not return a telephone call for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Safir criticized Green, the public advocate, for attacking the
messenger, not the message.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mark Green is attacking the NYPD as he always does because
he's a cop basher, but he's missing the message, which is if you
see a gun and you're young, don't touch it,'' Safir said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the NRA, Eddie Eagle is taught to pre-kindergarten
through sixth-grade children ''to avoid gun accidents.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Just as Smokey Bear teaches children not to play with matches,
Eddie Eagle teaches them that firearms are not toys and should not
be touched without adult supervision,'' the NRA said on its Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1988, Eddie Eagle has reached more than 12 million
children in all 50 states, Canada and Puerto Rico, the NRA said.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Police Raid Daewoo Plant  </HEADLINE>
By JAE-SUK YOO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Police stormed the main plant of an
ailing auto firm west of Seoul before dawn Tuesday and arrested 20
militant labor activists. All but seven were later released.
</P>
<P>
   The raid at Daewoo Motor Co.'s plant followed more than two
months of partial or full-scale strikes by the plant's 10,000
workers to protest the planned sale of the firm to a foreign
investor. The government said the strikes were illegal.
</P>
<P>
   There were no violent clashes during the 30-minute raid because
most striking workers were at home, police said.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 riot police broke into the company's main labor union
office inside the plant at Bupyong, 20 miles west of Seoul, and
arrested 20 leaders and workers.
</P>
<P>
   Among those remaining in detention was Chu Young-ho, the union's
top leader and organizer of the strike.
</P>
<P>
   About 3,000 workers gathered at the plant later and vowed to
continue the strike, which began on Feb. 15. They fear mass layoffs
under foreign ownership, and have demanded that their firm be
nationalized and run by the government.
</P>
<P>
   The strike affected only Daewoo's main plant in Bupyong with an
annual capacity of 500,000 cars. A second Daewoo plant on the
nation's central west coast with an annual capacity of 300,000 cars
stayed open.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials worried that the prolonged Daewoo strike
would negatively impact a planned sale of another ailing auto firm,
Samsung Motors Inc., to French carmaker Renault SA.
</P>
<P>
   Samsung's 16 creditor banks met in Seoul on Tuesday and approved
a tentative deal negotiated last weekend to sell the troubled South
Korean firm to Renault.
</P>
<P>
   Five potential buyers -- General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co.,
DaimlerChrysler AG, Fiat SpA and Hyundai Motor Co. -- are taking
part in international bidding for Daewoo. The successful bidder
will be selected by September.
</P>
<P>
   Unionized workers of the nation's two other auto firms -- Hyundai
and Kia -- staged a one-week strike early this month in support of
Daewoo workers.
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai and Kia workers also fear mass layoffs. They argue that
if Daewoo is sold to a foreign investor, it would intensify
competition and encroach upon their market.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo Motor is a unit of Daewoo Group, which collapsed under
huge debts last year. It began as a joint venture with GM in 1978.
GM sold its 50 percent stake to Daewoo for $70 million in 1992.

   BEIJING (AP) -- Falun Gong followers by the dozens unfurled banners and sat
silently in Tiananmen Square Tuesday, prompting swift arrest from police, as the
spiritual group marked the first anniversary of a mass protest that provoked a
Chinese government ban. Police detained at least 95 people in and around the
square Tuesday morning. The vast plaza in Beijing's center seemed a swirl of
chaos with small-scale protests erupting in all directions. Officers sometimes
reacted violently, even though they were expecting the anniversary protests. One
officer punched a man in the face as he and three others tried to raise a

gang related and sought at least one teen-age gunman who fired a handgun into
groups of youths after a confrontation escalated to bottle throwing and then

company's future. Attorneys for the Justice Department and the 19 states that
successfully sued Microsoft for antitrust violations are considering ways to

is conducting interviews and has issued a subpoena to find out whether
administration officials tried to obstruct investigators by not turning over
e-mails. The move immerses Ray deeper into the most recent Clinton
administration controversy at a time when the independent's office is trying to
finish its six-year investigation -- and decide whether the president should be
indicted when he leaves office.

<HEADLINE> Saigon Palace Raid Recalled  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL ALEXANDER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam (AP) -- The directions sounded simple --
cross the bridge, go left at the first traffic circle and left
again at the seventh intersection.
</P>
<P>
   But getting to the Presidential Palace in Saigon proved to be a
deadly challenge for the crew of tank No. 390. They had to fight
their way against the desperate last resistance of the U.S.-backed
South Vietnamese army on April 30, 1975 -- the day the Vietnam War
ended.
</P>
<P>
   The four men in the Chinese-made T-59 tank had been together
since 1972 and were part of the spring push by communist forces
that swept rapidly south from the central highlands toward their
final goal: Saigon.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fighting along the road down south was very fierce,'' tank
driver Nguyen Van Tap recalled from his home in Hoang Dieu village,
outside Hanoi. ''But our spirits were very high. We thought the end
was very near.''
</P>
<P>
   All were from rural areas and had never been to the South
Vietnamese capital. Only one map of the city had been smuggled out.
So when North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces massed 30 miles away,
the directions were passed out, along with red armbands as a sign
of determination.
</P>
<P>
   There was too much work to sleep. At around 5 a.m., a column of
tanks set out as a hot, sunny day was dawning.
</P>
<P>
   ''Along the way, I saw many vehicles loaded with people fleeing
Saigon in the opposite direction and we ran into very little
resistance until we got to the Saigon bridge between 8:30 a.m. and
9 a.m.,'' Tap said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was very chaotic. On the north end of the bridge, some of
our tanks were burning. Three aircraft were trying to drop bombs to
destroy the bridge to keep us from crossing, but our machine guns
kept them away.''
</P>
<P>
   A boat also was firing from the river. The constant barrage
killed many communist soldiers, including the tank regiment
commander. Blockades had been placed on the Y-shaped bridge and an
American-built M-48 tank ensconced at the other end knocked out
several advancing tanks before it, too, was disabled.
</P>
<P>
   ''It took us almost 1{ hours to cross the bridge,'' Tap said.
''I don't know which of us destroyed the M-48.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a brief skirmish on the other side, tank 390 became
lost. A teen-ager carrying a suitcase pointed them in the right
direction, and they finally spotted the palace.
</P>
<P>
   Another tank, a Russian-made T-54 marked No. 483, already was
there. Its chief, Bui Quang Than, said his crew loaded one of its
two remaining 100mm shells and tried twice to fire it at the
palace, but the gun misfired.
</P>
<P>
   Although No. 483 initially was credited with crashing through
the gates, it was stuck in a narrow space and No. 390's crew
decided to batter through.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't take the paved road because it might be mined. So we
went over the lawn,'' Tap said. ''I saw some armored cars and tanks
in the courtyard and South Vietnamese soldiers running away.''
</P>
<P>
   Than grabbed a Viet Cong flag -- one they'd been given during the
drive south -- and, with three of his men armed with machine guns,
jumped from No. 483 and ran inside the palace, instructing his
gunner that if he didn't see the flag flying in a few minutes, he
should fire the final shell.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought I was going to be killed,'' Than said. ''I didn't
even know the way to the flagpole.''
</P>
<P>
   On the second floor, he saw the South Vietnamese Cabinet sitting
in a room and he started to run in but smacked into a glass wall.
</P>
<P>
   ''Luckily, I was wearing my helmet, so it didn't hurt much,''
Than said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   He was met by a South Vietnamese official who took him to meet
President Duong Van Minh, in office only a few days after his
predecessor, Nguyen Van Thieu, fled.
</P>
<P>
   ''He ordered the other man to show me the way to the flagpole,''
Than said. ''The guy took me to an elevator, but I never had seen
one before, and I stood there when the door opened, afraid to go in
because it might be a trap. It looked like a cell. I made him go in
first.''
</P>
<P>
   He found himself on the palace terrace where the yellow-and-red
South Vietnamese flag still fluttered in a light breeze.
</P>
<P>
   ''The South Vietnamese flag was very big. I could only manage to
untie two knots, so I just tore it down and hoisted the liberation
flag. I intended to throw the old flag into the courtyard, but it
was made of very good material, so I folded it up and put it in a
box to use it as a blanket.''
</P>
<P>
   Communist troops began firing in the air in celebration, and
people who had been hiding during the final assault began coming
out into the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ''At first, they were suspicious because the South Vietnamese
government told them that once the Viet Cong came into the city, we
would kill all of the people,'' Than said.
</P>
<P>
   After the two tanks were assigned to go that night to the nearby
Long Binh base, officials came looking for the flag, and he gave it
up.
</P>
<P>
   There was a little compensation for the heroic crew. They had
their first big meal in a long time: beef and chicken donated by
local residents. Tap said they also found some beer and liquor at
the port.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very hard to describe our feelings,'' he said. ''First,
we were overjoyed with our victory. But we also were just happy to
survive the war.''

<HEADLINE> High Court Hears Abortion Argument  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The legal, moral and political war over
abortion is back in the Supreme Court after an eight-year absence.
The justices are trying to decide whether states may ban a surgical
procedure opponents call ''partial birth abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   After hearing arguments today, the nation's highest court will
decide by late June whether Nebraska can make it a crime for
doctors to perform such abortions. Thirty states have similar laws.
</P>
<P>
   The court has not issued a major abortion ruling since 1992,
when it reaffirmed the core holding of its 1973 Roe vs. Wade
decision. That landmark decision said women have a constitutional
right to end their pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is asking the court to strike down
Nebraska's law. The president twice vetoed similar federal bans
enacted by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In this year's presidential race, Democrat Al Gore opposes bans
on partial birth abortion, but Republican George W. Bush supports
them.
</P>
<P>
   Although the legal controversy swirls around a specific
procedure, far more may be at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ''This law prohibits an array of safe and common abortion
procedures used throughout pregnancy,'' said Catherine Weiss,
director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Reproductive
Freedom Project. ''Effectively, it is a ban on abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Clarke Forsythe, president of Americans United for Life, said
the court's eventual decision ''will have widespread legal,
legislative and medical implications for infant rights.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Partial-birth abortion breaches the wall between abortion and
infanticide,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Partial-birth abortion is not a medical term. Doctors call the
method dilation and extraction, or D&AMP;X, because it involves
partially extracting a fetus, legs first, through the birth canal,
cutting the skull and draining its contents.
</P>
<P>
   In unanimously striking down the Nebraska law, the 8th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals said the law's wording could also outlaw a
more common procedure called dilation and evacuation, or D&AMP;E.
</P>
<P>
   A month after the Nebraska law was struck down, along with those
in Iowa and Arkansas, nearly identical abortion laws in Illinois
and Wisconsin were upheld by another federal appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   Leroy Carhart, one of only three doctors known in Nebraska to
perform abortions, challenged the state's law, which he told
reporters Monday is aimed at ''taking away the rights of American
women to have abortions.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is Stenberg vs. Carhart, 99-830.

<HEADLINE> Clintons and Gore together at first fund-raiser of year  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- President Clinton delivered his most emotional
endorsement yet for Vice President Al Gore, and applauded his
Senate-candidate wife in the first joint fund-raising appearance of
the year for the president and the two politicians whose careers he
has helped coach.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gore, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, and
Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Democratic candidate for Senate in New
York, initially kept their political distance from Clinton as their
campaigns began in earnest earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no sign of distance at a packed Democratic
National Committee fund-raising party Monday night, as Clinton
locked Gore in a bear hug and exchanged smiles and whispers with
his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very proud of the record of this administration, and the
results speak for themselves,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton returned the compliment with a reference to the
evening's musical entertainment, and a plug for continuation of the
economic policies he said have set the country on a path of
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ''The theme song of this election year ought to be the first
song Tony Bennett sang tonight, 'The Best is Yet to Come,'''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will seize the president's economic coattails anew in a
compare-and-contrast strategy he plans to roll out against Texas
Gov. George W. Bush in a speech today to the Association for a
Better New York.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the presumptive Republican nominee has detailed his
agenda for education, health care, housing, the economy and
environment, Gore plans to pick it apart, casting himself as the
more responsible and experienced steward.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman said Bush, by contrast, planned to speak in Dayton,
Ohio, on Tuesday and Wednesday at a Republican National Committee
fund-raiser about his interests in working with Democrats. He was
bringing Texas Democratic lawmakers with him to Ohio, campaign
spokesman Ari Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton grinned with pride as Hillary Rodham Clinton spoke with
uncustomary ease and delivered a few one-liners on Monday night.
After she introduced him, Clinton joked to the crowd, ''I think
she's about to get the hang of it, don't you?''
</P>
<P>
   The president's tone turned melancholy as he reflected on his
more than seven years in office with Gore, and he brought a hush to
the partisan crowd as he rhetorically passed the torch.
</P>
<P>
   ''I probably know more about him than anybody but Tipper. I know
what he likes and can't stand. I know what he loves. I know when
he's having a bad day and how he deals with it ... and all I can
say is I feel absolutely comfortable putting the future of my
daughter, and the grandchildren I hope she'll give us, in his
hands.''
</P>
<P>
   In a break with protocol, ''Hail to the Chief'' did not play as
Clinton entered the room for the $2.2 million Democratic gala, and
Gore, not Clinton, got headliner's honors as the last to speak
</P>
<P>
   Gore gave the more combative speech.
</P>
<P>
   He accused Republicans of ''fraud'' and ''illusion'' in their
education, tax and defense policies, and said GOP spending
priorities do not add up.
</P>
<P>
   ''How arrogant to think that we Americans cannot add or
subtract,'' Gore said.

<HEADLINE> Feds To Remove Vieques Protesters  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal authorities are nearing completion of
a plan to remove dozens of protesters from a U.S. Navy bombing
range in Puerto Rico, by force if necessary, government officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The removal operation could begin as early as next week, the
officials said Monday, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of the protesters stands in the way of fully
implementing a Jan. 31 agreement between President Clinton and
Puerto Rican Gov. Pedro Rossello to permit the Navy to resume
limited training exercises on the island of Vieques in exchange for
a referendum on whether to eventually close the range.
</P>
<P>
   At the time the deal was announced, Rossello publicly pledged to
''support federal efforts to assure that trespassing or other
intrusions on the range cease entirely.'' Since the Jan. 31
agreement, however, no action has been taken against the protesters
and the Navy has been unable to resume exercises.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday in Puerto Rico, protesters promised no armed
resistance, but they have vowed to replace any arrested
demonstrators by cutting fences, sending in reinforcements by
horseback or dispatching dozens of small boats to break any
blockade.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters will not resist arrest, said Manuel Rodriguez
Orellana, North American Affairs secretary for the Puerto Rican
Independence Party, which has maintained a camp in the bombing
range since May.
</P>
<P>
   The removal plan, which has not received the final go-ahead,
would be directed by the Justice Department and involve federal
marshals as well as FBI agents. Marines would be aboard ships off
the coast to provide perimeter security, the officials said. Puerto
Rican police would support the operation by performing crowd
control and other duties.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Bacon, chief spokesman for Defense Secretary William
Cohen, referred questions to the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is nothing we can say about if and when'' the FBI plans
to try to remove the protesters, FBI spokesman Bill Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   Navy officials would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether any of the protesters possess or have
access to weapons, but some have vowed to make federal agents force
them off the property, which has been used as a bombing range for
decades. It has been a premier training ground for Navy and Marine
Corps aircraft and ships since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Romero Barcelo, Puerto Rico's nonvoting delegate to
Congress, said in an interview Monday that he supports a move to
clear the bombing range of protesters, although he was not aware of
a specific plan. But he said he was aware of credible information
that some protesters on Vieques may be armed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope that the protesters will fulfill their promises that
... they have no intention whatsoever of creating a violent
confrontation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of a violent confrontation on Vieques is especially
sensitive in light of the show of force used by federal agents last
Saturday in removing 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez from the home of his
Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters numbering from a few dozen to several dozen have
camped on various parts of Vieques since April 19, 1999 when errant
bombs from a Marine Corps jet killed a civilian Puerto Rican guard.
That incident caused the Navy to suspend training, and months of
negotiations ensued between Puerto Rico, the Navy and the White
House over when and under what condition the Navy would resume
bombing practice.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters occupy several camps on the range. Their numbers can
reach into the dozens depending on weather conditions. Last
Wednesday they marked the first anniversary of the accidental
killing of civilian security guard David Sanes Rodriguez. Mourners
laid flowers on his grave and demanded the Navy's eviction.
</P>
<P>
   There has been little indication from interviews with protesters
then that they fear being arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Aponte, a university professor who said he joins the
protesters on holidays, said last week, ''I will believe in the
arrests when the helicopter lands and the federal marshals come
out.''

<HEADLINE> 'Millionaire' Draws First Black  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It took 84 shows before a black contestant had a
chance to go after the big prize on ''Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Maurice Clark left with $32,000, not a million, after
enabling television's most popular program to end an embarrassing
streak during an appearance on the show Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he defended the show from critics who complain about
the preponderance of white males.
</P>
<P>
   ''To me, it shouldn't be an issue and I think if I had been on
in November, it wouldn't have been an issue,'' said Clark, a
Harvard-educated surgeon from Aiken, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   As the months wore on, though, the lack of black contestants had
become an annoyance for the producers, who have slightly modified
the way the show selects contestants in order to minimize what are
perceived as advantages for white men.
</P>
<P>
   Only 26, or 13 percent, of the 195 people that have been in the
hot seat through the end of Sunday's show were women, according to
ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Host Regis Philbin took the unusual step on Feb. 1 of appealing
to women and minorities to dial the toll-free telephone number for
a quiz to qualify for the show. Before that date, only 12 percent
of the hot seat contestants were women; since then, it has been 17
percent, ABC said.
</P>
<P>
   Including Clark, there have been six blacks among the 855 people
who made it onto the show. Each program begins with 10 players, and
just a few get to play for a million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Some have speculated that white males are more trivia-crazy, and
young men are faster punching buttons because they play more video
games. The phone quiz potential contestants are given requires them
to quickly give answers using a push-button phone.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Davies, the show's executive producer, has said that
fewer qualifying questions are being asked on music, film and
literature since that's perceived to give trivia buffs an edge. The
qualifying process has also been changed to slightly de-emphasize
speed.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Winzenburg, a communications professor at Grand View
College in Des Moines, Iowa, said other game shows adjust their
qualification process so contestants best reflect the nation's
diversity. He said ABC should consider doing the same for
''Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   ''At some point, people are going to get tired of seeing white
men every night,'' Winzenburg said. ''I think we've reached that
point already.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clark said he believes the selection process was fair. Part
of the show's appeal is that everyone who calls in has the same
shot at being selected, regardless of gender, nationality or job,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am so sick and tired of hearing people say that minorities
can't compete, that the playing field has to be tilted so the
results can be equal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said he didn't know why more blacks weren't contestants.
He said some of his smart, accomplished friends haven't tried
because they didn't want the attention of being on national
television.
</P>
<P>
   He had to correctly answer questions about the Bible, coffee and
baseball to get on the show. He tried about 10 times before making
it.
</P>
<P>
   No mention was made of the milestone on the air Sunday night.
Clark said that he and Philbin talked about it, and he said he
believed the show had been criticized unfairly, but the
conversation was edited out.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Probe OKs IRS on Allegations  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A congressional investigation found little
evidence to support claims made in high-profile Senate hearings
about misconduct and abuse of taxpayers by Internal Revenue Service
employees, a report kept secret for almost a year says.
</P>
<P>
   ''Generally, we found no corroborating evidence that the
criminal investigations described at the hearing were retaliatory
against the specific taxpayer,'' the General Accounting Office
concluded in the report. ''We could not independently substantiate
that IRS employees had vendettas against these taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
   The findings released Monday are the latest in a series of
investigations that have failed to find widespread evidence of
problems alleged during Senate Finance Committee hearings two years
ago that helped spur wholesale changes at the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO said investigators ''did not find any evidence'' to
support claims made by IRS employees at the Senate hearings that
their superiors ordered assessments against large taxpayers to be
''zeroed out'' in order to gain personal awards, improve their own
statistics or pursue careers outside the agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our investigation established that the allegations themselves
had been based on an incomplete awareness of the total
circumstances,'' the GAO report said. ''We found that each manager
had acted within his or her discretion ... their decisions were
approved by appropriate individuals and were documented in the
files.''
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report was completed last May but was kept under wraps
because it contained confidential taxpayer information protected by
law. A version with some names and other data blacked out was
released by the IRS under the Freedom of Information Act to Tax
Notes, a journal that closely follows tax news for professionals. A
version also was released Monday to The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The Finance Committee hearings in April 1998 helped lead to the
passage later that year of an IRS reform law intended to curb
agency enforcement abuses and remake the agency into one that
treats taxpayers more like customers. While the IRS now draws
praise from Congress for its changes, the law also triggered a
sharp drop in enforcement actions such as audits and liens.
</P>
<P>
   Previous GAO audits have also found little evidence to back up
the claims made by witnesses at the hearings. A blue-ribbon panel
headed by former FBI and CIA director William Webster also
concluded last April that the IRS Criminal Investigation Division
was not guilty of ''systemic abuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del., nonetheless
believes the hearings contributed to a much-needed IRS reform law
that ''has added a lot of protections for taxpayers,'' said Roth
spokeswoman Ginny Flynn.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can protect taxpayer rights and collect the right amount
of taxes,'' Flynn said.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest probe, the GAO specifically found:
</P>
<P>
   --No evidence supporting testimony from IRS employees Ginger
Jarvis, Michael Ayala, Maureen O'Dwyer and Minh Thi Johnson that
senior managers mistreated taxpayers, forgave taxes for big
companies as favors or to improve their own status and allowed
former IRS agents who now work for private companies to influence
audits.
</P>
<P>
   Among the discounted claims were: An Atlanta manager ''covered
up'' a tax collection issue for his girlfriend and a Manhattan
manager improperly ordered a tax case closed despite an agent's
recommendation that the taxpayer pay a $42 million assessment.
</P>
<P>
   --Little corroboration for testimony from four business people
that the IRS used heavy-handed tactics in executing search
warrants, that some agents acted out of personal malice and that
some IRS actions were intended to intimidate people who represent
taxpayers before the agency.
</P>
<P>
   One of those business witnesses was John Colaprete, who operates
restaurants in Virginia Beach and Norfolk, Va. He is embroiled in a
$20 million civil lawsuit against the IRS over a raid at his
establishment, which is headed for a federal jury trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our investigation did find that decisions to initiate the
investigations were reasonably based on information available to
the IRS at the time ... We found no evidence that IRS employees
acted improperly in obtaining and executing the search warrants,''
the GAO found.

<HEADLINE> S.C. Ban on Video Gambling Gets OK  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER HOLLAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Video gambling operators have a message as
the countdown approaches toward a statewide ban of their machines:
Don't cash out on us yet.
</P>
<P>
   The $2.8 billion industry has until July 1 before it's
officially banned, but some operators plan to keep the lights on in
their machines until the last hour.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still have some hope of something happening,'' said Rhea
McCary of Fast Freddies, which owns 300 machines across the South
Carolina. ''In the past, it's always happened in the 11th hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Time and options are running out, however.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday refused to hear an appeal of
the ban that was filed by Joytime Distributors &AMP; Amusement Co., a
Greenville-based corporation that owns 164 video gambling machines
in several counties.
</P>
<P>
   ''Video poker is dead in South Carolina,'' said Sen. John Land,
D-Manning, who had led efforts last year for higher payouts for the
industry. ''It was dead when the Supreme Court ruled. Nothing is
going to revive it.''
</P>
<P>
   The South Carolina General Assembly last summer passed a law
intended to ban video gambling unless voters in a November
referendum approved continued payouts from the machines.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a month before the referendum, the state Supreme Court
struck it down, ruling that the General Assembly had violated the
state constitution by delegating its decision-making power. But the
state's highest court upheld other parts of the law, effectively
ending video gambling as of July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Joytime's appeal said the state Supreme Court ''infringed
fundamental First Amendment freedoms of the South Carolina
electorate by first enjoining the referendum on video gaming and
then itself deciding that such gaming should be outlawed.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought it was a substantial issue that at some time the
court needs to look at,'' Joytime lawyer Gaston Fairey said.
''We're disappointed that the court chose not to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney General Charlie Condon said the high court's
ruling probably won't be the last word on video gambling. ''I just
can't imagine this industry not filing another lawsuit,'' Condon
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Fairey said he has no other plans to keep the machines
operating.
</P>
<P>
   The state Revenue Department, which regulates the industry, is
waiting to see how many operators will renew their licenses when
some 20,300 expire May 31, said agency spokesman Danny Brazell.
</P>
<P>
   The law requires the department to refund fees, which cost
$1,000 per machine for six months and $4,000 for two years, for the
remainder of the licenses after June 30.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one has applied for a refund,'' Brazell said Monday. ''Some
are waiting for a last minute reprieve.''
</P>
<P>
   Economists say a strong economy should help South Carolina
absorb the 3,000 estimated jobs that will be lost with the
industry. Some video owners said they may take their machines out
of state to recoup business.
</P>
<P>
   The financial void also could be filled by Gov. Jim Hodges' push
for a state lottery to fund education initiatives. South Carolina
voters will decide in November whether to accept the lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, video gambling operators plan to keep their machines
beeping and humming as usual until July 1.
</P>
<P>
   But ''hold on because it's going to be a bumpy ride for a
while,'' McCary said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Hate Crimes Bill  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hoping to hone in on a perceived Republican
weakness, President Clinton is plotting to revive stagnant hate
crimes legislation and try to force a vote in Congress before the
November elections.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, along with Attorney General Janet Reno, was gathering
state law enforcement officials at the White House today to develop
a strategy to mobilize public support for the bill and press
Republican congressional leaders to take it up.
</P>
<P>
   While congressional Democrats denied any political motives, the
White House admitted using the hate crimes issue as a wedge to
force the GOP to back up its ''compassionate conservative''
rhetoric with action.
</P>
<P>
   ''If, politically, the Republicans feel the heat ... then that's
great, but the reality is there is not an overt political agenda
here. The message is this bill is needed,'' said Will Keyser,
spokesman for Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., who is seeking to
attach a hate crimes amendment to another bill.
</P>
<P>
   A senior White House official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Monday that Texas Gov. George Bush's ''trouble with
Bob Jones and extremist elements in the Republican Party'' were
factors in renewing the push for a hate crimes bill. The official
was referring to Bush's failure to denounce the South Carolina
university's ban on interracial dating during a speech at the
school.
</P>
<P>
   Bush apologized for not speaking out a week after winning the
South Carolina GOP primary.
</P>
<P>
   The hate crimes bill had broad support among Republican
lawmakers, the official said, and the hope is that the Republican
leadership ''will view this legislation in a new way'' if they feel
some political pressure.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Clinton pointedly criticized Bush, the anticipated
Republican presidential nominee, for opposing hate crimes
legislation introduced in Texas after James Byrd, a black man, was
tied to a pickup truck and dragged to death by a group of white
men.
</P>
<P>
   ''All he had to do was to lift his hand and they would have had
a hate crimes bill,'' Clinton said then. ''And it did not pass
because they (Republicans) did not want it to pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush refused to get involved in the hate crimes debate in Texas,
saying ''all crime is hate crime.'' He responded to Clinton's
allegations by saying the Clinton administration ''would like to
spend a lot of time trying to tear me down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee echoed Bush's sentiment
Monday. ''All murder comes from hate and all people need to be
protected under the law,'' RNC spokesman Chris Paulitz said.
''We're not going to segregate Americans for political ploys like
the Democrats want us to do.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans are also trying to exclude hate crimes
programs from the federal education bill. The proposal would keep
the Education Department from using federal money specifically for
hate crimes prevention education, such as publishing brochures.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, Clinton's chief of staff John Podesta met with
the parents of Matthew Shepard, the gay college student who was
slain in Wyoming. Clinton did not meet personally with the Shepards
but told reporters later that he would press Congress to pass the
Hate Crimes Prevention Act.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate unanimously approved hate crimes prevention
legislation in July but it stalled in the House. Last month,
Clinton vetoed a spending bill for the Commerce, Justice and State
departments because the hate crimes provision was not in it.
</P>
<P>
   The hate crimes bill would add crimes motivated by a victim's
sexual orientation, sex or disability to the list of hate crimes
already covered under federal law -- those motivated by race,
religion, color or national origin. It would give federal
prosecutors the option of pursuing a hate crime case if local
authorities declined to press charges.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have said that the bill is redundant because it covers
acts that current law already punishes.

<HEADLINE> Babbitt May Back More Monuments  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A swath of Colorado canyons dotted with
American Indian ruins and an ecologically diverse mountain in
Oregon are ''at the top of the list'' to be new national monuments,
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt indicated Monday he is on the verge of recommending that
President Clinton create monuments around the southwestern Colorado
canyons and Soda Mountain near the Oregon-California line. They
would be the fifth and sixth monuments created by Clinton this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt has said the areas are unique and need to be protected
from mining and overuse by off-road vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The 1906 Antiquities Act gives presidents broad power to create
monuments and decide what uses should be restricted. Clinton has
created two new monuments each in California and Arizona this year,
prohibiting mining and logging in sequoia groves, the Grand Canyon
watershed, an arid mountain valley and hundreds of small islands in
the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Congress also may declare areas monuments. Republicans say
Clinton is circumventing the review process and ignoring the wishes
of local residents by unilaterally making the declarations.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not about the environment. It is about the constant
abuse of power by the Clinton-Gore administration,'' said Rep.
George Radanovich, R-Calif., and chairman of the House Western
Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Kupillas, a county commissioner who lives near Soda
Mountain, questioned whether monument designation is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could eliminate all of the multiple uses -- grazing, timber
harvest, recreational vehicles -- anything but hiking,'' she said.
''If this area is so valuable today, and we've had multiple use all
these years, why should we change it now?''
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt has discussed recommending the Colorado and Oregon
monuments before, and they are now ''at the top of the list'' as
the Clinton administration works to fill out its environmental
legacy, he said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt would not say precisely when he would ask Clinton to
declare the new monuments.
</P>
<P>
   He discussed the monument recommendations in an interview in
Washington before leaving for his hometown of Flagstaff, Ariz., to
renew his criticism of the 1872 law governing mining on federal
land.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt arranged to visit a pumice mine on the flanks of the San
Francisco Peaks today to criticize the law, which allows companies
to buy mining land for as little as $2.50 an acre and does not
require them to pay royalties to the government. He called the
mine, which produces rock used in stonewashing blue jeans, ''a
poster child for the abuses'' of the law.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases the mines are key to the local economy and Babbitt
acknowledged Congress is unlikely to change the law in an election
year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton vetoed an industry-backed reform proposal in 1995,
saying it had too many loopholes.

<HEADLINE> Secret Service Agent Has Gun Stolen  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A Secret Service agent assigned to protect first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton during a visit to Chicago last fall had
her gun stolen at a hotel bar that same day, the Chicago Sun-Times
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Citing statements from officials and court testimony, the
newspaper said the gun was in veteran agent Mary Drury's purse
under her chair when it was taken Oct. 27 at the Fairmont Hotel.
Drury had guarded Clinton at the Fairmont earlier that day but was
off-duty at the time of the theft.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Blake, a heroin addict who has been arrested 39 times,
was charged with possessing the stolen gun. He denied he took the
weapon, but at a hearing last week, Secret Service Agent William
Siemer testified that Blake bragged it was his ''insurance policy''
if he ever got into legal trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Police helped recover the gun last month in its customized
Secret Service holder.
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service wouldn't comment on whether Drury was
drinking when the theft happened. Even if agents aren't on duty,
the Secret Service discourages them from drinking at the same
location where they're protecting someone.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's something that shouldn't have happened from our
standpoint,'' said Arnette Heintze, the special agent in charge of
the Chicago Secret Service office. ''We take it very seriously and
put quite a bit of resources into the proper resolution of the
case.''
</P>
<P>
   Heintze would not say if Drury was reprimanded.
</P>
<P>
   Information about the theft surfaced late last week at Blake's
hearing. Blake has pleaded innocent and is in jail awaiting trial.
A federal judge approved a request that he be evaluated for drug
treatment.

Audio reviews from The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
   Selected new releases:
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''Tamar'' (Dreamworks) -- Tamar
</P>
<P>
   Toni may be the most famous of the Braxton clan, but the
multiplatinum singer doesn't have a lock on the family's talent.
That's made clear with ''Tamar,'' the self-titled debut from Tamar
Braxton, Toni's younger sister.
</P>
<P>
   Tamar -- who goes by her first name only -- released an album
before as part of The Braxtons, a trio of Braxton sisters, but that
effort was ignored critically and commercially. She should have
better luck this time around. She has a higher voice and a wider
range than Toni, but her sultry tone and dramatic phrasing
certainly will make listeners recall her superstar sister.
</P>
<P>
   Even with sometimes subpar material, Tamar shines on this disc.
Her breathy vocals breathe life into an unusually lackluster Missy
Elliott song, ''No Disrespect''; she soars on ''You Don't Know,'' a
breezy, mid-tempo groove with layered vocals to complement her
voice.
</P>
<P>
   But the best song is ''Money Can't Buy You Love.'' Along the
lines of TLC's ''No Scrubs'' and Destiny's Child's ''Bills, Bills,
Bills,'' the song is another in a stream of R&AMP;B songs in which
women demand a big-spending boyfriend (don't any of these women
have jobs these days?).
</P>
<P>
   But while the message may be questionable (''Money, power,
respect/I need the check''), its musical content is not. The sexy
jam burns with Tamar's smoldering voice, alternately defiant and
coy. With performances like this, Tamar won't be defined solely as
Toni Braxton's little sister for long.

   ''Allow Me'' (Zoe) -- Jules Shear
</P>
<P>
   Gee, from the cover photos of a downcast Jules Shear you'd
expect an album of whiny moping, but slip ''Allow Me'' into the
stereo and the sparkly pop of songs such as ''The More That I'm
Around You'' is a reminder that you can't judge a CD by its cover.
</P>
<P>
   Shear was the founder and original host of MTV ''Unplugged.'' He
has had songs covered by the Bangles (''If She Knew What She
Wants'') and Cyndi Lauper (''All Through the Night'') among others,
but despite his prowess as a writer, he has never had much
commercial success as a performer. If there were justice in the
music business, ''Allow Me,'' which is full of strong performances
and superior songwriting, would change that.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the addictive pop songs, ''Allow Me'' also features some
more introspective songs that showcase Shear's gift with lyrics. He
takes a turn at blue-eyed soul with the raucous ''Deep,'' a sort of
homage to Ray Charles with Vicki Peterson and Susan Cowsills of
Continental Drifters doing a fine Raelettes impersonation. It's a
winning package, even with the mopey photos.

   ''Believo!'' (SeeThru Broadcasting) -- Enon
</P>
<P>
   Enon, an enigmatic New York band featuring ex-members of
Brainiac and Skeleton Key, changes musical stripes like a music box
chameleon on its curiously arousing debut album, ''Believo!'' The
trio runs a gamut of post-alternative styles: a falsetto soul
melody coupled with a swamp-industrial bassline on ''Rubber Ear'';
wee morning noir-blues on ''Cruel''; Brian Eno-meets-Mr.Bungle on
''Conjugate the Verbs''; and the paved indie pop vocals of ''Come
Into.'' In ''Matters Gray,'' Enon outdoes Nine Inch Nails in the
dislocated un-love song category. Warmly optimistic and reminiscent
of prime XTC and Dukes of the Stratosphere, ''World in a Jar'' and
''For the Sum of It'' bring the disc to a sunny hilltop. Enon's
bumper stickers should read: ''You gotta Believo!''
</P>

<P>
   ''The Closer You Get'' (Mantra/Beggars Banquet) -- Six By Seven
</P>
<P>
   Six By Seven is an English group from Nottingham that cuts with
a serrated edge on their sophomore effort, ''The Closer You Get.''
Initial tracks such as the hypersonic ''Eat Junk Become Junk'' and
''Sawn Off Metallica T-shirt'' mirror Six By Seven's American
allies Girls Against Boys. Trunkloads of weathered emotion spill
open on ''New Year'' and ''One Easy Ship Away.'' ''My Life is an
Accident'' trumps Nine Inch Nails in the born-again, rise-above
category (pardon again, Mr. Reznor). Equal parts newfangled
steam-punk as well as radio-ready ballad dares, Six By Seven's
''The Closer You Get'' finds this band on the brink of aesthetic
breakthrough.

   ''Rise'' (Spitfire Records)-- Hair Of The Dog
</P>
<P>
   If the magic of hearing Kiss' ''Destroyer,'' Aerosmith's ''Toys
In The Attic'' or the opening notes of ''Van Halen I'' has been
absent from your life through the last 20 years of hard rock ...
then Hair Of the Dog might be just the medicine you need.
</P>
<P>
   The band's second album, ''Rise,'' is an ear-opening shot of
no-frills rock built on traditional hard-rock songwriting and
spiced with a dash of the Deep South.
</P>
<P>
   Singer Ryan Cook gives some great whiskey-soaked vocal lines in
''Five to Nine'' and ''Hammered.''
</P>
<P>
   Guitarist John Sepetys can shred with the best of them but also
tones it down and plays nice melodic phrases on ''You Are The One''
and ''Rescue Me.''
</P>
<P>
   The band closes with a great rendition of the song ''I'' from
Kiss' ''Elder'' album.

1/2 to 171 after reporting first-quarter operating earnings of
$178.1 million, or 64 cents a share. Analysts had expected Corning
to post operating earnings of 55 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has transformed its business in recent years
to focus on fiber optics, also released upbeat projections for the
remainder of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline.com, the name-your-price Internet company, said after
the close of trading Monday that its first-quarter loss was
narrower than expected and that sales surged more than 500 percent
compared with a year ago. Its shares rose 6 7/16 to 68 3/16 today.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which fell nearly 16 percent on Monday, rose 2 1/16
to 68 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   Also today, the Conference Board reported consumer confidence
slipped in April for the third consecutive month. The sign of
ebbing confidence may suggest to some investors that the exuberance
that drove the U.S. economy to an unprecedented growth spurt may be
ending. That could suggest that the Federal Reserve won't have to
dramatically raise interest rates to force a slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2-to-1 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 138.00 million
shares, ahead of Monday's calm pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index rose 11.33 to 479.87.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.1 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 1.8 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.9 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up
0.9 percent.

<HEADLINE> Gravely injured schoolboy's decade-old lawsuit settled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WOLCOTT, N.Y. (AP) -- A lawsuit on behalf of a 9-year-old boy who
was knocked down by a pickup truck outside his school in 1990 has
finally been settled, and a lawyer said the payments could
eventually total $37 million.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Knopp, now 19, lost much of his cognitive and
physical abilities as a result of the accident in front of Cuyler
Elementary School in Wolcott, a town 50 miles east of Rochester in
rural western New York.
</P>
<P>
   He requires around-the-clock assistance, can walk only short
distances and is blind in one eye. His mental abilities have not
advanced beyond a second-grade level, and he resides at a New
Hampshire school that offers specialized care.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Creek Central school district, the Wayne County Board of
Supervisors and the owner and driver of the pickup reached a
settlement with the boy's mother last month. It includes up-front
payments totaling $2.3 million in addition to monthly payments of
$12,835 from the school district and $6,431 from the county.
</P>
<P>
   The monthly payments are guaranteed for at least 15 years. The
family's attorney, Richard DeValk, said the payments could reach
$37 million if Knopp lives into his mid-70s.

<HEADLINE> Environmentalists ask GE stockholders to support PCB cleanup  </HEADLINE>
By L. ANNE NEWELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- State Comptroller H. Carl McCall and New
York City Comptroller Alan Hevesi are siding with environmental
groups urging General Electric to adopt a public education program
about the dangers of PCBs.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, one of 11 that will be voted on at the company's
annual shareholder meeting in Richmond, Va., on Wednesday, requires
the electric giant to report on plans to end further PCB
contamination in the Hudson and Housatonic rivers, develop ways to
cooperate with government agencies in cleanup and release details
of education efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ''General Electric has the wherewithal to ... make sure people
are aware of these issues,'' said Rich Schiafo, an environmental
associate with Scenic Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Schiafo's group, along with several other environmental and
religious organizations, is also asking shareholders to support a
proposal that would require GE to detail how much it has cost to
clean PCBs it released in the rivers decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   That proposal also requires that GE disclose how much it has
spent cleaning up its image through lobbying and public relations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to see how much money they've spent dragging their
feet on the cleanup,'' said Baret Pinyoun, a regional
representative for the Sierra Club. ''This has been going on for
over 10 years now.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the campaign, the groups encouraged McCall and
Hevesi, along with comptrollers in other states, to vote their
share of pension fund investments in GE in favor of the proposals.
</P>
<P>
   McCall will vote New York's 11 million shares in favor of both
proposals, said Dennis Tompkins, a spokesman for the comptroller's
office. McCall is the pension manager for GE stock through the $100
billion state and local retirement pension system.
</P>
<P>
   Hevesi's office said he will vote his city's approximately 12.9
million shares in favor of both proposals. Hevesi is manager of the
city's retirement system.
</P>
<P>
   But even with comptrollers' support, neither Pinyoun nor Schiafo
expected either proposal to pass. GE has about 2.1 million
shareholders who own about 3.3 billion shares of stock.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the education proposal has come up at the company's past
two shareholders meetings and garnered less than 10 percent of
shareholders' support. But the groups say just getting the
proposals to a vote is a victory in itself.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an effort to educate and keep these issues in front of
those people who are a part of General Electric,'' Shiafo said.
''We want people to know this is still an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolutions also don't have the support of GE. Mark Behan, a
company spokesman, called both resolutions unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   ''We report regularly to the state and federal agencies on our
cleanup work and research,'' Behan said. ''We've met every state
and federal requirement on the Hudson.''
</P>
<P>
   Behan said requiring GE to release monetary figures for cleanup
and lobbying doesn't make sense, since his company files normal
lobbying expenditure reports and acknowledges spending about $165
million so far on PCB cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   Behan also dismissed the education proposal, saying New York
already advises people not to eat fish caught in certain stretches
of the Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe those efforts have been highly visible and we
believe the role of establishing and publicizing fishing
restrictions and advisories properly rests with state or federal
regulatory agencies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   GE opposes an environmentalist-backed plan to dredge portions of
the Hudson River where PCBs have accumulated, a project would cost
hundreds of millions of dollars. The company maintains dredging
would only stir up PCBs and disperse them throughout the river. It
favors allowing the PCBs to be buried by the normal flow of the
river.
</P>
<P>
   GE legally used polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, for 30 years
in plants in Fort Edward and Hudson Falls before the chemical was
banned in 1977 by the federal government. The PCBs, which were used
in electrical equipment, have been linked to cancer in laboratory
animals. Their effect on humans is less clear.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency will make a final decision
on how to best clean the Hudson in June 2001.

<HEADLINE> Court Limits Appeals Over Lawyers  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today limited federal court
access for state prisoners who say their lawyers gave them
constitutionally inadequate help.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling 7-2 in an Ohio murder case, the justices said
ineffective-assistance claims that were filed too late in state
court generally cannot be used in federal court to excuse an
inmate's default of other claims.
</P>
<P>
   It is not enough to say ''the ineffective-assistance claim was
presented to the state courts, even though it was not presented in
the manner that state law requires,'' Justice Antonin Scalia wrote
for the court. ''That is not a hard question.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's ruling continues the court's trend, begun in the 1980s,
of making it more difficult for criminal defendants convicted in
state courts to go into federal courts and argue that their rights
were violated.
</P>
<P>
   The justices reversed a federal appeals court decision that set
aside Robert W. Carpenter's murder conviction in the 1988 fatal
beating of a 73-year-old woman in her Columbus home.
</P>
<P>
   After Carpenter's guilty plea and sentence were upheld in state
courts, he asked a federal judge to rule that the evidence
supporting his plea and sentence were constitutionally
insufficient, and that his lawyer was ineffective in failing to
raise that claim in his original appeal in state court.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge noted that Ohio courts dismissed the
ineffective-assistance claim on grounds Carpenter missed the
deadline for filing it. But the judge said he still could raise the
issue in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, saying the
ineffective-assistance claim served as ''cause'' to excuse
Carpenter's default of his other claim of insufficient evidence,
even if the ineffective-assistance claim was filed too late in
state court.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Supreme Court said the 6th Circuit court was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   State courts should be given a chance to correct their own
mistakes, Scalia said, adding that purpose would be frustrated
''were we to allow federal review to a prisoner who had presented
his claim to the state court, but in such a manner that the state
court could not ... have entertained it.''
</P>
<P>
   The justices returned the case to the 6th Circuit court, where
Scalia said Carpenter still can attempt to show that the Ohio
deadline for filing ineffective-assistance claims is not enough to
bar federal review of that claim. Carpenter also can attempt to
demonstrate he had adequate cause to default the
ineffective-assistance claim in state court, Scalia said.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia's opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy,
David H. Souter, Clarence Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Justices John Paul Stevens and Stephen G. Breyer agreed the case
should be returned to the 6th Circuit court, but they said the
majority's decision unnecessarily complicates the rules for
inmates' federal appeals of their state court convictions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why should a prisoner ... lose his basic claim because he runs
afoul of state procedural rules governing the presentation to state
courts of the 'cause' for his not having followed state procedural
rules?'' said Breyer, writing for the two.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Edwards v. Carpenter, 98-2060.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Philippines search for hostages kidnapped from divingresort  </HEADLINE>
By RANJAN ROY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEMPORNA, Malaysia (AP) -- Authorities hunted the seas between
Malaysia and the Philippines today for two fishing boats controlled
by heavily armed men holding 21 hostages they abducted from a
Malaysian diving resort two days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The kidnapping might be tied to Muslim rebels in the Philippines
who are seeking the release of militants jailed in the United
States, although some authorities said the Abu Sayyaf rebels were
just trying to attract attention.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our group is behind the abduction of the foreigners (in
Malaysia) and there are still a lot of surprises for the government
if they won't listen to us,'' Abu Sayyaf spokesman Abu Ahmad told
Philippine radio station DXRZ.
</P>
<P>
   Several hours later, however, Ahmad said he would neither
confirm nor deny his group was involved.
</P>
<P>
   Officials were searching today for the hostages -- half of whom
are foreign tourists. They were taken Sunday night from lush
Sipadan Island off the northern Borneo state of Sabah.
</P>
<P>
   A police intelligence report said the hostages were taken to the
province of Sulu at the southern tip of the Philippines, no more
than an hour's boat ride from Sipadan. But Lt. Edgar Joseph Andres,
a navy pilot, said he found nothing in a three-hour search of the
sparsely inhabited area today.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysian officials said today that the kidnappers were believed
to be outside Malaysian waters.
</P>
<P>
   A waitress from the Philippines who escaped the abduction added
weight to the Muslim rebels' claim that they were involved. Jeneth
Cagaanan said when one of the men grabbed her, she replied to him
in Suluk -- the language prevalent in the southern Philippines -- and
that he understood her.
</P>
<P>
   Cagaanan also said one of the assailants wore a vest emblazoned
with the initials of the Moro National Liberation Front, the
Philippines' largest Muslim rebel group before it signed a peace
accord in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Five people were being questioned in connection with the
abduction, Sabah chief of police Mamat Talib said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said some of those arrested were former employees of the
Sipadan resort and were tied to the Filipino fishing community
along Sabah's eastern coastline.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on Sipadan began Sunday when six masked gunmen,
carrying AK-47s and a rocket launcher, grabbed tourists and workers
and confiscated their cash and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen then forced their hostages to swim to two fishing
boats, which sped away and appeared to be heading toward Philippine
waters.
</P>
<P>
   Eyewitnesses said two of the captives -- James and Mary Murphy,
both 51, of Rochester, N.Y. -- escaped after James Murphy told the
assailants his wife didn't know how to swim. When the kidnappers
turned around, the American couple ran into the bushes and hid
until dawn.
</P>
<P>
   In the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, James Murphy declined
today to talk extensively about his ordeal. ''We don't want our
comments to overshadow anything that's going on with the
situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages forced onto the fishing boats included tourists --
two French, three Germans, two South Africans, two Finns and one
Lebanese -- and nine Malaysians who either worked at the resort or
for the wildlife service. One was a Filipino resort employee and
the nationality of the 21st hostage wasn't immediately released.
</P>
<P>
   Another hostage situation was escalating in a remote area of the
southern Philippines, about 275 miles north of Semporna, the port
from which tourists take boats for Sipadan. On the island province
of Basilan, troops shelled Abu Sayyaf camps again today as soldiers
battled their way up a mountain where the rebels were holding 27
Filipinos captive.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Calimlim, chief of intelligence for the Philippine
military, said an air force plane and navy boats were searching
Philippine waters near Malaysia for the hostages captured Sunday.
He doubted the Abu Sayyaf claim of credit.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a part of their propaganda because they are really
trying to attract attention, especially international attention,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have demanded the freedom of Arab terrorist suspects
in U.S. jails, including Ramzi Yousef, mastermind of the 1993
bombing of the World Trade Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad insisted Malaysia was still a
safe tourist destination. The Sabah economy relies heavily on the
400,000 people who visit its beach resorts and rain forests every
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't get this kind of thing happening in Malaysia very
often,'' Mahathir said. ''It will affect tourism in Sabah, but the
rest of the country is not affected by this. Malaysia is very safe
for tourists.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be of little comfort to Yee Mui Phia, a guide at
Sipadan Dive Center who sat today in his empty office in Semporna.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are scared,'' he said. ''And what's more important, it will
affect our business.''

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Fee Assessment Not Automatic  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Judges cannot immediately assess lawyers' fees
against someone who was added as a defendant to a federal lawsuit
after final judgment in the case, the Supreme Court ruled today.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling unanimously in an Ohio patent-infringement case, the
justices said people who are added to a case after judgment must be
given a chance to contest the fees that are sought from them.
</P>
<P>
   The company president in the case ''was never afforded a proper
opportunity to respond to the claim against him,'' Justice Ruth
Bader Ginsburg wrote for the court. ''Instead, he was adjudged
liable the very first moment his personal liability was legally at
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg said that violated federal trial rules and the
constitutional due-process rights of Donald Nelson, president of
Ohio Cellular Products Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer-fee dispute stems from a lawsuit filed in 1994 by
Ohio Cellular, which manufactured athletic protective pads based on
its patent for a method of molding pad material into a desired
shape.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio Cellular accused Adams USA and Apehead Manufacturing of
infringing on the patent. The two companies countersued and won a
federal court ruling that Ohio Cellular's patent was invalid.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies then sought attorneys' fees from Ohio
Cellular, but that company's lawyer advised them that if they
sought more than nominal fees, Ohio Cellular would be liquidated.
</P>
<P>
   The judge granted lawyers' fees of $178,888 based on the finding
that when Ohio Cellular sought its patent, Nelson failed to
disclose a similar prior invention.
</P>
<P>
   Adams and Apehead then won court permission to add Nelson to the
case as a defendant, and the judge immediately ordered him to pay
the lawyers' fees. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit upheld the decision, saying Nelson ''hardly was a stranger
to the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Supreme Court said the Federal Circuit court was
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ''Due process does not countenance such swift passage from
pleading to judgment in the pleader's favor,'' Ginsburg wrote in an
opinion that also quoted, in a footnote, from the trial sequence in
''Alice in Wonderland.''
</P>
<P>
   The opportunity to respond is ''fundamental to due process,''
Ginsburg said.
</P>
<P>
   The court ordered the case returned to the trial court to give
Nelson a chance to argue against being held liable for the fees.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Nelson vs. Adams USA, 99-502.

<HEADLINE> DOT Prepares New Truck Driver Rules  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is getting ready to propose new
rules for how many hours truck drivers can work and how long they
have to be off -- changes that already have the industry worried.
</P>
<P>
   Currently truckers are limited to 10-hour shifts with at least
eight hours off in between.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules would permit 12-hour shifts with 12 hours off in
between, according to sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to reduce driver fatigue by making sure they have
enough time off to sleep and to get drivers onto a 24-hour cycle.
With the current rules some drivers worked rotating shifts,
reaching their weekly 60-hour driving limit in four or five days.
</P>
<P>
   While the Transportation Department formal was to be announced
late today, the American Trucking Association was warning that it
would result in a need for more trucks and drivers on the highways.
</P>
<P>
   ''This proposal could mean a 50% increase in the number of
refrigerated and dry van trucks on our already-crowded highways;
that translates into as many as 180,000 additional drivers and
trucks on the road just to keep the current economy moving, '' said
ATA president Walter B. McCormick, Jr. ''This all adds up to a
threat to the U.S. economy and American jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The current driving rules took effect in 1939 and the revisions
have been under discussion for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Once the new rules are proposed they will be open to public
comment and hearings will be held.
</P>
<P>
   There were 5,302 people killed in truck-related accidents in
1998, a slight drop from 1997 and part of a trend in which the
truck-related highway fatality rate has been falling, despite
increased trucking mileage.

58.63 at 10,964.73.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 26.09 at 1,455.95.
</P>
<P>
   Strong earnings reports lured investors back to the technology
sector after a wave of selling on Monday. Corning Inc. soared 25
3/4 to 174 1/4 after reporting first-quarter operating earnings of
$178.1 million, or 64 cents a share. Analysts had expected Corning
to post operating earnings of 55 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has transformed its business in recent years
to focus on fiber optics, also released upbeat projections for the
remainder of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline.com, the name-your-price Internet company, said after
the close of trading Monday that its first-quarter loss was
narrower than expected and that sales surged more than 500 percent
compared with a year ago. Its shares rose 4 3/4 to 66 1/2 today.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which fell nearly 16 percent on Monday, rose 1 13/16
to 68 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   ''Technology stocks have been sold down so sharply that some
investors believe it's bargain-hunting time in the tech and telecom
sectors,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock
&AMP; Co. ''It appears for now that many Nasdaq stocks are oversold.''
</P>
<P>
   After punishing selloffs earlier this month, the Nasdaq is now
28 percent below its all-time high of 5,048.62, reached March 10.
The Nasdaq is also down for the year, but it remains nearly 37
percent above its level at this time last year.
</P>
<P>
   For today, at least, the technology companies that dominate the
Nasdaq were posting better earnings reports than the blue-chip Dow
components. Procter &AMP; Gamble fell 4 15/16 to 65 9/16 today after
saying earnings in the third fiscal quarter fell 28 percent from a
year ago because of higher costs. The report confirmed Procter &AMP;
Gamble's dour warning in early March that sliced more than $35
billion from the company's market value.
</P>
<P>
   Also, 3M fell 7 3/4 to 89 3/4. The company met earnings
expectations, but warned that profit growth for the full year may
slow and is not likely to exceed analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Conference Board reported consumer confidence slipped
in April for the third consecutive month. The sign of ebbing
confidence may suggest to some investors that the exuberance that
drove the U.S. economy to an unprecedented growth spurt may be
ending. That could suggest that the Federal Reserve won't have to
dramatically raise interest rates to force a slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2-to-1 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 472.19 million
shares, ahead of Monday's calm pace. On the Nasdaq, advancers led
by a 3-to-2 margin.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index rose 11.55 to 480.09.

<HEADLINE> Gun Goes Off on Alaska Air Flight  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- A pistol discharged inside a bag in the
baggage compartment of an Alaska Airlines plane that was still
sitting on the ground and the bullet entered the passenger
compartment. No one was injured.
</P>
<P>
   The .357-caliber bullet went through the floor of the passenger
cabin and lodged in a diaper bag underneath a seat Monday night on
Flight 101, said Doug Roberts, spokesman for the Port of Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Passenger Grant Johnston, who had placed the diaper bag under
the seat, told KGW-TV that he heard a loud noise at his feet and
notified a flight attendant.
</P>
<P>
   ''She went and checked with the pilot and came back and said it
was probably just the cargo door closing, but a few minutes later
they said somebody had a loaded gun in their suitcase and when the
baggage handler threw it on board, it went off,'' said Johnston, of
Anchorage, Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing 737 had been scheduled to take off from Portland
International Airport on a flight to Anchorage, Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   The crew and 85 of the 86 passengers were transferred to another
plane.
</P>
<P>
   One passenger, Betty Jean Smith, 66, of Eagle River, Alaska, was
charged with reckless endangerment and concealing a weapon without
a permit. She was released to relatives in Vancouver, Wash. The gun
was one of two in her bag.
</P>
<P>
   Regulations require that passengers declare guns when they have
them in checked luggage, and that those guns be unloaded, Roberts
said.
</P>
<P>
   If the gun had fired during the flight at a high altitude and
the bullet had made a large hole through a window, the aircraft
would have had rapid decompression, said Alaska Airlines spokesman
Bill MacKay. However, he said, if it had penetrated the plane's
outer skin the hole would have been smaller without a threat of
rapid decompression.

<HEADLINE> Memphis Has Rock, Soul Music Museum  </HEADLINE>
By WOODY BAIRD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- In the family tree of rock 'n' roll,
Memphis is the roots.
</P>
<P>
   With Elvis Presley, B.B. King, Al Green and Jerry Lee Lewis
having started their careers in this Mississippi River city, it's
only fitting for the Rock 'n' Soul Museum to settle here, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Beale Street attraction -- which features juke boxes, film
clips, and artifacts including Presley's clothes and one of Ike
Turner's first pianos -- opens Saturday in the newly built Gibson
Guitar Corp. plant, offering visitors an auditory stroll through
American music history.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you want to experience the roots of modern music, this is
the place to start,'' said Steve Masler, managing curator.
</P>
<P>
   The 8,000-square-foot exhibit, ''Rock 'n' Soul: Social
Crossroads,'' was created by the Smithsonian Institution and
Memphis Rock 'n' Soul Inc., a nonprofit company that runs the
museum. Under a 10-year contract with the Smithsonian, the museum
traces the influences of the Memphis region on modern music.
</P>
<P>
   ''Blues, country and gospel resonated with the rhythms of the
land, and as sharecroppers moved to Memphis, they took this music
with them,'' said Pete Daniel of the Smithsonian. ''In the urban
setting of Memphis, this music evolved into rock 'n' roll, and a
new music tradition was born.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gibson plant, which will produce the company's Classic ES
series of electric guitars, will be open for public tours, too. The
block-long plant, just around the corner from Elvis Presley's
Memphis nightclub and the B.B. King Blues Club, also will include a
cafe for visitors, an outdoor plaza and a rooftop terrace.
</P>
<P>
   The Rock 'n' Soul exhibit, on the second floor, will begin its
story with a reproduction of a sharecropper's cabin and wrap up
with displays on the recording studios in Memphis today, like
Ardent and the House of Blues.
</P>
<P>
   In between are exhibits on the big-band days of Beale Street,
the radio pioneering of WDIA and other Memphis stations, the
rockabilly of the Memphis Recording Service (Sun records), and the
soul of Stax and Hi Studios.
</P>
<P>
   Film clips include performances by artists such as Otis Redding
and Presley, as well as interviews with more than 70 pioneers of
Memphis music: artists, producers, engineers and record shop
owners.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered through the artifacts on display are five juke boxes
from the 1930s through the 1970s. Visitors can listen to up to 20
recordings from each of the various periods.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can punch in any of those songs or all of them and hear
them as long as you want to stand there,'' Masler said.
</P>
<P>
   Also on display are a motorcycle once owned by Sam the Sham, and
clothes worn by Isaac Hayes, Carla Thomas and Albert King.
</P>
<P>
   Rock 'n' roll pioneer Sam Phillips, who helped launch the
careers of Presley, Lewis, B.B. King and many others on the Sun
label, bought a sound board and other recording equipment used,
because of his limited budget. But it was his pride and joy.
</P>
<P>
   ''He says he used to come down to the studio at night just to
look at it,'' Masler said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's a permanent part of the museum collection.

<HEADLINE> Posters Bring Early Aviation to Life  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Overhead the jut-jawed hero wings past in his
red biplane. Looking skyward, the lady in a striped dress waves at
his bravery. The earliest days of flight live again in a display of
posters at the National Air and Space Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Artist Edouard Montaut painted the intrepid flyer and his
admirer before an orange sky to draw visitors to aviation week in
Riems, France in 1909.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they are among 32 posters used between 1876 and 1914 on
display in ''Looping the Loop,'' a show drawn from the collection
compiled by Willis M. Allen of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ''Posters -- the mass medium of the day -- were designed to
generate excitement about this new technology and encourage
consumers to spend their leisure time in the world of aviation,''
said Joanne Gernstein London, curator of the show that opens
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm good at finding things,'' beamed hotelier Allen,
discussing his collection of posters and memorabilia of early
flight.
</P>
<P>
   Allen has compiled more than 100 aviation posters at Allen
Airways Flying Museum in El Cajon, Calif. They are detailed in his
book, ''Looping the Loop,'' co-authored with the late U.S.
ambassador Henry Serrano Villard.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest posters on display at the Smithsonian show date
from before the Wright Brothers took to the air, advertising
balloon rides at carnivals.
</P>
<P>
   One at the exhibit entrance dates back to 1890. An unknown
French artist included brightly colored balloons and ladies in
Oriental garb, all the rage in Europe at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Other posters take the viewer through early flight meets at a
time when the population was entranced by the frightening new
ability to take to the air.
</P>
<P>
   Even advertising posters are on display, brightly extolling the
value of Bosch magnetos in 1911 and Fischer's version a year later.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition will remain at the National Air and Space Museum
until July 9. Then it will travel to the Thames Science Center in
Newport, R.I., from July 22 to Oct. 8 followed by the Virginia Air
and Space Center in Hampton from Oct. 29 to Jan. 7, 2001. Future
sites are being planned.

<HEADLINE> Government not monitoring mercury in fish report says  </HEADLINE>
By CAREN BENJAMIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is shirking its responsibility
to protect consumers -- particularly pregnant women and young
children -- from dangerous levels of mercury in fish, a coalition of
environmental groups said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A report by the Vermont-based Mercury Policy Project, the Sierra
Club, California Communities Against Toxics and others criticized
the Food and Drug Administration for no longer testing mercury
levels in tuna, swordfish and shark caught by U.S. fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   What little data exists shows all three of those heavily
consumer species often contain unsafe levels of mercury, according
to the report.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should have that information to provide people so they can
make reasonable,informed choices,'' said Michael Bender, head of
the Mercury Project and one of the report's authors.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury is a metallic chemical element that also is byproduct of
pollution including coal-fired power plants and trash incinerators.
When ingested, it can cause neurological damage. Fetuses and young
children are particularly vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   FDA officials say they can prove the food supply is safe based
on historical data. ''The question is: Do we want to spend taxpayer
dollars to test fish if we have no reason to believe the levels
have changed,'' said Dr. Gregory Cramer, an FDA chemist.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA deems fish safe if they contain less than the agency's
''action level'' of one part per million of methylmercury.
</P>
<P>
   The goverment's 1991 food fish survey showed the most popular
species of food fish had substantially less mercury than one part
per million, Cramer said.
</P>
<P>
   Retesting is unnecessary because mercury levels in the water
have not risen much since then, Cramer said. ''There is no reason
to believe that levels in the food supply have dramatically changed
from these historic levels,'' Cramer said.
</P>
<P>
   But the FDA's own limited data shows that mercury levels in food
fish are often dangerously high, the report found.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1992 and 1998, 36 percent of the swordfish samples taken
had unsafe mercury levels by the FDA's standards.
</P>
<P>
   The last time canned tuna was checked for mercury was in 1995.
Only 11 cans of tuna were sampled though most Americans eat about
10 cans a year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Of those cans tested 85 percent had mercury levels of up to 0.3.
Given the aggregate amount of tuna many people eat, that could
still be cause for serious concern, Bender said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those results argue strongly for continued monitoring to
protect our children,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont. Last
year Leahy and Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, asked the FDA to restart
mercury monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ignoring the problem certainly won't make it go away or
prevent the potential damage to human health from methlymercury in
seafood,'' Harkin said.
</P>
<P>
   The senators also questioned whether the 1 part per million
''action level'' is appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency's mercury action level is
0.1 part per million, Leahy noted.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific studies are split on how much ingested mercury can
harm a fetus. ''One study says there is a problem, one says there
isn't. The Mercury Project believes it's better to err on the side
of caution,'' Bender said.
</P>
<P>
   People are eating approximately 25 percent more fish now and so
may be far more exposed to mercury than when the action level was
set 20 years, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Cramer said the increase is not enough to matter. ''Maybe people
are eating more but not dramatically so,'' he said, adding that the
government is currently studying mercury exposure in the American
diet.
</P>
<P>
   The environmentalists' report also noted that many states issue
health alerts for river, lake and noncommercial ocean fish that
have mercury levels half that of what the FDA considers dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Connecticut's Council on Environmental Quality
released its annual report outlining environmental concerns
including how fish in all of the state's rivers and lakes are
contaminated with mercury.
</P>
<P>
   The council's report recommends that the Department of
Environmental Protection work aggressively to reduce mercury
emissions by 50 percent within five years and by 100 percent within
10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut DEP Commissioner Arthur Rocque Jr. said Connecticut
is one the leaders of controlling mercury in the region.

<HEADLINE> Promoter says benefit show will be moved if necessary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WEEDSPORT, N.Y. (AP) -- A promoter said Tuesday he remains
optimistic that local officials will permit a three-day music
festival that is intended to benefit local food pantries.
</P>
<P>
   Promoter Nick Papatonis said organizers were shocked last week
when Town of Brutus and Cayuga County Health Department officials
threatened them with arrests and prosecution if they continued to
advertise Musicstock 2000, scheduled for July 3-5 during the Cayuga
County Fair.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials say there have been problems with noise, litter,
drinking, disturbances, crime and violence at fairground concerts
in recent years and are concerned the festival will turn into
another drunken bash.
</P>
<P>
   ''The last thing I want to do is move it out of the county but
they are telling us to cease and desist promotion of it or else
they are going to come and arrest us,'' Papatonis said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they're just overestimating (the crowd) big time. This
isn't Woodstock. I'm optimistic we can settle this,'' Papatonis
said.
</P>
<P>
   If not, Papatonis said he already has a possible alternative
site in Lewis County. In that case the proceeds will support the
food pantries of the county where the benefit is held, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers have lined up 65 local bands to play on three stages
during the county fair. The groups, performing all styles from rock
to country, are playing for free. The festival is sponsored by Papa
John's Pizza, Kinkos and local television and radio stations and
all the profits will go to local food programs.
</P>
<P>
   Papatonis said health officials told him the county can support
its own food programs.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials fear the event will draw a huge, rowdy crowd.
They have suggested that organizers are disorganized, pointing to
their request for volunteers to take care of security and first aid
at the concert. Promoters and fairground owner Glenn Donnelly have
not even applied for routine town permits, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Using volunteers is a way to keep more money for the food
programs, Papatonis said.
</P>
<P>
   He said officials are overestimating the expected crowd.
Realistically, 2,000 people can be expected, he said. Town law
requires a permit for an event that draws more than 1,000 people
but the county law defines a mass gathering as 5,000 people.

<HEADLINE> Safety Council Announces Proposals  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Safety Council on Tuesday
announced its ''Safety Agenda for the Nation,'' a wide-ranging
series of proposals and partnerships aimed at reducing accidental
loss of life on the highways, at work and at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most unintentional injuries are preventable,'' council
president Jerry Scannell said.
</P>
<P>
   ''For most of our lives, we Americans can substantially reduce
our greatest risk of dying by taking simple steps to enhance our
safety -- buckling up when we drive, exercising care on steps and
ladders and around swimming pools, following the instructions when
taking drugs or medicine and rigorously adhering to safety
procedures at work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The wide ranging safety problems are too big to be solved by one
organization so the group has formed partnerships with businesses
as well as private and governmental organizations, Scannell said.
</P>
<P>
   The group estimated that 52,000 people died and 14.5 million
were injured in accidents at home and in public places in 1999, up
21 percent since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Falls were the primary cause of death and injury, especially for
older adults, the council noted.
</P>
<P>
   The group said it is working with the American Association of
Retired Persons to work on preventing falls and encourage the
development of safer home design.
</P>
<P>
   An average of 14 people are killed in the workplace every day,
the council said.
</P>
<P>
   The council said it is working with the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration and National Institute for Occupational
Safety and Health to expand the use of better safety practices at
work.
</P>
<P>
   The group said it is enlisting the aid of business management
and unions in an effort to develop a ''safety culture'' at work.
''Company policy and workstation practice must dictate that safety
never take a back seat to other interests,'' Scannell said.
</P>
<P>
   On the road, where nearly 41,000 deaths occurred in 1999, the
council said it will crusade to get everyone to fasten seat belts.
It will also encourage safer cars and improved medical services as
well try to get all states to tighten drunken driving laws and
mandate seat-belt use.

<HEADLINE> Gwyneth Paltrow in Car Accident Suit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Gwyneth Paltrow is being sued by two people
who accuse her of crashing her rental car into their vehicle,
injuring both.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred in West Hollywood on April 24, 1999,
according to the Superior Court lawsuit. Midway Rent-A-Car was also
named.
</P>
<P>
   There were no details about the accident in the suit filed by
Veronica Cabello and H. Jorge Arauz. They're seeking unspecified
damages for medical expenses as well as repair of their car,
attorney James Earle said.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of their ''permanent and serious injuries'' wasn't
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone messages left for Paltrow's publicist, Stephen Huvane,
and attorney, Harold Brown, weren't immediately returned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Paltrow isn't the first actress with road trouble in recent
days.
</P>
<P>
   Halle Berry pleaded innocent April 7 to leaving the scene of an
accident, also in West Hollywood, in which both she and the driver
of another car were injured. She faces up to a year in jail if
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Catherine Zeta-Jones was sued by a woman who says she
was hurt in a car crash last summer. She was a passenger in the car
Zeta-Jones was driving when it crashed in Pacific Palisades, the
suit said.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- There's more to Bruce Willis' appearances on
''Friends'' than a potential ratings boost.
</P>
<P>
   Willis, who agreed to be a guest star on NBC's ''Friends'' for

share the money, Willis publicist Paul Bloch said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   On ''Friends,'' Willis plays the widowed father of Ross' new

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- City plans to honor ''Peanuts'' creator
and St. Paul native Charles Schulz with a display of fiberglass
Snoopys has won the support of his family.
</P>
<P>
   The city has proposed a series of Snoopys decorated in various
artistic styles to be put on public display this summer. As many as
50 of the beloved beagles could be included.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the plan are to be announced Friday by Mayor Norm

</P>
<P>
   While the colorful statues are meant as a temporary tribute, the
city also is working on a permanent memorial to Schulz, said Erich

<HEADLINE> Spears' Friends To Go on Tour  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU (AP) -- Britney Spears says she stays grounded with the
help of three childhood friends.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people change,'' the 18-year-old pop diva said, ''and
a lot of people try to change you. But it's very important to stay
grounded and be yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Those friends are accompanying her on the Hawaii leg of a
month-long tour promoting her new CD, ''Oops ... I Did It Again.''
</P>
<P>
   Spears entertained thousands of fans at a free Waikiki concert
Monday, part of a ''Britney in Hawaii'' FOX TV special that will
air in June.
</P>
<P>
   The singer also said she is getting used to her packed schedule
since the release of her hit CD, ''... Baby One More Time.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's fun being me,'' she said. ''Of course, there are a lot of
bad days. But I try to be positive. I have a lot of good days, as
well.''

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Up 146; Dow Up 120  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly higher today as technology
shares benefited from strong corporate earnings reports and
rebounded from a steep plunge Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite index
was up 146.76 at 3,629.24. The Dow Jones industrial average was up
120.99 at 11,027.09.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 32.01 at 1,461.87.
</P>
<P>
   Strong earnings reports lured investors back to the technology
sector after Monday's selloff. Corning Inc. soared 25 3/4 to 174
1/4 after reporting first-quarter operating earnings of $178.1
million, or 64 cents a share. Analysts had expected Corning to post
operating earnings of 55 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has transformed its business in recent years
to focus on fiber optics, also released upbeat projections for the
remainder of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline.com, the name-your-price Internet company, said after
the close of trading Monday that its first-quarter loss was
narrower than expected and that sales surged more than 500 percent
compared with a year ago. Its shares rose 1 1/2 to 63 1/4 today.
</P>
<P>
   Sapient Corp., a technology consulting company, rose 12 13/16 to
72 13/16 on the Nasdaq. Two Wall Street brokerages raised their
ratings on the stock after the company reported robust profit
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which fell nearly 16 percent on Monday, rose 2 5/16
to 68 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   ''Technology stocks have been sold down so sharply that some
investors believe it's bargain-hunting time in the tech and telecom
sectors,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock
&AMP; Co. ''It appears for now that many Nasdaq stocks are oversold.''
</P>
<P>
   After punishing selloffs earlier this month, the Nasdaq is now
28 percent below its all-time high of 5,048.62, reached March 10.
The Nasdaq is also down for the year, but it remains nearly 37
percent above its level at this time last year.
</P>
<P>
   For today, at least, the technology companies that dominate the
Nasdaq were posting better earnings reports than the blue-chip Dow
components. Procter &AMP; Gamble fell 4 13/16 to 65 11/16 today after
saying earnings in the third fiscal quarter fell 28 percent from a
year ago because of higher costs. The report confirmed Procter &AMP;
Gamble's dour warning in early March that sliced more than $35
billion from the company's market value.
</P>
<P>
   Also, 3M fell 7 1/4 to 90 1/4. The company met earnings
expectations, but warned that profit growth for the full year may
slow and is not likely to exceed analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Conference Board reported consumer confidence slipped
in April for the third consecutive month. The sign of ebbing
confidence may suggest to some investors that the exuberance that
drove the U.S. economy to an unprecedented growth spurt may be
ending. That could suggest that the Federal Reserve won't have to
dramatically raise interest rates to force a slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2-to-1 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 690.72 million
shares, ahead of Monday's calm pace. On the Nasdaq, advancers led
by a 3-to-2 margin.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index rose 11.93 to 480.47.

<HEADLINE> Court Throws Out Ohio State Motto  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NOLAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Ohio's motto, ''With God, all things are
possible,'' violates the U.S. Constitution as a government
endorsement of religion, the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
ruled today.
</P>
<P>
   A panel of the federal court sided with the American Civil
Liberties Union, which contended that the words had no secular
purpose and appeared to be a government endorsement of the
Christian religion.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio took the motto in 1959 from the Bible, specifically Matthew
19:26, which quotes Jesus Christ.
</P>
<P>
   ''I read it to mean it's thrown out completely,'' said Mark
Cohn, a lawyer for the ACLU. ''It cannot be used by the state as
its motto.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohio Attorney General Betty Montgomery said the state will ask
the 6th Circuit court to delay its decision during any appeals.
</P>
<P>
   The state could appeal the court's 2-1 ruling to the full,
13-judge appellate court or ask the Supreme Court to review it.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU had asked the appeals court to reverse a 1998 decision
by a federal judge in Columbus that allowed Ohio to display the
motto as long as it does not cite the biblical origin.
</P>
<P>
   Within days of the ruling, workers installed a bronze plaque
bearing the state's seal and the motto in a plaza sidewalk leading
to one of the main entrances of the Statehouse in Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   The state argued that the motto does not compel people to
believe anything and that to some people it would not have a
religious connotation.
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. George Voinovich said he got the idea to place the
motto at the Statehouse during a trade mission to India, where he
spotted a public building that bore the phrase, ''Government Work
is God's Work.'' Voinovich is now a U.S. senator for Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU and the plaintiff it represents, the Rev. Matthew
Peterson, a Presbyterian minister in suburban Cleveland, objected
to Ohio's use of the motto and challenged all of Ohio's official
uses of the motto. It has appeared for years on the Ohio secretary
of state's stationery, on some state reports and on Ohio tax
returns.

<HEADLINE> Internet Costs Drag CBS Profit Down  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS Corp. reported big gains in revenues and
operating profits for its first quarter Tuesday but still posted a
net loss because of $75 million in expenses related to developing
its Internet operations.
</P>
<P>
   CBS, which is nearing completion of its acquisition by MTV owner
Viacom Inc., had a net loss of $38 million, or 5 cents a share,
beating analyst expectations of a loss of 7 cents per share, as
reported by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   In the same period a year ago, CBS had net income of $387
million, which included a gain of $366 million from sales of
various assets. Not counting that gain or other one-time items, CBS
had income from continuing operations of $25 million or 4 cents a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues jumped 36 percent to $2.40 billion from $1.77 billion.
</P>
<P>
   CBS attributed the large gains in revenues to advertising growth
in its television business, which includes the CBS network as well
as 16 stations in major markets, as well as higher results in its
Infinity subsidiary, a leading radio broadcasting and outdoor
advertising company.
</P>
<P>
   CBS said that its cash flow, or earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation, amortization and equity losses, jumped 85 percent to
$517 million in the first quarter compared to $280 million in the
same period a year ago. Cash flow is an indicator often examined by
analysts to gauge the health of a company's underlying businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in CBS were up $2.37{ to $56.37{ in afternoon trading on
the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   CBS has stakes in a number of Internet companies, including CBS
Marketwatch.com, and recently formed a separate division to pool
those stakes together under one management team.
</P>
<P>
   That division had losses of $75 million associated with its
Internet investments, which include iWon.com, a site that has been
heavily promoted with cash giveaways. Without those losses, the
company said it would have reported income from continuing
operations of $35 million, an increase of 40 percent over last
year's first quarter.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks a Hate-Crimes Vote  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hoping to hone in on a perceived Republican
weakness, President Clinton today sought to revive stagnant
hate-crimes legislation in hopes of forcing a vote in Congress
before the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, along with Attorney General Janet Reno, gathered state
law enforcement officials at the White House to mobilize public
support for the bill and press Republican congressional leaders to
take it up.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you believe that everyone counts and that everyone should
have a chance to live his or her life, and if you believe we all do
better when we work together, then you've got to help us pass this
legislation,'' the president said. ''It's very important and we
don't have a single excuse not to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also released a guide for local prosecutors on
responding to hate crimes, and a list of state projects under way
to prevent hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   While congressional Democrats denied any political motives, the
White House admitted using the hate-crimes issue as a wedge to
force the GOP to back up its ''compassionate conservative''
rhetoric with action.
</P>
<P>
   ''If, politically, the Republicans feel the heat ... then that's
great, but the reality is there is not an overt political agenda
here. The message is this bill is needed,'' said Will Keyser,
spokesman for Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., who is seeking to
attach a hate-crimes amendment to another bill.
</P>
<P>
   A senior White House official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Monday that Texas Gov. George Bush's ''trouble with
Bob Jones and extremist elements in the Republican Party'' were
factors in renewing the push for a hate-crimes bill. The official
was referring to Bush's failure to denounce the South Carolina
university's ban on interracial dating during a speech at the
school.
</P>
<P>
   Bush apologized for not speaking out a week after winning the
South Carolina GOP primary.
</P>
<P>
   The hate-crimes bill had broad support among Republican
lawmakers, the official said, and the hope is that the Republican
leadership ''will view this legislation in a new way'' if they feel
some political pressure.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Clinton pointedly criticized Bush, the anticipated
Republican presidential nominee, for opposing hate-crimes
legislation introduced in Texas after James Byrd, a black man, was
tied to a pickup truck and dragged to death by a group of white
men.
</P>
<P>
   ''All he had to do was to lift his hand and they would have had
a hate-crimes bill,'' Clinton said then. ''And it did not pass
because they (Republicans) did not want it to pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush refused to get involved in the hate-crimes debate in Texas,
saying ''all crime is hate crime.'' He responded to Clinton's
allegations by saying the Clinton administration ''would like to
spend a lot of time trying to tear me down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee echoed Bush's sentiment
Monday. ''All murder comes from hate and all people need to be
protected under the law,'' RNC spokesman Chris Paulitz said.
''We're not going to segregate Americans for political ploys like
the Democrats want us to do.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans are also trying to exclude hate-crimes
programs from the federal education bill. The proposal would keep
the Education Department from using federal money specifically for
hate crimes prevention education, such as publishing brochures.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, Clinton's chief of staff, John Podesta, met with
the parents of Matthew Shepard, a gay college student who was slain
in Wyoming. Clinton did not meet personally with the Shepards but
told reporters later that he would press Congress to pass the Hate
Crimes Prevention Act.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate unanimously approved hate-crimes prevention
legislation in July but it stalled in the House. Last month,
Clinton vetoed a spending bill for the Commerce, Justice and State
departments because the hate crimes provision was not in it.
</P>
<P>
   The hate-crimes bill would add crimes motivated by a victim's
sexual orientation, sex or disability to the list of hate crimes
already covered under federal law -- those motivated by race,
religion, color or national origin. It would give federal
prosecutors the option of pursuing a hate-crime case if local
authorities declined to press charges.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have said that the bill is redundant because it covers
acts that current law already punishes.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court-Abortion Chronology  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   A chronology of some of the Supreme Court's major
abortion-related decisions.
<TEXT>
<P>
   --Jan. 22, 1973. In Roe vs. Wade, the court for the first time
legalized abortion nationwide. The court based its 7-2 ruling on a
woman's constitutional right to privacy.
</P>
<P>
   --Jan. 22, 1973. In Doe vs. Bolton, the court struck down by a
7-2 vote restrictions on facilities that could be used to perform
abortions. The decision gave rise to a new kind of medical
facility, the abortion clinic.
</P>
<P>
   --July 1, 1976. In Planned Parenthood vs. Danforth, the court, by
a 6-3 vote, said states cannot give husbands veto power over their
pregnant wives' decision to abort their pregnancies. By a 5-4 vote,
the court said parents of minor, unwed girls cannot be given an
absolute veto over abortions.
</P>
<P>
   --Jan. 9, 1979. In Colautti vs. Franklin, reached by a 6-3 vote,
the court reaffirmed its intention to give doctors broad discretion
in determining the timing of ''fetal viability'' - when a fetus can
live outside the mother's womb. The justices said states may seek
to protect a fetus that has reached viability, but the
determination is up to doctors, not courts or legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   --June 15, 1983. In three decisions led by one called City of
Akron vs. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, the court said,
6-3, that states and local communities may not require all
abortions beyond the first trimester be performed in a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   --June 11, 1986. In Thornburgh vs. American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the court struck down, 5-4,
Pennsylvania abortion regulations that would have required doctors
to inform women seeking abortions about potential risks and about
available medical assistance benefits for prenatal care and
childbirth.
</P>
<P>
   --July 3, 1989. In a series of split votes in Webster vs.
Reproductive Health Services, the court provided states with new
authority to limit a woman's right to abortion but stopped short of
reversing its 1973 decision legalizing abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The justices allowed Missouri to restrict the use of public
money, medical personnel or facilities in performing abortion
procedures. Also upheld was a requirement that doctors determine,
when possible, whether a fetus at least 20 weeks old is capable of
surviving outside the womb, by testing lung capacity and conducting
other tests.
</P>
<P>
   --June 29, 1992. In its most important abortion ruling since
1973, the court voted 5-4 to uphold the core of its Roe vs. Wade
decision and ban states from outlawing most abortions. But, by a
7-2 vote, the court said states may raise new hurdles for women
seeking to end their pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision in Planned Parenthood vs. Casey abandoned
the trimester-by-trimester approach of its 1973 ruling and adopted
a new test -- abortion regulations will not be allowed if they
represent an ''undue burden'' on women's constitutional right.

   Gates: Microsoft Must Remain Intact
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. chairman Bill Gates said today
that future products, and therefore consumers, would suffer if the
company is broken up by the federal government. In an interview
with The Associated Press, Gates said new versions of the Windows
operating system, the software that powers the vast majority of the
world's personal computers, would be stunted if the Windows or
Office software divisions were split from the rest of the company.
He said there wouldn't be a Windows today if it hadn't been for the
two groups working together. Gates spoke by telephone from a
computer hardware developers' conference in New Orleans. A breakup
of Microsoft is one of a number of possibilities being studied by
the federal government and 19 states in the antitrust case against
the software maker. Microsoft stock was up 2] at 69 this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Gives Workers More Stock
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft employees will receive a new bundle of
stock options at yesterday's low closing price, a move designed to
offset the stock's poor performance on Wall Street in recent weeks.
In an internal e-mail obtained by The Associated Press, Microsoft's
chief executive, Steve Ballmer, told all company employees they
would receive an additional stock option grant equal to any
previous grants they had received since last July. ''I think the
(original) grants will have value long-run, but I want to pre-empt
undue concerns by awarding these new grants that will let people
see returns much sooner,'' Ballmer wrote in his e-mail, sent early
this morning.

   Consumer Confidence Slips in April
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Consumer confidence slipped in April for the
third consecutive month as the stock market staged a sharp retreat.
But the Conference Board reading was stronger than Wall Street
analysts had expected. The board's Consumer Confidence Index
dropped to 136.9 in April from a revised 137.1 the month before.
Lynn Franco, director of the board's research center, said the
recent volatility in the financial markets has had little, if any,
impact on consumer confidence. She added that while consumers rate
current economic conditions less positively than last month, their
outlook for the next six months has improved.
</P>
<P>
   Existing-Home Sales Rise in March
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite rising mortgage rates, sales of
existing homes rose by 1.5 percent in March, the second straight
monthly gain. Sales rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
4.83 million units after climbing nearly 7 percent in February, the
National Association of Realtors said today. Many analysts had
expected sales to fall 1.7 percent in March.

the surge in crude oil prices over the last year a big factor.
Exxon Mobil Corp., Texaco Inc. and Conoco Inc. profits all topped
Wall Street analysts' estimates for the quarter. Exxon Mobil earned

share a year ago. Revenues for the quarter were $8.69 billion, up
from $5.34 billion last year.

   P&AMP;G Third-Quarter Earnings Drop
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Procter &AMP; Gamble Co.'s earnings for its third
fiscal quarter fell 28 percent from a year ago because of higher

   DuPont First-Quarter Earnings Rise
</P>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- DuPont's first-quarter earnings
increased 21 percent, a gain the chemical giant partially
attributed to increased sales and double-digit earnings growth in
more than half its business units. Net income was $803 million, or
76 cents a share, compared with earnings of $663 million, or 58
cents a share, for the same quarter of the previous year. Revenues

   Bell Atlantic Matches Expectations
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Operating profits rose 10 percent at Bell
Atlantic in the first quarter, matching most forecasts for a period
highlighted by the local telephone company's debut as a long
distance provider. Bell Atlantic's operating profit totaled $1.27
billion, or 80 cents a share, in the first three months of the
year. An accounting charge of $536 million left a net profit of
$731 million or 46 cents a share, reflecting the shifting value of
an investment in Cable &AMP; Wireless Communications of Britain.

   3M First-Quarter Earnings Rise
</P>
<P>
   MAPLEWOOD, Minn. (AP) -- New products, successful marketing and a
good economy helped boost 3M Co. earnings 18 percent in the first
quarter to $455 million, excluding a one-time gain from ending a
marketing agreement. The earnings of $1.13 per share compared with
$384 million, or 95 cents a share, in the same period a year ago.
With the $50 million pre-tax gain from the termination of a
distribution agreement with Hoechst to market 3M's CFC-free asthma
inhalers, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing reported net earnings
of $487 million, or $1.21 per share, a 27 percent increase.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Climbs 160; Dow Gains 162  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Bargain-hunting investors, enticed by a round of
strong corporate earnings reports, scooped up technology stocks
today and helped the Nasdaq composite index rebound from a steep
plunge Monday.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the
Nasdaq composite index was up 160.93 at 3,643.41, nearly wiping out
Monday's 161.40-point drop. The Dow Jones industrial average was up
162.57 at 11,068.67.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 36.58 at 1,466.44.
</P>
<P>
   Strong earnings reports lured investors back to the technology
sector after Monday's selloff. Corning soared 25} to 174\ after
reporting first-quarter operating earnings of $178.1 million, or 64
cents a share. Analysts had expected Corning to post operating
earnings of 55 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has transformed its business in recent years
to focus on fiber optics, also released upbeat projections for the
remainder of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline.com, the name-your-price Internet company, said after
the close of trading Monday that its first-quarter loss was
narrower than expected and that sales surged more than 500 percent
compared with a year ago. Its shares rose 2} to 64{ today.
</P>
<P>
   Sapient., a technology consulting company, rose 12 to 72 on the
Nasdaq. Two Wall Street brokerages raised their ratings on the
stock after the company reported robust profit growth.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which fell nearly 16 percent on Monday, rose 2 5/16
to 68 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   ''Technology stocks have been sold down so sharply that some
investors believe it's bargain-hunting time in the tech and telecom
sectors,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock
&AMP; Co. ''It appears for now that many Nasdaq stocks are oversold.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some favorites that suffered in recent weeks bounced
back strongly. JDS Uniphase was up 11 3/16 to 91{.
</P>
<P>
   After punishing selloffs earlier this month, the Nasdaq is now
28 percent below its all-time high of 5,048.62, reached March 10.
The Nasdaq is also down for the year, but it remains nearly 37
percent above its level at this time last year.
</P>
<P>
   For today, at least, the technology companies that dominate the
Nasdaq were posting better earnings reports than the blue-chip Dow
components. Procter &AMP; Gamble fell 5 15/16 to 64 9/16 after saying
earnings in the third fiscal quarter fell 28 percent from a year
ago because of higher costs. The report confirmed Procter &AMP;
Gamble's dour warning in early March that sliced more than $35
billion from the company's market value.
</P>
<P>
   Also, 3M fell 5 13/16 to 91 11/16. The company met earnings
expectations, but warned that profit growth for the full year may
slow and is not likely to exceed analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's solid advance came from technology and financial
names. Intel rose 6 9/16 to 122 11/16 and American Express gained 5
5/16 to 155].
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Conference Board reported consumer confidence slipped
in April for the third consecutive month. The sign of ebbing
confidence may suggest to some investors that the exuberance that
drove the U.S. economy to an unprecedented growth spurt may be
ending. That could suggest that the Federal Reserve won't have to
dramatically raise interest rates to force a slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2-to-1 margin on the
Nasdaq and on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to
829.92 million shares, ahead of Monday's calm pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index rose 14.83 to 483.37.

<HEADLINE> Demonstrators Out in Abortion Case  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A throng of demonstrators huddled outside
underneath umbrellas, praying and chanting as the Supreme Court
considered its first abortion case in eight years on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm hoping this is the first brick to come down in the wall of
a women's right to choose to murder her offspring,'' said Honey
Burke, a mother of three who came with her husband from San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   An abortion rights supporter, District of Columbia resident
Jonathan Darr, said, ''It seems like what they're trying to do is
chip away at Roe vs. Wade, and that's a dangerous thing for women
and for men who support women's rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Some anti-abortion protesters were arrested for refusing to
remove billboard-style banners depicting aborted fetuses that they
had erected on the sidewalk in front of the court.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they took 22 people into custody for violating a
federal regulation limiting the size of such displays.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests were made after justices had finished their
hour-long hearing of oral arguments in a case challenging a
Nebraska law banning a surgical procedure that opponents call
partial birth abortion.
</P>
<P>
   While the court was in session, anti-abortion and
abortion-rights demonstrators -- a few dozen people on each side --
vied to outdo each other with signs and slogans, enduring a steady
spring rain.
</P>
<P>
   A group organized by the National Organization for Women marched
in a circle in front of the graphic anti-abortion banners chanting:
''Right to life, that's a lie. You don't care if women die.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This case is much more than a dialogue about a particular
procedure. This case is about whether a woman will be able to
continue to make good sound medical decisions and rely on the good
judgment of her doctor,'' said NOW vice president Elizabeth Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Scheidler, director of Chicago-based Pro-Life Action
League, described what's at stake from his perspective: ''If the
court will say that some kinds of abortion are so outrageous that
you can outlaw them, then it sends a message that abortion isn't a
right, you can restrict it.''
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge last year ordered Scheidler and other national
anti-abortion leaders to pay damages to and stop interfering with
the operation of abortion clinics across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The two groups of demonstrators generally kept a respectable
distance from each other on Tuesday, avoiding direct confrontation
or conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our point of view is that we need to work at protecting all
human life. Whether it is in rape, incest or in a petrie dish, life
begins at the moment of fertilization,'' said Tina Whittington, who
works for anti-abortion group in Stafford, Va.
</P>
<P>
   With a nod toward those on Whittington's side, Hannah Olanoff,
president of NOW's local chapter, said ''I don't believe that they
want to have a dialogue ... they want to cut me out of the
decision.''

<HEADLINE> Pardon Requested in Nuns' Killing  </HEADLINE>
By DIEGO MENDEZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARCEL LA ESPERANZA, El Salvador (AP) -- One of two former
soldiers imprisoned for the rape and murder of four U.S. religious
workers said Tuesday that he has asked for a presidential pardon.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Contreras also reiterated the soldiers' previous
defense that they were only acting on orders, and he asked the
victims' families for forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wasn't the group's decision, it was an order. We opposed
the crime,'' Contreras said in an interview with The Associated
Press. He said he did not know exactly where the order came from,
however.
</P>
<P>
   Contreras is one of five ex-national guardsmen sentenced in 1984
to 30 years in prison for the rape and murder of U.S. nuns Ita
Ford, Maura Clarke, and Dorothy Kazel, and social worker Jean
Donovan in December 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the soldiers were freed in 1998 under a law that
shortened most prison sentences in the country to relieve prison
crowding. Contreras and a fifth soldier, Carlos Palacios, asked
congress on March 2 for a similar amnesty, but prosecutors say they
are ineligible for early release because they allegedly
participated in jail uprisings.
</P>
<P>
   In a plea for compassion, San Salvador Archbishop Fernando Saenz
asked the government Sunday to pardon Contreras and Palacios.
</P>
<P>
   Contreras said he sent a letter six months ago to President
Francisco Flores asking for a pardon, but that he hasn't received
any response.
</P>
<P>
   Of the victims' families, he said this: ''I'd like to ask them
their pardon and I want them to know, that it wasn't our fault.''
</P>
<P>
   The families of the victims said they believe the women were
targeted because officials suspected they sympathized with leftist
guerrillas during the war.
</P>
<P>
   A 1993 United Nations Truth Commission report concluded that one
of the guardsmen, Subsergeant Luis Antonio Colindres Aleman,
''obeyed the orders from his superiors to execute'' the women.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the report said that the director of the National
Guard at the time, Col. Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova, and other
high-ranking officers ''knew that National Guard members had
committed the assassinations under orders from their superiors.''
</P>
<P>
   Vides has dismissed the report as incomplete or biased.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Questions Labor Dept. on Grants  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm
on Tuesday questioned the Labor Department's authority to hold up
mass transit funding over worker rights issues, citing a labor
dispute in Boston that could cost taxpayers more than $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm, R-Texas, said a 1964 law giving the Labor Department the
power to delay federal grants was due for a change. He said it
gives labor unions ''the ability to veto acts of Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Anderson, a Labor Department assistant secretary,
defended the law, saying it has protected transit employees' wage
and working conditions. He told the Banking Committee that the
process has been streamlined in recent years so that 97 percent of
contracts are certified within 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the hearing focused on a case in Boston where the Bay
State Transit Serves last May won a contract with the Massachusetts
Bay Transportation Authority to clean and maintain commuter trains.
Their offer of $175 million over five years was $116 million less
than the bid of current operator Amtrak.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, Bay State promised to give priority to
current Amtrak workers and provide union jobs at wage and benefit
levels comparable to those offered by Amtrak.
</P>
<P>
   But Bay State representative James Stoetzel, testifying at the
hearing, said the Labor Department has jeopardized federal funding
to the MBTA by imposing what he said were new so-called 13(c)
obligations -- or labor conditions under the 1964 law.
</P>
<P>
   The result, he said, has been ''to delay, thwart, and perhaps
even eliminate altogether the ability of the parties to implement a
legitimate, competitively bid service agreement.'' Without that
agreement, the contract might revert to Amtrak, at far greater
expense to taxpayers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Moneypenny, legislative representative for the Transport
Workers Union of America, said the issue was Bay State's strategy
of trying to deal individually with Amtrak workers rather than
going through the union. ''This bid was predicated on the notion
that you could break the unions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts' Democratic Sen. John Kerrey agreed that Bay
State's low bid was based on the premise that it would have a
smaller, less costly work force. ''It has a name today and it's
called union busting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee G. Gibson, chief operating officer of the Regional
Transportation Commission in Las Vegas, also spoke of what he
called ''13(c) woes,'' citing a dispute with the Amalgamated
Transit Union over whether a new contractor must abide by
conditions set by an existing union.
</P>
<P>
   ''It became obvious that the real issue was not the protection
of employees in a change from one contractor to the next, but
rather the preservation of the ATU as the permanent bargaining
representative,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But ATU international president James La Sala said the Labor
program has been a success and ''claims of so-called delays in
section 13(c) case processing are a manufactured myth, based on the
experience of only a few transit properties each year.''

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Opposition Backers Killed  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Two more backers of Zimbabwe's biggest
opposition party have been slain, a party official said Tuesday,
bringing to six the number of opposition supporters killed in
violence that began with the illegal occupation of white-owned
farms.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the farm-occupation crisis appeared to have delivered
a blow to Zimbabwe's already downtrodden economy. The land
occupations and the violence that has surrounded them have
disrupted deliveries of the tobacco harvest -- Zimbabwe's biggest
hard-currency earner -- on the eve of the crucial tobacco auction
season.
</P>
<P>
   Only 7,000 bales of tobacco were delivered in advance for
Wednesday's opening auctions. Usually, 90,000 bales would be
available for auction in the first week, tobacco marketing
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   White farmers were skeptical of government assurances that
police would now provide security in farming areas. About 1,000
farms have been seized since February by armed black squatters, and
two white farmers with links to the opposition Movement for
Democratic Change have been killed this month.
</P>
<P>
   President Robert Mugabe has insisted that the occupations are a
justified protest by land-hungry blacks against a few thousand
whites who own about a third of the nation's productive land. But
opponents of the government accuse Mugabe of allowing the violent
occupations to shore up his flagging popularity ahead of national
elections expected to be called in May. Opponents also argue Mugabe
wants to punish farmers for supporting the opposition party, known
as MDC.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, MDC spokesman Nomore Sibanda said two more black
supporters of the party were killed.
</P>
<P>
   David Nhaurwa was killed by ax blows to the head Monday north of
Harare after his assailants demanded he prove his loyalty to the
ruling party by producing a membership card, Sibanda said. He said
MDC organizer Robert Mbuzi died from gunshot wounds suffered Friday
after he tried to organize a party meeting at Mhangura, 95 miles
northeast of Harare. Further details were not immediately
available.
</P>
<P>
   ''People fear for their lives. They are being told to give up
supporting MDC,'' said Nicholas Hwindiri, a party official in the
northern town of Kariba, along the Zambian border.
</P>
<P>
   Nine opposition supporters were assaulted Monday and Tuesday in
Kariba and others fled their homes after ruling party officials --
two armed with a pistol and a rifle -- led attackers with iron bars
onto residential properties, Hwindiri said.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, hundreds of mourners paid their respects Tuesday to
tobacco farmer David Stevens, who was shot dead April 15 by mobs
occupying his land in the Macheke district, 75 miles east of
Harare.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope for the sake of the ones that have lost their lives,
including David, that something good will come out of this dreadful
and intimidating situation,'' Stevens' widow Maria said in a
written statement.
</P>
<P>
   Police have largely ignored violent attacks on those resisting
the land occupations. A pledge Tuesday by Agriculture Minister
Joyce Mujuru that police will now enforce law and order in farming
districts was unlikely to reassure jittery farmers ahead of the
opening of the tobacco-selling season.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe is the world's second biggest tobacco exporter after
Brazil; the product earned $335 million here last year. Delayed
returns from tobacco will hit financial markets by preventing
farmers from honoring debts to the local banks.

<HEADLINE> Greek Jews Look To Save Synagogues  </HEADLINE>
By PATRICK QUINN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Greece's Jewish community, almost wiped
out during World War II, said Tuesday that it will launch a
campaign to raise about $1 million to save its few remaining
synagogues and cemeteries.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish leaders said they decided to act after vandals last week
splashed red paint on a Holocaust memorial and sprayed swastikas
with the German word ''raus,'' or ''get out,'' on a synagogue in
Thessaloniki.
</P>
<P>
   The vandalism in Thessaloniki hit a sore spot as more than 90
percent of the 80,000-strong Jewish community in that northern port
were killed in Nazi death camps. Only 5,000 Jews remain in Greece.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish leaders said many Jewish holy sites around Greece
have been taken over, destroyed or allowed to fall apart, despite
Jewish protests to the government.
</P>
<P>
   Moses Constantini, head of Greece's Central Board of Jewish
Communities, said he is seeking to raise just over $1 million to
fence some cemeteries and repair at least one synagogue on the
verge of collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Constantini said he is looking abroad because of government
indifference and he plans to go to Washington next week and attend
the annual meeting of the American Jewish Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to build anything. I just want to save
monuments,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''These monuments have historic value and great significance for
European and world Jewish history,'' he said. ''If these monuments
are not protected efficiently, it is certain that in the course of
time they will be trespassed upon, destroyed and lost, as
unfortunately has been the case in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   He said although cemeteries are protected by law, some towns
have appropriated the land, in one case building a road through one
and in another building a reservoir in the middle of one.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of these cemeteries have no walls, even shepherds graze
sheep through them,'' Constantini said. ''We just want to build a
wall around them, to respect the dead and the monuments.''
</P>
<P>
   ''After the Holocaust the motto was 'first the living and then
the dead,''' he said. ''Now the new generation wants to save its
heritage. The slogan now is 'not to lose one stone more.'''
</P>
<P>
   The first recorded Jewish community in Greece is thought to date
to 300 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   The country once had 27 Jewish communities, but after the
Holocaust many survivors went to the United States and Israel,
leaving Greece with three organized communities.

<HEADLINE> Group: Judge Lied in Abortion Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Cleveland Bar Association has filed a
complaint accusing a judge of lying when questioned about a woman's
claim that she was jailed to prevent her from getting an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The bar association also charged that Cuyahoga County Common
Pleas Judge Patricia A. Cleary abused her discretion in sentencing
a pregnant Yuriko Kawaguchi in 1998 for her role in a credit card
scam.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint accuses Cleary of sending Kawaguchi to jail
''solely due to Judge Cleary's bias and/or religious beliefs that
abortions are immoral.''
</P>
<P>
   The complaint also said Cleary lied to a bar association
committee that was reviewing the case.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint was released Monday by an arm of the Ohio Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   A three-person panel will now be appointed by the Ohio Supreme
Court's Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline to hear
the case. Cleary could be reprimanded or disbarred.
</P>
<P>
   The judge did not return calls for comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Kawaguchi pleaded guilty to forgery, which usually carries a
sentence of probation. But Cleary sentenced her to six months in
jail with credit for 4{ months already served.
</P>
<P>
   Kawaguchi said the judge wanted to prevent her from having an
abortion. The judge has said Kawaguchi's sentence was based on the
severity of her crime.
</P>
<P>
   Kawaguchi was released on appeal but decided to carry the baby
to term. She has since given birth to a girl. Earlier this month,
an appeals court overturned the six-month sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Cleary is running for a third term in November.

<HEADLINE> Gen Xers Want More Political Ads  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Feeling neglected in the political process, a
Generation X group wants more of what many Americans hate most
about politics: campaign ads.
</P>
<P>
   In reaching for viewers most likely to vote, campaigns advertise
during programs with a disproportionately older audience, according
to a study released Tuesday that documents a widely used strategy.
That leaves some younger people without information that's easily
available to older viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The research sponsored by Third Millennium, an advocacy group
for Generation Xers -- generally people in their 20s to early 30s --
essentially unravels from the back end what political pros take as
gospel on the front end: Campaigns spend their ad money to reach
potential voters.
</P>
<P>
   Third Millennium acknowledges that if young people want more
information about politics, all they have to do is pick up a
newspaper, turn on a news show or surf the Internet. The group also
allows that political ads, derided by many as shallow and
manipulative, are not necessarily the best source of information.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the group argues, these ads are an important part of
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''All seniors and near-seniors need to do is sit back and watch
the programs they seemingly enjoy watching. The political
information will come to them,'' said the report, which analyzed
presidential campaign ads in four cities important to this year's
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Emily Fredrix, a sophomore at Washington University in St.
Louis, agreed there's a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're kind of the forgotten group,'' said Fredrix, 20, of
Solon, Ohio. She said her friends don't talk or care about
politics. ''I'm almost seen like a weirdo because I care so much
about voting.''
</P>
<P>
   But her friends could change, Fredrix said. ''If they bought a
spot on 'Dawson's Creek,' that would be great.''
</P>
<P>
   Using data on television viewing and political advertising
trends, the study found that just 17 percent of ad viewers were 18
to 34, although these people made up 26 percent of the voting-age
population.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a vicious cycle of mutual neglect,'' said Richard D.
Thau, president of Third Millennium. ''In a chicken and egg
scenario, who's more to blame, the chicken or the egg?''
</P>
<P>
   Viewers of all ages could get a steady diet of political ads if
they watched TV news. Forty-four percent of ads aired before,
during or after news programs.
</P>
<P>
   But young people are less likely to watch TV news, the report
said. Meanwhile, in Manchester, N.H., just five presidential ads
aired on ''Ally McBeal.''
</P>
<P>
   From Dec. 1, 1999 through March 7, the study examined media
markets in Manchester, in the leadoff primary state;
Greenville-Spartanburg, S.C., where Republicans waged a hard-fought
primary, and in Los Angeles and New York, which voted on Super
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Combining the four markets, just 36 ads ran during ''Friends,''
and 16 ran during ''The Simpsons,'' including syndicated reruns.
''Wheel of Fortune'' and ''Jeopardy!'' were more popular choices
during the same time slots.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the ''Today'' show attracted 651 ads during the
period.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigns are simply hunting where the ducks are, said Kathleen
Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School for Communication at
the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, the first presidential year in which 18-year-olds could
vote, no one knew how influential they would be and campaigns spent
considerable time and money courting young people. But it quickly
became clear that they were much less likely to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''You put your money where you'll get the highest yield,''
Jamieson said. ''You'd be foolish not to.''
</P>
<P>
   A better way to increase participation by young people, she
said, is to boost civics lessons and encourage public service
campaigns like ''Rock the Vote.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaigns of Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore
both said they were taking steps to reach out to young people.
Still, said Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer, ''It's heartening to know
there's a group of Americans who want more political commercials
rather than less.''

<HEADLINE> Protesters Prepare in Puerto Rico  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA VILLERRAEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Reacting to reports that Marines are
setting sail to arrest them, Puerto Rican protesters braced Tuesday
for a possible showdown on the dusty, cratered expanse of the U.S.
Navy's Vieques bombing range.
</P>
<P>
   After a year of holding the Navy at bay, demonstrators camped
out on the range said the threat of arrests won't stop their
campaign to shut down the Navy's prime Atlantic training ground.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know all the risks and I am ready to be arrested,'' said
65-year-old Felicita Garcia, camped with about 30 other people
outside the front gates of the training ground. ''We are resolved
to go the all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of people joined the protesters at camps set up after an
April 1999 accident on the range, which is littered with unexploded
bombs and shells. A 500-pound bomb launched off-target killed a
civilian security guard.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Pedro Rossello urged the protesters to leave Tuesday, even
offering them public land outside the training ground for their
camps.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are asking that the removal be voluntary and peaceful ...
so that there will be no kind of confrontation,'' Rossello said.
</P>
<P>
   But the demonstrators refused, saying they would replace any
arrested protesters by cutting through fences or sending in
reinforcements on horseback.
</P>
<P>
   Angel Navarro, 72, planned to take his small fishing boat
through any blockade.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was a sergeant in Korea for 11 months ... fighting for
democracy -- now I'm ready to fight the Navy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Monday that a raid on the camps by U.S. Marshals and FBI agents
could occur as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the news was leaked, islanders began moving to the
camps -- where numbers vary from less than 10 on weekdays to dozens
at weekends -- said one organizer, Robert Rabin. More than 60 people
were on the range by Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   There were unconfirmed reports that two ships in Norfolk, Va.,
were preparing to carry Marines to set up a security perimeter
around the 21-mile-long island, just east of Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Local police are to provide five patrol boats, helicopters and
100 to 200 officers in case of any raid, Police Superintendent
Pedro Toledo said Tuesday. He said the police would only provide
transport and crowd control and would not enter the range because
it is federal property.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy has practiced bombing and other exercises in Vieques
since 1941. Last year's accident created island-wide outrage that
has drawn support from environmental and other groups in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters have stood in the way of a pact between President
Clinton and Rossello that would allow exercises to continue without
explosives until Vieques's 9,400 residents vote in a referendum on
whether to expel the Navy. Clinton has agreed to order the military
out by May 2003 if the Navy loses the referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters celebrated a minor victory Tuesday as the Navy
announced the USS George Washington battle group would train off
the U.S. East Coast instead of Vieques on May 12-20.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether that might cause authorities to postpone
the reported plans. But demonstrators said they were not lowering
their guard. On Tuesday, they continued to block vehicles carrying
troops or non-Vieques residents from the range.
</P>
<P>
   A scuffle with one driver Tuesday drew more than 250 people to
the gates in 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Manning his post at the protest camp outside the gate,
90-year-old Nazario Cruz wagged his white beard angrily as he and
other protesters discussed the reports of a possible raid.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is unworthy of the American nation,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Abortion Case Quotes  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Quotes from and about the Supreme Court hearing
Tuesday in a
case challenging a Nebraska law, similar to laws in 29 other
states, banning a medical procedure opponents call partial-birth
abortion:
<TEXT>
<P>
   ''The state's interest here is drawing a bright line between
abortion and infanticide.'' -- Nebraska Attorney General Don
Stenberg.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''This law is so broadly written it could prohibit most
second-trimester abortions performed in the state of Nebraska.'' --
Simon Heller, a lawyer representing a Nebraska doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''The state could have been concerned about rendering society
callous to infanticide ... the horror of seeing a live human
creature outside the womb dismembered. Can't that be a valid
societal interest?'' -- Justice Antonin Scalia.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''This law seems out of the bounds that this court has set for
pre-viability regulation.'' -- Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''If the court will say that some kinds of abortion are so
outrageous that you can outlaw them, then it sends a message that
abortion isn't a right, you can restrict it. It would indicate the
court has at least some concept of a victim, not only the woman.''
-- Joseph M. Scheidler, Pro-Life Action League director.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''Essentially, it's a strategy by anti-abortion-rights people to
end all abortions ... They use the political term 'partial birth
abortion' rather than a medical term that would be more precise,
precisely because they're going after other procedures.'' --
Patricia Ireland, National Organization for Women president.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: 'Frequency'  </HEADLINE>
By MATT CRENSON, AP National Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new time-travel movie ''Frequency'' spirits us back to a
legendary moment in baseball history -- October 1969.
</P>
<P>
   As the Miracle Mets are winning the World Series, something even
more miraculous is happening elsewhere in Queens. New York City
firefighter Frank Sullivan (Dennis Quaid) is talking by ham radio
with his son, who is sitting in the same chair 30 years in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   A bizarre solar disturbance, so powerful that it makes the
northern lights visible in New York, has allowed the two to
communicate through time rather than space.
</P>
<P>
   It seems unbelievable at first. But the son, John, is able to
prove to his father what is going on by calling the World Series,
play-by-play, before it happens.
</P>
<P>
   John (Jim Caviezel) has grown up in the shadow of tragedy. On
Oct. 12, 1969, his father was killed in a warehouse fire, and John
has never recovered. He stumbles through life, drinking Bushmills
from the bottle and pondering what could have been.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take John long to figure out what he needs to do. By
warning his father of what is to come, he may be able to save the
old man's life and cure his own despair.
</P>
<P>
   But when he does prevent his father's death, the consequences
ripple through the past, visiting other horrors on their lives.
Working together, separated by three decades, the father and son
struggle to set things right. Their mission: to stop a serial
killer before he murders someone close to them both.
</P>
<P>
   ''Frequency'' is a movie of, for and about guys. It has
baseball, firefighting, homicidal maniacs and time travel, for
goodness' sake.
</P>
<P>
   But deep in its heart, ''Frequency'' also cherishes those shaky,
washed-out old home movies of family barbecues and days at the
beach.
</P>
<P>
   This makes for some unavoidable father-son heart-to-hearts, of
course. But they aren't too excruciating, and they are more than
offset by fiery action sequences that reek of adrenaline and
testosterone.
</P>
<P>
   Quaid and Caviezel both pull off the Queens shtick without a
hitch, and Andre Braugher is a natural as (what else?) a homicide
detective. Noah Emmerich (brother of writer Toby) plays John's
lifelong pal Gordo.
</P>
<P>
   The script is the first effort of Toby Emmerich, an executive at
New Line, the studio that made the film. But this is no vanity
project.
</P>
<P>
   ''Frequency'' plays ingenious games with the latest theoretical
physics, speculating on how parallel universes may be linked up and
what might happen as we jump between them. It feels exhilarating as
it whips back and forth from future to past without leaving us
behind.
</P>
<P>
   In a cameo, theoretical physicist Brian Greene explains the
science behind this fiction. Superstring theory, you see, suggests
that there may be 10 or more dimensions in the universe. And more
than one of them may be time dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe you could send information backwards in one time
dimension by shooting it through another. But if there were some
phenomenon allowing such a thing, solar flares wouldn't be powerful
enough to trigger it. It would take something along the lines of a
black hole.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. The science is merely a setup for director Gregory
Hoblit, who has turned the script into an intense and entertaining
thriller.
</P>
<P>
   ''Frequency'' is rated PG-13.

<HEADLINE> Convicted Soviet Partisan Released  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIGA, Latvia (AP) -- Latvia's Supreme Court released convicted
war criminal Vasily Kononov from custody Tuesday and ordered an
investigation of his controversial conviction -- a move welcomed by
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Kononov, 77, was sentenced in January to six years in prison
after being convicted of ordering the execution in 1944 of nine
civilians, including a pregnant woman and several children, who he
suspected of pro-Nazi sympathies.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Kononov led a small band of pro-Soviet partisans
who fought the Nazis occupying Latvia.
</P>
<P>
   Kononov, who had been in custody since his arrest in 1998, has
maintained his innocence, claiming those who died got caught in the
cross fire in a battle between pro-Soviet and Nazi-backed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow has sharply criticized the detention of Kononov, who many
Russians consider a war hero. Russian President Vladimir Putin
granted Kononov Russian citizenship this month to underline his
displeasure.
</P>
<P>
   The Riga court asked prosecutors Tuesday to provide clearer
proof the victims were unarmed civilians. It also called for
testimony from experts on whether the offenses amounted to war
crimes, said Leonards Pavils, a court spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Pending a final ruling on whether Kononov's conviction should be
overturned, he will be allowed to return to his home in Riga for
health reasons, Pavils said. He is not permitted to change
residency or leave the country.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Ausma Rubene said she was surprised at the court's
ruling and that she feared Kononov could try to flee the country
for Russia, the Baltic News Service reported.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Ambassador to Latvia Alexander Udaltsov praised the move
as ''a serious step toward justice,'' Russia's ITAR-Tass news
agency reported. The ambassador planned to present Kononov later
with his Russian passport, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Latvia has vowed to bring both Soviets and Nazis who committed
atrocities to trial. But while it has convicted three Soviet
sympathizers, no Nazis have been charged or convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Latvia was independent before being occupied and annexed by the
Soviet Union in 1940. After the 1941-44 Nazi occupation, Soviet
troops occupied Latvia again, remaining until the Baltic state
regained independence from Moscow in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, many Latvians ended up fighting on either
side, often after being conscripted.

<HEADLINE> WWI Gallipoli Landings Marked  </HEADLINE>
By BURHAN OZBILICI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANAKKALE, Turkey (AP) -- On the 85th anniversary of the
Gallipoli landings, about 10,000 people gathered on the beach
Tuesday to remember the World War I campaign that cost hundreds of
thousands of lives.
</P>
<P>
   Honor guards and military bands marched and the crowd observed a
minute of silence for the dead at Anzac Cove, named after the
Australia and New Zealand Army Corps, whose soldiers came ashore on
the north coast of the Gallipoli peninsula on April 25, 1915.
</P>
<P>
   ''We shared the calamity of war,'' New Zealand Prime Minister
Helen Clark told the crowd. ''Things that happened here tied us
together forever. We share the grief of our losses.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's maintain our determination to keep the next generations
away from the terror of war,'' the Anatolia news agency quoted
Clark as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Australian Prime Minister John Howard and Turkish Forestry
Minister Nami Cagan represented their nations. Much of the crowd
was backpackers from Australia and New Zealand who came to honor
the volunteers from their countries who took the brunt of the blow
for the Allies.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel very sad,'' said Rachel Garrett, an audio visual
technician from London, as she overlooked the beach inside her
sleeping bag. ''The people who fell here made our history, but now
we have to look for peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Australian and New Zealand volunteers, known as ANZACs, formed
the backbone of a 200,000-man British-led army that landed at
Gallipoli in an attempt to capture Istanbul, 180 miles away. They
wanted to knock the German-allied Ottoman Empire out of the war and
open the Turkish straits to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 1 million men fought in the unsuccessful campaign,
which military historians call the first combined naval and land
operation of modern warfare. The Allies recorded 55,000 killed,
10,000 missing and 21,000 dead of disease, mainly dysentery.
Turkish casualties were estimated at 250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Many historians think that had the campaign succeeded, it would
have shortened the war by several years and slowed or prevented the
Bolshevik takeover in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But badly equipped, unprepared Turkish forces turned it into a
frustrating nine-month battle of attrition fought in a spectacular
clifftop setting. It was the only victory for the Turks in World
War I and provided the self-confidence they needed to salvage a
nation from the dismembered empire. The battle also gave them a war
hero -- Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who later established predominantly
Muslim Turkey as a secular republic with Western-style laws.
</P>
<P>
   Battlefields at the tip and the north of the Gallipoli Peninsula
have been turned into national parks that include dozens of
monuments and well-tended cemeteries.

<HEADLINE> Former BOCES treasurer charged with stealing nearly $3 million  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLONIE, N.Y. (AP) -- A former BOCES treasurer was accused of
embezzling more than $2.9 million dollars from his employer over
six years.
</P>
<P>
   John Hanna, 58, was arrested on charges of first-degree grand
larceny, falsification of business records and tampering with a
public record, all felonies.
</P>
<P>
   Hanna was treasurer for the Capital Region Board of Cooperative
Educational Services from 1982 until he retired last December.
Police in the Albany suburb of Colonie claim that since 1994, Hanna
diverted more than $2.9 million in checks to the BOCES corporation
into unauthorized accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ''He diverted those checks and deposited them into these
unauthorized BOCES accounts that none of the BOCES board of
directors knew about,'' Investigator Dave Lemerise said Tuesday at
a news conference announcing the arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Hanna would then draw money from those accounts, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Albany County District Attorney Sol Greenberg said the
investigation was continuing and that Hanna possibly could have
been embezzling funds before 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ''It may be the tip of the iceberg,'' Greenberg said,
</P>
<P>
   BOCES officials said they were shocked by the alleged
embezzlement, which was first noticed by Hanna's successor.
</P>
<P>
   BOCES is bonded against employee theft for up to $1 million. It
has taken steps to freeze the assets of Hanna and his family, said
district superintendent Barbara Nagler.
</P>
<P>
   ''We ultimately hope to recover all of the missing funds,''
Nagler said.
</P>
<P>
   Hanna was being held in the county jail pending a court
appearance Wednesday night. His lawyer, Phil Steck, said he had not
had the chance to look at the evidence in the case.
</P>
<P>
   BOCES districts are designed to provide support services to
local school districts, ranging from occupational training classes
to making sure eligible children are receiving social service
programs.

<HEADLINE> Hostages, Kidnappers Have Vanished  </HEADLINE>
By PAT ROQUE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISABELA, Philippines (AP) -- In this region shared by three
nations -- speckled with thousands of islands and crisscrossed by
traders, migrants, pirates and smugglers -- 21 hostages and the
armed assailants who kidnapped them have vanished.
</P>
<P>
   After a fruitless two-day international search, military
officials and Muslim rebel leaders said they remained unsure
Tuesday who abducted 21 people from a Malaysian resort and where
the hostages were taken.
</P>
<P>
   A small Philippine Muslim extremist group that is holding
hostages of its own claimed responsibility for the abductions from
Malaysia late Sunday, but later backed off, with a spokesman saying
he was unsure if the group was involved. Meanwhile, the search
continued in the seas among the southern Philippines and Malaysia
and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The kidnapping ordeal began Sunday night. Visitors to Sipadan
Island, one of the world's top diving resorts, saw their vacations
disintegrate into terror when six armed assailants stormed the
white-sand beaches, abducting 21 people, including at least 10
foreign tourists. An American couple, James and Mary Murphy of
Rochester, N.Y., escaped by refusing to swim out to the kidnappers'
boat and then hiding in bushes.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages include at least 10 foreigners from Germany,
France, South Africa, Finland and Lebanon. They also included a
Filipino worker and nine Malaysians, authorities said. The
nationality of the 21st hostage was not known.
</P>
<P>
   A Philippine police intelligence report said Tuesday that the
hostages had been taken on two fishing boats to Sulu province at
the Philippines' southern tip, about one hour away from Sipadan.
But Lt. Edgar Joseph Andres, whose navy plane conducted a
three-hour search of the sparsely inhabited area, said he saw no
signs of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Early Tuesday, the Abu Sayyaf -- the Muslim rebel group under
siege for holding 27 Filipinos hostage for five weeks -- claimed
responsibility. But later its spokesman, Abu Ahmad, said he was not
certain the group was involved.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't give you a right answer at this moment,'' he told a
radio station.
</P>
<P>
   A waitress who escaped the abduction added weight to the belief
that Muslim rebels were responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Jeneth Cagaanan, 27, said ''one of the pirates pointed a gun at
my neck'' and demanded her money and jewelry. She said she replied
to him in Tausug -- a language spoken in the southern Philippine
provinces of Tawi Tawi and Sulu -- and the assailants understood
her. But some of the gunmen spoke Malay, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cagaanan said one of the assailants wore a vest emblazoned with
the initials ''MNLF,'' an acronym for the Moro National Liberation
Front.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Philippines' largest Muslim rebel group, the MNLF
signed a peace accord in 1996. But some disgruntled members now
belong to other Muslim groups.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf are the smaller but more radical of two groups
fighting for an independent Islamic state in the predominantly
Roman Catholic Philippines. They have been blamed for numerous
attacks on Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Philippine Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado told reporters that
authorities had concluded nothing about the identities of the
abductors or the location of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that in due time, the kidnappers will emerge,
whether it is for political purposes or financial reasons,''
Mercado said.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Mamat Talib said five people were arrested and
interrogated in Sabah, a Malaysian state on northern Borneo, in
connection with the abductions. Police sources said some of those
arrested were former Sipadan resort employees. They were suspected
of knowing some of the gunmen or helping them.
</P>
<P>
   In the Philippines, meanwhile, troops pounded several Abu Sayyaf
camps with rockets Tuesday in an attempt to free the remaining
Filipino hostages, mostly schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the rebels announced that they had beheaded two of
their adult hostages. They have threatened to behead five more, if
the military does not halt the assault.
</P>
<P>
   The group has demanded freedom for three men jailed in the
United States, including Ramzi Yousef, mastermind of the 1993
bombing of the World Trade Center, and Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman,
accused of conspiring to blow up New York City landmarks.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- An obstetrician who claimed that a brain

has agreed to stop practicing medicine in exchange for probation.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alan Zarkin, 61, pleaded guilty Tuesday to assault. He will

<HEADLINE> Samsung Creditors OK Takeover  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- For the first time, a foreign carmaker
gained a foothold in South Korea, one of Asia's biggest auto
markets, in a takeover that could dent the power of this country's
top conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting in Seoul, Samsung Motors Inc.'s 16 creditor banks
on Tuesday ceded control of the bankrupt company to French carmaker
Renault in a $562 million deal that many analysts considered a
giveaway.
</P>
<P>
   Renault will get a 70.1 percent stake in Samsung Motors and an
infusion of its funds and expertise would put pressure on the
Hyundai business group, which commands more than 70 percent of the
domestic car market.
</P>
<P>
   But labor turmoil at a larger South Korean auto company, the
ailing Daewoo Motor Co., reflected uneasiness among some South
Koreans with the prospect of foreign ownership.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 Daewoo autoworkers sealed off their main plant in
Bupyong, 18 miles west of Seoul, after police raided the factory at
dawn and arrested 20 labor activists. All but seven were later
released.
</P>
<P>
   The raid followed more than two months of strikes by the plant's
7,500 workers to protest the planned sale of Daewoo to a foreign
investor. The government said the strikes were illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Dominated by family owned businesses, or chaebol, the South
Korean economy only began opening up in earnest to outside
investment two years ago, in line with reforms designed to cope
with the Asian currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Renault, which reached a tentative agreement to take over
Samsung in negotiations in Paris this past weekend, will gain
access to one of Asia's most closed markets. Consumers are expected
to benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is going to introduce more competition into the market so
companies will be keen on improving their customer service and
quality of their cars,'' said Han Kumhee, an analyst at Merrill
Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   It is rare to see a foreign car in the streets of Seoul, South
Korea's capital. During the economic crisis that hit the region in
1997, South Koreans responded enthusiastically to a government
campaign to buy Korean.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for a $58 billion rescue package from the
International Monetary Fund, the government relaxed restrictions on
foreign investors, weakening the grip of the powerful chaebol.
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean market had been controlled by three domestic
auto firms -- Hyundai, Kia Motor Co. and Daewoo. Nearly 1.3 million
cars were sold in South Korea in 1999, of which only 2,401 were
foreign-made.
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai Motor Co. took over Kia last year. Samsung, with a
capacity of 240,000 units a year, has a technical tie-up with
Nissan Motors Co. of Japan, in which Renault is the controlling
shareholder.

<HEADLINE> Primedia Loses $39 Million in 1st Q  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Primedia Inc., publisher of special-interest
magazines such as Modern Bride, lost $39.4 million for the first
three months of the year amid heavy spending on Internet
development efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The loss amounted to 35 cents per share, slightly more than the
34 cents a share expected by analysts, according to a survey by
First Call/Thomson Financial. In the same period a year ago, the
company lost $46 million or 41 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues slipped to $405 million from $411 million, although the
year-ago figure includes $33 million from an educational business
that was sold in late 1999. Excluding that business, revenues from
continuing operations rose 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Losses from Internet-based businesses widened to $14.9 million
during the latest quarter from $4.5 million in the year-ago
quarter, although revenues from those operations nearly doubled to
$8.8 million compared to $4.7 million in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Primedia has been aggressively expanding its Internet operations
under new chairman Tom Rogers, hiring managers and cutting numerous
deals with other media companies.
</P>
<P>
   Notably, the company also announced eight deals involving new
media on Tuesday, bringing to 29 the number of Internet alliances
Primedia has now forged.
</P>
<P>
   The deals include investments in three Internet companies and
arrangements with five others to provide promotion in Primedia's
magazines and other media outlets in exchange for equity stakes.
</P>
<P>
   In total, the 29 new media deals involve commitments from
Primedia of about $100 million, two-thirds of which is in non-cash
investments such as advertising space, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Primedia publishes about 200 special-interest magazines
including LowRider and Sail, as well as two regional magazines, New
York and Chicago.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Smith Continues Lonely Stand  </HEADLINE>
By HOLLY RAMER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Which came first: the plastic fetus, the
elephants or the egg?
</P>
<P>
   Those who have followed Sen. Bob Smith's career will have no
trouble identifying the props he has used to defend his passionate
positions.
</P>
<P>
   With his vocal advocacy for Elian Gonzalez's Miami relatives,
the 59-year-old New Hampshire Republican once again has taken an
unpopular position. And as usual, being in the minority has only
fueled his fervor.
</P>
<P>
   That a custody dispute in Florida is likely to have little
effect on his New Hampshire constituents does not deter the
two-term senator. Nor do polls that indicate most Americans believe
the boy should live with his father.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said Monday he will continue his efforts ''because it's
the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference the day the 6-year-old Cuban boy was
removed from his relatives' home, Smith had tears in his eyes as he
held a pink Easter egg the family had intended to give to Elian.
</P>
<P>
   That anguish turned to anger later Saturday when a reporter
asked him whether he had received campaign donations from
Cuban-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know what, with all due respect, I cannot believe that
you're asking me that question, I really can't. You make me sick!''
he bellowed. ''No, no, no. ... What a stupid question, and an
outrageous question at a time like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics among his constituents say Smith's behavior is
what's outrageous. In a letter to the Concord Monitor, Alan Lord of
Warner said Attorney General Janet Reno should have raided the
Senate to forcibly remove Smith and ''return him to his loving
circus family.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I was just embarrassed and somewhat dismayed to see our
senator in the national headlines again making outrageous
statements,'' Andrew Robertson of Deerfield said Tuesday. ''I'm a
New Hampshire native and always have been a Republican, but I
cannot for the life of me figure out how he gets elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith had his supporters in downtown Concord on Tuesday
afternoon, however. Deli manager Robert Cousins hasn't made up his
mind about the Elian issue but said Smith has a right to get
involved.
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as it's not taking away from what's important here, I
say go for it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's critics and supporters agree on one point: It's nothing
new for the senator to stand on his own.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was one of only five senators who voted against the 1991
Civil Rights Act, one of three who voted against the National
Energy Policy Act in 1992 and one of three to vote against
confirming the nomination of Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the Supreme
Court. He has voted against funding for Head Start, food stamps and
emergency aid for hurricane victims.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was right, and the other 93 senators were wrong,'' he said
about the civil rights vote.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, he faced ridicule for his one-man battle against
allowing elephants from a visiting circus on Capitol grounds. His
45-minute speech featured a photograph of a bloodied elephant that
was shot 100 times.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, he used a plastic fetus as a prop during a
graphic appeal to ban late-term abortions.
</P>
<P>
   And in a span of a few months last year, he ran for president,
dropped out of the Republican party, became an independent, ended
his presidential campaign and returned to the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is a Navy veteran who has led the effort to find missing
prisoners of war in Vietnam. Before his career in politics, he was
a teacher and a baseball coach, a school board chairman and owner
of a real estate agency.
</P>
<P>
   He was elected to the House in 1984 after two unsuccessful
campaigns and then was elected to the Senate in 1990. He narrowly
won re-election in 1996. He is chairman of the Environment and
Public Works Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said his decisions are aimed at making a difference beyond
whatever current controversy he steps into.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to be able to look at my grandchildren someday and
answer them when they say, 'Where were you when all this fell
apart?''' he said last summer. ''I want to be able to say I was
here, I stood up and I did the best I could.''

<HEADLINE> Volvo To Buy Renault Truck Division  </HEADLINE>
By CLAR NI CHONGHAILE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Sweden's AB Volvo and French carmaker Renault SA
will join together to create the world's second-largest
manufacturer of heavy trucks in a deal worth $1.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo will buy Renault's RVI truck division and its U.S.
subsidiary Mack Trucks Inc. in exchange for a 15 percent stake in
the Swedish firm, making Renault Volvo's biggest shareholder, the
companies said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Renault will buy an additional 5 percent of Volvo's shares on
the open market and hold its stake for at least three years, the
companies said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal with help Renault's RVI compete more effectively. Volvo
has been seeking a partner since European authorities blocked its
proposed $6.9 billion takeover of Swedish rival Scania last month.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel the combination has the scale, skill and resources ...
to be a truly competitive company,'' Volvo's chief executive, Leif
Johansson, told a joint news conference in Paris with Renault
chairman Louis Schweitzer.
</P>
<P>
   The combination demonstrates how higher research costs and
declining prices are pushing car manufacturers into each others'
arms.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which has to be approved by European and U.S.
antitrust authorities, would give Volvo a 25 percent share of the
European and American markets and a significant presence in Latin
America and Asia. Production is estimated at 165,000 trucks, each
weighing more than 5 tons.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mack is an ideal partner for continuing expansion of our North
American truck operations,'' Johansson told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The new company would be second only to DaimlerChrysler AG's
Mercedes Benz in heavy truck group rankings.
</P>
<P>
   ''When your competitors grow very large, you have to be able to
match that expansion in research and development. Competition is so
strong it is driving consolidation,'' Johansson said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is to be presented to Volvo shareholders for approval
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo and Renault are no strangers to each other. A proposed
merger fell through in 1993 in the face of opposition from Volvo
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Renault has been hungry for acquisitions. Last year, it took a
36.8 percent controlling stake in Japan's Nissan Motor Co. It
bought Romanian carmaker Dacia Automobile last July.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the creditors of Samsung Motors Inc. agreed to
Renault's $562 million takeover offer for the bankrupt South Korean
company. The deal makes Renault the first foreign car producer and
operator to set up in South Korea, a notoriously inaccessible but
lucrative market.
</P>
<P>
   Renault also announced Tuesday it will set up a sales subsidiary
in Japan and work with Nissan to boost sales in the world's
second-largest auto market.

<HEADLINE> Court Looking At Pinochet Case  </HEADLINE>
By EDUARDO GALLARDO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- On the eve of a crucial court session on
whether Gen. Augusto Pinochet should be immune from prosecution,
the former dictator said through an aide Tuesday that he had no
hand in killings during his regime.
</P>
<P>
   In a closed-door session Wednesday, the 21 judges of the
Santiago Court of Appeals are to receive the report of an
investigating judge who wants Pinochet's congressional immunity
lifted so he can face trial.
</P>
<P>
   According to a government report, 3,191 people were killed or
disappeared during Pinochet's 17 years in power. The outcome of the
proceeding could decide whether he eventually faces human rights
charges stemming from his 1973-1990 regime.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday and Friday, the judges are to hear arguments by
lawyers for Pinochet and the plaintiffs. Pinochet has immunity as a
senator-for-life, a post he created for himself in the constitution
written before he left power.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Pinochet defended himself through an associate.
After meeting with Pinochet, retired Gen. Luis Cortes said: ''He
told me: 'Please tell everybody that I never ordered anybody to be
killed or tortured.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Juan Guzman is the judge handling the 92 criminal
complaints against Pinochet -- some from individuals, some from
groups, including the Communist Party and various labor and
teachers' groups. Guzman wants to try the 84-year-old general in
one of the most emblematic cases of the military era: the so-called
''Caravan of Death.''
</P>
<P>
   The caravan was a group of military officers who toured several
Chilean cities by helicopter soon after the 1973 coup led by
Pinochet, dragging political prisoners from jail and executing
them. Seventy-five people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The city was calm ahead of the proceeding, but security had been
beefed up in anticipation of protests. Riot control barriers were
to be erected around the court, and police said supporters and foes
of Pinochet would be kept apart.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's defense is expected to be first based on his
declining health, and Pinochet's lawyers pressed the court Tuesday
to order medical tests on the general.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the plaintiffs said they expect Pinochet to lose his
immunity and for the trial to go forward. The appeals court's
decision can only be appealed by the defense in such a case.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet returned to Chile in March after being detained for 16
months in London, where he thwarted an attempt by a judge in Spain
who wanted to extradite him there for trial. He was released after
British doctors determined he was physically and mentally unfit for
trial, a finding supported by his doctors in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet himself, meanwhile, remained secluded at his
countryside home near Santiago.
</P>
<P>
   ''In London, he felt offended, insulted, but here he feels very
sad,'' said retired Gen. Cortes, one of Pinochet's closest aides.
''He feels he is not welcomed anywhere, that nobody loves him
anymore.''

<HEADLINE> Abortion Fight Back in Supreme Court  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the Supreme Court's most important abortion
case since 1992, six of the nine justices voiced concern Tuesday
over a Nebraska law, similar to those in 29 other states, banning a
surgical procedure opponents call ''partial-birth abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   The emotional issue of abortion returned to the nation's highest
court with noisy sidewalk demonstrations outside the courtroom
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ''The state interest here is drawing a bright line between
abortion and infanticide,'' Nebraska Attorney General Don Stenberg
argued in seeking reinstatement of a law that made it a crime for
doctors to perform partial-birth abortions.
</P>
<P>
   But Simon Heller, representing a Nebraska doctor, said none of
the state's purported interests ''is sufficient to override ... a
woman's interest in her health and bodily integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nebraska law, he said, is ''so broadly written it could
prohibit most second-trimester abortions'' and lead to making all
abortions ''more dangerous for women.''
</P>
<P>
   Questions and comments from two key justices -- Sandra Day
O'Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy -- indicated concern over the state
law's sweep.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor noted that the procedure Stenberg said was the target
of Nebraska's ban ''may be very similar to'' a type of abortion
used far more often.
</P>
<P>
   Partial-birth abortion is not a medical term. Doctors call the
method dilation and extraction, or D&AMP;X, because it involves
partially extracting a fetus, legs first, from the uterus into the
birth canal, where the skull is cut and its contents drained.
</P>
<P>
   A more common procedure is dilation and evacuation, or D&AMP;E, in
which an arm or leg of a live fetus may be pulled into the birth
canal during the abortion operation.
</P>
<P>
   Calling both methods ''gruesome,'' O'Connor asked Stenberg, ''Do
you take the position that the state of Nebraska could also
prohibit D&AMP;E abortions for pre-viability pregnancies?''
</P>
<P>
   When Stenberg said he did not take that position ''for purposes
of this case,'' O'Connor shot back, ''It is difficult to read the
statute and think that is so.''
</P>
<P>
   Justices David H. Souter, John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg
and Stephen G. Breyer seemed to doubt the Nebraska law's
constitutionality.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Antonin Scalia,
who along with Justice Clarence Thomas voted in 1992 to let states
ban all abortions, were clearly more sympathetic to the Nebraska
law.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia discussed the ''horror'' of D&AMP;X abortions, which he
repeatedly described as taking ''a living, unborn child'' from the
uterus and ''killing that unborn child.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1992 ruling -- the court's most recent major abortion
decision -- reaffirmed the core holding of the court's 1973 Roe vs.
Wade decision. That landmark ruling said women have a
constitutional right to end their pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   Led by O'Connor, Kennedy and Souter, the court said eight years
ago that states cannot impose any ''undue burden'' on that right.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska's law is not an undue burden, Stenberg said, no more
than Pennsylvania's 24-hour waiting period to get an abortion,
which the court approved in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   But Ginsburg interrupted to say Nebraska's law -- unlike the
waiting period -- is not aimed at protecting a woman's health or
fetal life. ''This law seems out of the bounds that this court has
set for pre-viability regulation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Past abortion rulings make clear that states can take numerous
steps to protect a viable fetus, one able to survive outside the
uterus. Viability generally occurs sometime around the sixth month
of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the court, anti-abortion and abortion-rights activists
braved a driving rainstorm as they tried to outdo each other with
signs and slogans. Police arrested 23 anti-abortion demonstrators
who ignored orders to remove signs that were larger than a federal
regulation allows.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision is expected by late June, but the debate
over partial-birth abortions already has played a role in
presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is asking the court to strike down
Nebraska's law. The president twice vetoed similar federal bans
enacted by Congress. In the presidential race, Democrat Al Gore
opposes bans on partial-birth abortion, but Republican George W.
Bush supports them.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-controlled House voted 287-141 three weeks ago to
outlaw partial-birth abortions -- the third time in five years such
a ban was backed. While the majority was wide enough to override
Clinton's promised veto, the bill's supporters again appear to be
short the two-thirds majority they would need to prevail in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska's law, along with those in Arkansas and Iowa, were
invalidated by a unanimous three-judge panel of the 8th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals. But a month later, another federal
appeals court upheld partial-birth abortion laws in Wisconsin and
Illinois.

<HEADLINE> Crime in Poland More Than Doubles  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- Poland's crime rate has more than doubled
since 1989, the year the communist government was toppled, the
Interior Ministry said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A ministry report suggested that one remedy would be for police
to stop investigating minor crimes where there is little chance of
finding the perpetrators, spokesman Marcin Trzcinski said. An
estimated 200,000 such cases occur annually.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is likely to meet with criticism from the public,
already irritated at the underfunded and understaffed police
force's reluctance to protect ordinary people in the street.
</P>
<P>
   Some 1.1 million crimes were committed last year in the nation
of 39 million people, a 104.8 percent from 10 years ago, Trzcinski
said. Perpetrators were found in only 45 percent of the cases.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is largely due to economic crimes such as fraud and
tax evasion that came with the switch to a market economy,
Trzcinski said by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   The report's other proposals to improve crime-fighting included
higher police pay and better equipment, he said.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends Up 229; Dow Up 218  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Bargain-hunting investors, enticed by a round of
strong corporate earnings reports, pounced on the technology sector
today, helping the Nasdaq composite index to its second biggest
point gain in history.
</P>
<P>
   The largest and best-established technology companies led the
gains, driving the Dow Jones industrial average to a healthy gain
of its own.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index rose 229.09 to close at 3,711.57,
more than wiping out Monday's 161.40-point loss. Just one week ago,
the Nasdaq notched its biggest point gain ever, rising 254.41
points.
</P>
<P>
   The increasingly volatile index has recorded its 10 biggest
point gains and its 10 biggest point losses since the start of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 218.72 to close at
11,124.82(AP) -- .
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The market's advance,
which came on steady volume with more stocks rising than falling,
heartened traders who have weathered a long string of chaotic
sessions this month.
</P>
<P>
   ''Earnings have been impressive and the economy is in good
shape,'' said Ned Collins, head of trading at Daiwa Securities
America. ''I'm not sure we're completely in the clear, but we were
due for a rally.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong earnings reports lured investors back to the technology
sector after Monday's selloff. Corning soared after reporting
first-quarter operating earnings of $178.1 million, or 64 cents a
share. Analysts had expected Corning to post operating earnings of
55 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has transformed its business in recent years
to focus on fiber optics, also released upbeat projections for the
remainder of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline.com, the name-your-price Internet company, said after
the close of trading Monday that its first-quarter loss was
narrower than expected and that sales surged more than 500 percent
compared with a year ago. Its shares rose today.
</P>
<P>
   Sapient, a technology consulting company, rose on the Nasdaq.
Two Wall Street brokerages raised their ratings on the stock after
the company reported robust profit growth.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which dominated Monday's technology selloff with its
16 percent decline, recovered some ground.
</P>
<P>
   ''Technology stocks have been sold down so sharply that some
investors believe it's bargain-hunting time in the tech and telecom
sectors,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock
&AMP; Co. ''It appears for now that many Nasdaq stocks are oversold.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some favorites that suffered in recent weeks bounced
back strongly. JDS Uniphase was up.
</P>
<P>
   After punishing selloffs earlier this month, the Nasdaq is now
nearly 27 percent below its all-time high of 5,048.62, reached
March 10. The Nasdaq is still down for the year, but it remains 43
percent above its level at this time last year.
</P>
<P>
   For today, at least, the technology companies that dominate the
Nasdaq were posting better earnings reports than the blue-chip Dow
components. Procter &AMP; Gamble fell steeply after saying earnings in
the third fiscal quarter fell 28 percent from a year ago because of
higher costs. The report confirmed Procter &AMP; Gamble's dour warning
in early March that sliced more than $35 billion from the company's
market value.
</P>
<P>
   The maker of Scotch tape and other products, 3M, also fell. The
company met earnings expectations, but warned that profit growth
for the full year may slow and is not likely to exceed analysts'
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's solid advance came from technology and financial
names. Intel and American Express rose.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Conference Board reported consumer confidence slipped
in April for the third consecutive month. The sign of ebbing
confidence may suggest to some investors that the exuberance that
drove the U.S. economy to an unprecedented growth spurt may be
ending. That could suggest that the Federal Reserve won't have to
dramatically raise interest rates to force a slowdown.

<HEADLINE> Report: U.S. Not Monitoring Fish  </HEADLINE>
By CAREN BENJAMIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is shirking its responsibility
to protect consumers -- particularly pregnant women and young
children -- from dangerous levels of mercury in fish, environmental
groups said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A report by the Vermont-based Mercury Policy Project, the Sierra
Club, California Communities Against Toxics and other groups found
that what little recent Food and Drug Administration data exists
shows possibly unsafe levels of mercury in tuna, swordfish and
shark.
</P>
<P>
   The group urged the FDA to resume testing mercury levels in
those heavily consumed species. The agency stopped limited testing
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should have that information to provide people so they can
make reasonable, informed choices,'' said Michael Bender, head of
the Mercury Policy Project and one of the report's authors.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury is a chemical element that also is a byproduct of
coal-fired power plants and trash incinerators. When ingested, it
can cause neurological damage. Fetuses and young children are
particularly vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA deems fish safe if they contain less one part per
million of mercury. The federal government's 1991 food fish survey
-- the most comprehensive recent study -- showed the most popular
species had substantially less mercury than that, said Dr. Gregory
Cramer, an FDA chemist.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no reason to believe that levels in the food supply
have dramatically changed from these historic levels,'' Cramer
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The question is: Do we want to spend taxpayer dollars to test
fish if we have no reason to believe the levels have changed?''
</P>
<P>
   But the environmental groups say the FDA's own data shows
dangerously high mercury levels in some fish checked after 1991.
Between 1992 and 1998, 36 percent of the swordfish samples taken
had unsafe mercury levels, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   The last time canned tuna was checked for mercury was 1995. Only
11 cans were sampled and 85 percent of them had mercury levels of
up to 0.3. Bender said the average American eats 10 cans of tuna
per year so the aggregate amount of mercury ingested could be
unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific studies are split on how much ingested mercury is
harmful to fetuses.
</P>
<P>
   ''One study says there is a problem, one says there isn't. The
Mercury Project believes it's better to err on the side of
caution,'' Bender said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who teamed last year with Sen. Tom
Harkin, D-Iowa, in asking the FDA to resume mercury testing, said
the findings ''argue strongly for continued monitoring to protect
our children.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Ignoring the problem certainly won't make it go away or
prevent the potential damage to human health from methlymercury in
seafood,'' Harkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Cramer said the FDA took no action following those results
because it was determined there was no health threat.
</P>
<P>
   ''This goes back to the basic principle of toxicology: The dose
makes the poison. It's not just the level of mercury but how often
people eat it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy and Harkin also questioned whether the FDA's one part per
million threshold is adequate, noting the Environmental Protection
Agency's benchmark is 10 times as stringent.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental groups said many states issue health alerts
for river, lake and noncommercial ocean fish that have mercury
levels half as great as the FDA standard.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Blasts Russia on Chechnya  </HEADLINE>
By NAOMI KOPPEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- The top U.N. human rights body accused Russia of
widespread violations in Chechnya in a sudden and unexpected show
of decisiveness Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution, sponsored by the European Union, attacked
''disproportionate and indiscriminate use of Russian military
force, including attacks against civilians.'' It also expressed
concern at ''serious crimes and abuses'' committed by Chechen
forces.
</P>
<P>
   The 53-nation Human Rights Commission called on the Russian
government to establish a commission of inquiry and asked a series
of U.N. human rights experts to undertake missions to Chechnya. But
it stopped short of demands by human rights organizations that the
world body set up its own probe.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution was approved by a vote of 25 to 7 with 19
abstentions. Joining Russia in voting against the resolution were
China, Cuba, the Republic of Congo, India, Madagascar and Sri
Lanka.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism of a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council
was an unusual move for the commission, which last week failed even
to vote on a motion attacking China's human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   The vote came after negotiations between the EU and the Russian
delegation failed to come up with an agreed statement. It took U.N.
officials by surprise. They had expected the debate to be adjourned
until Wednesday to allow discussions to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately the Russian Federation was not in a position to
accept the minimum that this commission must ask for when seriously
addressing human rights and international humanitarian law in
Chechnya,'' said Portuguese Ambassador Alvaro de Mendonca e Moura,
speaking for the EU.
</P>
<P>
   Russia sent troops into Chechnya for a second time last
September after militants based in the territory invaded the
neighboring region of Dagestan. Chechens also are blamed for four
apartment bombings in Russia in September that killed 300 people.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and the EU have been sharply critical of what
they call excessive use of force by Russian troops, widespread
civilian suffering, and reports of human rights abuses in the
campaign against Chechen separatists.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Ambassador Vasily Sidorov said the resolution failed to
take account of the serious danger to human rights posed by
terrorists in Chechnya. He said it showed ''absolutely no
understanding of what human rights means.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Armed bandits have unleashed a war against the whole peaceful
population of Chechnya,'' Sidorov said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
welcomed the decision and criticized Russia for blocking a unified
commission stand on Chechnya, spokesman James P. Rubin said. Rubin
said Chechnya is on the agenda for talks Russian Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov is having in Washington with President Clinton and
Albright.

<HEADLINE> Vermont Gay Union Bill Is Approved  </HEADLINE>
By ROSS SNEYD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- Lawmakers gave final approval Tuesday to
legislation making Vermont the first state to grant gay couples
nearly all of the rights and benefits of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The state House voted 79-68 for the ''civil unions'' bill, which
was approved by the Senate last week. Democratic Gov. Howard Dean
said he will sign it, possibly as soon as Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the powerful message is that in Vermont, we tend to
value people for who they are, not what they are,'' Dean said.
</P>
<P>
   Three homosexual couples and their lawyers, who sued in 1997
when they were denied marriage licenses, watched in the crowded
House chamber as the final roll was called.
</P>
<P>
   Stacy Jolles and Nina Beck stood cradling their 5-month-old son,
Seth. Peter Harrigan stood embracing Stan Baker, who held a small
necklace from which his parents' wedding rings dangled. And Holly
Puterbaugh held hands with Lois Farnham, who wiped tears from her
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ''This isn't marriage, but it's a huge and powerful bundle of
rights that we've finally gotten,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill came about after the Vermont Supreme Court unanimously
ruled in December that gay couples were being unconstitutionally
denied the rights and benefits of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The court gave the Legislature time to decide whether to let
gays marry or to create some kind of domestic partnership.
Lawmakers opted for a parallel system for homosexuals, creating
what they called civil unions.
</P>
<P>
   After the bill takes effect July 1, couples will be able to go
to their town clerks for licenses. Then they will have their unions
certified by a justice of the peace, judge or member of the clergy.
</P>
<P>
   Breakups will be handled in Family Court, just as divorces are,
although they will be called dissolutions.
</P>
<P>
   The more than 300 benefits that the state confers on married
couples now will flow to same-sex couples, including the ability to
make medical decisions on behalf of partners, inherit from each
other without hefty taxes, and protection from having to testify
against one another.
</P>
<P>
   But there are responsibilities as well. For example, same-sex
partners will have to assume each other's debt and pay child
support.
</P>
<P>
   Civil unions will not entitle couples to benefits bestowed by
the federal government in areas such as Social Security and
immigration. And most states will probably not recognize civil
unions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no state has ever gone so far in recognizing gay
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this definitely places Vermont in the forefront in
this country, places Vermont on par with Nordic and European
countries and Canada,'' said Beth Robinson, a lawyer who argued the
gay couples' case before the Vermont Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents in the Legislature said they were being asked to grant
special rights to people whose lifestyles they could not support.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this bill passes, this day shall live in infamy throughout
the country and throughout the world. This is against natural
law,'' said Republican Rep. Henry Gray.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters argued that traditional marriages between men and
women would not be undermined if gays were granted the same rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''May we be the last generation of gay and lesbian Vermonters
who have formed our committed relationships without the possibility
of a law that grants us our rights, benefits and
responsibilities,'' said Rep. William Lippert, the only openly gay
member of the Legislature.

<HEADLINE> Croatia Ousts Intelligence Head  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- Croatia's president on Tuesday replaced
the head of the military counterintelligence service, removing a
mainstay of late President Franjo Tudjman's rule.
</P>
<P>
   President Stipe Mesic ousted Zarko Pesa and appointed Davor
Biscan to head the Security-Information Service, or SIS, which
functions within the defense ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman's critics had claimed for years that he and his
associates were using the SIS and other intelligence agencies to
maintain their grip on power and denounce their political
opponents. Independent media have often reported alleged abuses of
secret services by Tudjman's party.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Parliament investigated allegations that one of
Tudjman's aides used the military counterintelligence service to
try to tarnish the image of Tudjman's opponents in the media. The
investigation found no proof of the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the weekly Nacional accused another intelligence
agency of using compromising files to make sure soccer referees
ruled in favor of Tudjman's favorite team in the national soccer
league championship.
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman died in December after leading Croatia for almost a
decade. Mesic succeeded him in February, a month after the
pro-Western coalition won parliamentary elections and ended
Tudjman's party's rule.

<HEADLINE> Reno Gets Flowers For Elian Decision  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno has gotten dozens
of bouquets and thousands of calls of support for reuniting Elian
Gonzalez with his father.
</P>
<P>
   The office of Reno's secretaries was a riot of color and smelled
like a florist shop as more than 50 bouquets, vases, boxes of
flowers and other floral arrangements arrived by midday Tuesday
with more on the way in. Every open, flat surface and most of the
floor was covered with flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ''On my God, I can't believe this,'' Reno said when she returned
from a day of meetings on Capitol Hill and at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Justice Department received 12,874 calls about
the case. Department officials did not have an exact breakdown but
spokeswoman Carole Florman said they were mainly supportive. Some
600 calls came directly into the attorney general's office that day
and they ran 9-1 in favor of Reno's action.
</P>
<P>
   One large mixed bouquet carried this card: ''God bless you. You
did the right thing both morally and psychologically for this
child. Marie DuMaine, licensed clinical social worker. Metairie,
La.''
</P>
<P>
   Another signed by three members of the Cuban-American League
said, ''Congratulations on a job well done.''
</P>
<P>
   The card with a small bouquet read: ''We strongly support you.
The staff and management of the Watergate Florist.''
</P>
<P>
   A card signed ''a friend in Miami, Kathleen,'' read: ''To thank
you and congratulate you on having the courage to make a difficult
decision. May God bless you.''

<HEADLINE> Report Documents Racial Disparities  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN, AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A black youth is six times more likely to be
locked up than a white peer, even when charged with a similar crime
and when neither has a prior record, says a new civil rights report
contending racial bias exists at every step of the juvenile justice
process.
</P>
<P>
   Many policies and practices have led to a ''cumulative
disadvantage'' for black and Latino youth, civil rights leaders and
youth advocates said Tuesday as they released the report by the
Youth Law Center. The National Council on Crime and Delinquency, a
criminal justice think tank, did the research.
</P>
<P>
   Minority youth are more likely than white youth who commit
comparable crimes to be referred to juvenile court, be detained,
face trial as adults, and be jailed with adults, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is astounding our nation can tolerate such gross
inequality,'' said William Spriggs, director of research and public
policy for the Urban League. ''We cannot have a justice system that
works this way.''
</P>
<P>
   The report comes at a time when high-profile violence -- like
Monday's shooting of several youth following a scuffle at the
National Zoo's annual black family celebration -- is driving harsher
juvenile punishment even as the rate of crime by young people
decreases.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, 47 states have expanded their laws to punish more
juveniles as adults not only for murder but also for drug crimes,
weapons possession and burglary. The report calls for states to
stop incarcerating young people with adults, noting three in four
youths imprisoned with adults are minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're taking youngsters, children, and putting them in the
worst location,'' Spriggs said. ''It reverses a long trend in
American policy not to have children imprisoned with hardened adult
criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers used data from state and federal arrest records,
juvenile court actions, detention, waivers to adult court and
incarceration.
</P>
<P>
   They found, for example, that black youth are 15 percent of the
population under 18 but comprise one-third of youth referred to,
formally processed by and convicted in juvenile court.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks also account for 40 percent of the youths sent to adult
courts and 58 percent of the youths sent to adult prison, said the
report, ''And Justice For Some.'' The Urban League and other civil
rights groups joined in its release.
</P>
<P>
   Figures for Latino youth may be understated because most state
court and prison records designate them as white, said Brent
Wilkes, executive director of the League of United Latin American
Citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The groups nonetheless praised the comprehensive report -- which
followed several recent juvenile justice studies -- as hard evidence
of something they've long suspected: minority youth are victims of
racial bias built into the justice system.
</P>
<P>
   Even when types of crime were considered, minorities were more
likely to go to jail or prison. Among youth with no prior record
arrested for violent crimes, including murder, rape and robbery,
137 out of every 100,000 blacks were incarcerated, compared with 15
out of every 100,000 whites.
</P>
<P>
   For drug offenses, which can carry a wide range of penalties,
the number was 48 for black youth and only 1 out of 100,000 for
whites.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the skewed numbers could mean simply that black
teens and children are committing more crimes or more serious
crimes. Researchers admit determining that is ''much more
complicated.'' But they maintained that many policies discriminate
against low-income youth -- who are overwhelmingly minority, from
single-parent homes or in foster care.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously racial profiling, targeting patrols in certain
low-income neighborhoods and racial bias within the justice system
contributes significantly to the stark disparities confirmed in
this report,'' said Hilary O. Shelton, Washington bureau director
for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
   The groups said Congress should give the Justice Department at
least $100 million to study and fix racial disparities. It should
also keep requiring states that get federal juvenile justice grants
to address the issue, said Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va., a member of the
House Judiciary Committee, which oversees most juvenile justice
laws and programs.
</P>
<P>
   That requirement is missing from a Senate version of the
juvenile justice bill held up by gun-control disputes, Scott said.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Clinton Differ on Elian Tactic  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore said Tuesday he disagreed
with his administration's decision to forcibly remove Elian
Gonzalez from Miami and reunite him with his father.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would have handled it differently,'' the Democratic
presidential candidate said of Saturday's raid by armed federal
agents on the Miami home of the 6-year-old Cuban boy's relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential rival George W. Bush, meanwhile, said
the Clinton administration should try to persuade the boy's father
to stay and raise his son in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with National Public Radio, Gore said, ''The
outcome in a family court proceeding in circumstances like this is
usually that the surviving parent is of course given custody.
</P>
<P>
   ''But if there are unusual circumstances, what's the best
interest of the child dictate otherwise, due process normally
requires that that be taken into account,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is why I recommended a different course of action five
months ago and as I have said I would have preferred to do it -- to
handle it -- in a different way.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that father and son have been reunited, Bush said: ''I would
hope that the administration would explain to the father that if he
so chooses he can raise his son in freedom, that the father can
stay here in the United States of America.''
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has ruled that Elian
belongs with his father, who wants them to return to Cuba. The
boy's Miami relatives are fighting that decision in federal court.
A federal court has said Elian must stay in the United States until
the court decides whether he can be granted political asylum over
his father's objections.

<HEADLINE> GM Announces $1.5B Saturn Expansion  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN HYDE, AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- The Saturn division of General Motors Corp. will
add two models to its lineup, including a small sport utility
vehicle, and get $1.5 billion to expand its factory in Spring Hill,
Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing its plans for Saturn on Tuesday, GM also said that
a future Saturn model would be the first GM product to use a Honda
engine, and that all Saturns would get more stylish exteriors.
</P>
<P>
   ''The investment that GM is willing to put into the Saturn brand
is a vote of confidence that in the long term Saturn has high
equity for GM,'' said Cynthia Trudell, Saturn's president.
</P>
<P>
   The Saturn line that GM started from scratch in 1990 for $5
billion has flagged in recent months as consumers have shied away
from its aging small cars. Saturn's LS midsize sedan has not lived
up to early expectations, and Saturn has cut production while
increasing advertising and offering better financing deals.
</P>
<P>
   But after limiting the division to just two small car models for
several years, GM has shown a renewed interest in Saturn. Saturn
buyers tend to be new to GM products, and Saturn says a large
majority of its customers would have bought Japanese or European
cars.
</P>
<P>
   Trudell said the Spring Hill plant would get a $1 billion
expansion to handle the new SUV model and the next generation of
the company's S-series small coupe and sedan. GM also will spend
$500 million on a 450,000-square foot addition and machinery to
build a new line of 4-cylinder engines for use in Saturns and other
GM cars.
</P>
<P>
   Trudell said the new powertrain assembly would employ between
600 and 800 workers, and replace the current line that uses about
1,500 workers to build engines and transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   She said most or all the workers who are not needed on the new
powertrain line would be shifted over to assembling new models, but
said it was unclear whether any workers would be idled.
</P>
<P>
   The new SUV will be a small model with an optional V6 to compete
with the Honda CRV, Toyota RAV4 and the Ford Escape.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the SUV, Saturn will get another model that Trudell
said would be chosen from four to six options under review. That
model will be powered by a Honda V6 engine, and would likely be the
first fruit of an agreement GM made with Honda last year to buy
engines from the Japanese automaker.
</P>
<P>
   Trudell said the deal was good for Saturn, even though Honda is

lead in that,'' Trudell said.

<HEADLINE> Grains Advance on Dry Weather  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain prices rose Tuesday on the Chicago Board of
Trade, driven by concerns that the continuing dry-weather outlook
for the Midwest could limit corn yields. Soybeans were little
changed.
</P>
<P>
   A spate of recent rains had washed away some worries about
abnormally dry soil conditions. But the return of sunny, mild
weather to key growing regions, and new forecasts for more of the
same in the next six to 10 days, revived prices.
</P>
<P>
   Fears that dryness could particularly harm the corn crop in the
western Midwest underpinned corn's rally, traders said.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat benefited from the rise in corn prices and a small decline
in the amount of winter wheat acreage rated in good to excellent
condition by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Soybeans dipped late in the session, wiping out small gains, on
a drop in soyoil.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for July delivery rose 2 cents to $2.65 a bushel; July
corn rose 2} cents to $2.39{ a bushel; July oats rose { cent to
$1.23} a bushel; July soybeans fell { cent to $5.56{ a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Beef futures advanced in trading on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, while pork futures retreated.
</P>
<P>
   June live cattle rose .38 cent to 69.65 cents a pound; May
feeder cattle rose .10 cent to 84 cents a pound; June lean hogs
fell .12 cent to 77.35 cents a pound; May pork bellies fell .55
cent to 97.10 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> US To Attend World Racism Conference  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States will participate in a world
conference on racism next year in South Africa, but some members of
civil rights and social justice groups say the U.S. role in the
event is far from being defined.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations World Conference Against Racism, Racial
Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance is scheduled for
August or September 2001. A planning conference will be held next
week in Geneva. Regional planning sessions are scheduled later in
Brazil, Senegal, France and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of people, including people in the U.S.
government and Congress, who wonder about these U.N. conferences
and what it is that they do,'' said Ambassador Betty King, the U.S.
representative on the U.N. Economic and Social Council in New York.
''The ultimate purpose is to have the entire world focused on the
question of racism in all its forms across the world. There is
value to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Only seven months remain in President Clinton's presidency, yet
White House deputy chief of staff Maria Echaveste said Tuesday at a
White House briefing that administration officials thought the
conference was a logical extension of the president's race
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   She said the administration wants the conference to show that
the United States is an active participant in global discussions
about race. But after the briefing, some representatives of groups
that work on issues, such as racial profiling, youth violence, hate
crimes, police brutality, anti-Semitism, torture and human rights,
expressed frustration, saying the U.S. objectives at the conference
are unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is the purpose of the conference? The preplanning
meetings? What is it to lead to? I haven't the slighest idea,''
said Brian Foss with the National Conference for the Community and
Justice in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Morton Sklar, director of the World Organization Against Torture
USA, said the members of the groups have decided to meet on May 18
in Washington to figure out how they can take a more active role in
the conference planning.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Wareham, international secretary general of the
International Association Against Torture in New York, chided the
administration for failing to issue its long-awaited report on
race. And he complained that the briefing for the U.N. conference
should have been held at least a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   He said the United States initially opposed a world conference
on racism, possibly because the U.S. government doesn't want to see
the nation's racial problems discussed in a global forum.
</P>
<P>
   ''The U.S. is the beacon of human rights observers and we can
dictate to the rest of the world,'' Wareham said. ''Racism is an
issue that puts the U.S. in the same category of other nations. It
makes the U.S. vulnerable.''

<HEADLINE> Falun Gong member wins asylum in New Jersey  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service has granted asylum to a member of the Falun Gong sect,
showing a new level of acceptance for asylum bids by people who
fear persecution in China for following the banned spiritual
movement.
</P>
<P>
   An INS officer approved M. Zeng's request for political asylum
after an April 10 hearing in which the 77-year-old doctor told
officers he would likely be imprisoned if forced to return to
China.
</P>
<P>
   Although immigration courts in San Francisco and New York
granted separate asylum requests to Falun Gong members last year,
immigration lawyers say this is the first time the INS itself has
taken such an action.
</P>
<P>
   The INS ''has now demonstrated that the United States is ready
to recognize the atrocities being perpetrated by the People's
Republic of China upon its people,'' said Zeng's attorney, Andrew
Bayne. ''This landmark decision ... shows that the United States
government will not stand by while innocents are oppressed
abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeng, whose first name and hometown were withheld by Bayne, came
with his wife last September to visit his daughter in Edison and
stayed after learning that China had stepped up its crackdown on
Falun Gong members.
</P>
<P>
   Police in Beijing detained dozens of members of the meditation
sect on Tuesday, the anniversary of a demonstration by 10,000 Falun
Gong followers near Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Chinese government has outlawed Falun Gong,
detained 35,000 followers and sent 5,000 without a trial to labor
camps, human rights groups say. Sixteen followers have died in
custody, the groups say.
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong is a movement based on meditation, slow-motion
exercises and the ideas of founder Li Hongzhi, a former government
grain clerk who now lives in New York. Followers say it promotes
health and good citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government says Falun Gong is an evil cult that
threatened public order and Communist Party rule and has caused
1,559 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration lawyers say more Chinese in recent months have
claimed Falun Gong membership as their reason for seeking asylum.
</P>
<P>
   ''I turn down at least three cases a week,'' said New York
attorney H. Raymond Fasano. He said he has 30 active case files of
Falun Gong members. The New Jersey ruling, he said, could lead to
the INS creating a new ground for seeking asylum, allowing members
to ''claim Falun Gong.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeng, who applied for asylum in January, was successful in
proving his case to an INS asylum officer because of his specific
knowledge of the movement's practices, said Bayne. Many of the
recent applications have been fraudulent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's basically the asylum claim du jour,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   INS asylum officer Susan Raufer's letter to Zeng, dated April 14
and received on Tuesday by Bayne, says that his approval is pending
a federal investigation of his background and required him and his
wife to obtain green cards. Zeng's wife received derivative asylum
as his spouse.
</P>
<P>
   Raufer declined comment on the case Tuesday, saying all asylum
matters are confidential. She said she doesn't know how many Falun
Gong members have recently applied for asylum in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Zeng, who spent two years as a political prisoner in the early
1970s for what his government called anti-revolutionary behavior,
declined comment on the ruling through his attorney. His family is
''extremely relieved,'' Bayne said.
</P>
<P>
   In November, a San Francisco immigration judge granted a Chinese
detainee asylum based on her fears of persecution because of her
Falun Gong membership. Also that month, a New York immigration
judge granted asylum to 17-year-old Chen Rong, who participated in
a June rally in China in support of the movement.

<HEADLINE> International Paper To Buy Champion  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Shares of Champion International Corp. jumped 24
percent Tuesday after International Paper Co. made a surprise $6.2
billion cash-and-stock takeover offer.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected bid comes two months after Champion agreed to be
acquired by Finnish paper company UPM-Kymmene for about $5 billion
in stock. UPM-Kymmene's stock has fallen about 20 percent since
February, when the deal was announced, making the terms much less
attractive for Champion shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do believe UPM may look at revising its bid,'' said Frances
Loo, an analyst with Warburg Dillon Read, adding, ''I don't think
this is fully played out.''
</P>
<P>
   International Paper is offering $43 in cash plus $19.59 in its
own stock for each share of Champion, valuing the company at $62.59
a share.
</P>
<P>
   That is 13 percent higher than UPM's all-stock offer for
Champion, which is currently worth about $55.47 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Loo said International Paper's offer is more attractive, not
only because it offers cash, but also because Champion's U.S.
shareholders would be getting stock in a domestic company.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some (institutional investors) won't be able to own the
Finnish share. It may not meet their investment criteria,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Champion chairman Richard Olson, IP chairman John
Dillon called his company's bid a ''superior offer'' and urged
Champion's board to authorize management to enter talks ''as soon
as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   International Paper's headquarters in Purchase, N.Y., is just a
few miles from Champion's corporate offices in Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many of us have enjoyed close friendships with Champion
employees at all levels over many years,'' Dillon said in the
letter. He also said he did not anticipate any regulatory hurdles
to the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Champion released a statement Tuesday morning saying its board
of directors would ''consider the proposal and respond as
appropriate.'' In Helsinki, UPM released a statement saying it
would ''consider the situation'' created by the rival bid from IP.
</P>
<P>
   If Champion walks away from the UPM deal, it will have to pay
UPM a $200 million breakup fee.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Champion rose $12.56\ to $64 on the New York Stock
Exchange, where International Paper's stock fell 7 percent, or by
$2.75, to $37.25. UPM's American depositary shares rose 5 percent,
or by $1.37{ to $27.87{, also on the Big Board.
</P>
<P>
   IP said it expected that a merger with Champion would result in
annual cost savings of $425 million as manufacturing operations are
consolidated, and overhead costs are cut, mainly in North America.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a good overlap in terms of product lines and geography,''
said Loo. In addition, she noted, International Paper has coveted
Champion's Brazilian operations.
</P>
<P>
   International Paper currently makes about 3.4 million tons of
white office paper annually, about 8.7 percent of the world's
supply and about 22 percent of U.S. capacity. With the acquisition
of Champion, International Paper's capacity would grow 50 percent,
giving it about 13 percent of the world's capacity and more than 25
percent of U.S. capacity.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition would give International Paper's 15 million
acres of timberland, about double its current holding.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam War Remains To Be ID'd  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A U.S. military honor guard in Hanoi on
Tuesday loaded an American cargo plane with six caskets believed to
be the remains of U.S. servicemen killed in the Vietnam War,
including bone fragments recovered from an excavation site that
Defense Secretary William Cohen visited in March.
</P>
<P>
   The remains will be flown to the Army's Central Identification
Laboratory in Hawaii for positive identification.
</P>
<P>
   There are nearly 2,000 American servicemen unaccounted for from
the war.
</P>
<P>
   On his Vietnam trip last month, Cohen was shown an excavation
site about 20 miles southwest of Hanoi where teams of Vietnamese
workers and U.S. forensic specialists were scooping up buckets of
muddy earth in search of remains from Navy Cmdr. Richard N. Rich,
whose F-4B Phantom jet was shot down on May 19, 1967.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, only two small bone fragments had been found, and
officials said they could not be sure they were human. They also
recovered thousands of tiny scraps of wiring and metal from the
Phantom jet.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Greer, a spokesman for the Pentagon office that
specializes in POW-MIA matters, said Tuesday that the Rich
excavation site was closed down on March 22, nine days after Cohen
was there. He said Vietnamese and U.S. officials agreed there was
sufficient evidence that the bones were human, although it remains
to be seen whether the Hawaii laboratory will be able to establish
positive identification.
</P>
<P>
   During Cohen's visit, Rich's son, Christopher Rich, of Augusta,
Ga., said in a telephone interview that he had been told in 1997
the Pentagon was closing his father's case without recovering his
remains. He said that after he and others petitioned to have the
case reopened, the Pentagon began working on it again.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Bacon, spokesman for Cohen, said the search for the
exact site where Rich's plane went down -- in a vast expanse of rice
paddies -- was helped by the fact that Rich's co-pilot survived the
crash and was repatriated after the war. ''He had a pretty good
idea of where the plane went down,'' Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   Greer said the names of the five other servicemen whose remains
are believed to be contained in the caskets flown out of Hanoi on
Tuesday are being withheld until their relatives have been
notified.

   Gates: Microsoft Must Remain Intact
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. chairman Bill Gates said today
that future products, and therefore consumers, would suffer if the
company is broken up by the federal government. In an interview
with The Associated Press, Gates said new versions of the Windows
operating system, the software that powers the vast majority of the
world's personal computers, would be stunted if the Windows or
Office software divisions were split from the rest of the company.
He said there wouldn't be a Windows today if it hadn't been for the
two groups working together. Gates spoke by telephone from a
computer hardware developers' conference in New Orleans. A breakup
of Microsoft is one of a number of possibilities being studied by
the federal government and 19 states in the antitrust case against
the software maker. Microsoft stock was at 69], up 2}.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Gives More Stock Options
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft employees will receive a new bundle of
stock options at yesterday's low closing price of 66|, a move
designed to offset the stock's poor performance on Wall Street in
recent weeks. In an internal e-mail obtained by The Associated
Press, Microsoft's chief executive, Steve Ballmer, told all company
employees they would receive an additional stock option grant equal
to any previous grants they had received since last July. Under the
new plan, employees will be granted options to buy stock at
Monday's 4 p.m. closing price on the Nasdaq Stock Market and the
company's lowest closing price in the past year.

   Consumer Confidence Slips in April
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Consumer confidence weakened in April for the
third consecutive month, suggesting that there could be some
slowing in the robust spending that has fueled U.S. economic
growth. The Conference Board said today its confidence index
registered 136.9 in April, down from 137.1 in March. However, the
figures were better than expected and expectations for future
business and job opportunities are still strong. Economists say
they believe interest rates may be raised in May to curbv any
inflation pressures. In another development, the National
Association of Realtors reported that sales of existing
single-family homes rose in March for the second month in a row, up
1.5 percent to a seasonably adjusted rate of 4.83 million units. In
February, sales were up by nearly 7 percent.

CompuBank to expand the site to include full-serving banking. GE
Financial Network, www.gefn.com, came online in February. The site

checking, savings and money market accounts, write checks and
access funds through automated teller machines, and other banking

   Oil Co. Earnings Beat Forecasts
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Three of the nation's biggest oil companies
reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings today, with
the surge in crude oil prices over the last year a big factor.
Exxon Mobil Corp., Texaco Inc. and Conoco Inc. profits all topped
Wall Street analysts' estimates for the quarter. Exxon Mobil earned
$3.35 billion, or 95 cents a share, up from $1.61 billion, or 46
cents, a year ago. Revenue was up 42 percent to $55.08 billion.
Texaco earned $602 million, or $1.10 a share, compared with $105
million, or 18 cents a share, a year ago. Revenues were $11.27
billion, up from $7.19 billion a year ago. Conoco reported net
income before special items of $391 million, or 62 cents per
diluted share, compared with $83 million, or 13 cents per diluted
share a year ago. Revenues for the quarter were $8.69 billion, up
from $5.34 billion last year.

<P>
   CBS Has High Sales But Loses $38M
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS Corp. reported big gains in revenues and
operating profits for its first quarter today but still posted a
net loss because of $75 million in expenses related to developing
its Internet operations. CBS, which is nearing completion of its
acquisition by MTV owner Viacom Inc., had a net loss of $38
million, or 5 cents a share, beating analyst expectations of a loss
of 7 cents per share. In the same period a year ago, CBS had net
income of $387 million, which included a gain of $366 million from
sales of various assets. Not counting that gain or other one-time
items, CBS had income from continuing operations of $25 million or
4 cents a year ago. Revenues jumped 36 percent to $2.40 billion.

<P>
   Bell Atlantic Matches Expectations
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- SBC Communications topped expectations with a 12
percent gain in first-quarter operating profits, while Bell
Atlantic's 10 percent gain met most forecasts for that local phone
company's first quarter as a long distance provider. Wireless
revenues rose sharply again at both Baby Bells as they continued to
move away from their longtime dependence on the local calling
business. SBC, the local phone company for most of the Southwest
and Midwest, said it earned $1.9 billion or 56 cents per share in
the first three months of the year, excluding various factors.
SBC's revenues grew 8 percent to $12.5 billion compared with the
year ago tally of $11.8 billion. Data-related revenues Bell
Atlantic's operating profit totaled $1.27 billion, or 80 cents a
share, in the first quarter. An accounting charge of $536 million
left a net profit of $731 million or 46 cents a share.

   China To Help Web Surfers

Web-surfing by mobile phone. Wireless Internet in China still faces
a thicket of technical and commercial obstacles, but in a country
with 50 million cell phones and Internet use doubling every six

<HEADLINE> West Nile prevention effort underway in 17 states  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHESDA, Md. (AP) -- Concerned that the West Nile virus that
killed seven in the New York City area last summer may strike again
this year, federal officials said Tuesday they are working with 17
states to head off an outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Ostroff, West Nile coordinator for the federal Centers
for Disease Control, said surveillance of mosquitos and birds that
carry the virus is underway in 17 states along the Atlantic
seaboard and the Gulf of Mexico. Humans may contract the virus when
they are bitten by an infected mosquito.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are concerned that birds from the Northeast may have
spread the virus, a form of encephalitis, when they migrated south
for the winter. An infected dead bird was found in Baltimore, the
only bird with the virus to be found outside the New York City
area, Ostroff said.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC provided the 17 states and two cities considered at risk
with $2.7 million to create surveillance programs.
</P>
<P>
   States and cities targeted by the CDC are: Alabama, Connecticut,
District of Columbia, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana,
Massachusetts, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, Maryland, New York, New
York City, New Jersey, North Carolina, Rhode Island, South
Carolina, Texas and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nita Lowey, a Westchester Democrat on the House
Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the CDC, is asking for
another $5 million to combat the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Most people who become infected either show no reaction or
become mildly ill with flu-like symptoms. Fatalities are rare. The
most vulnerable are the elderly and those with immune deficiencies.
In those people, the virus can cause the brain lining to swell.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials who were caught off guard by the outbreak last
year in New York City said they are better prepared this time
around.
</P>
<P>
   ''In many of the areas that were involved in the outbreak last
year ... there are intense prevention efforts underway,'' Ostroff
said at a lengthy briefing on the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the full reach of the virus will likely not be known
until mosquitos stir from hibernation in the coming weeks.
Researchers have already detected it in some hibernating mosquitos
in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   And a CDC survey of some 600 people in the Whitestone
neighborhood in Queens -- one of the most severely affected areas
during last year's outbreak -- found that 2.5 percent of the
residents were infected with the virus, Ostroff said. Health
officials tested residents' blood.
</P>
<P>
   Although the chances of becoming seriously ill from the virus
are low, officials are still suggesting that people in at-risk
states wear insect repellant and eliminate pools of stagnant water
that are breeding grounds for mosquitos.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Johnson of the Environmental Protection Agency also
suggested that communities use larvicides that kill mosquito
larvae. Larvicides are already being used in New York City. They
pose less risk to humans than pesticides, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Mass spraying of malathion, which was used last year in New York
City, should be used only as a last resort, he said.

<HEADLINE> Reebok Reports Sharp Rise in Profit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOUGHTON, Mass. (AP) -- Reebok International on Tuesday reported
strong profits in the first quarter despite a drop in sales.
</P>
<P>
   The athletic apparel and footwear maker reported earnings of
$31.7 million, or 56 cents a share, for the three months ended
March 31. That was up from $17.9 million, or 32 cents a share, a
year earlier and far exceeded the 35 cent estimate from analysts
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   The company credited cost-cutting measures.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody forecast it to be such a strong quarter for them,''
said Bob Drbul, equity analyst at Lehman Brothers in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Sales for the quarter were $769.8 million, down 2 percent from
sales of $785.8 million a year earlier. The company blamed the
decline, in part, on weakness in the Euro currency.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. sales fell 3 percent to $258.2 million from $266.3 million.
Sales of the company's Rockport subsidiary fell slightly, to $101
million in this year's first quarter from $109.7 million a year
earlier. But sales in the company's Ralph Lauren Footwear division
rose slightly to $27.3 million from $24.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Drbul said overall sales mattered less than improving
profitability at the company, which announced plans in September to
lay off 10 percent of its 6,600 employees around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's been a focus for the company -- to try to improve
operating margins,'' he said. ''This is a big step in doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Fireman, chairman and chief executive, said the
first-quarter results bode well for the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are starting to generate some positive energy in the U.S.
market, and I believe we're laying the foundation for future
growth,'' Fireman said.
</P>
<P>
   Reebok's shares rose Tuesday $1.50, or nearly 9 percent, to
$18.25 at 5 p.m. EDT on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Bell Atlantic Matches Expectations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- SBC Communications topped expectations with a 12
percent gain in first-quarter operating profits, while Bell
Atlantic's 10 percent gain met most forecasts for that local phone
company's first quarter as a long distance provider.
</P>
<P>
   Internet, data and wireless revenues rose sharply again at both
Baby Bells as they continued to move away from their longtime
dependence on the local calling business.
</P>
<P>
   SBC, the local phone company for most of the Southwest and
Midwest, said Tuesday it earned $1.9 billion or 56 cents per share
in the first three months of the year, excluding factors such as
costs related to the recent acquisitions of Ameritech and Sterling
Commerce. In the same period last year, operating profits totaled
$1.7 billion, or 49 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   Including all one-time items, SBC's net income totaled $1.8
billion or 53 cents per share, down from $2 billion or 51 cents per
share in the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   SBC's revenues grew 8 percent to $12.5 billion compared with the
year ago tally of $11.8 billion. Data-related revenues grew 41
percent to $1.6 billion, while wireless revenues rose 30 percent to
$1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic's operating profit totaled $1.27 billion, or 80
cents a share, in the first quarter. An accounting charge of $536
million left a net profit of $731 million or 46 cents a share,
reflecting the shifting value of an investment in Cable &AMP; Wireless
Communications of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter of 1999, Bell Atlantic posted operating
earnings of $1.15 billion or 73 cents a share, and a net profit of
$1.14 billion or 72 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   First quarter revenues totaled $8.53 billion, rising 7 percent
from $7.97 billion in the same period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which won federal approval to sell long distance in
New York in December, said it has signed up 428,000 residential
customers since launching the service in early January.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our long distance results put us well ahead of schedule in
meeting our target of 1 million residence customers by year-end,''
said Ivan Seidenberg, Bell Atlantic's chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues from Bell Atlantic's core local phone business, serving
most of the eastern United States, rose nearly 5 percent to $3.64
billion. Elsewhere, wireless revenues grew 30.5 percent to $1.29
billion and revenues from Internet and other data services grew 32
percent to $892 million.
</P>
<P>
   After Tuesday's earnings reports, SBC's stock rose $2.68} to
$44.93} at 5 p.m. EDT on the New York Stock Exchange, while Bell
Atlantic rose $1 to $62.93}.

<HEADLINE> Pharmacia Profits Rise 27 Percent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Pharmacia Inc.'s first quarter profits jumped 27
percent, powered by strong sales of the company's top arthritis and
glaucoma drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacia, formed by the merger last month between Monsanto Co.
and Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, said excluding merger costs it earned $425
million, or 33 cents a share, compared to $332 million, or 26 cents
a share, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   It was the company's first earnings report and results matched
Wall Street expectations, according to First Call/Thomson
Financial.
</P>
<P>
   But with growth in drug sales below the pace of industry
leaders, Phamacia stock fell 7 percent, dropping $4.06\ to close at
$54 a share on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmaceutical sales rose 10 percent to $2.8 billion from $2.6.
billion at Pharmacia. Sales have been growing closer to 15 percent
at most major drug companies.
</P>
<P>
   Sales were paced by the arthritis drug Celebrex which increased
92 percent to $534 million. Celebrex was introduced in January
1998, and became the hottest selling new drug ever.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of the glaucoma drug Xalatan rose 58 percent to $161
million.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, sales rose 6 percent to $4.3 billion from $4.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Including merger-related costs and other one time events, the
company's first quarter profits fell 70 percent to $98 million or 7
cents per share from $324 million or 25 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   Agricultural product sales fell 2 percent to $1.4 billion.

<HEADLINE> Argentina Ups Security Before Vote  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- A week after a clash between
labor leaders and police forced delays of a vote on labor reform,
legislators will try again -- but behind a phalanx of police.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Federico Stroani said Tuesday the government
will dispatch some 300 police officers to guard Congress during
Wednesday's discussion of restructuring the labor force.
</P>
<P>
   Stroani said fences would be erected to protect lawmakers
entering the building, and he promised that demonstrators will be
allowed to ''protest in peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate consideration of the bill to overhaul the country's
antiquated labor laws was postponed last Wednesday after a protest
organized by labor leaders ended in a confrontation with police,
leaving at least 30 people injured.
</P>
<P>
   The clash prompted criticism of the government's handling of the
protest, and 14 policemen were detained for questioning after TV
footage showed officers manhandling marchers.
</P>
<P>
   President Fernando De la Rua has described the restructuring of
Argentina's labor force as vital to jump-start Argentina's economy
saddled with 14 percent unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   But labor supporters say the bill's passage will drive down
wages and weaken the workers' movement.

<HEADLINE> Five Ex-Argentine Officers Detained  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Police detained two former
military officers Tuesday as part of an investigation into the
disappearance of 30 political prisoners during the past
dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Retired officers Osvaldo Quiroga and Francisco Pedro Daloia were
ordered held one day after three former military officers were
arrested in the case. Former Lieut. Col. Enrique Moner Ruiz,
retired Maj. Gustavo Alsina, and retired Sgt. Miguel Angel Perez,
were detained on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge ordered the detentions after it was determined
that Perez had given false testimony; the other four officers were
held for refusing to testify.
</P>
<P>
   The officers arrested on Monday were spit upon and insulted by
opponents as they were led before Federal Judge Cristina Garzon de
Lascano and detained in Cordoba, 475 miles northwest of Buenos
Aires, according to the accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Garzon is leading the so-called ''Historical Truth''
investigation, bidding to clarify the deaths or disappearances of
30 prisoners in Cordoba, apparent victims of the former military
rulers who governed between 1976 and 1982. Human rights groups
charge that several were killed, their deaths reported as the
result of clashes or escape attempts.
</P>
<P>
   A government report found at least 9,000 people had died or
disappeared during a crackdown on leftist opponents during the
dictatorship-era ''Dirty War.'' Human rights groups say the figure
could be as high as 30,000.
</P>
<P>
   The five former officers are shielded by a 1990 blanket amnesty
covering Dirty War era abuses. But the reports said it did not
prohibit their detention for clarification of the cases involved.

<HEADLINE> 3 Die in Evacuation Helicopter Crash  </HEADLINE>
By VICKIE CHACHERE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- A medical evacuation helicopter
crashed Tuesday on the marshy edge of Tampa Bay, killing the three
crew members aboard, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   No patients were aboard. The Bayflite helicopter, which crashed
shortly after noon, had just dropped off a patient at Bayfront
Medical Center in St. Petersburg and was returning to its home base
at St. Joseph's Hospital in Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the helicopter went down in pieces after clipping
and toppling a 500-foot broadcast tower. But officials said they
did not know if the helicopter was already in trouble when it hit
the tower, or if clipping the tower caused the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The weather was clear and visibility was good. No mechanical
problem was reported, said Sue Brody, Bayfront's chief executive
officer.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter crashed in the Snug Harbor-Weedon Island area of
mangroves and canoe trails, northeast of St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   The victims were Alicia Betita Collins, 51, of Tampa, an Air
Force flight nurse who also worked part time for Bayflite; Bayflite
paramedic Eric Hangarter, 29, of Sarasota, and pilot Mark Wallace,
39, of Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   The crews of local air ambulances are mostly made up of
firefighters and paramedics who do duty as a part-time job.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Stubblefield, 31, a flight medic assigned to the
helicopter that crashed, was on his day off when the phone rang and
he was told his crew had gone down.
</P>
<P>
   ''You never know when is the last time you will see them,'' said
Stubblefield, a Clearwater firefighter. ''Everybody knows there is
an element of danger, but you don't think about it.''

<HEADLINE> P&AMP;G Third-Quarter Earnings Drop  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NOLAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Shares of Procter &AMP; Gamble fell 9 percent
Tuesday after the consumer products giant said third-quarter net
income declined 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   P&AMP;G, whose products include Tide detergent, Folgers coffee and
Pampers diapers, reported earnings of $753 million, or 52 cents per
share, compared with $1.04 billion, or 72 cents per share, in the
year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
   This year's results include one-time reorganization charges of
$170 million. Excluding the charge. P&AMP;G earned 64 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   The results were in line with the forecasts by analysts surveyed
by First Call/Thomson Financial, though the projections had been
downgraded after the company warned of a disappointing quarter last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Investors weren't pleased with the results, however. Shares fell
$6.18} to $64.31\ in trading on the New York Stock Exchange and
remain well off their 52-week high of $118.37{.
</P>
<P>
   Net sales for the quarter ended March 31 increased by 6 percent
to $9.78 billion, compared with $9.2 billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''Top-line growth remains strong, although earnings are clearly
disappointing,'' said Durk Jager, P&AMP;G's chairman and chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are redoubling our efforts to manage costs ... We are
committed to delivering the stronger earnings growth we are capable
of,'' Jager said.
</P>
<P>
   Management said Tuesday that higher costs -- increased investment
in new product efforts plus a slight decline in the company's gross
profit margin -- figured into the third-quarter results.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it would step up efforts to control costs and
work harder to develop new products and reduce the time needed to
get them to market.
</P>
<P>
   For the first nine months of P&AMP;G's fiscal year, earnings were
$3.03 billion, or $2.10 per share, down 10 percent from the prior
year's $3.3 billion, or $2.30 per share.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide sales for the nine months totaled $30.3 billion, a 6
percent increase from $28.7 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Cincinnati-based company sells about 300 product brands in
more than 140 countries. It employs about 110,000 people worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Ohio Motto Said Unconstitutional  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NOLAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Ohio's motto, ''With God, all things are
possible,'' was declared unconstitutional Tuesday by a federal
appeals court that said the phrase amounts to a government
endorsement of Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   The 2-1 decision by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
reversed a lower court's ruling that permitted Ohio's use of the
motto. The motto was taken from the New Testament, specifically
Matthew 19:26, which quotes Jesus Christ.
</P>
<P>
   ''When Jesus spoke to his disciples, he was explaining to them
what was needed of them to enter heaven and achieve salvation, a
uniquely Christian thought not shared by Jews and Moslems,''
Circuit Judge Avern Cohn wrote for the three-judge panel.
</P>
<P>
   In a dissent, Circuit Judge David Nelson said he found Ohio's
motto no more troubling than the words ''In God We Trust'' on U.S.
coins.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio's motto was challenged by the American Civil Liberties
Union, which contended the phrase cannot be separated from its
biblical context as part of a discussion of salvation.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU, representing the Rev. Matthew Peterson, a Presbyterian
minister in suburban Cleveland, challenged all official uses of the
motto, which was adopted in 1959 and has appeared for years on the
Ohio secretary of state's stationery, on some state reports and on
Ohio tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is maybe the blandest statement about God that has ever
been struck down,'' said Douglas Laycock, professor of law at the
University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   According to Cohn, two federal appeals courts since 1970 have
ruled that ''In God We Trust'' is permissible and does not amount
to a government sponsorship or endorsement of religion. Cohn said
the U.S. Supreme Court has never decided a direct challenge to
either the inclusion of God in the Pledge of Allegiance or ''In God
We Trust,'' which he said is adapted from the Book of Psalms.
</P>
<P>
   The state said it will challenge the ruling. It could appeal to
the full, 13-judge appellate court or the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ''The state does not use the motto to promote or advance any
single set of religious beliefs,'' Gov. Bob Taft said.
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling, the appeals court said U.S. District Judge James
Graham erred in 1998 when he allowed Ohio to use the motto as long
as it did not cite the biblical origin of the words.
</P>
<P>
   Around the country, there have been numerous court challenges of
religious displays on government property and prayer in school. In
1999, city officials in Republic, Mo., agreed to remove the
Christian fish symbol from the city seal after the ACLU sued.
</P>
<P>
   Atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair for years tried unsuccessfully to
remove ''In God We Trust'' from currency and stop jurors from
saying ''so help me God.''
</P>
<P>
   But Laycock said ''there have not been high-profile cases of
this sort'' involving a slogan. ''For the most part, courts haven't
been much interested in these cases and have kind of brushed aside
challenges,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Club To Fund Congress Races  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hoping to make the environment a bigger
political issue, the Sierra Club began an $8 million TV and radio
campaign Tuesday aimed at 17 congressional races.
</P>
<P>
   The ads, mostly praising Democrats, will be combined with other
activities, including voter guides and fliers at community events,
as the group attempts to elect a more pro-environment Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club is spending several hundred thousand dollars on
the first round of ads, which began airing Tuesday. Within the next
couple of months, the group also plans ads on the presidential
campaign, criticizing the record of Gov. George W. Bush in Texas,
as it did during the GOP primaries. It may also air ads praising
Democrat Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The ads unveiled Tuesday both praise and criticize candidates
for the House and Senate, almost exclusively helping Democrats.
Just one Republican is praised and no Democrats are criticized.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's no secret that Democrats generally have better records,''
said Dan Weiss, political director for the Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   The group would not say who was paying for the campaign. The
money is being routed using a provision of the tax code that allows
the group to avoid paying taxes on contributions without requiring
it to say where the money comes from.
</P>
<P>
   The group said it was looking for tight races where it could
make a difference, and it chose many of the closest races around
the country. But the one Republican who is praised, Rep.
Christopher Shays of Connecticut, is not expected to face stiff
competition. In his district, the Sierra Club plans to run only
radio ads.
</P>
<P>
   Most places will see television ads, typically around TV news
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Using polling that shows people care about local environmental
concerns, the group is targeting each campaign around a local
issue. In Michigan, it's pollution in the Great Lakes. In
Washington state, it's salmon runs. And in Montana, it's
contamination from the Zortman-Landusky Mine.
</P>
<P>
   ''All politics is local when it comes to the environment,'' said
Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who helped the Sierra Club
develop the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In past campaigns, the Sierra Club spent just under half of its
political money on paid advertising, with the rest paying for
grass-roots activities. A precise budget for 2000 was not
available, Weiss said.
</P>
<P>
   The group may add to its list of targeted races. So far, in
addition to Shays, it plans campaigns supporting Democratic Reps.
Mark Udall of Colorado, James Maloney of Connecticut, Dennis Moore
of Kansas, David Bonior of Michigan, Rush Holt of New Jersey,
Shelley Berkley of Nevada, Joseph Hoeffel of Pennsylvania, Adam
Smith and Jay Inslee of Washington and Lane Evans of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   It also plans to criticize the records of these Republicans
running for the Senate: Sens. Slade Gorton of Washington, Spencer
Abraham of Michigan and Conrad Burns of Montana, New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani and former Virginia Gov. George Allen. It also
plans to criticize the record of Rep. Don Sherwood, R-Pa.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The declaration by Rep. Bob Franks late last
summer was emphatic: He was giving up his House seat to run for
U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   One thing he did not give up, however, was his House
fund-raising account.
</P>
<P>
   For six months after announcing he was a candidate for Senate,
Franks, R-Berkeley Heights, continued to raise money for a House
re-election campaign he will not wage, moving money from that
account into his Senate campaign coffers.
</P>
<P>
   He thus was able to collect donations from political action
committees that otherwise would have remained neutral in New
Jersey's contested primary for an open Senate seat. Many PACs, as a
matter of policy, keep out of intra-party contests.
</P>
<P>
   Raising money in a House account and moving it to a Senate
account is legal, although not all House members running for Senate
do it. Unlike Franks, Rep. Robert Weygand, a Democrat running this
year in a contested Senate primary in Rhode Island, closed his
House account last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Between Sept. 13, 1999, when he announced he was a candidate for
Senate, and March 31, when he terminated his House account, Franks
collected more than $50,000 from political action committees
through his House account. In total, he has moved about $335,000
from his House account to his Senate account.
</P>
<P>
   Union Pacific Corp.'s PAC donated $2,500 to Franks' House
account in October. ''We gave this money to Franks fully intending
it to go to his House race,'' said the PAC's spokesman, Gary
Schuster. In fact, Franks had declared himself a candidate for
Senate weeks before the donation.
</P>
<P>
   PACs have emerged as a point of dispute on the Republican side
of the race to succeed retiring Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   One of Franks' competitors, Essex County Executive James
Treffinger, has declared he will not take PAC money. His campaign
mockingly labeled Franks ''PAC-MAN.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. William Gormley of Atlantic County has raised nearly
$50,000 from PACs representing the casino industry in Atlantic
City. A fourth candidate, Murray Sabrin, has raised about $12,000
in PAC money.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Franks has
received $633,850 from PACs, or 37 percent of his overall total. By
contrast, Gormley has received $104,200 from PACs, or 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Franks declared himself a candidate for Senate on Sept. 13. On
Nov. 8, he traveled through the state to kick off his campaign
officially.
</P>
<P>
   But PACs, as well as a few individuals, continued giving to his
House account through March of this year.
</P>
<P>
   His House campaign registered a $1,000 contribution from the
American Neurological Surgery PAC on March 30, $2,000 from
Prudential Insurance Co.'s PAC on March 30, and $1,500 from the
Independent Insurance Agents of America PAC on March 2.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Connors, senior vice president for government affairs at
the American Hotel and Motel Association, said it's fine by him
that Franks will use that PAC's $1,000 donation to seek the
nomination for Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whether it was put into his House account or his Senate
account, our intent was to support Bob Franks,'' Connors said,
praising Franks as a friend to New Jersey's tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
   Franks' campaign manager, Charlie Smith, said the practice of
raising money for a Senate race through an existing House account
''may or may not be unusual'' but is completely legal and subject
to public scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ''The same contribution limits apply,'' he said. ''And this is a
very open process. These are public records, both the House and
Senate accounts. Anyone who wishes to see our disclosed
contributions has the ability to review both the House and Senate
accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   That federal PACs would support a sitting member of Congress is
no surprise, Smith added. He said PACs are nothing more than a
vehicle to aggregate and distribute the political contributions of
employees of a company or industry, or supporters of a particular
cause.
</P>
<P>
   Treffinger, Smith said, does something similar. He said
Treffinger's Senate campaign has taken in $91,250 from 183
contributors who list their employer as Essex County.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe his criticism is hypocritical,'' Smith said.
Treffinger's campaign declined to respond.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Franks' success at drawing PAC contributions, he trails
in the fund-raising race among Republican Senate hopefuls. Gormley
had raised more than $2.1 million as of March 31, compared to $1.6
million for Franks, $1.1 million for Treffinger and $250,000 for
Sabrin, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

<HEADLINE> Govt. Seeks More Rest for Truckers  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Truck drivers would have to rest longer
between shifts under rules the government proposed Tuesday to try
to reduce the number of accidents caused by exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   ''This proposal is designed to increase safety on our nation's
highways,'' said Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, estimating
the changes would prevent 2,600 accidents and as many as 115
fatalities every year.
</P>
<P>
   The American Trucking Association opposed the new rules,
contending that they would require thousands of additional drivers
and trucks to meet current delivery schedules. Some safety
advocates complained that the change would allow long-distance
truckers to drive for 12 hours straight.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would establish work limits for five different
classes of drivers, with long-distance operators limited to no more
than 12 hours of driving in a 24-hour period. They would also have
to install electronic monitors on their trucks to monitor their
work hours.
</P>
<P>
   Current rules, adopted more than 60 years ago, say truckers can
drive no more than 10 hours straight, following by at least eight
hours off. That creates the possibility of driving as much as 16
hours in a 24-hour period, Slater said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new proposal the big-rig drivers would have to have a
mandatory rest period of 10 consecutive hours every 24 hours, with
an additional two hours of rest taken during the work shift or at
its beginning or end. That effectively would mean drivers could
work 12 hours on and 12 off each day.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, the truckers' association announced its own proposal
to increase rest time for drivers: 14 hours on-duty in 24 hours,
requiring at least 10 hours off between shifts.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials also expressed concern about recording
devices invading the privacy of truckers and said anyone who would
fail to keep an honest logbook could also tamper with a recorder.
</P>
<P>
   ''This proposal could mean a 50 percent increase in the number
of refrigerated and dry van trucks on our already crowded highways;
that translates into as many as 180,000 additional drivers and
trucks on the road just to keep the current economy moving,'' said
ATA president Walter B. McCormick, Jr. ''This all adds up to a
threat to the U.S. economy and American jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The current ''just-in-time'' operations that depend on arrival
of parts at factories and goods at stores when needed require
flexible trucking schedules, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Gillan of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety said
allowing 12 consecutive hours of driving would make ''drivers even
more exhausted and will result in an increased risk of
fatigue-related crashes.''
</P>
<P>
   And Parents Against Tired Truckers issued a statement saying the
group was ''stunned'' that the department was proposing to allow
longer hours.
</P>
<P>
   But the American Insurance Association backed the new government
proposal as a needed step in reducing highway fatalities and
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-on, 12-off rule would apply to national and regional
drivers who operate away from their base of operations.
</P>
<P>
   The rule would also establish three other groups of drivers and
set rules for them:
</P>
<P>
   --Local drivers who travel no more than six hours away from their
base and return there after each shift: at least 12 consecutive
hours off in each 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   --Local drivers working a split shift: at least 9 consecutive
hours off during each 24-hour period with an additional three hours
off at some other point in the same 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   --Local work vehicle staff whose primary function is something
other than driving: at least 9 consecutive hours off in any 24-hour
period.
</P>
<P>
   The department's Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration is
seeking comments on the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are open to suggestions and we will be listening,'' Slater
said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency hopes to have work on the rule completed by the end
of the year and plans to schedule hearings in Atlanta, Denver,
Indianapolis, Kansas City, Mo., Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and
the Springfield, Mass.-Hartford, Conn., area.

<HEADLINE> Gun Goes Off on Alaska Airline  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- A gun went off in the cargo hold of an
Alaska Airlines jet awaiting takeoff, firing a bullet up through
the cabin floor, where it lodged in a diaper bag. No one was
injured.
</P>
<P>
   The .357-caliber pistol was in a suitcase and discharged Monday
night when a baggage handler threw the bag onto the Boeing 737,
which was about to leave for Anchorage, Alaska, airport police
officer Michael Brant said.
</P>
<P>
   The bullet tore through a diaper bag stowed under a seat and
lodged in a baby's changing pad, Brant said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was right under our feet,'' said Grant Johnson, who had
placed the bag under the seat and notified a flight attendant after
hearing a loud noise near his feet. ''It was just a few inches away
and it could have hurt somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Passenger Betty Jean Smith, 66, of Eagle River, Alaska, was
charged with reckless endangerment and concealing a weapon without
a permit. She had two loaded guns in her bag.
</P>
<P>
   ''She didn't know anything about firearms,'' Brant said. ''She
brought them here for her son. He didn't want them so she was
bringing them home.''
</P>
<P>
   Regulations require that passengers declare guns packed in
luggage and that those guns be unloaded.
</P>
<P>
   The crew and the 85 passengers were transferred to another plane
so maintenance workers could check the jet for damage.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines has been under scrutiny since a jet crashed Jan.
31 off the California coast, killing all 88 people aboard.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Rises 228; Dow Ends Up 218  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Bargain-hunting investors, enticed by a round of
strong corporate earnings reports, pounced on the technology sector
Tuesday, helping the Nasdaq composite index and the Dow Jones
industrial average gain more than 200 points apiece.
</P>
<P>
   The largest and best-established high-tech stocks led the gains
as investors once again placed their bets on the companies most
likely to thrive amid investors' shifting sentiments about
technology issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite rose 228.75 to close at 3,711.23, more than
wiping out Monday's 161.40-point loss. It was the second biggest
point gain ever for the Nasdaq; just one week ago, the Nasdaq rose
254.41 points, its largest single-day gain.
</P>
<P>
   The increasingly volatile index has recorded its 10 biggest
point gains and its 10 biggest point losses since the start of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 218.72 to close at
11,124.82 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 47.58 to 1,477.44.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The market's advance,
which came on steady volume with more stocks rising than falling,
heartened traders who have weathered a long string of chaotic
sessions this month.
</P>
<P>
   ''Earnings have been impressive and the economy is in good
shape,'' said Ned Collins, head of trading at Daiwa Securities
America. ''I'm not sure we're completely in the clear, but we were
due for a rally.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong earnings reports lured investors back to the technology
sector after Monday's selloff. Corning soared 28 to 179 after
reporting first-quarter operating earnings of $178.1 million, or 64
cents a share. Analysts had expected Corning to post operating
earnings of 55 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has transformed its business in recent years
to focus on fiber optics, also released upbeat projections for the
remainder of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline.com, the name-your-price Internet company, said after
the close of trading Monday that its first-quarter loss was
narrower than expected and that sales surged more than 500 percent
compared with a year ago. Its shares rose 2 13/16 to 64 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   Sapient, a technology consulting company, rose 15 11/16 to 75
11/16. Two Wall Street brokerages raised their ratings on the stock
after the company reported robust profit growth.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which dominated Monday's technology selloff with its
16 percent decline, recovered some ground, rising 2} to 69].
</P>
<P>
   ''Technology stocks have been sold down so sharply that some
investors believe it's bargain-hunting time in the tech and telecom
sectors,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock
&AMP; Co. ''It appears for now that many Nasdaq stocks are oversold.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some favorites that suffered in recent weeks bounced
back strongly. JDS Uniphase was up 13 to 93 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   After its punishing selloffs earlier this month, the Nasdaq is
now more than 26 percent below its all-time high of 5,048.62,
reached March 10. The Nasdaq is also down nearly 9 percent for the
year, but it remains 40 percent above its level at this time last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the technology companies that dominate the Nasdaq were
posting better earnings reports than the blue-chip Dow components.
Procter &AMP; Gamble fell 6\ to 64\ after saying earnings in the third
fiscal quarter fell 28 percent from a year ago because of higher
costs. The report confirmed Procter &AMP; Gamble's dour warning in
early March that sliced more than $35 billion from the company's
market value.
</P>
<P>
   The maker of Scotch tape and other products, 3M, fell 3 9/16 to
93 13/16. The company met earnings expectations, but warned that
profit growth for the full year may slow and is not likely to
exceed analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dow's technology components were strong enough to
outweigh the weakness in the consumer group. Intel gained 8~ to 125
and Hewlett-Packard rose 7 to 139 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 13-to-5 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange. On the Nasdaq, advancers led by a
2-to-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE composite volume totaled 1.28 billion shares, compared with
1.05 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 20.49 to
489.03.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.1 percent.
Germany's Xetra DAX index rose 1.7 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100
rose 0.7 percent, and France's CAC-40 gained 1.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> Zoo Shooting Sparks Security Fears  </HEADLINE>
By DERRILL HOLLY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As an 11-year-old boy remained in critical
condition and six other young people recovered from gunshot wounds,
Washington officials on Tuesday called for stricter gun controls
but insisted the National Zoo and the capital's other tourist
attractions are safe.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Anthony Williams said more must be done to reduce
teen-agers' access to guns and discourage them from resorting to
deadly force to resolve conflicts. ''Instead of reaching for a
bottle or a rock,'' as children used to do, ''you're now reaching
for guns,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton echoed that theme during a White House event
on hate crimes. ''It should be obvious that we can do more and we
must do more,'' Clinton said, calling the shootings ''a senseless
act.''
</P>
<P>
   But Williams and zoo officials said devices like metal detectors
would not be immediately added to the zoo when it reopens
Wednesday. ''I don't think that's called for,'' Williams said.
''It's certainly safe. This is a rare event.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven children between 11 and 16 years old were shot Monday
following a fight at the National Zoo, which was crowded with
thousands of people at an annual black family celebration. The
11-year-old boy remains in critical condition but doctors said ''he
is responsive to care and his overall medical condition has
improved.''
</P>
<P>
   A 12-year-old girl and 14-year-old boy were both in good
condition with wounds to the pelvis and leg, respectively. The
other children were hospitalized with lesser injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Although police say the fight involved two large groups of young
people, they have stopped short of labeling the violence
gang-related. ''It was one person with one weapon,'' said Cmdr.
Peter Newsham of the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   No arrests have been made.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
is offering a $25,000 reward for information leading to an arrest
and conviction in the case.
</P>
<P>
   A local crime solvers program has also issued a $1,000 reward.
Williams said the $1,000 reward will increase to $10,000 if the
youngest victim dies.
</P>
<P>
   Williams also said the shootings should not end the 100-year-old
tradition of black families gathering at the zoo on the Monday
after Easter. ''People ought to be able to visit any of our
monuments, any of our tourist attractions and feel safe and
comfortable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The zoo was closed on Tuesday but will reopen Wednesday. Zoo
officials discounted the need for metal detectors and increased
security when the zoo reopens. ''It's too early to consider any
measures like that,'' said Bob Hoage, a zoo spokesman. ''We still
need to get more information.''
</P>
<P>
   But officials admitted Tuesday their 14-member Smithsonian
Institution security detail may not be enough to cope with large
crowds attracted to the park for major events. ''We're trying to
put pieces of the puzzle together and to work with the metropolitan
police,'' Hoage said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, officials in the D.C. Public Schools sent ten mental
health counselors to two of the city's 143 schools to help students
cope with the injuries to their classmates. Student Intervention
Director Diane Powell said counselors will be at the elementary
school attended by the most seriously injured student throughout
the week.

<HEADLINE> Euro Falls to New Low Vs. Dollar  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The euro fell below 93 cents for the first time
ever, then tumbled below 92 cents, in a steep selloff Tuesday amid
concerns that the European Central Bank will not take aggressive
steps to boost the troubled currency.
</P>
<P>
   The euro fell as low as 91.62 cents in U.S. trading Tuesday
afternoon before recovering a little bit of its lost ground. The
previous low of 93.55 cents was set during trading Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The single currency adopted in January 1999 by 11 European
nations ended the trading day in New York at 92.08 cents, down from
93.98 cents Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar also was quoted at 105.81 Japanese yen in New York,
up from 105.69 yen, but the dollar fell against the British pound.
</P>
<P>
   As the euro fell in value, the dollar gained strength on a
strong rebound in U.S. stock markets. Rising share prices increased
the demand for dollars from foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   The euro has come under pressure in recent weeks amid questions
over how European authorities will defend the currency.
</P>
<P>
   While many traders expect the European Central Bank to raise
interest rates at its meeting Thursday, they believe such action
would only serve as a temporary remedy to the sagging single
currency.
</P>
<P>
   And if the ECB doesn't raise rates, that could send a message to
foreign-exchange markets that the central bank isn't interested in
stemming the euro's decline, traders said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the recent selloff may be the result of traders
signaling to the ECB that they need to act aggressively to prop up
the euro.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Florio promises campaign finance reform if elected  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Former Gov. Jim Florio says his opponent is
a ''walking ATM operation.'' So Florio's first order of business in
the Senate if he beats a man doling out more than $1 million a week
on TV ads: campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Spending by Democratic rival Jon Corzine took reform from an
intellectual abstract to ''an emotional issue'', Florio said at a
news conference Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In his mind, the U.S. Supreme Court improperly linked spending
with First Amendment rights and created ''an artificial distinction
between contributions and expenditures,'' Florio said. If
ultimately elected, Florio said his first priority would be to
rewrite the laws and add a spending cap on congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''Speech is not money,'' Florio said, alleging that the current
system allows for ''people who are ultra-rich and decided they want
to buy their way into the system.''
</P>
<P>
   His opponent in the Democratic primary is just that, Florio
contends. Corzine ''is on track'' to spend $25 million of his
estimated $300 million fortune, Florio said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is it legal? Yes. Is it good policy? The answer, I suspect is
not,'' Florio said. ''The republic will be at risk if we continue
to allow money, not just to be a destructive part of the process,
but to be the process.''
</P>
<P>
   In his own news conference an hour later, Corzine supported
spending limits -- as long as candidates were given free television
time. Those expensive ads are needed by unknowns such as himself in
''the extraordinary effort'' of telling voters ''both message and
credentials,'' Corzine said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is very, very difficult in our society today, which is so
media driven, for any individual to compete in a process unless
they have already been involved in a political arena,'' Corzine
said.
</P>
<P>
   The former chief of the Wall Street investment firm Goldman
Sachs, Corzine made his comments after being endorsed by the state
Senate's leading Democrat, Sen. Richard J. Codey, D-Essex.
</P>
<P>
   Codey praised Corzine's stands on health care, gun control and
education. But the senator also touted Corzine's bankroll. Codey
said Corzine's own money and $3 million he has raised so far will
help him compete in November, and that makes him the better
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has the ability to cut through the Bush-Gore campaign and
the Hillary-Rudy campaign,'' Codey said.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating that endorsement, Florio said those backing Corzine
have yet to say why the banker would be a better senator.
</P>
<P>
   But, Codey said, ''You can't be the best senator unless you can
win.''
</P>
<P>
   That focus on winning by outspending costs voters the
opportunity to choose a candidate based on ideas and merits, Florio
said. Once Corzine appeared to be running for the nomination, as
many as six other potential Democratic candidates backed out, he
alleged.
</P>
<P>
   ''That means we were denied the opportunity to hear the ideas of
five or six other people,'' Florio said.
</P>
<P>
   Florio repeatedly said there is nothing illegal about Corzine's
plan to spend record amounts of his own cash. But, he said, voters
deserve to know exactly where the money is coming from.
</P>
<P>
   Florio again demanded that Corzine make public his income tax
returns and other financial forms. Corzine has only offered a
summary of his income tax filings, a report that shows he earned
roughly $100 million in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine maintains that he has satisfied the legal limits of the
disclosure requirements. To offer more details of his assets would
violate the privacy of his former Goldman Sachs partners, Corzine
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If people want to know what they are, they can do the
investigations. The information is available,'' Corzine said.

<HEADLINE> Tuesday's Commodities Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE CARPENTER, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Copper futures surged to a three-week high Tuesday on the Comex
division of the New York Mercantile Exchange as China's buying
interest revived a slumping price.
</P>
<P>
   In other commodity markets, crude oil and gasoline fell, and
cattle rose.
</P>
<P>
   Copper futures bolted 3 percent higher in a rally attributed
partly to technical reasons and partly to traders' perceptions that
China had entered the market to scoop up the metal at
bargain-basement prices.
</P>
<P>
   May copper rose 2.35 cents to 78.95 cents a pound.
</P>
<P>
   The gain came despite federal data showing consumer confidence
weakened in April for the third consecutive month, suggesting
possible hiccups ahead for both the U.S. economy and the
construction industry, whose fate copper is tied to closely.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said demand for the metal remains high, and the recent
slide below 75 cents a pound has brought bargain-hunters into the
market, including China. Inventory data released Tuesday showed a
decline in supplies -- London warehouse stocks were down by 2,350
metric tons and Comex inventories were down 1,576 short tons.
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as demand continues to remain strong, even in the
midst of this potentially interest rate heavy environment ... it's
strong enough to hold this market in check,'' said Dave Meger,
metals analyst for Alaron Trading Corp. in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on the New York Merc, crude tumbled 3 percent and
gasoline also fell on expectations that inventories increased last
week, possibly already reflecting some of the newly increased oil
output by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
   The selloff came ahead of the release of weekly data by the
American Petroleum Institute.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the estimates that drove the market were well
short of the mark. U.S. crude stocks rose by 4.25 million barrels,
more than double expectations, over the previous week. Gasoline
supplies, meanwhile, sank by 675,000 barrels.
</P>
<P>
   Distillates, which include heating oil and diesel fuel, rose by
224,000 barrels.
</P>
<P>
   West Texas Intermediate crude for June delivery fell 71 cents to
$25.33 a barrel; after the API data were released, it declined
further in after-hours trading. May unleaded gasoline sank 2.87
cents to 82.32 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Also, May heating oil fell .24 cent to 75.05 cents a gallon and
May natural gas fell 2.7 cents to $3.110 per 1,000 cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
   In London, June Brent crude fell 50 cents to $23.33 a barrel on
the International Petroleum Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Cattle prices jumped higher on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
amid growing demand for beef as U.S. consumers gear up for summer
barbecue season.
</P>
<P>
   June live cattle rose .38 cent to 69.65 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Presses for Hate Crime Law  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton pressed for Congress to pass
legislation making it easier for federal prosecutors to bring
charges in hate crimes. ''We don't have a single excuse not to do
it,'' he said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, along with Attorney General Janet Reno, gathered state
law enforcement officials at the White House to mobilize support
for the stagnant Hate Crimes Prevention Act and press Republican
congressional leaders to take it up.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton convened the session just days before a gay rights march
in Washington this weekend that is expected to draw about 200,000
people. Passage of hate-crimes legislation is high on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our laws should not ignore reality,'' Reno said. ''Haters are
cowards and, when confronted, they so often back down. When we are
silent, they are emboldened.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would add offenses motivated by sexual orientation,
gender or disability to the list of hate crimes already covered
under federal law. It also would give federal prosecutors the
option of pursuing a hate-crime case if local authorities declined
to press charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, federal prosecutors cannot prosecute even the most
heinous crimes unless the victim was voting, serving on a jury, or
doing some other federally protected activity,'' Clinton said.
''That defies common sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said more than 7,700 hate incidents took place in
the United States during 1998, and experts believe many more were
never reported.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate unanimously approved hate-crimes legislation in July
but it stalled in the House. Clinton vetoed a spending bill for the
Commerce, Justice and State departments because it lacked a hate
crimes provision. Critics say the bill is redundant and
unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   A senior White House official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Monday that Republican presidential candidate
George W. Bush's ''trouble with Bob Jones and extremist elements in
the Republican Party'' were factors in renewing the push for a
hate-crimes bill.
</P>
<P>
   The official was referring to Bush's failure to denounce the
South Carolina university's ban on interracial dating. Bush
apologized for not speaking out a week after winning the South
Carolina GOP primary.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the need to address hate crimes is not a matter of
partisan politics, ''but a simple statement of fact.'' Then he
brought up a case in Lubbock, Texas, in which federal prosecutors
won hate crime convictions against a trio of skinheads who killed a
black man in hopes of launching a race war.
</P>
<P>
   He said federal hate charges could be filed only because the
slaying took place on a public street, rather than on private
property.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time Clinton cited a case in Texas -- where
Bush is governor -- to illustrate the need for a hate-crimes law. In
March, Clinton said Bush failed to respond to Texans who wanted a
hate-crimes law in response to the murder of James Byrd, who was
tied to a truck and dragged to death by three white men.
</P>
<P>
   Bush responded to Clinton's allegations by accusing the Clinton
administration of ''trying to tear me down.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican National Committee spokesman Chris Paulitz said
Tuesday, ''It is absolutely disgusting that they would use racial
matters like this as a political ploy just to get (Vice President)
Al Gore to be president.''

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Ally Killed in Attack  </HEADLINE>
By MISHA SAVIC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Assailants shot and killed an ally
of President Slobodan Milosevic as he walked his dog near his home
Tuesday night, the latest in a series of attacks against prominent
figures in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Police showed reporters the body of state airline director Zika
Petrovic, who lay face down in a pool of blood. He appeared to have
been shot once at least once in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses and Belgrade's independent Studio B television
reported he was shot by unknown attackers. The witnesses said they
heard shots shortly after 10 p.m. and came outside, but did not see
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   The area was sealed off by police who refused to provide any
details of the attack or indicate if they knew of any motive.
</P>
<P>
   The 62-year-old Petrovic, director of the Yugoslav Airlines
(JAT), was a member of the neo-communist party of Milosevic's wife
Mira Markovic, which is allied with Milosevic's ruling Socialists.
He was not well known for his role in the party, but was known as a
family friend of the Milosevics.
</P>
<P>
   He had recently announced the privatization of JAT, which has
been in dire financial trouble for years because of international
sanctions and flight bans imposed by Western countries against the
state airline.
</P>
<P>
   Petrovic's death is the latest in a series of similar attacks in
Belgrade that go back almost a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Yugoslav Defense Minister Pavle Bulatovic was
gunned down in a restaurant in February. Weeks earlier, Serbia's
notorious warlord Zeljko Raznatovic, also known as Arkan, was
killed in a Belgrade hotel. In July 1999, Police Col. Dragan Simic
was killed, the fifth police official murdered in the city that
year.
</P>
<P>
   Bulatovic was the highest-ranking victim among more than a dozen
prominent figures killed during the past decade of Milosevic's rule
-- including politicians, journalists, police and underworld
figures.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the Bulatovic attack, Milosevic's government
pledged an all-out campaign against terrorism as the
ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party accused American, French or
British intelligence agents of being behind the defense minister's
murder.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALFRED, N.Y. (AP) -- Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton told
hundreds of college students on Tuesday that they should get
involved in the political process.
</P>
<P>
   ''This campaign has much more to do with your futures than with
mine,'' the first lady told a packed 500-seat auditorium at the New
York State College of Ceramics at Alfred University.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know many people have been turned off by politics in the
last several years. In fact, I think it started in the 1960s in my
generation,'' Clinton said. ''People became very cynical and
withdrawn and that leaves the field to people you may not agree
with, to people who have a very different agenda and ideology. I
don't think it is in any of our interests to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate candidate made her appeal as she began a three-day
foray into traditionally conservative upstate New York, a key
battleground in her Senate race against New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly in her 45-minute speech at Alfred University, the
first lady praised the policies of her husband and Vice President
Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''The new Democrat philosophy that the president and the vice
president championed and really symbolized clearly points a
direction for our state and our country to head in,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady drew cheers and applause when she used one of her
favorite lines on the students: ''If we give signing bonuses to
athletes, we ought to give signing bonuses to teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, while not criticizing Giuliani by name, did attack
Republicans in general for pushing school vouchers that would help
parents send their children to private or parochial schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are some places that call themselves churches that set
up schools in garages that I would not want my tax dollars
supporting,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous anti-Clinton signs, including one that read, ''Stand by
your man -- in Arkansas,'' were posted along the road leading into
Alfred.
</P>
<P>
   Placards at the university were more friendly. One suggested,
''Hillary Rocks'' while another said: ''Men want Hillary.''

<HEADLINE> Turkish Candidate Wins Support  </HEADLINE>
By SUZAN FRASER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- A top judge who is an outspoken advocate
of democratic reforms stood to become Turkey's next president after
party leaders in parliament unanimously backed his candidacy
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmet Necdet Sezer, the chief justice of the country's top court
and a strong advocate of the right to free expression, is a
candidate likely to please Turkey's western allies.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey aspires to join the European Union but the 15-nation
group has made it clear that the country needs to take steps to
improve human rights. Hundreds of Turks have been imprisoned for
their writings or speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sezer's election to the presidency would add great force to
Turkey's democratization,'' wrote Sedat Ergin, a commentator for
the daily Hurriyet.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit succeeded in rallying opposition
parties behind Sezer and in a televised ceremony in parliament
signed a declaration of support for Sezer along with the leaders of
the other four parties.
</P>
<P>
   Sezer later got the written endorsement of 131 legislators. He
needed the backing of at least 110 legislators to become a formal
candidate. Twelve other presidential hopefuls presented their bids
before nominations closed at midnight Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting broke out in parliament less than an hour before the
nominations closed when lawmakers of the far-right Nationalist
Action Party tried to prevent State Minister Sadi Somuncuoglu from
submitting his bid. The lawmakers were angered at the minister's
attempt to stand against Sezer in defiance of their leader.
</P>
<P>
   Private newschannel NTV showed one lawmaker shouting obscenities
at Somuncuoglu before thumping his bodyguards. Others called him a
''traitor.''
</P>
<P>
   The president is elected by Turkey's 550-seat parliament, and
analysts said Sezer could win the 367 votes needed to be elected in
the first ballot Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Sezer caused a stir last year when he criticized Turkey's
constitution -- a legacy of the 1980-1983 military rule -- for
restricting basic rights and freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, Sezer argued that under the current
constitution, presidential powers can exceed the limits of
democracy and suggested that they should be curbed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The powers given to the president exceed the boundaries of
parliamentary democracy,'' Sezer said in a speech on the 38th
anniversary of the constitutional court, which he heads. ''In a
democratic state it is not acceptable for a president to share
power with the parliament, which represents the nation's will and
makes important decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkish presidents have the power to veto draft laws or submit
them to a referendum, and call for new elections under certain
conditions. Apart from those powers, the president has largely
ceremonial role.
</P>
<P>
   Sezer lacks experience in foreign policy and is not known as a
deft political maneuverer -- a useful skill for Turkish presidents,
who often act as behind-the-scenes power brokers in times of
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   President Suleyman Demirel has emerged as a key figure in
Turkish foreign policy and has taken a leading role in building
ties to Central Asian and Caucasus states, such as Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
   ''This could mean an important regression in the importance of
the office of the presidency in foreign policy,'' Ergin said.
</P>
<P>
   Sezer is known to be a pro-secular and conservative figure. He
presided over sessions in which the constitutional court shut down
the Islamic Welfare Party two years ago for injecting religion into
politics.

<HEADLINE> FTC, Equinox Settle in Pyramid Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A yearlong battle against illegal pyramid
schemes ended Tuesday with a $40 million settlement, the Federal
Trade Commission said.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement requires dissolution of Equinox International
Corp. and its affiliates, Advanced Marketing Seminars, Inc.; and BG
Management, Inc.
</P>
<P>
   It also bars the companies' founder, William Gouldd, from future
involvements in any multilevel marketing scheme and states that
cash and corporate individual assets be given to a court-appointed
receiver for liquidation.
</P>
<P>
   The assets have an estimated book value of nearly $50 million
and once liquidated are expected to yield approximately $40
million.
</P>
<P>
   Proceeds will be used to repay consumers and pay court-approved
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   In a suit filed jointly with eight states on August 3, 1999 the
FTC alleged that the pyramid schemes were illegal, the companies
made deceptive earnings claims and violated federal law.
</P>
<P>
   State law enforcers alleged violations of state securities laws,
deceptive trade practices laws, false advertising laws, pyramid
laws and licensing securities laws.
</P>
<P>
   The states that filed along with the commission were Hawaii,
Maryland, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Michigan
and South Carolina.

<HEADLINE> Northrop, DaimlerChrysler Eye Deal  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL WHITE, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Northrop Grumman Corp. and Germany's
DaimlerChrysler Aerospace AG are discussing an alliance to develop
advanced radar and electronic surveillance systems in an agreement
that promises to strengthen the U.S. company's ties to European
defense contractors.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, announced Tuesday, comes as defense manufacturers
on both sides of the Atlantic are seeking overseas partners to
reduce research and production costs and develop new markets for
their products.
</P>
<P>
   The talks mark Northrop's second agreement to partner with a
European defense firm. The company also is working with Airbus, the
European aircraft manufacturer, to deploy its Joint Stars
battlefield command and control system aboard Airbus jets. U.S.
versions of Joint Stars are deployed aboard Boeing 707s.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler Aerospace, known as Dasa, and Northrop Grumman
will discuss working together to develop ground surveillance
systems, unmanned high-altitude surveillance airplanes and airborne
and naval radar. Formal announcements on specific projects could be
announced as early as June, the companies said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an important step by our two companies at an important
time in the trans-Atlantic defense relationship,'' said Kent Kresa,
Northrop's chairman, president and chief executive. ''There is no
doubt that the security needs on both sides of the Atlantic can
only be satisfied based on the best use of scarce resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles-based Northrop and Dasa, based in Munich, discussed
an outright merger last year. Northrop, still recovering from its
failed attempted to merge with Lockheed Martin, abandoned the idea
rather than face new political opposition. Dasa instead agreed to a
merger with France's Aerospatiale Matra SA.
</P>
<P>
   Small-scale agreements might be the next-best way to achieve
cost savings without raising eyebrows in Washington, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Northrop shareholders and management went through hell for
over a year as they pushed the edge of the envelope on antitrust
review with the failed Lockheed merger,'' said Jon Kutler,
president of Quarterdeck Investment Partners, an investment bank
specializing in aerospace mergers. ''I would think there is little
appetite for going through that again.''
</P>
<P>
   Discussions likely will focus on products that could help bring
the communications and electronic warfare capabilities of European
members of NATO closer to those of the United States. European
countries lag far behind, and the gap created made joint operations
difficult during the air campaign against Yugoslavia last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a need for U.S. and allied forces to be able to
interrelate more effectively,'' said Jim Taft, a Northrop
spokesman. ''Developing these technologies through such alliances
will help us attain that objective.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. companies explored European alliances during the late 1980s
and early 1990s. They turned instead to domestic mergers in
response to Pentagon spending cuts that followed the end of the
Cold War. The government's opposition to the Northrop-Lockheed
Martin merger stopped that trend and prompted executives to look
abroad for partnerships, said Kutler.
</P>
<P>
   ''U.S. executives realized there was a limit to their ability to
expand in the U.S. market, so they once again dusted off their
cross-border folders, which they hadn't looked at in seven years or
so, and started discussions with European counterparts,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Nortel Tops Profit Forecasts Again  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE MEYERSON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Operating profits soared 80 percent at Nortel
Networks in the first quarter, the company reported Tuesday,
leading a chorus of robust reports by makers of the fiber-optic
gear used to expand and upgrade the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel's profits totaled $347 million or 23 cents per share in
the first three months of 2000, not including one-time factors such
as acquisition costs which left the Canadian company with a net
loss of $730 million or 52 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   In the same period last year, Nortel posted operating profits of
$193 million or 14 cents per share, and a net loss of $186 million
and 14 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues totaled $6.32 billion for the quarter, jumping nearly
50 percent from a year-ago tally of $4.29 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The results, which cruised past Wall Street forecasts, echoed
some powerful numbers posted in the past day by Corning, the
leading manufacturer of fiber-optic cable, and JDS Uniphase, a
rapidly growing producer of fiber-optic components.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the reports pointed to a continuation of the frenzied
spending on communications networks for electronic commerce --
regardless of the stock market's sudden cynicism about the Internet
revolution and profitless companies.
</P>
<P>
   ''Wall Street is going through quite a reassessment of values,''
said John Roth, president and chief executive of Nortel. But, he
added, ''There's a huge change in society taking place with regard
to the use of telecommunications. People are starting to realize
just how efficient they can make their organizations by using the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's all really coming, whether or not some of the dot-com
companies succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Notably, Nortel said in Tuesday's report that its prospects for
the year have grown even brighter. The company now sees its overall
market growing about 20 percent in 2000 instead of about 15
percent. Likewise, Nortel now expects full-year revenue growth of
30 to 35 percent rather than about 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel's shares rallied in advance of the report, which was
released after the close of Tuesday's regular trading, rising $13
per share to $111.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Corning, which blew past Wall Street forecasts after Monday's
close, jumped $26 per share to $177 in Tuesday's dealings on the
NYSE. JDS rose $13 to $93.31\ in advance of its report, which came
after Tuesday's close of the Nasdaq Stock Market.

   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- A Louisville attorney Tuesday dropped his
primary campaign against a woman vying to become Kentucky's first

   Jordan now has little opposition for the May 23 Democratic

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T-MediaOne Deal on the Move  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators are considering a staff
proposal that would pave the way for the merger of AT&AMP;T and
MediaOne, but only if the cable companies take certain steps to
ensure they don't have too much control over TV programming.
</P>
<P>
   The merger -- originally valued at $58 billion -- would create the
nation's largest provider of cable TV company and high-speed cable
Internet services. For that reason, critics have raised flags that
the combined business would gain a stranglehold on the programming
that reaches consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendation offered by the Federal Communications
Commission staff provides a roadmap for how the companies can
complete the merger while still complying with federal limits on
how many cable households one entity can reach. For example, the
report says the companies could sell MediaOne's 25 percent stake in
cable systems owned by Time Warner Inc. or separate themselves from
subsidiaries that sell programming to Time Warner, according to
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was sent to the offices of the five commissioners
last week. It may be included on the agenda for the commission's
May 15 open meeting, but a decision could come before then as well.
The commissioners may approve, reject or amend the staff
recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the plan were first reported in The Wall Street
Journal. The FCC and AT&AMP;T both declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   On a separate media merger, the five commissioners also are
looking at a recommendation from commission staff to approve
Viacom's acquisition of CBS, conditioned on certain divestitures
needed to comply with federal rules that limit the national TV
audience of a company to 35 percent. Combined, the two businesses
would reach 41 percent of the national audience.
</P>
<P>
   The companies had asked for two years to come into compliance
with commission rules, but the staff recommends giving them less
time then they had sought, according to an FCC source. It is
unclear when the five commissioners will decide on the matter.
Viacom declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Both deals also require the approval of the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   On the AT&AMP;T matter, the merger must comply with an FCC rule
prohibiting a single cable company from controlling more than 30
percent of the multichannel video market, which includes cable and
its competitors such as direct broadcast satellite. AT&AMP;T's deal
with MediaOne would fracture the cap, bringing it over 40 percent
of the market.
</P>
<P>
   But AT&AMP;T has argued that MediaOne's 25 percent stake in cable
systems owned by Time Warner Inc. is a ''limited partnership'' and
should not be counted toward the ownership cap, because it will be
insulated from the programming activity of Time Warner's cable
systems.
</P>
<P>
   One issue complicating that argument is that AT&AMP;T's wholly owned
subsidiary Liberty Media sells programming to Time Warner. But AT&AMP;T
says it has no control over Liberty's activities.
</P>
<P>
   According to The Journal, the staff report proposes that AT&AMP;T
could sever itself from Liberty. That would help fortify the
company's assertion that Time Warner is a limited partner.
</P>
<P>
   The staff report also gives AT&AMP;T a year to come into compliance
with the rules, less than the 18 months asked for by the companies.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates balked at this, saying commission rules only
give companies six months to come into compliance -- once a court
challenge to the rules are settled.
</P>
<P>
   ''To me, that's a big give to AT&AMP;T,'' said Gene Kimmelman,
co-director of the Washington office of Consumers Union. ''It is
really very troublesome. We will oppose anything that deviates from
rules of commission.''

<HEADLINE> America Wealthier, Sharing Less  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As America grows richer, the portion of U.S.
funds going to the world's poorest nations is headed for the lowest
level ever, according to two anti-poverty research groups.
</P>
<P>
   Other donating countries also are giving less aid in proportion
to their wealth, but they all are now ahead of the United States,
said the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in a report
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The center, which generally deals with domestic poverty issues,
is looking at U.S. nonmilitary assistance abroad for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's $10.7 billion foreign aid request
for fiscal year 2001 -- which Congress is likely to slash -- ties a
post-World War II low in the percentage of federal funds going to
foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   As a share of the overall budget, foreign aid would be 0.6
percent, compared to 0.92 percent in the 1980s. By 2003, under
current budget plans, it is expected to reach the lowest level on
record, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The report also contrasts the rising standard of living enjoyed
by Americans with poverty abroad. The average U.S. resident
receives 56 times the annual income of residents in the world's
low-income countries, it says.
</P>
<P>
   Isaac Shapiro, director of the center's international project,
said America can afford to provide more.
</P>
<P>
   ''The indicators on resources and standards of living show us in
a position to provide substantial assistance, and the needs remain
monumental,'' Shapiro said.
</P>
<P>
   Among data in the report:
</P>
<P>
   --The foreign aid budget request for 2001 represents 0.11 percent
of the U.S. economy. In the 1980s, the foreign aid budget request
averaged twice that. International conferences of government and
public interest officials have set 0.7 percent as a global goal.
</P>
<P>
   --Over the last decade for France, aid dropped from 0.59 percent
to 0.42 percent of gross domestic product, for Germany from 0.39
percent to 0.27 percent, for Japan from 0.31 percent to 0.25
percent and for Britain from 0.3 percent to 0.27 percent.
</P>
<P>
   --In per capita aid, the United States is last: $29 per U.S.
resident, compared to an average of about $70 in the other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on those conclusions, a report by the Overseas
Development Council says many U.S. aid programs have been
successful -- though not all. The council, which monitors issues in
developing countries, said declining aid hurts U.S. interests.
</P>
<P>
   It notes that U.S. agricultural development programs have been
hit especially hard, declining from $900 million in 1990 to $300
million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Other aid programs provide medicine, refugee assistance,
disaster relief, private sector development, democracy promotion,
environmental protection, family planning, and help in fighting
illegal drugs, terrorism and nuclear proliferation.

<HEADLINE> Couple Sentenced for Child Abuse  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLOUNTVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A former minister was sentenced to 114
years in prison Tuesday and his wife was given 65 years for
kidnapping and abusing a girl they took from an orphanage and
raised as a servant.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Joseph Combs, 51, and Evangeline Combs, 50, who were
convicted last month, took the child from the orphanage in Indiana
in 1978 but never adopted her.
</P>
<P>
   The victim, Esther Combs, now 22 and using a different name,
testified during the trial that Mrs. Combs beat her with baseball
bats, burned her with a curling iron and pulled out chunks of her
flesh with pliers -- causing more than 400 scars on her body. She
also said she was forced to do all the chores.
</P>
<P>
   Combs, the former pastor of the now-defunct Emmanuel Baptist
Church in Bristol, denied the allegations and testified that he was
''bewildered'' by Esther's claims. He said the couple meant to
adopt Esther but couldn't afford the financial demands from the
children's home in Valparaiso, Ind. Mrs. Combs didn't testify.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to kidnapping, Combs was convicted of aggravated
assault, aggravated perjury and rape. Mrs. Combs also was convicted
of aggravated child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Esther Combs gave a statement from the witness stand before Mrs.
Combs was sentenced.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just wanted to tell you how much you hurt me because I don't
think you fully understand how much damage you have really done to
me or that you even care,'' she said. ''But I had to say this to

wasn't anything.''

<HEADLINE> Elderly Prescription Costs Probed  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The cost of medicines used by many older
Americans rose faster than the rate of inflation last year, an
advocacy group said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Wholesale prices for 50 prescriptions frequently used by seniors
rose by 3.9 percent last year, reported Families USA, an advocacy
group that supports President Clinton's proposal to add a
prescription drug benefit to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Government figures show that the overall inflation rate at the
retail level was 2.7 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for all prescription drugs jumped 5.8 percent, government
figures show.
</P>
<P>
   Families USA zeroed in on medicines most important to seniors to
highlight what its officials say is the need for a broad drug
insurance program that will help all elderly Americans -- who are
living longer and whose doctors are increasingly treating with
drugs -- to deal with soaring prices at the pharmacy window.
</P>
<P>
   In the six-year period from January 1994 to January 2000, prices
rose 30 percent on average, according to the group's study, which
will be presented to President Clinton and Democratic congressional
leaders at a White House briefing Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This report underscores the importance of protecting seniors
from the growing burden of prescription drug prices,'' said Ron
Pollack, president of Families USA.
</P>
<P>
   Drug industry officials said the report exaggerated drug price
increases. A government measure of wholesale prices showed that
prices for all prescription drugs went up only 1.3 percent, said
Jackie Cottrell, spokeswoman for the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America, an industry group.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Families USA study, the wholesale price for a
year's supply of furosemide, a generic used to treat hypertension
and congestive heart failure, doubled to $57 in January when
compared with its price a year before.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of a year's supply of Klor-Con 10, used as a potassium
replacement, jumped nearly 44 percent to $286 from $199, the report
said. Yearly price increases for other drugs cited in the report
include:
</P>
<P>
   --Glucophage, a diabetes drug, rose to $708 from $661.
</P>
<P>
   --Procardia, a hypertension drug, increased to $901 from $874
</P>
<P>
   --Premarin, used for estrogen replacement, rose to $208 from
$186.
</P>
<P>
   The new report will be used as fodder to bolster Clinton's plan
to add drug coverage to Medicare as an option for all Americans age
65 or older. Administration officials say rising drug prices are a
problem for all seniors and want a broad plan -- $195 billion over
10 years -- for 39 million Medicare beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   They are locked in a heated debate with congressional Republican
leaders who believe drug coverage should go to low-income Americans
who need it most. Republicans say there's no reason to give drug
benefits to the millions of Medicare beneficiaries who already have
some type of coverage through HMOs or retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders earlier this month unveiled the outlines of a drug
proposal calling for private health plans to offer drug benefits
and government subsidies to pay drug costs for low-income seniors.
Most of the $40 billion they have earmarked for a five-year
overhaul of Medicare would go toward the drug plan, GOP lawmakers
said.

<HEADLINE> Gorbachev Says Putin Hard Worker  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN MATTHEWS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin lacks
experience but is a hard-working man who understands the importance
of the West, former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Putin is a new man in Russian politics,'' said Gorbachev, who
was a panelist at a forum assembled by media magnate Rupert
Murdoch. ''He doesn't have enough experience of statesmanship. At
the same time he is a serious and well-educated person. He is a
very hard-working person.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin, a former KGB agent who never held elected office until
last month's presidential vote, is viewed with some concern in the
West because of his hard-line positions on the war in Chechnya and
other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev said that while he supported former Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov, who dropped out of the election, he believes
Putin ''will be a serious partner who understands the importance of
the West, the importance of Europe and the importance particularly
of the United States for Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ''Our task now, the task of those who are committed to
the continuation of the democratic process ... is to help Putin, to
help Putin take the right stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev, who led the Soviet Union from 1985 until its 1991
collapse, made the remarks in a question-and-answer session with
reporters after participating in a panel discussion of global
expectations of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The panelists included Koichi Kato, former secretary general of
Japan's Liberal-Democratic Party and World Bank President James
Wolfensohn, who said the developing world expects the United States
to be an equal partner.
</P>
<P>
   A second panel was composed of four U.S. leaders: former House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, former Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin and Gen. Colin Powell, former chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   Both panels were moderated by former Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger and ranged widely over issues having to do with the role
of the United States in the post-Cold War world.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said the United States must change its foreign policy
style and learn ''to listen better, to be a partner rather than a
dominator.''

<HEADLINE> Russia May Expand Nuclear Doctrine  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- A top military official said Russia's new military
doctrine, which expands the conditions under which nuclear weapons
could be used, also applies to protecting allies, the Interfax news
agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The doctrine had raised concerns among some observers because it
says Russia could use nuclear weapons if other means to repel an
aggressor fail. Previous policy said nuclear weapons could be used
only if Russia's sovereignty was threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Gen. Valery Manilov, first deputy chief of the Russian
general staff, told a news conference that the policy also covers
aggression against allies, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Interfax did not specify what countries Manilov considers
allies. Russian officials have previously said that the so-called
''nuclear umbrella'' applies to Belarus, which has signed a treaty
with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Manilov rejected concerns that the new military doctrine
reflects an increasingly confrontational attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reverse is true. We regard all countries as potential
partners in upholding security and stability in the world,'' the
report quoted him as saying.

<HEADLINE> Gore Claims Clinton Economic Legacy  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore cast himself Tuesday as
the worthy inheritor of American confidence in the booming economy
and sought to shackle rival George W. Bush to his
president-father's ''amazing deficits.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's speech to the Association for a Better New York was the
first of a promised series of compare-and-contrast speeches meant
to pick apart Republican Bush's recent health, education and
environmental appeals to moderate voters -- proposals Gore derided
as a ''post-primary search for rehabilitation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic presidential candidate also hopes to cement the
core of his argument for claiming the White House after President
Clinton: that stewardship of the strong economy should go to him
because he has, in his words, the ''toughness, leadership and
experience to maintain it.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Gore's criticism, the Texas governor told
reporters that the Democrat was misrepresenting Bush proposals
because he was ''so anxious to become president that he will do
whatever it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   But in general Tuesday, Bush aimed for a contrast with Gore in
tone and philosophy, bringing Texas Democrats with him to campaign
in Ohio and asserting that bipartisanship is the key to success in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked into his own pitch on the economy was an implicit
criticism that the Clinton-Gore administration has neglected to
spread the wealth of the strong economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''In this campaign I have shared my goal of continuing our
economic success and expanding its blessings to reach all those who
live in the shadow of prosperity,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke of his plan that would give banks tax credits as an
incentive to promote savings accounts that low-income Americans
would use to finance homes, businesses and education. He said, ''I
want people to understand that in order to put the best public
policy forward ... it's going to require both Republicans and
Democrats to recognize the good ideas and to come together.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bush's appearance was meant as a show of bipartisan
bridge-building, Gore's lecture inside a hotel ballroom seemed
intended to showcase his mastery of fiscal and monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   By getting rid of budget deficits inherited in 1993 from
President Bush, the Clinton-Gore administration lowered interest
rates, Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   In real-life terms, he added, that means the average family will
pay $24,000 less over the life of a home mortgage and businesses
have seen investments grow by more than 10 percent for seven years
straight.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also did a bit of name-dropping, calling former Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin, who is deeply respected on Wall Street,
''my tutor.'' And, said Gore, ''You will find no greater supporter
than am I of Alan Greenspan,'' the Federal Reserve chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Gore darkly warned against the size of Bush's proposed tax cuts,
saying they would leave no room in the budget for improving
education, shoring up Medicare or paying down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   ''After emerging from the Bush-Quayle deficits and recessions,
should we really risk a George W. Bush deficit and a George W. Bush
recession?'' Gore asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just as we fell prey to the politics of illusion during the
decade of amazing deficits, now we have to avoid the politics of
illusion in the decade of amazing surpluses.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was, however, reminded of the risks of grounding his
campaign strategy in a fluid economy when a member of his audience
asked how he would ''use the stock market to the best advantage of
the American people'' given its recent volatility.
</P>
<P>
   He likened the situation to basketball players taking foul shots
against a backdrop of noisy, distracting fans.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over time, if we keep our focus on the fundamentals of a sound
economy then the markets are going to be fine and we shouldn't be
distracted by the movements of the markets way up or way down or
sideways,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls show that Gore and Bush are about evenly matched on
public trust that they can handle the economy, an area where Bush
once held a big advantage.
</P>
<P>
   In the Voter.com-Battleground Poll last month, Gore had closed
the gap a bit among men -- a group that had strongly supported Bush.
A key to the change, analysts said, was increased confidence that
he could continue the prosperity of the past seven years under the
Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving for Boston and another dinner to collect $750,000
for the Democratic National Committee -- Gore, President Clinton,
Hillary Rodham Clinton and Tipper Gore raised $2.2 million for the
party Monday night -- he gave interviews focusing on his economic
credentials to business publications including Business Week and
Money magazine.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, Gore said Bush's economic approach amounted to the
fallacy that ''we could have our cake and eat it too -- a la mode
with all the ice cream we wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Gore is expected to continue the drumbeat against
Bush with a speech in Hartford, Conn., attacking his health care
proposals. On Sunday in Boston, Gore's topic will be foreign and
defense policy.

<HEADLINE> Ala. Lawmakers Restrained at Debate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Two Alabama lawmakers exchanged curse
words and a punch was thrown before they were separated during a
debate on the House floor Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Skippy White threw a punch that brushed the arm of fellow
Democratic Rep. Alvin Holmes before other House members stepped
between them.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers disagreed over a resolution to study conditions at
a women's prison.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes supported the resolution, which was approved. White said
any complaints about the prison should be handled by the
Legislature's Joint Prison Oversight Committee, which he chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes said members of White's committee ''do nothing'' and
added: ''I don't care who gets mad. ... I'm not scared of nobody in
here.''
</P>
<P>
   White told House members after the scuffle he was ''sorry if I
embarrassed any of you. ... But when a member stands up and tells a
bald-faced lie to y'all, it's hard to accept it.''

<HEADLINE> Special Interests Help GOP Funds  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush's first fund-raising effort for
the Republican Party will collect a record $18 million at a
black-tie gala boasting a guest list that reads like a Who's Who of
interests with business before the government.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, the National Rifle Association and tobacco giant Philip
Morris are just a few of the companies and groups that will have
officials attending a private reception and then dining Wednesday
night with the presumptive presidential nominee and GOP lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 38 companies or individuals raised or donated at least a
quarter million dollars for the Republican National Committee
extravaganza, and an additional 16 shelled out at least $100,000,
according to a donor list obtained by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The previous record for a political party in a single night was
$14 million last year when Bush's father, the former president,
headlined the same gala.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a real strong statement about Governor Bush and how he's
exciting people all over the country,'' party chairman Jim
Nicholson said. ''People are willing not only to talk the talk but
walk the walk.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee is trying to muster a
financial answer. It has scheduled its own fund-raising bash next
month that will trade tuxedos and gowns for blue jeans and barbecue
at a Washington arena. Organizers expect to raise at least $7
million and hope to exceed that figure.
</P>
<P>
   That same night, May 24, congressional Republicans expect to
raise $8 million from a fund-raising dinner of their own, to be
divided between the House and Senate GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are committed, they are working hard,'' Gore warned
contributors at a $750,000 DNC dinner in Boston on Tuesday.
''They're going to throw everything including the kitchen sink into
this and they've got blood in their eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Both dinners planned for May 24 pale in comparison to the RNC
event being held at a National Guard Armory.
</P>
<P>
   Donors there will dine with Bush and Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott and House Speaker Dennis Hastert, leaders of the
Republican-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The quarter-million-dollar club includes:
</P>
<P>
   -- Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the National Rifle
Association, which opposes gun control legislation now before
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   -- Cigarette maker Philip Morris, which opposes efforts to allow
the Food and Drug Administration to regulate nicotine.
</P>
<P>
   -- Carl Lindner, whose Chiquita bananas have been at the center
of a trade dispute between the United States and the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
   -- US West, which is seeking federal approval to transmit data
over long distance lines.
</P>
<P>
   -- AT&AMP;T, which is trying to block that request.
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Becker, a lobbyist and political action committee
director for the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, is a
deputy chairman for the gala. She raised or contributed at least
$45,000.
</P>
<P>
   The giant health insurance association opposes pending
legislation to allow patients to sue their health plans.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have always believed in full participation in the political
process,'' association spokesman Bill Pierce said. ''That's what
our plans expect. Everyone else who has a stake in this debate
participates fully and so do we.''
</P>
<P>
   Political observers say the lobbyists helping to raise money now
will be asking for help later.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're going to be expecting something from their members on
behalf of their clients once the election is over,'' said Larry
Makinson, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics,
a research group that studies money and campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Republican officials said most of their money comes from small
donors who give an average of $55 each. Democratic officials
declined to release the size of their average donation.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP gala includes several of the fund-raisers who helped the
Texas governor amass a record $80 million for his presidential
primary.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the chairman is Sam Fox, who heads a Missouri
investment company and raised at least $100,000 for the Bush
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And one co-chairman, who raised or contributed at least
$250,000, is Kenneth Lay, head of the Texas-based energy giant
Enron Corp. Enron has been the biggest financial contributor of
Bush's political career, giving more than $500,000, according to
the watchdog Center for Public Integrity. Lay also has raised more
than $100,000 for Bush's presidential campaign.

<HEADLINE> Ex Hotel Workers To Stay in U.S.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLOOMINGTON, Minn. (AP) -- Seven former Holiday Inn workers at
the center of a deportation fight will be allowed to stay in the
United States for two years as part of an agreement announced
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   They were among eight workers from Mexico who were fired from
the Holiday Inn Express in Minneapolis after they tried to form a
union.
</P>
<P>
   The workers were detained Oct. 13 after the hotel manager
notified the Immigration and Naturalization Service that they were
in the country illegally.
</P>
<P>
   The workers alleged they were singled out by the hotel for their
union activities. Hotel officials said they reported the workers
over fears of being fined for knowingly employing illegal aliens,
not in retaliation for their union activity.
</P>
<P>
   After the workers' arrests, the National Labor Relations Board
and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission investigated the
hotel's actions and brought charges of unlawful discrimination and
unfair labor practices against Holiday Inn Express. The hotel
settled the case and paid each worker $8,000.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first major test of new commission policies meant to
protect all employees from discrimination, regardless of their
immigration status.
</P>
<P>
   Under Tuesday's agreement, the INS agreed to grant the workers a
temporary reprieve from deportation for two years and allow them to
work during that time.
</P>
<P>
   An eighth worker did not qualify for the exemption because he
had been previously deported from the United States and illegally
returned later.

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton signed a congressional
resolution Tuesday warning Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori that
Peru could face political and economic sanctions if international
monitors continue to report electoral irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   ''The democratic countries of this hemisphere are united in our
hope that the election be conducted in a transparent, peaceful and
statesmanlike manner,'' Clinton said in a statement from the White
House. ''Democracy is strengthened when all Peruvians have the
opportunity to debate and determine the future of Peru.''
</P>
<P>
   In Lima, Peruvian Foreign Minister Fernando de Trazegnies played
down Clinton's message, calling it ''nothing more than an
admonition and not a binding resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Presidential hopeful Alejandro Toledo on Tuesday accused
Fujimori and his supporters of dragging their feet on a proposed
pact to conduct a clean runoff election.
</P>
<P>
   But Toledo stopped short of saying he will pull out of the
second-round vote that will likely take place in late May or early
June.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori fell a hair short of the majority he needed to claim a
third term victory after the April 9 vote was tainted by
irregularities and accusations of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori has denied that election-rigging occurred and has
played down irregularities, saying they had no significant impact
on the vote outcome.

<HEADLINE> Tyson-ConAgra Trial Ruled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- A judge said Tuesday that Tyson Foods'
dispute with ConAgra over Tyson's formula for chicken feed should
be heard by a judge or jury.
</P>
<P>
   ConAgra, based in Omaha, Neb., maintains that the formula is not
a trade secret because its components could be determined by
chemical engineers and had asked a Washington County judge to
dismiss the case.
</P>
<P>
   Springdale-based Tyson Foods said that is not a valid argument,
because Tyson uses its feed formula in its operations only --
supplying it and poultry to its own growers -- and does not market
it.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor John Lineberger refused to grant ConAgra summary
judgment and said a trial should be held. Still pending is whether
a judge or jury will hear the case. Lineberger asked lawyers for
both companies to suggest how they want to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, the nation's largest poultry producer, sued ConAgra last
August, saying the food giant had exploited proprietary information
by hiring four Tyson executives.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Lineberger barred ConAgra from using three of the
executives in poultry positions for one year. The remaining portion
of the case involves how ConAgra came into possession of Tyson's
feed formula.
</P>
<P>
   The executives were dropped from the lawsuit, remaining involved
only as ConAgra employees.

<HEADLINE> Park Service May Limit Ssnowmobiles  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Park Service is moving to
restrict -- and possibly ban entirely in many parks -- the use of
snowmobiles, government and private sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Snowmobiles currently are allowed in more than 40 parks,
although conservationists have complained about their noise and air
pollution, especially as their popularity has grown in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   An announcement on ''measures to halt recreational use of
snowmobiles'' in national parks was to be made at a news conference
Thursday, the Interior Department said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest actions are aimed at halting ''the escalating
recreational use of snowmobiles'' within the national park system,
according to the department advisory.
</P>
<P>
   No additional details about the decision could be learned
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups and the National Parks and Conservation
Association, a private park advocacy group, have argued that the
Park Service for years has failed to enforce existing regulations
against recreational snowmobiling at many national parks.
</P>
<P>
   Under regulations dating back to the 1970s, the Park Service is
required to monitor off-road vehicle use -- including snowmobiles --
and prohibit such uses if it is determined that they are causing
environmental damage, said Kevin Collins of the National Parks and
Conservation Association.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Park Service has allowed virtually unrestricted
snowmobile use in many of the parks ''with almost no analysis of
environmental effects,'' said Collins.
</P>
<P>
   The decision dealing with snowmobiles is likely to affect many
of the 28 parks outside of Alaska where snowmobiling now takes
place, those familiar with the issue said Tuesday. But Alaska is
likely to be excluded from a snowmobile ban because parks in that
state are governed by a different set of regulations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Voyageurs National Park in Minnesota is likely
to be left out of the review because snowmobile use was
specifically permitted when Congress created that park, Collins
said.
</P>
<P>
   The following are park units outside of Alaska where
recreational snowmobiling is allowed, according to the National
Parks and Conservation Association:
</P>
<P>
   Appalachian National Scenic Trail; Acadia National Park in
Maine; Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area in Montana and
Wyoming; Blue Ridge Parkway in North Carolina and Virginia; Black
Canyon of the Gunnison National Park in Colorado; Cedar Breaks
National Monument in Utah; Crater Lake National Park in Oregon;
Curecanti National Recreation Area in Colorado;
</P>
<P>
   Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area in New Jersey and
Pennsylvania; Dinosaur National Monument in Colorado and Utah;
Grand Portage National Monument in Michigan; Grand Teton National
Park in Colorado; Herbert Hoover National Historic Site in Iowa;
John D. Rockefeller Memorial Parkway in Wyoming;
</P>
<P>
   Lake Chelan National Recreation Area, Mountain Rainier National
Park, North Cascade National Park, Olympic National Park, and Ross
Lake National Recreation Area, all in Washington state; Perry's
Victory and International Peace Memorial and Pictured Rocks

<HEADLINE> Investigator Doubts Serial Slayer  </HEADLINE>
By LUIS CABRERA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- A former Navy sailor who says he has killed more
than a dozen people around the world may be lying about three
Seattle slayings he says he committed, authorities said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Former USS Nimitz sailor John Eric Armstrong, 26, of Dearborn
Heights, Mich., has told Detroit police he strangled five
Detroit-area prostitutes and earlier killed 11 other people while
an active duty sailor aboard the aircraft carrier. The carrier was
based in Bremerton, 10 miles west of Seattle across Puget Sound,
during several years of his service.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong claims to have killed a transsexual and two women in
Seattle, but there are no bodies to back him up, a state criminal
investigator said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're actually thinking now that he hasn't done anything here,
because nothing he said remotely matches any (killing) we've got
here,'' said Dick Steiner, head of the Homicide Investigation
Tracking System, a division of the state Attorney General's Office
that tracks serial killers and rapists.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong is charged with five counts of first-degree murder and
three counts of assault with intent to murder in connection with
alleged Detroit-area crimes. Investigators in Seattle and worldwide
are trying to match Armstrong's accounts of other killings with
unsolved homicides in their areas.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's lawyer, Robert Mitchell of Detroit, agreed that his
client probably wasn't telling the truth about claims of killings
in Washington and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think all of those are just make-believe,'' he said. ''I
have certain reasons that I wouldn't want to reveal right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's preliminary hearing on one of the Detroit-area
slayings is Thursday. Mitchell said he plans to ask the judge for a
continuation so his client can get psychological testing.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a troubled person and confused,'' Mitchell said.

<HEADLINE> Lee Defense To Show New Evidence  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD BENKE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Lawyers for fired Los Alamos scientist
Wen Ho Lee have asked permission to show jurors nuclear secrets
once compared to ''pure gold'' but which the defense contends are
more like lead -- and readily available to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys told U.S. District Judge John Conway on Monday
that the materials Lee is accused of mishandling at Los Alamos
National Laboratory were not classified secret until after Lee was
fired last year.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 60, allegedly breached lab security by downloading material
from secured to unsecured computers and computer tapes. Prosecutors
have called the materials the ''crown jewels'' of American science.
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys said they need to present the files and tape as
evidence because it will show ''virtually all the information at
issue was either available in the open literature or could be
readily derived.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The defense ... will demonstrate that the files are mere lead;
that Dr. Lee protected them adequately in light of their limited
significance,'' attorneys Mark Holscher and John Cline said in
court documents.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the files contained flaws that would reduce their
usefulness to outsiders, and the material ''cannot be readily
interpreted or understood without the proper user manuals or
similar documents,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
   A message left for Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Gorence
seeking comment was not returned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 60, could face life in prison if convicted of all 59 counts
of breaching security. He is not accused of espionage. Trial is
tentatively set for Nov. 6.

<HEADLINE> Burlington Northern Profits Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp. said
Tuesday its first-quarter earnings rose 3 percent as increased
revenue from cargo shipping made up for higher fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth-based railroad reported net income of $243
million, or 55 cents a share, up from $236 million, or 50 cents a
share, a year ago. The earnings matched the expectation of analysts
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue rose by 2.5 percent, from $2.18 billion to $2.24
billion, the railroad said. The company reported gains in revenue
from intermodal, vehicle and agricultural commodity shipments,
helping overcome a 30 percent increase in fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite higher fuel costs, the company said it held operating
expenses to a 1 percent increase, at $1.73 billion, by lower
equipment rents, materials and other expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Burlington Northern is trying to merge with Canadian National
Railway Co. to form the largest railroad in North America. The
merger was dealt a setback in March, when the U.S. Surface
Transportation Board adopted a 15-month moratorium on rail mergers
because of service disruptions from recent mergers.
</P>
<P>
   Burlington Northern and Canadian have filed court appeals
protesting the transportation board's action.
</P>
<P>
   In trading Tuesday, Burlington Northern shares rose $1.12{ to
$25.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Urges Congo Peace Action  </HEADLINE>
By IAN JAMES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The warring parties in Congo are finally
holding to a cease-fire, a senior U.N. official told the Security
Council on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Kamel Morjane, the U.N. special representative for Congo, said
conditions were ripe for deploying a 5,500-member observer mission
to monitor the peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''The situation is better than it was before,'' Morjane told
reporters after briefing the council. ''I believe that this is
really a serious chance for the peace process, although we have to
continue working with the parties in order to consolidate this
hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebels took up arms in eastern Congo in August 1998 to oust
Congolese President Laurent Kabila from power. Rwanda and Uganda
backed the rebels, citing security concerns along their borders
with Congo, while Kabila enlisted the support of Angola, Zimbabwe
and Namibia.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a cease-fire agreement signed last July, fighting
persisted in the Central African country.
</P>
<P>
   On April 8, the warring parties agreed on a plan to implement
the cease-fire and pull back 10 miles from their front-line
positions. U.N. observers plan to monitor the 20 mile buffer zone
in the country, formerly known as Zaire.
</P>
<P>
   Morjane said he is hopeful all parties will allow for the
creation of the disengagement zone. The cease-fire has been holding
since April 16, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything can change at any moment, but certainly this is now
the time for us to act in order to avoid the vacuum,'' Morjane
said. ''This was my message to the Security Council today.''
</P>
<P>
   He said preparation for the deployment was under way, although
the United Nations was having trouble mustering the needed forces.
</P>
<P>
   The council president, Canadian Ambassador Robert Fowler, said
members of the council were buoyed by the positive news from
Morjane. But the council also heard a less optimistic briefing
Tuesday from a former president of Botswana, Ketumile Masire, who
is serving as a regionally-appointed facilitator in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem with the Congo is that it's promising now, but at
the next moment that promise, it completely changes,'' Masire said
after emerging from the council chamber. He said he was encouraged
by the ''convivial atmosphere,'' but he said he doesn't know how
long it will last.
</P>
<P>
   In Kampala, Uganda's defense minister, Stephen Kavuma, said
Tuesday that 2,000 troops of his troops have withdrawn from Congo
following a decrease in attacks by Ugandan rebels based in the
eastern party of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal is not connected to a peace agreement adopted
last July in Lusaka, Zambia that provides for the withdrawal of all
foreign armies fighting in Congo, Kavuma said.

<HEADLINE> Ramseys Not Taking Lie Detector Test  </HEADLINE>
By CATHERINE TSAI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- JonBenet Ramsey's parents no longer are willing to
take a lie detector test about her death because their lawyer and
Boulder police cannot agree on who would administer the exam.
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys wanted a company not associated with Boulder police
to administer the test, but Police Chief Mark Beckner said he
wanted the FBI to give it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to make sure if we do it, we do it right and with as
much protection built in as possible,'' Beckner said Tuesday, the
informal deadline he set for the Ramseys to take the test.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, John and Patsy Ramsey told ABC's Barbara Walters on
''20/20'' they would submit to an exam if the results were
publicized, if it were administered independent of the Boulder
police, and if it were conducted in their new hometown of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey attorney Lin Wood said Beckner's proposal to have the FBI
conduct the test was unfair because the FBI helped investigate
JonBenet's death.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anyone familiar with FBI polygraph exams recognizes it is not
really a primary tool for determining truth or deception,'' Wood
said Tuesday. ''It is designed as an investigative tool that is
used to intimidate and interrogate.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said Wood refused their offer to provide an FBI examiner
with no involvement or knowledge of the Ramsey case and who was
chosen without police involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Wood countered that he asked the FBI to oversee a polygraph exam
conducted by a non-FBI examiner. He also asked whether the FBI
would submit names of examiners not employed by the agency who were
nevertheless deemed to be qualified. Those requests were not
honored.
</P>
<P>
   No one has been charged in JonBenet's death on Dec. 26, 1996,
though police say the Ramseys remain under an ''umbrella of
suspicion.'' The Ramseys contend an intruder killed the 6-year-old,
who was found strangled and beaten in the basement of her parents'
former home in Boulder.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether the Ramseys would continue pushing to take a
lie detector test, Wood was doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   ''It serves no purpose for them to take an exam unless it is one
that will have an impact on the investigation,'' Wood said. ''Chief
Beckner has decided that the only one would be an FBI exam.''

<HEADLINE> EPA Refuses To Regulate Coal Waste  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Environmental Protection Agency late
Tuesday decided against regulating tons of ash and sludge from
coal-burning power plants as toxic hazardous waste, a victory for
utilities and a setback for environmental groups who have argued
the waste is contaminating water supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the EPA said it would issue federal standards for the
waste that will urge states to require liners at disposal sites and
regular monitoring of water sources near such sites, agency
officials said. Under this approach, the EPA could not require
state action, however.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists have complained that more than 100 million
tons of coal waste, laced with arsenic, mercury and other toxic
metals, is contaminating water supplies because of lax controls by
many states and no regulation from Washington. The utility industry
said the waste has not shown to be a health or environmental
threat.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this time, EPA does not believe that regulation of the
materials as hazardous waste is justified,'' Michael McCabe, the
EPA's acting deputy administrator, said in a statement. He said if
states and the industry do not take steps to ensure these wastes
are disposed of safely, the ''EPA will revisit the issue'' to
determine if more stringent regulations are needed.
</P>
<P>
   The issue could have a fallout in the presidential race. States
at the center of the controversy, including Texas, Ohio,
Pennsylvania and Michigan, also are important in the presidential
campaign. The four states are among the leaders in power plant
waste and environmentalists have singled out Texas for poor
enforcement of coal waste disposal.
</P>
<P>
   A senior EPA official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
that while the agency has decided against regulating the coal waste
as a hazardous substance, such action has not been ruled out
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ''We remain very concerned about the effects of these wastes on
public health and particularly ground water contamination,'' the
official said. He said if states are found not to follow the
federal guidelines ''it would be grounds for us to reconsider our
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jeff Stant of the Hoosier Environmental Coalition, an
Indiana-based group that has been active in the national movement
for tighter controls on coal ash, called the EPA decision ''a
horrendous mistake'' and said it affords little additional
protection since states can ignore the federal guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's outrageous to even suggest that coal waste that's full of
mercury and arsenic isn't hazardous,'' said Conrad Schneider, an
activist with the Clean Air Task Force, a coalition of groups that
have focused on pollution from coal-burning power plants.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups accused the EPA of ''backpedaling'' under
pressure from the business groups and utility industry that had
lobbied the White House and Congress against stricter regulations.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the EPA proposed that coal ash be treated as a
hazardous substance because of evidence that the waste may be more
hazardous than previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   But the draft proposal ran into stiff opposition from the Energy
Department and other agencies, prompting EPA Administrator Carol
Browner to try to seek a delay, despite a court order that had set
a Tuesday deadline for action.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the court order involved a lawsuit filed by a
citizen group in Oregon to seek tougher federal regulation of the
coal waste.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Thomas F. Hogan late Tuesday refused to give
the EPA any more time, prompting the agency to issue its decision a
few hours later.
</P>
<P>
   The electric utility industry maintains the coal ash -- often
dumped with no more safeguards than normal trash -- poses no threat
because of the low concentration of toxic metals. It also says
there is no clear evidence it is responsible for contaminating
waterways or underground aquifers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The damage cases that are out there most typically represent
past management practices. States are moving toward greater
control,'' insists Jim Roewer, an attorney for the Edison Electric
Institute, which represents investor-owned utilities. The group
estimates the stricter controls could cost utilities as much as $5
billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   But the Hoosier Environmental Council claims to have catalogued
64 sites around the country where coal waste has migrated into
underground aquifers or surface water because of inadequate
safeguards at coal ash dump sites. In many of the cases one or more
of the toxic substances in coal ash -- including mercury, arsenic,
cadmium and chromium -- had migrated into lakes, ponds or
underground water, the group says.
</P>
<P>
   While exempt from federal waste regulations, coal ash for years
has been regulated by states. Only 40 percent of the disposal sites
have liners and many of the states do not require monitoring of
groundwater or surface water near disposal sites, said John Stanton
of the National Environmental Trust. Texas, for example, requires
no monitoring of groundwater, nor a permit if waste is kept within
50 miles of a power plant, he said.

<HEADLINE> 2 Plead Innocent In Israeli Threat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Two men charged in connection with an alleged
threat to bomb the Israeli consulate in Montreal pleaded innocent
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects, both of Egyptian origin, were charged with
illegally possessing explosives found in a Montreal apartment last
month.
</P>
<P>
   One of the men, Ayman Bondok, also was charged with extortion
for allegedly threatening to bomb the Israeli consulate unless
Israel released Lebanese prisoners. The other, Tarek Adealy
Khafagy, faces a second charge of possessing counterfeit money.
</P>
<P>
   Khafagy, an Egyptian refugee, was arrested March 4 when police
acting on a tip about the March 1 telephone threat to the Israeli
consulate raided his apartment and found explosives and counterfeit
money. He has insisted he knew nothing about the contraband.
</P>
<P>
   His employer at a Montreal bakery said Khafagy had let a couple
stay in his apartment shortly before the arrest.
</P>
<P>
   On March 9, police arrested the couple -- Bondok and Kim St.
Louis, a Canadian woman -- on charges of possessing the explosives
found in Khafagy's apartment.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement to police, St. Louis said Bondok may have been
trying to set up Khafagy as part of a feud involving the two men's
families in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Bondok and Khafagy both waived their right to a preliminary
hearing Tuesday, and a trial date was set for Aug. 23. St. Louis
was not part of Tuesday's court appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Khafagy and St. Louis have been released on bail, while Bondok
remained in custody.

<HEADLINE> Teen Arrested in Zoo Shooting  </HEADLINE>
By DERRILL HOLLY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Police arrested a 16-year-old boy Tuesday and
charged him with a shooting at the National Zoo that wounded seven
youths and stunned visitors to one of the capital's most popular
tourist attractions.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager was taken into custody 24 hours after the shooting
at the home of a relative in Northeast Washington, Assistant Police
Chief Terrance Gainer said.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect was taken into custody without incident and a
shotgun was recovered at the scene, Gainer said. He was charged
with assault with intent to kill.
</P>
<P>
   Police Cmdr. Peter Newsham told a news conference authorities
would attempt to charge the youth as an adult. But police did not
identify the suspect because of his age.
</P>
<P>
   Officials had said the weapon used in the shootings was most
likely a 9mm handgun but none was found. But Gainer said he
believed ammunition used in a 9mm handgun was recovered.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation into the shootings continued but ''we're still
operating under the presumption there was one gunman, one gun,''
Gainer added.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings prompted calls Tuesday from local and federal
officials for stricter gun controls, but they insisted the National
Zoo and the capital's other tourist attractions are safe.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Anthony Williams said more must be done to reduce
teen-agers' access to guns and discourage them from resorting to
deadly force to resolve conflicts. ''Instead of reaching for a
bottle or a rock,'' as children used to do, ''you're now reaching
for guns,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton echoed that theme during a White House event
on hate crimes. ''It should be obvious that we can do more and we
must do more,'' Clinton said, calling the shootings ''a senseless
act.''
</P>
<P>
   But Williams and zoo officials said devices like metal detectors
would not be immediately added to the zoo when it reopens
Wednesday. ''I don't think that's called for,'' Williams said.
''It's certainly safe. This is a rare event.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven children between the ages of 11 and 16 were shot Monday
following a fight at the zoo, which was crowded with thousands of
people at an annual black family celebration.
</P>
<P>
   A high-ranking police official had said Monday and again early
Tuesday that doctors told him the most severely wounded, an
11-year-old boy, was brain dead. But Children's National Medical
Center said the child was never brain dead, his condition has
improved and he was responding to care. ''Although the child
remains in critical condition, a repeat CT scan of the head
continues stable,'' said Dr. Martin R. Eichelberger, director of
trauma services at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   A 12-year-old girl and 14-year-old boy were both in good
condition with wounds to the pelvis and leg, respectively. The
other children were hospitalized with lesser injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Although police say the fight involved two large groups of young
people, they have stopped short of labeling the violence
gang-related. ''It was one person with one weapon,'' said Cmdr.
Peter Newsham of the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP had offered a $25,000 reward for information leading
to an arrest and conviction in the case. A local crime solvers
program has also issued a $1,000 reward. Williams said the $1,000
reward would increase to $10,000 if the youngest victim dies.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately known whether any reward money was paid.
</P>
<P>
   Williams also said the shootings should not end the 100-year-old
tradition of black families gathering at the zoo on the Monday
after Easter. ''People ought to be able to visit any of our
monuments, any of our tourist attractions and feel safe and
comfortable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The zoo was closed on Tuesday but will reopen Wednesday. Zoo
officials discounted the need for metal detectors and increased
security when the zoo reopens. ''It's too early to consider any
measures like that,'' said Bob Hoage, a zoo spokesman. ''We still
need to get more information.''
</P>
<P>
   But officials admitted Tuesday their 14-member Smithsonian
Institution security detail may not be enough to cope with large
crowds attracted to the park for major events. ''We're trying to
put pieces of the puzzle together and to work with the metropolitan
police,'' Hoage said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, officials in the D.C. Public Schools sent 10 mental
health counselors to two of the city's 143 schools to help students
cope with the injuries to their classmates. Student Intervention
Director Diane Powell said counselors will be at the elementary
school attended by the most seriously injured student throughout
the week.

<HEADLINE> Hawaii Senate OKs Marijuana Bill  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE DUNFORD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU (AP) -- The state Senate approved a bill Tuesday
allowing people with certain debilitating illnesses, including AIDS
and cancer, to legally smoke marijuana to alleviate pain.
</P>
<P>
   The bill now goes to Gov. Ben Cayetano, who has said he'll sign
the measure into law.
</P>
<P>
   That would make Hawaii the eighth state to approve the medicinal
use of marijuana but the first to do so through legislation instead
of a voter referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Patients who want to smoke marijuana to alleviate pain, combat
chemotherapy treatments and stimulate appetite would require
written certification from a doctor and would have to register
annually with the state public safety department.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, already approved by the House, was approved by the
Senate through a 15-10 vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''This bill will protect from arrest both the patient who might
find a use for marijuana and the doctor who might recommend its
use,'' said Democratic Sen. Suzanne Chun Oakland, the chairwoman of
the Health and Human Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Norman Sakamoto, also a Democrat, opposed the bill, saying,
''We're approving something that the federal government says is
illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   Alaska, Washington, California, Arizona, Nevada, Oregon, Maine
and the District of Columbia have approved laws allowing doctors to
recommend marijuana use by patients suffering from cancer, glaucoma
and other conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department is challenging those laws.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Serbs Seek Refugee Return  </HEADLINE>
BY ALISON MUTLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Leaders of Kosovo's
dwindling Serb community called on international officials Tuesday
to speed the safe return of refugees to the province, amid
continued disputes over whether to cooperate with international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 100,000 Serbs now live in Kosovo, down from some
200,000 before the war which erupted last year between Yugoslav
forces and Kosovo's pro-independence ethnic Albanian Kosovo
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   But Kosovo's Serbs remain divided between moderates, who are
working with international institutions in the province, and more
hard-line leaders, who have stronger ties to Belgrade and refuse to
cooperate with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Ivanovic, who heads the Serb National Council in the
divided city of Kosvska Mitrovica, announced plans to return about
1,000 Serbs to all-Serb villages in western Kosovo in early June
and demanded international officials provide security and aid to
help the returnees.
</P>
<P>
   ''The international community has to do the same for the Serbs
like (they did) 10 months ago for the Albanians without any
preconditions to return us,'' said Ivanovic.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, moderate leaders Momcilo Trajkovic and Orthodox
Bishop Artemije told reporters that ''the international community
has displayed a lack of determination and willingness to ensure the
safe return of all Serb refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   There is pressure to start bringing back Serbs to create a
multiethnic society, although some international officials are
concerned that returning Serbs could stoke further tensions between
the communities. Ethnically motivated killings are still common and
most Serbs require escorts and peacekeeper protection.
</P>
<P>
   After NATO's 78-day bombing campaign, Belgrade accepted an
administrative U.N. mission and NATO-led peacekeeping force in the
province. International officials in Kosovo have sought to develop
multiethnic governing bodies as a way to ensure stability and
democracy, but ethnic divisions persist.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of relatives of 37 Serbs jailed by NATO-led peacekeepers
protested outside the prison Tuesday, demanding that trials of the
detainees be held immediately. They announced new protests for
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Park Service May Limit Snowmobiles  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Park Service is moving to
restrict -- and possibly ban entirely in many parks -- the use of
snowmobiles, government and private sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Snowmobiles currently are allowed in more than 40 parks,
although conservationists have complained about their noise and air
pollution, especially as their popularity has grown in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   An announcement on ''measures to halt recreational use of
snowmobiles'' in national parks was to be made at a news conference
Thursday, the Interior Department said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest actions are aimed at halting ''the escalating
recreational use of snowmobiles'' within the national park system,
according to the department advisory.
</P>
<P>
   No additional details about the decision could be learned
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups and the National Parks and Conservation
Association, a private park advocacy group, have argued that the
Park Service for years has failed to enforce existing regulations
against recreational snowmobiling at many national parks.
</P>
<P>
   Under regulations dating back to the 1970s, the Park Service is
required to monitor off-road vehicle use -- including snowmobiles --
and prohibit such uses if it is determined that they are causing
environmental damage, said Kevin Collins of the National Parks and
Conservation Association.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Park Service has allowed virtually unrestricted
snowmobile use in many of the parks ''with almost no analysis of
environmental effects,'' said Collins.
</P>
<P>
   The decision dealing with snowmobiles is likely to affect many
of the 28 parks outside of Alaska where snowmobiling now takes
place, those familiar with the issue said Tuesday. But Alaska is
likely to be excluded from a snowmobile ban because parks in that
state are governed by a different set of regulations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Voyageurs National Park in Minnesota is likely
to be left out of the review because snowmobile use was
specifically permitted when Congress created that park, Collins
said.
</P>
<P>
   The following are park units outside of Alaska where
recreational snowmobiling is allowed, according to the National
Parks and Conservation Association:
</P>
<P>
   Appalachian National Scenic Trail; Acadia National Park in
Maine; Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area in Montana and
Wyoming; Blue Ridge Parkway in North Carolina and Virginia; Black
Canyon of the Gunnison National Park in Colorado; Cedar Breaks
National Monument in Utah; Crater Lake National Park in Oregon;
Curecanti National Recreation Area in Colorado;
</P>
<P>
   Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area in New Jersey and
Pennsylvania; Dinosaur National Monument in Colorado and Utah;
Grand Portage National Monument in Minnesota; Grand Teton National
Park in Wyoming; Herbert Hoover National Historic Site in Iowa;
John D. Rockefeller Memorial Parkway in Wyoming;
</P>
<P>
   Lake Chelan National Recreation Area, Mount Rainier National
Park, North Cascades National Park, Olympic National Park, and Ross
Lake National Recreation Area, all in Washington state; Perry's
Victory and International Peace Memorial in Ohio; Pictured Rocks
National Seashore in Michigan; Rocky Mountain National Park in
Colorado; Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks in California;
Saint Croix National Scenic Riverway in Wisconsin; Theodore
Roosevelt National Park in North Dakota; Voyageurs National Park in
Minnesota; Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, Idaho and Montana;
Zion National Park in Utah.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Families Get Tape Copies  </HEADLINE>
By CATHERINE TSAI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- The Jefferson County Sheriff's Department gave
copies of videotapes of the Columbine shootings to a lawyer for the
families of six victims Tuesday, a day after a judge ordered the
handover.
</P>
<P>
   Although the families had no immediate plans to distribute the
tapes, the sheriff's office will make them available to the public
starting Wednesday, county attorney Frank Hutfless said in a
statement Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The families' lawyer, James P. Rouse, has said his clients
wanted to consult with other victims' families before releasing
anything to the public.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a judge ordered the sheriff's department to hand over
copies of the tapes, which include footage from school surveillance
cameras showing the two student gunmen opening fire in the
cafeteria last April 20.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen killed 12 students and a teacher and wounded 20
others before killing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also gave the department until May 15 to hand over
copies of the long-delayed final report on the incident. The report
was originally expected to be completed last fall. Officials'
latest estimate had the report coming out in late May.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will make every effort to put the report in final form by
May 15 so the document is not piecemealed to the general public,''
Hutfless said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, attorneys were looking for more information.
</P>
<P>
   ''Frankly what we're looking for now is the raw data the
sheriff's department used to prepare the report, including the
ballistics reports, witness statements,'' Rouse said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest court order could affect some aspects of his clients'
lawsuits, which allege the department ignored complaints against
the gunmen before the attacks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We expect to file an amended complaint in near future,'' Rouse
said. ''The allegations will probably remain the same, but we'll
add some different parties.''

<HEADLINE> Ala. Corruption Case Said Mistrial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A federal judge declared a mistrial
Tuesday after jurors said they couldn't reach verdicts in the
public corruption trial of a state senator and two former
legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mike Bearden, a Democrat, and former senators Mike Todd and
Steve Bell had been accused of scheming to profit illegally from
state programs intended to help children.
</P>
<P>
   The three defendants had been charged with seven others in a
133-count indictment alleging corruption. Prosecutors alleged the
defendants conspired to bilk state programs of at least $1.9
million.
</P>
<P>
   In November, former Sen. Nick Wilson was convicted of tax
evasion. He later pleaded guilty to racketeering in the current
case and is awaiting sentencing. Six others struck deals with the
government to avoid going to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Bearden's lawyer, Tim Dudley, said the mistrial was the
''second-best'' outcome for the defendants. He said he would ask
the judge to drop all charges.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors want to question the jurors before deciding whether
to retry the three.

<HEADLINE> Barbie Makes Leap to White House  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HARRIGAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) -- Barbie is ready to make the leap from
doll house to the White House. She comes with clothes, campaign and
cyber strategy.
</P>
<P>
   And, at 40, Barbie is now old enough, with a firm background in
economics ($1.5 billion in 1999 sales), to launch her ''President
2000 Barbie'' bid on the Barbie.com Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel Corp. previously offered a Barbie president doll in 1992,
when Barbie was still short of the minimum presidential age of 35.
</P>
<P>
   Her campaign 2000 has added some educational, Internet and
marketing forces -- although it will be 2008 or 2012 before many of
her devotees can vote for president.
</P>
<P>
   But the new doll has been brought to the attention of the White
House already.
</P>
<P>
   ''Barbie ... um ... can't think she's gonna have much of an
impact on the race unless they run Malibu Barbie and then maybe
California will be impacted,'' President Clinton's spokesman Joe
Lockhart joked in response to a reporter's question last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''President 2000 Barbie'' is outfitted in a blue suit for
campaigning and a red-and-white inaugural ball gown. The latest
incarnation of the doll goes on sale Monday at Toys R Us stores for
$19.99 including the two garments, bumper stickers, Barbie-sized
campaign placards, a plastic campaign button and related
educational material from Girls Inc. and the White House Project
for development of female leaders.
</P>
<P>
   President 2000 Barbie is the 75th career or lifestyle choice for
the 11{-inch-tall doll, which debuted in 1959. Her previous
experiences -- including an astronaut, doctor, teacher, Marine,
''Baywatch Barbie'' and baseball player (Dodger, Yankee or Cub) --
make her ''uniquely qualified for the nation's highest office,''
said Barbie spokeswoman Julia Jensen.
</P>
<P>
   Barbie's campaign to move ''from her 'dream house' to the White
House'' includes a seven-question Internet survey for kids to
participate. Results of the survey will be incorporated into
Barbie's campaign positions in July. Other planks already in place
cover equality, world peace, animal kindness, education and
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Among the survey's ''daily results' posted on the Barbie.com
site Tuesday were: Most important issue -- Protecting animals;
Biggest problem in the nation -- Too much crime; Biggest problem at
school -- Teasing and fighting.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A former police officer who admitted that he
accepted sexual favors and a place to nap as bribes to let a house
of prostitution operate in his Manhattan precinct was sentenced
Tuesday to six months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Buscarino, 35, was sentenced after he pleaded guilty to
third-degree bribery in a deal with prosectuors.
</P>
<P>
   A police officer for 13 years, Buscarino retired in November. He
was one of two dozen officers accused of protecting a brothel in

</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Andrew Heffner said the woman who
ran the brothel gave the officers thousands of dollars in cash,
airline tickets and jewelry, in addition to sexual services.
</P>
<P>
   Several other officers implicated in the scandal have pleaded

<HEADLINE> MGM Posts Quarterly Profit Again  </HEADLINE>
By GARY GENTILE, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The new management team at
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer produced the company's third straight quarterly
profit, aided by the appeal of one very bankable star: Brosnan,
Pierce Brosnan.
</P>
<P>
   MGM on Tuesday reported first quarter net income of $5.2 million
or 3 cents per share, compared with a loss of $306 million for the
same period last year. The company beat the expectations of Wall
Street analysts, who had expected a more modest profit of 2 cents
per share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   MGM Shares were up $2.12{ to $26.06\ on the New York Stock
Exchange on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the credit for the film studio's turnaround is
given to new chief executive Alex Yemenidjian and his team,
installed last year by investor Kirk Kerkorian, actor Brosnan could
share the spotlight for the company's latest results. It was record
income from the James Bond thriller ''The World is Not Enough'' and
the home video and DVD sale of last year's ''The Thomas Crown
Affair,'' movies starring Brosnan, that boosted MGM's income during
the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The studio achieved its results without any major film release
during the quarter. It didn't need one. Revenue increased 33
percent to $344 million from $195 million in the same quarter last
year largely because of the continued worldwide theatrical run of
''The World is Not Enough,'' the 19th installment in the Bond
series. The film is on track to earn more than $350 million, making
it the most profitable Bond film ever, executives said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bond franchise also produced income from the release of the
interactive game version of ''Tomorrow Never Dies.''
</P>
<P>
   The first quarter also saw increased revenue from MGM's vast
film library and its interactive division.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a particularly significant quarter, since our
company's operating earnings demonstrate our ability to generate
positive results even in the absence of major film releases in the
period,'' Yemenidjian said.
</P>
<P>
   The company predicted profits would continue to increase with
the release this year and next of movies such as ''Hannibal,'' the
sequel to ''The Silence of the Lambs,'' and ''Cold Mountain,''
based on the best-selling novel.
</P>
<P>
   The company also recently expanded a deal with the Showtime
cable network to air its films and produce three new original
series.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks slipped early Wednesday following
gains in technology shares on Wall Street. The dollar was higher
against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 38.02 points,
or 0.21 percent, to 18,234.31 in the first one hour of trading. On
Tuesday, the average closed down 207.82 points, or 1.12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 106.14 yen, up 0.78 yen from late Tuesday in
Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 105.81 yen.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, prices opened higher led by major
information technology blue chips after the Nasdaq composite index
rose 228.75 to 3,711.23 at Tuesday's finish. But after a round of
buying, prices moved into negative territory.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the

</P>
<P>
   Also in New York on Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average
rose 218.72 points to close at 11,124.82.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar gained further ground in Tokyo
in line with its trend in New York, where the greenback
strengthened amid higher U.S. stocks
</P>
<P>
   Traders said the dollar's relative strength against the euro
also led to its firmness against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The euro has come under pressure in recent weeks amid questions
over how European authorities will defend the currency.
</P>
<P>
   The euro was traded at 97.18 yen, down from 98.65 yen late
Tuesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose

   CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) -- Carey Hoyt Bostian, the popular
genetics professor who became the seventh chancellor at North
Carolina State University in 1953, died Saturday. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   He was a teacher and administrator at NCSU for 43 years.
</P>
<P>
   Bostian was chancellor from 1953 to 1959 and presided over a
multimillion-dollar expansion of NCSU. He launched a faculty senate
that gave professors more say in academic affairs and helped
persuade then-Gov. Luther Hodges to create Research Triangle Park.
</P>
<P>
   Bostian quit as chancellor to return to teaching after growing
tired of academic politics. He created three of the most popular
genetics courses on campus.
Vic Condiotty:
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Vic Condiotty, a master at recognizing great
photographic opportunities, imagining others and making them happen
in 41 years with The Seattle Times, died Monday following a stroke.
He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   He won numerous awards for an unposed picture that showed a
blind woman kneeling at the curb over the body of her guide dog,
which had just been killed by a motor vehicle, while a police
officer stood over her.
</P>

   Often, though, he would arrange shots such as Bob Hope lying on
the ground with a teed-up golf ball between his teeth while a
trained ape took aim with a club, or a caterer tossing a salad 500
feet above the ground at the edge of the unfinished Space Needle.
</P>
<P>
   At his retirement in 1988, colleagues described him as ''the
Cecil B. DeMille of journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   He joined the Coast Guard during World War II and was assigned
to photograph Marine invasions in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his sons Steve, Bruce, Paul and Jeff; a

Al Zampa:
</P>
<P>
   SAN PABLO, Calif. (AP) -- Al Zampa, a man who survived a fall off
the Golden Gate Bridge and worked on Northern California's most
famous bridges, died Sunday. He was 95.
</P>
<P>
   Three generations of Zampa's family, starting with him, helped
construct three generations of the Carquinez bridge, just northeast
of the San Francisco Bay.
</P>
<P>
   When Zampa's Crockett-area meat market went under in 1924, a
customer convinced him to give the area's burgeoning
bridge-building trade a try, and Zampa went to work on what was to
become the first Carquinez bridge, completed in 1927.
</P>

<HEADLINE> John McCain Returns to Vietnam  </HEADLINE>
By GREG MYRE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) -- Shaking hands with crowds of Vietnamese, a
nostalgic John McCain returned Tuesday to the Hanoi lake where in
1967 he was dragged ashore and beaten after parachuting from his
downed warplane.
</P>
<P>
   The bitter war has yielded to reconciliation, and the Arizona
senator strolled with his family around the busy shorefront of the
capital's Truc Bach lake, stopping at a sidewalk memorial marking
his rescue.
</P>
<P>
   ''I put the Vietnam War behind me a long time ago,'' McCain said
upon arriving in Vietnam on Tuesday. ''I harbor no anger, no
rancor.''
</P>
<P>
   People on the street seemed to feel the same. A crowd of
Vietnamese gathered around McCain as he walked, greeting him as a
friend and shaking his hand.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who spent more than five years as a prisoner of war
here, is now a leading proponent of rebuilding relations with the
impoverished communist nation.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam celebrates the 25th anniversary of the end of the war on
Sunday, and the former presidential candidate is the most prominent
of the numerous returning U.S. veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ''My job here is to commemorate the beginning and continuation
of a new relationship between the United States and Vietnam,'' said
McCain, who was instrumental in restoring formal ties five years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his seventh to Vietnam since 1975 was filled with war
reminders.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after he arrived, McCain attended a solemn airport
repatriation ceremony in which an 11-person military honor guard
placed six small boxes of remains, believed to be from U.S.
servicemen, into silver metal coffins.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 U.S. civilians and military personnel watched as the
containers were draped with American flags and carried into the
hold of a C-17 cargo plane heading to Hickam Air Force Base in
Hawaii for forensic analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The remains were recovered this year as part of the ongoing
American effort to account for more than 2,000 servicemen missing
in Indochina, including about 1,500 in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Several hours later, McCain took wife Cindy and son Jack on a
walk along the bustling sidewalk that borders the lake, and briefly
recounted the downing of his A4 plane during a bombing mission Oct.
26, 1967.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything happened very quickly,'' he said. ''I broke both my
arms and a leg, and I was dragged ashore and I was beaten.''
</P>
<P>
   Did he think he would survive?
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't sure. In a situation like that, you never know,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, McCain will visit Hoa Lo Prison -- the ''Hanoi
Hilton,'' as POWs called it, where he spent his years in captivity.
He has said his hardships there included beatings, a lack of proper
medical treatment for injuries, and a total of three years in
solitary confinement for what his captors called a ''bad
attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   He twice tried to hang himself, using his shirt as a noose, but
was caught both times by the guards, who then beat him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't control my despair,'' McCain wrote in his
autobiography. ''All my pride was lost, and I doubted I would ever
stand up to any man again. Nothing could save me.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, McCain, who visited the prison on a previous trip,
recalled his time in captivity. ''I had the privilege of serving in
the company of heroes,'' he said. ''I observed a thousand acts of
courage, compassion and love and I will always treasure that memory
above all others.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the prison was torn down in 1993 to make way for Hanoi
Towers, an upscale office complex and hotel in central Hanoi. One
wing of the faded yellow fortress was preserved and opened as a
museum three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   One cell is devoted to the 300 American prisoners and includes a
photo of a young McCain with several days' worth of beard stubble.
The Vietnamese have a rather different take on the men's life in
captivity.	   ''Though having committed untold crimes on our people, American
pilots suffered no revenge once they were captured and detained,''
the exhibit says. ''Instead, they were well-treated with adequate
food, clothing and shelter.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit includes a volleyball net used by the prisoners. One
photo shows an American POW clinking glasses at a meeting with
Vietnamese journalists. Another features Americans cheerfully
preparing a meal.
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnamese government has in the past rankled at McCain's
accounts of his time in captivity, denying his allegations of
torture at the hands of prison guards.
</P>
<P>
   During his unsuccessful presidential bid this year, McCain also
raised the ire of some Asian-American groups when he said he and
his fellow Americans referred to their captors with the derogatory
term ''gooks.'' McCain refused calls to apologize for his language.
</P>
<P>
   ''John McCain's words and statements, which lack goodwill, have
hurt the Vietnamese and Asian peoples,'' Vietnam Foreign Ministry
spokesman Phan Thuy Thanh said in February at the height of the
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   McCain held a friendly meeting Tuesday with Foreign Minister
Nguyen Dy Nien with no mention of the controversy.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Sean Bergman took a shutout into the seventh
inning as the Minnesota Twins won for the seventh time in eight
games, 6-1 over the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Bergman (2-0) allowed one run, four hits and six walks in 6
1-3 innings. Bergman walked Scott Brosius with one out in the
seventh and then gave up a single to Wilson Delgado.
</P>
<P>
   Miller came in and gave up a pinch-hit single to Jim Leyritz to
load the bases and a sacrifice fly to Derek Jeter. But that was all
the Yankees would get as they lost for the fourth time in five
games.
</P>
<P>
   Jacque Jones, who lost a fly ball in the sun Monday that almost
cost the Twins the opener of the series, drove in two runs and Ron
Coomer also had two RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Walker and Cristian Guzman gave the Twins a 2-0 lead in the
third inning with back-to-back homers off Ramiro Mendoza (2-2).
</P>
<P>
   Jones made it 3-0 with an RBI single in the fourth, scoring
Marcus Jensen who had doubled with two out.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota added two more runs in the sixth on Jones's RBI single
that knocked out Mendoza and Torii Hunter's RBI groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza (2-2), making only his third start of the season,
allowed five runs on and eight hits in 5 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Coomer's RBI single in the seventh gave the Twins an insurance
run.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Minnesota's Matt Lawton extended his career-high hitting
streak to 12 games with a first-inning single. ... Twins are only
7-6 when they score the game's first run. ... Derek Jeter has been
the Yankees only starting No. 2 hitter this season having started
all 19 games batting second. ... Mendoza had allowed only one homer
in his first four games before giving up two in the third. ...
Brosius was 0-for-3 with a walk in his first game since opening day
when he was sidelined with a rib cage injury. Alfonso Soriano was
sent down to Triple-A Columbus to make room for Brosius.

<HEADLINE> Czech Square Named After Kafka  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- City councilors named a square
after Prague's literary son, Franz Kafka, on Tuesday despite
earlier protest from the district's mayor who said the move would
have terrified the writer.
</P>
<P>
   The small plaza in the heart of downtown, just off the famous
Old Town Square, was named after Kafka because his house stood
there before it was demolished in 1911.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor of the first district, Jan Buergermeister, protested
the proposal in February, arguing that naming a square after Kafka
would go against the very essence of the writer's work. Kafka is
best known for his absurd novels like The Trial or The Castle.
</P>
<P>
   Kafka was born in Prague in 1883 and wrote in his native German
language. He was one of the best-known Czech authors of early 20th
century.

<HEADLINE> Mets 6, Reds 5  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER, AP Baseball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Derek Bell, robbed of a home run earlier by Ken
Griffey Jr., homered to spark a seventh-inning rally that sent the
New York Mets over the Cincinnati Reds 6-5 Tuesday night for their
ninth straight victory.
</P>
<P>
   Edgardo Alfonzo and Robin Ventura also homered for the Mets,
whose winning streak is their longest since they took nine in a row
in May 1998. The Reds have lost four straight for the first time
since September 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Mets shortstop Rey Ordonez and third base coach Cookie Rojas
were absent, honoring a call by Cuban-Americans to protest the
Elian Gonzalez case. Reds outfielder Alex Ochoa, whose parents were
born in Cuba, decided to play.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, who blocked a trade last winter that would have sent
him from Seattle to the Mets, was greeted mostly by boos from the
27,153 fans -- the smallest crowd to see Junior this season.
</P>
<P>
   Playing at Shea Stadium for the first time, Griffey had a quiet
night at the plate. He struck out twice chasing high fastballs from
Al Leiter and walked twice.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey struck out looking in the ninth against Armando Benitez
with two outs and a runner on first to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   But the 10-time Gold Glove center fielder made the play of the
night, racing into the alley in left-center and reaching above the
wall to catch Bell's bid for a leadoff homer in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, however, got even by hitting a drive where no one could
grab it. He opened the seventh with a homer to left that tied it at
5.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, just picked as NL Player of the Week, looked completely
comfortable in the throwback uniforms the teams wore from 1969. He
prefers a baggy fit, and wore these well.
</P>
<P>
   Edgardo Alfonzo followed with a single off Scott Sullivan (0-1)
and Mike Piazza hit his second double of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Williamson relieved and, after throwing three balls to
Robin Ventura, intentionally walked him to load the bases. Jon
Nunnally then walked on four pitches, too, to force home the
go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   Turk Wendell (2-0) stopped the Reds' four-run rally in the
sixth. Benitez walked Sean Casey to open the ninth before striking
out Pokey Reese, Michael Tucker and Griffey to earn his eighth
save. The Mets won for the 11th time in 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza and Ventura doubled for a 1-0 lead in the second off
rookie Rob Bell. Alfonzo hit a two-run homer and Ventura also
connected in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter pitched for the first time since his wife, Lori, gave
birth to the couple's third child, Jack, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ochoa had an RBI grounder in the Reds third. Cincinnati scored
four times in the sixth for a 5-4 lead, keyed by pinch-hitter Mark
Lewis' two-out, two-run single that finished Leiter.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Melvin Mora started in place of Ordonez and made a couple
of neat plays. Bench coach John Stearns replaced Rojas. ... Griffey
always did well at Yankee Stadium, hitting 18 home runs with 50
RBIs in 230 at-bats. ... Reds SS Barry Larkin, put on the 15-day
disabled list Saturday because of an injured finger, said he
expects to be out at least three more weeks. ... Leiter beat
Cincinnati 5-0 in last year's one-game playoff for the NL wild-card
spot. ... Actor Dennis Quaid, who stars in the upcoming movie
''Frequency'' that makes reference to the Mets' 1969 World Series
season, threw out the first pitch.

<HEADLINE> Agent: Titans Release Wortham  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Tennessee Titans have released
starting middle linebacker Barron Wortham, his agent confirmed
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Titans coach Jeff Fisher called Wortham and told him he was
being released by the AFC champions from the remaining two years of
his four-year, $8.4 million contract, agent Scott Casterline said.
</P>
<P>
   Titans spokesman Tony Wyllie said he could not confirm or deny
Wortham's release.
</P>
<P>
   Wortham, 31, was a sixth-round draft pick from Texas-El Paso in
1994 by the then-Houston Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   Casterline said it appears the Titans are overloaded at
linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee signed free agent Randall Godfrey earlier this year
and took three linebackers, including first-round pick Keith
Bulluck of Syracuse, in the recent NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1999 regular season, the 5-foot-11, 245-pound Wortham
made 81 tackles, recovered three fumbles and made five
tackles-for-loss.

<HEADLINE> China Faces Export Challenge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- China faces a new challenge in export
markets against recovering Southeast Asian economies whose devalued
currencies are making their products more competitive, the Asian
Development Bank said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the recovery of Southeast Asia from the worst economic
crisis in a generation has also provided China with stronger export
markets, if the consumers in neighboring countries start spending
again, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
   In its annual survey of the region, Asian Development Outlook
2000, released in Bangkok, the Manila-based bank said that China
was insulated from the Asian economic crisis much better than its
neighbors, thanks to its controls on capital and stronger external
financial position.
</P>
<P>
   Yet concern among foreign investors over risks arising from weak
financial institutions in China are having an effect on the
economy, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign direct investment reached a plateau from 1995 through
1998, the report said, but for the first time since 1990 began to
decline last year. In 1999, commitments dropped by 19 percent and
actual foreign direct investment fell 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With the Southeast Asian countries that were battered by the
economic implosion in 1997 now recovering, the report noted that
there have been fears that China would in turn face an economic
downturn.
</P>
<P>
   Economic growth is expected to fall to a still robust 6.5
percent in 2000, yet that remains down from 7.1 percent in 1999 and
7.8 percent in 1998, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
   The bank said that China ''has many similarities to the
crisis-affected nations, such as high corporate debt-equity ratios,
high ratio of non-performing loans on banks' balance sheets and the
exposure of banks to a sagging property sector.''
</P>
<P>
   But figures on inflation, short-term capital flows and the size
of short-term external debt in comparison to foreign exchange
reserves are much stronger and suggest China is not too vulnerable,
the bank said.
</P>
<P>
   Mass layoffs of workers from state-owned enterprises and
uncertainty over cutbacks in housing, pension and other social
provisions have led to weak consumer demand and deflation in China,
the report said.

<HEADLINE> Asian Financial Reform Push Wanes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- With their economies climbing out of
the crisis that rocked the region three years ago, Asian nations
are becoming complacent about putting painful but necessary reforms
into effect, the Asian Development Bank said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite pressure from international financial institutions that
bailed out some of the worst-hit countries, restructuring in
corporate and financial sectors has slowed, and some nations are
backsliding, the bank said in its annual survey forecasting
regional trends.
</P>
<P>
   ''The biggest risk facing the region is complacency,'' said the
report, Asian Development Outlook 2000, which was released in
Bangkok. ''As markets recover and foreign investors return, the
momentum for further reforms is weakened.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Manila-based bank is generally optimistic about growth
over the next two years, it said Asia's corporate and financial
sectors remain riddled with ''substantial problems'' and success is
not assured.
</P>
<P>
   A number of interests, such as big business, labor unions and
politicians, are trying to hamper reforms, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   The bank stressed that Asia's short-term recovery and future
depend on how effectively financial and corporate sectors can be
overhauled.
</P>
<P>
   Asia's hardest-hit large economies -- South Korea, Indonesia,
Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines -- must speed up disposing of
bad bank loans and developing fledgling capital markets, the report
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the rapid rebound from the recession of 1997 and
1998 to recovery last year was nothing short of ''impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Fueled by strong demand and favorable global economic
conditions, Asia's economy will continue to be the fastest-growing
in the world,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Growth in developing Asia -- which excludes Japan, Australia and
New Zealand -- is forecast at 6.2 percent this year, a more bullish
projection than the 5.5 percent the bank made late last year.
Growth in Southeast Asia in 2000 is forecast at 4.6 percent after
3.2 percent last year, with the positive trend supported by a boom
in the electronics industry.
</P>
<P>
   Growth in Asia's industrialized economies -- South Korea, Taiwan,
Hong Kong and Singapore -- is projected at 6.5 percent in 2000 after
7 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The bank said that major factors on Asia's growth prospects will
be the severity of a correction in U.S. asset prices, the strength
of an upswing in the European Union and prospects for recovery in
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   A big worry for the crisis-hit countries remains the enormous
stock of bad bank loans. While progress has been made, the ADB
warned that recovery could ''dull the momentum'' for further
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   The bank said South Korea and Malaysia have gone furthest to
restructure their corporate and financial sectors, while Indonesia
lags.
</P>
<P>
   The ADB's assessment of the success of reforms three years after
the outbreak of the financial crisis was guarded.
</P>
<P>
   Many countries have introduced new accounting standards,
improved disclosure requirements and better rules for corporate
governance. But effective implementation and enforcement are still
lacking.
</P>
<P>
   Asia's emerging markets also need to establish a modern
regulatory framework and reduce red tape and corruption-prone
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   The bank concluded that the market is confident that Asia will
emerge from the crisis with a stable and efficient financial
sector. But it was unclear whether some countries have the
political leadership and institutions to implement such massive
reforms in a short time.

<HEADLINE> N. Korea Singled Out at Conference  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- North Korea has been singled out for
criticism at a conference on nuclear nonproliferation and named as
the reason the United States wants to build a missile defense
system.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea is among the 187 countries that have committed
themselves to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which allows the
International Atomic Energy Agency to make sure a countries'
nuclear technology is being used for peaceful purposes.
</P>
<P>
   But North Korea has limited IAEA access to its facilities,
prompting the head of the IAEA, Mohamed El Baradei, to tell a
conference reviewing the treaty that the agency couldn't be sure
North Korea hadn't diverted technology to non-peaceful uses.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. official, meanwhile, raised concern Tuesday that
North Korea could launch an intercontinental ballistic missile
within the next five years -- before the United States could mount a
missile defense system against it.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea launched a three-stage Taepondong missile in 1998,
with a range of over 940 miles, and is ''very close'' to an even
more advanced missile, said John Holum, a senior U.S. adviser on
arms control.
</P>
<P>
   That 1998 test spurred the United States to begin considering a
missile defense system to guard against attack, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, which ratified the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty
with the United States barring such systems, has rebuffed U.S.
efforts to amend the treaty to allow a limited defense, arguing it
would make Russian forces ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   The United States says the missile defense system isn't intended
to counter Russian missiles, but to eliminate the smaller threat a
nation such as North Korea could pose.
</P>
<P>
   Pyongyang has agreed for the time being not to conduct a flight
test of the more advanced Taepondong-2 system, Holum said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nevertheless, the intelligence analysis is that North Korea is
very close to an ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile)
capability through that system, much closer to an ICBM capability
than we are to deployment of a national missile defense,'' Holum
said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. consideration of a missile defense system has dominated
the opening days of the conference, but North Korea's
non-compliance with the treaty has figured prominently in several
speeches as well.
</P>
<P>
   Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer welcomed recent
improvements in relations between Pyongyang and other countries in
the Asia-Pacific region, an apparent reference to plans by leaders
of North and South Korea to hold an unprecedented summit in June.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope this will be reflected in reduced tensions in the
region and improved North Korean cooperation with the IAEA,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Downer stressed that North Korea had solid commitments with
the IAEA regarding information about its nuclear facilities that
needed to be turned over.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Exiles Complain of Care  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- The Dalai Lama's supporters are charging
that China has damaged Tibet's environment through careless
exploitation of oil, water and timber resources.
</P>
<P>
   Water ''is now severely polluted by chemical nuclear and
industrial waste,'' said the 160-page study of the impact of 41
years of Chinese rule in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   Based on reports from refugees, occasional Western visitors and
Chinese news articles, the report was prepared by the Dalai Lama's
exile government for presentation to the U.N. Commission on
Sustainable Development on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The report seeks international action to pressure China ''to
ensure Tibet's ecology and culture are protected.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese troops occupied Tibet in 1950, claiming it needed to be
liberated from feudalism. After a violent Tibetan uprising in 1959,
the Dalai Lama fled into exile in India, from where he continues to
fight for Tibetan autonomy as a political and spiritual leader.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many Tibetan refugees have been eye witnesses to the People's
Liberation Army brigades venturing out in hunting parties to
machine-gun down herds of wild animals,'' said the report.
''China's PLA soldiers stationed in Tibet often dynamite rivers and
lakes to catch fish.''
</P>
<P>
   The report quotes Chinese news articles through 1997 as
referring to plans to dam the great bend in the Yarlung Tsangpao
River, to produce exportable electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese foreign ministry had no immediate comment on the
report. In the past, china has defended its rule over Tibet, saying
it freed serfs and slaves and brought economic development to a
poor, remote region.
</P>
<P>
   The exile administration's report says that China has dumped
nuclear waste in Tibet, stores missiles underground near the
capital, Lhasa, and tests anti-missile laser weapons in Tibet
because of it's high altitude.
</P>
<P>
   It also quotes a statement from the Chinese-controlled Tibetan
government, published in the Tibetan Daily in 1997, as saying that
41.9 million tons of waste liquid had been discharged into the
Lhasa River in 1996, more than half of it from industrial sources.

<HEADLINE> Giants 6, Marlins 4, 11 Innings  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LONG, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- With much of the focus on a Cuban-American boycott,
Armando Rios doubled in the 11th inning Tuesday night to give the
San Francisco Giants their fourth straight win, 6-4 over the
Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Mirabelli, the only Giants catcher in uniform, snapped an
0-for-18 streak with a one-out single off Dan Miceli (2-1) in the
11th. He moved to second on a wild pitch and scored on Rios'
double. Bill Mueller added a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Gardner (2-1) pitched the final two innings for the win.
</P>
<P>
   The game had eight players sitting out as part of a work
stoppage by Miami's Cuban-American community. They protested Elian
Gonzalez's removal from the home of his relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Florida third baseman Mike Lowell, pitchers Alex Fernandez and
Vladimir Nunez -- all of Cuban descent -- decided to sit out.
Dominican teammates Antonio Alfonseca, Jesus Sanchez and Danny
Bautista joined them in a show of support.
</P>
<P>
   Giants manager Dusty Baker advised right-hander Livan Hernandez
and catcher Bobby Estalella not to come to the ballpark as well,
fearing for the safety of their family members who live in South
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants did just fine without them. It hurt the Marlins. With
only 19 players available, starting pitcher Brad Penny was forced
to pinch hit in the 11th.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins tied it at 4 in the ninth, scoring twice off Robb
Nen. The Giants closer struggled to find the plate. He walked two,
including pinch-hitter Derrek Lee to lead off the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Lee moved to third on an infield single and an error by first
baseman J.T. Snow, who bobbled Mark Kotsay's hard-hit grounder and
overthrew Nenn at the bag.
</P>
<P>
   With runners on the corners, Mark Smith's sacrifice fly pulled
Florida within one. Pinch-hitter Cliff Floyd drew a walk, and an
error on third baseman Bill Mueller loaded the bases with one out.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Millar followed with a sacrifice to tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis Burks gave the Giants much of their early offense. He went
2-for-5 with a homer, his third of the season. All three have come
at Pro Player Stadium. Burks improved to 6-for-14 against Florida
this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants took a 3-0 lead in the third inning with three
unearned runs.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs and runners on first and second, Jeff Kent popped
up to short center field. Second baseman Pablo Ozuna seemed to be
under the ball, but had to lunge for it at the last second and
missed.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Meuller scored from second, and then shortstop Alex
Gonzalez dropped Ozuna's throw to second, allowing Barry Bonds to
score. Burks followed with an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   All three runs came against Florida starter Ryan Dempster. Burks
homered to center field to lead off the sixth, giving San Francisco
a 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins, who scored a run in the third, added a run in the
sixth when Dave Berg doubled home Smith before reliever Felix
Rodriguez struck out pinch-hitter Brant Brown with the bases
loaded.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Floyd returned to action for Florida after a three-game
absence with a nagging groin injury. ... Mueller saved a run in the
sixth, snaring Kevin Millar's line drive down the third-base line.
... The announced crowd of 9,072 was Florida's third-lowest at home
this season. The three smallest crowds have all been against the
Giants.

<HEADLINE> Ky. Train Fire Causes Evacuation  </HEADLINE>
By ANN GIBSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DANVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- An explosive and toxic chemical fire on a
railroad car forced evacuations Tuesday in this central Kentucky
city and disrupted traffic on a main rail line.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities moved the car, with the chemical still burning
inside, to a more remote site about 1\ miles south of the city. An
explosion occurred inside the car after it was moved, said Rodney
Raby, assistant state fire marshal. No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators had not determined what caused the chemical to
catch fire and send a plume of white smoke and gas into the
Danville sky. The fire, which was reported around 11:30 a.m., was
still burning Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The car was carrying 148,000 pounds of the chemical, sodium
dithionite, a flammable product that can produce irritating,
corrosive or toxic gases, said Patrick Conley, a spokesman for the
Kentucky Division of Emergency Management. The chemical, also known
as sodium hydrosulfate, is an irritant to people who breathe its
fumes, and it can cause injuries or death.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials and representatives of the chemical and
train companies met late Tuesday night to discuss their options.
Raby said the best option may be to allow the chemical to burn and
possibly enhance the burning. He said authorities could not douse
the chemical with enough water or flame retardant to stop the fire.
</P>
<P>
   The 94-car Norfolk Southern freight train was traveling from
Knoxville, Tenn., to Cincinnati when the fire was discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the approximately 1,000 evacuees were allowed back into
the homes and businesses when the car was moved out of the area,
but the unstable car meant rail traffic was shut down on the
north-south line.
</P>
<P>
   George Wilke, Norfolk-Southern division superintendent, said 50
to 60 trains use the main line through Danville each day and that
some of those are being routed through a line up the East Coast,
The Courier-Journal reported in Wednesday's paper.
</P>
<P>
   Danville is about 100 miles southeast of Louisville.

<HEADLINE> Hostages Said To Be in Philippines  </HEADLINE>
By PAT ROQUE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISABELA, Philippines (AP) -- A Philippine rebel commander is
suspected of kidnapping of 21 people at Malaysian diving resort and
is holding them on islands at the Philippines' southern tip,
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are here,'' Sulu provincial Governor Abdusakur Tan said,
adding that they are probably being held by Galid Andang, the
commander of Muslim Abu Sayyaf rebels in the province.
</P>
<P>
   Andang is also suspected of having masterminded the kidnappings
of three Hong Kong fishery workers in 1998 and a businessman freed
in January after being held for 70 days, according to the military.
</P>
<P>
   Tan told The Associated Press he would meet later Wednesday with
military officials, including Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado, to
discuss whether to negotiate for the hostages' release.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're now zeroing in on just one province,'' said Mercado,
refering to Sulu. The province is a sparsely populated,
impoverished collection of islands.
</P>
<P>
   The kidnapping ordeal began Sunday night. Visitors to Sipadan
Island, one of the world's top diving resorts, saw their vacations
disintegrate into terror when six armed assailants stormed the
white-sand beaches, abducting 21 people, including at least 10
foreign tourists. An American couple, James and Mary Murphy of
Rochester, N.Y., escaped by refusing to swim out to the kidnappers'
boat and then hiding in bushes.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages include at least 10 foreigners from Germany,
France, South Africa, Finland and Lebanon. They also included a
Filipino worker and nine Malaysians, authorities said. The
nationality of the 21st hostage was not known.
</P>
<P>
   A Philippine police intelligence report said Tuesday that the
hostages had been taken on two fishing boats to the Sulu province
islands, about one hour away from Sipadan. But Lt. Edgar Joseph
Andres, whose navy plane conducted a three-hour search of the
sparsely inhabited area, said he saw no signs of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Early Tuesday, the Abu Sayyaf -- the Muslim rebel group under
siege for holding 27 Filipinos hostage for five weeks -- claimed
responsibility. But later its spokesman, Abu Ahmad, said he was not
certain the group was involved.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't give you a right answer at this moment,'' he told a
radio station.
</P>
<P>
   A waitress who escaped the abduction added weight to the belief
that Muslim rebels were responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Jeneth Cagaanan, 27, said ''one of the pirates pointed a gun at
my neck'' and demanded her money and jewelry. She said she replied
to him in Tausug -- a language spoken in the southern Philippine
provinces of Tawi Tawi and Sulu -- and the assailants understood
her. But some of the gunmen spoke Malay, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cagaanan said one of the assailants wore a vest emblazoned with
the initials ''MNLF,'' an acronym for the Moro National Liberation
Front.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Philippines' largest Muslim rebel group, the MNLF
signed a peace accord in 1996. But some disgruntled members now
belong to other Muslim groups.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf are the smaller but more radical of two groups
fighting for an independent Islamic state in the predominantly
Roman Catholic Philippines. They have been blamed for numerous
attacks on Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Mamat Talib said five people were arrested and
interrogated in Sabah, a Malaysian state on northern Borneo, in
connection with the abductions. Police sources said some of those
arrested were former Sipadan resort employees. They were suspected
of knowing some of the gunmen or helping them.
</P>
<P>
   In the Philippines, meanwhile, troops pounded several Abu Sayyaf
camps with rockets Tuesday in an attempt to free the remaining
Filipino hostages, mostly schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the rebels announced that they had beheaded two of
their adult hostages. They have threatened to behead five more, if
the military does not halt the assault.
</P>
<P>
   The group has demanded freedom for three men jailed in the
United States, including Ramzi Yousef, mastermind of the 1993
bombing of the World Trade Center, and Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman,
accused of conspiring to blow up New York City landmarks.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals 7, Brewers 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire homered for the third straight
game and Darryl Kile won his fourth game as the St. Louis Cardinals
beat the Milwaukee Brewers 7-2 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who missed nine games this season with a sore back,
homered in the first, one out after a homer by Edgar Renteria off
Brewers starter Jason Bere (2-2).
</P>
<P>
   McGwire now has six homers among his 12 hits, and the Cardinals
have homered in 16 straight games. They extended their NL record
for home runs in the month of April to 47 when Ray Lankford hit a
three-run homer in the eighth, and they are just two short of
Cleveland's major league record set in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Kile (4-1) struck out a season-high 10 batters and gave up two
runs on six hits and one walk in seven innings. He was 8-13 last
season with Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee scored a run in the first on singles by Marquis
Grissom and Mark Loretta and a sacrifice fly by Jeromy Burnitz.
</P>
<P>
   Bere, who gave up four runs on six hits and four walks in six
innings, beat the Cardinals 9-1 on April 7.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers have lost eight of 11 games, while the Cardinals
have won six of 11.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Matheny put the Cards ahead 3-1 in the fourth with a
sacrifice fly after Bere walked the bases full. Kevin Barker closed
it to 3-2 with a home run for the Brewers in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Matheny drove in another run with a two-out single in the sixth
after a single by Lankford and a walk to Fernando Tatis.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals missed another opportunity to score when J.D. Drew
was out at the plate in the second when Kile missed on a bunt
attempt on a squeeze play.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Lankford has 24 strikeouts in 63 at-bats and is 3-for-20
with runners in scoring position. ... Tatis had his streak of
driving in at least one run in a game stopped at nine, one short of
the team record set by Bill White in 1961. ... The Cardinals are
13-0 when they do not commit an error and 0-7 when they make an
error. ... Geoff Jenkins is eight for his last 17 (.471) with three
home runs and seven RBIs. ... Burnitz is in a 4-for-25 (.160)
slump.

<P>
   AUBURN, Ala. (AP) -- Auburn tight end Lorenzo Diamond was in
serious but stable condition Tuesday night after undergoing surgery
for at least one gunshot wound to the abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Tommy Carswell of the Auburn police department said Diamond
arrived at Opelika's East Alabama Medical Center in an automobile
Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Carswell said late Tuesday that detectives had not had a chance
to interview Diamond and the circumstances of the shooting were
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   It was also unknown how many times Diamond was shot, Carswell
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Dr. Stephen Lock, who operated on Diamond, said
the sophomore from Biloxi, Miss., sustained intestinal wounds. Lock
said a full recovery is expected.
</P>
<P>
   Diamond caught 13 passes for 159 yards and scored one touchdown
last season for the Tigers.

<HEADLINE> Orioles 12, White Sox 6  </HEADLINE>
By RICK GANO, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Delino DeShields reached base five straight
times, and the Baltimore Orioles used a six-run third inning to
beat the Chicago White Sox 12-6 Tuesday night, ending their
six-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   DeShields had a double, two singles, two walks and three RBIs,
and Rich Amaral keyed the Orioles' big inning with a two-run
triple. Baltimore also benefited from 12 walks.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Rapp (3-0) stayed unbeaten, giving up eight hits and five
runs in five innings, including a three-run homer to Paul Konerko
in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago lefty Mike Sirotka (2-2), scratched from his previous
start because of soreness in his forearm, gave up eight runs, four
of them unearned, and lasted only 2 1-3 innings. He was hurt by
five walks, two errors and two bloop hits among the five he
surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   Sirotka walked Jeff Conine in the third, Cal Ripken hit a bloop
single and Charles Johnson followed with a single for a 4-2 lead.
Amaral then blooped a ball down the right-field line that got by a
charging Magglio Ordonez for a two-run triple.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Bordick followed with a liner to right that Ordonez
dropped, allowing Amaral to trot in with the seventh run, finishing
Sirotka. Brady Anderson then greeted reliever Scott Eyre with an
RBI double and DeShields delivered another run-producing hit and
the Orioles were rolling, 9-2.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken and Johnson walked to start the Orioles second, but after
Amaral hit into a double play, it looked like Sirotka would get out
of the jam. But third baseman Greg Norton muffed Bordick's bouncer
to third, allowing Ripken to score. Bordick stole second, Anderson
hit an RBI double and DeShields hit a run-scoring single for a
quick 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Singleton and Mark Johnson had RBI singles for Chicago in
the second. Konerko's fifth homer made it 9-5.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles tacked on two in the seventh on DeShields' RBI
double and an RBI single by B.J. Surhoff, who made it 12-6 with a
homer in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Orioles RHP Scott Erickson, on the DL with an elbow
problem, made his first rehab start for Class A Frederick on
Tuesday night. He threw 84 pitches in 6 2-3 innings, allowing two
runs and three hits, with one walk and five strikeouts, against
Potomac. ... Reliever Calvin Maduro was forced out in the sixth
inning after being hit on the right foot by a line drive off the
bat of Norton. He was replaced by Buddy Groom, who got Herbert
Perry to line back to the mound, starting a double play. ... The
Orioles had 12 hits.

   HERSHEY, Pa. (AP) -- The U.S. men's soccer team moved one victory
from an Olympic berth Tuesday night with a 0-0 tie against Canada
in the CONCACAF qualifying tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The United States will face Guatemala in the semifinals Friday
night, and the winner will qualify for the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   After the Americans routed Honduras 3-0, then Canada lost 2-0 to
Honduras, all the United States needed was a tie to win the group
and advance.
</P>
<P>
   ''We knew it would be a battle. We knew it wouldn't be a
particularly pretty game ,'' U.S. coach Clive Charles said. ''They
did everything they could to stop us from getting into any kind of
rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a strange situation, being that after one game, chances
are that we were in the semifinals. It wasn't like we had to win
the game or score a certain amount of goals. Obviously we wanted to
win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. goaltender Tim Howard, playing in place of Adin Brown, who
was out with a sore right knee, recorded two saves. Canada's Mike
Frank had three saves as the Americans outshot the Canadians 11-7.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's best scoring opportunity came at 57:20 when Dwayne
DeRosario beat U.S. defender Steve Cherundolo at the top of the
penalty box and booted a 12-footer, but the shot sailed high.
</P>
<P>
   The United States' Ben Olsen shot from close to the goal in 79th
minute, but Frank deflected it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We fought hard,'' said Canada defender Kevin McKenna. ''I
thought we played better than them, we battled harder than them.
And I think we wanted it more than them.
</P>
<P>
   ''But that's soccer and that's the way it goes. Sometimes the
breaks don't go your way.''
</P>
<P>
   Two players were ejected after an altercation at 45 minutes.
Canada's Steve Kindel pulled at American Brian Dunseth's shirt as
Dunseth lay on the ground after a fall, and Dunseth leaped angrily
to his feet and threw Kindel to the ground, resulting in the
ejection. Officials said Dunseth will miss Friday's game and may
face other penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ''I messed up,'' Dunseth said. ''I got a hold of him and just
made a mistake. I got goaded into it and did something immature and
stupid, and something I would never do normally, and just in the
heat of moment just lost it.''

<HEADLINE> Critics say bill doesn't do enough to clean power plants  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The state Senate passed a bill late
Tuesday night that would require the state's dirtiest power plants
to start cleaning up by 2002, but critics say it doesn't do enough
to cut down air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which passed 28-7, now heads to the House.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers blasted the bill because it does not set a date
for the plants to close down if they don't meet certain emission
reduction requirements. Instead, the bill allows power companies to
purchase emission ''credits'' from other state companies that have
good pollution records. That would give the polluters more time to
clean up.
</P>
<P>
   ''Trading credits is a way of paying a fine for polluting,''
said Sen. Mary Ann Handley, D-Manchester. ''We don't want polluters
to pay a fine -- we want them to clean up their acts.''
</P>
<P>
   The House last week passed a bill that would force power plants
in Bridgeport, New Haven, Norwalk, Middletown, Milford and
Montville to clean up or close down by 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Unhappy with a 2006 deadline, leading Senators said they would
push for another bill Tuesday that would force the plants meet a
2003 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed a measure to enact that deadline. But that
measure was gutted when the Senate voted 18-17 for an amendment
that allows the credit trading.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a more responsible bill that sets stricter standards,
and makes it easier for power companies to meet them,'' said Sen.
Melodie Peters, D-Waterford. Sen. Eileen Dailey, D-Westbrook, also
pushed for the credit trading provision.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and environmental advocates say limiting the number of
pollutants being spit into the air would cut childhood asthma and
other breathing problems in the communities surrounding the plants.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Caruso, the Bridgeport Democrat who has been
pushing for clean air legislation in the House, called Peters and
Dailey ''the pollution twins.''
</P>
<P>
   ''What they handed people tonight is continued air pollution,''
Caruso said. He accused them of pushing for legislation that
benefits the power companies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know how he can say that,'' Dailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Kirk, general manager of Wisvest-Connecticut, which owns
the Bridgeport and New Haven plants said the company could meet the
reduced emission requirements with the credit trading provision.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bill is stricter in terms of requirements for plants, and
it certainly a difficult bill for the industry,'' Kirk said. ''The
only bright spot is it restores some of tools we need to make
strict limitations work.''
</P>
<P>
   Wisvest last year paid United Illuminating $272 million for the
plants. The plants had to be auctioned off under an electric
deregulation law.
</P>
<P>
   NRG Energy Inc. paid Northeast Utilities $460 million for plants
in Norwalk, Middletown, Milford and Montville.

<HEADLINE> Astros 11, Cubs 7  </HEADLINE>

   HOUSTON (AP) -- Moises Alou went 4-for-4 and Richard Hidalgo had
three RBIs as the Houston Astros beat the Chicago Cubs 11-7 on
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Reynolds (4-0) allowed four runs and seven hits in six
innings as the Astros snapped a three-game skid.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Biggio's two-run single keyed a four-run sixth inning that
gave the Astros a 7-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Former Astro Ricky Gutierrez had three RBIs on a two-run homer
and a sacrifice fly, but struck out with the bases loaded to end
the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Downs (1-1) allowed six runs and nine hits in five-plus
innings. The Cubs have lost four straight, allowing 41 runs in that
span.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bagwell hit his seventh homer of the season for Houston, a
solo shot that tied the game at 2 in the third inning. Alou added
an RBI single in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs took a 4-3 lead in the fifth on Gutierrez's sacrifice
fly and Sammy Sosa's RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros then went ahead for good in the sixth. Tony Eusebio
had an RBI single, Biggio bounced a two-run, bases-loaded single
over third baseman Shane Andrews' head and Russ Johnson had a
run-scoring single.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago closed the margin in the seventh with Henry Rodriguez's
two-run homer to right, his fourth of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Houston added four runs in the eighth on an RBI single by Bill
Spiers, a two-run double by Hidalgo and a sacrifice fly by Alou.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs jumped on Reynolds early. Eric Young doubled off the
left-field wall to start the game and Gutierrez followed with his
third homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros answered in the bottom half when Biggio led off with
a single and moved to third on Bagwell's one-out double and scored
on Hidalgo's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Astros improved to 3-7 at home. ... The two teams
combined for three home runs. There have been 35 home runs hit in
10 games at new Enron Field. ... Biggio's single in the first
inning gave him a career high 15-game hitting streak. His previous
high of 14 was set in 1997. Biggio went 0-for-4 opening day this
season but has hit in every game he has played since ... The Astros
lead the league in hit by pitches with 15 and have been hit in six
of the last seven games. ... Downs got his first major league hit
with a single to right in the fourth inning ... The Cubs have
homered in each of the last nine games. Cubs are 6-11 in games in
which they have homered.
