CLINTON WATCHES AS PALESTINIANS VOTE TO RESCIND 1964 PROVISION 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip _ In a dramatic but symbolic gesture for
peace applauded by President Clinton, members of the Palestine
National Council raised their hands Monday to show support for
removing charter provisions calling for Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, cloaked in security in this desert city that has seen
so much violence, became the first U.S. president to visit
Palestinian territory as he championed peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   He convinced Palestinian Chairman Yasser Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to meet with him at a border
checkpoint Tuesday to try to revive a stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a remarkable day,'' Clinton said, thanking the
Palestinians for recommitting themselves to peace. ``I know that
the Palestinian people stand at a crossroads: behind you a history
of dispossession and dispersal; before you the opportunity to shape
a new Palestinian future on your own land.''
</P>
<P>
   But Netanyahu continued to signal that Israel will delay
withdrawing its troops from portions of the West Bank, a move
required by Friday under the 2-month-old Wye River Memorandum.
Although Netanyahu called the council's action Monday significant,
he made new demands of the Palestinians that he said must be met
before Israel agrees to cede more territory.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spent his second day in the Middle East trying to sort
through shifting signals and brash pronouncements by Arafat and
Netanyahu, who are trying to settle internal political disputes as
well as negotiate with each other.
</P>
<P>
   At the council meeting, Arafat spoke to the hundreds of
delegates ``from my heart to your hearts.'' He asked them for a
show of hands to remove the organization's 1964 charter provision
calling for Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
   They first raised their hands, then stood spontaneously, some
forming a ``V'' for victory with their fingers. Only a small
segment remained seated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that this will close this chapter forever, for we have
carried out our commitments and obligations. And we are determined
to continue our quest for peace .. and coexistence on the basis of
respecting justice and international legitimacy,'' Arafat said in
Arabic.
</P>
<P>
   Like Netanyahu the previous day, Arafat voiced his commitment to
the Wye River Memorandum and to peace with Israel. But he also
listed a series of moves by Israelis, from their refusal to release
political prisoners to their continuing to build Jewish
settlements, that he maintained violated the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Israel had demanded the symbolic vote despite forecasts that
Arafat might be unable to muster the required PNC support. The
Palestinian leader had declared in 1996 that the charter provisions
were nullified and restated that commitment in a letter in January
to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He agreed to seek a vote as part of the Wye River accord, which
also called for Israel to cede portions of the West Bank in return
for security guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, who on Monday accused the Palestinians of meeting
none of their Wye agreement obligations, offered conditional
support for the vote, saying it was but one step.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very important step. I welcome it. It is a positive
step. But you have to recognize that it is only the first step, and
further steps are needed,'' he said in Jerusalem. ``Words are
significant, but if they are opposed to deeds, then that's not
enough. There have to be acts as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu again demanded that Arafat renounce the Palestinians'
stated intention to declare an independent state next year with
Jerusalem as its capital. Israel will not proceed with the Wye
River plan unless there is such a renunciation, the prime minister
said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Arafat reiterated his call for a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   The United States maintains that statehood and Jerusalem are
issues to be discussed in final peace-status talks.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright confirmed that Israel
probably will not meet Friday's deadline for a second phase of
troop redeployment that would turn more West Bank land over to
Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   Key provisions in the Wye accord call for Israel to withdraw
from 13 percent of the West Bank land it controls. Israel made the
first withdrawal, a 2 percent pullback, and was scheduled to make
its second Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that there are indications that it will not happen on
schedule; but we hope very much that it can be as close to the
schedule as possible,'' Albright said. She said the redeployment
will be one the key topics when the three leaders meet today.
</P>
<P>
   They will convene at Erez, the main Israeli-Palestinian
checkpoint between the Gaza Strip and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The Wye River Memorandum has faltered in recent weeks. An
Israeli refusal to release political prisoners, for example,
prompted Palestinian youths to provoke violent clashes with Israeli
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, confronted by hard-liners opposed to the accord,
narrowly averted his government's collapse last week. He appears in
no hurry to implement peace provisions while the political
situation is turbulent.
</P>
<P>
   At the council meeting, Clinton spoke movingly of meeting
Palestinian children whose fathers are Israeli prisoners and of
meeting Israeli children whose fathers died in violent
confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to find a way for both sets of children to get their
lives back and to go forward,'' Clinton said. ``Palestinians must
recognize the right of Israel and its people to live safe and
secure lives today, tomorrow and forever. Israel must recognize the
right of Palestinians to aspire to live free today, tomorrow and
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's appearance was an enormous triumph for Arafat, whose
Palestine Liberation Organization the United States refused to
recognize until a decade ago because of its terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The president cut a red ribbon opening the new Gaza
International Airport that Palestinians hope will fuel economic
development in this impoverished area.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, dressed in his trademark kaffiyeh, greeted Clinton with
enthusiasm, hailing him as a peacemaker. The representatives of the
Palestinian organizations clapped loudly and rhythmically for
Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. Daughter Chelsea
also sat in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. flags were pinned to cinder block hovels and were carried
by school children.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous posters of Clinton and Arafat lined shop windows. Signs
read: ``Welcome to Palestine, Mr. President.''
</P>
<P>
   On the down side, security forces arrested scores of suspects
whom they feared might cause trouble.

THOUSANDS OF CHINESE IN SPONTANEOUS PILGRIMAGE TO MADAME CHIANG'S
ESTATE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LATTINGTOWN, N.Y. _ The auctioneer had planned a small open
house here for special clients who had expressed an interest in
buying some of the belongings of Madame Chiang Kai-shek.
</P>
<P>
   But word of the auction preview went out over the Internet on
Saturday and was published in newspapers in Taiwan and in Chinese
communities across the United States on Sunday, complete with
directions on how to make the 30-mile trip east from mid-Manhattan
to Hillcrest, her former estate here on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   By midday Sunday, tens of thousands of people of Chinese descent
converged on the narrow winding lanes of Lattingtown and the nearby
village of Locust Valley on the North Shore, hoping to catch a
glimpse of the 36-acre estate that was Madame Chiang's home for
more than 50 years. She is now 100 years old and lives in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Local authorities, including Lattingtown Mayor Clarence
Michalis, fire marshals and the Nassau County police became so
concerned that they ordered the estate closed at 11 a.m. on Sunday.
But the cars still kept coming, at one point backing up traffic for
more than six miles.
</P>
<P>
   The outpouring of Chinese families who arrived from as far away
as Boston and Virginia stunned the auctioneer, Gary Braswell,
president of Braswell Galleries in Norwalk, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frightening and sad all at the same time,'' he said.
``We had room to handle 150 cars, but they parked everywhere and
rushed to the house. Only when people got inside did they suddenly
become calm, almost reverential, like they were on a religious or
historic pilgrimage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The people really didn't come with the idea of buying
anything,'' said Braswell, who spent Sunday night in the house
along with the caretaker, out of concern that some people might try
to enter after dark. ``They just wanted to look and see where and
how Madame Chiang lived her life. They would sit on a couch or a
chair in her bedroom while other members of the family took
pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   Madame Chiang fled to the United States in 1949 from Taiwan
after forces led by her husband, Gen. Chiang Kai-shek, the former
Nationalist leader of China, were driven from the Chinese mainland
by the Communists.
</P>
<P>
   Braswell said that most of the valuable pieces of furniture and
paintings had already been removed from the house by Madame
Chiang's family and that there were few pieces of Chinese art or
furniture left.
</P>
<P>
   He said that while searching the house from basement to attic,
he nevertheless found a dozen pieces of value that he planned to
auction on Jan. 3 in Norwalk. He said the items would include
matching crystal chandeliers and some large oil paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Braswell said the rest of the household goods and furnishings,
including Madame Chiang's bedroom set and other items, would be
sold at a special auction in Norwalk on Jan. 24. And he hoped that
by Friday a catalog of the items would be available on an Internet
site still being set up (braswellgalleries.com).
</P>
<P>
   Irwin Stillman, president of the Stillman Organization, a
Manhattan construction company that bought Hillcrest and its
contents for $2.8 million, said he attended the open house early
Saturday ``when everything was calm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all overwhelmed by the turnout,'' he said. ``Never in
a million years did we expect anything like this. It's as if we're
showing a home that belonged to the Queen of England and everyone
came.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're builders and developers and that's what we intend to do
with the property,'' Stillman said. He bought the property in
August from descendants of Madame Chiang's sister, Soong Ailing.
</P>
<P>
   Among the people turned away at the entrance of Hillcrest Monday
morning was Charlie Tsai, a computer engineer who came with his
wife from Holmdel, N.J., after reading about the open house in a
Taiwan newspaper on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very disappointed,'' he said. ``This is a part of our
heritage and we are sorry that it is all being sold, piece by
piece. It all has meaning to Chinese people everywhere. It's as if
someone sold Mount Vernon and all of George Washington's things to
a developer. What would Americans think when all their history was
taken away from them?''

N . Y . 'S NEW ATTORNEY GENERAL: A CENTRIST WITH A PASSION FOR
IDEAS
</HEADLINE>
  (See also VACCO-CONCEDE, EDIT-NY-ATTY-GENERAL) 
 (nk) 
 By TERRY PRISTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To most New Yorkers, Eliot Spitzer, the state
attorney general-elect, is a largely unfamiliar figure, known, if
at all, more as the scion of a wealthy family than as a man driven
by serious ideas.
</P>
<P>
   But ask Spitzer about complicated issues like utility regulation
or milk pricing, and he can discourse at length, with a grasp of
detail that might well bring to mind that more famous policy wonk
in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Ideas _ and the question of how best to apply them _ have always
engaged and energized Spitzer, his friends say. As a student at
Harvard Law School in the early 1980s, for example, he teamed with
legal scholar Abram Chayes to publish an article about arms control
in space. A few years ago, to put some of his ideas into practice,
he helped to found a public-interest law firm with a centrist
ideology. It tries to serve as a counterpoise to groups like the
New York Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   Given the odds of beating an incumbent in a statewide race _ and
polls that consistently showed Spitzer, a Democrat, behind Attorney
General Dennis Vacco, a Republican _ even Spitzer's closest
advisers were surprised on election night when he seemed to be
inching toward victory. But people who have known Spitzer for many
years say he can always be counted on to achieve his goals, no
matter how far-fetched they may seem.
</P>
<P>
   There was, for example, the time he and two law school
classmates, all merely casual runners, decided on a whim to
participate in the New York City Marathon. The event was a scant
two months away, and none of them had begun to train for it. ``Very
quickly, two of the three of us fell by the wayside,'' recalled
Clifford Sloan, now a lawyer in Washington. ``But Eliot kept at it
and ran in the marathon.''
</P>
<P>
   While he was in law school, Spitzer got his first taste of the
attorney general's office as a summer intern. ``He was the best law
student I ever had,'' said his then-boss, Lloyd Constantine, who
headed the antitrust bureau for 11 years and is in charge of
Spitzer's transition team. ``He was very smart, very precocious,
and he clearly wanted to have a career in public service.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, when Constantine set his up his own law firm, Spitzer
became one of his partners.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Spitzer, a former assistant district attorney in
Manhattan, had already made one unsuccessful attempt to win the
Democratic nomination for attorney general. The only political
newcomer in the race, he finished last in a field of four
candidates after spending more than $4 million of his own money on
his campaign. Many New York City lawyers wrote him off as a child
of privilege _ his father, Bernard, is a successful real estate
developer _ who was trying to buy his way into state office. The
younger Spitzer is also a product of the Riverdale Country Day
School, Horace Mann School and Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   Many lawyers were also turned off by his support of the death
penalty, a position that puts him at odds with his wife, Silda
Wall, a lawyer who belongs to New York Lawyers Against the Death
Penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Some were also unhappy with his campaign pledge to strengthen
the crime-fighting role of the attorney general's office. Under
Robert Abrams, who served as the state's top lawyer from 1979
through 1993, the office had gained prestige for its efforts in
enforcing environmental, civil rights and consumer laws.
</P>
<P>
   To blunt some of the criticism, Spitzer spent much of 1996 and
1997 traveling around the state in a van, getting to know the
state's political infrastructure and making friends. If a speaker
at a political dinner canceled at the last moment, Spitzer was
always ready to serve as a stand-in, said John Marino, a strategist
for Spitzer.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer probably made even more friends by contributing
generously to other campaigns around the state, doling out $50,000,
for example, to the local party machine in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   But in influential legal circles, his negatives still dogged
him. He was considered the weakest of the four candidates running
in this year's Democratic primary election for attorney general.
About 100 lawyers who had worked for Abrams supported one of
Spitzer's opponents, state Sen. Catherine Abate. Many Democrats saw
him as too much of a centrist and gave him only grudging support in
the general election.
</P>
<P>
   He alienated some liberals in May 1995 when he helped set up a
branch of a nonprofit, nonpartisan group now known as the Center
for the Community Interest. ``In a nutshell,'' said Dennis Saffran,
the center's regional director, ``we are the common-sense counter
to the ACLU on crime and quality-of-life issues, without going to
the other extreme.''
</P>
<P>
   The center has defended the state law allowing the police to
publicize the whereabouts of released sex offenders and the New
York City ordinance banning strip clubs and shops that sell
sexually explicit material from residential neighborhoods. The
group also helped promote legislation to require hospitals to
notify mothers and doctors when newborn babies test positive for
HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the organization's positions have led critics like
Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties
Union, to conclude that Spitzer, like his predecessor, will seek
``to transform the attorney general's office into a super state
district attorney's office, with a focus on criminal law
enforcement, rather than protecting civil rights.''
</P>
<P>
   While Spitzer has drawn criticism from the New York City bar
association's more liberal faction, he has impressed other lawyers
with his pragmatic approach to criminal justice and other urban
issues.
</P>
<P>
   His supporters say that Spitzer's rejection of many traditional
liberal values stems from deeply held beliefs, not just the desire
to win public office. ``This guy is a passionate centrist,'' said
Ryan Karben, who managed Spitzer's campaign in Rockland County.
``He hugs the center, not only out of political expediency. It's an
intellectual imperative for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer's most serious misstep during the campaign was his lack
of candor about how much help he had received from his father, who
lent him millions of dollars to repay the bank loans for his 1994
campaign. ``He thought it was a very personal thing,'' said Marino,
who, like the other advisers to the campaign, thought Spitzer
should have addressed the issue earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In the final weeks, the attorney general's race was conducted
mainly through television advertising and faxed press releases. On
the campaign trail _ what there was of it _ Spitzer's inexperience
showed, and he often seemed ill at ease. Instead of kissing a
baby's cheek, he was more inclined to hand the infant a campaign
flier.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet, who was Spitzer's boss in
the mid-1980s, said his former clerk has the right stuff for an
attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is really required,'' Sweet said, ``is a grasp of the
issues, a definition of the concept of the office, an understanding
of what the office can accomplish, and some sense of vision. I
think he has all those things.''

SOME LAWMAKERS RAISING NEW OBJECTIONS TO TERMS OF NFL DEAL 
</HEADLINE>

 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Legislative leaders' hopes for trouble-free
passage of a stadium deal with the New England Patriots were set
back today when several Democrats said they would fight for the
state to retain the right to sell the stadium's name, which could
be worth tens of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut General Assembly will hold a special session on
Tuesday to consider a tentative agreement between Gov. John Rowland
and the Patriots to move the team from the Boston area to a new
stadium in downtown Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, the state would build the $375 million
stadium, and the Patriots would use it rent free for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland and legislative leaders had predicted swift approval
after owner Robert Kraft agreed on Sunday to reduce the state's
potential financial liability if the National Football League team
is unable to sell all of the stadium's luxury seats and boxes.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday, several Democrats in the House of Representatives
lobbied colleagues to build support for an amendment to strip the
Patriots of the naming rights, which were among the many sweeteners
in the deal that led stadium economists to say that Connecticut had
handed Kraft one of the most lucrative deals in American sports.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Alex Knopp, D-Norwalk, called the naming rights ``another
unfortunate example of the lack of balance in the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The state bears all the risk and the owner reaps all the
profits,'' Knopp said. ``There is still a lot of unsettledness
among legislators about the lack of investigation and public
participation in the details of the agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Moira Lyons, D-Stamford, warned that the
deal was set and that any further tinkering ``obviously puts a
question mark on the ability to bring the Patriots here.''
</P>
<P>
   While any further changes to the deal would allow the Patriots
to walk away with no penalty, Jonathan Kraft, a son of the owner
who is the team's chief negotiator, said he would continue to
consider legislators' concerns even as the bill was debated on
Tuesday.

SPIKE LEE MOVING; MAILER STUDYING  

</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Spike Lee made Brooklyn the backdrop for such films
as ``Do the Right Thing'' and ``Jungle Fever,'' and his production
company has a Brooklyn telephone number. But Lee is getting a new
home number. He is leaving his old Brooklyn neighborhood for a $7
million town house on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, brokers
familiar with the deal say.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's old house, a five-story town house in Fort Greene, has
been on the market for several weeks. The broker who listed the
21-foot-wide Victorian house refused to comment, but has been
circulating a color brochure that describes the towel warmers in
the bathroom and the ground floor garden. Other brokers said the
price was in the $900,000 range.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was in his new neighborhood Monday. ``I go to the gym around
the corner,'' said another real estate person familiar with the
deal, ``and he was working out next to me, trying to be incognito
with a baby blue ski cap.''
</P>
<P>
   Mailer vs. Goethe?
</P>
<P>
   Norman Mailer is many things: a literary icon; a Brooklyn-born
braggart who has feuded famously with other well-known writers; the
septuagenarian author of mind-bogglingly complicated best sellers
that many critics consider operatic-quality songs of himself.
</P>
<P>
   In English.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, he is studying German at Berlitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still that fire in his eyes,'' said Jeff Lackey, an
instructor who encountered Mailer at Berlitz, on West 51st Street
near Fifth Avenue. ``He has that take-no-prisoners,
I'll-tear-your-heart-out attitude projecting from his eyes.''
Lackey said the word was that Mailer wanted to read Goethe the way
Goethe wrote it. No translations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He speaks three languages badly: Spanish, French and German,''
said his assistant, Judith McNally. ``Every three years he tries to
freshen up one of the three. This year it's German's turn.''
</P>
<P>
   A Third Helping &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tina Brown, who left The New Yorker for a magazine venture with
Miramax, saw the Miramax film ``Shakespeare in Love'' on Saturday
night. This was not one of those premieres that celebrities are
always going to, but the 9:50 at Cinema I on Third Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``My third time,'' she said. She took her husband, Harry Evans,
who had been away for the premiere, and said she liked it so much
she might go back for a fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Did he like it? She handed the telephone to him. He called it
``funny, witty and droll'' and was saying something about ``a
razzle-dazzle romp'' when she took the telephone back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't talk too long,'' she said. ``This is a reporter you're
talking to.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrap Him Up &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Morgenstern wondered what the crowd outside at Barneys was
staring at Monday. ``My mom pulled me to the third one,'' she said,
referring to one of the fastidiously decorated windows. ``She was
clutching hard. Normally she does that when she sees a famous
person. I was looking toward the left and he was towards the
right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He'' was her boyfriend, Bill Webber, sitting in the window and
holding a sign asked her to marry him.
</P>
<P>
   Webber had asked Barneys to let him propose this way because he
and Ms. Morgenstern are fans of the window designer Simon Doonan,
who, among other things, made a Christmas tree of Tic-Tac mints.
The store helped Webber, a 27-year-old financial analyst, with his
hair and makeup. But his clothing was his own, a Barneys spokesman
said, ``and he fit right in.''
</P>
<P>
   After she finally noticed him, they kissed through the plate
glass.

TV SPORTS: SEIFERT NUDGED ASIDE, BUT WILL HE BE ALONE? 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the news reported Sunday on CBS's ``The NFL Today,'' Jim
Nantz reported nothing of the network's benching of George Seifert
from the studio program.
</P>
<P>
   The former San Francisco 49ers coach is on hiatus, like a sitcom
in trouble, until the playoffs. His pine vacation is CBS's first
admission that at least one of its three neophyte analysts _
Seifert, Brent Jones and Marcus Allen _ has performed well below
expectations. But they all have. Their inexperience has forced
Nantz to control the program too much rather than rely on strong
partners, an advantage enjoyed by ESPN's Chris Berman and Fox's
James Brown.
</P>
<P>
   For a network to tell one of its studio stars to stay home
during the crucial last weeks of the regular season is
extraordinary. But telling Seifert not to come to work says more
about his role in the show than about rumors that he will leave to
coach Seattle or Cleveland. After all, CBS held on to Lou Holtz as
a college football studio analyst _ and even had him analyze a
National Football League game on Dec. 6 _ until the moment he left
to coach the University of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unusual, but everybody's goal is to work to put on the
best show there is,'' said Leslie-Anne Wade, a spokeswoman for CBS
Sports.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, hiring Seifert, Jones and Allen was
questionable, especially with the availability of Craig James, the
network's college football studio analyst, as well as Cris
Collinsworth, Randy Cross and Paul Maguire. Collinsworth went to
Fox, Cross became CBS's No. 2 game analyst, and Maguire moved to
ESPN. Creating a show with untried analysts made no sense if proven
spark plugs were available.
</P>
<P>
   What has gone wrong? Seifert's reserved demeanor, no secret to
even a casual fan, does not fit into an atmosphere in which
extroversion thrives. Seifert's ability to offer a coach's
perspective _ which Wade said would be used during the playoffs _
has been drowned out in the competition for time, and attempts to
play to his strength on a regular basis were not plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   Jones has brought an obnoxious, disingenuous type of banter to
the show, and his craving for the last word makes him look greedy.
(And can he stop smiling?) Allen's penchant for stumbling over his
words indicates a failure to find a comfortable way to express
himself. Also, viewers get little sense that Allen and Jones are
obsessively telephoning league and team contacts for news.
</P>
<P>
   Seifert's benching led CBS to bring James on in relief; James is
a seasoned pro with a definite presence who elevated ``The NFL
Today.''
</P>
<P>
   If CBS viewed Seifert as dispensable _ and is admitting the show
is an evolution-in-progress _ will Jones or Allen be next to take a
forced leave?
</P>
<P>
   Fox's Antics
</P>
<P>
   Heading into its final season of carrying National Hockey League
games, Fox Sports seems bent on irking the league. Fox has produced
a series of promotional spots that extol fighting _ an image the
NHL has tried to flee _ instead of using the sort of edgy, usually
humorous sketches it used in 1994-95.
</P>
<P>
   In one, a montage of glorious shots is accompanied by an
announcer saying: ``Maybe it's the pageantry of this glorious game
that's born on the frozen ponds of youth. Maybe it's the great ones
who amaze us forever, providing those golden moments that will be
permanently etched in our minds and on the Stanley Cup.'' The
imagery then shifts to fighting, with the words, ``Maybe it's two
guys beating the bleep out of each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Solomon, the league's chief operating officer, said, ``I
think it's not the right message, or the appropriate message for
promoting the NHL.'' He said he has unsuccessfully complained to
David Hill, president of Fox Sports.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon does not know why Fox has taken this tack, and he
refused to speculate whether it was anger over the negotiations
that led to ABC's snaring the league's network deal from Fox
starting next season, or Fox's disappointing NHL ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Said Vince Wladika, a Fox spokesman: ``We've promoted hockey for
four years in many ways, but they didn't boost ratings. So we
thought, `Let's go back to the basic instinct and see if it
works.''' The spots will start running regularly during Fox's
broadcasts of the NFL playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   There are no fights in the ad campaign for Keith Olbermann's
Jan. 5 start as the star anchorman for cable's Fox Sports News. In
one spot, he parodies Charles Barkley's Nike commercial claim that
he is not a role model. ``Just because I say, `From way downtown _
bang!' that does not mean I should raise your kids.''
</P>
<P>
   In another, he says that during his news stint at MSNBC, he
missed coining ``absolutely meaningless catch phrases'' and racing
through obscure sports names like Zenon Andrushyshyn and Vitaly
Potapenko.

POLICE REPORT DETAILS NIGHTMARE AT ABORTION CLINIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JODIE SNYDER AND SUSIE STECKNER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ A doctor too busy eating his lunch to check on a
patient who was bleeding heavily. Staff members so inexperienced
that they didn't know where the pens were. An administrator who
asked for medical help 20 minutes away rather than from the
hospital across the street.
</P>
<P>
   And when it was clear the patient was in serious trouble, the
doctor's phoned-in advice: ``Well what do you want me to do? Call
911.''
</P>
<P>
   A Phoenix police investigation report, obtained by ``The Arizona
Republic,'' painted a picture of medical chaos on the day
33-year-old Lou Anne Herron died after going to the A-Z Women's
Center for an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republic'' also obtained copies of a police investigation
into a full-term fetus who was nearly aborted at the clinic two
months after Herron's death.
</P>
<P>
   The Maricopa County Attorney's office is looking at the reports
to decide whether to charge Dr. John Biskind, 72 _ the doctor who
performed Herron's abortion April 17 and delivered the unidenti
fied baby _ and Carol Stuart, 61, the clinic administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Biskind and his lawyer could not be reached for comment. Stuart
and her attorney declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   The police investigation included interviews with patients,
clinic workers and former employees. It found:
</P>
<P>
   _Staff members did not believe their own blood pressure
measuring instruments because Herron's readings were so low.
</P>
<P>
   _Herron asked for pain medication but staff couldn't give her
any because she was supposed to bring it herself.
</P>
<P>
   _Clinic records showed Herron had relatively low to normal blood
pressure readings minutes after employees called 911. Dr. Patricia
Graham, a medical reviewer working with the police, believed the
records were faked.
</P>
<P>
   What happened at A-Z to Herron was ``so far below acceptable
levels, it was scraping rock bottom,'' Graham said. Herron ``would
have survived with a minimal amount of care and treatment from Dr.
Biskind,'' Graham told investigators. Graham is director of
ambulatory services and perinatal addiction clinic at Maricopa
Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Biskind in August gave up his Arizona medical license, avoiding
a BOMEX probe into Herron's death. In September, he surrendered his
medical license in his home state of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Herron arrived at A-Z, 1002 E. McDowell Road, at 8 a.m. April
17. She had been told to get there early and wait her turn.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't her first visit. On April 9, she went to A-Z looking
for an abortion. A test showed that the baby was 26 weeks along.
Herron was distraught because the clinic would not do abortions
past 24 weeks, Sylvia Aragon, a clinic employee, told police.
</P>
<P>
   Herron went back for another sonogram _ maybe one that would
show she wasn't past the legal limit. Another test was performed at
the Family Planning Institute, A-Z's sister clinic in Glendale.
That sonogram, employee Tammy Lomas told police, showed her at 24
weeks and four days _ still four days past the legal limit. Lomas
told police that she told clinic administrators that Herron was too
far along. Lomas said she never thought Herron would come back to
A-Z.
</P>
<P>
   But Herron went back a third time and got at least three more
sonograms. Michelle Price, an employee who took the sonograms, said
she believed the most accurate reading was 24 weeks and two days.
</P>
<P>
   She also knew that Biskind wanted the sonogram to come within
legal limits.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle told police that Biskind had told her ``when you do an
ultrasound you can turn the probe at different angles and get
different results.''
</P>
<P>
   Many employees recalled the flap over Herron's series of
sonograms but few remembered the woman who came in for the
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Mabel Lopez, who had worked at the clinic for seven years,
remembered Herron as a ``nice girl'' _ one of maybe as many as 20 a
day who went into A-Z for abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Aragon told police that she asked Biskind why he was performing
an abortion on a woman so far along in her pregnancy. Biskind and
Stuart told Lopez that it was none of her business, she told
police.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Herron returned to A-Z. The night before, she had
called a friend, Barbara Blanc, for a ride to and from the clinic.
Even though she had known Blanc for 15 years, she hadn't told her
that she was pregnant. She didn't want anyone to know, Blanc told
police.
</P>
<P>
   Herron had already paid $1,250 to A-Z, either in cash or by
credit card. She was the first person in the clinic that day.
</P>
<P>
   While Herron was waiting for the procedure to start, Stuart was
telling personnel that they were going to be short-staffed.
</P>
<P>
   Employees said they knew that Lois Morengo, the clinic's
registered nurse, had told Stuart weeks in advance she was only
working a half day.
</P>
<P>
   According to A-Z's operating records, Herron went into surgery
around 12:30 p.m. Her abortion took longer than normal, about 45
minutes, employees told police.
</P>
<P>
   Herron was taken to the recovery room where Theresa Jimenez, who
had been working at A-Z for a week and half, was stationed. A-Z was
Jimenez's first job as a medical assistant. She had been hired to
answer phones and draw blood, not to work in the recovery room,
where usually a registered nurse watched over patients. Jimenez
told police she didn't even know where the recovery room's records
or pens were kept.
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez told police it was obvi ous from the start that Herron
was having problems. Georgina Obeso, another medical assistant who
had worked at A-Z for a month, said Herron was bleeding so heavily
that the blood was down to her knees.
</P>
<P>
   The more senior clinic employees saw how heavily Herron was
bleeding and went to tell Biskind. Lopez said he got mad that she
interrupted his lunch. ``Go talk to Carol,'' Biskind told Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Biskind went in to check on Herron, Jimenez said. He got
an intravenous tube started and told his patient there was nothing
to worry about, Jimenez said. Biskind told the staff to clean up
the bloody sheets and put down fresh bedding so they could tell if
she was bleeding any more, medical assistant Michelle Price said.
</P>
<P>
   Also during this time, Stuart called the Family Planning
Institute in Scottsdale, a sister clinic, asking an employee from
there to drive to A-Z to help out because they were having
problems. Two Scottsdale employees said Stuart's call came around 2
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The police timed how long it took to get from the Scottsdale
clinic to A-Z: 20 minutes and that was with one red light,
according to the police report.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, Herron's friend Blanc had returned to the
clinic. While in the waiting room, she could hear Herron saying
``Help me, my legs are numb.'' She then heard someone tell Herron,
``There's nothing wrong with you. The bleeding has stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez told police she remembered talking with Blanc, telling
her that everything with her friend was fine. Jimenez told police
she wished she would have told Blanc ``Something is wrong, and you
should get &UR; her out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   Employees remember clustering around Herron as she grew more
pale. Jenil Begay, a three-year clinic employee who performed
ultrasounds, said they could barely hear a heartbeat and told
Stuart to call 911.
</P>
<P>
   Both she and Deryl Whitlock, the employee who drove in from
Scottsdale, again told Stuart to call 911. Stuart looked at them
like they were ``looney,'' Begay told police.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart wanted to call Biskind. No employee was sure when Biskind
left the clinic. Pager records subpoenaed by the police show that
he was paged by A-Z at 4:12 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   When he called in, Price told him that they couldn't find a
pulse and Herron's breathing was really slow. ``Well what do you
want me to do? Call 911,'' Biskind told her.
</P>
<P>
   Aragon made the 911 call at 4:17 p.m. According to the 911 tape
obtained by police, employees also asked ``Can we have you come to
the side door, right on 10th Street and try not to use the
sirens.''
</P>
<P>
   When paramedics arrived at A-Z, Herron was on a gurney and the
sheets underneath her were soaked with blood, said Capt. Arnie
Barajas of the Phoenix Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   Herron appeared completely pale, cold and dead, he told police.
She had probably been dead for a while, Barajas said.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Stuart contacted employees and told them not to
talk about Herron's death. Stuart told them they had done the best
they could.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks after Herron's death, at least three employees
resigned. At least two employees, including Whitlock, wrote
detailed notes _ obtained by police _ about the botched abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Whitlock, the Scottsdale medical assistant called in for help,
cried to her sister about the death, her sister said. A co-worker
said Whitlock told her she was having trouble sleeping at night and
dreamed about Herron.
</P>
<P>
   ``She cried a lot over that,'' said her sister, who asked to
remain anonymous. ``Not because she didn't do her job, but because
there was nothing she could do to save her when she got there. She
(Herron) was already dying.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitlock died in a May 3 traffic accident near Loop 303 and
Olive Avenue. She had a blood-alcohol level of about 0.23 percent,
according to an autopsy report. Her notes from the abortion were
found on the floorboard of her car and turned over to police. When
the family buried Whitlock, they also buried a set of notes with
her.
</P>
<P>
   About two months after Herron's death, the A-Z clinic was rocked
again _ this time by a botched abortion on a 17-year-old patient.
</P>
<P>
   Biskind was performing an abortion on a Cottonwood girl June 30
and had a test that showed the teen to have been pregnant for about
23.6 weeks. But the girl was actually 37 weeks along and ended up
giving birth to a baby girl.
</P>
<P>
   The test _ one of six ultrasounds performed by an employee
trained on the job _ was conducted with a broken machine, the
employee told police. Obeso, the medical assistant, took separate
ultrasound photos of the teen, Stuart picked out the best one and
Obeso then discarded the rest, Obeso said. The police report does
not indicate the condition of the machine.
</P>
<P>
   The baby girl was adopted immediately and taken to Texas, where
she remains, Phoenix police Detective Mike McCullough said. She is
evaluated regularly, but does not appear to have any lasting
injuries from the near-abortion, he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to police, the Cottonwood teen had broken up with a
boyfriend in February and was pregnant. She and her mother decided
she would have an abortion and picked out A-Z from a phone book ad.
</P>
<P>
   They traveled to the Phoenix clinic, with $1,250 cash in hand,
and told Stuart that the teen was probably just over four months
pregnant. But some staff members at the clinic weren't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   The teen was large and looked much further along, Obeso told the
girl, and later, the police. But Millie Davis, a registered nurse
at the clinic that day, later told police that the teen didn't
appear to be full term, either.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the abortion, the teen was first on the schedule
and her mother was told the procedure would take 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   An hour passed. The mother, in a waiting room, worried about her
daughter. But staff members assured her the teen was all right, and
``it was just taking longer than expected,'' she said. She wanted
to see her daughter, but was told to be patient.
</P>
<P>
   Then, she told police she began to hear her daughter crying
loudly from a back room. Again, she asked to see her but was told
no.
</P>
<P>
   According to accounts by clinic staff, the teen was placed in a
recovery room and Biskind went back and forth between the recovery
room and operating room. He performed at least one abortion in the
meantime, if not more.
</P>
<P>
   The teen continued to cry out, so loudly Stuart at one point
told her to stop because she was scaring the other patients,
medical assistant Marianna Pierce told police.
</P>
<P>
   The contractions were coming and, Pierce thought, the baby would
follow any minute. Why, she asked Davis, was the teenager still at
the clinic instead of a hospital?
</P>
<P>
   Biskind assured them that when the teenager was ready to give
birth, he would deliver the baby.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime later, the teenager gave birth. Pierce and other
employees said they wanted to call 911, but were told not to by
Biskind. He reportedly said he didn't want any ``hysteria'' at the
clinic and didn't want to ``make a scene.''
</P>
<P>
   The baby, wrapped in a sheet with injuries to her head _ a skull
fracture and several lacerations _ was taken by employees across
the street to Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   The police report said the baby was full term. &QL;

people dreamed of doing great things that would not soon be
forgotten. Much of what they did has withstood the tides of time,

than twice the number of people who were sent back in the two years

possible because for the first time the INS has both the

criminal convictions as well as would-be immigrants at the border
and swiftly deport them from the United States _ sometimes in less

occasion of Pollock's retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art,
Namuth's camera is there again. Namuth himself died eight years
ago. But his photographs and films are being used to strip away the
layers of paint and lore that have covered Pollock since the 1950s.
Of course, the stripping is tricky, because Pollock's tortured
relationship with Namuth is itself part of the myth. A critic's

KEARIN TO JOIN UNLV STAFF
</HEADLINE>

By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ During the annual coaching-staff turnover, Jeff
Kearin held Cal State Northridge's football program together.
</P>
<P>
   It looks as though head coach Ron Ponciano will give the
Matadors stability through this offseason, but Kearin is moving on.
</P>
<P>
   Kearin, an assistant head coach and coach of special teams and
quarterbacks, is leaving CSUN to rejoin former head coach John
Robinson at UNLV.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great opportunity to work for someone the caliber of
John Robinson,'' Ponciano said. ``(Kearin has) been our stabilizing
force. He's been the constant through three different coaches. He's
brought a sense of continuity.''
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano also said he expected linebackers coach Kevin Singleton
to accept a position with a shoe company and leave CSUN. Singleton
was in his second season with the Matadors.
</P>
<P>
   Kearin couldn't be reached for comment because he was in transit
from Los Angeles to Las Vegas on Monday. He's expected to be named
UNLV's tight-ends coach and special-teams coach this week.
</P>
<P>
   Kearin spent the last four seasons at CSUN, the longest stint of
any coach. He began his service under Dave Baldwin, which lasted
two years, and worked for Jim Fenwick one season. Kearin was a
finalist for the head-coaching position when Ponciano was hired.
</P>
<P>
   Kearin, who coached with Robinson at USC for four seasons, was
instrumental in the staff transitions during the changes at CSUN.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been the glue between football and academics, football
and compliance,'' Ponciano said. ``When you lose someone of Jeff's
caliber, it's tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Kearin also served as CSUN's recruiting coordinator. Ponciano
said offensive line coach Aron Gideon might take over that role. He
added that he might elevate defensive-line coach Terrance Johnson
to full-time status. During the season Ponciano occasionally lauded
the job Johnson did.
</P>
<P>
   __ Season-ending awards: CSUN held its season-ending banquet
Sunday, with most categories broken into defense and offense. The
award winners:
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Marcus Brady was named the offensive Most Valuable
Player, rush end Brennen Swanson was the defensive MVP and kicker
Manny Marquez grabbed the special-teams award; Newcomers of the
Year were running back Jaumal Bradley and cornerback Chazz Moore;
the Coach's Award went to offensive lineman David San Vicente and
linebacker Shayne Blakey; Most Improved were wide receiver Jimmy
Greninger and Blakey; Most Inspirational were Bradley and defensive
lineman Sean Beard; Iron Man awards were given to wide receiver
Eric Carpenter and safety Vito Clemente, and the Black Shirt award
for scout-team duty went to running back Alan Taylor and defensive
back Isaac Gardner.
</P>
<P>
   Also, cornerback Donnell Day won the Sefton Award as the player
who excelled in both athletics and academics; tight end Ryan Schatz
won the ``Big Team, Little Me'' award and was CSUN's
scholar-athlete award winner, wide receiver Drew Hill was voted the
Triple-A winner for achievements in academics, athletics and
attitude, and Levi Line was selected Defensive Lineman of the Year.

MAYOR'S TAX PROPOSAL SEEKS TO KEEP L.A. COMPETITIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDITORS: Today in 6th graf refers to Tuesday.) 
BY RICK ORLOV  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Five years after his campaign to make the city
more business-friendly, Mayor Richard Riordan has released his
long-awaited proposal to reduce and simplify the city's tax
structure to make it more competitive.
</P>
<P>
   The far-reaching proposal calls for reducing the number of tax
categories from 64 to 10 and cuts overall business taxes by $23
million a year _ an 8 percent reduction he hopes will be made up by
getting thousands of noncomplying small businesses to pay city
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The reform package exempts enterprises generating less than
$5,000 in gross receipts from the city business tax, gives new
businesses a one-year exemption and seeks to make better use of
state programs to divert more money to the city.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan, in a meeting Monday with Daily News editors and
reporters, said the proposal is another step in his efforts to send
a message to the business community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are saying to businesses, we love you, we want you and we
want to make the city business-friendly,'' Riordan said. ``We think
this goes a long way to address the concerns we have had from
businesses and a way we can keep them here and attract new ones.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposals _ which will be publicly announced today _ must be
approved by the City Council and the voters to take effect. Riordan
said he wants the plan to go on the June 1999 ballot along with a
charter reform proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want it to be the year of reform,'' said Deputy Mayor
Noelia Rodriguez. ``Charter reform, tax reform and, hopefully,
school reform.''
</P>
<P>
   The tax proposals were developed over the course of the past two
years by a task force headed by Riordan, Councilman Richard
Alatorre as chairman of the City Council's Budget and Finance
Committee and a team of city officials. It contracted with Arthur
Anderson Co., the Milken Institute and others to analyze the city's
tax system.
</P>
<P>
   Those findings showed Los Angeles business taxes are higher and
more complicated than those in other cities. Business taxes provide
a higher percentage of city revenues _ 10 percent _ than in other
jurisdictions, accounting for $290 million of the city's general
fund.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of this is in lost businesses based in Los Angeles,
city officials said. One of the studies found that 66 percent of
those businesses leaving the city moved to another location within
Los Angeles County.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan said one of the goals of the tax reform effort is to
spur growth among new businesses, achieve greater compliance with
the city business taxes and make a more common-sense tax system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already been talking with some businesses in neighboring
cities who are interested in moving here,'' Riordan said. ``If this
is approved, it will make us competitive with (neighboring) Culver
City, Beverly Hills and Santa Monica. We won't be lower than
Glendale or Burbank, but they charge their residents more than we
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Under his plan, the filings for business permits would be phased
over to a fiscal year basis to help companies better coordinate
their payments rather than requiring them to be on a calendar year.
It also would help the city phase in a new approach.
</P>
<P>
   All businesses would have to take out a $20 permit, but firms
making under $5,000 a year would pay no city tax and start-ups
would have a one-year exemption from the business tax.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor also wants to start an educational program for
businesses that pay a use tax to the state, to have them direct the
money back to the city. The study estimated it could bring in $29
million a year to the city.
</P>
<P>
   Under this program, firms that buy goods from out of state are
required to pay the equivalent of the sales tax. However, unless
they specify the money to go the city, it goes to the county
government. In turn, the county gives one-third of the money to the
cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that alone amounts to $29 million a year,'' Riordan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Riordan wants to have a one-year program, called Amnesty
2000, to allow firms to pay back taxes without penalty. The mayor
said he believes the program would generate a first-year windfall
of $30 million and $10 million a year after that.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the report projects that businesses will save a total
of $23 million a year in reduced taxes. That would be covered with
the additional taxes from the use taxes, greater compliance and
efficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, the report said, the revenue would come from the
success of new businesses and attracting other businesses to the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan's major proposal is reducing the number of tax
categories to 10 for businesses and cutting the tax rate from a
high of $5.91 per $1,000 in gross receipts to $5.40 per $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, the lowest rate would be $1.20 per $1,000 in
gross receipts. It would apply to such industries as agriculture,
fishing, mining, oil drilling, furniture, greeting cards,
telephones, advertising, computer programming, schools and
education services.
</P>
<P>
   The second category of $1.40 per $1,000 would include building
contractors, apparel products, newspapers and publications, metal
industries, auto dealers, food stores and transportation equipment,
among others.
</P>
<P>
   In the $1.60 per $1,000 category would be media broadcasting
services, general merchandise stores, garden supply, building
material, auto supplies, home supplies, restaurants, hotels and
motels.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   In the $2.50 per $1,000 category, businesses covered include
trucking and warehousing, car rental, motion picture production and
distribution services, dance studios and commercial sports.
</P>
<P>
   In the $3.10 per $1,000 category, transportation firms such as
taxis, bus charters and air transport firms would be included as
well as direct-mail advertising, real estate subdividers and repair
shops.
</P>
<P>
   The $4.35 per $1,000 category includes tobacco products,
trucking services, data processing, computer facilities management,
nursing homes, hospitals and amusement facilities.
</P>
<P>
   In the $5.20 per $1,000 category are veterinary services, real
estate agents, beauty shops and court reporting.
</P>
<P>
   The highest category of $5.40 per $1,000 would include oil
pipelines, gun sellers, security brokers, insurance agents, medical
services and accounting.
</P>
<P>
   Another major change is in the mayor's proposal to modify how
the film industry is taxed.
</P>
<P>
   Presently, it pays a maximum of $12,700 for a film depending on
its cost.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new proposal, companies that produce films costing
$50,000 or less would pay $133 and those with productions under
$100,000 would pay $266.
</P>
<P>
   Those higher-end productions would pay more, however. Films
costing up to $4.5 million would pay $11,970, up to $30 million
would pay $200 per $500,000 and those over that would pay a maximum
of $22,370.

 CRANE SUES TO BLOCK GOODRICH TAKEOVER OF COLTEC 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By SHARON R. KING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK - The Crane Co. sought to block B.F. Goodrich's $1.5
billion takeover of Coltec Industries late Monday, contending in a
surprise lawsuit that Coltec had spurned a more generous offer from
Crane.
</P>
<P>
   In a suit filed in U.S. District Court in New York, Crane
contended that Coltec, by accepting a $1.49 billion purchase offer
from Goodrich, broke a 1995 promise to notify Crane of any purchase
offers. The suit seeks to allow Crane to present its offer, which
had never been publicly disclosed, to Coltec's board. The offer was
worth an estimated $1.6 billion as of Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A Coltec spokesman declined to comment, saying the company had
not seen a copy of the lawsuit. Goodrich officials could not be
reached for comment late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Goodrich agreed to acquire Coltec, a maker of
aerospace components based in Charlotte, N.C., offering Coltec
stockholders 0.56 Goodrich share for each Coltec share. Goodrich,
which left the tire manufacturing business in the 1980s, makes
aircraft landing gear systems and other aerospace components.
</P>
<P>
   According to letters sent by Crane's chief executive, Robert
Evans, to John Guffey Jr., Coltec's chief executive, Crane had made
an informal offer in September to purchase Coltec, offering its
shareholders 0.80 Crane share for each outstanding share of Coltec.
The September offer was followed by a formal offer in a registered
letter dated Nov. 20. It was received by Coltec on Nov. 24, one day
after the deal with Goodrich was announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me it was inadequate in September,'' Evans said
Monday. ``Then he accepted an offer that was less than adequate.''
</P>
<P>
   As of Nov. 23, the day the Coltec-Goodrich deal was announced,
the Goodrich offer valued each Coltec share at $21.98. The Crane
offer would have valued Coltec stock at $25.35 a share, or $1.8
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Coltec's stock closed Monday at $16.6875, down 62.5 cents.
Crane's stock closed at $28, up 31.25 cents, making the value of
the Coltec stock under the Crane offer $22.40 a share. Goodrich's
stock closed at $33, down 62.5 cents, placing the value of Coltec
stock under that offer at $18.48 a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a formal agreement,'' Evans said. ``We gave up rights
saying we would not make a hostile offer; we wouldn't go to their
shareholders, and we wouldn't do anything they didn't agree with.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans said he initially approached Guffey in October 1995,
offering to purchase Coltec for stock at about a 40 percent premium
over Coltec's share price then. According to the court documents,
the companies signed an agreement on Oct. 31, 1995, prohibiting
each from purchasing assets, securities or options of the other, as
well as engaging in any proxy solicitation of shareholders. They
also agreed to notify the other promptly if another company
expressed interest in a transaction.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was signed by Evans and R.J. Tubbs, Coltec's
general counsel and secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Crane's financial adviser, Warburg Dillon Read &AMP; Co., and
Coltec's adviser, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, were also bound by
the October agreement and were prohibited from giving financial
advice to other companies regarding a purchase. Officials at Morgan
Stanley, now Goodrich's financial adviser, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent Monday to Goodrich's board, Crane asked the
company to ``disavow'' certain anti-takeover provisions of its deal
with Coltec, in order to ``level the playing field'' and allow
Crane to present its competing offer to Coltec. A similar letter
was sent to Coltec's board.

COMMODITIES REGULATOR TESTIFYING ON DERIVATIVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Regulators and lawmakers have been tussling behind the scenes
over who, if anyone, might oversee the growing market for
derivatives.
</P>
<P>
   The fray is expected to continue Tuesday when the Senate
Agriculture Committee opens its hearings on derivatives and the
near collapse of Long-Term Capital Management.
</P>
<P>
   In the hot seat will be Brooksley Born, chairwoman of the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates the futures
and options market. In May, she issued a statement seeking public
comment on the derivatives market, viewed by many in the industry
as a possible first step toward regulation.
</P>
<P>
   But the nation's top regulators blasted her the same day. The
leaders of the Federal Reserve Board, the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the Treasury Department issued a joint statement
with a presidential working group on financial markets. ``We have
grave concerns about this action and its possible consequences,''
the statement said. ``We seriously question the scope of the CFTC's
jurisdiction in this area, and we are very concerned about reports
that the CFTC's action may increase the legal uncertainty
concerning certain types of OTC derivatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, these financial regulators have all expressed
concern that further moves to regulate either hedge funds or
derivatives could prove harmful or inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   Hedge funds could just as easily move offshore, escaping any
regulation, said Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan. New rules or
regulatory oversight could increase legal uncertainty in a thriving
global marketplace, wrote Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin. And SEC
Chairman Arthur Levitt has said that he would be hesitant to
``inject government into the private sector unless it's absolutely
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   The three are not entirely opposed to regulation, their
spokesmen say, but they would like the entire regulatory community
to evaluate carefully any proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Born, by contrast, has called for action. ``Swift regulatory
responses may well be needed to protect the U.S. and world
economy,'' she said this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Her position, however, appears to even be at odds with some of
her fellow commissioners. Several of them wrote to Sen. Richard
Lugar, R-Ind., chairman of the agriculture committee, last
September to say, ``We will not vote to propose or issue any new
rules, regulations, interpretations or policy statements'' to
regulate the over-the-counter market for derivatives in the next
year.
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. Born lacks critical support on Capitol Hill. Last month,
Congress essentially blocked the CFTC from doing anything for six
months while the presidential working group studied the issue.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the futures commission does, the issue is one for
the international community. ``It is questionable whether hedge
funds can be effectively directly regulated in the United States
alone,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank for International Settlements in Switzerland, which
sets voluntary guidelines for global banking regulation, is
examining ways to shed more light on and better capture the risks
of derivatives as part of its guidelines on how much capital banks
must set aside.
</P>
<P>
   The last major change in the international rules for bank
capital came in 1988, before banks became major players in the
derivatives markets. William McDonough, president of the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York and the chairman of the BIS bank
regulation committee, recently conceded, ``We have a great deal of
work left to do in this area.''

BRITISH UTILITY MAKES OFFER FOR NEW ENGLAND ELECTRIC
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Britain's utility industry made its second big American takeover
foray in a week Monday with a $3.2 billion cash offer for the New
England Electric System, a major electricity supplier in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase proposal by the National Grid Group PLC, which
operates Britain's electric transmission system, reflects the
increased opportunities seen by foreign utilities in the United
States, where many states are deregulating their utilities and
opening them to competition, much in the way the telephone industry
was deregulated years ago.
</P>
<P>
   British utilities are well positioned to exploit the opportunity
because they already have undergone deregulation at home and know
the business better than many others.
</P>
<P>
   Just a week earlier, Scottish Power agreed to buy Pacificorp,
which operates in the Pacific Northwest and is one of this
country's biggest power companies, for $7.9 billion. That deal, if
completed, would be the first foreign acquisition of a major U.S.
utility.
</P>
<P>
   National Grid said that by acquiring one of the seven utilities
that serve Massachusetts it was getting ``an excellent regional
platform for growth.''
</P>
<P>
   New England states in particular are moving quickly to give
customers a choice in choosing their supplier of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Under a deregulation plan adopted by Massachusetts, utilities in
the state have moved to spin off their generating plants. These
utilities now just transmit and distribute power but do not produce
it.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the agreement, New England Electric shareholders
would receive $53.75 in cash for each share they hold. National
Grid would also assume $1.4 billion of the company's debt.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of New England Electric jumped $5.25, or 12.2 percent, to
close Monday at $48.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   National Grid shares fell 10.75 pence to close at 488 pence, or
about $8.25, on the London Stock Exchange.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Under deregulation, New England's utility market has already
undergone substantial changes. Last week BEC Energy, the parent
company of Boston Edison, the utility that serves Boston, said it
was merging with Commonwealth Energy System, a neighboring utility.
Another foreign-owned company, Sithe Energies Inc., a subsidiary of
the giant French utility Vivendi SA, last May bought 12 power
plants from Boston Edison for $657 million.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Sergel, president and chief executive of New England
Electric, will retain those titles. He said customers would still
get the same service under British ownership. ``The only difference
is that we will have the resources of an international leader
behind us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   New England Electric will become a subsidiary of National Grid
and its headquarters will remain in Massachusetts. It has four
subsidiaries: Massachusetts Electric Co., Narragansett Electric
Co., Granite State Electric Co. and Nantucket Electric Co.

L.A. CONGRESSMEN GO PARTISAN ON IMPEACHMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVID R. BAKER AND IVAN SCIUPAC  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The vote on whether to impeach President Clinton
won't come until Thursday at the earliest, but the six congressmen
in L.A's San Fernando Valley area say they've already made up their
minds.
</P>
<P>
   And they have decided _ to a man _ to stand by their parties.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans representing parts of the valley said Monday they'll
vote to try Clinton in the Senate on accusations of committing
perjury and obstructing justice. Their Democratic colleagues said
they won't.
</P>
<P>
   All took pains not to criticize each others' positions, but the
reasons for their decisions reflect a seemingly unbridgeable
divide.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans argue that letting Clinton go unpunished would wreck
the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he isn't accountable to our laws, why should a plumber be
or a journalist or anyone?'' asked Rep. Elton Gallegly, R-Oxnard.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said allegations that Clinton tried to conceal an
affair with a former White House intern, while appalling, do not
warrant impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, the corrosive effects of the president's
wrongdoing are far exceeded by the corrosive effects on America of
nullifying the people's choice (of Clinton) in 1996,'' said Rep.
Howard Berman, D-Mission Hills. ``The American people don't want
that choice nullified.''
</P>
<P>
   Public sentiment against impeachment has not gone unnoticed in
Congress. Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Los Angeles, said he will vote
against all articles of impeachment and is dismayed the Republicans
are voting party line rather than in the direction of public
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seem to be most responsive to their core, right-wing
conservatives who have always hated President Clinton,'' said
Waxman.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans said they understand they could provoke
public wrath by pushing for impeachment. But the situation, they
said, demands that they vote their conscience regardless of the
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Congressman Howard P. ``Buck'' McKeon, R-Santa Clarita, said he
is planning to vote for impeachment because he believes the
evidence is overwhelming that the president did lie under oath and
obstruct justice.
</P>
<P>
   McKeon said he feels the president should not be able to get
away with crimes an ordinary citizen could not get away with. ``We
can't have two systems of justice in this country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James E. Rogan, R-Pasadena, who represents a district with
more registered Democrats than Republicans, admitted his vote for
impeachment could affect his political career.
</P>
<P>
   ``The solemnity of my own oath of office obliges me to do what
the president has failed to do: defend the rule of law despite any
personal or political costs,'' Rogan said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Several representatives said the vote's outcome remains too
close to call. While the Valley's House delegation may have already
decided on the issue, other representatives have yet to announce
their intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Two undecided congressmen, Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., and Jon D. Fox,
R-Pa., are accompanying Clinton on his diplomatic trip to the
Middle East. In an interview from Jerusalem on Monday, Rep. Brad
Sherman, D-Woodland Hills, also on the trip, said the two men
haven't been placed under intense presidential pressure while in
Israel, despite the situation's high stakes.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis and Palestinians encountered on the trip, Sherman
said, seem impressed that Clinton would come to their land to push
for the peace process at a time when he is under serious attack at
home. And they don't understand why the impeachment process has
come this far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone outside the country thinks we're nuts for doing so
much damage to ourselves over this issue,'' Sherman said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Clinton, Sherman said the president seems exhausted but
completely focused on the diplomatic issues at hand. Together, they
watched the Palestinian National Congress revoke elements of its
charter calling for the destruction of Israel, a moment the Jewish
Sherman said moved him even more than did visiting Jerusalem's
hallowed Western Wall.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Palestinians' historic vote, fueled by enthusiasm
over Clinton's visit, shows the president can still perform his job
in spite of the scandal. Sherman said he plans to vote against
impeachment once he returns and hopes the Democrats can muster the
218 votes needed to defeat it.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton needs 218 Hanukkah presents and I'm going to
give him one,'' he said.

FANNING THE FIRE   
 CARDS HAVE PLAYOFF FEVER, HOPE VALLEY DOES, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - For the first time in their 10-year Valley
history, the Cardinals enter the final two games of the season in
control of their playoff destiny.
</P>
<P>
   Home wins over New Orleans on Sunday and San Diego on Dec. 27
send them to the dance. It's that simple.
</P>
<P>
   And, for that matter, if Tampa Bay loses to Washington on
Saturday, the Giants tie or lose to Kansas City on Sunday and the
Cardinals win, Arizona will clinch a playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the latter scenario coming to fruition. Imagine fans at
Sunday's game celebrating wildly the team's first playoff
appearance since the strike-shortened 1982 season in front of
33,000 empty seats.
</P>
<P>
   It's the Cardinals' worst fear, but they insist the turnout will
have no bearing on the franchise's long-range future in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's meeting with the Saints simply boils down to a must-win
playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   It's being greeted with raging apathy at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   For openers, the Saints have historically been among the
Cardinals' worst draws, largely because they have no local
following _ 37,778 in October 1993, 27,735 in October '92, 30,928
in December '91. That, plus the fact that Cardinals fans have grown
accustomed to taking December off for the holidays, coupled with
the team's modest season-ticket base, have led to an advance sale
only in the high 30,000 range.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals reported ticket sales as being ``brisk and
consistent'' Monday, but hardly the stuff from which sellouts are
made. It's a fact that hasn't escaped team members or its coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for closet Cardinals fans who have been afraid to
admit it to come out,'' tackle Lomas Brown said. ``It's time for
them to wear their hats, T-shirts, paint their faces red and do all
that stuff. We need all the support we can get. It's a huge game,
for our playoff lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully fans aren't looking at us saying, `Same old
Cardinals; they'll blow it.' Hopefully, they'll be optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown is backing his mouth with his wallet, purchasing 75
tickets for donation to the Valley Big Brothers-Big Sisters.
</P>
<P>
   It's only the fourth time in the past 15 seasons that the
Cardinals (7-7) have been at .500 after 14 games. On the three
other occasions, they were either out of the hunt or didn't control
of their playoff chances. Perhaps the roller-coaster nature of a
young team has left fans more shocked than rabid about its playoff
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody talks about the playoffs, playoff fever and playoff
intensity, and that's really what this game is going to be,''
Cardinals Coach Vince Tobin said. ``If New Orleans beats us and we
finish with the same record, they'll have the tiebreaker on us.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we win, we control our destiny. It can't get more exciting
if you like pro football and the playoffs. There's something
exciting and different about playoff-type football. A tension in
the air and in the stadium. I just hope fans come out on Sunday.
It's what the home-field edge is all about your fans making it
difficult for the other team.''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of response from the ticket-buying public doesn't
lessen the Valley's standing as a NFL market in Tobin's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good market,'' Tobin said. ``Things have to build, and
there are a lot of factors. Some people have plans, and it's the
Christmas season.''
</P>
<P>
   Safety Tommy Bennett, whom Tobin credited with playing his best
game last week in Philadelphia, believes Valley fans will respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``They responded for the Dallas game when we had a chance to
take the NFC lead,'' he said. ``Hopefully, they will again. It's a
big-time game. There hasn't been a situation like this before in
Phoenix.''
</P>
<P>
   Center Aaron Graham is grateful for the loyal fans who have
attended games all along.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the people in town are as excited as we are,'' he said.
``But we know the fans who will be there will be loud. It's the way
our fans have been. There have been times when the stadium wasn't
close to full, but their noise level has had an impact. We'll be
happy with whoever is there . . . as long as they're wearing
red.'' &QL;

REAL WINNERS IN ELECTRONIC COMMERCE: CREDIT-CARD COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In many an Internet start-up company's dreams, there's a
fragment of hope that its Web site, device or software will somehow
stand at the tollbooth of the electronic commerce universe and
collect a share of every transaction made in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   That device has already arrived. It's called the credit card.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, credit-card companies have appeared to awaken
to the reality that second only to plastic, the Internet is the
best thing that ever happened to the industry. Thus this season has
seen the television advertising campaign for Visa and Internet toy
merchant eToys, Seagram's Universal Studios online promotion with
the Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Discover card, and last week's deal
between Internet service provider Earth Link Network and the
credit-card monolith MBNA Corporation, which issues Visa and
Mastercard cards.
</P>
<P>
   If the purveyors of revolving debt suddenly look like the
Internet's latest, best pal, there's good reason. Most of the deals
were conceived months ago, when it became clear that electronic
commerce meant a no-cash, no-check bazaar where consumers would use
their cards more than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been running around the office rallying the troops,
saying `We've been waiting 40 years for an opportunity like
this,''' said Joseph Vause, vice president of electronic commerce
for Visa USA.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as the E-commerce pie expands, so too grows the wealth
of the credit-card industry. At month's end, a typical E-commerce
site can send up to 2.5 percent of its revenue to the credit-card
companies to cover transaction fees. Given estimated business and
consumer Internet sales of roughly $40 billion this year,
credit-card companies expect to reap hundreds of millions in
transaction fees.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, that number is expected to skyrocket as an
ever-greater percentage of consumers turn to online shopping. Visa,
for one, estimates that it will process a total of $13 billion in
Internet charges this year, or about 1 percent of its total charge
activity. But by 2003, those umbers are expected to reach $100
billion and 11 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Given the math, ``credit-card companies are going to find that
the investments they've made are very wise ones indeed,'' said Ken
Cassar, an E-commerce analyst at the New York Internet research
firm of Jupiter Communications. Noting that consumers now make 80
percent of their purchases with cash, Cassar said, ``If credit-card
companies can move that number 5 percent'' through online
purchases, ``that's huge.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, analysts say, the credit-card company doing the most to
promote Internet spending is Visa, which holds the biggest market
share on line and off. While Visa USA, the umbrella organization
for the 21,000 financial institutions that issue the card, was
already one of the leading online advertisers in 1997, it has taken
the message to the mainstream in 1998 with the eToys holiday
promotion on television.
</P>
<P>
   The $8 million to $10 million ad campaign, for which eToys paid
nothing, has been so successful that eToys canceled its own
advertising campaigns lest it be overwhelmed by demand, Visa's
Vause said. He added, ``It's the first time we could feature a
merchant everybody could go to.''
</P>
<P>
   But even the organization's $25 million 1998 advertising budget
pales in comparison with what is being spent by some of the
Visa-affiliated financial institutions. In late October, for
instance, First USA, a Visa and Mastercard issuer, announced a
five-year, $90 million deal to advertise its credit cards on
Microsoft's MSN.com site _ and that was just one of several
marketing deals it has made with major Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Mastercard was actually the first to bring the topic of Internet
spending into prime time, with an ad that was on the ``Seinfeld''
finale in May promoting Excite's shopping channel. Mastercard has
also spent heavily on its so-called Shop Smart program in which it
endorses Internet retailers, and it is about to start another
Internet-oriented television ad.
</P>
<P>
   The Discover card, meanwhile, is capitalizing on shoppers who
only make an online purchase when they find a bargain. At
Discover's Shop Center, consumers get rebates and discounts from
selected merchants when they buy with the card.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, analysts say that American Express has been
relatively less active on line, which Cassar of Jupiter
Communications characterized as ``a huge, colossal mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a ton of potential opportunity that Amex will
basically be giving up to other credit-card associations,'' Cassar
said.
</P>
<P>
   Emily Porter, director for public affairs at American Express,
said the company ``is doing special offers online,'' such as
promoting last-minute travel bargains on its site. However, mass
media Web commerce promotion has been limited to a recent one-day
radio media tour that she conducted, ``where online shopping was
talked about in practically every interview, so we are seeking to
spread the word.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not enough. According to a recent Jupiter survey of
consumers who used credit cards to make a Web purchase this year,
55 percent used Visa, 26 percent used Mastercard, and 11 percent
used American Express. Off line, meanwhile, American Express has
16.7 percent of the market, according to Credit Card Management
magazine, while Mastercard has 27.4 percent and Visa 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For Web merchants, having the credit-card companies' support is
a boon. While off-line ads promote the medium, their online
advertising dollars help rich sites get richer, proven sites get
rich, and start-ups get by.
</P>
<P>
   Preview Travel, which earns 25 percent of its revenue from
banners that advertisers buy on its Web site, struck its biggest ad
deal this summer with Mastercard, which paid an undisclosed amount
for the right to be the ``preferred'' card at the site. For that,
Mastercard gets its logo placed throughout the site _ but in no
location more important than at the point where the customer
selects a credit card to book a reservation. Moreover, while the
order form's selection box includes other credit cards, only
Mastercard is highlighted.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the trick of the game,'' said Paul Johnson, an online
commerce analyst with the International Data Corp., an Internet
research firm in Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Mastercard says its Internet partnerships are quite successful.
``We've seen market share shifts of 30 percent with some sites,''
said Debra Coughlin, senior vice president of global advertising
for Mastercard International.
</P>
<P>
   Ad dollars notwithstanding, not all sites are convinced of the
value of such partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get a lot of offers, but nobody's come up with a compelling
enough reason for us to offer this to our customers,'' said Robert
Olson, chief operating officer of Virtual Vineyards, a wine
retailer.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, it may not matter which credit-card company gets the
customer's money. What matters is that the emerging symbiotic
relationship between silicon chips and plastic cards is nurturing
electronic commerce and bringing consumers a step closer the day
when cash is no longer king.

   NEW YORK _ Artists, scholars and politicians, including Elie
Wiesel, Toni Morrison and Gloria Steinem, criticized the
impeachment proceedings as a hypocritical sham at a rally on Monday
night at New York University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who shall judge the judges?'' asked Wiesel.
</P>
<P>
   About 700 people jammed an auditorium and an overflow room at
the rally. Organizers included NYU law professor Stephen Holmes and
the historian Sean Wilentz; both testified last week on behalf of
Clinton before the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., along with the actor Alec Baldwin,

impeachment.

   E.L. Doctorow, the novelist, said the impeachment proceedings
had ``all the legitimacy of a coup d'etat.''
</P>

   ``I can't think of an American president that hasn't lied to the
American people,'' he added. ``Perhaps the problem with Clinton is
that his lie is without grandeur.''

RANGERS' POWER PLAY MAKES THE DIFFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Late in the first period Monday night, Steve Smith,
the Calgary Flames' veteran defenseman, stood over Marc Savard's
stick. As the Rangers center tried to pick it up, Smith shoved him
aside, and when Savard got close to his stick, kicked it away.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who was the Flames' assistant coach, might have been
trying to frustrate Savard, or at least spread around the Flames'
frustration. When Savard had the stick in his hand, he and the
Rangers took advantage of most of their opportunities, capturing a
5-2 decision at Madison Square Garden to snap a two-game losing
streak.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers (11-11-7) were without Todd Harvey, who was serving
a one-game suspension for roughing Buffalo's Vaclav Varada in the
final seconds of a 2-0 loss to the Sabres last Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rangers made nearly every chance with the man advantage
count Monday night by scoring three power-play goals, matching
their season high. Savard scored first, Adam Graves scored on an
assist from Savard and Petr Nedved scored in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' special teams worked the other way, too, stopping
all six of the Flames' power-play opportunities. And then when the
Flames (11-16-2) added a man in the final minutes, sending off
goaltender Jean-Sebastien Giguere with just more than 1 minute 20
seconds remaining, Wayne Gretzky picked up the puck in the Rangers'
end and found Mathieu Schneider skating up the middle for an
empty-net goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our penalty kill's been playing really well for a little while
now,'' said Rangers goaltender Mike Richter, who had 35 saves.
``We've been playing pretty strong and solid in that department.
The forwards are doing a good job of helping out the defense, which
certainly helps the goaltender out.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach John Muckler added: ``Special teams played very well. The
first group and the second group played very well and we got three
goals off of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers felt this victory was critical because it came after
two tough defeats and the next seven games are against teams in
first- or second-place in their divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Despite controlling the action for much of the time, the Rangers
led by 3-2 heading into the final period.
</P>
<P>
   The Flames took charge early in the third, outshooting the
Rangers by 4-0 over the first five minutes and 18-5 in the period.
The Flames, who went on the power play at 7:01, spent nearly the
entire two minutes in the Rangers' end, producing four shots on
Richter.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rangers stopped that power play and went on their own a
half-minute later. John MacLean passed behind the Flames net to
Gretzky, who fed Nedved swooping from the blue line to the right
circle for a goal and a 4-2 lead.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Rangers entered the game with just one power-play goal in
their last five games, and that came from Harvey.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rangers converted on their first two opportunities
Monday night as their special teams helped build a 3-2 lead through
two periods.
</P>
<P>
   First, with seven seconds remaining in a minor penalty in the
first period, Savard poked in a loose puck after a blast by
Schneider.
</P>
<P>
   Savard then got another break, sending the puck in along the
boards from outside the blue line. But the puck hit a gap in the
glass and caromed to the front of the net, where Adam Graves was
skating in unmolested. He quickly banged it in with just two
seconds left on the power play to give the Rangers a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to rim it,'' Savard said. ``I don't know how
Graves read it. I got two good bounces. I didn't look where that
pass hit the boards.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flames' first goal was also unlikely. It came in the second
period by Smith on a pretty backhand crossing pass from Valery Bure
_ Smith's first goal since Jan. 27, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers answered just 1:22 later, with Knuble redirecting
Ulf Samuelsson's shot from the right point. Gretzky also assisted.
</P>
<P>
   But the Flames closed the gap to one goal entering the final 20
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Calgary's Theoren Fleury jostled the puck free from Gretzky
after a slightly errant pass from Nedved, took it up the left side
and Fleury wristed a shot past Richter.
</P>
<P>
   Fleury's name has come up as a possible addition to the Rangers
and the unassisted goal was just the sort of play that has created
the interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it happens, it happens,'' he said of the possibility of a
trade. ``The No. 1 priority for me is to stay in Calgary. But if it
happens, New York would be a nice place to play.''

COYOTE CONFERS WITH SEC
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTLAKE VILLAGE, Calif. _ Coyote Network Systems shares rose as
much as 36 percent Monday as the telecommunications equipment maker
said it asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate
recent heavy trading of its stock.
</P>
<P>
   Coyote said it asked for the SEC's involvement after the
financial Web site TheStreet.com reported last week that its
reporters could not locate Coyote's largest client. The online
publication also noted that some Coyote insiders had recently
registered to sell shares in the firm. The news sent Coyote stock
down sharply, dropping 54 percent between Wednesday and Friday on
exceptionally heavy volume.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to contacting the SEC, Coyote on Monday also invited
James Cramer, a co-chairman of TheStreet.com, to meet with company
officials later this week at an engineering center in Texas to
learn more about the firm. Coyote officials say they believe
TheStreet.com's coverage was potentially misleading and incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman Bros., L.P., analyst Vik Grover said both moves should
reassure investors. ``Typically, fraudulent companies don't go
running to the SEC to ask for help,'' Grover said.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, TheStreet.com said it stands by its original
stories, though editor Dave Kansas said his reporters subsequently
located the Coyote client, Crescent Communications, which
indirectly accounted for most of Coyote's second-quarter revenue.
Coyote said it sold $12 million worth of equipment to Comdisco, an
established telecom company, which in turn leased it to Crescent.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas said it was unlikely Cramer would meet with Coyote
management this week.
</P>
<P>
   In what it said was unrelated news, Coyote also announced the
appointment of a new chief financial officer, Brian Robson,
following the departure of Edward Beeman from that spot a month
ago. Company spokesman Tom Wright said state privacy laws prevent
him from discussing why Beeman left Coyote after approximately
three months on the job.
</P>
<P>
   Coyote shares ended the day up $1.125 to close at $7.6875.

LATE GOALS GIVE COYOTES SATIS FYING TIE  
 TKACHUK HURT AS UNBEATEN STREAK REACHES 5 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Celine Dione, Canada's diva version of Madonna,
brought down the house Sunday night during a standing-room-only
concert at the Molson Centre. But that was just the opening act.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes did her one better on Monday, collapsing the house
on the shell-shocked Montreal Canadiens by rallying for a 2-2 tie
with two goals in the final five minutes of regulation, pushing
their unbeaten streak to five games.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after Dione sang her hit from the movie ``Titanic,''
``My Heart'' ``Will Go On,'' the Canadiens' hearts, and those of
the 20,413 fans who jammed the arena, almost collectively stopped
when Daniel Briere and Teppo Numminen each jammed in clutch goals
on a woozy Jeff Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   Briere, the rookie center from nearby Gatineau, Quebec, scored
on a rebound at 14:53 to tie it at 1. Numminen, the veteran
defenseman from Finland, finished it up with a game-tying slap shot
at 18:07.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a couple minutes away from a win,'' said Montreal
forward Shane Corson, whose club is winless in its past seven games
(0-4-3). ``Obviously, we're disappointed. We really need to start
getting some wins.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes (17-3-4) were satisfied to skip out of town
salvaging a point. For the second straight game on this four-game
trip, they were outworked and basically outplayed. Only an inspired
third period allowed them to improve to 3-0-2 in their past five.
They have managed at least one point in 19 of their past 20
(15-1-4) and reclaimed the best record in the NHL with a
league-high 38 points.
</P>
<P>
   They lost Keith Tkachuk in the second period, however. The
team's leading goal scorer, Tkachuk aggravated a recent groin
strain and did no return. He said he hoped to play Wednesday,
though, when the Coyotes make their final appearance at Maple Leaf
Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't panic. We tried to play the same way we have all
year, playing the system, and that's why good things are happening
for us,'' said Numminen, who tallied his fifth goal. ``But still .
. . it was a sluggish game for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Nikolai Khabibulin, coming off an impressive 42-save performance
during a 2-0 shutout Saturday in Ottawa, kept them in it with
another outstanding effort. He stopped 33 shots, including what
seemed like a gazillion short-handed scoring chances by Montreal
during Phoenix's four scoreless power plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little mad about that,'' Khabibulin said, ``but I know
it happens to everybody. Probably if I wouldn't have stopped all
those (short-handed chances), I'd get more mad. But we didn't lose,
which was good.''
</P>
<P>
   Both teams had goals taken away from them.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the first period, the Coyotes' Oleg Tverdovsky
inadvertently tipped an errant shot from Martin Rucinsky into his
own goal. Luckily for Phoenix, Rucinsky's forward momentum carried
him into the crease before Tverdovsky's deflection and the goal was
waved off after a short review.
</P>
<P>
   It took just a little longer for the officials to take away a
goal by the Coyotes. They were on the power play in the second
period, and after Montreal had another couple of short-handed
scoring chances, Jyrki Lumme slid the puck over to Jeremy Roenick,
who was straddling the bottom of the right faceoff circle.
</P>
<P>
   From an almost impossible angle, Roenick one-timed a slap shot
that somehow went between Hackett (29 saves) and the post and found
the back of the net. But replays showed Rick Tocchet had the edge
of his skate over the line at the top of the crease. Instead of a
tie game at 1, it was a tie game at none.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the rule. If the skate's in the crease, there's no ifs,
ands or buts about it. That's the breaks,'' said Roenick, who would
have had his 10th goal and 30th point. ``We had to scratch and claw
again. We didn't play very well tonight, but we battled and got a
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Saku Koivu, who's one of Montreal's better skilled players,
scored the first goal that actually counted. It couldn't have been
prettier, either _ a series of dekes that fooled both Gerald Diduck
and then Khabibulin.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many respects, I'm happy to get out of here with a tie,''
said Coyotes Coach Jim Schoenfeld, who was perturbed at all the
short-handed giveaways afforded the Canadiens. ``That's something
that hasn't happened all year. We had more tonight than we've had
combined all season long.'' &QL;

NL WEST: BIG BUCKS, BIG DREAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO Gomez  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ Now that the dust has settled at baseball's winter
meetings _ what little was created from the least productive
meetings ever _ it's become fairly evident just how much muscle
resides in the National League West.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks managing general partner Jerry Colangelo lobbied
long and hard to get the Diamondbacks into the NL West. To his
credit, Colangelo has shown he is not afraid to play ball with the
big boys where it matters most.
</P>
<P>
   The division is no place for the faint of heart. With Rupert
Murdoch's FOX group owning the Los Angeles Dodgers, Jerry McMorris
and his ample checkbook heading Colorado and Colangelo in Arizona,
this is most definitely a division of big spenders.
</P>
<P>
   Add the fact that San Francisco will open a new ballpark in 2000
and San Diego two years later _ moves that traditionally allow
clubs to spend more money _ and it's simple to see just how
competitive the NL West is and can be.
</P>
<P>
   Recent events clearly illustrate why many baseball executives
are likening the NL West to the American League East, where the
game's biggest money players _ Baltimore, Boston, the Yankees and
Toronto, even though they're somewhat dormant now _ have resided
for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking from the outside in, it certainly appears the NL West
is the next monster division,'' Detroit General Manager Randy Smith
said. ``There seems to be an awful lot of money in the NL West.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the last two weeks, the division added the two most
prized pitchers on the free-agent market, Randy Johnson and Kevin
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Combined, the two pitchers will earn a mind-boggling $157.4
million from the Diamondbacks and Dodgers. Here's a little
perspective on that amount of money: It's half of what Murdoch paid
to purchase the Dodgers last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks have no idea if they will remain in the NL West
in 2000. Their fate is tied to the other owners, who can vote to
move Arizona into the AL after next season as part of an expected
major restructuring of the two leagues.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, we'll assume they'll stay.
</P>
<P>
   And if these five teams continue together, the NL West could
pass the AL East in spending habits. The expected payrolls of the
five NL West clubs in 1999 is projected to be a staggering $309
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a division of teams that obviously have the wherewithal
to reach for big pieces,'' said Diamondbacks General Manager Joe
Garagiola Jr. ``The future health of this division has some pretty
serious firepower, which should be exciting for fans.''
</P>
<P>
   The five AL East teams combined to pay $270 million in payroll
last season. They appear to be headed toward a combined payroll of
around $305 million, a figure that is even more astounding
considering Tampa Bay and Toronto will probably be under $35
million each.
</P>
<P>
   The landscape of baseball has definitely changed. It's a game
where spending money appears to be the only way to ensure
contending. Of the eight clubs that qualified for the playoffs this
year, all had payrolls over $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Only Anaheim, Toronto and San Francisco, which were all over $43
million, managed to produce winning records without reaching the
$50 million threshold last season.
</P>
<P>
   The big-league scene is in serious trouble when more than half
of the 30 clubs will enter spring training knowing they have
absolutely no chance of reaching the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   It's a problem that could shut the game down for an indefinite
period in the near future. Until then, only the rich seem capable
of playing competitive baseball.
</P>
<P>
   While all of the poorer revenue-generating clubs cry out for
change, the five big boys in the NL West all shoulder up wanting a
piece of each other.
</P>
<P>
   The game is definitely in need of change. In the meantime, it
appears Arizona fans will be the recipients of a good,
old-fashioned western shootout, National League style. &QL;

NEED FAVOR? GO TO WORK FOR OLYMPICS

<P>
   PHOENIX - It's obvious now why we didn't get the Winter Olympics
and Salt Lake City did.
</P>
<P>
   The Salt Lake Organizing Committee has admitted that while
making its pitch for the 2002 Games, it provided members of the
International Olympic Committee _ the fossils who vote _ with free
dental work, surgical procedures and college scholarships for their
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   We handed out Cardinals tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Just kidding.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix didn't bid on the Winter Games, for obvious reasons. We
don't have snow. Even if we did, there are enough winter visitors
in the Valley without importing more from Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine plane loads of healthy-looking fellows named Hans and
Ernst arriving at Sky Harbor Airport with their skis and bobsleds
and perfect white smiles and asking us in broken English how to get
from the 101 to the 202 and what the distance is in kilometers.
</P>
<P>
   Where would we put the luge?
</P>
<P>
   And who would pay for it?
</P>
<P>
   But Salt Lake City coveted the world's winter sports carnival.
So did nine European cities. The IOC chose Utah's capital. &QL; 
What's your price? &QL; 
Salt Lake City is a great place. People are upstanding, friendly.
Proud of their community. Kevin White begged Rick Majerus, the Utah
basketball coach, to leave for Arizona State. He wouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   But now folks in Utah and Switzerland are wringing their hands
in the wake of embarrassing allegations of vote-buying and payoffs.
</P>
<P>
   A respected member of the IOC inner cabinet blew the whistle,
loudly. Marc Hodler claimed the last four Olympic elections were
corrupted by bribery.
</P>
<P>
   What is unclear is how these Salt Lake City favors were offered.
</P>
<P>
   Did someone sidle up to a visiting IOC member during a fancy
banquet and say, ``Pssst, want a free root canal?''
</P>
<P>
   It's possible, I suppose, that some IOC executive was putting
off gallbladder surgery for lack of funds or insurance. Then
someone in the know, someone well-connected, whispered that he
could arrange the procedure free of charge (in exchange for his
vote). The Olympic guy listened, thoughtfully, finger pressed to
his lips. ``If you'll throw in a Harvard scholarship for my nephew,
sure . . .''
</P>
<P>
   IOC policy prohibits members from receiving gifts worth more
than $150.
</P>
<P>
   You can't get a porcelain crown for that. Forget bridge work. &QL; 
Nice work if you can get it &QL; 
IOC members have the best jobs in sports, which is probably why
it's such an exclusive club. Hard to get in. Like Augusta National,
there's probably a 20-year waiting list.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC headquarters aren't in Waco, Texas. They are in
Lausanne, the quaint Swiss town on the shore of Lake Geneva. These
gentlemen gather around the fireplace. Sipping brandy, they discuss
Olympic issues of the day while wondering whatever happened to
Sonja Henie.
</P>
<P>
   They also visit the cities that bid on the Games. Limos whisk
them to a five-star hotel where the general manager greets them
with open arms while bellhops scurry about the lobby, knocking each
other over fighting for the luggage. Chambermaids drop polite
curtsies, and fluff their pillows.
</P>
<P>
   They are wined. Dined. Toasted. Courted. Flattered. Fawned over.
</P>
<P>
   These guys probably eat more hors d'oeuvres than any organized
body in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake City tried for many years to get the votes to stage
the Winter Games. So when it finally happened, 40,000 poured onto
the streets. The Mormon Tabernacle Choir sang ``America the
Beautiful.'' Fireworks lit the sky.
</P>
<P>
   People wept.
</P>
<P>
   Now come allegations of impropriety. No surprise. The IOC wields
incredible power. Olympic votes are worth millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine having that kind of influence.
</P>
<P>
   You're an IOC member, standing on a street corner.
</P>
<P>
   You don't even have your hand out. A stranger walks up, winks
and puts a brand new set of dentures in your blazer pocket.
</P>
<P>
   No questions asked. &QL;

SMITH CONFIDENT HE'LL PLAY SUNDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Defensive tackle  &UR; Mark Smith plans to play Sunday
against the New Orleans Saints, although it will be a surprise to
Coach &UR; Vince Tobin.
</P>
<P>
   ``My ankle is getting better with treatment every day,'' said
Smith, who ditched the crutches he was using last week. ``I hope to
test it in practice on Friday and then play on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobin, however, sounded less optimistic when asked about the
availability of Smith, middle linebacker  &UR; Ron McKinnon (strained
knee) and cornerback  &UR; Tommy Knight (hamstring connector) for
Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would probably be listed in the questionable to doubtful
range,'' Tobin said. ``I'll have to see how they are on Wednesday
and Thursday. There has to be significant improvement to be where I
think they will be healthy enough to help us, but stranger things
have happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they want to play, badly. If they're physically able,
they will certainly do their best to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Offensive guard/tackle  &UR; Matt Joyce, who has been sidelined for a
month after having a broken knuckle joint surgically repaired, said
he will be able to play with the aid of a cast. Receiver/returner
 &UR; Eric Metcalf sprained an ankle Sunday but is expected to play. &QL; 
Missing middle &QL; 
With Smith, defensive tackle  &UR; Eric Swann and McKinnon sidelined and
McKinnon's backup,  &UR; Mark Maddox, playing on an injured knee, the
Cards were vulnerable to the run up the middle, and the Eagles took
advantage in the first half before defensive coordinator  &UR; Dave
McGinnis went to a five-man defensive front.
</P>
<P>
   But a quick fix doesn't prohibit the Saints from trying to
exploit the same weakness. The injuries eventually forced the
Cardinals to play undersized  &UR; Terry Irving at middle linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   ```We've had the five-man package all year on and off, and it
has helped us on occasion,'' Tobin said. ``It's like anything, when
you do the same thing all the time, people will find ways to attack
it. It kind of changed the flow of the game and they went away from
some of the things that we were having problems with in the first
half and tried to throw the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as far as the overall solution, there is no overall
solution other than the guys who are playing there have got to play
better and more consistent in order to play the run. We hope to
solidify that area and make them go elsewhere.'' &QL; 
Extra points &QL; 
It was pointed out to Tobin that two Cardinals wins and two losses
by suddenly struggling Dallas would make the Cards NFC East champs.
His response: ``I don't get too excited about things we can't
control. All we need to do is control where we are. All we need to
think about is beating New Orleans.''
</P>
<P>
   The win at Philadelphia was Arizona's first December road win
since 1993; the Cards' 4-4 road record is the best since 1984; and
their 4-4 NFC East record is their best since 1994. &QL;

CUMMINS FROZEN OUT  
 COYOTE WAITS FOR OPENING IN LINEUP

<P>
   MONTREAL _ The Zamboni driver leaned against the glass, arms
folded in front of his chest, impatiently waiting for the last
Coyotes player to get off the ice Monday morning so he could
resurface it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In another five minutes,'' a Molson Centre security guard
said, ``they're going to turn the lights out on that guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Cummins wouldn't have cared. After being a healthy scratch
in 13 straight games, including Monday night's date against the
Montreal Canadiens, he'd skate in the dark to get more ice time.
For now, the only extra minutes the 6-foot-2, 216-pound right wing
can get come during practices and morning skates.
</P>
<P>
   Cummins, to his credit, refuses to publicly bemoan his
situation, saying he doesn't want to create a distraction while the
team is on a roll. Privately, he is beside himself, but he politely
declines interview requests on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason Jimmy isn't playing has nothing to do with Jim
Cummins,'' Coach Jim Schoenfeld said. ``Jimmy could play on any
team in the league, including ours. But it doesn't take a hockey
scholar to see there are very few places where Jim could fit into
the lineup right now. He's not on the top two lines, he's not a
penalty killer, and he's not a defensive specialist.''
</P>
<P>
   The only way Cummins can get back into the lineup is if
Schoenfeld decides to sit youngsters Brad Isbister or Shane Doan.
Or if an injury pops up. Neither scenario has happened. So Cummins,
28, keeps biding his time, waiting as impatiently as the Canadiens'
Zamboni driver to get back to work.
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld has told him he doesn't have to suit up and take
pre-game warmups. But Cummins is out there every night, a half-hour
before opening faceoff, skating with his teammates until it's time
to walk back to the dressing room and change into his suit and tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a great soldier all year,'' Schoenfeld said. ``He's
never complained. He's worked hard every day. His teammates have a
high regard for him. Fortunately for us, we haven't had any
injuries. But who knows? Once Jimmy gets back in, he might be the
hard guy to take out.''
</P>
<P>
   It had to have been extra hard on Cummins to miss Monday's game.
He played his first NHL game in Montreal in 1991-92 when he was in
the Detroit organization. He didn't score, but after a three-hour
truck drive from Adirondack, N.Y., where he was playing for the Red
Wings' farm club at the time, he did get into a fight and record
seven penalty minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard because every athlete wants to play,'' Schoenfeld
said. ``There are guys ``in'' the lineup who you'd like to find
more ice time for. But who do I take it away from?''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes can't assign Cummins to a minor league club in order
to give him some playing time. He'd have to clear waivers, and
another NHL team surely would gobble him up in a second. The team
doesn't want to trade him, either. But what about throwing the
physical Cummins into a game against a rough-and-tumble team simply
to ensure protection?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Schoenfeld said. ``I don't think it would be fair to
Jimmy to say, `OK, we're expecting a tough game. Go in there and
beat somebody up tonight.' I don't think he wants to be that. He
wants to be a hockey player. He's more than willing to handle that.
He's more than willing to stick up for his teammates. He's done
that his whole career. But our teammates all stick up for each
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have great team toughness. We have great team courage. When
teams start to try and tough it up, man, we just grit our teeth all
the more. We love it.''
</P>

TERRY, UA SHOW IRVINE WHO'S BOSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ UC-Irvine's Jerry Green may be a talented young player
and his team's leading scorer, but he's still a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   Which means he still has a few things to learn, including what
is better left unsaid. Arizona's Jason Terry provided a little
reminder of that Monday night, leading Arizona to a convincing
93-70 blowout of the Anteaters at McKale Center.
</P>
<P>
   Green, who came into the game averaging 13.5 points, told a
Tucson newspaper this week that he was looking forward to playing
Arizona. And he claimed he was not at all intimidated by Terry, the
Wildcats' senior point guard and a notoriously tenacious defender.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's human, just like me,'' Green reasoned.
</P>
<P>
   And he was right. But the comparison ended about there Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Terry dominated Green and the Anteaters as the eighth-ranked
Wildcats pushed their record to 5-0. Green didn't score a point
until five minutes into the second half, and then he needed a lane
violation by the Wildcats while he was shooting the second of two
free throws to get on the board. He finished with six points, and
five came during mop-up time after Terry called it a night.
</P>
<P>
   Terry, meanwhile, was magnificent, scoring 21 points, handing
out nine assists and making five steals. ``I didn't see what he
said, but the coaches told me about it right before the game,''
Terry said, grinning. ``That kind of sparked me up. I like looking
at the roster and seeing a freshman guard. I start to smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played hard, but our defense pretty much took them out of
what they wanted to run, and (Green) wasn't much of a factor.''
</P>
<P>
   After scoring 11 first-half points to stake the Wildcats to a
43-30 lead, Terry settled the issue early in the second half. He
had a hand in 12 of Arizona's points in a 21-9 run that pushed the
lead to 64-39. He scored eight points and handed out a pair of
assists during the burst, and Irvine (2-4) was finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough playing against Jason Terry,'' Green said. ``He's
a future NBA player, and I'm just a freshman. It was definitely a
learning experience playing against their guards. I'm going to keep
my head up after this game and just keep going. (Terry) played good
defense. I just have to learn to play through that kind of
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The game provided just what it was supposed to - a nice stretch
for the Wildcats in the middle of final exams. It is the only game
the Wildcats play during a 13-day span because of finals, and it
wasn't meant to be too taxing.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a Wildcats team still in the making, despite a lofty
national ranking.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Lute Olson used his fifth starting lineup in five games,
this time moving freshman Richard Jefferson from the small forward
spot to shooting guard. And Olson moved 6-foot-7 sophomore Justin
Wessel to small forward.
</P>
<P>
   With 6-10 A.J. Bramlett in the middle and 6-6 Eugene Edgerson
returning after a one-game suspension to the power-forward
position, the Wildcats put an imposing lineup on the floor.
Edgerson, whose suspension was imposed by Olson because of an elbow
that knocked out Brigham Young center Bret Jepsen, started in place
of freshman Michael Wright. But it didn't matter which combination
Olson used; the Anteaters were out-manned.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson, the 6-6 product of Moon Valley High School, didn't
appear to have much trouble adjusting, offensively at least. He
scored Arizona's first seven points of the game, hitting a pair of
free throws, connecting from three-point range and then dropping in
a pull-up jump shot from 17 feet. Jefferson went on to score a
season-high 13 points.
</P>
<P>
   The big lineup led to a whopping 47-23 edge for the Wildcats on
the boards. &QL;

IT'S DECEMBER, AND MARINERS ARE ALREADY DONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Angels added Mo Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners added Tom Lampkin.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers added Rafael Palmiero and Todd Stottlemyre.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners added Matt Mieske and Butch Huskey.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the local club, baseball is not boxing, where
the lack of a counterpunch is often immediately career-ending. The
Mariners won't see stars and little birdies from this offseason
until, oh, May or so.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's trade with the New York Mets for right fielder Butch
Huskey _ who fits perfectly the Mariner profile of the big-swing,
no-glove, lead-legged strongman that has served the club so
inadequately _ meant the Mariners ended baseball's winter meetings
as they entered.
</P>
<P>
   On cat's feet.
</P>
<P>
   The only stir caused by what was once one of baseball's more
glamorous teams was a curious news story last week that said the
Mariners four months ago offered contract extensions to Ken Griffey
Jr. and Alex Rodriguez worth $70 million each.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out there were no offers, no figures and certainly no
acceptances. The Mariner superstars each have two years left on
their contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Given the standard swelling in the player-payroll market this
winter _ which apparently was a surprise to no one but the
Mariners' Woody Woodward _ Griffey and Rodriguez would have to be
re-named Laurel and Hardy if they even looked at offers this
prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   The story looked as if it were planted by the Mariners in order
to make it seem as if the club was actually doing something this
offseason other than wringing hands. A member of the organization
said yesterday that there was no such scheme.
</P>
<P>
   The months-ago conversation was to let Griffey and Rodriguez
know, in light of the Randy Johnson debacle, that they were indeed
wanted. The club also needed to know if the players' feelings were
mutual.
</P>
<P>
   So far, they are. But in the first two months of the Hot Stove
League, Griffey and Rodriguez have to notice the obvious _ the
Mariners are even lower in the standings than they were in the
American League West.
</P>
<P>
   In Lampkin, Mieske and Huskey, the Mariners have acquired the
'99 season's Rick Wilkins, Rico Rossy and Glenallen Hill _
borderline major leaguers who came cheap.
</P>
<P>
   The club's pre-meeting rhetoric was about acquiring a starting
pitcher, some leadoff speed and a right fielder. While those
acquisitions could happen between now and spring training, it's
apparent that the Mariners have no real prospects for improvement.
</P>
<P>
   If the fact that Woodward spent barely 24 hours at the meetings,
while many other club executives were there five days, means
anything, figure that the Mariners' shuffle of mediocre journeymen
is about it for the '99 roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed, I really am,'' Mariner manager Lou Piniella
said Friday after the first day of meetings about the lack of
Mariner acquisitions. ``We're in a position now where we need to
get some things done in fairly quick fashion, because after the
holidays, heck, spring training's here.''
</P>
<P>
   Hard to imagine Piniella's tune changed after the acquisition of
Huskey, whose first name perhaps is an abbreviation for the
description of his defensive skills.
</P>
<P>
   A lifer in the Mets' organization, Huskey was moved from third
to first to the outfield when it was apparent he was a danger to
himself and others in the infield.
</P>
<P>
   With Huskey starting in right, Jay Buhner moving to first base
from right, and David Segui moving from first to left field, the
Mariners have a good chance to add to their 125 errors last year
that was the AL's third worst total.
</P>
<P>
   All that Huskey cost the Mariners was one of their brighter
young pitching prospects, something that was deemed virtually
untouchable. Although information on Lesli Brea is limited, the
fact that the Mariners have traded him suggests at the latest,
he'll be in the 2004 All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot has been apparent for months: Unless serendipity
strikes, the Mariners are non-factors for '99. And the franchise
used up most of its supply of serendipity in '95.
</P>
<P>
   What is less obvious is another twist in the foolish cruelty of
baseball's system. While it is well-known that ownership refuses to
run with the big dogs of Fox, Disney, Turner and Steinbrenner, the
franchise, with baseball's 10th-highest gross revenues last year,
is obligated to be a payer in baseball's revenue-sharing plan.
</P>
<P>
   For this season, the Mariners' portion of the pot going to
poorer teams is estimated to be more than $4 million, after paying
$3.7 million in 1997 and $613,000 in '96.
</P>
<P>
   What that means is the Mariners are helping subsidize at least
half of the major league teams, while falling further behind the
clubs whose payrolls permit championship contention.
</P>
<P>
   As Dave Niehaus likes to say: unbeLEEVable.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners are in an economic no-man's land, which doesn't
sound like a place Griffey and Rodriguez would want to play out
their careers.

 &HT;    Santa Claus may be lots of fun, but Wall Street is real
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Too many of us think Santa Claus has moved to Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Gallup Poll sponsored by PaineWebber showed investors
expect 15 percent returns from the stock market in coming years,
and new investors think returns could go as high as 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Not likely. ``The last three or four years, a return of 20 or 25
percent was reasonable,'' said Billy Williams, president of the
Atlanta Council of the National Association of Investors Corp.
``But over the long term, that's not a reasonable expectation.''
</P>
<P>
   What we can reasonably expect is what we have seen over many
years: some Santa Claus years, some so-so years and some Grinch
years.
</P>
<P>
   From 1995 through 1997, large-company stocks have more than
doubled in value. This year, the S&AMP;P 500 index is up another 24
percent, even after the dog days of August and September.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not normal. Over 25 years _ which includes the Grinch
years of 1973-74, 1981, 1987 and others _ returns have averaged
13.1 percent. Take it back through 1926, and the record shows that
stocks will return 11 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson: Santa Claus is fun, but Wall Street is real.
</P>
<P>
   The consequences of unreal expectations can be painful. ``You
can't stay unreasonable,'' said Elizabeth Jetton, a certified
financial planner with Financial Vision Associates. ``One of the
things people do when high expectations aren't met is that they
think there's a problem. They panic and get out of the game. That's
the worst thing they can do.''
</P>
<P>
   So what can you do to lock onto reality?
</P>
<P>
   The first step is to recognize the stock market is not a
get-rich-quick scheme. Here's an old adage from cynical investors:
``Bulls make money. Bears make money. Pigs get slaughtered.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers on the chart are not hypothetical. They are factual
reports on the real world. They are also about the best estimates
you can get of how that world will behave in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some ways to help keep your feet on the ground:
</P>
<P>
   _ Make sure you have a safe harbor. Every family should have an
emergency fund. You may also need a short-term savings program, for
things like buying a house two years from now, or putting children
into college next fall. Only long-term investments should be in the
stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the reason: Over that 72 years of Ibbotson data, you
would have lost money in 20 of them. In the worst year, a $100
investment would have turned into $43.34. That's too much
volatility for savings you know you will need soon.
</P>
<P>
   _ Deal with your panic potential. You might ask yourself, what
if I put $2,000 into an IRA in August, and my stock is now worth
$1,600? Am I embarrassed? Suicidal? Would I just sell the stuff and
tell a broker or banker to buy something safe?
</P>
<P>
   The point is to establish a level of volatility you can live
with, in good times or bad.
</P>
<P>
   _ Examine some real-world investments. You could go to the
library, pick up Value Line and check the record of a stock you
like. Or pick up the Morningstar reports and look up the mutual
funds in your retirement plan. You will probably find they have
good years and bad years, just like most other investments, most
marriages and some football teams.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stop listening to the daily, even hourly market chatter in the
media. All it can do is make you antsy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Go back to basics. The ideal is to figure out how much money
you need to meet your goals, how much risk you're willing to take
along the way, and how long you have to get the job done.
</P>
<P>
   Then you can start comparing those personal needs with the
impersonal performance of stocks, bonds and other investments.
</P>
<P>
   For example, what happens if all of your 401(k) contributions go
into stock mutual funds? ``Let's look at what that has returned
over a long period of time,'' said Jetton. ``We'll put that data in
and see if it works out.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it will show a moderately risky set of stock investments
will raise the money you want. ``If it doesn't,'' Jetton continued,
``I'm going tell you to save more money, change your goals, work
longer or take more risk.''
</P>
<P>
   However it works out, you have developed a rational idea of what
you need to do. That's better than waiting for Santa Claus.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, it's better than waiting for the Grinch.
</P>

 &HT;    Surviving Battle of the Bulge was a matter of luck and
circumstance
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ George Fisher will raise a glass at 3
p.m. Wednesday in salute to the good men who died around him 54
years ago at the Battle of the Bulge. He knows thousands of other
veterans around the country will do the same, but not as many as
last year.
</P>
<P>
   World War II veterans are dying faster in retirement than in
battle: 31,500 a month and rising. ``Someday, there won't be anyone
left to tell of the horror,'' Fisher says.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that, feeling it in the gut, is driving Fisher and his
comrades to do something that once seemed impossible for most of
them. They are talking about the war.
</P>
<P>
   He is particularly eager to talk about The Bulge, Hitler's last,
furious drive across Europe. Fisher left too many friends in the
frozen fields of Belgium and Luxembourg to let one of the war's
bloodiest battles be remembered as a comic line in diet
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   So Fisher, 74, traveled from his home in Palm Beach to
Tallahassee, Fla. early this year to record his story for the World
War II archives at Florida State University. Then last month, he
and some buddies who retired here went back to Providence College
in Rhode Island with a bronze plaque commemorating 37 of their
classmates killed in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us who survived this thing _ I don't know how to
explain it, but there's a kind of glue between us,'' Fisher says.
``We were all just a breath away from that plaque.''
</P>
<P>
   He learned early that survival would be a matter of luck and
circumstance. He didn't expect to be in battle at all.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after he was drafted, Fisher passed the test for the Army
Specialized Training Program that was supposed to keep the service
stocked with doctors, lawyers and other professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher wanted to be a dentist. He was sent off to Providence
College with the government's promise of a second lieutenant's
commission. But when plans for D-Day brought the demand for fresh
troops, he and about 500 classmates got privates' stripes instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``They woke us up in the middle of the night and told us we were
going,'' he says. ``They put us on a windowless train and dumped us
in the middle of a field in Tennessee.''
</P>
<P>
   A hefty sergeant greeted them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `OK, college boys, you have your choice: Do you want
to be a rifleman, a machine gunner or a mortar man?'''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher chose rifleman. So did classmates Larry Treff and Leon
Davidow. They arrived in France with the 26th Infantry, the Yankee
Division, on Sept. 8. They trudged past the wreckage of Normandy a
little more than three months after the invasion.
</P>
<P>
   By October, they were on the front lines and stayed there for
more than 60 days of shooting and being shot at _ without a shower
or a hot meal or a full night's sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Then they got word that fresher troops had arrived. That meant a
break from the front, a chance to rest far from the front in the
recently liberated French city of Metz.
</P>
<P>
   ``At last, we got a hot meal and a hot shower,'' Fisher says.
When he was cleaned up, Fisher had a photographer take a picture to
send home as proof he was fit and well. The idyll lasted just two
days.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, someone woke him up in the middle of the night. ``We
were told to move out quickly,'' he says. ``All we knew is that
something happened. We had no inkling.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened was a thunderous breach of the Belgian front by
German Panzer tanks and 250,000 troops. The 75,000 Allied defenders
spread thin along the German border were overwhelmed, falling back
into a deep pocket in the Ardennes forest that left a bulge in the
line.
</P>
<P>
   The attack was as surprising as Japan's raid on Pearl Harbor for
reasons as mysterious and hotly debated. The Allies' failure to
detect such an enormous buildup a few miles away has been called
one of history's greatest intelligence failures.
</P>
<P>
   But the failure of military and political leaders, who had begun
to take victory for granted, was even greater.
</P>
<P>
   Their embarrassment may help explain why the Battle of the Bulge
doesn't instantly conjure the glorious image that D-Day does.
Normandy was a battle the generals and politicians could boast
about. The Bulge was a battle that shouldn't have happened.
</P>
<P>
   Both were victories of common soldiers rising to an
extraordinary challenge. This was America's greatest surprise for
Germany: Regular Joes could fight like hell.
</P>
<P>
   Hitler had failed to learn that lesson, even after his Wermacht
was pushed from the Atlantic and chased back into Germany. He was
convinced that his December offensive would cut straight through
the Allied forces all the way to The Netherlands, leaving them so
demoralized that they would either surrender or agree to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson was driven home when the Nazis rolled up to Bastogne,
at the crossroads of important routes through Belgium. Ordered to
surrender, Brig. Gen. Anthony McAuliffe issued the most famous and,
to the Germans, perplexing reply of the war: Nuts.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe and the 101st Airborne held tight while Gen. George
Patton's Third Army rushed north to relieve them. Of more than
600,000 men the Allies eventually threw into the battle, nearly all
were Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Among them were three college boys/riflemen roused from leave in
Metz: Fisher, Treff and Davidow.
</P>
<P>
   Treff, 73, and now of Boynton Beach, Fla., and Davidow, 74, of
Wellington, Fla., are among the local Bulge veterans who found each
other at reunions over the years and renewed their friendships.
</P>
<P>
   They met for one of their occasional lunches shortly before this
year's battle anniversary and talked about their sudden return to
combat on Dec. 16, 1944.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put us in trucks and we headed north,'' Fisher says.
``Our only order was to engage the enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidow remembers the ride clearly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You heard shells, small arms fire,'' he says. ``It gets
louder, and you know you're getting closer. You know soon they'll
dump you off.''
</P>
<P>
   The trucks stopped as shells exploded all around. The troops
were ordered out, lined up and set marching. ``We didn't know where
we were, or where we were going,'' Fisher says. ``I have no idea
how far we marched or how long.''
</P>
<P>
   He remembers that it was terribly cold and snowy. Hitler planned
his attack for the worst weather, expecting it would add to the
Americans' misery and ground their planes. He was right.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a horrible experience,'' Fisher says.
</P>
<P>
   It took days to reach where the bodies lay, where the cold men
who'd come before were already fighting. Each rifleman unfolded his
pack shovel and began stabbing at the frozen ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't dig, but you had to,'' Fisher says. ``If you
didn't dig a foxhole, you'd die.'' So they dug, they chopped, they
set off explosives. When there were holes big enough, two men
jumped into each one.
</P>
<P>
   They performed the ritual over and over. The Battle of the Bulge
was a tortuous, six-week campaign through dense woods and ruined
towns. It was as much a battle against the snow and cold as against
the enemy; casualties from infected or frost-bitten feet rivaled
those from bullets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't trained to deal with any of it,'' Fisher says.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans improvised as they fought, wrapping themselves in
paper and blankets, and bed sheets for camouflage. They used their
body heat to keep their ammo and medicines from freezing. And still
their guns jammed, their engines froze, their teeth chattered.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd do anything to warm up just for a little while,''
Davidow says. Sometimes, they did the wrong thing and paid for it.
He remembers walking into an abandoned house and seeing a big, soft
bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There must have been a dozen of us who jumped in to get
warm,'' he says. ``The mistake we made was taking off our boots.''
</P>
<P>
   The crackle of small-arms fire rousted them, but by then it was
dark. There was no way, no time, to sort through the pile of boots.
Davidow managed to grab one of his own, but the other was too small
and soaking wet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I limped through the rest of the war with an infected foot,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   The talk turns to other injuries, and Fisher recalls the
ambivalence men felt about wounds. He's fond of a quote about
riflemen by Gen. Omar Bradley, who directed the battle: ``After
weeks or months in the line only a wound can offer him the comfort
of safety, shelter and a bed.''
</P>
<P>
   Every soldier feared death but secretly wished for a wound just
bad enough to get him sent home. They called that a Million Dollar
Wound, almost too much to hope for when most anyone who could walk
was patched up and sent back into action.
</P>
<P>
   Davidow had the chance for a Purple Heart when an explosion
tossed him through the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how long I was knocked out, but I was dazed for a
long time after,'' he says. ``I looked down and saw I was bleeding.
I had little pieces of shrapnel all over my stomach.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidow made his way to an aid station, but stopped when he saw
others ahead of him dying. ``I felt embarrassed to ask for help,''
he says. ``I couldn't ask for a medal.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing how much others were suffering kept most men from giving
in, Fisher says. ``You had plenty of company, and you knew you
weren't the worst off,'' he says. ``You also knew that someday it
had to be over.''
</P>
<P>
   Thinking about home was a comfort but also a worry. No one
wanted his folks to know how bad things really were.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in a beautiful house near the fire,'' Fisher wrote from
his freezing foxhole.
</P>
<P>
   Treff drew strength from the silver Star of David that hung from
his neck. His maternal grandmother gave it to him for his bar
mitzvah. ``People kept telling me to get rid of it because of what
might happen if I got captured,'' he says. ``But I wouldn't do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of the three college boys held up as long as he had to.
None lasted until the end of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher got his Million Dollar Wound on the morning of Jan. 3,
1945, while advancing on a German position outside the town of
Wiltz, Luxembourg. An exploding shell drove shrapnel through his
left leg. He was still in a hospital in England when Germany
surrendered in June.
</P>
<P>
   The Battle of the Bulge had reached the turning point when
Fisher fell. Treff and Davidow kept up the fight. The Germans were
back in Germany by Jan. 28, decimated and on the run. More than
10,000 Americans had died in the battle.
</P>
<P>
   Treff got his Million Dollar Wound later, while chasing the
enemy across the Rhine. He was a master sergeant by then, leading a
patrol when he was hit in the right leg by machine gun fire.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't bleed much because the bullets were so hot the wounds
were self-cauterizing, but his bones were shattered. Weak and about
to pass out, he made a sudden, painful decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pulled off the Star of David and threw it as far as I
could,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He was captured moments later. He was a prisoner of war for 13
days in a make-shift care center. He heard a rumble as hiscaptors
abandoned the place and the Americans marched in.
</P>
<P>
   An American captain, thinking the wounded men were Germans,
tried speaking in a language they might understand. Treff called
out: ``Captain, your German stinks, but your Yiddish is
beautiful!''
</P>
<P>
   Davidow's ticket home was a virulent case of hepatitis from
drinking water someone had forgotten to purify. Through the
differing circumstances of the three comrades' survival ran a
common determination to focus on anything else in the world but
what they'd been through.
</P>
<P>
   Each went back to college. Each got married. Each had a good
career: Fisher in real estate management, Treff in textiles,
Davidow as an accountant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never talked to my children about the war,'' says Treff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never even told my wife I was in combat,'' echoes Davidow.
``I was so sick of the idea of people killing each other. I didn't
even think about it until the reunion.''
</P>
<P>
   That was 10 years ago, about the same time Treff was interviewed
by the author of a book about The Bulge. When he discovered he
could talk about the war, and that people would listen, Treff
joined a prisoner-of-war speakers group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to middle school kids about what it's like to lose
your personal freedom,'' he says. ``I only lost mine for 13 days,
but I'll never forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher was struck by a letter published last month in a
veterans' bulletin. A Wisconsin woman wrote that her father had
died without ever telling her about his war experience. She asked
other veterans to talk while they had time.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher wrote to tell her she's right. Yet it's only at the end
of a two-hour interview, and only in response to a direct question,
that Fisher acknowledges his own war-time heroics. He was awarded
the Bronze Star for crawling toward a German machine gun nest and
tossing in a grenade.
</P>
<P>
   He says only, ``You do foolish things when you're 19.'' He
prefers to talk about the 37 names on the plaque. ``They deserve to
be honored.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidow hopes that by talking about the misery of war, veterans
can make an impression on young people. ``They have to see that it
makes no sense to keep having wars, that there has to be a better
way.''
</P>
<P>
   He's quick to add that he has no regrets, no second thoughts
about fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It built in us a sense of confidence, self-reliance,'' he
says. ``You know you can face anything. It gives you an
appreciation of life.''

 &HT;    History made in cord blood transplant
 &HT;    (Eds: A compilation of health stories that moved from Cox News
Service in the past week.)
 &HT;    Staff reports
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Medical history unfolded at Egleston Children's
Hospital last week with the world's first cord blood transplant for
sickle cell anemia.
</P>
<P>
   The blood recipient, Keone Penn, was sleepy from 10 days of
chemotherapy to kill his unhealthy bone marrow, and painkillers.
But he awoke long enough to help pediatric nurse practitioner Ellen
Olson squeeze stem blood cells into his left arm.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors will know in three to four weeks if the transplant has
taken hold.
</P>
<P>
   Should the procedure work, it could help many severely ill
children with sickle cell anemia who do not have a relative with
matching bone marrow. Bone marrow is the spongy liquid inside bones
where blood cells form and mature. The experimental procedure poses
great risk because the patient's immune-fighting white cells are
wiped out, leaving him open to infections.
</P>
<P>
   ``This protocol is ahead of its time,'' said Dr. Angela Ogden,
one of the specialists treating Keone. ``But he's not your typical
sickle cell kid. Taking the additional risk . . . is acceptable in
his case, until we know that umbilical cord transplant will work
for sickle cell. If it does, we can offer it to kids with less
severe disease.''
</P>
<P>
   The 12-year-old Keone received the equivalent of about eight
tablespoons of stem cell blood. It came from an anonymous woman who
consented to have her placenta and umbilical cord donated to the
New York Blood Center. Rich in stem cells that grow into the three
components of blood, cord blood has been used in nearly 600
procedures around the world in patients suffering from leukemia and
other immune and genetic disorders.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure has never been tried on sickle cell disease, which
affects 70,000 people nationwide, most of whom are
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   New decontaminant for anthrax
</P>
<P>
   Researchers recently announced test results for a new
decontaminant against anthrax and other significant biological
warfare agents. Dr. James R. Baker Jr., and his colleagues at the
University of Michigan have found that their new product, known as
BCTP, safely and effectively destroys a number of the most
dangerous bacteria and viruses. In addition, a second team at
Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, N.M., has produced a
new decontaminating foam that's as nontoxic as hair conditioner.
</P>
<P>
   These two products may revolutionize the way we think about
killing viruses and bacteria and may help to reduce the terror and
the threat of biological warfare, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Modern science has been seeking to produce an agent with
bleach's decontaminating power that could be spread on guns, poured
onto clothes, sprayed into eyes and nostrils, rubbed into wounds
and even consumed.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent meeting of the American Society for Microbiology,
the Michigan researchers announced they had tested such a substance
_ BCTP _ on live animals. Over a four-hour period, the fatty, bland
solution _ which you can drink like a milkshake or rub on your skin
like sunscreen _ killed up to 99.4 percent of anthrax bacteria in a
test tube, the researchers said. That's about the same
effectiveness as concentrated bleach. In addition, Baker and his
colleagues reported that rats fed BCTP actually gained weight.

 &HT;    Hypnosis not recommended for everyone
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The new patient wanted Kathy Platoni to relieve
her irritable bowel pain through hypnosis, so the psychologist did
what she always does when people ask for hypnotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   She looked for reasons not to do it.
</P>
<P>
   She interviewed the patient for full medical and psychological
histories. She found an anxiety disorder that likely was the root
of the abdominal pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had treated the symptom rather than the anxiety that was
causing it, the anxiety would have had to find a new way to
manifest itself,'' Platoni said. Immobilizing panic or heart
palpitations would not be good alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Hypnosis often makes psychological disorders worse, says John
Baren, a clinical social worker who is Platoni's partner and also a
hypnotherapist. Besides complicating psychosis, paranoia and manic
depression, it can uncover painful memories that a post-traumatic
stress patient has repressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Repression's not all bad,'' Baren says. ``It can be very
healthy. Hypnosis in a sense is psycho-surgery with words. If
you're going to open these things up, you better know what you're
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hypnosis is a virtually unregulated field, to the dismay of
Platoni, Baren and the American Society of Clinical Hypnosis in
suburban Chicago, one of two national credentialing organizations
that require advanced training in behavioral health. The other is
the Society for Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis in Pullman,
Wash. For chronic pain treatment, Baren recommends looking for
membership in the American Pain Society or the American Academy of
Pain Management.

 &HT;    Today's hypnosis not like Hollywood's version
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The first time someone urged Dee Bucher to
undergo hypnosis for her chronic pain, she says, the psychologist
``seemed like such a nice lady, I didn't want to laugh in her
face.''
</P>
<P>
   For three years, she had suffered relentlessly because of
damaged muscles and nerves from her lower back to her neck. She was
a store detective in 1989 when she caught a shoplifter who threw
her up against a stone wall. Since then, she had seen more doctors
and tried more medications than she could count.
</P>
<P>
   Now she was spending 30 days at the Pain Center in Miami Valley
Hospital. And this cheery stranger was going to make her feel
better by telling her she felt verrry sleepy? ``I know I had a
little smirk on my face,'' Bucher says.
</P>
<P>
   But Kathy Platoni was persistent. A few days later, the
hypnotherapist visited Bucher soon after she lost a job for being
unable to work. After working 22 years at the security job she
loved, Bucher says, ``I was just devastated.''
</P>
<P>
   As she lay down on her hospital bed, Bucher ``just kept thinking
`She's going to pull a watch out any minute and wave it in front of
my eyes.' '' But she was about to learn how little resemblance
there was between the glinty-eyed hypnotists of Hollywood and the
medical hypnotherapists with advanced training in psychology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next thing I knew, it was the deepest relaxation I have
ever felt,'' Bucher says. She still knew what was going on around
her, but she felt a therapeutic inner peace as Platoni ``just took
me back to pleasant thoughts of different things. I was just
absolutely amazed.''
</P>
<P>
   More than six years later, Bucher has made a habit of
hypnotizing herself at home whenever she feels those periodic
episodes of agony that take her breath away. Platoni still helps
her into a trance once or twice a month at her regular therapy
sessions for the depression that accompanies her chronic pain.
</P>
<P>
   Done properly by a behavioral health professional, hypnosis has
proven to be so safe and effective for chronic pain treatment that
even the orthodox Journal of the American Medical Association has
endorsed it. About 85 percent of the population is sufficiently
susceptible to hypnosis to benefit from it, says Platoni. Hypnotic
trances not only can divert people's minds from their pain, but
also trigger physiological responses that actually blunt the pain.
</P>
<P>
   JAMA also approves hypnosis for treating insomnia, and it has
some success in behavior modification and treating psychological
disorders. But it works best for pain because ``pain is an
extraordinary motivator,'' says John Baren, Platoni's psychology
practice partner in Centerville and a clinical social worker who
has treated patients with hypnosis for more than 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Baren has guided Platoni through surgical procedures in which
hypnosis was her only anesthesia. Her trance was so deep during
full facial laser surgery a few weeks ago that the procedure was
more extensive than usual and she needed no painkilling medications
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Pain is a constant companion for Bucher that makes it hard for
her to bend or stretch, sit or stand. But as migraines and muscle
spasms come and go, the pain varies in intensity. Hypnosis gets her
through those excruciating 20 minutes it takes for her medications
to kick in, and it helps her tolerate the normal pain without so
many painkilling and muscle-relaxing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to live my life as a zombie,'' says Bucher, who
is on full disability at age 45.
</P>
<P>
   Hypnosis is only an adjunct to the medication for chronic pain,
says Platoni, just as it should only be used with psychotherapy to
treat anxiety, panic, addictive and post-traumatic stress
disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, she and Baren have used hypnotherapy to treat
chronic pain from industrial accidents, migraines, irritable
bowels, burns, multiple sclerosis, cancer, fibromyalgia, facial
neuralgia and back or neck injuries. They have used it before and
after surgery, where research shows it can help lower the blood
pressure and heart rate to reduce blood loss, and enhance breathing
to increase oxygen levels.
</P>
<P>
   Platoni compares hypnosis to the focused concentration of a
person so engrossed in reading a book that the car chase on
television or the bickering children underfoot aren't even
distracting. The deeper the focused trance, the more easily a
hypnotic suggestion can become engraved in a person's subconscious.
</P>
<P>
   She can't eliminate the pain because she can't remove its cause,
but she can help a patient change the sensation to something more
tolerable. She can urge a patient to perceive a searing, burning
pain as a warming, pulsating feeling. Or to feel throbbing as
pulling or tugging instead.
</P>
<P>
   But even self-hypnosis can alleviate the anxiety and tension
that Platoni says ``makes pain more severe than it has to be.''
Bucher calms herself by going into her dark and quiet bedroom,
lying down and focusing on one pleasant thing. It might be the
memory of a friend she hasn't seen for a while, or moments and
conversations she remembers with her grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I try to relive that,'' she says. ``It's a distraction
from the pain. The pain doesn't go away. But when you're in a lot
of discomfort, you'll do just about anything to bring it down even
a little bit at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   The image has to be specific, she says. It's not enough just to
picture a loved one's face. Once with Platoni's help, Bucher
experienced herself as a child with her father. ``And I could smell
my dad's cologne, it was so vivid.''
</P>
<P>
   More than distracting someone from pain, Platoni says the
pleasant focus actually competes with the pain, occupying nerve
centers of the brain so pain signals can't reach them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you drop a hammer on your toe, your toe doesn't know that
hurts,'' Baren says. The toe has to send a signal to the brain
saying what happened, and the brain sends the pain signal back in
response. Hypnosis, anesthesia and other drugs reduce the number of
signals.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Baren says, the deep relaxation of a hypnotic
trance increases the levels of endorphins and enkephalins, natural
painkillers the body produces itself. ``Hypnosis doesn't just alter
your state of consciousness, it also alters the production of these
neurochemicals.''
</P>
<P>
   Even simple relaxation diminishes pain, Bucher and the
therapists believe, by breaking the cycle in which pain creates
tension, which amplifies pain. Platoni says stress is especially
instrumental in chronic pain because those patients naturally fear
their ebbing and flowing agony, their incapacity from working,
their inability to have fun.
</P>
<P>
   Bucher has focused so deeply a few times with Platoni, her mind
so thoroughly committed to one track, that she felt like she was
somewhere else watching the two of them. She had completely
``dissociated,'' in Platoni's word, something fewer than 10 percent
of people are capable of doing.
</P>
<P>
   Dissociating to some degree is the goal of all hypnosis, Baren
says. ``You take yourself away from the event at hand. When people
studied POWs who survived torture, they found out they were the
ones who had learned to dissociate.

 &HT;    Ever have one of those days ...
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ The day was off to a bad start. Barely five
minutes out of bed and I had already poured the juice of two
freshly squeezed oranges down the sink and dumped a handful of
vitamins into the trash. My morning routine was running amok. Then
the cat went fishing in my bowl of shredded wheat.
</P>
<P>
   Things would get better, I assured myself as I wheeled into the
middle school parking lot. No room for sloppy work here. Moments
later I was turning the corner into the teacher's lounge when the
science teacher zipped past me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outta' my way!'' she warned. ``Too much coffee and too long a
drive.'' She swept into the restroom with a sigh of impending
relief but the door had barely slammed behind her when she was out
again, wearing a puzzled frown and grappling with her skirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a kid on the teacher's toilet,'' she gasped. I asked
her who it was. ``Joey. He's just sitting there grinning, with his
jeans around his ankles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' I agreed, ``Joey never was much of a talker.'' The
science teacher split for another facility. I punched some numbers
into the copy machine and planned what I was going to say to Joey
when he emerged. I needn't have bothered. He never came out.
</P>
<P>
   Second period I checked, but he was gone. And then the fire bell
rang.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of it being my conference period, and no matter it was
just another drill (schoolhouses don't burn down much any more), I
had to hustle to collect my grade book and get outside before the
big guy with the stopwatch declared me
</P>
<P>
   in violation of something or other. On the way out I tripped
over Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you doing in that corner?'' I asked. ``The school
might be on fire and you'd be trapped.'' Martin said that was
better than the alternative. As I hustled him down the hall, he
explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joey's going to kill me. He told me so on the bus.'' By way of
conversation as we rushed down the stairs and past the scowling man
with the stopwatch, I asked him why. ``I told him Hornsby was
ugly,'' he confessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joey has a brother named Hornsby?'' I asked with an
ill-concealed chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naw,'' Martin grumped, ``Hornsby's his dog.''
</P>
<P>
   I explained to Joey that guys were more sensitive about their
dogs than they were about their sisters, so if he wanted to live
until Christmas, he'd better apologize. He agreed.
</P>
<P>
   By seventh period, the day was looking up until I spotted a
sixth-grader scrunched down in the doorway next to his classroom. I
stopped and stared. This rosy-cheeked cherub had apparently
stumbled into a wealth of reinforcement rings for loose-leaf
notebook paper. A linen circle was pasted on each earlobe, one on
the end of his nose, three across his mouth, and a few more stuck
to his chin in a makeshift goatee. He saw me staring and peeled in
a hurry. Don't ask, I told myself.
</P>
<P>
   And my day wasn't over yet.
</P>
<P>
   After the last bell, I wistfully climbed into my battered old
Bronco for our last run. It was trade-in day and I was feeling a
mite sentimental as I pulled into the car dealer's. ``Hi,'' I said
to the man in the third cubicle from the door _ the one where I'd
made the deal for a new car. ``I'm here to pick up my Explorer.''
He just stared. ``The black one,'' I added by way of pointless
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   He looked a little puzzled, even after I asked to speak with
Tom. All he said was, ``Tom who?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom Watkins,'' I answered a little annoyed with his
foolishness. The guy grinned and told me they'd fired Tom the day
before. I told him that was impossible since Tom was the owner's
son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ma'am,'' he said finally and with a chuckle, ``there's nothing
I'd love better than to sell you a new truck, but this is the Chevy
dealership.'' I swore the wiseguy to secrecy and climbed back into
my Bronco for a short ride down the road to the Ford place, happy
this day was almost over.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning as I apprehensively slipped into my faculty
parking spot not knowing what this day was going to bring, I
spotted Joey waiting for me. ``Ms. Schuett, can we work a deal?''
he asked hopefully. ``I promise not to kill Martin if you won't
tell I was in the teacher's bathroom. I just couldn't wait. I had
to go right then.''
</P>
<P>
   I agreed and we shook on it. Things are looking up for today.

 &HT;    He won't resign, so Congress will take what it can, by the pound
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Richard Nixon resigned before giving us a chance
to see what it was like for a full House to consider articles of
impeachment. So we can only speculate on what would have been.
</P>
<P>
   But, ladies and gents, there'll be no speculation this time.
Bill Clinton is about to slide, gym shorts first, down a mile-long
razor blade into a barrel of turpentine. Cowabunga, dudes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton isn't going to resign. The Senate isn't going to have
the two-thirds majority to remove him. What we have before us is
everything in between: a ritual bloodletting, which early healers
asserted would make a body feel better.
</P>
<P>
   Of flesh are Bill Clinton's sins, and so will be his remittance,
in pounds.
</P>
<P>
   What we have lined up is an old military-school paddle whack,
only with meat mallets.
</P>
<P>
   We can dispense with comparisons. Watergate? This doesn't
compare:
</P>
<P>
   _ In Clinton's case we are arguing the definition of sex. In
Watergate, no one was arguing the definition of burglary.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Watergate, special prosecutor Leon Jaworski produced a set
of findings and stepped out of the way to let others decide.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Kenneth Starr ``produced'' a set of findings. You
bet, he produced. He sang. He danced. He conducted the Hallelujah
Chorus. He tugged at ropes and pulleys as trumpeting angels danced
across the backdrop. Starr's production caused ex-Watergate
investigator Sam Dash to resign in disgust from his team.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Constitution sets forth ``high crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   The Starr investigation has uncovered low crimes and Miss
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Watergate the question was: ``What did he know and when did
he know it?''
</P>
<P>
   In this scandal the question is: ``He did WHAT?''
</P>
<P>
   _ Watergate inspired young people by the hundreds of thousands
to become journalists. The Clinton scandal has caused journalists
by the hundreds of thousands to consider finding another craft.
</P>
<P>
   _ During Watergate, Americans sat glued to their television sets
watching the proceedings. Americans are glued to their television
sets this time as well, just not to the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Watergate, leaders in the House approached their task with
hushed solemnity and a sense of history.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the tribunal is less than hushed. Listen and
you'll hear that impeachment is something you can do any old time.
</P>
<P>
   In comments roundly criticized by others who see the House's
responsibility as far more weighty, House Republican Whip Tom DeLay
said this:
</P>
<P>
   ``All impeachment is, is like a grand jury that looks at the
evidence, and the House decides whether the evidence warrants
sending it to the Senate for a trial. That's all it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Th-th-that's all, folks.
</P>
<P>
   _ A New York Times editorial, counting the votes in the House,
said that Clinton would spare himself a trial in the Senate if he'd
admit he lied under oath. That's probably right.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, one more major difference between this scandal and
Watergate: Would Nixon have saved himself if he admitted, ``I knew
about the burglary. I ordered the cover-up''? Yeah, right.
</P>
<P>
   The Times also is right when it says that Clinton's misdeeds as
alleged ``do not meet the constitutional standard for impeachment.
But politics and human nature enter into this matter as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, they do. And that's why when this chapter is over, and
Clinton, still president, has been cut down several sizes, history
will remember this scandal not as a villainous chief executive who
flouted the law and abused his office, but as a reckless oaf who
gave his enemies a chance to whack him.
</P>
<P>
   And everyone will feel better. Oh, yeah.

 &HT;    Fresh start for Bengals in '99 will depend heavily on '98
rookies
 &HT;    By Chick Ludwig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Mention the 2-12 record and you get cold, hard
stares. Say the word ``future'' and you see a gleam in their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about Bengals rookie starters Takeo Spikes, Brian
Simmons and Artrell Hawkins isn't just their burgeoning talent.
It's their positive attitude.
</P>
<P>
   All three will be leaned on heavily for their leadership skills
as the Bengals seek a turnaround season in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like we're on a train with me and 'B' (Simmons) in
front,'' Spikes said. ``We'll take turns being the engineer. If
you're coming, you better hop on. If you're not, get the hell
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Spikes, a consensus All-American linebacker at Auburn in 1997,
promises fans that the losing will end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to change and it's going to change next year,'' he
said. ``I'm taking all the responsibility. I'm not going to stand
up and say, 'I'm going to be the leader.' I'm going to lead by
example and by my play. You get your respect faster that way. And
then everything else will fall in right behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing I'm going to start with are the little things _
getting in the huddle, getting your mind right, not talking, going
ahead and breaking the huddle and then playing with reckless
abandon.''
</P>
<P>
   Simmons, an All-American at North Carolina, said he's
``definitely'' ready to join Spikes as co-engineer on the
leadership train.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a position where we need to be leaders,'' he said.
``We need to take over that type of role.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins wants to hop on board, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a goal of ours, to establish ourselves as leaders,''
the rookie cornerback from the University of Cincinnati said.
``Right now, it's hard because we're rookies. You need to gain
respect of the older guys and make plays. Right now, we're
learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm doing is going out every week, trying to stay upbeat
and I'm sure those guys (Spikes and Simmons) are, too. I still play
with emotion. I'm going to do my dances. When I make a play, I'm
going to let everybody know I made a play and that's so my
teammates can feed off it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, in the years to come, I'm going to be a leader
here. I want to go to the Pro Bowl. I want to win championships. I
love this city. It's just kind of tough right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong safety Myron Bell, who played his first four seasons in
Pittsburgh, said 30 to 40 Steelers got paid $250 a week to
participate in an offseason program. He said a similar program
would benefit the Bengals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about the money,'' Bell said. ``It's about building
unity. That's something we're missing here. We have young guys, old
guys and in-the-middle guys. You need that extra time to get that
gel together. The main thing is chemistry.'

 &HT;    HEALTH: Baby boomers boost market for anti-aging treatments
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ A half-hour drive west of the flame-throwing
fountains outside Caesar's Palace in this oasis built on fantasy
and hustles, a 60-year-old retired Chicago radiologist with Charles
Atlas shoulders and the zeal of an evangelist is pitching
deliverance.
</P>
<P>
   Not from gluttony or deceit, but from age. For $1,700 a month,
Dr. Alan Mintz says, he can turn back the hands of time _ and get
rid of the spare tire around your belly to boot.
</P>
<P>
   He calls his venture Cenegenics _ Greek for ``new life.'' Less
than a year old, it's one of just a handful of anti-aging clinics
that have popped up around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Though nutrition and exercise make up two of the three prongs of
Cenegenics' treatment, it is human growth hormone, or HGH, that
draws many through the six three-story Greek pillars that mark the
clinic's entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-aging practitioners claim that HGH can have sedentary
septuagenarians hiking over hilltops in two months. It's created
such a buzz that at the sixth conference of the American Academy of
Anti-Aging Medicine (A4M) here last weekend, it was difficult to
find one of the roughly 1,000 doctors in attendance who did not
either use or prescribe HGH.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say it tightens skin, increases libido, improves
cardiovascular capacity and boosts lean muscle mass. Critics say
the benefits are exaggerated and the dangers haven't been fully
documented.
</P>
<P>
   Such questions are common about the growing array of anti-aging
treatments _ from eating raw spinach and drinking oxygenated water
to liposuction and cutting-edge anti-oxidants _ being introduced as
Baby Boomers hit 50. That group is eagerly experimenting with
so-called ``alternative'' medicine: According to a recent study in
the Journal of the American Medical Association, about half of the
country's population between 35 and 49 uses some form of
alternative medicine.
</P>
<P>
   That's because of the perceived stodginess of traditional
medicine, and the public's increased awareness of alternative
treatments. The combination is supporting clinics like Cenegenics.
But few treatments are as controversial as HGH.
</P>
<P>
   Mintz, a competitive bodybuilder for a decade, has been
injecting the drug into his thighs for more than a year. He said it
is as close to the fountain of youth as man has found.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel unbelievably good,'' he said on Thursday. ``I almost
never get sick, I have boundless energy, I exercise every morning,
my sex life is better than it was five years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the claims and the growing use in certain social
circles, not everybody is convinced the drug is safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you'd have to be out of your mind to take that
stuff,'' said Dr. Richard Sprott, executive director of the
Bethesda, Md.-based Ellison Medical Foundation and a former
director of the National Institute on Aging. ``I think they are all
running a much bigger risk then they think they're running.''
</P>
<P>
   Originally extracted from the pituitary glands of corpses to
stimulate the growth of child dwarves, HGH was synthesized for the
first time in 1985 and approved by the FDA for treatment of rare
pituitary disorders in August 1996. But for movie stars in
Hollywood, business executives in Manhattan and anybody else who
can afford the almost $20,000 yearly cost, it is rapidly becoming
the Holy Grail of extended youth.
</P>
<P>
   Mintz claims that Cenegenics has 200 patients in 30 states and
estimates there are 10,000 patients using the drug nationally under
doctor supervision. But, he adds, there are countless others _
mostly bodybuilders _ buying knockoff versions on the black market.
</P>
<P>
   Though Cenegenics is among the only clinics of its kind in the
country, it seems doubtful it will hold that status much longer.
Among more than 200 vendors at the A4M conference, a half-dozen
were successfully selling equipment to enable physicians to test
the ``biomarkers'' of age. Taken together, these machines _ which
assess lung capacity, vision, hearing, strength, reflexes and
mental acuity, among other tests _ pinpoint a person's biological
age compared to his chronological age.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors running anti-aging clinics compare patients' biomarkers
from year to year to gauge the effectiveness of treatments.
</P>
<P>
   And in coming years, anti-aging medicine will revolutionize what
it means to grow old, doctors at the Las Vegas conference
predicted. On Friday, when Dr. Ronald Klatz, the academy's
president, said he would kick himself if he didn't live to be 150,
nobody batted an eye. Among this crowd of decidedly-not-mainstream
Ph.D's and medical doctors, the talk of living to see one's
great-great-great-grandchildren is considered very attainable.
</P>
<P>
   This new wave of technology and enthusiasm couldn't come at a
more profitable time. With 75 million Baby Boomers beginning to
ache with the first twinges of arthritis, the market for wrinkle
cream and its more sophisticated brethren has never been larger or
grown faster.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Tepper, the editor of The Journal of Longevity, estimates
the market of nutritional supplements alone is upwards of $15
billion. Treatises on how to live forever, and look good doing it,
line the bookshelves at neighborhood bookstores. Cosmetic surgeons
who attended the conference talked of month-long waiting lists.
</P>
<P>
   But discerning legitimate therapies from bunk is becoming an
increasingly Herculean task. The academy is trying to broaden the
scope of tools used in the West, but Klatz acknowledges that there
are a lot of false claims being made which potentially undermine
the academy's credibility. He drew a sharp line between the vendors
at the conference and the reports presented by the doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This stuff just pays the bills (for the conference),'' Klatz
said. ``It's one of my great frustration that the two are often
confused.''
</P>
<P>
   Packed into four exhibit halls, the vendors hawked everything
from soda pledging to make you smarter to supplements that promise
to clean out your colon. In between were magnets to relieve pain,
spinal pumps to improve posture, organ detoxifiers,
battery-operated brain stimulators, high-tech air filters, memory
boosters, muscle builders, massagers touted to give you a
two-minute face lift, creams that promise to increase your
bustline, water ionizers, oxygen chambers and high-tech
antioxidants _ including one that may soon be injected into the
filter of cigarettes to reduce the harmful effects of nicotine.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the products have solid scientific research behind them.
Some have none and are being sold, as one conventioneer put it, by
people who sold cars last month and will be selling shoes next
month.
</P>
<P>
   But with its almost bionic claims, HGH was foremost on the minds
of many at the conference. Likened to a master hormone regulating
metabolism, the production of HGH peaks in adults between 25 and
35. Every decade thereafter, the body's output dwindles by about 15
percent. By supplementing one's natural supply, proponents say they
can maintain the hormone levels of a 30-year-old in the body of
80-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Hueseman, a pharmacist from Colorado selling one of the
half-dozen brands on the market to doctors, said despite the cost _
which is not covered by insurance in most cases _ the number of
people taking HGH is projected to double every year for the next 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is exploding,'' Hueseman said. ``And it's not going
to stop any time soon.''
</P>
<P>
   This explosion comes six months before a series of potentially
definitive double-blind tests paid for by the National Institute on
Aging is expected to be released. And that leaves skeptics like
Sprott labeling people who use the drug crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it is a risk? Sure, it's a risk,'' said Julio Garcia, a Las
Vegas plastic surgeon who, at 41, takes a hormone to stimulate HGH
production and plans to take HGH itself in the future. ``But
everything we know about it points to the positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Though membership in the A4M has increased from a mere 12 in
1993 to 4,000 this year, the board is not recognized by the
American Board of Medical Specialties, the government's
organization that regulates specialized medical organizations. The
A4M is viewed by critics as too quick to endorse unproven therapies
like HGH. Klatz chalks up much of the criticism to politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medicine is an awful lot like the church,'' said the bearded
43-year-old. ``There's an orthodoxy and if it ain't part of the
orthodoxy, guess what . . . it's going to be pooh-poohed until it
does start making money for the people on the inside. And then
there is going to be a great discovery by the medical
establishment, and it will be the best thing since sliced bread.''

 &HT;    At Emily's place, Indigo Girl Saliers clears tables, gives
refills and sweeps
 &HT;    By Bo Emerson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DECATUR, Ga. _ You start out as just a Decatur girl with a
guitar, playing for free at a local pub. You work hard, write songs
and rise to become an international star. Your records go
multi-platinum, and your concerts sell out.
</P>
<P>
   Then you can do what you really want to do.
</P>
<P>
   If you're Emily Saliers, what you really want to do is sweep
floors and bus tables.
</P>
<P>
   It's an unusual career arc. Saliers, 35, the redhaired half of
the uber-folkie duo Indigo Girls, usually seen onstage in front of
the waving hands of thousands, has worked her way down to wiping
off counter tops and serving up sandwiches. When her new fans wave,
they want refills.
</P>
<P>
   Customers coming into her restaurant, Watershed, once a gas
station, now a pale-green boutique/eatery on the edge of downtown
Decatur, usually know that Saliers is one of the co-owners. Yet
they are invariably surprised that this star, who takes her own
caterer with her on concert tours, is cleaning up their dirty
dishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is she still here?'' asks technical writer Catherine Mesa, 34,
stopping in for a grilled eggplant sandwich. ``I keep thinking that
she's going to be gone, and she's still here.''
</P>
<P>
   Having Saliers pick up after them is, for some customers, a
disorienting experience. ``My neighbor was really freaked out by
it,'' says Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   Others get a huge kick out of meeting Saliers and are put at
ease by her matter-of-fact manner.
</P>
<P>
   Landscape designer Sylvia Elwyn, 46, is sharing lunch with Mesa
(including pumpkin soup, grilled eggplant and a slice of cranberry
pear buttercake). She gets Saliers to autograph a Watershed-logo
baseball cap for her 16-year-old daughter, Allison. Sylvia and
Allison were in one recent night, and Allison, a major follower of
the Indigos, found herself chatting with an idol. ``It made her
night,'' says Sylvia. ``Allison was in awe.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, Saliers and her three nonfamous co-owners didn't
open Watershed because they love menial labor. But restaurants and
scut work go hand in hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't foresee the amount of work, the amount of time and
the amount of money that would go into it,'' says Saliers, nibbling
a wild mushroom torte during a break. ``But if there's something
that needs to be done, then you just stop everything and do it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been some gawking,'' jokes co-owner Susan Owens. ``But
it hasn't been overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   Even chef Scott Peacock schleps the occasional dish out,
especially if the customer is his mentor, Edna Lewis. (Lewis,
Southern cuisine diva, stops in one sunny afternoon for a glass of
wine and says the place is ``fantastic.'' Peacock quips, ``Your
check will be in the mail.'')
</P>
<P>
   Saliers' main responsibility is keeping the wine bar stocked and
choosing the inventory for the small wine shop in the back of the
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   She has experience in the food business, not all of it positive.
As a 16-year-old waitress at a chain restaurant in a nearby mall,
she was known for spilling food on customers. ``I knew I wasn't cut
out for that line of work,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for her, Watershed doesn't offer table service, so any
such food accidents are the customers' responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Saliers says her dose of hands-on labor has had a mysterious
positive effect on her music. ``Though I have less time to write,
I've got more songs coming out than I have had in years,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Indigo Girls go into the studio in February and will probably be
touring again next summer, says Saliers. But right now she's
enjoying staying in one spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all been a joyful experience for all of us,'' she says.
``I'm not tired of it. I like it here; it's a nice place to hang
out.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also a nice way to get together with her Decatur-based
family. And here they come: parents Don and Jane Saliers and sister
Jennie Saliers (visiting from Baltimore), all stopping in for a
bite this same afternoon. Says the Rev. Don, a theology professor
at Emory University, ``I've seen her more in here than I have in
months.''
</P>
<P>
   Emily gives her parents a big hello, but reserves most of her
attention for 6-month-old nephew Bryson Levisay, who gets danced
around the room, and fed a custom-concocted lunch. ``This is
organic puree of gruel,'' says Emily.
</P>
<P>
   Bryson doesn't have much to say, but judging from his gummy
smile, this customer is going to leave a big tip.

 &HT;    Writer maintains a devoted following with visions of a chaotic
21st century
 &HT;    By Patrick Beach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ He's the leading cyberpunk science fiction
author going, with eight novels and two story collections. He's
just published a ninth novel that, although set almost 50 years in
the future, can be read as contemporary political satire. He cranks
out bomb-throwing futuristic essays at an alarming pace and
distributes them via e-mail. And just now Austin author Bruce
Sterling has a real problem:
</P>
<P>
   ``No bacon? Fraud! Scandal!''
</P>
<P>
   In the new millennium, maybe Julio's _ the Hyde Park joint with
the best chicken taco plate in town _ will never run short of
genetically enhanced pork products. But it's practically noon, and
they're out, even for a regular like Sterling, who gets greeted by
name.
</P>
<P>
   And so the Futurist of Just South of Hyde Park Proper agrees on
a side of rice as a sad substitute, shoves a fork in his migas and
opens the gate on a conversational bull-ride. He talks about his
career as a science fiction novelist of considerable renown. About
his work for Wired magazine. About his futurist guru status. And
what's up with this weird weather?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very interested in greenhouse issues _ I was radicalized
by the summer's bad weather,'' he says. ``We shouldn't be sitting
here in shorts and sandals in December. This is freakish. There's
no place to hide from CO2. Everybody's under the same sky. This is
a stupid problem to have, like marinating in your own trash.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time this child of the Texas oil industry
has gone on record about global warming. The post-greenhouse world
provided the setting for ``Heavy Weather,'' his 1994 work that beat
the pants off ``Twister.'' And his new novel _ ``Distraction,'' _
has the Dutch throwing an international hissy fit just because the
rising sea is making their country disappear. (In the book,
greenhouse typhoons have already done a major number on portions of
Louisiana. Fortunately, the populace there has a Huey Long-style
governor for diversion.)
</P>
<P>
   Sterling cracks that the novel is as ``humiliating as today's
headlines,'' and, since it's got sex, power, corruption and
governmental disarray, it could hardly be more timely.
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't picked up a science fiction novel in the past 15
years, Sterling's insistence on extrapolating contemporary concerns
and spinning futuristic novels out of them may not be your idea of
science fiction. Your idea of science fiction may be retrograde
space opera stuff where swashbuckling male pilots colonize galaxies
of planets full of busty alien women in stainless steel brassieres.
You may still labor under the delusion that science fiction fans
are exclusively adolescent boys who read the cheap novels _ comic
books without pictures, really _ while eating fish sticks, drinking
Tang and absent-mindedly popping their zits. And if that's what you
think, you've missed a lot.
</P>
<P>
   You missed ``Neuromancer,'' William Gibson's 1984 eponymous
novel that's widely credited with popularizing the sci-fi aesthetic
Gibson dubbed ``cyberpunk,'' with its famous opening sentence:
``The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a
dead channel.'' Cyberpunk combined technical savvy with an antic
rock 'n' roll energy and ditched rocket ships and phasers for
computers, artificial intelligence, biotech, nanotech and the Net.
In this world, virtual reality was often preferable to the
old-fashioned kind (though fraught with its own peculiar hazards),
and aliens were rendered irrelevant: Human characters in cyberpunk
were often surgically enhanced and genetically tweaked to the point
where they looked way weirder than little green men.
</P>
<P>
   A few years earlier, after graduating from the University of
Texas, Sterling was reading and writing science fiction for fun _
and getting published _ while working a day job at the Texas State
Capitol. He saved up enough to take a year off to write and never
looked back.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Gibson and Sterling, whose earliest work had predated
Gibson's by seven years, emerged as the brightest lights of this
purported movement. They even collaborated on a novel, ``The
Difference Engine.'' But a marked contrast emerged between the two:
Gibson was stylistically dazzling, but there wasn't all that much
under the hood, while Sterling's works had more meat on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I discovered him and discovered he took his science fiction a
lot more seriously, as speculative fiction, and there were a lot
more and deeper ideas than most authors care to grapple with,''
says Chris Waltrip, a local fan who maintains a Sterling Web site
(http://lonestar.texas.net/(tilde)dub/newfront.html). ``I was
really into cyberpunk when I got into him. Most people get into
Gibson first _ real flashy and glittery. Sterling is the opposite.
He's not flashy, but there's more to chew on.''
</P>
<P>
   True. In person, in book form and through his e-mail essays,
turbocharged ideas pour out of Sterling. But he claims that, at 44,
he's actually slowing down. This is slowing down?
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely, man,'' he says. ``There's gonna be the Sterling
version of the grave, too. I can't get any smarter. And I can feel
that already. I can feel things starting to slip just a little. I
have a harder time with names. Dates I've always had a hard time
with, but now I'm catastrophic at them. I get up every morning
feeling the way I did when I was 20 and I was on a bender the night
before: 'What is this? What have I done? Oh, I'm 40. I get it.' And
that's just a metabolic truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Resigned to not getting smarter, Sterling is cultivating better
taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to be interested in things just because of how trashy
they were _ cool and punk and trashy,'' he says. ``Now I read
design magazines and fuss about architectural doctrine. I've lost
my fondness for trashy things. I've even lost my fondness for
postmodernity. I don't want to start out the 21st century on the
bones of the 20th century because you know what? The 20th century
stinks. It just plain does. It stinks so bad that now the whole sky
stinks. I'm sick of going out on my porch and smelling Mexico on
fire. What the hell is that about? We're doing something wrong
here. We need to take some responsibility of the shape of the world
here. We need clean power. Every time I boot up my computer or send
somebody some e-mail, there's an evil little gush of soot
somewhere. I'm sick of that. I've had it with that. It gives me a
sense of moral and aesthetic revulsion.''
</P>
<P>
   And what does he do about the problem? ``Just sit in an office
moving my fingers up and down.''
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly. Sterling has numerous vents for his passionate
opinions. And he has a ravenous intellect to feed. He subscribes to
dozens of magazines and turns news into science-fiction fodder.
Today in his laptop bag he's got a big double issue of Science,
National Defense Weekly, the galleys of a friend's book and
something called the Global Business Network's ``Guide to the
Millennium Bug.'' ``This is the stuff I really like, stuff that's
printed out on a laser printer and held together with a staple,''
Sterling says. ``This is the stuff. This is it here.''
</P>
<P>
   People always ask authors of speculative fiction where their
wild ideas come from. Sterling's standard answer is they come from
his mailbox.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling also keeps a hand in nonfiction, applying the
journalism degree he earned at the University of Texas 20 years
ago. His 1990 book, ``The Hacker Crackdown: Law and Disorder on the
Electronic Frontier,'' was one of the first and still the best
examinations of the subject. And he's become an occasional
correspondent for Wired magazine, turning up everywhere from
Phoenix to Paris to the Burning Man festival in the Nevada desert.
``So what do you do for a living, Mr. Sterling?'' he's invariably
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I write science fiction novels.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, what are you doing (BEGIN ITAL)here(END ITAL)?''
</P>
<P>
   ``My niche,'' he says, ``is to have my hand in a lot of
things.''
</P>
<P>
   The chronic gripe of genre authors _ even best-selling ones such
as Sterling _ is that they're viewed as being on the other side of
the literary tracks, but this futurist claims ``scarily large
acceptance'' from readers other than ``your basic culture-swapping
pomo hipster types.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always running into guys who come up and profess they're
big fans of mine and they're multimillionaires _ they're
Dellionaires or Microserfs, the digerati, rich, influential, crazy
SOBs who read science fiction. I have plenty of influence. It
frightens me in a lot of ways. I'm not that eager for more.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he's seen the what-goes-up-must-come-down celebrity
curse that attaches itself to most mainstream successes.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me writing is a contest about how good I can get before I
die,'' he says. ``It's not about being the most famous or the most
rich or the best-known or the most influential or the most
universally read. It's about being as Sterlingian as possible
before you're mulch.''
</P>
<P>
   As it is, Sterling can hang out at Julio's and walk around the
neighborhood looking like a UT professor or professional student
without getting accosted. He enjoys hefty sales _ there are about a
quarter of a million copies of his best-selling book, 1988's
``Islands in the Net.'' But he can walk anywhere, in fact, except
science fiction conventions. And sometimes he can even get away
with it there. He can hang out in the house he built _ not on 37th
Street, but close enough that at Christmas time he feels little
pressure to keep up with the holiday lights excess for which that
street is famous. He can Web surf, churn out essays and books and
hang out with his wife and two daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Real futurists have children,'' he says. ``I believe that.''

</P>
<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN-SCHIPPERS _ In his summation of the case against
President Clinton, David Schippers, prosecuting attorney for the
Republican majority, hit just the right note to end the Judiciary
Committee's impeachment hearings and cap the six years' pursuit of
the president that had led to them: Sour. Rank. (Teepen, Cox News

<P>
   EDS: The following column originally moved Thursday and is
moving again for those who used the suggested substitute above.
</P>
<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN-STOPS _ The U.S. Supreme Court justices in a
recent ruling seemed shocked, shocked that Iowa police had got it
into their heads they could search any drivers and cars they pulled
over for routine traffic violations. But the court needed only to
look at its own rulings in recent years to see where the idea came
from that privacy claims have little standing against the claims of
law enforcement convenience.
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery,
according to Great Britain's Jewish Chronicle newspaper of Dec. 11,
sought to have the Jews striving for a national homeland in 1946
``completely and utterly'' defeated in that effort. He's branded as
an anti-Semite, another chapter in the ongoing, often skewy WWII
revisionism. (Howard Kleinberg is a columnist for Cox News

   DELTA-DONATIONS _ There was an old ad campaign, ``It Takes A
Tough Man to Make a Tender Chicken.'' By the same token , it takes
a resourceful woman to give airline food a good name. Delta Air
Lines flight attendant Susan Powell has done that, persuading the
Atlanta-based carrier to donate left over snacks to food banks. The
airline gives away about 1,000 pounds of food a week. (Scott,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). WITH PHOTO. MOVING IN LIFESTYLE AND

   SIBLEY-COLUMN _ ATLANTA _ It never occurred to me to be
sensitive about my tradition of tacky Christmas trees. A misshapen
pine or cedar from the woods was as dear to my heart as the finest,
most symmetrical spruce imported from New England and sold at great
price. And I scorned electric lights and storebought ornaments.
This to the consternation of the children in the family who love
bubbly, on-and-off lights and a lot of sprayed-on snow. This year I
have been vindicated. (Sibley, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   HYPNOSIS _ Done properly by a behavioral health professional,
hypnosis has proven to be so safe and effective for chronic pain
treatment that even the orthodox Journal of the American Medical
Association has endorsed it. Hypnotic trances not only can divert
people's minds from their pain, but also trigger physiological
responses that actually blunt the pain. (Lamb, Dayton Daily News)

   BATTLE-BULGE-SURVIVORS _ George Fisher and friends set off for
college in 1943 and wound up in combat at the Battle of the Bulge,
one of the fiercest of the war. They were promised commissions but
got rifles and private's stripes instead. Each survived the war,
but not unscathed. George was dropped by shrapnel, Larry by machine
gun bullets and Leon by hepatitis. They came home with a powerful
bond and painful memories that kept them from talking about the war
for nearly a half century. But since a reunion 10 years ago,
they've been talking not only among themselves but to their
friends, their families and total strangers. They all feel a sense
of urgency in telling the stories of their war before the last of
them falls silent. The battle started on Dec. 16. (Kalajian Palm

   LIVINGLONGER _ LAS VEGAS _ A half hour west of the
flame-throwing fountains of Caesar's Palace in this oasis built on
fantansy and hustles, a 60-year-old retired Chicago radiologist
with Charles Atlas shoulders and the zeal of a true believer is
pitching deliverance. Not from sin or deceit, but from age. For

   SALIERS _ DECATUR, Ga. _ Emily Saliers, who could afford to have

   STERLING _ AUSTIN, Texas _ He's the leading cyberpunk science
fiction author going, with eight novels and two story collections.
He's just published a ninth novel that, although set almost 50

Schnitzler's turn-of-the-century play ``Reigen'' (more commonly
called ``La Ronde'') is, like the original, all about sex. But most
of the buzz has centered on the performance of film star Nicole
Kidman in her major theatrical debut. By ROBERT HURWITT.
</P>
<P>
   THEATER-REVIEW-TOWN (New York) _ ``On the Town,'' the
invigoratingly nostalgic George C. Wolfe revival of Leonard
Bernstein's famed first musical, at the Gershwin Theatre, swings
with the infectious energy of jazz in the early '40s. ``Side Man,''
Warren Leight's poignant drama at the Golden Theatre, traces the
private lives of increasingly marginalized jazz players in the
1960s and '70s with the mournful notes of a prolonged trumpet solo.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While no longer a member of Congress, as the
Republican presidential candidate in 1996 I do have more than a
passing interest in the pending impeachment proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Without rehashing that election, suffice it to say that any
chance of success I may have had was wiped out by an avalanche of
negative television advertising paid for with money raised through
questionable fund-raising tactics by the president and vice
president. Attorney General Janet Reno has buried her head in the
sand on this serious matter, but let's hope that someone in
Congress will hold the attorney general accountable and pursue the
alleged illegal fund-raising activities.
</P>
<P>
   Having said that, let me lay out what might be an imperfect but
tough and reasonable solution to the pending impeachment matter.
</P>
<P>
   I have reminded myself that to impeach or accuse is the
constitutional responsibility of the House; to convict or acquit is
the constitutional responsibility of the Senate. I seriously doubt
that half the American people understand the complex impeachment
process.
</P>
<P>
   Let me also note, at the outset, that many large and small
details would have to be worked out by congressional leaders
working with the House and Senate parliamentarians and legal
counsels. I've been there and know how much work putting all this
together will entail, including all the procedural hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   So, here goes:
</P>
<P>
   Step No. 1: Vote in the House of Representatives on any or all
of the four articles of impeachment reported by the House Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Step No. 2: Regardless of the outcome of the House vote on any
of the four articles, the Senate majority leader would, at the
earliest possible time, introduce in the Senate a joint resolution
(numbered 1600 if possible). The resolution would contain the
essence or ``guts'' of all articles of impeachment considered by
the House, plus any other necessary language, as determined by the
Senate majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Step No. 3: After suspending or amending the rules governing
impeachment proceedings, the Senate would take up and consider the
joint resolution under a time agreement. The vice president
(president of the Senate) would preside at all times. No amendments
except technical amendments offered by the majority leader would be
in order. All points of order would be waived.
</P>
<P>
   Step No. 4: Upon final action by the Senate, the House of
Representatives would take up the joint resolution: no amendments
in order, except technical amendments offered by the Speaker or his
designee. Points of order would be waived. The resolution would be
considered under a time agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Step No. 5: If a House-Senate conference is necessary, the
conference report would be considered under a time agreement in
both the House and the Senate. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Conditions, Etc. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. The president announces his intention to support and sign the
joint resolution before any action on the resolution by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   a. The president agrees to sign the joint resolution at a public
signing ceremony attended by the vice president, congressional
leadership and other appropriate members of the House and Senate
recommended by Democratic and Republican leaders; the president's
Cabinet; the chief justice of the Supreme Court, and others as
recommended by House and Senate leaders.
</P>
<P>
   b. White House, Senate and House media _ television, radio,
print and photographers _ shall be present.
</P>
<P>
   c. The site, date and hour of the ceremony is to be determined
by the House Speaker, or his designee, and the Senate majority
leader.
</P>
<P>
   d. Copies of the signed joint resolution, with an appropriate
presidential letter, are to be forwarded to members of the Cabinet,
members of Congress and heads of other government agencies. This is
to be completed within seven days of signing the joint resolution.
</P>
<P>
   2. The overall agreement is to be determined by the Speaker, or
his designee, and the Senate majority leader. Possible items:
</P>
<P>
   a. All congressional action completed and the president's
signature affixed on or by Jan. 2, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   b. Bipartisan. Any agreement in the House or Senate with
reference to the proceedings shall be inoperative if the president,
vice president and Democratic congressional leaders fail to
publicly and actively support the joint resolution. Support is to
be demonstrated by the president, vice president and Democratic
leadership in House and Senate, prior to and throughout
consideration of the joint resolution. Republican leaders also
agree to publicly and actively support it.
</P>
<P>
   c. The Speaker, or his designee, and the majority leader shall
outline procedure, rules, time and any and all other matters
pertaining to debate and disposition of the joint resolution, and
could, if appropriate, include provisions relating to the
president's legal obligations upon leaving office.
</P>
<P>
   3. Penalties. Any penalty imposed must be in accordance with the
Constitution and could require the voluntary agreement by the
President to overcome the prohibition against bills of attainder. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Summary &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These are my ideas. They are offered in good faith. I have
consulted with no one.
</P>
<P>
   They may not be worthy of a second thought, but I believe the
suggestions could lead to a fairly broad bipartisan result. There
is scarcely anyone who believes that the required 67 senators would
vote to convict the president on any of the four articles of
impeachment approved by the House Judiciary Committee,
notwithstanding what the full House might do.
</P>
<P>
   I hope these suggestions will be seen as a blending of
responsibility and justice, which will permit an expeditious
disposition of the entire matter before the new 106th Congress
begins work in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   It is also my hope that pursuing the above suggested outline, or
a modified version thereof, would demonstrate to the vast majority
of Americans that Republican congressional leaders will fulfill
their constitutional responsibilities, clear the decks and move
forward when the 106th Congress convenes on Jan. 6, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   I cannot imagine a better way for Republicans to start the new
year than by taking charge, and producing just results, at this
historic moment. It is time for a tough but responsible conclusion.
Maybe these ideas will be a starting point for a bipartisan ending.

 &HT;    The not-so-funny side of Bob Hope
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bob Hope made generations of Americans laugh, but the comedian's
private life has not always been so funny. In a superb profile in
The New Yorker ($3), John Lahr describes Hope as a driven man who
became one of the most recognized entertainers in the world but
remained a stranger to his family. ``I don't feel that I really
know him,'' daughter Linda Hope says. And Dolores, Hope's wife of
64 years, accepted his notorious womanizing because, ``I thought I
was better-looking than anybody else.'' As for Hope's career, Woody
Allen tells the magazine that the comedian was a seminal influence
on his own screen performances. He was best in films, Allen says.
On television, ``he was not very good. He was lazy, and nobody
cared.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The fairest of them all: Following the trend of ``sex sells,''
Vanity Fair ($3.95) spotlights supermodel/actress Charlize Theron
on its cover and in a splashy layout inside with Annie Leibovitz
photographs. Theron, who appears in Allen's ``Celebrity,'' will be
seen in four big films: ``Mighty Joe Young,'' ``The Astronaut's
Wife,'' ``The Yards'' and ``The Cider House Rules.'' Elsewhere in
the magazine are well-crafted articles on NBC's Brian Williams and
Whitewater indictee Susan McDougal, and a delightful, gossipy essay
by Dominick Dunne on 1960s TV hunk Gardner McKay. Dunne, who
discovered McKay and cast him in ``Adventures in Paradise,'' talks
to the former actor about his life in Hawaii and his debut novel,
``Toyer.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Clinton under fire: Predictably, the big story in the
newsweeklies is the impeachment hearings. Newsweek ($2.95) offers
three opinions on the outcome, from ``impeach and convict'' from
William Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, to ``censure and
move on'' from Newsweek's Jonathan Alter. Former Clinton aide
George Stephanopoulos guesses that the president will agree to
censure and a fine of as much as $4.5 million. One thing he won't
do, Stephanopoulos says, is admit he lied.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. News &AMP; World Report ($2.95) looks at the swing votes and
fence-sitters and suggests that the Senate could vote to dismiss
the trial as soon as it begins and vote for censure instead. A
motion to dismiss requires 51 votes in a Senate with 55
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Time ($2.95) lays out the scenario of a Senate trial and
revisits the 1868 impeachment trial of Andrew Johnson, in which
Kansas Republican Sen. Edmund Ross cast the swing vote to keep
Johnson in office. And, on a lighter note, the magazine picks the
best and worst of the year in arts, sports and entertainment. Not
surprisingly, Tom Hanks and Mark McGwire are among the best, while
the final episode of ``Seinfeld'' makes the ``worst'' list. In
books, Tom Wolfe's ``A Man in Full'' takes the top spot along with
David Remnick's ``King of the World: The Rise of Muhammad Ali'' and
Edward Ball's ``Slaves in the Family.'' The worst book was a
bodice-ripper of a different sort: ``The Starr Report.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Back to Vietnam: Georgia Trend ($2.95) scores a coup this
month with Vince Coppola's compelling profile of Georgia political
activist Charles Searcy. A former publisher of the Athens Observer,
Searcy is now the Vietnam director of the Vietnam Veterans of
America Foundation _ a group that sponsors humanitarian projects in
war-scarred countries. Accompanying Searcy on a visit to Hanoi,
Coppola describes the scene at a school and rehabilitation center
where a 13-year-old Vietnamese girl with cerebral palsy proudly
takes a few halting steps for ``Mr. Chuck.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Quick reads: Entertainment Weekly ($2.99) and People ($2.99)
fuel the publicity for the romantic comedy ``You've Got Mail'' with
cover stories on Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. People's profile of Ryan,
which delves into the actress' estrangement from her mother and
husband Dennis Quaid's drug use, is by far the more substantive.
The Entertainment Weekly article is simply a gossipy,
behind-the-scenes look at the making of the film. . . . P.O.V.
($2.95) offers a handy guide to instant entrepreneurship, and
Michael Finkel's entertaining first-person account of the circus
atmosphere surrounding the million-dollar search for bombing
suspect Eric Robert Rudolph. As one local tells the writer, ``Right
now, I guarantee you, Rudolph is just sitting on top of some
mountain, laughing at all of you fools.''

<P>
   In August, Javier Vildoza, 20, the son of a retired Argentine
navy officer, found on the Internet a photograph of his father and
two others who had taken part in torture and kidnapping during the
military's ``dirty war'' of 1976 to 1983, when, it is estimated,
more than 30,000 people were killed or disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Vildoza's father had been a member of the so-called Task Groups
stationed at the Navy Mechanics School in Buenos Aires (ESMA), a
secret detention center, which was commanded by former Adm. Emilio
Eduardo Massera.
</P>
<P>
   The photograph awakened something that had long bothered the
young man. He bore no physical resemblance to either of the people
he knew as his father and mother.
</P>
<P>
   In the next several days, he found related Web sites that
increased his uneasiness. Members of the Grandmothers of the Plaza
de Mayo _ a group of women who lost their sons, daughters, nieces,
nephews or grandchildren during the junta _ had registered more
than 200 children, kidnapped by the military after being born in
prisons and torture chambers. These babies were given away, often
to military and police couples in the 1970s and '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Among the people they were looking for was one who matched
Vildoza's age and facial features, a child born to a young
political dissident in a torture chamber of the ESMA. It was enough
to convince him to take an usual step.
</P>
<P>
   He went to a federal court in Buenos Aires and said: ``My name
is Javier Gonzalo Vildoza, but it is possible that I am another
person. I want to know who I am. I may be a son of the
`desaparecidos''' _ the people who disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   His history as recounted over several weeks led to the Nov. 26
arrest in Buenos Aires of Massera, now 73, one of whose personal
aides had actually raised Vildoza. The story added stunning new
details to what surely ranks as one of the 20th century's most
unbelievable atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   Massera had been among the many past South American officials
being investigated by Baltazar Garzon, the Spanish judge whose
efforts also resulted in the recent arrest in London of Gen.
Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   In his days of megalomaniacal glory, Massera _ who denied any
knowledge of the kidnapped babies _ called himself Commandant Cero,
or The Supreme. Along with other top military officers, Massera was
pardoned in 1990 by Argentina's President Carlos Menem for deeds in
the ``dirty war;'' that amnesty, however, did not cover any
possible involvement in kidnapping the children of victims.
</P>
<P>
   For more than seven years, the Argentines were subject to
violence imposed by a government that claimed for itself the rights
of God. It took the lives of thousands of people without prior
trial or sentence, refused to divulge the whereabouts of those who
were kidnapped, buried persons of known identity in anonymous
graves and tombs, stole their property and children and gave them
to other parents and other owners.
</P>
<P>
   These facts are widely known and often denounced, but they have
lost none of their unspeakable nature. The more we think about
them, the more reprehensible they become and the more unworthy of
being ranked as part of the human condition.
</P>
<P>
   When Vildoza's parents were kidnapped by Argentine security
forces in 1978 and locked in the ESMA, Cecilia Vinas, his mother,
was seven months pregnant. Nothing more is known about the real
father, Hugo Reynaldo Penino.
</P>
<P>
   At least four months after Raul Alfonsin was elected president,
Cecelia Vinas was still able to contact her parents from a secret
telephone, watched by her guardians, but, it seems, they finally
killed her. She never saw her infant son or knew his fate.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Javier is a young man with curly dark hair who lives with
one of the elder (and real) sons of the Vildoza couple. He has
formed an affectionate relationship with an uncle, the brother of
his real mother, and with 11 cousins living in Mar del Plata. He
has a past he never wanted, an education and a value system that
was acquired not through his parents, but through the possible
murderer of his parents.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most vicious and unforgettable legacies of the past
dictatorship was its almost incredible violence against the sacred
right of identity. Thousands of human beings were suddenly
not-beings, without a place, without a name, without existence and
without destiny.
</P>
<P>
   I closely followed these cruel stories thanks to Victor
Penchaszadeh, chief of the genetic medicine division of the Beth
Israel Medical Center in New York, who has helped the Grandmothers
of the Plaza de Mayo since 1982, when some of them traveled to the
United States to denounce the disappearance of their grandchildren
before the United Nations and the Organization of American States.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, the women didn't know that technology existed to
identify the living grandchildren without a blood analysis _ which
was impossible _ of the parents. Penchaszadeh himself had been
miraculously saved when he was kidnapped in 1976, and lived in
exile after that. He told the grandmothers it was possible to trace
identities through grandparents and other close family members.
</P>
<P>
   Penchaszadeh has kept his ties with the group and presented
scores of papers at international conferences about the kidnapping
of children of the disappeared. Traveling to Buenos Aires four or
five times each year, he has met some of the young people who were
found. Of the many stories he has known closely, another made
recent headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Ximena Vicario was eight months old in February, 1977, when her
parents were apprehended in the offices of the Federal Police,
where they had gone to obtain passports. All three of them vanished
in thin air until, eight years later, the girl was adopted by a
nurse in an orphanage, and this was brought to the attention of the
Grandmothers of the Plaza del Mayo.
</P>
<P>
   There followed a very publicized trial and, even after it was
proved genetically that Ximena was the daughter of Juan Carlos
Vicario and Stella Maris Gallichio _ who were almost surely
assassinated _ the girl refused to live with her real grandparents,
who claimed her custody. It was a long and agonizing battle.
</P>
<P>
   Her false mother forced her, at age 10, to scream before TV
cameras that she would not go to her real relatives. But it had a
fortunate outcome. Ximena came to terms with her true family and
grew up at home; she is now a very bright economics student with a
clear idea of who and what she is.
</P>
<P>
   Penchaszadeh has seen her more than once in the offices of the
grandmothers, right in front of the Market of Buenos Aires, working
on cases very similar to her own.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, in the infinite history of humankind, men imagine a
new way to express their hatred even beyond the limits of death.
The consequences were rarely as cruel as in Argentina between 1976
and 1983. This past is still alive in the womb of the country and,
in spite of the punishment for some of the major culprits,
Argentines haven't been able to grasp its immense evil.

<P>
   In the past year, a handful of Washington business lobbyists
have waged a blistering campaign to persuade the world that
Congress has been engaged in a spasm of sanctions proliferation.
Reliance on unilateral sanctions, these lobbyists warn us, is a
disturbing new epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Their campaign has sparked dozens of news articles and
editorials decrying the ``sanctions frenzy'' and castigating
Congress' ``voracious appetite'' for sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Normally responsible journalists parrot statistics _
conveniently furnished by these business lobbyists _ alleging that
in the last few years the United States has placed anywhere from
one-half to two-thirds of the world's population under the yoke of
economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Even President Clinton jumped on the antisanctions bandwagon,
announcing in 1998 that the United States has gone ``sanctions
happy.''
</P>

   This is sheer nonsense. The statistics peddled by the lobbyists
are grossly inflated and intentionally misleading. Half of the
world is not living under American sanctions _ nowhere near it.
There is no epidemic. Congress has been cautious and circumspect,
passing just a handful of carefully targeted sanctions laws. And
unilateral economic sanctions are by no means new. They have been
vital weapons in America's foreign-policy arsenal for more than 200
years.
</P>
<P>
   I have been and continue to be a friend of American business.
But the distortions spread by this small cabal of lobbyists in the
name of American business are inexcusable.
</P>
<P>
   One statistic is by now conventional wisdom: In just four years
the United States has imposed sanctions 61 times, burdening 2.3
billion people (42 percent of the world). That would be pretty
awful, save for one thing _ it is not true. These figures have been
circulated by the anti-sanctions business group USA Engage, based
on a study by the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM). They
are a fabrication.
</P>
<P>
   At my request, the Congressional Research Service (CRS)
evaluated the NAM claim that from 1993 through 1996, ``61 U.S. laws
and executive actions were enacted authorizing unilateral sanctions
for foreign policy purposes.'' CRS reported that it ``could not
defensibly'' justify the number.
</P>
<P>
   How did NAM come up with 61 sanctions? The study alleges that 20
laws were passed by Congress and 41 were imposed by presidential
action. This is a gross distortion. Nearly three-quarters of the
congressional measures were not sanctions at all but conditions,
limitations or restrictions on U.S. foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   One measure placed conditions on assistance to the Palestine
Liberation Organization. Another barred aid for military or police
training to Haitians involved in drug trafficking or human-rights
abuses. One ``sanction'' blocked assistance to countries knowingly
harboring fugitives wanted by the international war-crimes
tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. Still another
prohibited Defense Department aid to countries supporting
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Are these the measures that NAM and USA Engage want Congress to
curtail? Let's hope not.
</P>
<P>
   But what about those 41 ``sanctions'' imposed by the executive
branch? Five are not unilateral, as NAM charges, but rather
represent U.S. compliance with U.N. Security Council sanctions _
multilateral, by definition. In seven cases, the NAM study counts
the same sanction repeatedly, identifying it each time as a
separate sanction.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the measure declaring Sudan a terrorist state is
counted five times. NAM lists two cases when no sanction was ever
imposed, including a November 1994 executive order that even NAM
concedes in fine print ``did not impose any specific new sanctions
on any countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight cases represent mere restrictions on U.S. foreign aid.
Five are limited bans affecting only military exports to Zaire,
Nigeria, Sudan, Haiti and Angola. Thirteen affect only a specific
foreign company or person _ not an entire country, not an entire
industry, but one specific entity _ for example, banning imports
from the Chinese Qinghai Hide and Garment Factory for its use of
prison slave labor or seizing the assets of individual Colombian
drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   These actions are obviously not what most people think of as
``sanctions.'' They think of broad trade bans affecting whole
countries, entire industries, vast populations or access to large
markets _ not of blocking imports from a single prison factory in
China, seizing the assets of drug barons or halting the sale of
lethal weapons to terrorist states.
</P>
<P>
   The claim that 42 percent of the world's population has been
affected is also bogus. The study lists the entire population of
the former Zaire (now the Congo) as being under U.S. sanction
because the United States barred sales of defense items to the
government. The same goes for China, Nigeria, Mauritania and
Pakistan, where CRS notes that such highly targeted actions ``put
the entire populations of these countries into NAM's calculation,
even though most people ... are not likely to experience
significant impact from or awareness of (the) imposition.''
</P>
<P>
   What is the reality? Between 1993 and 1996, Congress passed and
the president signed a total of five new sanctions laws: the
Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994, the Cuban Liberty and
Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996, the Antiterrorism and Effective
Death Penalty Act of 1996, the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act of 1996 and
the Free Burma Act of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   During the same period, the president imposed just four new
sanctions: declaring Sudan a terrorist state; banning imports of
munitions and ammunition from China; tightening travel-related
restrictions, cash remittance levels and the sending of gift
parcels to Cuba (restrictions that have since been lifted); and
imposing a ban on new contractual agreements or investment in Iran.
Nine new sanctions. That is it.
</P>
<P>
   The allegation of a sanctions epidemic is demonstrably false _ a
myth spread with the intention of misleading Congress, the American
public and the American business community.
</P>
<P>
   What the lobbyists dislike is not the idea of sanctions but the
reason some sanctions are imposed. They tacitly admit that
sanctions work but insist that sanctions are good only if they
defend business interests, not national interests.
</P>
<P>
   According to the lobbyists, the United States should be
hamstrung when a government proliferates weapons of mass
destruction, commits genocide, tortures its people or supports
terrorists. But if that same government floods the American market
with cheap TV sets, America should throw the book at it.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, the business lobbyists cannot say that, so they
attempt to confuse the issue with cooked-up data and claims of an
epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions have always been an American foreign-policy weapon.
Economic sanctions were imposed by the American colonies against
Britain in response to the Stamp and Townsend Acts, in both cases
forcing their repeal. Jefferson and Madison both passionately
advocated economic sanctions, believing not only that they were
legitimate but that they should be America's primary diplomatic
tools.
</P>
<P>
   There are three tools in foreign policy: diplomacy, sanctions
and war. Take away sanctions and how can the United States deal
with terrorists, proliferators and genocidal dictators? Our options
would be empty talk or sending in the Marines.
</P>
<P>
   Without sanctions, the United States would be virtually
powerless to influence events absent war. Sanctions may not be
perfect and they are not always the answer, but they are often the
only weapon.
</P>
<P>
   There should be sanctions on companies and governments that
proliferate nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and countries
that murder women and children and pile them into mass graves.
America should not hesitate for one second to place a cost on these
reprehensible acts and to restrain those few American companies who
would actually conduct business with the perpetrators of such
heinous crimes.
</P>
<P>
   With their antisanctions crusade, the lobbyists are fighting for
business as usual with thugs, tyrants and terrorists. They do not
represent the views of the American people or most American
businesses. They should be ashamed.

   In the past year, a handful of Washington business lobbyists
have waged a blistering campaign to persuade the world that
Congress has been engaged in a spasm of sanctions proliferation.
Reliance on unilateral sanctions, these lobbyists warn us, is a
disturbing new epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Their campaign has sparked dozens of news articles and
editorials decrying the ``sanctions frenzy'' and castigating
Congress' ``voracious appetite'' for sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Normally responsible journalists parrot statistics _
conveniently furnished by these business lobbyists _ alleging that
in the last few years the United States has placed anywhere from
one-half to two-thirds of the world's population under the yoke of
economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Even President Clinton jumped on the antisanctions bandwagon,
announcing in 1998 that the United States has gone ``sanctions
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   This is sheer nonsense. The statistics peddled by the lobbyists
are grossly inflated and intentionally misleading. Half of the

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While no longer a member of Congress, as the
Republican presidential candidate in 1996 I do have more than a
passing interest in the pending impeachment proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Without rehashing that election, suffice it to say that any
chance of success I may have had was wiped out by an avalanche of
negative television advertising paid for with money raised through
questionable fund-raising tactics by the president and vice
president. Attorney General Janet Reno has buried her head in the
sand on this serious matter, but let's hope that someone in
Congress will hold the attorney general accountable and pursue the
alleged illegal fund-raising activities.
</P>
<P>
   Having said that, let me lay out what might be an imperfect but
tough and reasonable solution to the pending impeachment matter.
</P>
<P>
   I have reminded myself that to impeach or accuse is the
constitutional responsibility of the House; to convict or acquit is
the constitutional responsibility of the Senate. I seriously doubt
that half the American people understand the complex impeachment
process.
</P>
<P>
   Let me also note, at the outset, that many large and small
details would have to be worked out by congressional leaders
working with the House and Senate parliamentarians and legal
counsels. I've been there and know how much work putting all this
together will entail, including all the procedural hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   So, here goes:
</P>
<P>
   Step No. 1: Vote in the House of Representatives on any or all
of the four articles of impeachment reported by the House Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Step No. 2: Regardless of the outcome of the House vote on any
of the four articles, the Senate majority leader would, at the
earliest possible time, introduce in the Senate a joint resolution
(numbered 1600 if possible). The resolution would contain the
essence or ``guts'' of all articles of impeachment considered by
the House, plus any other necessary language, as determined by the
Senate majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Step No. 3: After suspending or amending the rules governing
impeachment proceedings, the Senate would take up and consider the
joint resolution under a time agreement. The vice president
(president of the Senate) would preside at all times. No amendments
except technical amendments offered by the majority leader would be
in order. All points of order would be waived.
</P>
<P>
   Step No. 4: Upon final action by the Senate, the House of
Representatives would take up the joint resolution: no amendments
in order, except technical amendments offered by the Speaker or his
designee. Points of order would be waived. The resolution would be
considered under a time agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Step No. 5: If a House-Senate conference is necessary, the
conference report would be considered under a time agreement in
both the House and the Senate. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Conditions, Etc. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. The president announces his intention to support and sign the
joint resolution before any action on the resolution by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   a. The president agrees to sign the joint resolution at a public
signing ceremony attended by the vice president, congressional
leadership and other appropriate members of the House and Senate
recommended by Democratic and Republican leaders; the president's
Cabinet; the chief justice of the Supreme Court, and others as
recommended by House and Senate leaders.
</P>
<P>
   b. White House, Senate and House media _ television, radio,
print and photographers _ shall be present.
</P>
<P>
   c. The site, date and hour of the ceremony is to be determined
by the House Speaker, or his designee, and the Senate majority
leader.
</P>
<P>
   d. Copies of the signed joint resolution, with an appropriate
presidential letter, are to be forwarded to members of the Cabinet,
members of Congress and heads of other government agencies. This is
to be completed within seven days of signing the joint resolution.
</P>
<P>
   2. The overall agreement is to be determined by the Speaker, or
his designee, and the Senate majority leader. Possible items:
</P>
<P>
   a. All congressional action completed and the president's
signature affixed on or by Jan. 2, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   b. Bipartisan. Any agreement in the House or Senate with
reference to the proceedings shall be inoperative if the president,
vice president and Democratic congressional leaders fail to
publicly and actively support the joint resolution. Support is to
be demonstrated by the president, vice president and Democratic
leadership in House and Senate, prior to and throughout
consideration of the joint resolution. Republican leaders also
agree to publicly and actively support it.
</P>
<P>
   c. The Speaker, or his designee, and the majority leader shall
outline procedure, rules, time and any and all other matters
pertaining to debate and disposition of the joint resolution, and
could, if appropriate, include provisions relating to the
president's legal obligations upon leaving office.
</P>
<P>
   3. Penalties. Any penalty imposed must be in accordance with the
Constitution and could require the voluntary agreement by the
President to overcome the prohibition against bills of attainder. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Summary &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These are my ideas. They are offered in good faith. I have
consulted with no one.
</P>
<P>
   They may not be worthy of a second thought, but I believe the
suggestions could lead to a fairly broad bipartisan result. There
is scarcely anyone who believes that the required 67 senators would
vote to convict the president on any of the four articles of
impeachment approved by the House Judiciary Committee,
notwithstanding what the full House might do.
</P>
<P>
   I hope these suggestions will be seen as a blending of
responsibility and justice, which will permit an expeditious
disposition of the entire matter before the new 106th Congress
begins work in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   It is also my hope that pursuing the above suggested outline, or
a modified version thereof, would demonstrate to the vast majority
of Americans that Republican congressional leaders will fulfill
their constitutional responsibilities, clear the decks and move
forward when the 106th Congress convenes on Jan. 6, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   I cannot imagine a better way for Republicans to start the new
year than by taking charge, and producing just results, at this
historic moment. It is time for a tough but responsible conclusion.
Maybe these ideas will be a starting point for a bipartisan ending.
</P>

process.
</P>
<P>
   Let me also note, at the outset, that many large and small
details would have to be worked out by congressional leaders
working with the House and Senate parliamentarians and legal
counsels. I've been there and know how much work putting all this
together will entail, including all the procedural hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   So, here goes:
</P>
<P>
   Step No. 1: Vote in the House of Representatives on any or all
of the four articles of impeachment reported by the House Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Step No. 2: Regardless of the outcome of the House vote on any
of the four articles, the Senate majority leader would, at the
earliest possible time, introduce in the Senate a joint resolution
(numbered 1600 if possible). The resolution would contain the
essence or ``guts'' of all articles of impeachment considered by
the House, plus any other necessary language, as determined by the
Senate majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Step No. 3: After suspending or amending the rules governing
impeachment proceedings, the Senate would take up and consider the
joint resolution under a time agreement. The vice president
(president of the Senate) would preside at all times. No amendments
except technical amendments offered by the majority leader would be
in order. All points of order would be waived.
</P>
<P>
   Step No. 4: Upon final action by the Senate, the House of
Representatives would take up the joint resolution: no amendments
in order, except technical amendments offered by the Speaker or his
designee. Points of order would be waived. The resolution would be
considered under a time agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Step No. 5: If a House-Senate conference is necessary, the
conference report would be considered under a time agreement in
both the House and the Senate. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Conditions, Etc. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. The president announces his intention to support and sign the
joint resolution before any action on the resolution by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   a. The president agrees to sign the joint resolution at a public
signing ceremony attended by the vice president, congressional
leadership and other appropriate members of the House and Senate
recommended by Democratic and Republican leaders; the president's
Cabinet; the chief justice of the Supreme Court, and others as
recommended by House and Senate leaders.
</P>
<P>
   b. White House, Senate and House media _ television, radio,
print and photographers _ shall be present.
</P>
<P>
   c. The site, date and hour of the ceremony is to be determined
by the House Speaker, or his designee, and the Senate majority
leader.
</P>
<P>
   d. Copies of the signed joint resolution, with an appropriate
presidential letter, are to be forwarded to members of the Cabinet,
members of Congress and heads of other government agencies. This is
to be completed within seven days of signing the joint resolution.
</P>
<P>
   2. The overall agreement is to be determined by the Speaker, or
his designee, and the Senate majority leader. Possible items:
</P>
<P>
   a. All congressional action completed and the president's
signature affixed on or by Jan. 2, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   b. Bipartisan. Any agreement in the House or Senate with
reference to the proceedings shall be inoperative if the president,
vice president and Democratic congressional leaders fail to
publicly and actively support the joint resolution. Support is to
be demonstrated by the president, vice president and Democratic
leadership in House and Senate, prior to and throughout
consideration of the joint resolution. Republican leaders also
agree to publicly and actively support it.
</P>
<P>
   c. The Speaker, or his designee, and the majority leader shall
outline procedure, rules, time and any and all other matters
pertaining to debate and disposition of the joint resolution, and
could, if appropriate, include provisions relating to the
president's legal obligations upon leaving office.
</P>
<P>
   3. Penalties. Any penalty imposed must be in accordance with the
Constitution and could require the voluntary agreement by the
President to overcome the prohibition against bills of attainder. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Summary &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These are my ideas. They are offered in good faith. I have
consulted with no one.
</P>
<P>
   They may not be worthy of a second thought, but I believe the
suggestions could lead to a fairly broad bipartisan result. There
is scarcely anyone who believes that the required 67 senators would
vote to convict the president on any of the four articles of
impeachment approved by the House Judiciary Committee,
notwithstanding what the full House might do.
</P>
<P>
   I hope these suggestions will be seen as a blending of
responsibility and justice, which will permit an expeditious
disposition of the entire matter before the new 106th Congress
begins work in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   It is also my hope that pursuing the above suggested outline, or
a modified version thereof, would demonstrate to the vast majority
of Americans that Republican congressional leaders will fulfill
their constitutional responsibilities, clear the decks and move
forward when the 106th Congress convenes on Jan. 6, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   I cannot imagine a better way for Republicans to start the new
year than by taking charge, and producing just results, at this
historic moment. It is time for a tough but responsible conclusion.
Maybe these ideas will be a starting point for a bipartisan ending.
</P>

<P>
   It is important for the international community to sort out the
developments in Russia, for our present financial crisis is the
best proof that the Russian economy is integrated into the world
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Our potential partners in the West cannot grasp the logic of
Russia's leaders' economic and political decision making. And yes,
the main problem that faces the West in trying to figure out
Russian events is not so much their complexity as the country's
unpredictability.
</P>
<P>
   I have tried to explain to your politicians, CEOs and other
decision makers that it is probably premature to look for a logical
pattern now.
</P>
<P>
   The fact remains: our new Russian government under Prime
Minister Primakov still has not drawn up an economic policy. But
why? _ It has been too busy trying to ensure political stability.
And in fact it has managed to cope with this major task and keep
things from spiraling out of control. So we put up with a tradeoff:
uncertainty in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that Russia may well take a step backward in terms
of market reforms. What is important is WHY it will make this step.
I hope the outcome will be to make two steps forward afterward.
</P>
<P>
   As to checks and balances, the degree to which our economic
program is realistic depends on whether it can get support from
international financial organizations such as the IMF and World
Bank _ and on whether it succeeds in restructuring our foreign
debts.
</P>
<P>
   Three options are still possible to really overcome the Russian
crisis, but they are all related to the degree to which the budget
is balanced.
</P>
<P>
   _ Option One: To return to a rigid budget with revenues
exceeding expenditures. On this basis, an arrangement can be made
with international financial organizations on foreign-debt
restructuring. This would, however, require a total reform of our
tax system, reduction of ineffective expenditures and a way to
provide social protection to those who actually need it. In these
endeavors, the government might find itself taking steps at the
expense of its political prestige.
</P>
<P>
   _ Option Two: To draw up a relatively balanced budget that
presupposes an emission, or printing, of 80 billion to 100 billion
new rubles before the end of 1998. This means that 35 to 40 billion
rubles would go to the budget, 40 to 50 billion would be toward
payment of the foreign debt and 10 to 15 billion rubles would go
into Russia's banking system.
</P>
<P>
   Such a relatively balanced budget would result in a monthly
inflation rate of 5 percent to 8 percent through March. But it
would not lead to hyperinflation, and it would still enable us to
reach agreement on foreign-debt restructuring. In my view, this is
the most realistic option.
</P>
<P>
   _ Option Three: To meet the opposition's populist demands, the
government could try to solve all its problems, including those
that cannot possibly be solved, such as paying off all its debts by
December. This would call for a printing of 150 billion rubles or
so. In this case, inflation would be no less than 10 percent a
month through March.
</P>
<P>
   I think this option would be unworkable. First, it would not
promote economic development; second, it would be fraught with
serious social tensions.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, importantly, I believe that Russia has no economic
problems that cannot be solved. Everything hinges on the political
problem _ the government's weakness in the absence of any accord in
our society over the goals, means and price of reform.
</P>
<P>
   Many say that the democratic movement in Russia has suffered a
big defeat. There surely has been a political recoil. But even if
the idea of building a democracy is defeated, this does not mean
that a normal market economy cannot be built.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as spring, when I was prime minister, I thought the
main thing was to set ourselves an economic task that we could
tackle. I did not realize that in the final analysis, everything
would hinge on politics _ on the stability, wisdom and
trustworthiness of our politicians.
</P>
<P>
   We have made many mistakes, especially in grossly
underestimating the difficulty of remolding social consciousness.
One can speed up the implementation of an economic plan, but one
cannot speed up the remolding of social consciousness in the
various levels of society. All our economic theories, though
correct, tripped over this.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Russia has never seen a mere seven consecutive
years of economic reform. We simply mark time, taking two steps
backward for every forward step. What is important, however, is
that over this time of trial and error, everyone has realized that
no road exists other than the one leading to a free-market economy.

fax, 310-996-0089.  By SCOTT KIRSNER  
 FROM: Wired  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 World rights excluding Japan  
 &HT;    Furby, the 5-inch hairball with gremlin-like ears and saucer
eyes, was lying motionless on its display table.
 &HT;    And Alan Hassenfeld, the CEO of Hasbro, the world's
second-largest toy company, was in the showroom, accompanied by
Tiger Electronics' proud co-founders.
 &HT;    For Tiger, Furby was intended to be a sort of Giga Pets 2.0 _ a
follow-up to their top-grossing toy of last December. Hassenfeld
believed Tiger, a specialist in electronic gadgetry, was the
company to give Hasbro an edge over Mattel. In three days he
planned to announce Hasbro's $335 million purchase of Tiger.
 &HT;    Hassenfeld stopped in front of Furby. ``This is your bonus for
buying Tiger,'' proclaimed Tiger chair and co-founder Randy
Rissman. Jeff Jones, Tiger's vice president of marketing, flipped
the switch.
 &HT;    Furby performed on cue, opening its eyes and chattering with
delight. Though this prototype contained just 5 percent of the
functionality that the final toy would have, Hassenfeld told
Tiger's cofounders that Furby was the coolest thing he'd seen in 25
years in the business.
 &HT;    It was Fri., Feb. 6, 1998, and the next week Furby would debut
at the 95th American International Toy Fair. If all went according
to plan, it would be the BIG toy for Christmas. Yet Tiger had
rushed it into development only three months earlier, very late by
industry norms.
 &HT;    To be sure, the recent success of toys containing
microprocessors, from Tickle Me Elmo to Tamagotchi to Barney, has
buttressed the belief that technology is the toy industry's savior.
Earlier generations of high-tech toys were clunky and unresponsive
to a child _ but the newer ones insinuate themselves into their
owner's life like a pal.
 &HT;    In past months, some schools even banned virtual pets because
children were more focused on ``feeding'' them than on paying
attention to the teacher. Many parents fretted when their kids
began to mourn digital creatures that had ``croaked.'' Toys like
Furby, which exhibit rudimentary artificial intelligence, integrate
themselves even more tightly with a child's life _ speaking a
secret language, playing games, seeking praise.
 &HT;    What's more, the technology is increasingly invisible. No
instruction manual is necessary and children can have what they
most desire: the perfect friend, loyal and unconditionally loving.
 &HT;    Last year Tiger saw the virtual-pets craze coming and offered up
its line of Giga Pets to compete with Tamagotchi, marketed by
Japan's Bandai.
 &HT;    Tiger, like most toy companies, develops some toy ideas in-house
and buys others from outside inventors. Furby was developed by one
such free-lancer, a man to whom Tiger introduced me only after I
agreed not to name him. The company seemed concerned that if the
inventor, whom I'll call Eric, gets too much publicity, he may
increase the fees he demands from Tiger on future projects.
 &HT;    According to Eric, an earlier version of Furby was manually
controlled with dials and came to life like a puppet. This Furby
uttered not a chirp from its yellow beak. But, Eric said, the
finished Furby would be able to play games, communicate with other
Furbies via infrared signals, learn English by means of positive
reinforcement and teach a child Furbish (a Furby's native tongue).
No two Furbies would share the same personality or react to stimuli
in the same way.
 &HT;    Furbies would be Cabbage Patch dolls with artificial
intelligence, Tickle-Me Elmos that could influence each other. One
Furby, for example, would be able to make another Furby sneeze, or
spark a giggle fit among its friends.
 &HT;    The master plan was to bring Furby out by Christmas 1998, not in
'99 or 2000, the way other companies might to give the development
more time. Furby's category _ ``special-feature plush'' in toy-biz
lingo _ had already shown its potential, having grown 223 percent
in 1997 over the year before.
 &HT;    With other special-feature plushes, such as Microsoft's Barney
and Mattel's interactive Winnie the Pooh, already coming to market
in a big way, the category was pegged ``the hot one.''
 &HT;    Actually, on the shelves of the local Toys ``R'' Us, about 40
percent of all new toys will flop. It's not unusual for toy
companies to contribute ``markdown money'' so that retailers can
heavily discount toys that don't capture children's fancy.
 &HT;    For the toy fair, Tiger's ad agency, Posnick &AMP; Kolker of New
York (whose founders helped Coleco launch Cabbage Patch Kids in the
1980s), wrote a 30-second spot _ and filmed it over two days in
Toronto. It wasn't about technology. It was about love and
affection, spoken in the familiar language of Saturday-morning
acquisitiveness.
 &HT;    Two girls open up a cupboard, revealing a fuzzy little moving
ear, a surprised-looking set of eyes. Furby utters some Furbish.
 &HT;    First girl: ``What's that?''
 &HT;    Second girl: ``It's my Furby.''
 &HT;    In a later scene, a girl takes a Furby out of her backpack and
plays peek-a-boo with it. The ad ends with a child in bed with
Furby.
 &HT;    Toy to girl: ``Me love you.''
 &HT;    The tag line, spoken from Furby's point of view, is: ``Furby
keeps amazing you.''
 &HT;    Six weeks of production work culminated the night before the toy
fair opened, when a digital audiotape containing Furby's voice _
the last missing element _ was couriered to an editing studio in
New York.
 &HT;    With 1,704 exhibitors and 20,000 buyers, the annual show filled
New York's cavernous Javits Center and several blocks of showrooms
around the Toy Building. The only thing missing among the
white-faced mimes, Teletubbies and out-of-work actors dressed as
the Power Rangers, were children.
 &HT;    At the fair, the big retailers, such as Wal-Mart and Toys ``R''
Us, began to formulate opinions about which toys would be hits, and
which ones will merely suck up shelf space.
 &HT;    Microsoft was introducing two new characters to its ActiMates
line _ Arthur the Aardvark and his sister D.W. were to join Barney.
Mattel was hopping on the ``special-features plush'' bandwagon with
the $100 Winnie the Pooh and another interactive, Big Bird.
 &HT;    But Furby was a hands-down winner. The buyer from Wal-Mart
committed, on the spot, to buying a third of Tiger's entire
production run. Everyone wanted a piece of Furby's anticipated
success. So sure was Tiger of Furby that at one point, it even
planned to require Furby-buying retailers to order other, less-hot
toys too from its 227-page catalog.
 &HT;    After the toy fair, Furby's ears got smaller _ that was to
diminish the similarities between it and the obnoxious Gremlins of
cinematic fame.
 &HT;    Eric, the inventor, succeeded in ironing out the Furby
Communication Protocol _ the method by which two Furbies talk to
each other through bursts of infrared light.
 &HT;    Jones and colleagues worked to fabricate Furby's history _ what
they call, with a nod to Hollywood, the back story. Furby needs a
context to explain where the creature comes from, which can be
explained in TV ads and other promotional materials.
 &HT;    Tiger marked the official launch date with massive Furby
displays at key retailers like F.A.O. Schwarz's flagship store in
New York. A contest on the Cartoon Network will give children who
learn Furbish the chance to win a toy.
 &HT;    Tiger has done everything it can to make sure that Furby is THE
hot toy for Christmas, that it will have parents lining up outside

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 World rights excluding Japan  
 &HT;    Furby, the 5-inch hairball with gremlin-like ears and saucer
eyes, was lying motionless on its display table.
 &HT;    And Alan Hassenfeld, the CEO of Hasbro, the world's
second-largest toy company, was in the showroom, accompanied by
Tiger Electronics' proud co-founders.
 &HT;    For Tiger, Furby was intended to be a sort of Giga Pets 2.0 _ a
follow-up to their top-grossing toy of last December. Hassenfeld
believed Tiger, a specialist in electronic gadgetry, was the
company to give Hasbro an edge over Mattel. In three days he
planned to announce Hasbro's $335 million purchase of Tiger.
 &HT;    Hassenfeld stopped in front of Furby. ``This is your bonus for
buying Tiger,'' proclaimed Tiger chair and co-founder Randy
Rissman. Jeff Jones, Tiger's vice president of marketing, flipped
the switch.
 &HT;    Furby performed on cue, opening its eyes and chattering with
delight. Though this prototype contained just 5 percent of the
functionality that the final toy would have, Hassenfeld told
Tiger's cofounders that Furby was the coolest thing he'd seen in 25
years in the business.
 &HT;    It was Fri., Feb. 6, 1998, and the next week Furby would debut
at the 95th American International Toy Fair. If all went according
to plan, it would be the BIG toy for Christmas. Yet Tiger had
rushed it into development only three months earlier, very late by
industry norms.
 &HT;    To be sure, the recent success of toys containing
microprocessors, from Tickle Me Elmo to Tamagotchi to Barney, has
buttressed the belief that technology is the toy industry's savior.
Earlier generations of high-tech toys were clunky and unresponsive
to a child _ but the newer ones insinuate themselves into their
owner's life like a pal.
 &HT;    In past months, some schools even banned virtual pets because
children were more focused on ``feeding'' them than on paying
attention to the teacher. Many parents fretted when their kids
began to mourn digital creatures that had ``croaked.'' Toys like
Furby, which exhibit rudimentary artificial intelligence, integrate
themselves even more tightly with a child's life _ speaking a
secret language, playing games, seeking praise.
 &HT;    What's more, the technology is increasingly invisible. No
instruction manual is necessary and children can have what they
most desire: the erfect friend, loyal and unconditionally loving.
 &HT;    Last year Tiger saw the virtual-pets craze coming and offered up
its line of Giga Pets to compete with Tamagotchi, marketed by
Japan's Bandai.
 &HT;    Tiger, like most toy companies, develops some toy ideas in-house
and buys others from outside inventors. Furby was developed by one
such free-lancer, a man to whom Tiger introduced me only after I
agreed not to name him. The company seemed concerned that if the
inventor, whom I'll call Eric, gets too much publicity, he may
increase the fees he demands from Tiger on future projects.
 &HT;    According to Eric, an earlier version of Furby was manually
controlled with dials and came to life like a puppet. This Furby
uttered not a chirp from its yellow beak. But, Eric said, the
finished Furby would be able to play games, communicate with other
Furbies via infrared signals, learn English by means of positive
reinforcement and teach a child Furbish (a Furby's native tongue).
No two Furbies would share the same personality or react to stimuli
in the same way.
 &HT;    Furbies would be Cabbage Patch dolls with artificial
intelligence, Tickle-Me Elmos that could influence each other. One
Furby, for example, would be able to make another Furby sneeze, or
spark a giggle fit among its friends.
 &HT;    The master plan was to bring Furby out by Christmas 1998, not in
'99 or 2000, the way other companies might to give the development
more time. Furby's category _ ``special-feature plush'' in toy-biz
lingo _ had already shown its potential, having grown 223 percent
in 1997 over the year before.
 &HT;    With other special-feature plushes, such as Microsoft's Barney
and Mattel's interactive Winnie the Pooh, already coming to market
in a big way, the category was pegged ``the hot one.''
 &HT;    Actually, on the shelves of the local Toys ``R'' Us, about 40
percent of all new toys will flop. It's not unusual for toy
companies to contribute ``markdown money'' so that retailers can
heavily discount toys that don't capture children's fancy.
 &HT;    For the toy fair, Tiger's ad agency, Posnick &AMP; Kolker of New
York (whose founders helped Coleco launch Cabbage Patch Kids in the
1980s), wrote a 30-second spot _ and filmed it over two days in
Toronto. It wasn't about technology. It was about love and
affection, spoken in the familiar language of Saturday-morning
acquisitiveness.
 &HT;    Two girls open up a cupboard, revealing a fuzzy little moving
ear, a surprised-looking set of eyes. Furby utters some Furbish.
 &HT;    First girl: ``What's that?''
 &HT;    Second girl: ``It's my Furby.''
 &HT;    In a later scene, a girl takes a Furby out of her backpack and
plays peek-a-boo with it. The ad ends with a child in bed with
Furby.
 &HT;    Toy to girl: ``Me love you.''
 &HT;    The tag line, spoken from Furby's point of view, is: ``Furby
keeps amazing you.''
 &HT;    Six weeks of production work culminated the night before the toy
fair opened, when a digital audiotape containing Furby's voice _
the last missing element _ was couriered to an editing studio in
New York.
 &HT;    With 1,704 exhibitors and 20,000 buyers, the annual show filled
New York's cavernous Javits Center and several blocks of showrooms
around the Toy Building. The only thing missing among the
white-faced mimes, Teletubbies and out-of-work actors dressed as
the Power Rangers, were children.
 &HT;    At the fair, the big retailers, such as Wal-Mart and Toys ``R''
Us, began to formulate opinions about which toys would be hits, and
which ones will merely suck up shelf space.
 &HT;    Microsoft was introducing two new characters to its ActiMates
line _ Arthur the Aardvark and his sister D.W. were to join Barney.
Mattel was hopping on the ``special-features plush'' bandwagon with
the $100 Winnie the Pooh and another interactive, Big Bird.
 &HT;    But Furby was a hands-down winner. The buyer from Wal-Mart
committed, on the spot, to buying a third of Tiger's entire
production run. Everyone wanted a piece of Furby's anticipated
success. So sure was Tiger of Furby that at one point, it even
planned to require Furby-buying retailers to order other, less-hot
toys too from its 227-page catalog.
 &HT;    After the toy fair, Furby's ears got smaller _ that was to
diminish the similarities between it and the obnoxious Gremlins of
cinematic fame.
 &HT;    Eric, the inventor, succeeded in ironing out the Furby
Communication Protocol _ the method by which two Furbies talk to
each other through bursts of infrared light.
 &HT;    Jones and colleagues worked to fabricate Furby's history _ what
they call, with a nod to Hollywood, the back story. Furby needs a
context to explain where the creature comes from, which can be
explained in TV ads and other promotional materials.
 &HT;    Tiger marked the official launch date with massive Furby
displays at key retailers like F.A.O. Schwarz's flagship store in
New York. A contest on the Cartoon Network will give children who
learn Furbish the chance to win a toy.
 &HT;    Tiger has done everything it can to make sure that Furby is THE
hot toy for Christmas, that it will have parents lining up outside
the nearest Wal-Mart, awaiting shipments, begging for rain checks.
Based on orders, Tiger suspects that 1.5 million Furbies _ the
number they hope to produce by the end of 1998 _ won't be enough to
satisfy the demand.

 &HT;    PARIS _ People have begun to ask whether Hillary Rodham Clinton
is likely to be elected president of the United States. At this
point, the answer is evidently no, but the question does reflect a
remarkable development in her role and the way she is perceived.
 &HT;    Throughout President Bill Clinton's ordeal by sex-lie scandal,
Mrs. Clinton has carried on as though she had no personal concerns.
Her stamina and her strength have made a huge difference in her
husband's ability to weather the attacks so far.
 &HT;    The troubles aren't quite over yet, but the issue now is more
how congressional Republicans are going to get rid of the
impeachment question than it is the fate of the president. Censure
strikes me as a rather pointless, artificial way of avoiding their
responsibility to conclude what has been started.
 &HT;    The argument that some formal punishment must be imposed to show
that Mr. Clinton earned the disapproval of the legislature and many
compatriots is fatuous. That criticism has already been very widely
recorded.
 &HT;    Some do seem to resent, however, that he has borne it all
without any signs of the emotional distress and self-abasement that
would seem inescapable for most people. He is probably sustained by
the same force of confidence that led him to feel he could ignore
the proprieties and get away with it. That trait got him into
trouble, and it is seeing him through, with Hillary's indispensable
help.
 &HT;    She has gone through several transformations in their years at
the peak of American politics. She wanted to share in the rewards
as well as the effort. There was a lively, joyful modern air of
equality and partnership in their early campaign theme of ``two for
the price of one,'' but it boomeranged. Feminism hasn't won that
much support from Americans.
 &HT;    So she shifted to less assertive, less political subjects,
gentled her style, and made more of the wife-and-mother role which
American political usage seems to demand. But that turned out to be
a lot tougher than the traditional routine, and she responded again
with intense, carefully programmed activity. Now she is on the
cover of Vogue, a first for a presidential wife, and will be Time's
Woman of the Year, and American-watchers around the world are
wondering about her future.
 &HT;    Mrs. Clinton is a fine public speaker, poised, generating
conviction, able to think quickly on her feet. In January this
year, not long after the Monica story broke, she appeared at the
World Economic Forum in Davos to talk about education and
development. She showed no diffidence or embarrassment, and the
several thousand business and political leaders present gave her a
standing ovation.
 &HT;    A question was passed up to her. ``Don't you think it's time for
the U.S. to choose an intelligent, capable woman president?''
Without stopping for breath, she laughed and found the perfect
diplomatic answer. ``Yes, and I look forward to voting for her.''
 &HT;    Clearly, the intention was to lure her into declaring a
candidacy for herself, but she is no political dummy. In current
circumstances, it is hard to imagine her name on a ballot. It would
be fun to see her as vice-presidential candidate on an Al Gore
ticket for 2000, but entertaining the voters isn't what campaign
consultants recommend.
 &HT;    Still, Mrs. Clinton has now established herself as an effective
public figure in her own right, both in the United States and in
the many foreign countries where she has made successful trips. She
is too young, too energetic, too full of ideas, too competent to
disappear politely when she is no longer first lady. There have
been rumors that the couple will split up after they leave the
White House, the aftermath of the scandal, but their pact has
proven extraordinarily solid so far.
 &HT;    The issues that were shoved aside and drowned out by Monicagate
are all still there, and she has developed considerable expertise
in addressing them. No doubt she will find a platform to enable her
to continue, whatever her husband chooses as his next career, for
he will have one.
 &HT;    The nearest thing to a precedent for Mrs. Clinton's
self-launched activism was Eleanor Roosevelt, also a stubborn,
persistent, innovative woman who had to put up with a lot. She was
demeaned, even detested, but she kept on with the humane causes she
thought important and now she is remembered with love and
gratitude.
 &HT;    Just where it will take her isn't clear, but certainly Mrs.
Clinton is not coming to the end of her road in 2000.

 By CHARLES McGRATH  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    When I was in college, there was a guy famous for wrapping his
brand-new Weejuns with duct tape so that it would look as though
his soles were already flapping. He also, or so it was said, took
brand-new shirts from Brooks Brothers and painstakingly frayed the
cuffs with sandpaper.
 &HT;    This was at Yale in the late '60s, during the last wheezing gasp
_ the final catarrh _ of the patrician ethos that held that the
ultimate status, the highest social perch, belonged to those who
seemingly paid no attention to status. That poor Yalie, with his
tape and sandpaper, made the fatal mistake, of course: He cared too
much and, worse, was seen to care. But in other respects he
understood the code perfectly.
 &HT;    In those days, old was still good. Shabby was good. Instead of
renting a tuxedo, for example, or even buying a new one, it was far
cooler to borrow your great-uncle Ned's _ that hand-sewn mohair
dreadnought, now mossy with age, that he wore to the Stork Club in
the '40s while squiring tipsy debutantes.
 &HT;    What recommended this mothy garment was not just its special
flask pocket or the cigarette burn on the left lapel but that it
(quietly) advertised you as someone who came from tuxedo-wearing
stock, the sort of people who donned formal wear all the time and
not just on self-conscious occasions.
 &HT;    This particular social code owed a lot, obviously, to the old
WASP tradition, with its shunning of vulgar display and its
reverence for old (as opposed to new) anything _ houses, silver,
furniture and, especially, money. And American WASP-iness _
filtered through our Puritan heritage _ in turn owes something to
an imagined ideal of life among the landed British gentry.
 &HT;    You can see the real thing, lovingly and comically depicted, in
the novels of Nancy Mitford or, more recently, in ``The Dower
House,'' by Annabel Davis-Goff, a novel about arguably the most
puritanically class- and status-obsessed people who ever lived: the
Anglo-Irish, who by the 1960s, when this book is set, are neither
truly English nor truly Irish anymore. All they have left, their
sole badge of identity, is good breeding (among themselves and,
just as important, among their dogs and horses) and their dwindling
store of heirlooms.
 &HT;    In the novel's funniest and most painful scene, the scion of a
noble but down-at-the-heels family describes his attempt to repair
his family's fortunes by marrying a girl from London: The courtship
has to be abandoned when, in a shocking display of commonness, she
carries her handbag down to breakfast.
 &HT;    In midcentury America, you didn't have to be a WASP to
appreciate WASP values. In Irish Boston, where I grew up _ Catholic
Irish, not the other kind _ the middle and working classes
sedulously adopted the customs and preferences of their Yankee
overlords. Men took pride in how often their shoes had been reshod,
in the number of times their car odometers had ticked over.
 &HT;    When our next-door neighbor pulled up one evening in a
late-model Cadillac, eyebrows were raised for weeks _ until it was
discovered that he had inherited it from his father-in-law, who was
an undertaker.
 &HT;    For WASP and non-WASP alike, the old status indicators _ thrift,
simplicity, understatement, self-effacement _ made a virtue of the
inescapable: ignorance, insecurity, penury, not to say stinginess.
They also placed a not entirely inappropriate value on history _ on
things (and the people who owned them) that had stood the test of
time.
 &HT;    So what happened? WASP, where is thy sting? Already when I was
in college, there were hints of a new elite, of non-status-seeking
pursued with unimaginable rigor. There were people who didn't even
own Weejuns, much less tape them _ who either didn't know the code
or didn't care and militantly rejected the very idea of property
and hierarchy. (Many of them, after brief stints on the commune,
went on to lucrative careers in investment banking and commercial
real estate.)
 &HT;    And then there were the puritans and the minimalists; you see
them even now, or their descendants, down on Spring Street on
Saturday afternoons _ Mom, Dad and Baby all clad in black, eating
rice cakes and drinking designer water.
 &HT;    The WASP's, meanwhile, fell from their once-lofty ascendance,
done in by inheritance taxes, inbreeding and newly rigorous
admissions standards at the very institutions they once regarded as
their finishing schools. Uncle Ned, were he alive now, would no
longer be working at the family firm. (It was bought out by the
Japanese years ago.)
 &HT;    There's also not enough old stuff to go around anymore. (At a
Sotheby's show of ``important Americana'' recently, I spotted among
the highboys and the sideboards an item labeled ``Sheraton style
... 20th century.'' It was a 1950s coffee table.)
 &HT;    But a more fundamental trouble with the old WASP idea of status
was that it depended on a code as subtle and as complicated as
18th-century calling-card etiquette. The line between an heirloom
and a piece of junk was often hard to draw, as was that between
being ``old shoe'' and looking like a bum. As time went on, fewer
and fewer people knew the signals, until they ceased to be
recognized even by the people who were sending them.
 &HT;    When you think about it, there was probably something phony and
overearnest about America's long romance with gentility and
authenticity. We have always been vulgar _ it's our defining trait.
At the turn of the century, the really rich and really
status-conscious Americans, the people who set the tone that so
many aspired to, were not self-effacing or puritanical at all.
 &HT;    This is the great theme of Edith Wharton and Henry James, that
the Gilded Agers literally wanted entitlement. They wanted palaces
and noble lineage, and they wanted real history, so they went to
Europe and brought it all back _ instant class. Such is the miracle
of America: you can get it now in a good department store in the
Ralph Lauren boutique.
 &HT;    Lauren's genius has been to provide not only stuff that looks
new and feels old _ loafers with a patina of invisible duct tape,
so to speak _ but also a prepackaged ancestral past: cotillions,
hunts, summers at the Adirondack camp. An Uncle Ned for everyone.

 By R.W. APPLE JR.  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    I came to Washington, I always thought, with all the right
stuff: an Ivy League degree, a job on a big-time newspaper, a belly
full of skepticism and a brain littered with assorted information
on throw-weights, T-bills and reapportionment.
 &HT;    I knew who George W. Norris and Arthur Vandenberg and Rexford G.
Tugwell were, and I knew the difference between grands crus and
grand larceny.
 &HT;    I had once had tea at Alice Roosevelt Longworth's.
 &HT;    That pretty well did the trick in the 1970s and 1980s, but not,
alas, in the 1990s. I'm out of some pretty important loops now,
status-wise, because I know little about television and less about
movies. Now that Hollywood narcissism has displaced Rhodes-scholar
earnestness as Washington's controlling ethos, with Barbra
Streisand and David Geffen supplanting George Stephanopoulos and
Robert Reich as prototypical Buddies of Bill, you have to have a
Tinseltown-size appetite for celebrity to keep up in the capital.
 &HT;    Time was, a stiff, black-on-ecru invitation to one of the
soirees given by the grandes dames of Washington was the premier
status symbol. At Evangeline Bruce's or Pamela Harriman's houses,
you might meet the head of the CIA or the members of the permanent
Establishment, those people who had long outlived the
administration that first brought them to town. You might impress
them by your knowledge of the minutiae of politics and government.
 &HT;    The Clintons were launched into Washington by a gala dinner at
Harriman's, come to think of it, but they have long since turned
their backs on most of the people listed in the Green Book,
choosing the glamorous over the grandees.
 &HT;    Me, I still get invited to the British Embassy once in a while,
and before relations between The New York Times and the Clintons
turned testy, I even got asked to the White House a time or two.
But when I failed to recognize Annette Bening at a star-studded
reception at the time of the Clinton inaugural, some of my friends
pitied me. And when I expressed doubts about colleagues who were
trying to turn themselves into celebrities through the pundit
circuit, others dropped me.
 &HT;    The litmus paper changed color especially quickly at the annual
springtime black-tie dinners for Washington reporters and their
guests. They used to be an occasion for us groundlings to chat with
publicity-averse administration officials. (I remember getting Bob
Haldeman in a corner once, the only time I ever talked to him.)
 &HT;    Now, in an effort to make the other guests forget the cheap wine
and the lame jokes, the newsies ask Robert De Niro and Kim Basinger
(and one year, disastrously, the New York shock-jock Don Imus) as
well as Lloyd Cutler and Colin Powell.
 &HT;    The new Washington ought to adopt Suzanne Stone as its mascot.
She was the rapacious small-town weather girl in ``To Die For''
(played by Nicole Kidman, I think) who said you're nothing if
you're not on television. ``What's the point of doing anything
worthwhile,'' she asked, ``if nobody's watching?''
 &HT;    Good question, thinks Washington, vintage 1998, and it has made
Larry King, Tim Russert and Sam and Cokie _ or rather their air
time _ the real forum of American political discourse, eclipsing
the Senate and the House.
 &HT;    During the debate in October about impeachment hearings, Rep.
Robert Wexler, a Florida Democrat, gave the game away. He said that
he wanted to tell his colleagues, ``in the most friendly and
respectful way that I know,'' that he and Rep. Robert Barr, a
Georgia Republican, were scheduled to appear that evening on the
``Crossfire'' program, so he planned to postpone his comments in
the House ``in an effort not to ruin the show.'' No wonder it's
been said that Washington is Hollywood for ugly people.
 &HT;    Everybody's avocation in America is show business, said the man
who wrote ``To Die For,'' Buck Henry. So I guess it's not all that
surprising that President Clinton has got into the game, playing
his sax and discussing his underwear on TV. Or that he spends
almost as much time at fund-raisers in the ballroom of the Century
Plaza as producers, stars and starlets spend in the Lincoln
Bedroom.
 &HT;    Plenty of other Washington heavy-hitters have been fascinated by
Hollywood. But past Presidents kept their psychic distance. John F.
Kennedy was always the star, not the Rat Pack. Bill Clinton, the
unabashed fan of Elvis, is the first star-struck president. I
didn't know Marilyn Monroe, but I know Markie Post is no Marilyn
Monroe.
 &HT;    The president does favors for movieland friends, like arranging
for his national security adviser, Sandy Berger, to brief a group
led by John Travolta on the administration's stand on Scientology.
They, in turn, do favors for him. It's all very chummy.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, former presidents such as Jimmy Carter and Gerald
Ford and eminent senators such as Daniel Patrick Moynihan don't
waste their breath defending Clinton. To the chattering classes of
Georgetown and Cleveland Park, Washington seems critically short of
political heroes these days. But maybe they don't listen to the
right people or read the right publications.
 &HT;    For Hollywood has a whole different take on Clinton's
difficulties. Discussing the president with Elle magazine this
fall, the actress Sharon Stone said this: ``I think Clinton's a
fantastic president. He's done so much good in the world. And
people do not want to assign him the successes of his office. They
only want to assign him the failures. It's really ugly.''
 &HT;    Marshall Herskovitz, executive producer of ``Thirtysomething,''
said recently that Hollywood was more forgiving of Clinton than
other people because it does not see marriage as ``a monolithic
simple entity.''
 &HT;    And Bette Midler told Larry King: ``I feel that he and his wife
have been hounded for the past six years, actually, since they
walked in the door. ... I think he's the smartest guy we ever
had.''
 &HT;    Nowhere else, except in the Congressional Black Caucus and among
the trial lawyers _ surely not among his former aides and onetime
enthusiasts in the universities _ does Clinton get that kind of
unconditional praise.
 &HT;    Maybe it's not surprising that in Washington and in California,
the gossips _ the same ones, now that politics is a subset of
celebrity _ keep whispering that Clinton will go to work one day
for Dreamworks, the entertainment company that Geffen runs with two
other Clinton enthusiasts, Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg,
and live next door to Tom Hanks.
 &HT;    He certainly won't move to Georgetown, where I live, along with
a lot of other people who don't quite fit the new mold. I admit
that I'm of two minds about the status revolution in Washington. I
rather enjoyed playing the old game _ when inside information was
the coin of the realm _ and so naturally I wish I knew more about
the new rules and the redrawn playing field.
 &HT;    But I fear, square that I am, that the whole culture of
celebrity worship has tainted the country, its politics and my
trade as well. In Washington, as elsewhere, fame and fortune, not
talent and perseverance, are now what's most widely respected.
Ex-actors and ex-athletes and relatives of ex-politicians occupy
more and more seats in Congress.
 &HT;    They have instant ``name recognition,'' which is almost as
useful in campaigns these days as money, which propels other people
into high office. You have to wonder whether Abe Lincoln _ homely,
provincial and poor _ would have had a shot at the modern White
House.
 &HT;    Note too that candidates have adopted the techniques of show
business and of marketing, its comrade in hoopla. Both politicians
and producers know that violence sells; as with car chases and gory
murders in movies, TV commercials filled with distorted and
negative language dominate our barren campaigns.
 &HT;    Candidates for important offices no longer proclaim programs and
ideas first and invite people to support them. They take polls to
discover what people think and then develop policies. In other
words, they convene focus groups (cf. sneak previews in Hollywood)
before editing their ideas (cf. recutting the picture).
 &HT;    Politicians' debilitating and humiliating loss of privacy is, of
course, related to the celebrification of politics; we eavesdrop on
Leonardo DiCaprio's love life _ why not on Bill Clinton's? The
voyeur that lurks in each of us has been given more room to do his
stuff, denying it all the while.
 &HT;    Similarly, journalists' loss of standing must have something to
do with the fact that they have emerged from relative anonymity,
reporting less and talking more, part of an ever-growing mountain
of commentary resting on an ever-shrinking base of fact.
 &HT;    I don't blame the man in the street for making very little
distinction between what I do and what Geraldo Rivera does, and
thinking little of either of us. But I don't pretend to like that
particular change in status.

 By WARREN HOGE  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    The royal train, sleek and black with pencil-thin red trimming,
is hurtling toward Newcastle, and inside one of the armored middle
cars, Charles, the prince of Wales, is taking his breakfast.
 &HT;    He's dressed down in an open-collar white-and-burgundy striped
shirt, blue cardigan and khaki trousers, and as I enter the cabin,
his look of welcome is mixed with one of concern.
 &HT;    ``I do hope you managed to get some sleep,'' he says, motioning
me to sit across from him.
 &HT;    Gales and lashing rain had rolled in from the North Sea as we
made our midnight departure from Perth, and the heir to the throne
seems to be apologizing for turbulence in the realm.
 &HT;    ``Ghastly night,'' he says.
 &HT;    Freshly done up in blond wood with little ornamentation, the
coach reflects a new reduced configuration aimed at cutting the
train's operating cost. Part of royal downsizing? I ask.
 &HT;    ``Yes,'' he nods. ``What you see is the anorexic British
monarchy.''
 &HT;    In a corner bookcase, there is a small vase of flowers and a
picture of the Queen Mother, said to be Prince Charles' favorite
member of the family. Earlier her two corgis, Dash and Rash, had
taken their morning stroll through the carpeted corridors, friskily
tugging at the leash held by her footman, Leslie Campbell.
 &HT;    The prince's face is ruddy from a blustery weekend at his home
on the Balmoral estate in Scotland, and gray is making a debonair
debut in his thinning hair. His ears are large, as advertised, but
they ride closer to his head and in happier proportion to it than
cartoonists' pens would have you believe.
 &HT;    He speaks so softly that I have to strain to hear him even in
the stillness of the cabin, with its thick, bulletproof windows
keeping out the clatter of our passage along England's northeastern
coast.
 &HT;    Smartly turned out crewmen in navy blazers, charcoal gray
trousers and black shoes shined to a military gloss place before
the prince a silver tray with small jars of preserves and honeys
and a bowl of wheat germ and cereal grains, all of which meet his
high threshold for unadulterated, healthful food.
 &HT;    He reaches for a container of honey, opens it and spoons the
golden spread directly into his mouth. I think I am observing royal
prerogative.
 &HT;    ``I actually don't eat very much at all,'' he says, confirming
the warnings I had received minutes earlier from the butlers and
security men in the mess car as they tucked into their heaping
platefuls of eggs, tomatoes, mushrooms, sausage, bacon and toast.
 &HT;    In fact the atmosphere around the prince and his once-embattled
retinue is assured and upbeat these days. Not long ago the most
reviled member of the British royal family, Charles was able on his
50th birthday in November to look back on a year in which he was
liberated from the competition with Diana, the princess of Wales,
for attention and approval.
 &HT;    He also was given credit previously denied him for being a
sensitive parent to his two sons; was celebrated by the new Labor
government of Prime Minister Tony Blair for the pioneering social
work his Prince's Trust has done; and was encouraged by
significantly growing public endorsement of him as the next
sovereign and of his mistress, Camilla Parker Bowles, as his
private life companion and possible wife.
 &HT;    He has turned the most convulsive moment in his life _ the death
in August 1997 of his former wife, Diana _ into an opportunity for
staging his own revival and for staking a strong claim on the role
of guiding the monarchy into the 21st century.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, his progress has freshened the image of the monarchy.
Mutinous feelings in Britain toward the royals have subsided, and
the major player in disarming the public has surprisingly been
Prince Charles.
 &HT;    For a long time the percussive, single-syllable words like
``twit,'' ``wimp'' and ''prat'' that Britons use to dress down
their well-born often accompanied mention of his name. The product
of an undemonstrative mother, a chastising father and the decidedly
uncozy Windsor household, Charles suffered from self-doubt and
appeared hesitant and distracted in the face of the burdensome
demands of his awesome inheritance.
 &HT;    The question he most commonly puts to people he encounters now
on his official rounds _ ``What do you do?'' _ is one he might have
best avoided years ago for fear someone might ask him back.
 &HT;    When he got around to doing something, he only made matters
worse, uttering ill-thought-out and crudely stated condemnations of
modern architecture, medicine and education. By the time Diana
began attracting favorable attention for her visits to AIDS wards
and refugee camps, Charles had marked himself as something of a
young fogy, dismissing new approaches to old problems as
``fashionable.''
 &HT;    What's more, he was conducting a personal life that became an
ongoing tabloid saga complete with confessional television
interviews and smutty tape recordings of stunningly graceless
sexual small talk.
 &HT;    Recently, however, newspaper and magazine articles and new books
assessing him in connection with his birthday have portrayed a
new-look prince and declared him an underacknowledged overachiever
whose good works went unnoticed in the press onslaught on his
shortcomings.
 &HT;    Anthony Holden, a royal biographer considered hostile by the
prince's supporters and denied all cooperation for his new book,
``Charles at Fifty,'' concluded that ``the human qualities well
known to his inner circle, for all the battering they took during
the Diana years, have come back to the fore. If not entirely at
peace with himself, he is more so with the world around him. Throw
in the shrewdest advisers he has had since his youth, extending
beyond his own office to the inner councils of government, and you
have a public figure suddenly and unexpectedly at the peak of his
powers, bloodied but unbowed by his past, with cause for unwonted
optimism about his future.''
 &HT;    The prince's schedule for this day alone calls for him to spend
seven hours opening a home for the aged, a glass museum, a
job-training center and, most improbably, an oil rig. True, there's
nothing new about the prince of Wales going off to lay cornerstones
and plant trees. In 1997, he had 513 engagements like this.
 &HT;    What is new is that he is no longer alone with his ceremonial
shovel. People are paying attention, and they are doing so because
the ideas of a man long associated with the country's past now seem
very much a part of its future.
 &HT;    Back in the staff mess car, one of Charles' aides confided that
he believed the most significant factor in the changing fortunes of
the prince was the election in May 1997 of Tony Blair and the Labor
Party: ``Suddenly his views became part of the political language
of this country.''
 &HT;    It is a breathtaking fact that many of the reforms the Labor
government is pursuing _ getting private enterprise engaged in
public service and opening up opportunities for young people,
minorities and the unemployed _ are ones that have been undertaken
for years by a member of the famously out-of-touch British
monarchy. On issues such as the environment, genetically modified
food and organic farming, the prince has even bolder prescriptions
than the government.
 &HT;    Where the queen just this year rode in her first public taxi,
walked into her first McDonald's and visited her first pub, Prince
Charles has been tramping through housing projects for two decades.
In 1976, he began a program that made loans available to young
people whom banks wouldn't go near, and the idea is credited with
having helped more than 40,000 people to start new businesses.
 &HT;    Several people who run sections of the Prince's Trust said they
know Charles was motivated to act in the 1980s by evidence that
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's economic revolution was leaving
Britain's poor unprotected and marginalized.
 &HT;    ``It wasn't that he used her name,'' said one executive close to
the prince. ``He spoke out when it was very unfashionable to have
these concerns, and he was the one who persuaded business it had to
enter areas that the government was abandoning.''
 &HT;    Financed by the consolidation of three royal trusts and by
contributions from corporations and individuals, the trust today
manages an endowment of $125 million.
 &HT;    Blair's people have praised the prince for his foresightedness,
and the prince has expressed his pleasure that Labor has found
inspiration in his good works. One gleeful Labor official said,
``He was a Blairite before Blair.''
 &HT;    In contrast, the queen is not known to have any political
viewpoints, and in her long years on the throne she has never been
caught out expressing one. She and Prince Philip are reported by
biographers to be put off by their eldest son's social activism in
general and the perception that he could be playing favorites in
Britain's public life.
 &HT;    The prince has not responded to the grumbling in the House of
Commons about his role, but he has long said the monarchy of the
future should be ``a contributing monarchy.''
 &HT;    In a letter to Tom Shebbeare, the head of the trust, five years
ago, he addressed the question, saying, ``I have no 'political'
agenda _ only a desire to see people achieve their potential.'' He
reasoned that his ability to get attention made him ``a catalyst to
help produce a better and more balanced response to various
problems.''
 &HT;    The prince has known the prime minister since 1990, when Blair
was Labor's shadow employment secretary and took an interest in the
work the Prince's Trust was doing in the area of youth employment.
Their relationship was to deepen in the immediate aftermath of the
death of Diana, as the royal family found itself tone-deaf to the
sorrow and anger of the nation and looked to the newly triumphant
Labor government for help tuning in.
 &HT;    Blair and the prince spoke by phone during the flight Charles
made to Paris to bring Diana's body back to Britain, and associates
of the prime minister played a prominent role in planning the
funeral and in encouraging the royal family to respond to the
outpouring of grief. The prince is the member of the family
credited with convincing the palace that it was too remote, and
much of his counsel came from Blair officials.
 &HT;    Today, on the prince's staff are none of the advisers who
counseled him to confess his adultery in a 1994 television
interview, a strategic decision he now regrets.
 &HT;    While the queen has kept her private secretaries for decades at
a time, Charles has had six since 1985, a measure of his
temperamental leadership. He has now settled down and reached out
to the worlds of politics and entertainment for help. By design,
his staff is no longer all male, all white, all Oxford- and
Cambridge-educated.
 &HT;    Often at odds with their more tradition-bound counterparts in
Buckingham Palace, the prince's people are busy putting forth their
man as the voice of the monarchy's future, even going so far as to
set up his own Web site _ www.princeofwales.gov.uk.
 &HT;    The prince's current honeymoon with the British press began
after a simple act of reconciliation suggested by his new aides.
For 10 years, he had not directed a personal word at any of the
reporters covering him.
 &HT;    Then, on a trip between South Africa and Swaziland last year, a
shirt-sleeved prince walked back to the economy section of the
plane where the press was riding and struck up conversations. He
captivated the surprised reporters with a few jokes on himself, and
by the same afternoon The Evening Standard was on the streets of
London with a front page saying, ``Chattering Charles Plays Royal
Tour Joker.''
 &HT;    The charm offensive was on. Public appearances increased and
Charles began to be seen at West End first nights, film openings,
Spice Girl concerts _ in short, the circles where Diana once
reigned. The usual titled guests at dinners at St. James' Palace
and at Highgrove found themselves seated next to Charles' new
friends, such as Emma Thompson and Rowan Atkinson, whose comic
creation Mr. Bean has come, like the prince, to represent the
lovable side of English awkwardness.
 &HT;    The Sun, Britain's largest-selling tabloid and long a Charles
tormentor, became the recipient of leaks from the prince's office
and made a rapid conversion to the rehabilitation cause. The prince
and his organic garden at Highgrove were lovingly chronicled in
celebrity magazines such as Hello!
 &HT;    Charles took his sons to Vancouver, where they publicly
frolicked in the caps of the Canadian Winter Olympics team. And, in
a gesture interpreted as a truce, the prince agreed to serve as
patron for a new press ball.
 &HT;    At a televised birthday gala, the prince became the star of the
show, appearing in a skit with the actors Stephen Fry and Roger
Moore. The scene was a restaurant, and look-alikes of Michael
Jackson, Tina Turner, Madonna and Humphrey Bogart appeared on stage
as Fry and Moore, the diners, tried unsuccessfully to guess who
they were.
 &HT;    Charles, an accomplished college actor at Cambridge, then walked
on, playing a waiter with a cloth napkin slung over his forearm and
a pen and pad at the ready. When the cheers died down, he
recommended the organic vegetables and cookies made from the
Highgrove granary. ``They're damn good,'' he said.
 &HT;    Moore pondered the prince's performance. ``I know who you're
supposed to be, but you are going to have work on your voice a
bit,'' he said to the laughing crowd.
 &HT;    The aides who have helped engineer the turnabout in public
opinion are encouraged about the future. ``We find doors flying
open everywhere now where we had to really struggle before,'' one
said.
 &HT;    Though the recognition of the prince's pioneering
accomplishments and the public sympathy for him as a single parent
have given him new balance, Charles can still stumble over his
bulky collection of resentments.
 &HT;    There is, first and foremost, the somewhat icy, always
complicated relationship with his parents. It is clear too that the
prince has not fully freed himself from the sense of anger he felt
a year ago at being cast as a villain who betrayed a saint, a
careless adulterer who married a virgin for dynastic reasons and
then destroyed her emotionally.
 &HT;    ``You know the prince thought that Diana was on a mission to
destroy him,'' one courtier explained. He recalled a night in which
Charles could talk of nothing else until the aide, a relative
newcomer to the staff, said: ``You can't keep going on like this.
You must get on with your future.''
 &HT;    The prince agreed that he was being ``obsessive'' but insisted
on talking on. ``Unless you hear what went on in the past,'' he
said, ``you won't understand how I am today.''
 &HT;    How he is today, friends say, is a lot more pleasant than he
used to be, and the behavior figures prominently in his
rehabilitation.
 &HT;    ``He's actually doing the same things he did before,'' said a
Prince's Trust executive, ``but he is much more relaxed and
confident that he can do things on his own. It helps not having
someone out there saying, 'I can do that better than you can.'''
 &HT;    Of course, he is still far from taming his notorious moodiness
or mastering his tantrums, but the best antidote to them, Camilla
Parker Bowles, is more frequently at hand.
 &HT;    ``He is a world-class, wall-to-wall whinger,'' one of his
closest aides said, invoking the English word for whining that
makes self-pity sound even more insufferable.
 &HT;    A woman who heads up one of his charities looked aghast at the
recollection of a moment when she lost patience with the prince and
apparently lost track of whom she was speaking to. ``He does moan
about so,'' she said. ``One day I just said to him: 'Stop
complaining. We all have problem parents.'''

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    In death as in life, Jason Altom managed to be both extremely
methodical and extraordinarily good-hearted.
 &HT;    On the warm, humid day in mid-August when he ended his life, he
walked up to the third-floor bedroom of the Somerville, Mass.,
house he shared with two fellow graduate students at Harvard
University, drank a liquid laced with cyanide procured from the
very chemistry laboratory where he was considered an unusually
gifted student and lay down on his bed.
 &HT;    Having accounted for the remote possibility that his own death
might endanger others, the 26-year-old doctoral candidate left a
warning note on the bed.
 &HT;    ``Do Not Resuscitate,'' it read. ``Danger: Potassium Cyanide.''
 &HT;    As one of his roommates explained to me later, ``I think he was
worried, in his meticulous way, that someone might try to give him
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.''
 &HT;    It is not for that note, but rather for the three suicide notes
Jason left on the nightstand next to his bed, that his death has
had reverberations far beyond Harvard.
 &HT;    One was addressed to his parents, a second to the chairman of
Harvard's chemistry department and the third to his graduate
adviser, the Nobel laureate Elias J. Corey.
 &HT;    Work in the chemistry labs ground to a halt that weekend as word
of Jason's death swept through one after another of Harvard's 16
chem lab groups and then, by phone and E-mail, out into the
tightknit international community of chemists, some 600 of whom had
trained with Corey over the last half century.
 &HT;    Any suicide is shocking, but this one was especially so. Widely
known and well liked, Jason was by all accounts the golden boy of
the Corey group, perhaps the finest synthetic organic chemistry
laboratory anywhere in the world.
 &HT;    The following Monday morning, Corey, a vigorous 70-year-old,
delivered the devastating news to the department chairman, James G.
Anderson. ``He was just shocked and dismayed and heartbroken,''
Anderson said later. ``I had never seen him so distraught.''
 &HT;    Four weeks later, the Altom family shared with The Harvard
Crimson the contents of Jason's suicide note to the chemistry
department chairman. The paper published excerpts in its Sept. 14
issue.
 &HT;    ``This event could have been avoided,'' the note began.
``Professors here have too much power over the lives of their grad
students.'' The letter recommended adoption of a three-member
faculty committee to monitor each graduate student's progress and
``provide protection for graduate students from abusive research
advisers. If I had such a committee now I know things would be
different.''
 &HT;    It was the first time, a columnist for The Crimson observed
later, that a suicide note took the form of a policy memo.
 &HT;    Like a raw, angry Rorschach blot, the notes inspired different
interpretations in different quarters. Some graduates of Harvard's
chemistry program volunteered the opinion that Altom's letter
eerily and lucidly confirmed longstanding concerns about the
pressures of the Harvard chemistry program in general and the Corey
lab in particular.
 &HT;    As every ensuing bit of coverage dutifully noted, it was the
second suicide to hit the Corey group in less than two years and
the third since 1980. Others felt Corey was being unfairly
tarnished.
 &HT;    By the time I went up to Cambridge, the much-publicized suicide
had already inspired a number of changes, including the
three-member thesis committee suggested by Jason, a program of
lectures to stress alternative careers for Ph.D.s, more
opportunities for social interaction between students and free
confidential access to a therapist, with Harvard picking up the
tab. The suicide note, in short, had catalyzed major changes.
 &HT;    But as I began to speak with Jason's friends and colleagues, I
quickly learned that the situation was more complicated than the
notes had implied.
 &HT;    The people who knew Jason Altom best were as stunned and
confused by the anger of his letters, which Jason's family later
shared with them, as by his death. No one had had the slightest
inkling that Jason felt unfairly treated by his adviser _ not the
roommate who watched TV with him the night before his death, not
the postdoc with whom he shared a lab (and who marveled at the
amount of attention Jason received from Corey), not the six friends
with whom he socialized during his five years in Cambridge, not the
other roommate who furiously pedaled his bicycle home on a Saturday
morning in August when he'd been told that something terrible had
happened.
 &HT;    That roommate, Andrew Black, could imagine a burglary, a fire, a
calamity to another resident in the house, but never something to
do with Jason. ``I can't tell you how shocking it was,'' he said.
 &HT;    If Jason's death may not have had much to do with the incendiary
accusations contained in his letters, as many of his friends seemed
to suggest, it was nonetheless inextricably linked to the pressures
of graduate-school life _ not just at Harvard but at every
top-flight university where competitive overachievers aspire to
become scientists.
 &HT;    And if it were indeed an avoidable death, the reasons may have
less to do with the reforms already in place and more to do with
chemistry of a different sort _ not the textbook chemistry of
orbitals and bonds, but the more mysterious and nuanced kind
between two extremely bright human beings locked in a typically
intense graduate-school relationship.
 &HT;    Every year in October, when the Nobel Prizes in chemistry,
physics and medicine or physiology are announced, the predictable
parade of American honorees is reported on television and in the
papers with a combination of patriotic glee and almost total
befuddlement about the nature of the work being honored.
 &HT;    Hardly anyone pauses to think about the educational system that
has been so fabulously productive in turning out scientists in this
country. It is a system limited to about 120 research institutions,
and at the upper, rarefied reaches of that system are the elite
universities.
 &HT;    As James Anderson, chairman of Harvard's chemistry department,
puts it: ``The students here are spectacularly good, very bright,
very committed. They want to win Nobel Prizes, and some of them
will, and some of them want to do it before they're 30.''
 &HT;    Graduate study in the sciences, however, is a very unsentimental
education. It requires the intellectual evolution from undergrad
who can ace tests of textbook knowledge to original thinker who can
initiate and execute research about which the textbooks have yet to
be written.
 &HT;    What is less often acknowledged is that this intense education
involves an equally arduous psychological transition, almost a
second rebellious adolescence. The passage from callow,
eager-to-please first-year student in awe of an often-famous
faculty adviser to confident, independent-minded researcher willing
to challenge, and sometimes defy, a mentor is a requisite part of
the journey.
 &HT;    Harvard's Mallinckrodt Laboratory is one of the premier
factories for producing outstanding academic and industrial
chemists. The building stretches for an imposing length of Oxford
Street in Cambridge, its formal entrance flanked by stolid white
pillars, its double green doors topped by an entablature with all
the modesty of a Federal Reserve bank.
 &HT;    On its four floors, and in two adjoining buildings that form the
complex of chemistry buildings at Harvard, corridors open on
laboratory upon laboratory, reagents stacked on shelves, the
ventilated work areas known as hoods constantly sucking fumes away,
the entire building literally throbbing with ventilation.
 &HT;    There are 16 professors with lab groups in these buildings, in
organic and inorganic and physical chemistry, with expertise
ranging from the composition of the ozone hole to the enzymatic
reactions of creatures on the ocean floor. To people who have spent
enough time here, each group has its distinct smells (depending on
the chemistry being done) and each its distinct social tone
(depending on the personality and style of the lab chief).
 &HT;    At this level of achievement, there are no more A's for effort.
As a sign in one lab had it: ``Don't Try. Do.''
 &HT;    The young people who walk through those green doors enter a
world that has aspects both of a foreign country, with its own
language and customs, and of Dante's nine circles of hell, complete
with acrid odors and licking flames. In any given year, there are
roughly 350 young scientists _ half of them graduate students, half
postdoctoral fellows _ who toil in the buildings.
 &HT;    For the five or six years it typically takes to acquire a Ph.D.,
time is both a burden and a gift. Aside from taking classes their
first year, students have the freedom to pursue original research.
Their monthly stipends, after taxes, amount to little more than
$1,000 a month. They are expected to work 60 to 80 hours a week.
 &HT;    ``If it's felt that you're not working hard enough, you feel
that pressure more from the group than from your adviser,'' said
Reed Konsler, a fifth-year graduate student and co-chairman of the
chemistry department's Quality of Life Committee.
 &HT;    These pressures are not unique to Harvard. At the country's
other elite graduate chemistry programs _ at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, the University of California at Berkeley,
the California Institute of Technology, Stanford University and the
Scripps Research Institute _ the stresses are said to be
comparable, but according to some experts, they may be getting
worse.
 &HT;    ``The life of the graduate student is so pressured because the
future is so uncertain,'' said Dr. Edward M. Hallowell, a
psychiatrist who took courses in chemistry at Harvard as an
undergrad and is now on call to the university's chemistry
department. ``Whether you're a graduate student in English
literature or a graduate student in chemistry, there's no guarantee
that you're going to be able to find a job. And then you add the
self-imposed pressures of the students themselves. They want to win
a Nobel Prize yesterday.''
 &HT;    In some fields of chemistry, the job market has never been
better, but Hallowell argues that coping with the overall pressure
has become more difficult. ``I think the kind of supports that used
to be there for people aren't there anymore, like family and
extended family and community and religion, so you get more
isolation,'' he said, ``and isolation is the big enemy.''
 &HT;    Jason was exactly the kind of student Harvard and every other
top-notch science department looks for: bright, outgoing, likably
confident, intellectually mature, and with an inner reserve of
self-reliance that is indispensable to any researcher working on
the cutting edge.
 &HT;    He was born in Oak Ridge, Tenn., the son of Donald and Dianna
Altom. He attended the University of North Carolina with the intent
of studying business, according to friends, but graduated in 1993
as one of its most accomplished chemistry students ever.
 &HT;    With a long, narrow face and an engaging grin, he was known for
his good sense of humor, the methodical way in which he threw
himself into any task (including hobbies) and a taste for setting
the highest goals and challenges for himself and the unrelenting
drive to achieve them.
 &HT;    He was the kind of person who attended to every detail, no
matter how small, in both his science and his spare time: When
assigning friends to bring wine for one of the wine-tasting parties
he occasionally threw, he parenthetically provided the correct
pronunciation of ``chianti.''
 &HT;    By the beginning of 1994, after only four months of graduate
study, Jason chose the adviser he wanted to work with and was
accepted into the laboratory of E.J. Corey.
 &HT;    ``E.J. Corey is one of the most important chemists of our
century,'' says Peter Dervan of Caltech.
 &HT;    Born in Methuen, Mass., and educated at MIT, Corey is one of the
most prolific organic chemists of this century. His area of
specialty is synthetic organic chemistry _ that is, developing new
reactions and building naturally occurring chemical compounds from
scratch. In the course of a career whose productivity is almost
without precedent, he and the members of his lab have synthesized
more than 100 naturally occurring chemical compounds, many of them
with significant medical or industrial implications.
 &HT;    ``He was born brilliant and he'll die brilliant,'' says A.I.
Meyers of Colorado State University. ``I would rank him as one of
the two or three greatest scientists in the century, and the entire
pharmaceutical industry has been living off his chemistry for
years.'' The extended family of Corey group members has published,
by one estimation, a phenomenal 100,000 scientific papers.
 &HT;    Even his most unforgiving critics admit Corey is a gifted
chemist with great intuition, passionate about science above all
else, caring and loyal toward students who show the same passion;
but even his most unabashed admirers admit that his lab is an
intense place.
 &HT;    ``It is stressful,'' says K.C. Nicolaou, a chemistry professor
on the faculties of both the University of California at San Diego
and the Scripps Research Institute. ``To do a Ph.D., very
infrequently does one have a pleasant ride all the time. But I
would do it all over again with Corey. He's a great mentor.''
 &HT;    Meyers agrees: ``He is just an incredibly bright guy, and he
expects everyone around him to perform at a similar level.''
 &HT;    A stressful environment is, at some level, precisely the desired
effect: serving to separate those who have the emotional as well as
intellectual toughness to become scientists from those who don't.
 &HT;    The problem, according to a former graduate student who asked
not to be named, was that Corey cares so much that ``he doesn't
realize the emotional effects of his driving. When you're a
professor, you're not just doing research,'' this student said.
``You're dealing with people during a very difficult transition in
their lives. In the Corey lab, those things don't come into the
calculation. It's just chemistry.''
 &HT;    For his research project, Jason had chosen to synthesize a
molecule called haplophytine, which is, in the words of one lab
mate, ``an obscenely complex compound.'' His initial work had gone
exceedingly well, but on the Saturday he discovered a mistake,
Jason, extremely distraught, phoned his parents in Tennessee.
 &HT;    ``There was a clear concern that he had misidentified the
compound and had provided misleading information to Professor
Corey,'' Donald Altom said in an interview. ``He didn't know how to
discuss that with Professor Corey.'' He was so upset, according to
his parents, that they considered traveling immediately to
Cambridge, but when he seemed better during a phone call the
following Monday, Aug. 3, they felt that he was going to be OK.
 &HT;    At some point in his last two weeks, his friends now believe,
Jason's sense of self-worth became inextricably entangled with
solving that bond.
 &HT;    Corey, who finally consented to an interview after declining
several requests, like everyone else, insisted that he'd had no
idea of the depth of Jason's distress.
 &HT;    ``I would have done everything conceivable to help Jason if I
had had any inkling of his problem,'' Corey said in his plain,
soft-spoken voice. ``But I didn't. He was the last person in the
world I would have expected to commit suicide.''
 &HT;    We spoke in his spacious, sunny, book-lined office on the third
floor of Conant Lab, a plaque on one wall commemorating his Nobel
Prize and numerous sticklike models of chemical structures appended
like talismans to the bookshelves. When the subject was science, a
smile came quickly to his face, but when it turned to suicide, he
became guarded, his arms tightly crossed.
 &HT;    ``I feel badly that I didn't know more about Jason's background
and his day-to-day life,'' he admitted, and was able to recall, by
date and context, many of his extensive last conversations with
Jason, describing with evident pride his student's ``beautiful''
research.
 &HT;    ``If he had troubles, personal troubles,'' Corey said, ``why
wouldn't he seek help from me?''
 &HT;    One possible reason, I suggested, was the atmosphere of fear I
had encountered in the chemistry building. Almost every student I
interviewed was concerned about being quoted by name, and when I
asked why, the answer was always the same. They weren't sure how
their graduate advisers would take it, and it might affect their
careers.
 &HT;    Corey said he felt he had a partnership with his students that
overrode constraints in communication, but as even he admitted,
``Because lines of communication are there doesn't mean there will
be communication.''
 &HT;    In the end, despite all his scientific imagination and insight,
Corey was no less confused than anyone else. ``The more I think
about it,'' he said, ``the more helpless I feel to understand it.
It's beyond my comprehension.''

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    In death as in life, Jason Altom managed to be both extremely
methodical and extraordinarily good-hearted.
 &HT;    On the warm, humid day in mid-August when he ended his life, he
walked up to the third-floor bedroom of the Somerville, Mass.,
house he shared with two fellow graduate students at Harvard
University, drank a liquid laced with cyanide procured from the
very chemistry laboratory where he was considered an unusually
gifted student and lay down on his bed.
 &HT;    Having accounted for the remote possibility that his own death
might endanger others, the 26-year-old doctoral candidate left a
warning note on the bed.
 &HT;    ``Do Not Resuscitate,'' it read. ``Danger: Potassium Cyanide.''
 &HT;    As one of his roommates explained to me later, ``I think he was
worried, in his meticulous way, that someone might try to give him
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.''
 &HT;    It is not for that note, but rather for the three suicide notes
Jason left on the nightstand next to his bed, that his death has
had reverberations far beyond Harvard.
 &HT;    One was addressed to his parents, a second to the chairman of
Harvard's chemistry department and the third to his graduate
adviser, the Nobel laureate Elias J. Corey.
 &HT;    Work in the chemistry labs ground to a halt that weekend as word
of Jason's death swept through one after another of Harvard's 16
chem lab groups and then, by phone and E-mail, out into the
tightknit international community of chemists, some 600 of whom had
trained with Corey over the last half century.
 &HT;    Any suicide is shocking, but this one was especially so. Widely
known and well liked, Jason was by all accounts the golden boy of
the Corey group, perhaps the finest synthetic organic chemistry
laboratory anywhere in the world.
 &HT;    The following Monday morning, Corey, a vigorous 70-year-old,
delivered the devastating news to the department chairman, James G.
Anderson. ``He was just shocked and dismayed and heartbroken,''
Anderson said later. ``I had never seen him so distraught.''
 &HT;    Four weeks later, the Altom family shared with The Harvard
Crimson the contents of Jason's suicide note to the chemistry
department chairman. The paper published excerpts in its Sept. 14
issue.
 &HT;    ``This event could have been avoided,'' the note began.
``Professors here have too much power over the lives of their grad
students.'' The letter recommended adoption of a three-member
faculty committee to monitor each graduate student's progress and
``provide protection for graduate students from abusive research
advisers. If I had such a committee now I know things would be
different.''
 &HT;    It was the first time, a columnist for The Crimson observed
later, that a suicide note took the form of a policy memo.
 &HT;    Like a raw, angry Rorschach blot, the notes inspired different
interpretations in different quarters. Some graduates of Harvard's
chemistry program volunteered the opinion that Altom's letter
eerily and lucidly confirmed longstanding concerns about the
pressures of the Harvard chemistry program in general and the Corey
lab in particular.
 &HT;    As every ensuing bit of coverage dutifully noted, it was the
second suicide to hit the Corey group in less than two years and
the third since 1980. Others felt Corey was being unfairly
tarnished.
 &HT;    By the time I went up to Cambridge, the much-publicized suicide
had already inspired a number of changes, including the
three-member thesis committee suggested by Jason, a program of
lectures to stress alternative careers for Ph.D.s, more
opportunities for social interaction between students and free
confidential access to a therapist, with Harvard picking up the
tab. The suicide note, in short, had catalyzed major changes.
 &HT;    But as I began to speak with Jason's friends and colleagues, I
quickly learned that the situation was more complicated than the
notes had implied.
 &HT;    The people who knew Jason Altom best were as stunned and
confused by the anger of his letters, which Jason's family later
shared with them, as by his death. No one had had the slightest
inkling that Jason felt unfairly treated by his adviser _ not the
roommate who watched TV with him the night before his death, not
the postdoc with whom he shared a lab (and who marveled at the
amount of attention Jason received from Corey), not the six friends
with whom he socialized during his five years in Cambridge, not the
other roommate who furiously pedaled his bicycle home on a Saturday
morning in August when he'd been told that something terrible had
happened.
 &HT;    That roommate, Andrew Black, could imagine a burglary, a fire, a
calamity to another resident in the house, but never something to
do with Jason. ``I can't tell you how shocking it was,'' he said.
 &HT;    If Jason's death may not have had much to do with the incendiary
accusations contained in his letters, as many of his friends seemed
to suggest, it was nonetheless inextricably linked to the pressures
of graduate-school life _ not just at Harvard but at every
top-flight university where competitive overachievers aspire to
become scientists.
 &HT;    And if it were indeed an avoidable death, the reasons may have
less to do with the reforms already in place and more to do with
chemistry of a different sort _ not the textbook chemistry of
orbitals and bonds, but the more mysterious and nuanced kind
between two extremely bright human beings locked in a typically
intense graduate-school relationship.
 &HT;    Every year in October, when the Nobel Prizes in chemistry,
physics and medicine or physiology are announced, the predictable
parade of American honorees is reported on television and in the
papers with a combination of patriotic glee and almost total
befuddlement about the nature of the work being honored.
 &HT;    Hardly anyone pauses to think about the educational system that
has been so fabulously productive in turning out scientists in this
country. It is a system limited to about 120 research institutions,
and at the upper, rarefied reaches of that system are the elite
universities.
 &HT;    As James Anderson, chairman of Harvard's chemistry department,
puts it: ``The students here are spectacularly good, very bright,
very committed. They want to win Nobel Prizes, and some of them
will, and some of them want to do it before they're 30.''
 &HT;    Graduate study in the sciences, however, is a very unsentimental
education. It requires the intellectual evolution from undergrad
who can ace tests of textbook knowledge to original thinker who can
initiate and execute research about which the textbooks have yet to
be written.
 &HT;    What is less often acknowledged is that this intense education
involves an equally arduous psychological transition, almost a
second rebellious adolescence. The passage from callow,
eager-to-please first-year student in awe of an often-famous
faculty adviser to confident, independent-minded researcher willing
to challenge, and sometimes defy, a mentor is a requisite part of
the journey.
 &HT;    Harvard's Mallinckrodt Laboratory is one of the premier
factories for producing outstanding academic and industrial
chemists. The building stretches for an imposing length of Oxford
Street in Cambridge, its formal entrance flanked by stolid white
pillars, its double green doors topped by an entablature with all
the modesty of a Federal Reserve bank.
 &HT;    On its four floors, and in two adjoining buildings that form the
complex of chemistry buildings at Harvard, corridors open on
laboratory upon laboratory, reagents stacked on shelves, the
ventilated work areas known as hoods constantly sucking fumes away,
the entire building literally throbbing with ventilation.
 &HT;    There are 16 professors with lab groups in these buildings, in
organic and inorganic and physical chemistry, with expertise
ranging from the composition of the ozone hole to the enzymatic
reactions of creatures on the ocean floor. To people who have spent
enough time here, each group has its distinct smells (depending on
the chemistry being done) and each its distinct social tone
(depending on the personality and style of the lab chief).
 &HT;    At this level of achievement, there are no more A's for effort.
As a sign in one lab had it: ``Don't Try. Do.''
 &HT;    The young people who walk through those green doors enter a
world that has aspects both of a foreign country, with its own
language and customs, and of Dante's nine circles of hell, complete
with acrid odors and licking flames. In any given year, there are
roughly 350 young scientists _ half of them graduate students, half
postdoctoral fellows _ who toil in the buildings.
 &HT;    For the five or six years it typically takes to acquire a Ph.D.,
time is both a burden and a gift. Aside from taking classes their
first year, students have the freedom to pursue original research.
Their monthly stipends, after taxes, amount to little more than
$1,000 a month. They are expected to work 60 to 80 hours a week.
 &HT;    ``If it's felt that you're not working hard enough, you feel
that pressure more from the group than from your adviser,'' said
Reed Konsler, a fifth-year graduate student and co-chairman of the
chemistry department's Quality of Life Committee.
 &HT;    These pressures are not unique to Harvard. At the country's
other elite graduate chemistry programs _ at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, the University of California at Berkeley,
the California Institute of Technology, Stanford University and the
Scripps Research Institute _ the stresses are said to be
comparable, but according to some experts, they may be getting
worse.
 &HT;    ``The life of the graduate student is so pressured because the
future is so uncertain,'' said Dr. Edward M. Hallowell, a
psychiatrist who took courses in chemistry at Harvard as an
undergrad and is now on call to the university's chemistry
department. ``Whether you're a graduate student in English
literature or a graduate student in chemistry, there's no guarantee
that you're going to be able to find a job. And then you add the
self-imposed pressures of the students themselves. They want to win
a Nobel Prize yesterday.''
 &HT;    In some fields of chemistry, the job market has never been
better, but Hallowell argues that coping with the overall pressure
has become more difficult. ``I think the kind of supports that used
to be there for people aren't there anymore, like family and
extended family and community and religion, so you get more
isolation,'' he said, ``and isolation is the big enemy.''
 &HT;    Jason was exactly the kind of student Harvard and every other
top-notch science department looks for: bright, outgoing, likably
confident, intellectually mature, and with an inner reserve of
self-reliance that is indispensable to any researcher working on
the cutting edge.
 &HT;    He was born in Oak Ridge, Tenn., the son of Donald and Dianna
Altom. He attended the University of North Carolina with the intent
of studying business, according to friends, but graduated in 1993
as one of its most accomplished chemistry students ever.
 &HT;    With a long, narrow face and an engaging grin, he was known for
his good sense of humor, the methodical way in which he threw
himself into any task (including hobbies) and a taste for setting
the highest goals and challenges for himself and the unrelenting
drive to achieve them.
 &HT;    He was the kind of person who attended to every detail, no
matter how small, in both his science and his spare time: When
assigning friends to bring wine for one of the wine-tasting parties
he occasionally threw, he parenthetically provided the correct
pronunciation of ``chianti.''
 &HT;    By the beginning of 1994, after only four months of graduate
study, Jason chose the adviser he wanted to work with and was
accepted into the laboratory of E.J. Corey.
 &HT;    ``E.J. Corey is one of the most important chemists of our
century,'' says Peter Dervan of Caltech.
 &HT;    Born in Methuen, Mass., and educated at MIT, Corey is one of the
most prolific organic chemists of this century. His area of
specialty is synthetic organic chemistry _ that is, developing new
reactions and building naturally occurring chemical compounds from
scratch. In the course of a career whose productivity is almost
without precedent, he and the members of his lab have synthesized
more than 100 naturally occurring chemical compounds, many of them
with significant medical or industrial implications.
 &HT;    ``He was born brilliant and he'll die brilliant,'' says A.I.
Meyers of Colorado State University. ``I would rank him as one of
the two or three greatest scientists in the century, and the entire
pharmaceutical industry has been living off his chemistry for
years.'' The extended family of Corey group members has published,
by one estimation, a phenomenal 100,000 scientific papers.
 &HT;    Even his most unforgiving critics admit Corey is a gifted
chemist with great intuition, passionate about science above all
else, caring and loyal toward students who show the same passion;
but even his most unabashed admirers admit that his lab is an
intense place.
 &HT;    ``It is stressful,'' says K.C. Nicolaou, a chemistry professor
on the faculties of both the University of California at San Diego
and the Scripps Research Institute. ``To do a Ph.D., very
infrequently does one have a pleasant ride all the time. But I
would do it all over again with Corey. He's a great mentor.''
 &HT;    Meyers agrees: ``He is just an incredibly bright guy, and he
expects everyone around him to perform at a similar level.''
 &HT;    A stressful environment is, at some level, precisely the desired
effect: serving to separate those who have the emotional as well as
intellectual toughness to become scientists from those who don't.
 &HT;    The problem, according to a former graduate student who asked
not to be named, was that Corey cares so much that ``he doesn't
realize the emotional effects of his driving. When you're a
professor, you're not just doing research,'' this student said.
``You're dealing with people during a very difficult transition in
their lives. In the Corey lab, those things don't come into the
calculation. It's just chemistry.''
 &HT;    For his research project, Jason had chosen to synthesize a
molecule called haplophytine, which is, in the words of one lab
mate, ``an obscenely complex compound.'' His initial work had gone
exceedingly well, but on the Saturday he discovered a mistake,
Jason, extremely distraught, phoned his parents in Tennessee.
 &HT;    ``There was a clear concern that he had misidentified the
compound and had provided misleading information to Professor
Corey,'' Donald Altom said in an interview. ``He didn't know how to
discuss that with Professor Corey.'' He was so upset, according to
his parents, that they considered traveling immediately to
Cambridge, but when he seemed better during a phone call the
following Monday, Aug. 3, they felt that he was going to be OK.
 &HT;    At some point in his last two weeks, his friends now believe,
Jason's sense of self-worth became inextricably entangled with
solving that bond.
 &HT;    Corey, who finally consented to an interview after declining
several requests, like everyone else, insisted that he'd had no
idea of the depth of Jason's distress.
 &HT;    ``I would have done everything conceivable to help Jason if I
had had any inkling of his problem,'' Corey said in his plain,
soft-spoken voice. ``But I didn't. He was the last person in the
world I would have expected to commit suicide.''
 &HT;    We spoke in his spacious, sunny, book-lined office on the third
floor of Conant Lab, a plaque on one wall commemorating his Nobel
Prize and numerous sticklike models of chemical structures appended
like talismans to the bookshelves. When the subject was science, a
smile came quickly to his face, but when it turned to suicide, he
became guarded, his arms tightly crossed.
 &HT;    ``I feel badly that I didn't know more about Jason's background
and his day-to-day life,'' he admitted, and was able to recall, by
date and context, many of his extensive last conversations with
Jason, describing with evident pride his student's ``beautiful''
research.
 &HT;    ``If he had troubles, personal troubles,'' Corey said, ``why
wouldn't he seek help from me?''
 &HT;    One possible reason, I suggested, was the atmosphere of fear I
had encountered in the chemistry building. Almost every student I
interviewed was concerned about being quoted by name, and when I
asked why, the answer was always the same. They weren't sure how
their graduate advisers would take it, and it might affect their
careers.
 &HT;    Corey said he felt he had a partnership with his students that
overrode constraints in communication, but as even he admitted,
``Because lines of communication are there doesn't mean there will
be communication.''
 &HT;    In the end, despite all his scientific imagination and insight,
Corey was no less confused than anyone else. ``The more I think
about it,'' he said, ``the more helpless I feel to understand it.
It's beyond my comprehension.''

 By PAUL ELIE  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    When she died, a multitude came down to the old dwelling off the
Bowery to pay their respects, the way people had come to Catholic
Worker houses for soup ever since the Depression. There were
Catholic Workers, social workers, migrant workers, the unemployed;
addicts, alcoholics, anarchists; Protestants, Jews and agnostics;
the devout and the strident and the curious, there to see what a
saint looked like.
 &HT;    Dorothy Day died in 1980, at the age of 83. She was one of the
greatest religious figures of the century, and one of the most
paradoxical. She was a Catholic and she was an anarchist. She
condemned poverty and she advocated it.
 &HT;    She founded the Catholic Worker, a loose aggregation of ``houses
of hospitality,'' communal farms, newspapers and round-table
discussions for ``further clarification of thought'' _ and called
her memoirs ``The Long Loneliness.'' The movement was wary of
authority, yet revered her as its leader. She humbled herself
before God and sat for a portrait by Richard Avedon.
 &HT;    ``Don't call me a saint _ I don't want to be dismissed that
easily,'' she once said, to no avail. A year ago, to mark what
would have been her 100th birthday (Nov. 8 would have been her
101st), John Cardinal O'Connor of New York, a lifelong admirer,
announced that he would take up the cause for her canonization.
``If anybody in our time can be called a saint, she can,'' he said.
 &HT;    It was an honor, and it was another paradox. For the prospect
that Dorothy Day might be declared a saint was welcomed by
everybody except the Catholic Workers, the very people pledged to
emulate her sanctity today.
 &HT;    The old-time Catholic Workers who were close to Day support the
canonization effort wholeheartedly. But many Workers, especially
the younger ones, see the church remaking a rebel for its own
purposes, and find her synthesis of rock-ribbed Catholicism and
radical politics impossible to attain today.
 &HT;    They find it twisted that Day, a pacifist who opposed even World
War II, should be celebrated by Rear Adm. John J. O'Connor,
retired, a former head chaplain to the U.S. Navy. They object to
his notion that Day _ who became a Catholic after having an
abortion _ could become a poster saint for the church's
anti-abortion efforts.
 &HT;    ``People feel that Dorothy's too good for the church, and are
afraid of what will happen once the church gets its mitts on her,''
says Robert Ellsberg, a former Catholic Worker, now the editor in
chief of Orbis Books, a progressive Catholic press.
 &HT;    When Day's sainthood was first brought up 15 years ago, one of
her nine granddaughters called the idea ``sick.''
 &HT;    Then the high priest of the Catholic left weighed in. ``Her
spirit haunts us in the violated faces of the homeless in New
York,'' Daniel Berrigan wrote. ``Can you imagine her portrait, all
gussied up, unfurled from above the high altar of St. Peter's?''
 &HT;    The conflict has since taken shape as a battle over property,
with the Workers claiming squatter's rights to Day's legacy while
the church exercises its power of eminent domain. Those in favor of
sainthood depict her as ``a loyal servant of the church Jesus had
founded'' (her words) who prayed the rosary on the barricades.
 &HT;    Those opposed are afraid the Vatican's saint-making priests will
evict her from the underworld of tenements, flophouses, rallies and
jails and recast her as the Patron Saint of Soup Kitchens, a
kindhearted woman who dabbled in anarchism on the side.
 &HT;    ``They're going to take the best of Dorothy and remove it, like
a lobotomy,'' says Jeff Dietrich, a Catholic Worker in Los Angeles.
 &HT;    Saints, in the Catholic tradition, are holy people who call
forth the devotion of the faithful, even after they are dead. Since
becoming pope in 1978, John Paul II has canonized 280 saints, more
than any previous pope. And the Vatican has simplified the process,
reducing from four to two the number of miracles needed (say, the
inexplicable cure of a person who prayed for the saint's aid) and
doing away with the ``devil's advocate,'' who argued against the
prospective saint's cause.
 &HT;    Why so many saints? John Paul doubtless has a number of
objectives. The new saints reflect the worldwide presence of the
church and stand in contrast to the modern cult of the self. But
mainly they embody John Paul's view of history. Whereas many popes
have seen the church as above or outside of history, he sees the
church in the thick of it. So he has made saints of people who made
history, however controversially.
 &HT;    In October, for example, when he canonized Edith Stein, a Jewish
philosopher who converted to Catholicism, became a nun, then was
killed as a Jew at Auschwitz, he affirmed _ defying scruple _ in
effect that the church was on the right side of history during the
Holocaust, suffering with the Jewish people.
 &HT;    The ensuing controversy hung on whether Stein died as a Catholic
or as a Jew. The controversy over Day is different. Nobody would
deny that she was a Catholic, and most people think she was a
saint, even those who care little for the church. What complicates
matters is that these people don't agree about what it was that
made her saintly.
 &HT;    The tussle over her legacy is no simple tug-of-war between the
Catholic left and the Roman right. It involves a range of
conceptions of what it means to be Catholic, and the one that
prevails very likely will be the prevailing form of Catholicism in
the next century.
 &HT;    O'Connor went to Rome in September, taking a sheaf of
recollections of Day written by her old friends. Meanwhile, in
flats and tumbledown farmhouses and ``houses of hospitality,''
Catholic Workers are watching his every move. Their friend and
foundress is their pearl of great price. Each day she passes
further out of their hands and into those of the church. If they
are a touch possessive, who can blame them?
 &HT;    Before she was a saint, Day was a bohemian in Greenwich Village,
drinking all night and wandering into strange churches at dawn. She
rallied for the masses, went to jail, married on the rebound, wrote
a novel, fell in love and bore a child, all before she abruptly
became a Catholic at age 30 in 1927. Her lover scorned her. So did
her radical friends.
 &HT;    Twice a year, the patrons of the Radical New York Walking Tour
pause at St. Joseph House on East First Street to hear this story
of Dorothy Day.
 &HT;    One afternoon in 1932 she returned home to find Peter Maurin, a
French ``troubadour of God,'' waiting for her. They founded the
Catholic Worker there and then.
 &HT;    Day called her Catholic Worker column ``On Pilgrimage,'' and she
crisscrossed the country by bus to visit Catholic Worker houses,
taking her breviary, her diary and a jar of instant coffee. She
went to Cuba to meet Castro and to Rome to fast in St. Peter's
Square for peace, yet was so identified with the Lower East Side
that people would invariably show up at St. Joseph House and expect
her to greet them at the door.
 &HT;    The house still looks the way it did when Day was in charge,
furnished with beat-up chairs and a cast-iron stove out of a Grimm
tale. A pot of coffee brews perpetually. The movement names no
leaders; in New York, the closest thing is Carmen Trotta, a
musclebound 35-year-old man with thick brown hair.
 &HT;    He and I set out to join a few old-time Workers for further
clarification of thought at a local bar. ``In the old days,'' he
says, ``the Workers would stand on the corner selling copies of the
paper until they had enough change for a drink. You'd have to sell
an awful lot of papers today.''
 &HT;    The Catholic Worker newspaper still costs a penny a copy. It is
still a broad sheet full of articles about labor, politics and the
life of faith, with a statement of ``Aims and Means'': yes to
``personalism,'' manual labor and a green revolution, no to usury
and bureaucracy. But the subject between the lines is change.
 &HT;    While Day and Maurin aspired to ``build a new society within the
shell of the old,'' today a new society is being built in the shell
of the old Lower East Side. Galleries and boutiques have replaced
the junk shops and flophouses. The Workers used to serve 300 meals
a day; now they serve half as many.
 &HT;    Some people have suggested that the Catholic Workers have
outlived their mission in the Village, but they are there to stay,
questioning change. How should they respond to gentrification _ by
protesting, by homesteading or by founding a satellite house in the
Bronx? Should they welcome Ivy League volunteers who want to pad
their resumes, or insist on poverty as a way of life?
 &HT;    These questions are usually answered through further
clarification of thought. So Trotta spends many hours with the
old-timers asking them what Dorothy would have done.
 &HT;    Yet Day's refusal to institutionalize the movement has left
Catholic Worker houses elsewhere free to experiment. Unity Kitchen
Committee in Syracuse offers ``lavish hospitality'' _ dinner with
china, cutlery and fresh flowers _ as a response to Day's adage
that ``nothing is too good for the poor.'' Casa Juan Diego in
Houston provides English classes, sanctuary for illegal aliens,
first aid for battered women and coffins for the dead.
 &HT;    After the Archdiocese of Los Angeles announced plans to build a
new cathedral _ estimated cost, $163 million _ Catholic Workers
broke into the old one and hung a banner out the bell tower: ``We
Reclaim the Church for the Poor.''
 &HT;    So it is no great surprise that the Catholic Workers have as
many ways of being Catholic as of serving soup. A house in
California sponsored ``a gay marriage'' (the two men later
``divorced''), and one in Denver held a mock Mass led by some
Sisters of Loreto. ``There are some crazy joints out there, some
things that would turn a bishop's hair a little whiter,'' says Tom
Cornell, an old Worker who now lives at Peter Maurin Farm in
upstate New York.
 &HT;    How vital is the Catholic faith to the Catholic Worker's
mission? Ann O'Connor of Unity Kitchen thinks the Worker must be
more faithful to the church. Jeff Dietrich thinks the church must
become more like the Worker, strengthening its ``prophetic
dimension'' through street protests.
 &HT;    And while Mark and Louise Zwick of Casa Juan Diego in Houston
think prayer and worship are as vital as rice and beans (when
supplies run low, they pray), the Workers at St. Francis of Assisi
House in Chicago say that they are first and foremost anarchists.
 &HT;    The Catholic Worker is Catholic, but it is unsure how or why.
Its members hold beliefs ranging from traditionalism to the radical
fringe, with each deciding for himself or herself what the faith
is. It is like the Catholic Church throughout the United States,
that is, and the question _ in the movement, and in the church _ is
whether this diversity is a form of strength or a kind of religious
decadence.
 &HT;    ``Dorothy Day was a romantic of poverty _ she saw poverty as a
sign of God's presence,'' says Francis Cardinal George, the new
archbishop of Chicago. ``Her view is important. It will always be
important. But it will always be on the fringes of the church as a
corrective, not as mainstream Catholicism. Anarchy is not
mainstream Catholicism.''
 &HT;    And one would expect this view from a traditional Catholic
churchman, celebrating a holy woman for her fidelity to the church.
 &HT;    Indeed, Day must be held up as an ordinary, decent Catholic whom
the people in the pews can emulate, even as they vote their
pocketbooks. ``For Catholic Workers, the soup line is the think
tank and the seminar room,'' says Patrick Jordan, an editor of
Commonweal and a former Catholic Worker. ``That's where you make
policy.''
 &HT;    When Day became pregnant in 1919, the father threatened to leave
her unless she aborted the child. She did so, but he left her
anyway. When she became pregnant again, this time by a man she
loved, ``I knew that I was going to have my baby baptized a
Catholic, cost what it may,'' she said. It cost her her lover. Her
conversion followed.
 &HT;    Today, while many, even most, Catholic Workers see abortion as
an act of violence that must be resisted, they see the church's
campaign against legal abortion as an attempt to enlist the state
to enforce holiness.
 &HT;    When USA Today reported O'Connor's remark that Day might become
``the patron saint of the pro-life movement,'' many Workers were
alarmed.
 &HT;    At a meeting in Nashua, N.H., an old Worker named Jack Cook rose
in his chair and denounced the plan as ``a form of spiritual
abuse.'' He was applauded. ``She could have, at any time, come out
publicly and politically against abortion,'' Cook explained. ``She
did not. ... When she spoke of abortion, it was in terms of
forgiveness, not criminality.''
 &HT;    Day's response to abortion is crucial to the canonization
process because she is a role model for thousands of Catholic women
in the United States, an American Mother Teresa. The two figures _
who met in India in 1970 _ are often cast as the two archetypes of
contemporary Catholic activism: one a nun who stressed charity, the
other a lay woman who called for justice.
 &HT;    In a talk last year, though, the Jesuit priest Thomas Reese
stressed what they had in common _ not as women but as devout
Catholics who had devoted themselves to fixing the world rather
than reforming the church.
 &HT;    Reese went on to ask why so many Catholics are bent on the
latter, why the conflicts among Catholics often seem like quarrels
over a brand name, with the players so worked up over what it means
to be Catholic that they lose sight of the holy.
 &HT;    The obvious reason is that the church stands in need of reform.
But there are reasons behind the reasons. It may be that the
Catholic leaders who would confront society _ the Mother Teresas
and Dorothy Days _ are in short supply.
 &HT;    The experts expatiate on the shortage of priests, but the real
shortage is of authentic Catholic leaders of any kind _ of the
saints among the living, that is.

 By PAUL ELIE  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    When she died, a multitude came down to the old dwelling off the
Bowery to pay their respects, the way people had come to Catholic
Worker houses for soup ever since the Depression. There were
Catholic Workers, social workers, migrant workers, the unemployed;
addicts, alcoholics, anarchists; Protestants, Jews and agnostics;
the devout and the strident and the curious, there to see what a
saint looked like.
 &HT;    Dorothy Day died in 1980, at the age of 83. She was one of the
greatest religious figures of the century, and one of the most
paradoxical. She was a Catholic and she was an anarchist. She
condemned poverty and she advocated it.
 &HT;    She founded the Catholic Worker, a loose aggregation of ``houses
of hospitality,'' communal farms, newspapers and round-table
discussions for ``further clarification of thought'' _ and called
her memoirs ``The Long Loneliness.'' The movement was wary of
authority, yet revered her as its leader. She humbled herself
before God and sat for a portrait by Richard Avedon.
 &HT;    ``Don't call me a saint _ I don't want to be dismissed that
easily,'' she once said, to no avail. A year ago, to mark what
would have been her 100th birthday (Nov. 8 would have been her
101st), John Cardinal O'Connor of New York, a lifelong admirer,
announced that he would take up the cause for her canonization.
``If anybody in our time can be called a saint, she can,'' he said.
 &HT;    It was an honor, and it was another paradox. For the prospect
that Dorothy Day might be declared a saint was welcomed by
everybody except the Catholic Workers, the very people pledged to
emulate her sanctity today.
 &HT;    The old-time Catholic Workers who were close to Day support the
canonization effort wholeheartedly. But many Workers, especially
the younger ones, see the church remaking a rebel for its own
purposes, and find her synthesis of rock-ribbed Catholicism and
radical politics impossible to attain today.
 &HT;    They find it twisted that Day, a pacifist who opposed even World
War II, should be celebrated by Rear Adm. John J. O'Connor,
retired, a former head chaplain to the U.S. Navy. They object to
his notion that Day _ who became a Catholic after having an
abortion _ could become a poster saint for the church's
anti-abortion efforts.
 &HT;    ``People feel that Dorothy's too good for the church, and are
afraid of what will happen once the church gets its mitts on her,''
says Robert Ellsberg, a former Catholic Worker, now the editor in
chief of Orbis Books, a progressive Catholic press.
 &HT;    When Day's sainthood was first brought up 15 years ago, one of
her nine granddaughters called the idea ``sick.''
 &HT;    Then the high priest of the Catholic left weighed in. ``Her
spirit haunts us in the violated faces of the homeless in New
York,'' Daniel Berrigan wrote. ``Can you imagine her portrait, all
gussied up, unfurled from above the high altar of St. Peter's?''
 &HT;    The conflict has since taken shape as a battle over property,
with the Workers claiming squatter's rights to Day's legacy while
the church exercises its power of eminent domain. Those in favor of
sainthood depict her as ``a loyal servant of the church Jesus had
founded'' (her words) who prayed the rosary on the barricades.
 &HT;    Those opposed are afraid the Vatican's saint-making priests will
evict her from the underworld of tenements, flophouses, rallies and
jails and recast her as the Patron Saint of Soup Kitchens, a
kindhearted woman who dabbled in anarchism on the side.
 &HT;    ``They're going to take the best of Dorothy and remove it, like
a lobotomy,'' says Jeff Dietrich, a Catholic Worker in Los Angeles.
 &HT;    Saints, in the Catholic tradition, are holy people who call
forth the devotion of the faithful, even after they are dead. Since
becoming pope in 1978, John Paul II has canonized 280 saints, more
than any previous pope. And the Vatican has simplified the process,
reducing from four to two the number of miracles needed (say, the
inexplicable cure of a person who prayed for the saint's aid) and
doing away with the ``devil's advocate,'' who argued against the
prospective saint's cause.
 &HT;    Why so many saints? John Paul doubtless has a number of
objectives. The new saints reflect the worldwide presence of the
church and stand in contrast to the modern cult of the self. But
mainly they embody John Paul's view of history. Whereas many popes
have seen the church as above or outside of history, he sees the
church in the thick of it. So he has made saints of people who made
history, however controversially.
 &HT;    In October, for example, when he canonized Edith Stein, a Jewish
philosopher who converted to Catholicism, became a nun, then was
killed as a Jew at Auschwitz, he affirmed _ defying scruple _ in
effect that the church was on the right side of history during the
Holocaust, suffering with the Jewish people.
 &HT;    The ensuing controversy hung on whether Stein died as a Catholic
or as a Jew. The controversy over Day is different. Nobody would
deny that she was a Catholic, and most people think she was a
saint, even those who care little for the church. What complicates
matters is that these people don't agree about what it was that
made her saintly.
 &HT;    The tussle over her legacy is no simple tug-of-war between the
Catholic left and the Roman right. It involves a range of
conceptions of what it means to be Catholic, and the one that
prevails very likely will be the prevailing form of Catholicism in
the next century.
 &HT;    O'Connor went to Rome in September, taking a sheaf of
recollections of Day written by her old friends. Meanwhile, in
flats and tumbledown farmhouses and ``houses of hospitality,''
Catholic Workers are watching his every move. Their friend and
foundress is their pearl of great price. Each day she passes
further out of their hands and into those of the church. If they
are a touch possessive, who can blame them?
 &HT;    Before she was a saint, Day was a bohemian in Greenwich Village,
drinking all night and wandering into strange churches at dawn. She
rallied for the masses, went to jail, married on the rebound, wrote
a novel, fell in love and bore a child, all before she abruptly
became a Catholic at age 30 in 1927. Her lover scorned her. So did
her radical friends.
 &HT;    Twice a year, the patrons of the Radical New York Walking Tour
pause at St. Joseph House on East First Street to hear this story
of Dorothy Day.
 &HT;    One afternoon in 1932 she returned home to find Peter Maurin, a
French ``troubadour of God,'' waiting for her. They founded the
Catholic Worker there and then.
 &HT;    Day called her Catholic Worker column ``On Pilgrimage,'' and she
crisscrossed the country by bus to visit Catholic Worker houses,
taking her breviary, her diary and a jar of instant coffee. She
went to Cuba to meet Castro and to Rome to fast in St. Peter's
Square for peace, yet was so identified with the Lower East Side
that people would invariably show up at St. Joseph House and expect
her to greet them at the door.
 &HT;    The house still looks the way it did when Day was in charge,
furnished with beat-up chairs and a cast-iron stove out of a Grimm
tale. A pot of coffee brews perpetually. The movement names no
leaders; in New York, the closest thing is Carmen Trotta, a
musclebound 35-year-old man with thick brown hair.
 &HT;    He and I set out to join a few old-time Workers for further
clarification of thought at a local bar. ``In the old days,'' he
says, ``the Workers would stand on the corner selling copies of the
paper until they had enough change for a drink. You'd have to sell
an awful lot of papers today.''
 &HT;    The Catholic Worker newspaper still costs a penny a copy. It is
still a broad sheet full of articles about labor, politics and the
life of faith, with a statement of ``Aims and Means'': yes to
``personalism,'' manual labor and a green revolution, no to usury
and bureaucracy. But the subject between the lines is change.
 &HT;    While Day and Maurin aspired to ``build a new society within the
shell of the old,'' today a new society is being built in the shell
of the old Lower East Side. Galleries and boutiques have replaced
the junk shops and flophouses. The Workers used to serve 300 meals
a day; now they serve half as many.
 &HT;    Some people have suggested that the Catholic Workers have
outlived their mission in the Village, but they are there to stay,
questioning change. How should they respond to gentrification _ by
protesting, by homesteading or by founding a satellite house in the
Bronx? Should they welcome Ivy League volunteers who want to pad
their resumes, or insist on poverty as a way of life?
 &HT;    These questions are usually answered through further
clarification of thought. So Trotta spends many hours with the
old-timers asking them what Dorothy would have done.
 &HT;    Yet Day's refusal to institutionalize the movement has left
Catholic Worker houses elsewhere free to experiment. Unity Kitchen
Committee in Syracuse offers ``lavish hospitality'' _ dinner with
china, cutlery and fresh flowers _ as a response to Day's adage
that ``nothing is too good for the poor.'' Casa Juan Diego in
Houston provides English classes, sanctuary for illegal aliens,
first aid for battered women and coffins for the dead.
 &HT;    After the Archdiocese of Los Angeles announced plans to build a
new cathedral _ estimated cost, $163 million _ Catholic Workers
broke into the old one and hung a banner out the bell tower: ``We
Reclaim the Church for the Poor.''
 &HT;    So it is no great surprise that the Catholic Workers have as
many ways of being Catholic as of serving soup. A house in
California sponsored ``a gay marriage'' (the two men later
``divorced''), and one in Denver held a mock Mass led by some
Sisters of Loreto. ``There are some crazy joints out there, some
things that would turn a bishop's hair a little whiter,'' says Tom
Cornell, an old Worker who now lives at Peter Maurin Farm in
upstate New York.
 &HT;    How vital is the Catholic faith to the Catholic Worker's
mission? Ann O'Connor of Unity Kitchen thinks the Worker must be
more faithful to the church. Jeff Dietrich thinks the church must
become more like the Worker, strengthening its ``prophetic
dimension'' through street protests.
 &HT;    And while Mark and Louise Zwick of Casa Juan Diego in Houston
think prayer and worship are as vital as rice and beans (when
supplies run low, they pray), the Workers at St. Francis of Assisi
House in Chicago say that they are first and foremost anarchists.
 &HT;    The Catholic Worker is Catholic, but it is unsure how or why.
Its members hold beliefs ranging from traditionalism to the radical
fringe, with each deciding for himself or herself what the faith
is. It is like the Catholic Church throughout the United States,
that is, and the question _ in the movement, and in the church _ is
whether this diversity is a form of strength or a kind of religious
decadence.
 &HT;    ``Dorothy Day was a romantic of poverty _ she saw poverty as a
sign of God's presence,'' says Francis Cardinal George, the new
archbishop of Chicago. ``Her view is important. It will always be
important. But it will always be on the fringes of the church as a
corrective, not as mainstream Catholicism. Anarchy is not
mainstream Catholicism.''
 &HT;    And one would expect this view from a traditional Catholic
churchman, celebrating a holy woman for her fidelity to the church.
 &HT;    Indeed, Day must be held up as an ordinary, decent Catholic whom
the people in the pews can emulate, even as they vote their
pocketbooks. ``For Catholic Workers, the soup line is the think
tank and the seminar room,'' says Patrick Jordan, an editor of
Commonweal and a former Catholic Worker. ``That's where you make
policy.''
 &HT;    When Day became pregnant in 1919, the father threatened to leave
her unless she aborted the child. She did so, but he left her
anyway. When she became pregnant again, this time by a man she
loved, ``I knew that I was going to have my baby baptized a
Catholic, cost what it may,'' she said. It cost her her lover. Her
conversion followed.
 &HT;    Today, while many, even most, Catholic Workers see abortion as
an act of violence that must be resisted, they see the church's
campaign against legal abortion as an attempt to enlist the state
to enforce holiness.
 &HT;    When USA Today reported O'Connor's remark that Day might become
``the patron saint of the pro-life movement,'' many Workers were
alarmed.
 &HT;    At a meeting in Nashua, N.H., an old Worker named Jack Cook rose

But there are reasons behind the reasons. It may be that the

 &HT;    The experts expatiate on the shortage of priests, but the real
shortage is of authentic Catholic leaders of any kind _ of the
saints among the living, that is.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    A single photograph decorates the office walls of Triangle
Contractors in an old house on Cortelyou Road in Brooklyn. It
depicts a young man with a Kalashnikov slung across his chest, a
pistol tucked into his belt and another automatic weapon in his
hands.
 &HT;    It is a rainy day several months before the peace agreement in
Kosovo, and I have come to find out about the Kosovo Liberation
Army, the ethnic-Albanian guerrilla movement fighting for
independence from Serbia.
 &HT;    Nobody seems to know how the group started or who is in charge
of it, but word among Albanians in New York is that Triangle's
owner, Florin Krasniqi, is one of its principal fund-raisers.
 &HT;    The 34-year-old contractor has a muscular build, dark, serious
eyes and a no-nonsense manner. He is friendly, but it is clear he
has things to do and talking to me is not one of his priorities. I
ask if he raises money for the guerrilla army.
 &HT;    ``I thought you knew that,'' he says matter-of-factly. He hands
me an Albanian newspaper, ``Zeri i Kosoves,'' The Voice of Kosovo,
which has an ad for a ``Homeland Calling'' fund that lists accounts
in the United States, Switzerland, Germany, Australia, Austria,
Norway, Denmark, France, Sweden, Italy, Belgium and Canada.
 &HT;    A mobile phone rings, and even though he speaks in Albanian, I
sense that the news is not good.
 &HT;    ``The Serbs seized a convoy of our weapons,'' he says, looking
down for a second before looking up with a mischievous smile.
``They didn't kill any of our guys, though. They were waiting for
us. We walked right into their trap, and they didn't manage to kill
one of our guys, not a single one!'' He brushes off the incident as
a minor setback.
 &HT;    Florin has been a leading supporter of the KLA for nearly three
years, helping raise between $12 million and $15 million while
changing a once-obscure clutch of rural militants into an
insurgency. His business has suffered as a result, forcing him to
cut down from 32 employees to 10.
 &HT;    But that's no longer his primary concern. Under U.S. law, a
citizen may legally aid a foreign army as long as it is not
considered a terrorist organization by the State Department. The
KLA is not, so Florin is confident that he is doing the right
thing, morally and legally.
 &HT;    The rebel army is amorphous, Hydra-headed, disorganized and
plagued with infighting. It is certainly no match for Serbian Army
and police forces. But the KLA has put Kosovo, a tiny province of
fewer than 2 million people, at the top of the international
agenda.
 &HT;    Even though the Western powers are united with Serbia in
opposing an independent Kosovo, nobody seems able to dissuade the
rebels from their goal. The KLA is like a chronic infection that
periodically flares and subsides; it is unruly, persistent,
seemingly indefatigable.
 &HT;    Florin points to the photograph on the wall. ``Did you see the
picture of my cousin Adrian?'' It's a rhetorical question _ the
photograph is impossible to miss _ so Florin doesn't wait for an
answer. ``He was one of the first KLA fighters to die. I'm doing
this for him.''
 &HT;    While Kosovo has drawn a lot of attention lately, the conflict
dates to 1989 when Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav president,
revoked Kosovo's autonomy within the Yugoslav federation, fired
Albanians from state-run institutions and banned teaching of the
Albanian language and literature.
 &HT;    Long a part of Serbia, Kosovo had become increasingly populated
by ethnic Albanians _ and deserted by Serbs, who left in droves for
the more comfortable surroundings of Serbia proper. By 1989, the
population was 90 percent ethnic Albanian, assuring that
Milosevic's decree would stir widespread resentment. Ultimately,
that coalesced in the murky form of the KLA.
 &HT;    Florin and his extended family began their revolutionary
activity in 1995. At the time, Adrian was a 23-year-old engineering
student with wholesome good looks and a masterful chess game. In
March, after one of his friends was killed by the Serbian police,
he tried to organize a student demonstration. He was stopped, not
by the Serbs but by his fellow Albanians.
 &HT;    Ibrahim Rugova, the Kosovar political leader, feared _
correctly, as subsequent events would bear out _ that active
resistance would provoke a Serbian crackdown.
 &HT;    Adrian protested Rugova's decision, circulating a petition that
was signed by 900 students. When the Serbian police found out, he
was arrested, locked in a dark cell and beaten unconscious. Upon
his release, he fled to Albania to buy a gun. When he returned
three months later, he killed his first Serbian cop.
 &HT;    ``I was furious about it,'' Florin says. ``I tried to get him to
calm down, but Adrian was stubborn. He said he wouldn't stop until
we were liberated.''
 &HT;    That was back when Florin still believed in the politics of
peace. A former geometry teacher, he left Kosovo in 1989 as part of
a wave of more than half a million refugees who sought political
asylum abroad, principally in Germany and the United States.
Eventually he found his way to Brooklyn.
 &HT;    Like many of his compatriots in the diaspora, Florin donated 3
percent of his income to Rugova's political party and kept his
faith that the Albanians would be rewarded by the West for their
peaceful struggle.
 &HT;    But at the end of 1995, Florin snapped. ``It was Dayton,'' he
says. The Dayton peace accord ended the war in Bosnia, but left the
status of Kosovo unresolved.
 &HT;    Every other disgruntled minority in Yugoslavia _ the Slovenes,
the Croats, the Bosnians _ fought for independence and got it, he
says. The Albanians took the peaceful road and were ignored.
``That's when I realized fighting was the only way. Peaceful
resistance brought us nothing.''
 &HT;    He started small, sending two-way radios, flashlights,
camouflage uniforms, bulletproof vests. But after Adrian was killed
during an attack on a police station in October 1997, he decided to
dedicate his life to the KLA.
 &HT;    ``It wasn't easy raising money at first,'' he says. The
estimated 300,000 Kosovar refugees in the United States _ clustered
mainly in New York, Detroit, Chicago and Boston _ supported Rugova.
``Things have changed now,'' Florin says in April. ''Everyone
realizes Rugova is not the answer. The money is coming in so fast
that we don't know what to do with it.''
 &HT;    While exact figures are hard to come by, refugee groups claim to
have raised in excess of $100 million to support Rugova and, now,
the armed resistance.
 -0- 
 &HT;    I fly to Albania to meet Florin's family and see where the money
is going. Bajram Curri, in the desolate and lawless north of
Albania, sits on the edge of the Sar Mountains. Even at the end of
June, snow still lies deep on the 8,000-foot peaks that overlook
the villages of Kosovo.
 &HT;    The eight-hour trek there from Tirana, the Albanian capital,
involves three legs _ five hours on a narrow, winding road, two
hours on a ferry and another hour by car. The ferry runs once a
day, snaking its way along the turquoise Drin River between jagged
cliffs. The scenery is spectacular, but the beauty seems lost on
most of the passengers, who are preoccupied with their livestock
and weapons. Chickens, goats and cows are crammed in between vans
and trucks loaded with guns.
 &HT;    Poverty in northern Albania rivals that of undeveloped Africa.
The villagers of Bajram Curri still use the barter system, and most
of their energy goes into fulfilling the basic needs of food and
shelter. Blood feuds are the law of the land _ children live
indoors for fear of being gunned down if they set foot outside. The
lack of formal institutions means the only things that really
matter in Bajram Curri are how big you are, how many guns you have
and whom you know.
 &HT;    Besnik Krasniqi, Florin's uncle, is big, well armed and knows
everybody. I find him sitting in a cafe on the town's main
boulevard. He is a burly man in his mid-50s with a massive belly
and Florin's mischievous smile. He and his family were isolated
from the rest of the Krasniqi clan in Kosovo.
 &HT;    I introduce myself to Besnik and tell him Florin sent me. When I
say I would like to visit a KLA training camp, he eyes me
suspiciously. ``Nobody is supposed to see the training camps,''
Besnik says. ``But if Florin says it's OK, you will be able to do
everything.'' We agree to call Florin by satellite telephone.
 &HT;    Besnik's house is full of KLA soldiers, Kosovars who have
recently returned from Germany, Switzerland and the United States
to fight. Stacks of ammunition boxes clutter his courtyard, and
pistols and rifles are strewn around inside. Besnik's wife and
daughter spend their days cooking for the soldiers.
 &HT;    His two sons, who have returned from studying in Switzerland and
Pakistan, shuttle soldiers and guns in his two four-wheel-drives.
Six Albanians from Alaska have just arrived with a briefcase of
cash they raised among Alaska's 300-strong Albanian community. They
are sunburned and complaining about the heat, which even in the
evenings is stultifying.
 &HT;    When I manage to reach Florin by phone in Brooklyn, I tell him I
am at Besnik's house. ``That's where everything started,'' he says.
``On the second floor.''
 &HT;    Back in 1996, soon after Florin started sending supplies to
Adrian, the Serbian police accused Adrian of terrorism. To avoid
arrest, he fled across the border to Albania, where he moved in
with Besnik and ran small quantities of arms over the border to
Kosovo.
 &HT;    So things stayed until early in 1997, when the Krasniqi boys hit
the jackpot. A string of fraudulent pyramid-type investment schemes
collapsed in Albania, bilking thousands of average people out of
their life savings. In the violent antigovernment demonstrations
that followed, people stormed military arms depots, taking anything
they could get their hands on.
 &HT;    Suddenly, there were guns everywhere, and it didn't take all
that much money to accumulate a sizable cache of arms. ``You could
walk up to a fruit stand and behind the watermelons there would be
weapons,'' Florin says.
 &HT;    ``Kalashnikovs were going for $10 each. The villagers were
giving us ammunition for free.'' As the motherland imploded, the
Krasniqis quietly collected all the arms they could and stored them
in a farmhouse, which became the KLA's rear base. Adrian meanwhile,
began moving weapons across the border to Kosovo with convoys of
horses and mules.
 &HT;    ``I had to show him how to pack a horse,'' Florin laughs. ``He
probably would have kept carrying the guns himself.''
 &HT;    But in October 1997 Adrian was shot and killed. Serbian
television repeatedly showed Adrian's corpse with a grenade in his
hand, instantly transforming him into a martyr for Kosovo's
independence movement. An estimated 13,000 people attended his
funeral.
 &HT;    The poster of him with his AK-47 and battle fatigues _ the same
one that decorates the wall in Florin's Brooklyn office _ became a
fixture in Albanian homes and the centerpiece of a suddenly potent
KLA fund-raising effort.
 &HT;    From Brooklyn, Florin explains that the old camp is gone but
that the KLA has set up a new base that I can visit. I hand the
phone to Besnik, who speaks for about 30 seconds and hangs up.
``Come over at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning,'' he says.
 &HT;    The KLA camp, in the mountains a few miles north of Bajram
Curri, is something of an anticlimax. It sits forlornly in an
abandoned army barracks. Inside, hundreds of bedraggled recruits
are bedded down on the hard floor; more sleep on the grass outside.
They have no cooking or bathing facilities. Trucks and minivans
drive in and out, adding more guns, grenades and ammunition to the
already sizable cache inside the base.
 &HT;    I had heard rumors that Iranians, Chechens and Albanians who had
fought in the Bosnian army were training the raw KLA recruits, but
the squalor and disorder of the camp suggest there is no training
at all. Rather, the camp is a staging post for Kosovars to rest and
get a weapon and a patch with the Albanian two-headed eagle before
heading back across the border.
 &HT;    Throughout the spring, young men and boys _ some no more than 13
_ set out from the camp in groups of 100 or so with convoys of
mules and horses loaded with weapons. In less than three months,
following the Serbs' winter offensive, the KLA mushroomed from a
collection of rural militants into an insurgency.
 &HT;    But by the beginning of July, the young men in the camp say they
are having trouble crossing into Kosovo. Serbian forces have moved
in along the border to stop the arms-smuggling, and it seems to be
working.
 &HT;    Two weeks after my visit, at the end of July, Milosevic's forces
embark on an offensive ostensibly aimed at eliminating the KLA. In
fact, Serbian troops roll through village after village with tanks
and heavy artillery. The KLA and the civilians flee in advance of
the army, which means there is very little actual fighting. Serbian
police follow the army to loot valuables and set homes on fire. The
KLA is in retreat.
 &HT;    I go to Vranoc, Florin's family's hometown, in mid-August while
the Serb offensive is still under way. They haven't leveled Vranoc
yet, but they've reached the neighboring village. It is only a
matter of time.
 &HT;    It's another month before I speak to Florin again, and the news
is bad, though hardly unexpected. ``Vranoc was leveled,'' he says.
There is a wire story in The New York Times reporting that 40,000
refugees are on the run in western Kosovo. Florin's family is
missing. They are probably among the refugees.
 &HT;    On Oct. 2, Florin leaves Brooklyn for Albania to deliver another
supply of cash for the KLA. He has got word that his family is safe
in Pec, the city nearest Vranoc.
 &HT;    The KLA, for the most part, appears to have been thoroughly
routed by the Serbs. There are about 300,000 new refugees, some 400
villages have been destroyed, hundreds have been killed and the
Western powers are threatening airstrikes if Serbian police and
military forces do not pull out of Kosovo.
 &HT;    ``As long as NATO airstrikes are a possibility, we will keep
confrontations at a low level,'' Florin says. ``If they start
bombing, the KLA will be back within 10 hours. But I don't think
that will happen. Milosevic will pull back at the last minute.''
 &HT;    I ask him about Adrian. ``If Adrian were alive, he would be
commanding the KLA He had lots of energy and he was a bad loser.
His only problem was that he had no patience. I knew he would get
killed. He didn't know when to stop.''
 &HT;    I ask him about a few other KLA soldiers. He says he knows
nothing about them. ''I don't like to know personal things. I
always know which ones are going to die. That's why I don't get too
close.''
 &HT;    It's mid-October when we meet again at his house on Chester
Street in Brooklyn. Just a couple of days earlier, the U.S. envoy,
Richard C. Holbrooke, had brokered a peace providing for a Serb
withdrawal and the placing of international monitors. A month
hence, it would become clear that the KLA had risen again, newly
energized. But even now, it is clear that it won't be vanquished.
 &HT;    ``We want to wait for Milosevic to pull back as much as possible
and for as many monitors as possible to come into Kosovo. With the
monitors on the ground, the Serbs won't be able to attack our
civilians.
 &HT;    ``Then,'' he says quietly, ``we can fight man to man.''

GOP UNDERMINES THE PRESIDENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HARRY ROSENFELD  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The victory of the right wing of the Republican
Party is complete and assured.
</P>
<P>
   After months of endless probes and public hearings, they have
made certain that all future presidents of the United States are
exposed to a vulnerability which their zealotry to get Bill Clinton
has invented.
</P>
<P>
   There is no going back. It doesn't matter if the House finally
votes censure rather than impeachment. It doesn't matter if the
House votes impeachment and the Senate votes not to convict. The
precedent has been established, through the relentlessness of
deep-seated partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   The consequence is to redefine the separation of powers among
the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government,
weakening the presidency. Future presidents will govern in a world
in which they know that at any moment their political opposition
could endanger their term of office through a menu of techniques
enshrined by the success of radical Republicans sitting on the
House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Most tiresome to bear were the ideologues as they portrayed
themselves as heavy-hearted, bearing an unbearable burden, for
having been compelled to vote articles of impeachment. Contrary to
their claim that they were seeking only the higher public good, the
way they conducted the hearings was plainly unfair as they adopted
the prosecution's case without testing it. The staunch
conservatives made it transparently clear that they had stumbled
across a golden opportunity to do undo what two national elections
had imposed on them.
</P>
<P>
   Now whether and how Clinton survives politically is merely
temporal. What will abide is that future political factions,
seeking to enervate the executive, will have a handle on the
tactics courtesy of the Republicans. What is frightening is the
skimpiness of the issues, pellucidly partisan in sum and substance,
that the Republican exploited to achieve their success.
</P>
<P>
   They also established a new, low standard as to what merits
impeachment of a president. Thereby, they set the bar extremely low
for emulation. Not only that, but the success of the Republicans
today means that future presidents will undertake their
responsibilities in the light of the new susceptibility. This poses
the danger that they will reshape policies opposed by the factions
lest they trigger the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   That would distort the balance of powers between Congress and
the president. In this context, what is alarming is the quality of
the accusations against Clinton. They trivialize the purpose for
which the Framers included impeachment in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars, including those of Republican persuasion, have
testified that impeachment was meant to deal with a president whose
conduct impaired the affairs of state. Impeachment, by their
testimony, was not designed to deal with private-life affairs,
which may also violate law.
</P>
<P>
   Sexual misbehavior and its cover-up do not rise to
impeachability. As the president is not above the law, he or she
must answer for any legal transgressions, in a court of law after
the incumbency is completed. This provides for equity under law
without undermining the institution of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The charges upon which articles of impeachment have been voted,
in a party-line vote, show how exposed future presidents will be.
President Clinton came under investigation by the office of
independent counsel for his dealings in the Whitewater real estate
ventures in Arkansas while he was governor. Of this charge, he was
cleared.
</P>
<P>
   He was accused of misusing the FBI in shaking up the White House
travel office when he took office, a serious charge. He was
cleared. Then the independent counsel cleared him of wrongdoing of
the most serious accusation, that he made illegal use of FBI files
on Republicans that some White House staffers had in their
possession.
</P>
<P>
   The serious accusations having fallen by the wayside, Clinton is
impeached for perjuries and obstructions in attempting to hide his
consensual relationship with a White House intern. The Lewinsky
affair only was dragged in at the last moment by the independent
counsel, when the more weighty accusations against Clinton were
fading.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton-Lewinsky affair mattered only because of the Paula
Corbin Jones civil suit against Clinton, for allegedly
propositioning her while she was a state employee and he was
governor. Jones' lawyers wanted Lewinsky's testimony to support
their case. But a judge ruled the Lewinsky matter was not material
and rejected the Jones claim as not valid because she did not
suffer any penalty for having rejected Clinton's overture.
</P>
<P>
   The Jones case had been launched at a right-wing political
function, and conservatives underwrote her legal effort (finally
concluded by Clinton paying an $850,000 settlement). The lies
Clinton is accused of telling in the impeachment articles are
related to his testimony in the Jones case, and his subsequent
appearance before the independent counsel's grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   If such a jerry-built construction is permitted to undermine a
presidency, for a malfeasance that ordinary people are only
sometimes punished for, then, of course, adventurers in years to
come need only employ their imaginations to attack other chief
executives again and again.

THE YANKEE CLIPPER REMAINS AN INDEFATIGABLE FORCE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Anyone who was surprised at Joe DiMaggio _
angrily ripping himself off of death's door last weekend _ doesn't
know much about The Yankee Clipper.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the 84-year-old DiMaggio's celebrated achievements, his
most dazzling is probably the least acknowledged. What may be more
awesome and amazing than any of his professional baseball feats or
his long, loyal love for Marilyn Monroe, is DiMaggio's ability to
preserve _ for more than 60 years _ his godlike stature.
</P>
<P>
   How has he managed it? By taking a page from the legendary Greta
Garbo's book and guarding his private life with a diligence and
ferocity that defy this perniciously nosey culture of ours.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder he couldn't stay in a coma and just go quietly into
the night in a Hollywood, Fla., hospital. Never mind the lung
cancer, the breathing tube, the last rites, the debate over a ``do
not resuscitate'' order. Screw all those warm-up obituaries
everybody has been printing of late.
</P>
<P>
   Regular updates to the news media? About the personal, physical
condition of Joe DiMaggio? Hell no. Heaven can wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``We allowed Joe to talk this morning (Sunday) and he was very
angry,'' one of DiMaggio's doctors said. ``He said `No more
press.'''
</P>
<P>
   Protecting his privacy, retaining some mystery and maintaining
legend status are astounding accomplishments, especially when you
think of them in the context of us, the world's most photographed,
videotaped, profiled, examined, analyzed and over-exposed
population.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: DiMaggio was born in 1914, reached the pinnacle of
professional success and retired when Harry Truman was still in the
White House. Other than endorsing an electric coffee maker and a
New York savings bank in the 1970s, he hasn't worked publicly at
anything for the past 47 years.
</P>
<P>
   He never married another sex goddess, never bought a baseball
team or movie studio, never slapped his name on a casino or
fast-food chain, never ran for political office, never became a
regular on a quiz show, never wrote a tell-all autobiography or
announced that he needed a new liver.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the mention of the man's name never fails to bring
recognition, and rarely fails to inspire a reverence and wistful
longing in people of all ages.
</P>
<P>
   And when the man happened to enter a room ...
</P>
<P>
   No matter the audience, the effect of Joe DiMaggio's mere
presence on adult men and women remains unparalleled; he reduces
most of them to speechless, starry-eyed kids. Just the word that
DiMaggio might attend a fund-raiser or tribute, or drop into a
favorite joint for a nightcap in San Francisco, was enough to raise
the energy level of any crowd. On the rare occasion he actually did
show up, as he moved across the room _ self-contained and wary _ he
was followed by excited whispers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's him!'' ``There's the Yankee Clipper.'' ``Jesus, Joe
DiMaggio.''
</P>
<P>
   Italians have a term for what DiMaggio first created when he
donned those flannel Yankee pinstripes and what he has miraculously
maintained until this very day: bella figura. It means ``beautiful
image'' and is used to describe everything from the way a person
looks in a polished pair of expensive shoes to the near-perfect
existence some folks at least appear to have lived.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio's celebrated batting swing is the epitome of bella
figura. Marrying Marilyn Monroe, then staying loyal and devoted to
her even after divorce _ in a mysterious, low-profile way _ is not
a bad example either.
</P>
<P>
   But the most beautiful DiMaggio image is the one we have now: A
very old, ill man somehow occupies the collective mind's eye of
America as a gorgeous and virile superhero. And he is a man who
will stay forever right where we most want and need him to be _
just beyond our reach.

KID POWER: BURGER TITANS AIM LOW FOR MARKET SHARE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Whoever has the best and most toys sells the fast
food.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Burger King outlets are dangling the promise of
wristwatches and toys based on characters in the recent ``Rugrats
Movie'' and cable television series, while bigger rival McDonald's
fights back with merchandise based on the movie ``A Bug's Life.''
</P>
<P>
   This shows how complex burger marketing is these days. If you
want to attract more customers, the food outlets figure, you have
to entice the key influence peddlers in families: the kids.
</P>
<P>
   So in commercials, just promise them toys based on popular
children's film and television characters, and then they'll plead
with their parents to take them out for fast food.
</P>
<P>
   This strategy works, said Ted Potrikus, who occupies the dual
role of father of two and vice president of the Retail Council of
New York State.
</P>
<P>
   ``The meal premium is a considerable factor in the decision of
what fast-food restaurant to go to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other parents are similarly influenced, it appears.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the stores are very busy. We are constantly shuffling
watches to make sure the stores have even supplies,'' said Mike
Neuhaus, district supervisor for Carrols Corp., which operates 21
Burger King franchises in the Albany area.
</P>
<P>
   Neuhaus expects especially brisk demand this week, when the
Rugrats' Talking Tommy character is featured in the collection of
four wristwatches. The little timepieces sell for $1.99 with a
so-called ``value'' meal.
</P>
<P>
   The watches, along with 12 character toys given away with Kids
Club meals, have already done quite a bit for the greater good of
Burger King, said Charles Nicolas, a company spokesman in Miami.
The promotion started Nov. 18 and in the first week national unit
sales of kids meals doubled, and Whopper Junior orders went up 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Also, orders for chicken tenders shot up 27 percent. Burger King
has been able to make the chicken snacks in the shape of Rugrats
characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The little kids get a kick out of them,'' Neuhaus said.
</P>
<P>
   Burger King may have an edge over rival McDonald's in this
particular toy competition, Neuhaus said. That's because the
Rugrats TV show has already built up a wide following, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had years of cultivating fans for the Rugrats,'' he
said. The recent movie just adds fuel to the fire.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, ``A Bug's Life,'' the competitive media offering
from McDonald's, has only its recent movie audience to pull from,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that film is influential too, said Potrikus, whose
daughters have seen ``A Bug's Life'' and then wanted the toys. ``My
6-year-old knew which restaurant to go to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The McDonald's promotion of ``A Bug's Life'' merchandise is
scheduled to last through Dec. 24, and the Burger King-Rugrats
promotion is scheduled to run through Jan. 3.

PLO MILITANT'S SON PURSUES PEACE PEACEFULLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAZA _ The Palestinian Authority's point man responsible for
coordinating President Clinton's visit, Jihad Wazir, handled the
crush of last-minute details flawlessly Monday.
</P>
<P>
   There were phone lines to worry about, satellite links, and
security protocols. It took all of Sunday night to choose which
symbol of Palestinian sovereignty to mount behind the podium at
which President Clinton and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat would
speak.
</P>
<P>
   And throughout the historic day in the Palestinian march toward
self-determination, Wazir thought of his father.
</P>
<P>
   Khalil Wazir was Arafat's closest aide and chief military
commander of the Palestine Liberation Organization from its
creation in 1964. His nomme de guerre was ``Abu Jihad'' _ he father
of Jihad, or holy struggle.
</P>
<P>
   But to the United States and Israel, he was one of the world's
master terrorists. He was assassinated in 1988 by masked Israeli
commandos who broke into his home in Tunis and sprayed him with
bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Father and son could not be more different. The father wore
fatigues and carried a machine gun. The son prefers pinstripes and
carries a mobile phone. The father believed in armed resistance,
the son in economic empowerment.
</P>
<P>
   The two generations show how the Palestinian fight for
independence has evolved from orchestrated killing to business
development. And they tell of Jihad's painful reconciliation to the
forces of history that led to his father's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hit me when I saw the American and Palestinian flags flying
together. It gave me a chill to think how far we've come,'' said
Jihad, 35, who is the director of Gaza's new World Trade Center.
``I suddenly realized it's really happening. I thought how happy my
father would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Jihad is the oldest of six children. His father's militant
activities made it dangerous and difficult for them to see each
other, but they remained close nonetheless. When his father was
killed, Jihad was a student at Marquette University, where he
eventually received his degree. He is now as committed as his
father to the creation of a Palestinian state but in a completely
different way.
</P>
<P>
   He knew his father well enough to be sure that he would have
been thrilled with the symbolism of the Clinton visit but concerned
that the Palestinians still do not have control over their own
destiny. To acquire it, he knows, will require financial
independence as well as political sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   ``This growing recognition of the Palestinian state means a lot
to us,'' he said. ``But having a real state means being able to
travel freely _ not to be told by 18-year-old Israeli soldiers to
remove my belt, my shoes, every time I want to leave Gaza. It's
about dignity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have that yet, but it will happen,'' Jihad continued.
``We've all sacrificed too much for it not to happen. I'm going to
make sure it happens for my son.''
</P>
<P>
   Jihad has named the 18-month-old after his grandfather.

PRESIDENT'S RELIANCE ON POLLS COULD BACKFIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One of President Clinton's key arguments against
impeachment is that polls show most Americans oppose it. But
relying on polls is a high-risk strategy that could backfire.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, for example, an ABC News poll found that 58 percent of
Americans think that if Clinton is impeached, he should resign
rather than fight at a Senate trial. While polls still show the
public overwhelmingly opposes impeachment, the ABC finding
indicates the public's willingness to stand behind Clinton may be
much softer than the White House realizes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton aides had hoped that as the public realized the House
Judiciary Committee approved four articles of impeachment last
week, more Americans would become outraged and oppose impeachment.
Thirty-eight percent of those surveyed in the latest ABC poll over
the weekend favored impeachment. But that was up from 33 percent a
week ago and 27 percent six weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Republican pollster Neil Newhouse marveled at the way Clinton's
defenders have urged GOP members to look at the polls and vote
against impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm incredulous that polling has come up as much as it did in
the hearings,'' Newhouse said, referring to remarks by Democrats on
the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Newhouse, like a number of analysts, said he wonders whether
most Americans understand that a House vote for impeachment does
not result in the removal of a president. It takes a two-thirds
vote of the Senate to convict and oust a president.
</P>
<P>
   At least two polls taken in October show that Newhouse is right
to wonder. According to a Fox News poll, only 40 percent of those
surveyed knew that a House vote for impeachment did not result in
the removal of the president. The poll found that 42 percent
thought a president was removed after a House impeachment vote and
18 percent were not sure.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the intense media coverage presumably has helped
inform the public that House impeachment leads to a Senate trial,
and some polls now spell out the process before asking questions
about it. Indeed, that might be one reason support for impeachment
rose last week. With widespread speculation that the Senate would
fall short of the two-thirds vote and acquit the president, many
people may see impeachment as a form of rebuke the president
deserves, especially since the House appears unlikely to allow a
vote to censure Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't appear that the actual passing of the articles of
impeachment has affected people's views on Clinton,'' said David
Moore of the Gallup organization, which polls for CNN and USA
Today. ``You might think that might have a negative effect on
Clinton, but in fact that doesn't appear to be the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Karlyn Bowman, an expert on public opinion at the American
Enterprise Institute, said the polls show a ``deeply conflicted''
public. With the majority of those surveyed approving of Clinton's
job performance, she said, many people are just now focusing on the
impeachment debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been pulling away from the debate for so long that
it is hard to know how hard the numbers are,'' Bowman said. A close
reading of the polls shows that while a majority of those surveyed
still oppose impeachment, a minority said they would be ``angry''
if Clinton were impeached. In other words, the lack of public
passion that appeared to have helped Clinton for much of the year
now could hurt him as the House heads toward an impeachment vote on
Thursday or Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Christopher Shays, a Connecticut Republican, said
he is surprised the public hasn't risen up against impeachment. ``I
am not hearing this great outcry,'' Shays said Monday. ``What was
helping the president before was the blase attitude. Now you have
the same attitude again, so there is no strong counterforce to
impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, speaking to reporters on Sunday in Israel, cited polls
in urging the House to allow a vote on a censure resolution.
``Apparently some three-quarters of the American people think it's
the right thing to do,'' Clinton said. But if the public sees
impeachment as a ``super censure,'' as it has been characterized by
some, then support for censure might translate into more support
for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The polls may indicate hidden problems for Clinton. For example,
a CNN survey found that 67 percent of those surveyed believe
Clinton committed perjury, and 56 percent think he should admit it.
Clinton has adamantly denied he committed perjury.
</P>
<P>
   One White House official said recently that internal polls may
have lulled Clinton aides into a false security. White House
officials said they were not prepared for the way Republicans
ignored the surveys and marched ahead with impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   During the Watergate crisis, President Nixon often took heart in
polls that showed a majority of those surveyed did not favor
impeachment. But, according to the Gallup Poll's David Moore, that
changed after the release of the famous ``smoking gun'' tape, in
which Nixon approved a plan for the CIA to block an FBI Watergate
investigation. For Clinton, if any new incriminating material
surfaces, perhaps during a Senate trial, his support could crumble.
</P>
<P>
   The most striking finding in the current batch of polls may be
the way the public thinks members of Congress should do their job.
While Republican leaders have said members should base their
impeachment vote on their conscience, a CNN poll found that the
public wants such votes to be based on the views of constituents.
The poll found that 70 percent of those surveyed think the
impeachment vote should be influenced by the people they represent,
while only 27 percent said the vote should be based on a member's
conscience.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the poll said that members of Congress should
pay more attention to the polls.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When presidential candidates fail, they usually curse the fates
or cry foul.
</P>
<P>
   Morris K. ``Mo'' Udall, the lanky Arizona congressman, did
neither when he lost the 1976 Democratic nomination to Jimmy Carter
after a series of narrow, second-place finishes in the primaries..
Like the old professional basketball player he was, Udall
attributed his defeat to the breaks of the game. ``The people have
spoken,'' he said, and added with a smile, ``damn 'em.'' Then he
went on to work diligently for Carter's election.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did he complain when first diagnosed with Parkinson's
disease, the malady that crippled him for most of this decade and
finally killed him in his 77th year Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   When he became aware of the symptoms 20 years ago, several
members of Congress were reeling from accusations that they had
been romantically involved with a lobbyist named Paula Parkinson.
``There are two kinds of Parkinson's diseases,'' Udall said. ``They
both cause you to lose sleep, and both leave you shaking all
over.''
</P>
<P>
   He mocked his illness. He actually suffered, he claimed, from
``the dread disease, presidentialitis.'' It could only be cured, he
said, with embalming fluid.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the 1980s, when he pondered another presidential
campaign, Udall handled his decision-making in the best tradition
of another wry Westerner, Will Rogers. ``I'm waiting for a sign,''
Udall said. ``Perhaps a comet or a new star rising in the east.
Perhaps three Democratic senators, riding to my house on camels
bearing gifts of mirth, frankincense and Extra-Strength Tylenol.''
</P>
<P>
   No sign appeared, and he abandoned his last dreams of the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   But as chairman of the House Interior Committee, he counted as
his accomplishments the passage of the Alaska Lands Act, which
protected millions of acres of wilderness from development, his
moves to support the rights of American-Indians, and a landmark
bill to curb strip mining.
</P>
<P>
   For all of his legislative skills and his presidential race in
1976 that rallied liberals around the country, Udall is best
remembered for his sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   During his New Hampshire primary campaign, he told of stopping
in a barbershop to introduce himself: ``I'm Mo Udall, running for
president.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the barber replied: ``We know, we were just laughing
about that this morning.''
</P>
<P>
   He also told crowds of a billboard he claimed to have seen in
front of a church in New England. The sign's message said: ``If
tired of sin, come in.'' Underneath, Udall said, someone had
scrawled, ``If not, call 765-4321.''
</P>
<P>
   Udall loved to tell of the mythical politician who visited an
Indian reservation to promise forthcoming goodies from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The residents seemed enthusiastic. They chanted: ``Goom-wah!
Goom-wah!'' So the politician made additional promises, and his
audience again chanted, ``Goom-wah. Goom-wah!''
</P>
<P>
   On his way out, the politician was led to a corral to receive a
ceremonial pony, and Udall said the chief warned the visitor,
``Watch out and don't step in the goom-wah.''
</P>
<P>
   Though a liberal Democrat, Udall enjoyed bipartisan friendships.
John Anderson, a Republican congressman who mounted a third-party
campaign for the presidency in 1980, was a close associate.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John McCain, a Republican member of the Arizona
delegation, remembers Udall as a wise and helpful mentor on Indian
affairs. In recent years, as Udall lay helpless, McCain quietly
visited him regularly in the hospital to hold his hand and talk to
him. ``I don't know if he knew I was there, but it was something I
felt I should do,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Udall's longtime aide, Bob Neuman, reflected Monday on the
former congressman's death. ``Mo was intelligent, a visionary; he
had a great feeling for what he was doing and he had a real sense
of self. He was capable of civility and compromise you don't see
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Neuman said he heard Udall died with a smile on his face. ``I
have a hunch he was watching the Judiciary Committe on C-Span and
died laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   Udall might also have been smiling at the prospect that the name
lives on. His son, Mark, will be sworn in next month as a
congressman from Colorado.

I WISH I MAY, I WISH I MIGHT . . . 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Andy Gaus of Boston can't understand how two little words _ may
and might _ can cause so much trouble for writers. He points to a
recent Globe story that said President Kennedy ``may have welcomed
a more candid overview of his administration'' than the Kennedy
Library offers. Wrong, says Gaus. ``Things that definitely didn't
happen and are only being imagined as unreal scenarios'' _ in this
case, Kennedy's giving an opinion on the exhibit _ ``are things
that `might have happened.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Another reader, back in October, had also weighed in on might,
sending me a column with ``you may have learned'' corrected to
might _ without further comment. I wasn't convinced that may was
wrong, but I hadn't yet investigated; Gaus's complaint, and his
testimony to the spread of the misplaced may, prompted me to hit
the books in search of the answers.
</P>
<P>
   And for once, it was no pleasant task. Some usage guides
commented on one aspect of may vs. might, some on another; a few
ignored it entirely. But sorting through the evidence, it seems
that only one of the may/might constructions is truly troublesome.
</P>
<P>
   Among the usage mavens, the most widespread dictum is that might
indicates slightly less likelihood than may: ``We may go to Greece
next summer'' means you've bought the travel guide, ``we might go''
means you're considering Scotland, too. But it's a mystery how a
rule so subjective has stayed on the books: The speaker, surely,
has one idea of the likelihood of the event, the listener another.
And the sliver of difference between the two verbs is probably
overshadowed, in real life, by other clues: tones of voice, facial
expressions, whether the discussion progresses to golf or Greek
islands, ouzo or Lagavulin.
</P>
<P>
   I suspected that any consensus on this distinction had long
since evaporated, and a quick survey of fellow editors deepened
that suspicion. ``I grew up in the South, and use might every
time,'' said one. Another felt that might called for further
explanation: ``I might go to Sally's party _ if I know for certain
my first wife isn't going to be there.'' A third reversed the
traditional distinction, using may for a more speculative plan,
might for a concrete, close-to-home possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the experts tell you that might is the past tense of may,
as indeed it once was. But may and might are now used only as
auxiliaries _ in combination with other verbs _ and they appear in
contexts describing both past and future. You may have learned and
you might have learned are equally correct in a speculative
context, if the speaker doesn't know whether you did or didn't.
</P>
<P>
   The past/present distinction does show up in one kind of
sentence: If the main clause is in the past, might will follow
along like a good, obedient past tense: ``Jerry feared that he
might chicken out,'' not may. But that's not where most people go
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the only may/might problem causing any significant
trouble is the one Andy Gaus points out. If you write ``The
operation may have saved her,'' you're implying that the patient is
still alive, whether the surgeon's skill or some other treatment
did the trick. If you know the patient died, only might, suggesting
the facts are otherwise, is appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   So my colleague who sticks to might every time may be on to
something. If you'd like to be equally safe in past-tense
situations, just remember: If you're talking about something that's
entirely hypothetical, quite unlikely, or definitely not the case,
only might makes it right.

Must be the season of the merch
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's been insider jargon for more than a decade, but this season
the merch is going mainstream: Newsweek, which likes to package
trendy language for mass consumption, used the slang _ short for
merchandise, of course _ in two different stories in one November
issue. (Geoffrey Beene on Vogue: ``Even the ads used to be quite
beautiful. Now it's merch, merch, merch.'') Editrix, in the same
issue, is clearly a limited-edition word (Anna Wintour and Tina
Brown may have earned it, but not many others); and telcos, for
telephone companies, may or may not catch on. But I'd put a small
wager on merch to make it in America; it captures nicely our range
of feelings, from fond to neutral to contemptuous, about the heaps
of stuff we buy and sell one another.

 TAKES-BOS  
 (Includes tips and books tables.) (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Four years ago, Karen Baker's husband informed her that his
company was transferring him to Japan and he'd rather not take her
along. But the prospect of divorce was just the beginning of her
troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Baker did not know how to balance a checkbook. (That had been
one of her husband's jobs during their 24 years of marriage.) She
didn't know how to pay the bills. And she didn't have any credit,
since it had all been in her husband's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were so many things I had no idea about,'' says Baker,
who was living in Pennsylvania at the time. ``I didn't even know I
was entitled to his Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, four years and one women's ``divorce recovery'' seminar
later, Baker is a woman transformed. The divorce course _ taught by
a lawyer, a financial adviser and an accountant _ guided her
through the court process, helped her get a handle on her assets,
and convinced her that she deserved a healthy chunk of the
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   So confident is the newly empowered Baker that she recently
turned the tables on her ex-husband. When she discovered that he
owed her a ``hefty'' share of tax money that she'd paid earlier on
his behalf, she hired a lawyer to go after him. She got her money;
it was ``my last hurrah,'' the Marshfield, Mass. woman says
proudly.
</P>
<P>
   Meet today's new divorced woman. She is tough, aggressive, and
armed to the teeth with ammunition on how to get what she wants in
divorce court. It all comes courtesy of a profusion of new books,
videos, and workshops geared to teaching women how to go for the
jugular when their marriage breaks up.
</P>
<P>
   The language of this material is not just militant but
militaristic. It urges women to use ``psychological warfare'' to
trump their husbands. It recommends espionage, furtive behavior,
even, in one book, ``enemy reconnaissance.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet many lawyers interviewed say such tactics are not
unreasonable. Over the last decade or so, they say, the divorce
landscape has changed in ways that have made the legal process more
unkind and less gentle than it's ever been for women, particularly
mothers seeking custody of their children. They describe a variety
of factors, ranging from a feminist movement backlash to a strong
lobby by father's rights groups, that make it necessary for today's
divorcing woman to fight harder than ever to win in court.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the new book, ``What Every Woman Should Know About
Divorce and Custody'' by author Sally Abrahms and Philadelphia
lawyer Gayle Rosenwald Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to assume you no longer have the edge in custody,''
the authors caution. ``Up until now, women have assumed that they
will prevail in court. But ``this overconfidence and resulting lack
of preparation is tripping them up.''
</P>
<P>
   The reality, they point out, is that today's mothers usually
take the bigger economic hit in a divorce _ an average 30 percent
decline in their standard of living. Yet mothers may lose custody
because they have to work to support the kids. `You will need to
view custody as a mind game and position yourself to win,'' they
warn grimly in an opening chapter so disillusioning it's enough to
make any mother think twice about leaving.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
-------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other writers contributing to this new genre are even more
aggressive, such as lawyers Sharyn Sooho and Steven Fuchs, author
of ``Tao of Divorce: A Woman's Guide to Winning,'' which they
published on the Internet. The book integrates Eastern philosophy
with divorce, and urges women to adopt such strategies as ``enemy
reconnaissance, strategic information, covert planning, and the
element of surprise'' to get what they want in court. (They do not
rule out, for example, ransacking the house for secret places where
the husband might have hidden assets or using his secretary's diary
to retrace his whereabouts when investigating adultery.)
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the even more combative ``Divorce War! 50
Strategies Every Woman Needs to Know to Win'' by Kansas lawyer
Bradley A. Pistotnik. Among the tactics he recommends are ``control
your husband by being alternately loving and indifferent to keep
him in a state of continual concern'' and ``hire a detective to
prove your husband has a bad character, and pay for the services
with your husband's money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how nice your husband has been, once he has caused
you to seek a divorce, it is time to fight,'' Pistotnik maintains.
``Loss of love is a catastrophe. Revenge is all that is left to
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Advice comes in other forms as well. Lawyer Isabella Jancourtz,
author of ``The Massachusetts Women's Divorce Handbook,'' teaches a
course with a psychiatric social worker at the Cambridge (Mass.)
Center for Adult Education designed to help women through the
divorce ordeal ``by taking their fate into their own hands and by
becoming emotionally empowered,'' says Jancourtz.
</P>
<P>
   A Pennsylvania lawyer has produced a four-hour video _
``Navigating Divorce: Women in Control'' _ teaching women how to
get equal control of the family assets. A California woman is in
the process of launching ``Divorced Woman Magazine,'' which will
debut in March. Among the subjects covered will be ``shared stories
from others who have been there, including financial custody
issues,'' says executive editor Tina Stassis Gustave . ``There are
millions of women who need help.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Why now? And why women?
</P>
<P>
   Divorce has never been easy, and it's no picnic for the men
involved, either. Just ask any of the dads in the father's rights
movement, like Philip Clendenning, director of the Boston group
Fathers and Families. He argues that if anyone is penalized in the
divorce process in this state, it is the fathers, who are routinely
victimized by ``grossly unfair'' laws governing child custody.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, not everyone thinks women have a worse time of it
than men. ``There is always clearly a person in divorce who thinks
they gave too much and a person who thinks they didn't get
enough,'' says Gayle Stone-Turesky of the family law firm Stone,
Stone and Creem. And so often when one spouse moves on to another
partner, I think it's the person who has been left behind who has
the harder time. I don't think it's a male-female issue.''
</P>
<P>
   But most lawyers interviewed agree that child custody cases _
which formerly favored the mother _ are getting more unpredictable
and difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started law 18 years ago, the viewpoint was that men
made out better with money and women with the kids,'' says Boston
lawyer David Cherny, president-elect of the Massachusetts chapter
of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Two working parents are now ``more the norm than the
aberration,'' says Cherny, and judges are much more willing be to
regard fathers as equal and adequate caretakers _ especially since
baby sitters are doing so much of the caretaking anyway. ``Things
aren't as automatic as they were.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been a lot of changes in the financial arena, too,
Cherny says. ``Years ago, one spouse was the wage earner and one
wasn't, and the rule of thumb was that about one-third of the
income was paid as alimony.'' But now wives often have their own
income or the educational ability to earn one. ``You find the
courts looking at earning potential and saying there isn't as much
need for alimony,'' Cherny says. So women _ despite their hard-won
gains in the workplace _ ``are almost being penalized. . . . What's
developed is almost a backlash. It's made for a lot more aggressive
litigation over money.''
</P>
<P>
   Throw a few other contemporary factors into the mix, and it's no
wonder women are reading books about how to be conniving and savvy.
</P>
<P>
   Simply determining the joint assets in a dissolving marriage can
be messy and miserable, let alone dividing them up in an equitable
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that you'd have a pay stub and that was it,''
says Cherny. ``You'd have a house, a car, a bank account. Now,
remuneration is more complex. Our lives are more sophisticated.
There are retirement benefits, stock benefits, non-cash
compensation elements, deferred compensation.''
</P>
<P>
   So for women who, like Baker, leave the money issues to the men,
there is a lot of catching up to do to avoid being taken advantage
of. And lawyers say such women are not in short supply.

<P>
   Caught up in the impeachment maelstrom are two of the most
admirable men in the House of Representatives. Benjamin Gilman of
New York, first elected in 1972, is chairman of International
Affairs Committee. James A. Leach of Iowa, first elected in 1976,
is chairman of the Banking Committee. Both are currently listed as
being undecided.
</P>
<P>
   They are men of stature, reminders of when Republicans were the
party of business. They symbolize the broad bipartisan approach
that put Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, and Ronald Reagan in the
White House. Now they are an endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of months ago, my colleague John Ellis wrote that the
Republican Party had been divided into three parts. One was the
dominant wing of cultural conservatives, representing 55 percent to
60 percent of the party: ``religious, patriotic, and hyperactive in
state and local politics,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   A second faction is made up of economic libertarians,
exemplified by publisher Steve Forbes and the editorial page of The
Wall Street Journal. Ellis put them at 7 percent to 10 percent of
the party: ``Small in number, their voice is broadcast across
hundreds of megaphones.''
</P>
<P>
   These distinctions are real; Ellis understands them better than
most. But alliances among factions make them confusing. Together, I
think of these two as making up the ``Taliban Wing'' of the GOP,
after the Islamic fundamentalist movement that staged a successful
insurrection in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   A third group of ``traditional Republicans,'' comprising about
33 percent of the party, is internationalist, pro-business, and
more moderate on social issues. ``Above all, they believe in
America's mission and preeminence in the global community,'' Ellis
wrote. I'm not sure about his numbers _ he knows the GOP better
than I do _ but I know that Leach and Gilman belong to this third
camp. How they vote will have much to say about whether Clinton is
impeached.
</P>
<P>
   To understand the campaign for the president's ouster, it is
necessary to go back to 1990. That was when the Taliban Wing first
split from George Bush, criticizing his decision to seek to trim
the federal deficit on the eve of the Gulf War, asserting that they
were the true inheritors of the ``Reagan Revolution.'' Their
defection cost the Republicans victory in 1992, and did even
greater damage in 1996, when they turned on Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   It is this Taliban Wing that is now trying to undo the results
of these two presidential elections _ to gain through special
prosecutors what they had lost at polls. Even more remarkable, they
are trying to do it as a lame-duck Congress, flouting the results
of the last election.
</P>
<P>
   I think of myself as a conservative Democrat. I never admired
Clinton; until very near the last of the campaign, I preferred
another term for Bush. I gave up only after it became clear he had
lost control of the Taliban faction within his own administration.
Now, however, I believe that the improbable hero of the 1990s will
turn out to have been Bill Clinton, once we get a little distance
from events.
</P>
<P>
   Two events loom large. The first was the decision in January,
about a week after news of the Lewinsky matter first broke, to
forgo candor. The second was Aug. 17, when an angry Clinton stalked
out of his grand jury testimony and addressed the nation that
evening, admitting an affair with the young intern and attacking
independent counsel Kenneth Starr. Both decisions are widely taken
to have been mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   People keep saying he brought it on himself, but that's not so.
All he did was to insist that his sex life was none of Starr's
business. It was the Taliban that brought the inquisition _ they
and their allies in the press.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal has long been rabid on the subject of
impeachment; indeed, it can be fairly said that it started it all.
Howell Raines, editorial page editor at The New York Times, has
been characterized aptly as a vicious bulldog snapping at Clinton's
pants. Sally Quinn wrote in The Washington Post about that nice
Kenneth Starr and the shame that Clinton has brought upon
Georgetown society. Even as wise a head as David Broder of the Post
last week called upon Clinton to resign. History will not deal
kindly with these positions.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any other spokesman for responsibility? Business
leaders, not surprisingly, are silent. Bush has lost his voice.
Dole is making commercials for Viagra. Candidates for the
Republican nomination in 2000 are avoiding the issue. So decent men
like Ben Gilman and Jim Leach are all that are left. How they vote
will determine whether their ``traditional Republican'' species
will survive.

FATALITY CASE IN CALIFORNIA MELDS RELIGION, LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   POMONA, Calif. _ The odds caught up with Keith Cook the night he
got drunk and slammed his truck into two cars, sending them
smashing into four people who stood nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The chance that one of his victims would be a Jehovah's Witness
and that she would die was 52 million to one, according to a
statistician. But Jadine Russell did die, after refusing blood
transfusions because of her religious beliefs. Time after time, she
shouted ``No blood!'' to paramedics and doctors working to repair
her ruptured spleen, cracked ribs and other injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a case that intersects religion and law, both Cook and
Russell's behavior are on trial. The prosecution accuses him of
murder. Defense attorneys accuse her of essentially killing
herself. The jury will have to decide whether the death of a woman
whose religion compelled her to refuse basic medical treatment can
be blamed on the man responsible for her injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is responsible for the injury; he is not responsible for
the death. . .'' said defense attorney Charles Unger, who wants the
charges reduced to driving under the influence and causing an
accident with injuries. ``It's really inappropriate that he could
end up spending his life in prison.''
</P>
<P>
   The case, pitting cause against effect, is unusual but not
unprecedented, legal observers said. For instance, robbers whose
targets died of heart attacks during commission of the crime have
been convicted of various forms of murder. And in a case with
circumstances similar to Cook's, a drunk driver who hit a Jehovah's
Witness who also declined blood was convicted of vehicular
manslaughter, according to Laurie Levenson, associate dean at
Loyola Law School. A Louisiana appeals court upheld that decision
in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general rule is that you take the victim as you find
them,'' Levenson said. ``If you have the bad luck of hitting a
victim who happens to be very fragile, then you'll be responsible
for more harm.''
</P>
<P>
   No one in Los Angeles Superior Court in Pomona denies that Cook,
a 32-year-old auto mechanic who was on probation for drunk driving,
was drunk again the night of the accident. His alcohol level was
more than twice the legal limit. Instead, during the week-long
trial, medical experts have debated why exactly Russell died. The
case is expected to go to the jury Monday after closing arguments.
</P>
<P>
   One doctor testifying for the prosecution called it
``ridiculous'' to claim that she died only because she rejected a
blood transfusion. ``What killed her was the injury and the
consequences of the injury,'' said Dr. Jordan Goodstein. Yet the
trauma surgery specialist also said he would have tried to persuade
Russell to accept blood, and gave her a 70 percent to 80 percent
chance of surviving her injuries if she had.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Keany, an emergency room doctor testifying for the
defense, said Russell's hospital charts indicated that she had no
other life threatening injuries beside a ruptured spleen that
leaked blood into her abdomen. Asked if patients die from ruptured
spleens, he replied, ``Yes, they die from blood loss.'' He added
that he believed the 55-year-old mother of four could likely have
been saved.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to put my mom on trial,'' said Janet Hefti, one
of Russell's daughters. ``Blood would not have saved her life. And
she was in that position because of Mr. Cook's choices and
decisions. This did not start at USC Medical Center. It started on
Sierra Madre Road.''
</P>
<P>
   The night she died, Russell and another daughter were returning
home from a movie when she was involved in a minor traffic accident
in Azusa, about 25 miles west of Los Angeles. Both cars were pulled
roadside when Cook came barreling down a hill. He crashed into the
cars, knocking them into Russell, her daughter and two law
enforcement officials who had stopped at the accident scene. No one
else was seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   Russell was transported by helicopter to County-USC Medical
Center, where she could not be persuaded to accept blood. The
daughter involved in the accident testified that enroute Russell
had even tried to pull out an intravenous line. By the time she
reached the hospital, deputy district attorney Larry Larson said,
Russell had lost half her blood. She died six hours later.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision made wasn't made that night,'' said her husband,
James Russell. ``It was made for Jadine 45 years ago when she
dedicated her life as one of Jehovah's witnesses. . .It's
scriptural law we're obeying.''
</P>
<P>
   James Pellechia, a spokesman at church headquarters in New York,
said Chapter 5 of the Book of Acts directs the faithful to
``abstain from blood,'' an admonition the church interprets to
proscribe transfusions. Several years ago, Russell had a
hysterectomy without a transfusion, her husband said, and also
carried a medical directive card in her wallet near her insurance
card so doctors would be sure to find it.
</P>
<P>
   Jehovah's Witnesses do, however, allow a treatment called auto
transfusion, Pellechia said. In that procedure, a ``cell saver'' is
used to remove and filter blood before returning it to the patient.
Russell said his wife would have considered the treatment, had
doctors offered it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cook's lawyers, insist he is not responsible for her
death because he could not have ``reasonably foreseen'' her refusal
of blood.
</P>
<P>
   Only one million or so people in the United States are
practicing Jehovah's Witnesses, making the fatality a statistical
aberration, he said. Unger had hoped the jury would hear from a
psychologist and statistician who put the probability of driving
drunk and killing a Jehovah's Witness pedestrian at one in 52
milion. But Judge Reginald Yates refused to allow his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jehovah's Witnesses are not on the endangered species list. .
.,'' Yates said when jurors were out of his courtroom. ``If Mr.
Cook could not fairly be expected to collide with a Jehovah's
Witness who could he fairly be expected to collide with?''
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of second-degree murder, Cook faces a maximum
sentence of 15 years behind bars, compared to four to eight years
for the lesser charges that his lawyer is seeking. Unable to make
his $1 million bail, he has been in jail since the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Cooks and Russells have been in court every day, often
exchanging pleasanties. Cook's sister, Dodie O'Keefe described her
brother as ``very sorry for what happened. He knows he has a
responsibility for his actions.'' Pending the outcome of the trial,
she declined to be more specific about that responsibility. The
Russell family has no such qualms.
</P>
<P>
   ``For him to be driving drunk and say what happened is my wife's
fault is ridiculous to the extreme,'' said James Russell. ``I am
totally offended by it. She died for one reason -- because of
him.''

THE REPUBLICANS' OVER-THE-CLIFF GANG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON _ The House Republican leadership _ at last out of
the closet and pushing hard to kick President Clinton out of office
_ is asking its undecided brethren to take a third walk off a cliff
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, right about now, they said: Vote with us on our
revolutionary budget, and push the president to the wall; we will
prevail, and you won't suffer.
</P>
<P>
   They were flat wrong. The government shut down, Clinton
prevailed, and the Republicans lost half their majority.
</P>
<P>
   This year, they said: Support us on our national campaign to
make the president's conduct our major issue down the stretch, and
we can increase our majority and make impeachment a slam dunk.
</P>
<P>
   They were flat wrong again. The campaign blew up in their faces,
and the Republicans lost another half of their shrunken majority.
</P>
<P>
   Off that sterling track record of taking care of their own, the
Republican leadership is now selling impeachment as proper, moral,
politically cost-free, simple, and quick. The undecided Republicans
who fall for the sales pitch again will give new meaning to the
concept of credulity.
</P>
<P>
   There are two main risks ahead for the roughly two-dozen
congressmen who remain truly undecided and incommunicado, roughly
triple the current margin Majority Whip Tom DeLay enjoys among
members with public positions:
</P>
<P>
   --The first is that DeLay's operation is blowing smoke at the
undecided by cooing that a yes vote will be simple and more of a
process vote than a vote to kick the president out of office. In
fact, it will require several additional voting acts, each of which
will tie the hoodwinked member even tighter into precisely the role
of presidential prosecutor that the undecided seek to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   --The second is that DeLay and Judiciary Committee chairman
Henry Hyde are also blowing smoke in trying to assure the undecided
that nothing in the evidentiary case will come out or come back to
bite them. In fact, the holes in this Swiss cheese case get poked
daily.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence that should scare the bejeezus out of the undecided
should come first, and two examples will suffice:
</P>
<P>
   1. In the perjury case based on Clinton's grand jury testimony
last August, the Senate trial an undecided House member will be
responsible for would have to focus on the ``nature and details''
of the infamous relationship. That means smut, and that means above
all Monica Lewinsky's contention that the president was as
amorously attentive as she was, and his that he was not.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to have even a shot at perjury on this grand issue
is through contemporary Lewinsky statements to others, some of whom
Ken Starr found. The problem _ apart from the obvious, human
interest she would have in not telling friends that it was all her
and no him _ is that Lewinsky also told her friends lies.
</P>
<P>
   The whoppers she told Linda Tripp about her first lawyer and
Vernon Jordan are bad enough. Imagine a Senate trial where one
friend recounts Lewinsky's assertion that the Secret Service
brought Clinton to her apartment; where two others say she told
them the president and she went at it in the Oval Office naked as
jaybirds; where a steward says she told of being invited to
Martha's Vineyard; where job contacts in New York said she told of
lunching with the first lady, who had offered to help her find an
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   2. Or, as Representative William Delahund discovered late last
week, imagine the Senate trial on the return-of-gifts issue. With
no direct evidence, the Starr-Hyde inference is that Clinton told
secretary Betty Currie to call Lewinsky, who handed them over on
Dec. 28 after getting the call from Currie's cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
   Just one problem, leaving aside the fact that Currie and Clinton
contradict her. Delahunt found an FBI report of a chat with
Lewinsky in which she puts the time of the gifts transfer at two
hours minimum before the phone call from Currie allegedly to
arrange it. Neither Starr nor Hyde ever lifted a pinkie to clear up
this flagrant contradiction.
</P>
<P>
   But the GOP leadership persists in telling their undecided they
are simply to be ``grand jurors'' finding probable cause in someone
else's case.
</P>
<P>
   Baloney. If articles of impeachment pass, any yes vote will have
to be followed by several others this year and next, to appoint and
reappoint managers for the Senate trial and to pay for it with
taxpayers' money.
</P>
<P>
   The result will make a yes vote in fact a vote to become part of
the prosecution, to sign onto the effort to remove the president
from office, to be responsible for a case Hyde was too lazy and
partisan to even investigate. Talk about walking off a cliff!

BY PHONE AND E-MAIL, THE PUBLIC LOBBIES HARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Phone lines to the Capitol were so jammed Monday
that the National Organization for Women urged its members to call
lawmakers in their home districts. Electronic mail was so heavy
that it overwhelmed two of Congress's computers. Over the weekend,
so many people called Washington that they threatened to shut down
a main switch on Bell Atlantic Corp.'s phone network.
</P>
<P>
   As the House moves toward a scheduled vote Thursday on whether
to impeach President Clinton, the capital is awash in phone calls,
e-mails, and petitions from the public. And the lobbying will get
only heavier, as interest groups and media outlets generate even
more calls in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   While there is no evidence yet that the lobbying has swayed
lawmakers, the group People for the American Way, which opposes
impeachment, is running phone banks in Boston, New York, and Los
Angeles to urge its 300,000 members to contact their
representatives. The group Monday also unveiled a $75,000 radio ad
campaign in four cities that is aimed at 11 undecided Republican
House members.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO, long quiet on impeachment, Monday called on union
leaders to oppose Clinton's removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   From Berkeley, Calif., a husband-wife team has amassed thousands
of petitions over the Internet _ more than 300,000, by their count
_ that urge Congress to censure Clinton and allow the country to
``move on.'' Paper copies of the petition, which can be found at
www.moveon.org, will be delivered to lawmakers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing for impeachment, the Christian Coalition says it has
collected more than a quarter-million signatures on a petition that
calls on Congress to ``hold President Clinton accountable'' for his
actions. The coalition has posted the petition on its Web site,
www.cc.org.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our members are phoning, e-mailing, faxing, making personal
visits to the district offices,'' said Randy Tate, executive
director of the group. ``We haven't had to do much to push them.
That would be like trying to speed up a rock slide.''
</P>
<P>
   What remains unclear, however, is whether all this lobbying is
changing any minds.
</P>
<P>
   Some congressional offices are so swamped they are logging calls
only from the lawmaker's own constituents. ``I can guarantee the
effect from people who are not in Iowa is zero,'' said Barbara
Levering, press secretary to Representative Greg Ganske, an Iowa
Republican. ``He doesn't even know about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, many lawmakers, such as Ganske, have already announced
their position on impeachment, and they are unlikely to change
their minds. ``I hate to say anything is impossible, but he put a
great deal of thought into it already,'' Levering said of Ganske,
who favors impeachment. ``He's already talked to an awful lot of
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Neil Volz, who works for Representative Bob Ney, an Ohio
Republican who is undecided on impeachment, said Ney ``is not
necessarily going to stick his finger in the wind'' as he makes up
his mind. The congressman is talking to legal scholars as well as
to constitutents, and he has asked to speak with Clinton's own
lawyer, White House counsel Charles F.C. Ruff.
</P>
<P>
   Volz said Ney's office received 7,000 e-mails and hundreds of
phone calls over the weekend, and opinion has been running 8-to-1
in favor of impeachment. However, when staff Monday morning began
giving callers a list of options that included censure, 60 percent
chose censure over impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Levering said 70 percent of callers to Ganske's office favored
impeachment, with 30 percent opposed.
</P>
<P>
   The major business lobbies in Washington say they are staying
out of the impeachment battle. Labor unions, however, are becoming
active. At the AFL-CIO, President John Sweeney Monday night faxed a
letter to union leaders to urge them to fight impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been staying out of this on the premise that it was
going to be a reasonable process, but the process has gotten so out
of control and become totally partisan,'' said Peggy Taylor,
legislative director for the labor organization.
</P>
<P>
   Social activists have been the most vocal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defend Truth. Defend Honor,'' said a pro-impeachment group
called American Renewal in a full-page ad in Monday's Roll Call, a
newspaper read by Capitol Hill staff and lawmakers. American
Renewal is led by Gary Bauer, best known as a domestic policy
adviser to President Reagan and president of the conservative
Family Research Council.
</P>
<P>
   American Renewal has also sent faxes to 4,000 of its most active
supporters, urging them to call lawmakers, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, president of the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition,
announced a ``prayer vigil'' outside the Capitol on Thursday as
lawmakers debate the impeachment articles. ``We're calling to stop
the impeachment process,'' said Dina Anderson, spokeswoman for the
group.
</P>
<P>
   NOW, which opposes impeachment, has asked its local chapters to
urge its 200,000 members to call lawmakers. The women's group also
says it has sent an alert to 8,000 members by e-mail and to several
hundred people by fax.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday and Saturday, so many people called lawmakers and
media outlets in Washington that Bell Atlantic could not handle all
the traffic. Overloaded phone circuits are not unusual in
Washington, but a Bell Atlantic spokesman said the volume was so
heavy those two days that it threatened to shut down a switching
center. At one point, the company logged 15,000 calls in 5 minutes,
compared to about 500 calls normally.
</P>
<P>
   Michel Daley, the Bell Atlantic spokesman, said most of the
traffic was generated by C-Span, which posted phone numbers for
viewer opinion lines during the House Judiciary Committee
impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, People for the American Way was sponsoring a
toll-free number that allowed callers to reach the Capitol
switchboard and lawmakers' offices. People had used the number to
make 86,000 calls as of Friday evening, a spokeswoman for the group
said.
</P>
<P>
   Carole Shields, president of People for the American Way, said
the group would run radio ads Wednesday and Thursday in
Philadelphia, New York, the District of Columbia, and Columbus,
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The ads aim to sway the following Republican lawmakers to oppose
impeachment: Representatives Michael Castle of Delaware, Jon Fox
and James Greenwood of Pennsylvania, Christopher Smith of New
Jersey, Rick Lazio of New York, Nancy Johnson of Connecticut,
Constance Morella of Maryland, and Deborah Pryce, David Hobson, and
Ney of Ohio.

NINE N.Y. HOLDOUTS COULD COME TO CLINTON'S RESCUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK - President Clinton has long treated New York as if it
were his favorite state. Now New York has the chance to return the
favor.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton avoids impeachment by the House of Representatives
this week, he may owe his escape to New Yorkers _ not least,
curiously, to New York Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 47 House Republicans reported to be wavering or opposed
to impeachment, nine _ more than one-fifth _ come from New York,
far more than from any other state.
</P>
<P>
   New York has always been a little different from the rest of the
country, so it only stands to reason that New York Republicans
should be a little different, too.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is unusually popular in New York. In the 1996 election,
he won 60 percent of the state's vote. More than that, he won all
of its 31 congressional districts, even the 13 that sent
Republicans to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every survey that's been conducted, locally and statewide,
indicates that New York State residents are opposed to the
impeachment of the president,'' Alan Eysen, spokesman for the
Republican committee in Suffolk County, Long Island, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   During last month's congressional elections, Eysen noted, no
Republican here dared bring up the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Mercurio, a leading Republican political consultant,
observed that few of the state's Republicans would risk much, from
either their voters or the local party leaders, by letting Clinton
stay in office.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato (recently defeated but
still influential), and New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani _ all
Republicans with national reputations _ have spoken out against
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``So how much cover do they need?'' Mercurio said of the state's
congressional Republicans. ``It's a comfortable environment to cast
a vote of conscience,'' as opposed to a vote of party-line
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, fully understanding the importance of the New York
Republicans, invited two of them _ Michael Forbes and Rick Lazio,
both Long Islanders _ to join him on his trip to the Middle East.
Forbes turned him down, but Lazio went. He told Long Island Newsday
on Sunday that Clinton came back to talk to him during the flight
over, but not about impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   While few of the nine New York waverers could fairly be called
``liberal,'' all of them hold moderate views compared with the
Republicans who dominate Congress today _ and they have voted
against the party leadership, and with Clinton, on a number of
high-profile issues.
</P>
<P>
   Even more than most, New York is a state of immigrants _ Pataki
himself is a second-generation American _ so almost no politician
here can afford to buy into the national party's policies which
many immigrants and their advocates find offensive.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a state where unions are still powerful and where the
economy _ especially upstate and on Long Island _ has not
experienced the full benefit of the national recovery from
recession. So few politicians _and none of the nine waverers _ can
swallow whole the national party line on the minimum wage, welfare,
or health care.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the nine also come from districts dominated by water _
Forbes from the eastern shore of Long Island, Sue Kelly and
Benjamin A. Gilman from the reservoirs of the Hudson Valley _ so
they have also been inclined to vote with Democrats on
environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   Gilman and Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, another of the nine, are
among the last of the ``Rockefeller Republicans,'' the label given
to GOP moderates who modeled their positions on longtime New York
Gov. Nelson Rockefeller's. It's a wing of the party that is nearly
extinct in most of the country, but it still flies in large
sections of this state.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman of the House International Relations Committee and a
diehard opponent of his party's isolationist tendencies, Gilman has
also supported Clinton's position on foreign aid and free-trade
treaties.
</P>
<P>
   One of the three firm impeachment opponents, Rep. Jack Quinn,
from the Buffalo area, has voted against his party not only on
labor issues but also on gun control. In 1994, he briefly signed on
to Newt Gingrich's ``Contract with America,'' and started voting
accordingly, but returned to his independent stances after local
opponents started winning points by calling him a Gingrich clone.
</P>
<P>
   Another opponent, Rep. Amo Houghton, is a former chief executive
officer of Corning Glass Works, and not only holds liberal views on
trade, abortion rights, gun control, and the National Endowment for
the Arts, but was one of only 11 Republicans in the entire House
who opposed the GOP's 1995 tax-cut package.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Peter King, the third anti-impeachment stalwart, is more
conservative than the others, but he is also an Irish-American who
supports the Irish Republic Army above much else and is beholden to
Clinton for his work on a settlement in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nine, these three have set their opposition to
impeachment in stone, but the other six confirmed through aides or
spokesmen Monday that they remain undecided. Their political views
and the nature of their constituencies indicate that they are
accustomed to bucking the party line now and then _ but this does
not mean they will do so this time. A few, including Lazio and
Forbes, are rumored in some Republican circles to be leaning in
favor of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Aides in all six offices reported Monday receiving ``a lot'' of
phone calls from constituents. Most said they had not yet tabulated
the results, but aides for Forbes and Lazio calculated the calls as
running 60-40 against impeachment. An aide to Forbes added that his
office had received, by late Monday afternoon, about 1,400 calls.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican county leader, who asked not to be identified,
said he doubted any of the nine would see their careers decided,
one way or the other, by the impeachment vote. First, the next
election is two years' off. Second, all nine won their last
elections by huge margins _ most carrying around two-thirds of the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   However, another Republican noted that the state Conservative
Party was pushing for impeachment and, in several districts, it is
hard for a Republican to win conclusively without winning that
party's endorsement, too.

IAIN PEARS'S COLORFUL PLOT AND CREEPY STEW OF CHARACTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FIONA LUIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
DEATH AND RESTORATION 
By Iain Pears 
Scribner, 223 pp., $22 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sustaining the tension inherent in the taut plot lines of a
mystery novel can be something of a tightrope act. Weaving an
entertaining yarn whilst performing this feat is an act of even
higher grace, and it is one Iain Pears pulls off deftly in ``Death
and Restoration.'' The sixth installment in his Jonathan Argyll
mystery series, it stands solidly on its own, not requiring
previous introduction to the character of Argyll, an art dealer
turned lecturer in Baroque studies.
</P>
<P>
   Pears, an English journalist and art historian, employed his
canny knowledge to pen the five previous art-world crime novels,
forebears to ``Death and Restoration.'' He is also the author of
``An Instance of the Fingerpost,'' a literary thriller published to
raves last year.
</P>
<P>
   The acclaim is well deserved: Pears exhibits quite a masterful
touch at suspenseful storytelling. Here, he has melded the story of
a relationship between Argyll and his fiancee _ Flavia di Stefano,
who works for Rome's Art Theft Squad _ with the mystery of an icon
missing from the chapel of the monastery of San Giovanni.
</P>
<P>
   When di Stefano receives a tip that a theft is imminent, Argyll
is keen to lend his expertise. The target, all assume, must be a
painting attributed to Caravaggio, since the monastery's only other
art holding is a seemingly ordinary Madonna. But of course the plot
thickens.
</P>
<P>
   First, there is the prickly matter of dissension within the
ranks of San Giovanni's monks. Their leader, Father Xavier, 39th
head of the Order of St. John the Pietist, wants to rebuild the
order; but to do so he needs to raise money by selling the
monastery's assets, the supposed Caravaggio among them. His
proposals cause turmoil, with the monks diverging into two camps.
</P>
<P>
   Second, a notorious English art thief named Mary Verney arrives
in Italy, raising the hackles of Argyll and di Stefano, whose paths
have crossed Verney's before. Could Verney be in Rome
professionally, sniffing out the treasures of the monastery rather
than as a mere tourist? Is she motivated by a more personal, dire
need?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the couple is unclear about the role of Daniel
Menzies, dubbed ``the Rottweiler of Restoration.'' Menzies has been
hired to return luster to the Caravaggio in the dusty chapel, which
also shelters the icon of the Virgin and Child, long revered by the
locals for its powers of protection. Adding to the creepy stew of
characters is one Peter Burckhardt, a French gallery owner known as
a top-notch expert on icons.
</P>
<P>
   Like daubs on a canvas, these colorful plot strokes blend
together against the backdrop of a city rendered as ancient,
secretive, and grudge-driven. Pears smartly allows each character
to connect disparate areas of dots, as it were, and a picture of
sorts begins to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   A brutal attack on Father Xavier in the chapel at San Giovanni
heightens the tension, and Argyll and di Stefano kick into high
gear; while di Stefano tails Verney and fills in a few blanks,
Argyll's sleuthing leads him to Father Charles, an elderly and
senile member of the order who weaves a fantastic tale: the stolen
painting of the Madonna, raves the priest, is one that was
reputedly painted by St. Luke, and it is in fact the supreme emblem
of the Byzantine empire.
</P>
<P>
   As Pears distinguishes fact from fiction, crimes, misdemeanors,
and history combine to unleash a series of events that culminate in
tidy resolution. It is to Pears's great credit that the textured
paths of modern-day mystery, ancient empires, and religious faith
collide so effortlessly. Clearly, his training as both journalist
and art historian make for a finely tuned duet. He writes clearly,
persuasively, and with a hand guided by touches of sentimentality
as well as mischief.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, once all the dots are connected, ``Death and
Restoration'' leaves a memorable, satisfying imprint. We have
Pears's subtle technique of mixing intrigue with intelligence to
thank for that.

 UNDATED: ... short supply.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``In most cases still, regardless of who is the greatest
breadwinner, men are still in control of the financial documents
that relate to the marriage,'' says Carole Goldstein McKay, the
lawyer who produced the divorce videos, which cover such topics as
how to discover hidden family income and how to avoid falling into
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had women who have come to me who manage million-dollar
portfolios for others and they can't tell me what their husbands
make a year. I started to realize that women were uniquely
disadvantaged during the divorce process. And what that creates is
a situation where women fold too soon, because they can't afford to
go the distance. When the time comes, you see women spending one or
two years and $10,000 trying to gather information that is
otherwise hers for free if she'd only known how to find it.
</P>
<P>
   But paperwork isn't all that's making divorcing women tremble.
There's the goings-on in divorce court itself, that end stop of
soured matrimonial dreams. More than ever before, says Cherny,
``there's a high level of animosity in litigation tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   He and other local lawyers recount stories of clients' cases
being endlessly delayed by a spouse's stalling tactics, by clients
being goaded and intimidated by their spouse's attorney _ riling
them in court, for example, in an attempt to prove they are
hot-tempered and thus unfit as parents.
</P>
<P>
   They describe litigation that is sometimes merely just
``symbolic.'' Says Cherny: ``You see custody battles launched not
for the child's best interests, but to exploit weakness in the
spouse. I've seen fathers who travel three days a week and clearly
have no ability to care for their kids on a daily basis, yet
they'll file for full custody, either to get leverage and put the
fear of God in the mother, or to get her to accede to his demands
on the financial end.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One such divorce court victim is Beth McDonough of South Boston,
whose four-year divorce case, finalized two years ago, went on
almost as long as her five-year marriage. McDonough, 40, challenged
her husband in court for custody of their daughter and for child
support. In the end, she got both, but the endless litany of
motions, hearings, orders, contempts, and abortive attempts at
pretrial conferences, which numbered in the hundreds, started to
wear out even the judge. Justice Anthony R. Nesi of Suffolk Probate
and Family Court noted in his findings that ``the papers, excluding
over sixty trial exhibits, fill over one large court filing tin''
and that her ``husband's huge attorney fees are due, in part, to
his inability to accept anything less than victory.'' ``The court
process, she says, ``made me emotionally bankrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   It is to avert such bankruptcy that these proactive self-help
manuals are being written, and they leave no strategies to chance.
</P>
<P>
   Want to outsmart your adulterous husband and defame his
character in court? Sooho's and Fuchs's ``Tao of Divorce'' offers
tactics to prove he's philandering, including: ``Look for any
suspicious (banking) activities, such as repeated withdrawals of
sums such as $505, suggesting conversion to travelers checks for
$500 plus a 1 percent fee of $5.00.''
</P>
<P>
   Want to convince the judge you're a morally responsible parent?
Abrahms and Smith offer instruction in courtroom etiquette: Don't
laugh in court, especially when your husband speaks. Don't show
anger in court because it could just as easily be directed at your
child. Don't wear a short skirt, because it will undermine your
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, these divorce experts say, be sure to do every bit of
your homework. ``Women need to be prepared,'' Abrahms says. ``I
think women can be naive about divorce, and I think being naive is
going to handicap them. It's not such a modern world when it comes
to divorce.''

TIPS ON HOW TO WIN IN DIVORCE COURT &QL; 
Three orders of battle &QL; 
 &QL; 
How to find your husband's hidden assets &QL; 
--If your husband keeps ``hard'' assets, such as gold, or coin and
stamp collections, search your house for secret hiding places
including home safes, employing a locksmith if necessary. Look for
evidence of accounts with private vault companies and self-storage
firms. &QL; 
How to trace your husband's potential adulterous behavior (a
strategy that could help to undermine claims he is the more fit
parent in custody disputes.) &QL; 
--Look for evidence of an athletic club membership (he's firming
up); of stress management seminars (from the stress of juggling two
women at once); of florist bills, jewelry receipts, unframiliar
sets of keys, and mail box rentals. &QL; 
From ``Tao of Divorce: A Woman's Guide to Winning'' by Sharyn Sooho
and Steven Fuchs &QL; 
 &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Strategies for Divorce &QL; 
 &QL; 
--The first person to make it to the courthouse has the better
chance of winning the divorce war. &QL; 
Never make a blackmail attempt upon your husband. A judge can hold
this against you in the final award of property. &QL; 
--Never confide your plan to a relative or friend, no matter how
close you are to them. And never write down your plan or keep any
written documentation that might establish a plan's existence. &QL; 
--In court, dress conservatively and act in a conservative manner. &QL; 
From: ``Divorce War! 50 Strategies Every Woman Needs to Know to
Win'' by Bradley Pistotnik &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
How to keep your legal costs down &QL; 
--If your lawyer bills in 15-minute increments and you need to ask
a question, go through his or her secretary instead. Ask the
secretary to ask the boss the questions, and have her get back to
you. &QL; 
Things that you should never do when dealing with lawyers &QL; 
--Use the same lawyer as your husband. &QL; 
--Be rude to or harass your lawyer. &QL;

GIFTS ABOUND FOR YOUR FAVORITE TRAVELER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everyone travels. Even if it's just ``over the river and through
the woods to grandmother's house.'' So, whether you know a world
traveler or just a family traveler, giving the gift that says
``travel'' is easy and fun, especially since this gift can bring
memories for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   For many, the gift of travel means spending lots of money, but
it doesn't have to. It can be a simple gift: a map, a flashlight, a
guidebook, a gift certificate toward travel, a game, a camera. When
it comes to travel, there's no limit to the ideas that will benefit
last-minute shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   I like small items that are easy to pack, handy, and useful for
lots of occasions. That's why the Olympus 35mm Stylus Epic Zoom 80
fascinates me. It's a real stocking stuffer, so small it fits in
the palm of your hand, but so big on features. Olympus says it's
the smallest 35mm camera in the world. This camera zooms from 38mm
to 80mm, takes great photos, is weatherproof, and does just about
everything, including autofocus, that those big, bulky 35mm cameras
do. It's a go-everywhere, do-everything camera. I thought I had
bought a great Olympus miniature camera years ago, but this one
outdoes that earlier Stylus. The Stylus Epic Zoom 80 retails for
$325; a DLX model for panorama shots lists at $345.
</P>
<P>
   For a much lower price, and a great gift idea, there are those
``throwaway cameras'' from Kodak and others, especially the
underwater models that are great for people snorkeling in the
Caribbean or elsewhere. The cameras, which list for about $20 on
down (I just bought a couple of gift ones at Stop &AMP; Shop selling
for $7.99, and with coupons from the Sunday paper cut the price by
$2 more).
</P>
<P>
   If you want to be lavish, get your traveler one of the new
digital video cameras that can fit in a pocket yet are packed with
features. Santa, I've seen them for around $1,000, if you get the
message. Another camcorder choice would be an 8mm one, a lot
smaller than those VHS models, just as easy to use, and with two
hours or more of recording on one tape. These start at under $500.
</P>
<P>
   Since family travel means kid travel, getting something to keep
them amused in the back seat is the key to a great outing. One idea
is a hand-held electronic game that can be played by one or more.
Hasbro has some nice ones out this year: kid favorites like Mr.
Potato Head and Candy Land Adventure designed for small hands to
entertain and teach skills such as counting. For older kids, there
are Monopoly, Pro Drag Racing _ with trackside sounds and
vibrations _ and one that can be enjoyed by the whole car, Trivial
Pursuit Electronic Hand-Held Best of Genus Edition with 3,600
trivia questions. The games retail for $13.95 to $24.95.
</P>
<P>
   Flashlights may not seem a gift item, but they can be very
useful on the road. Lumatec offers some great ones that are
credit-card size called FlashCard. They offer lots of light, even
have a pocket to carry a credit card or other item, and come in 45
designs. The FlashCards are $6.95; buy three and you get a free
T-shirt, plus there's a contest that offers a trip for two around
the world. If you can't find FlashCards in a store, call
800-776-7945.
</P>
<P>
   Maps are another great gift idea. Rand McNally has a MapGuide
series to popular destinations. These offer both a map and a guide,
and can fit in a pocket. The guides are $5.95 each.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of travel-related gift ideas can be found from Travel
Smith (800-950-1600) and Magellan's (800-962-4943), two large
California-based catalog firms specializing in travel-related
items. You name it, if it's for travel, more than likely they have
it _ from clothes and luggage, to first-aid kits, to comfort items.
</P>
<P>
   New luggage, especially a carry-on, would be a welcome gift.
With new carry-on limits of one or two bags, depending upon the
airline, and new limits on size, a carry-on that meets the new
rules is a great idea. Tilley Endurables, a Canadian manufacturer
of travel and adventure wear, claims its Tilley Travel'Aire bag
meets airline specs while offering a ``cavernous'' main compartment
along with extra pockets for small items. It's designed to be worn
over the shoulder or as a backpack. It's one of six bags priced
from $39 to $175. For details, call 800-ENDURES.
</P>
<P>
   To make the trip more enjoyable, Rockport, the footwear company,
offers the New Comfort Travel Kit ($40), filled with lotians and
other items to refresh and rejuvenate a weary traveler.
</P>
<P>
   Many travelers are heading for the Internet to do their
last-minute, a- click-or-two-away shopping. Both Travelocity.com
and MSN Expedia are reporting higher-than-ever sales on the Web.
Expedia, which reported $8.5 million in weekly revenue following
Thanksgiving, feels such sales are indicative of consumers'
increasing comfort in purchasing on line. Expedia says it is
offering special prices on packages and cruises.
</P>
<P>
   Still stuck? A gift certificate can solve the problem quite
nicely. These are easy to pack, can be bought at the last minute,
and can be used toward a vacation or travel item. One company,
1-800-GIFT CERTIFICATE (800-443-8237), can handle requests for
certificates with one call, and they can be used at participating

THE REPUBLICANS' OVER-THE-CLIFF GANG 
</HEADLINE>

 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON _ The House Republican leadership _ at last out of
the closet and pushing hard to kick President Clinton out of office
_ is asking its undecided brethren to take a third walk off a cliff
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, right about now, they said: Vote with us on our
revolutionary budget, and push the president to the wall; we will
prevail, and you won't suffer.
</P>
<P>
   They were flat wrong. The government shut down, Clinton
prevailed, and the Republicans lost half their majority.
</P>
<P>
   This year, they said: Support us on our national campaign to
make the president's conduct our major issue down the stretch, and
we can increase our majority and make impeachment a slam dunk.
</P>
<P>
   They were flat wrong again. The campaign blew up in their faces,
and the Republicans lost another half of their shrunken majority.
</P>
<P>
   Off that sterling track record of taking care of their own, the
Republican leadership is now selling impeachment as proper, moral,
politically cost-free, simple, and quick. The undecided Republicans
who fall for the sales pitch again will give new meaning to the
concept of credulity.
</P>
<P>
   There are two main risks ahead for the roughly two-dozen
congressmen who remain truly undecided and incommunicado, roughly
triple the current margin Majority Whip Tom DeLay enjoys among
members with public positions:
</P>
<P>
   --The first is that DeLay's operation is blowing smoke at the
undecided by cooing that a yes vote will be simple and more of a
process vote than a vote to kick the president out of office. In
fact, it will require several additional voting acts, each of which
will tie the hoodwinked member even tighter into precisely the role
of presidential prosecutor that the undecided seek to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   --The second is that DeLay and Judiciary Committee chairman
Henry Hyde are also blowing smoke in trying to assure the undecided
that nothing in the evidentiary case will come out or come back to
bite them. In fact, the holes in this Swiss cheese case get poked
daily.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence that should scare the bejeezus out of the undecided
should come first, and two examples will suffice:
</P>
<P>
   1. In the perjury case based on Clinton's grand jury testimony
last August, the Senate trial an undecided House member will be
responsible for would have to focus on the ``nature and details''
of the infamous relationship. That means smut, and that means above
all Monica Lewinsky's contention that the president was as
amorously attentive as she was, and his that he was not.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to have even a shot at perjury on this grand issue
is through contemporary Lewinsky statements to others, some of whom
Ken Starr found. The problem _ apart from the obvious, human
interest she would have in not telling friends that it was all her
and no him _ is that Lewinsky also told her friends lies.
</P>
<P>
   The whoppers she told Linda Tripp about her first lawyer and
Vernon Jordan are bad enough. Imagine a Senate trial where one
friend recounts Lewinsky's assertion that the Secret Service
brought Clinton to her apartment; where two others say she told
them the president and she went at it in the Oval Office naked as
jaybirds; where a steward says she told of being invited to
Martha's Vineyard; where job contacts in New York said she told of
lunching with the first lady, who had offered to help her find an
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   2. Or, as Representative William Delahund discovered late last
week, imagine the Senate trial on the return-of-gifts issue. With
no direct evidence, the Starr-Hyde inference is that Clinton told
secretary Betty Currie to call Lewinsky, who handed them over on
Dec. 28 after getting the call from Currie's cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
   Just one problem, leaving aside the fact that Currie and Clinton
contradict her. Delahunt found an FBI report of a chat with
Lewinsky in which she puts the time of the gifts transfer at two
hours minimum before the phone call from Currie allegedly to
arrange it. Neither Starr nor Hyde ever lifted a pinkie to clear up
this flagrant contradiction.
</P>
<P>
   But the GOP leadership persists in telling their undecided they
are simply to be ``grand jurors'' finding probable cause in someone
else's case.
</P>
<P>
   Baloney. If articles of impeachment pass, any yes vote will have
to be followed by several others this year and next, to appoint and
reappoint managers for the Senate trial and to pay for it with
taxpayers' money.
</P>
<P>
   The result will make a yes vote in fact a vote to become part of
the prosecution, to sign onto the effort to remove the president
from office, to be responsible for a case Hyde was too lazy and
partisan to even investigate. Talk about walking off a cliff!

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BEDFORD, Mass. _ ``He's the old guy with a white beard and
white hair,'' said a scrimshaw artist in the national park district
of this seaport city, pointing the way to the whaling museum where,
downstairs, there he was, on his knees working among the giant
bones of a 65-foot blue whale.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Konnerth was positioning one of the whale bones on an
oversized scale to record its weight when he stood to take a short
break. His is no ordinary line of work: ``freelance osteological
and paleontological preparations.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: He assembles skeletons.
</P>
<P>
   The man and the whale will be the buzz of New Bedford for months
to come, and have been since the whaling museum came into
possession of the dead whale earlier this year. Now Konnerth and
his wife, Jean, who are septuagenarians, are painstakingly
assembling the skeleton for permanent display in a planned new
lobby.
</P>
<P>
   The skull alone, Konnerth found, weighs 3,470 pounds, and the
blue whale skeleton is expected to be the biggest such exhibit in
the world, a fitting addition to this city so steeped in the
history of whaling. The assembly, a work in progress unfolding in
open view, was reason enough for a day trip here, but there was
also much more to see.
</P>
<P>
   This time of year especially, if the weather cooperates and the
day is clear and blustery, is a good time to wander about the
historic whaling park, which is now overseen by the National Park
Service. It's easy to get here by car, easy to park, and easy to
take in in a single day.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a historic district that's still finding its way.
There are the quaint cobblestone sidewalks, the red-brick and
granite museums and other historic sites, but some of the
district's buildings are boarded up and for sale. That, however, is
part of the appeal. Instead of the high-gloss of some tourist
centers, instead of wall-to-wall T-shirt and novelty shops, there
remains a rough-hewn atmosphere to the historic whaling district.
</P>
<P>
   Within a 13-block area, there's a mix of museums and the real
working world, so that it's easy to dabble in history, shop for
scrimshaw or maritime art, dine at any of a handful of seafood
spots, and then walk along the waterfront. The piers that line the
harbor right off the park still constitute a vital port for the
region's fishing trawlers and boats.
</P>
<P>
   In the center of the park district is the Custom House, a
handsome Greek Revival building completed in 1836, where ship
captains came to clear their cargo. Less than a block away stands
the Seamen's Bethel, a chapel where whalers prayed before heading
out to sea. Like the city itself, the simple-looking chapel is
featured in Herman Melville's classic whaling novel, ``Moby-Dick,''
and hanging inside on the walls are tablets in memory of men who
died while at sea.
</P>
<P>
   During the slanting afternoon sunlight of a recent late fall
day, with leaves swirling along the grounds of these 19th-century
buildings, and with a church bell ringing out on the hour, it was
not hard to imagine this city in its whaling heyday more than a
century ago, when the New Bedford area was the nation's
fourth-largest seaport (behind New York, Boston, and New Orleans in
terms of the combined tonnage from its whaling and merchant
fleets). Just beyond the park district itself, up a hill, stand a
number of grand old mansions, including the Rotch-Jones-Duff House
and Garden Museum on County Street. The mansion was built by a
whaling merchant in 1834, and its formal gardens cover a city
block.
</P>
<P>
   Though we came in search of a dose of whaling history and lore,
we were surprised and interested to find that work is under way to
further explore and document the city's substantial role in the
Underground Railroad.
</P>
<P>
   National Park Service rangers last summer began combing through
old records to compile lists of antislavery organizations and the
names of antislavery residents and the neighborhoods where they
lived. Tunnels have been located and, in some mansions, secret
hiding areas have been revealed. Eventually, the Park Service hopes
to add such sites to walking-tour maps.
</P>
<P>
   Given its large port, New Bedford was a key stopover for slaves
en route to Canada, particularly those from South Carolina and
Georgia. Frederick Douglass and his wife lived for three years
here, from 1838 to 1841, after their escape from slavery. Two years
ago, a monument was dedicated outside City Hall to Douglass, who by
the mid-1840s was a leading abolitionist.
</P>
<P>
   But the work-in-progress with the highest profile these days is
the Blue Whale project. ``From my bench here I could look out my
window and watch them scrape the bones clean,'' says scrimshaw
artist Albert L. Doucette about the cleaning phase late last
summer. ``The bones were all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Doucette's shop, Whale's Tale, is on North Water Street, in back
of the whaling museum. And last summer, before the work moved
inside and into the hands of the assemblers, the Konnerths, a
number of volunteers scrubbed bones on the back lawn of the museum.
``It's going to be a big deal, no question about it,'' says
Doucette.
</P>
<P>
   Hit and killed by a tanker early this year, the blue whale was
discovered lodged against the tanker's bow as it entered
Narragansett Bay. Plans were already under way at the whaling
museum here for a new wing, and the National Marine Fisheries
Services agreed with the museum's pitch that a mostly intact
skeleton of the largest animal in the world would best be exhibited
hanging in its new lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Andrew and Jean Konnerth, who began consulting with museum
officials last spring. It was on Andrew's advice that the whale's
bones, stripped of most flesh, were then immersed in sea water
until September, to allow tiny isopods and zooplankton to pick the
bones clean. The couple works in an open space on the lower floor
of a museum already filled with harpoons, lances, tools, and even a
large scale-model whaling ship.
</P>
<P>
   The blue whale's bones still give off an oily smell, and these
days the Konnerths are weighing and arranging the bones into four
large, ``anatomically correct'' sections. Steel pipes will be used
to assemble the skeleton, and given the whale's weight _ each lower
jawbone is 640 pounds _ the bones will be ``mounted so the weight
is carried by steel.'' The couple will be positioning the bones for
the next several months, but the skeleton won't be hung for
permanent exhibit until the new wing is completed in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   This is the seventh _ and largest _ whale skeleton Andrew
Konnerth has assembled. Ten years ago, he assembled a humpback
whale for the New Bedford museum, and he has put together skeletons
for aquariums in Boston, Baltimore, Nantucket, and Hawaii. His wife
is an artist, while he is a biologist who specializes in skeletal
anatomy. Since the mid-1960s, he says, he's probably ``done 200 to
300 skeletons, from an 8-inch fish to a horse and a cow and now a
blue whale.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his competition in the field of whale skeleton
assemblers, Konnerth smiles and says, ``I've heard about a guy in
Florida. There aren't many of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple came from Dallas to work in New Bedford, but both
shrug when asked where they are now from. They are not really from
anywhere anymore, they say, having moved often in recent years to
work on skeletons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of us are of the philosophy that if we can move, we'll
work,'' says Jean Konnerth. ``We're gypsies.''

   ``We are expecting some more assassinations,'' a source close to
the Iranian security services remarked to me a couple of weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   When he spoke, Darioush Forouhar and his wife had already been
murdered _ but the latest grisly murder of three more Iranians had
yet to be committed.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Khatemi went to the United States to speak at the
U.N., to tell Iranian people to come back, to invest, to promise
them that in Iran everything is now done according to the law.
Forouhar's murder was an attempt to show the world _ and Iranians _
that Iran is not safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the demonstration of lawlessness has gone beyond even my
informant's worst nightmares. Mohamed Jafar Pouyandeh had been
missing since last Wednesday and his body was found only on Sunday;
the 45-year-old writer had apparently been strangled.
</P>
<P>
   Just four days earlier, another writer _ Mohamed Mokhtari _ had
been found on a garbage heap, also strangled.
</P>
<P>
   Forouhar, leader of the small opposition Iran Nation Party, and
his wife Pavaneh were both stabbed to death in November. A third
writer, Majid Sharif, also died last month, though relatives say he
may have had a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   But the Islamic Republic is clearly the victim of a very creepy
series of assaults on the country's newly liberated intelligentsia,
the sadism of the attacks as frightening as the threat it obviously
represents to President Mohamed Khatami who is _ lest it be
forgotten _ perhaps the most popularly elected leader in the entire
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody wants to destroy the civil society Khatami proclaimed
after his election last year and the usual suspects are being
fingered.
</P>
<P>
   The clerics who never accepted any deviation from Ayatollah
Khomeini's anti-western, theocratic regime _ the Supreme Leader,
Ayatollah Ali Akbar Khamenei, and his supporters _ obviously come
to mind.
</P>
<P>
   Who was behind the trial of Tehran's progressive mayor,
Gholamhussein Karbaschi _ a Khatami ally _ on dubious charges of
corruption? Who organized the stone-throwing attack on a bus-load
of American tourists last month? The ``Fedayin of Islam'' who
claimed responsibility was clearly a cover-name.
</P>
<P>
   Who planned the assault on Ataollah Mohadjerani, Khatami's
spokesman, who was pushed to the floor of a mosque after Friday
prayers and beaten up?
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed Rezai, the young son of a senior Iranian official, said in
the United states that Ayatollah Khamenei and his colleagues were
planning a coup against President Khatami. But the Iranian security
services have apparently not come to any conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   True, Forouhar had ``criticized Khamenei too much,'' as one
Tehran businessman put it obliquely. Before her death, his wife
Pavaneh had told the New York-based Human Rights Watch that the
couple lived in fear of being murdered, adding that they thanked
God each evening for granting them another day on earth.
</P>
<P>
   But one Tehran daily newspaper _ its editor no friend of the
Supreme Leader and its owner none other than the deposed mayor
Kharbaschi _ pointed out that the gruesome murders may be an
outside attempt to set Iranians against the Revolutionary Guards
and Ayatollah Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must remember that the CIA pushed small groups in Italy to
kill opposition people so as to sew suspicion,'' the Iranian
security source said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many people in the West who do not want our
president to succeed, who would like him to fail so that Iran can
be regarded again as a backward country full of what you call
`terrorists.' The Americans have not responded to Khatami enough
and some people in Washington don't want to see enlightenment in
Iran.''
</P>
<P>
   The killings have come when Iran's democracy is beginning to
take on a human and very real shape.
</P>
<P>
   A new reform party, the Islamic Iran Participation Front, has
just been founded by more than a hundred political and cultural
figures to stand behind President Khatami's supporters in
February's municipal elections _ a poll with a million candidates
for 250,000 local government seats which will give wide
decentralized powers to town councils throughout Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The founders of the new party include a vice-president, four
ministers, seven deputy ministers, nine journalists, a poet, a film
producer and two student union leaders.
</P>
<P>
   So broad is the spectrum of political debate that Iranians must
ead at least six newspapers to understand what is happening to
their country.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has taken Iran off the U.S. list of countries that
allegedly fail to fight the production and trafficking of drugs,
though given Iran's ferocious series of executions of drug barons,
this is not surprising.
</P>
<P>
   President Khatami's approaches to the United States have been
accompanied by new relations with the Arab Gulf states. Crown
Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia attended the Organization of
Islamic Conference summit in Tehran a year ago and now Khatami has
been invited to visit the Kingdom by King Fahd.
</P>
<P>
   Iran has meanwhile refused to be intimidated by American claims
that it is developing weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   And the Iranian defense minister, Ali Shamkhani, has warned that
an Israeli attack on Syria _ Iran's ally since the early 1980s _
will be met by an Iranian military response.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is an Israeli attack against Syria, we'll reply in a
way which the Israelis cannot imagine,'' he said in September, just
after the Iranians showed for the first time their Shehab-3 missile
which has a minimum 1,300-km range which could include Israel,
Turkey, the Gulf or even parts of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Iran still has its enemies outside its borders who
would be as pleased to see the collapse of President Khatami's
``civil society'' as his domestic opponents. &QL;

GERMANY'S 100 MOST IMPORTANT WORDS OF THE 20TH CENTURY

<TEXT>
<P>
   BONN _ While other countries are still struggling to erect a
fitting archway to the new century, Germany has completed its
millennium project a year ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   A jury of seven eminent persons from the German-speaking world
Monday unveiled their definitive list of the 100 most important
words of the last 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   From AIDS to ``Wolkenkratzer' _ skyscraper _ modernity is
distilled onto a small sheet. Between now and Jan. 31, 1999, more
eminent German-speakers will pen riveting essays on each word,
which will all be broadcast during the coming 12 months, and the
printed versions will be bound in a nice leather volume. Beat that,
Millenium Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe it can. One eminent female person in Berlin has
already spotted one blatant omission _ the list has ``peace
movement'' but not ``women's movement.'' Historians are also
feeling a little let down.
</P>
<P>
   Germans have been living in interesting times, so competition to
get into the top 100 was fierce. ``Fuhrer'' made it, as well as
``Holocaust,'' ``concentration camp,'' ``deportation'' and
``genocide.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nazis did not merit an entry, even though the foreign
concept of ``fascism'' got in. And whereas the ``Third World'' was
deemed worthy of inclusion, ``Third Reich'' was not.
</P>
<P>
   As befitting a century of wars, the list is weighed down by many
military terms. ``Panzer,'' ``Molotov cocktail'' and ``U-boat'' are
the epoch-making words. ``Luftkrieg'' _ aerial warfare _ is there,
but strangely, ``Blitzkrieg'' is not.
</P>
<P>
   From the Anglo-Saxon world the German language acquired several
treasures, including ``design,'' ``comics,'' ``jeans'' and ``sex.''
From contemporary politics, it has gained almost nothing except
``reunification.'' From industry, ``Volkswagen'' made it as the
only trademark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Currency reform,'' the creation of the mighty deutsche mark 50
years ago, obviously had a deep enough impact to be included in the
gallery of important words. But ``monetary union,'' due to take
place in two weeks' time, will have to fight its way into the top
100 in the coming century. &QL;

PONCE GLOWS AT YULETIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM A. DAVIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONCE, Puerto Rico _ Puerto Rico's second-largest city, and the
self-proclaimed ``pearl'' of the island's south coast, Ponce
proudly cherishes its traditions.This is happily and visibly
obvious at Christmastime and during the pre-Lenten Carnival, the
island's oldest and largest.
</P>
<P>
   A beloved traditional Puerto Rican handicraft that flourishes in
Ponce is the carving of ``santos'': wooden religious figures,
mostly of saints of the Roman Catholic church, to which a majority
of Puerto Ricans belong. The most popular santos of all, however,
represent the three wisemen or magi who in Spanish-speaking
countries are known as ``the three kings.'' During the Christmas
season almost every Puerto Rican house is decorated with images of
the three kings, and their feast day, Jan. 6, rather than Christmas
Day is the traditional gift-giving time.
</P>
<P>
   One of Ponce's best known santos carvers, or ``santeros,'' is
Domingo Orta. Now 56, Orta has been a carver since he was 10 years
old, making musical instruments as well as reliigious figures.
``All five of my sons are also carvers,'' he says proudly. His
small workshop in the village of El Toque, on the outskirts of the
city, is filled with santos of all sorts and sizes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do all the major saints such as St. Anthony and St.
Francis,'' Ortega says, ``but more than anything else, I do the
three kings.'' He also carves images of the Blessed Virgin,
including those of the dark-skinned ``black virgin'' of Montserrat,
an object of particular devotion by Puerto Ricans of African
descent. Santos made by esteemed craftsmen such as Ortega are
collectors' items, and he gets as much as $2,500 for a set of
hand-carved and hand-painted three kings figures about 10 inches
high.
</P>
<P>
   Ponce is at its liveliest during carnival, which begins with a
huge bonfire on Feb. 2 and ends with ``the burial of the sardine,''
a hilarious mock funeral procession through the town marking the
end of merry-making and the start of the somber 40-day Lenten fast.
Carnival revelers in Ponce _ called ``vejigantes '' _ wear large
and colorful papier-mache masks that are frequently folk art
masterpieces.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most famous mask-makers in Puerto Rico is Miguel
Caraballo of Ponce, whose remarkable creations are in many museums
and private collections. Three or four feet high, Caraballo's masks
usually represent fanatastic multicolored creatures that have
fearsome features and are covered with horns and scales and sport
extravagent antlers. ``They just come out of my imagination,'' he
says modestly.
</P>
<P>
   All signed by their proud maker, Carbello's well-crafted masks
will last 20 or 30 years if taken care of properly. Simple ones
cost as little as $60, the more elaborate and imaginative ones up
to $700.
</P>
<P>
   Only 75 miles southwest of San Juan but with a range of high
hills in between, a more tropical climate, and a distinctly slower
pace, Ponce seems far removed from the metropolis. It is a very
different Puerto Rico from the bustling cruise-ship docks of San
Juan or the tourist-crowded resort hotel strips of Condado Beach
and Isla Verde.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as colorful as one of Carbello's masks and a symbol of
Ponce's distinctive and joyful civic character is the ``parque de
bombas,'' the city's eye-catching old firehouse. Sited on a corner
of Plaza de las Delicias (Plaza of Delights) the main square, the
firehouse was originally one of the pavilions of an exposition held
on the plaza in 1882 to promote Ponce's industries and attractions.
</P>
<P>
   Painted in broad red and black stripes on the outside and with a
green and yellow interior decor, the old firehouse _ now a
firefighting museum and tourist information kiosk _ is impossible
to miss. Unique as the firehouse appears, Ponce actually boasts an
entire neighborhood with the same gaudy color scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Until comparatively recently, the local fire department was an
all-volunteer force. One of the inducements to volunteer was an
annual lottery at which a lucky firefighter won a newly-built
bungalow, one always painted in the same red and black stripes as
the fire house and with the fire department crest on the facade.
There are some 60 such small houses, all on or just off a street
called Twenty-Sixth of January: the date of a fire in 1899 that
would have destroyed the city but for the volunteer firemen who
risked their lives to extinguish the flames.
</P>
<P>
   The people of Ponce are extremely fond not only of their former
firehouse but also of the prosperous turn-of-the-century era that
it represents, a time when sugar was king and the city _ surrounded
by sugar cane fields and the island's chief Caribbean port _ was a
boomtown.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1692 the city is named for its first governor, a
grandson of Ponce de Leon of Fountain of Youth fame. As part of its
tricentennial observance, Ponce spent more than $400 million to
restore the historic district around the Plaza de La Delicias,
where most of the landmark buildings are concentrated.
</P>
<P>
   Among other nostalgia-enhancing improvements, modern
streetlights were replaced with old-fashioned cast-iron lampposts,
overhead wires were buried, and sidewalks were trimmed with local
pink marble. Today, Spanish colonial streets such as Isabela Reina,
Paseo Atocha, and Christina look much as they did early in the
century.
</P>
<P>
   Sightseeing trolleys give tours of the district during the week
and on weekends there are horse-drawn carriage tours as well. Tours
last over an hour, depart from near the Parque de Bombas, and are
free.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Ponce's public buildings and handsome mansions are in a
local architectural style known as ``Ponce Creole.'' Characterized
by red tile roofs and framed balconies called ``rejas,'' they make
Ponce seem more like a Mediterranean town than a Caribbean one.
</P>
<P>
   Several interesting museums occupy characterful old buildings
that are worth visiting for themselves as well as their contents.
Among them is the Museum of the History of Ponce in Casa Salazar,
an ornate mansion built for a local doctor in 1911 and a wildly
eclectic (but impressive) mix of neoclassical, Moorish, art
nouveau, and colonial styles.
</P>
<P>
   The museum traces Ponce's history from pre-Columbian times, when
the area was inhabited by Taino Indians, to the present with
interactive displays, changing exhibits, and many evocative
photographs. Among the odder artifacts: a large marble bathtub
custom-made for Samuel F.B. Morse, inventor of the telegraph, whose
daughter and son-in-law had a plantation outside town.
</P>
<P>
   A similar although more subdued mansion, also built in 1911, now
houses the Museum of Puerto Rico Music. Exhibits include Indian,
Spanish, and African instruments and memorabilia of beloved Puerto
Rican performers and composers.
</P>
<P>
   Ponce's most dramatic-looking museum, without a doubt, is
Serrales Castle, which stands near the crest of El Vigia Hill,
looking down on the city. Built in the 1930s as the home of the
wealthy family that owned the Don Q rum distillery, Puerto Rico's
oldest, it is a romanticized version of a Spanish castle. As a
museum, the castle displays the Serrales family's large collection
of antique furnishings and also has exhibits on the sugar and
rum-making industries that paid for them.
</P>
<P>
   Sharing El Vigia Hill with Serrales Castle is the remarkable
``Cruz del Vigia'' (Virgin's Cross), a 100-foot-high reinforced
concrete structure with lateral arms 70 feet across. Built in 1984
to replace the traditional wooden cross that had stood on the hill
for more than 200 years, the Virgin's Cross has an observation deck
on top (accessible by elevator) with a panoramic view of Ponce and
the lush green countryside around it.
</P>
<P>
   When agriculture rather than tourism was Puerto Rico's main
industry, Ponce _ the port through which much of the island' sugar,
coffee, and rum was exported _ rivaled San Juan as the island's
commercial and intellectual center. It still has an unusual number
of cultural institutions for a city of 200,000 people, including
the Catholic University of Puerto Rico, a School of Fine Arts
(housed in a restored building once local Spanish Army
headquarters), and the Ponce Museum of Art, the largest in the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of Art was founded by Luis Ferre, a wealthy art
collector and former governor of Puerto Rico. Located across from
the main gate of Catholic University, the museum is a large and
impressive building with roomy galleries lit by hexagonal
skylights. It was designed by Edward Durrell Stone, the architect
who also designed the Museum of Modern Art in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Ferre's artistic taste was definitely Eurocentric, and the
collection covers five centuries of mostly Western European art,
with emphasis on Renaissance, Baroque, and pre-Raphaelite painting
and scupture. There is a good deal of repetitive religious art and
a number of unfashionably sentimental Victorian paintings but also
some first rate works by Reubens, Gainsborough, Reynolds,
Velazquez, Van Dyck Cranach, Murillo, and other masters.
</P>
<P>
   There are also galleries devoted to Latin American art,
including paintings by Mexico's Diego Rivera and Puerto Rico's own
Jose Campeche. The museum has an attractive gift shop that besides
the usual postcards, prints and art books has a large selection of
handicrafts from both Puerto Rico and elsewhwere in Latin America.

   A good placee to buy local handicrafts in downtown Ponce is Mi
Coqui, a gift shop on Christina Street across from the firehouse.
Named for the tiny whistling frog who is Puerto Rico's mascot, the
shop has an entire wall covered with carnival masks and also has a
large stock of santos. Prices of handicrafts are generally much
lower in Ponce than in San Juan.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking is also a folk art, and Ponce is noted for its
traditional creole- style seafood. El Ancla (``The Anchor''), a
popular restaurant in a former warehouse on the Ponce waterfront,
for instance, serves seafood with a definite Caribbean flair.
</P>
<P>
   Specialties include ``mariscada'' (a lobster, shrimp, octopus
and conch combination,) ``mofongo relleno con langosta y
camarones'' (mashed plantain stuffed with lobster and shrimp), and
``filete de salmon en salsa de alcabarras'' (salmon filet in capers
sauce). El Ancla is one of the 43 restaurants on the island the
government of Puerto Rico has designated a ``mesone gastronomico,''
that is, a family-run restaurant serving authentic regional Puerto
Rican cuisine.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BONN _ While other countries are still struggling to erect a
fitting archway to the new century, Germany has completed its
millennium project a year ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   A jury of seven eminent persons from the German-speaking world
Monday unveiled their definitive list of the 100 most important
words of the last 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   From AIDS to ``Wolkenkratzer' _ skyscraper _ modernity is
distilled onto a small sheet. Between now and Jan. 31, 1999, more
eminent German-speakers will pen riveting essays on each word,
which will all be broadcast during the coming 12 months, and the
printed versions will be bound in a nice leather volume. Beat that,
Millenium Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe it can. One eminent female person in Berlin has
already spotted one blatant omission _ the list has ``peace
movement'' but not ``women's movement.'' Historians are also
feeling a little let down.
</P>
<P>
   Germans have been living in interesting times, so competition to
get into the top 100 was fierce. ``Fuhrer'' made it, as well as
``Holocaust,'' ``concentration camp,'' ``deportation'' and
``genocide.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nazis did not merit an entry, even though the foreign
concept of ``fascism'' got in. And whereas the ``Third World'' was
deemed worthy of inclusion, ``Third Reich'' was not.
</P>
<P>
   As befitting a century of wars, the list is weighed down by many
military terms. ``Panzer,'' ``Molotov cocktail'' and ``U-boat'' are
the epoch-making words. ``Luftkrieg'' _ aerial warfare _ is there,
but strangely, ``Blitzkrieg'' is not.
</P>
<P>
   From the Anglo-Saxon world the German language acquired several
treasures, including ``design,'' ``comics,'' ``jeans'' and ``sex.''
From contemporary politics, it has gained almost nothing except
``reunification.'' From industry, ``Volkswagen'' made it as the
only trademark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Currency reform,'' the creation of the mighty deutsche mark 50
years ago, obviously had a deep enough impact to be included in the
gallery of important words. But ``monetary union,'' due to take
place in two weeks' time, will have to fight its way into the top
100 in the coming century. &QL;

   JERUSALEM _ Hassan, a young Palestinian in Jabalya refugee camp
close to the center of Gaza city, was not happy as he waited for
the Palestinian leadership to drop the anti-Israel clauses in the
Palestinian charter. ``I want the refugees to be able to go back
before they change it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   These were not wise words on a day when Yasser Arafat, the
Palestinian leader, was straining every nerve to make a success of
the visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton to Gaza, the self-ruled
Palestinian enclave.
</P>
<P>
   Eight plainclothes policemen stepped forward to remove Hassan
for a quick interrogation over what he had said about the visiting
American leader.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians in the streets of Gaza were skeptical. Ibrahim Ali,
a money changer watched impassively as Hassan was arrested. ``The
Clinton visit may put us on the road to a state, but it does more
for (Arafat's) Palestinian Authority that it does for the people,''
he said. ``Gaza is still just one big prison.''
</P>
<P>
   None of these private doubts would have been evident to
President Clinton when his helicopter landed at the newly opened
Gaza International Airport Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The control tower had almost disappeared inside two enormous
American and Palestinian flags. Wall posters showed Clinton and
Arafat, apparently hand in hand, with the slogan: ``We Have A
Dream.'' Offshore, a flotilla of festively decorated Palestinian
fishing boats moved up and down the coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except for Monica (Lewinsky), nobody loves President Clinton
like Arafat,'' said an American diplomat cited by the Israeli
press.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton and Arafat addressed the Palestinian leadership in
the Shawwa Center in the heart of Gaza later in the day, Arafat
several times enfolded the U.S. president's hands in his own.
</P>
<P>
   In words that cast light on the importance he invests in this
visit, the Palestinian leader repeated: ``Palestine is reborn
again, reborn again.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian police and soldiers were making strenuous efforts to
ensure nothing might spoil the rebirth. All the streets in central
Gaza were closed to traffic. There were checkpoints every 200 yards
on roads far from where the American and Palestinian leaders were
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   A small boy with a Palestinian flag attached to the back of
bicycle who tried to drive down the road which goes past Arafat's
headquarters was rapidly turned around by three soldiers with
submachine guns.
</P>
<P>
   In Shati refugee camp, where Hillary Clinton was expected to
visit a women's center, Lt. Subhi Azami, who had grown up in Beirut
and had fought against the Israel invasion of Lebanon in 1982, was
directing hundreds of police and soldiers as they sealed off roads.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that Mrs. Clinton, unlike her husband, had said
she hoped the Palestinians would have their own state.
</P>
<P>
   Looking around at the narrow lanes and block houses, whose
poverty a last-minute cleanup did not conceal, he said: ``Maybe the
Americans will see how we are suffering here.'' As he spoke, two
Israeli jets soared overhead, emphasizing the limits of Palestinian
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   The anxiety about security was as much American as Palestinian.
Diplomats from the American embassy in Tel Aviv had moved en masse
to the Holiday Inn in Ashkelon just up the coast in Israel. From
there they have commuted each day for weeks to organize the visit.
</P>
<P>
   None have been allowed to spend one night in Gaza. ``You've
never seen such paranoia,'' one complained.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has walked down so many red carpets to meet foreign
leaders in the past 30 years that the people of Gaza are dubious
about how much good President Clinton's visit will do them.
</P>
<P>
   For once, their cynicism may be misplaced. On arriving at the
airport the American leader said the Palestinian people were free
to ``determine their own destiny on their own land.'' He cut a
ribbon to open the airport, though it was opened with great fanfare
several weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat is relishing the change in American policy towards the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago a senior American official, prematurely
assigning the Palestine Liberation Organization to its grave, said:
``Bye, bye PLO.'' Monday President Clinton was addressing its
leaders, all dressed in suits and uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palestinians see it as the beginning of the fulfillment of
a messianic vision and an independent state,'' writes Hemi Shalev,
the Israeli commentator. ``They are drunk with the smell of the
strategic revolution they have carried in their relations with the
American government.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's strategy has been to agree to everything the Americans
wanted. Monday he got his reward.
</P>
<P>
   He had signed on to the Wye Plantation agreement in October
under which he will get back only 13 percent of land on the West
Bank. This means that Israel will continue to hold one-third of the
Gaza Strip and 60 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech President Clinton praised the Palestinians for
continuing to negotiate when they had good reasons ``for walking
away.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time President Clinton sympathetically mentioned
Palestinian grievances such as the prisoners still held by Israel,
Jewish settlements, the confiscation of land and demolition of
Palestinian homes.
</P>
<P>
   He compared the grief of the children of Palestinian prisoners
to that of the children of Israelis who were killed fighting
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   None of this will be good news for Benjamin Netanyahu, the
Israeli prime minister, whose prolonged delay in implementing the
Oslo accords is blamed by many Israelis for changing American
attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   There was something plaintive in the way President Clinton told
the Palestinians that they should revoke the clauses in the
Palestinian charter.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton may suspect that the Israeli withdrawal from
another 5 percent of the West Bank scheduled for next Friday, is
not going to take place.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu is fighting for his political life. He needs the
support of the hard right to save his coalition in a parliamentary
confidence vote next week. He will not get it if the withdrawal
goes ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians in Jabalya refugee camp may be right to wonder how
many of the fine words spoken in Gaza Monday will turn into
reality. &QL;

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK _ By the close of bidding Tuesday afternoon, Thailand
will mark a watershed in the restructuring of Asia's crisis-hit
economies.
</P>
<P>
   On the auction block will be business loans worth nearly half of
the 860 billion baht ($24.03 billion) in assets seized by the
government last year when it shut down much of the country's
financial sector and closed 56 finance companies.
</P>
<P>
   The loans will be sold at a discount to their full value _ up to
60 percent, experts say _ to companies hoping to recover enough
money from the borrowers to make a profit.
</P>
<P>
   But the prices of Tuesday's bids are less important, several
economists said, than the demonstration that Thailand is
restructuring quickly under its $17 billion aid program from the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thailand is setting a benchmark for clearing out bad loans and
this auction will be watched throughout Asia,'' said Jim Walker,
chief economist of Credit Lyonnais. ``After sparking the crisis,
Thailand is taking the lead in cleaning up.''
</P>
<P>
   The rapid pace of Thailand's asset sell-off, which will largely
be complete if everything is sold Tuesday, places the country's
realignment ahead of Indonesia and South Korea, Asia's other two
recipients of multibillion-dollar IMF bailouts, according to Chi
Lo, senior international economist at Hongkong &AMP; Shanghai Banking
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Thailand is allowing foreign companies to bid.
Among those expected to participate are General Electric Capital
Corp. and Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keeping foreigners out of the banking sector was really a
sacred cow in the Asian model, but this auction is breaking that
system down,'' Lo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Korea, Indonesia and Malaysia really need this sort of auction
soon too, but the first two have not even set a date and Malaysia's
current policies would not allow it to take place.''
</P>
<P>
   Full economic restructuring, however, is far from complete and
faces mounting resistance from critics who say that Thailand, the
only country in Southeast Asia that was never colonized, is now
being sold cheaply to Western bankers.
</P>
<P>
   Led by a group of wealthy senators, opponents of IMF reforms
have already delayed passage of foreclosure and bankruptcy laws
intended to punish delinquent debtors by allowing banks to
repossess collateral.
</P>
<P>
   The laws, which the government attempted to pass earlier this
year, would have significantly increased bidding prices at
Tuesday's auction of unpaid business loans, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   The 13,192 loans have a face value of 371 billion baht, but
analysts expect they will sell for at least 60 percent less, with
as many as half not selling at all.
</P>
<P>
   The 15 potential bidders each paid 500,000 baht to examine the
loan documents. Brought together from the 56 defunct finance
companies, the business loans to be sold Tuesday have been
subdivided into 42 lots, each grouping an industry or type of
collateral, such as loans to hotels or steel companies.
</P>
<P>
   As a concession to complaints that the auction favors wealthy
foreign institutions, bidders can commit up to four times their
capital funds by signing up for several lots in order of
preference.
</P>
<P>
   The deadline for submitting an envelope of bids is 1 P.M.
Tuesday and results will be announced within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Unsold lots will be auctioned in a second round, in which the
government's Asset Management Corp. will participate. There is no
minimum price, but low bids will be rejected if authorities deem
them ``artificially low,'' according to Amaret Sila-On, chairman of
the Financial Sector Restructuring Authority.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how little money the auction raises, however,
knowledge of the prices will automatically push forward the next
stage of Thailand's recovery, according to David Fernandez, a
Singapore-based regional economist for J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   The amount paid for the loans will allow banks to estimate the
necessary level of provisions for bad loans and help break the ice
with corporate restructuring as the new creditors start talking to
the companies that owe money, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the process gets under way, I think we could see a rapid
acceleration in bank recapitalization and corporate
restructuring,'' Fernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   Walker of Credit Lyonnais, who was severely criticized by Thai
authorities last year when he correctly predicted the fall of the
baht months before it occurred, said early signs showed the Thai
economy had hit a pretty solid bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a yearly basis, the `headline' numbers are still way out of
the ballpark,'' he said, referring to the plunge in sales of cars
by 72 percent and motorcycles by 52 percent this year through
October.
</P>

<P>
   BANGKOK _ By the close of bidding Tuesday afternoon, Thailand
will mark a watershed in the restructuring of Asia's crisis-hit
economies.
</P>
<P>
   On the auction block will be business loans worth nearly half of
the 860 billion baht ($24.03 billion) in assets seized by the
government last year when it shut down much of the country's
financial sector and closed 56 finance companies.
</P>
<P>
   The loans will be sold at a discount to their full value _ up to
60 percent, experts say _ to companies hoping to recover enough
money from the borrowers to make a profit.
</P>
<P>
   But the prices of Tuesday's bids are less important, several
economists said, than the demonstration that Thailand is
restructuring quickly under its $17 billion aid program from the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thailand is setting a benchmark for clearing out bad loans and
this auction will be watched throughout Asia,'' said Jim Walker,
chief economist of Credit Lyonnais. ``After sparking the crisis,
Thailand is taking the lead in cleaning up.''
</P>
<P>
   The rapid pace of Thailand's asset sell-off, which will largely
be complete if everything is sold Tuesday, places the country's
realignment ahead of Indonesia and South Korea, Asia's other two
recipients of multibillion-dollar IMF bailouts, according to Chi
Lo, senior international economist at Hongkong &AMP; Shanghai Banking
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Thailand is allowing foreign companies to bid.
Among those expected to participate are General Electric Capital
Corp. and Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keeping foreigners out of the banking sector was really a
sacred cow in the Asian model, but this auction is breaking that
system down,'' Lo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Korea, Indonesia and Malaysia really need this sort of auction
soon too, but the first two have not even set a date and Malaysia's
current policies would not allow it to take place.''
</P>
<P>
   Full economic restructuring, however, is far from complete and
faces mounting resistance from critics who say that Thailand, the
only country in Southeast Asia that was never colonized, is now
being sold cheaply to Western bankers.
</P>
<P>
   Led by a group of wealthy senators, opponents of IMF reforms
have already delayed passage of foreclosure and bankruptcy laws
intended to punish delinquent debtors by allowing banks to
repossess collateral.
</P>
<P>
   The laws, which the government attempted to pass earlier this
year, would have significantly increased bidding prices at
Tuesday's auction of unpaid business loans, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   The 13,192 loans have a face value of 371 billion baht, but
analysts expect they will sell for at least 60 percent less, with
as many as half not selling at all.
</P>
<P>
   The 15 potential bidders each paid 500,000 baht to examine the
loan documents. Brought together from the 56 defunct finance
companies, the business loans to be sold Tuesday have been
subdivided into 42 lots, each grouping an industry or type of
collateral, such as loans to hotels or steel companies.
</P>
<P>
   As a concession to complaints that the auction favors wealthy
foreign institutions, bidders can commit up to four times their
capital funds by signing up for several lots in order of
preference.
</P>
<P>
   The deadline for submitting an envelope of bids is 1 P.M.
Tuesday and results will be announced within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Unsold lots will be auctioned in a second round, in which the
government's Asset Management Corp. will participate. There is no
minimum price, but low bids will be rejected if authorities deem
them ``artificially low,'' according to Amaret Sila-On, chairman of
the Financial Sector Restructuring Authority.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how little money the auction raises, however,
knowledge of the prices will automatically push forward the next
stage of Thailand's recovery, according to David Fernandez, a
Singapore-based regional economist for J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   The amount paid for the loans will allow banks to estimate the
necessary level of provisions for bad loans and help break the ice
with corporate restructuring as the new creditors start talking to
the companies that owe money, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the process gets under way, I think we could see a rapid
acceleration in bank recapitalization and corporate
restructuring,'' Fernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   Walker of Credit Lyonnais, who was severely criticized by Thai
authorities last year when he correctly predicted the fall of the
baht months before it occurred, said early signs showed the Thai
economy had hit a pretty solid bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a yearly basis, the `headline' numbers are still way out of
the ballpark,'' he said, referring to the plunge in sales of cars
by 72 percent and motorcycles by 52 percent this year through
October.
</P>
<P>
   By examining shorter periods and making seasonal adjustments,
Walker reckons Thailand's economy bottomed out last March. ``If you
wait for headline figures to change, you've already missed the
recovery,'' he said. &QL;

SOME HOLIDAY GIFTS THAT MAY BE LESS TAXING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD IWATA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The crazed holidays are here, but it's not too late to get your
money house in order. Here are 10 tips on year-end finances for
consumers and beginning investors:
</P>
<P>
   1. School yourself: Instead of stuffing your face, try feeding
your mind. Put down the egg nog and pick up Worth, Money or
SmartMoney _ three financial magazines with jazzy writing and
strong reporting. Watch ``Wall Street Week'' or CNBC market goddess
Maria Bartiromo.
</P>
<P>
   2. Give the gift of stocks: Not exactly frankincense and myrrh,
but precious nonetheless. Play Santa Claus on Wall Street by giving
friends and family some shares in blue-chip companies.
</P>
<P>
   Children and adults might enjoy getting stocks of their favorite
companies, such as Walt Disney, McDonald's or Microsoft. Instead of
throwing money at department stores, give retail stocks as gifts.
Retail shares could be good buys now, since they tend to dip in the
fourth quarter, then rise in January after positive retail sales
are announced.
</P>
<P>
   3. Trash those credit cards: Dump that plastic, which makes it
way too easy to buy until you die. One or two credit cards at most
are fine for emergencies and important purchases. Pay for
everything in cash, even though it's painful to watch that thick
wad of fresh bills vanish from your hands.
</P>
<P>
   Or practice safe shopping by using credit card condoms _ plastic
baggies to wrap your cards in. You'll think twice before going all
the way and buying.
</P>
<P>
   4. Help your favorite charity: Build up good karma and send a
check to a church, hospital or other nonprofit cause.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity's Charitable Gift Fund and Vanguard's Endowment Trust
are unique investment vehicles for the holidays. You can write off
a gift to the funds, watch the money grow for a few years, then
give the money to a charity of your choice.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can give a family member or friend shares of a stock
you've owned for more than one year. The share value is deductible,
and you dodge capital gains taxes on the stock sale.
</P>
<P>
   5. Eyeball your taxes: What spreads good cheer more than the tax
code of the Internal Revenue Service? Sorry, but this topic is
vital if you want to thrive financially.
</P>
<P>
   If you hate numbers, your tax expert can estimate your 1998
income, deductions, credits and exemptions. The goal: to shrink
what you owe the IRS. Tax pros do this in three ways: By deferring
your taxes to another year; by lessening the tax bite on your
investments; or by shifting your income to family members in lower
tax brackets.
</P>
<P>
   6. Bless your children and grandkids with financial security:
There's a wealth of investment and legal vehicles for passing on
money to loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   You can put a tax-free annual gift of cash and stocks up to
$10,000 into a custodial account under the Uniform Gifts to Minors
Act.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents start education funds for their young ones. Fred
Bellero, assistant vice president for investments at Piper Jaffray
Inc., a securities firm in Minneapolis, recommends a college fund
using conservative zero-coupon Treasury bonds. Investors buy the
bonds at a deep discount _ about 50 cents on the dollar right now _
and cash out at maturity.
</P>
<P>
   Also look at ``529 plans,'' the new state-run programs that let
parents invest tax-deferred money in their child's education.
</P>
<P>
   7. Polish your portfolio: Even though the holidays get frantic,
it's wise to review your financial portfolio for year-end tax and
investment strategies, said Annette Evans, vice president and
branch manager for Fidelity Investments in Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Other basic advice from Evans: Invest the maximum amount in your
employer's tax-deferred 401(k) or 403(b) retirement plans. And if
you're older than 70 1/2, make sure you meet your tax deadline for
minimum required distributions from your retirement funds.
</P>
<P>
   8. Look into flexible spending for child care or elderly care:
It's a gift from employers to wage slaves _ a helpful, pro-family
benefit called a ``flexible spending account,'' or FSA.
</P>
<P>
   According to Leonard W. Williams, a CPA in Sunnyvale, Calif., if
you're single or married and filing jointly, you can trim your
taxable income by moving up to $5,000 in pretax earnings from your
paycheck into an FSA. The cap is $2,500 if you are married and
filing separately.
</P>
<P>
   Then you can use that money for dependent-care expenses, such as
day care for your baby, or payments to a nursing aide watching your
elderly parent. You also can claim a federal tax credit for up to
$480 for care of one dependent, or up to $960 for two dependents if
you're married and filing jointly.
</P>
<P>
   The only catch of an FSA: If you don't tap all of the money by
the end of the year, the IRS says you must forfeit it to your
employer.
</P>
<P>
   9. To Roth or not to Roth? In general, singles qualify for the
full $2,000 a year contribution if they earn less than $95,000,
while married couples must make less than $150,000 combined.
</P>
<P>
   What sets a Roth IRA apart from a traditional IRA is that after
retirement, you withdraw your money tax-free. However, you must pay
taxes upfront.
</P>
<P>
   As a one-time carrot for consumers, Congress is allowing people
to spread out over four years the tax bite on converting their
traditional IRAs to Roth IRAs _ but it must be done this year.
</P>
<P>
   Beware, though, rules on the Roth IRA are confusing even tax
professionals. Check with your accountant or financial adviser.
</P>
<P>
   10. Buy absolutely nothing: Be bold, get radical. Don't blow a
cent on holiday shopping. Instead, pour that cash into a safe
mutual fund, and watch those dollars grow in the new millennium. It
beats a fruitcake or a Furby.

WORKERS TURN TO UNIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even as Massachusetts basks in economic prosperity, an
increasing number of workers have elected to organize to improve
their own economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
   During the past year, the national AFL-CIO reports, more than
175,000 workers across the nation joined AFL-CIO affiliated unions.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, between Nov. 9 and Dec. 11 a number of
elections took place to determine whether more than 1,000 workers
would become members of various unions. Most of the elections were
held under the auspices of the National Labor Relations Board.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, workers at the Westin Hotel in Boston voted, by a
margin of 294 to 190, to become members of Firemen &AMP; Oilers Local
3, a Service Employees International Union-affiliated union.
Workers at the hotel requested the union's help in their quest for
better wages and improved working conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Union activists consider the Westin Hotel workers' decision to
join the union, which hotel management fought staunchly, the most
significant union victory of the past two months. It is notable
because it was the first hotel in Boston to go wall-to-wall union
in at least a decade. ACORN, a community-based activist
organization, also did volunteer work to help the successful
organizing drive.
</P>
<P>
   Early last month, some 250 workers at Somerville Hospital voted
to join the Laborers Union. During the last week of November, 261
workers at NutraMax Inc. _ the largest cough drop maker in the
United States _ voted to join United Food and Commercial Workers
Local 328.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 3, some 234 service and maintenance workers at Whidden
Hospital in Everett voted to join SEIU Local 285. About a dozen
workers representing two smaller technical units voted to remain
nonunion.
</P>
<P>
   Two days earlier, 35 workers at Bay State Gas in Springfield
voted to join United Steel Workers of America. At Ace Glass in West
Roxbury, about a dozen workers recently filed with the NLRB a
request to hold a union representation election that, if
successful, will bring them into District Council 35 of the
Painters and Allied Trades Union. Also that week, 56 employees at
the Hanover Public Schools voted to join AFSCME Council Number 93
in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at King Painting Inc. of North Andover were scheduled to
vote on Nov. 17 to determine whether they would join District
Council 35. But the vote was delayed pending an NLRB investiation
of unfair labor practice charges. The vote also awaits the outcome
of a scheduled Jan. 26 hearing in Lawrence District Court on
alleged assault and battery charges against the company's owner.
</P>
<P>
   All of the elections, however, did not result in workers
organizing. In a close vote last Thursday, workers at Trendlines
Distribution Center in Revere voted 93 to 87 not to join Union of
Needle, Industrial and Textile Employees. Largely immigrant and
non-English speaking, workers there requested UNITE's help to
organize them, noting that many of the employees are barely above
minimum wage, although working at Trendlines for more than 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason an increasing number of workers have elected to
join unions during these good economic times may be that national
unions are communicating their message: Whether times are good or
bad, it is better to have a union as a source of strength.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these workers are also aware that during the good times
there has been a lot of downsizing and reengineering of companies,
resulting in many of them losing their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Also, most economic booms _ including the one currently in the
Bay State _ leave behind many lower-paid workers unable to
participate in, or benefit from, the prosperity. Perhaps the Bay
State workers who decided to become members of organized labor in
the past two months see unions as a vehicle that will help them to
at least catch the tail of the boom.

SIGNS OF THE TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPNTER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Travel across America and you'll see beauty, grandeur . . . and
silly signs.
</P>
<P>
   Loren Eyrich can testify to that. As editor and publisher and
writer of the offbeat quarterly publication, Two-Lane Roads, Eyrich
has driven his motor home more than 125,000 miles in six years.
And, oh, the signs he's seen. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   --``Jody's Used Tires, Guaranteed, One Mile.'' (North Carolina.)
</P>
<P>
   --``May Pop Used Tires.'' (Mississippi.)
</P>
<P>
   --``D &AMP; H Barbecue, Next to Hospital.'' (South Carolina.)
</P>
<P>
   --``Our bait is guaranteed to catch fish, or die trying.''
(Florida.)
</P>
<P>
   --``Fishing Bridge _ Closed to Fishing.'' (Wyoming.)
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the Florida sign that said ``No Sleeping on
Pavement.'' ``Do we really need to tell people this?'' Eyrich
wondered. Nonetheless, he liked that last sign so much that he used
it as part of the title of his new book: ``No Sleeping on Pavement:
Silly Signs and Offbeat Stuff from America's Two-Lane Roads.''
Along with dozens of signs, many of them displayed in photographs,
there are stories about fabulous characters such as ``Five Dollar''
Frank Thomas of Fayetteville, W. Va., who offers scenic flights
over the New River Gorge for just $5. And there is information on
where to find such oddities as America's smallest working Post
Office building (Ochopee, Fla.) and the world's largest catsup
bottle (Colinsville, Ill.).
</P>
<P>
   For a copy of the 112-page book _ a paperback, with the pages
printed on something less than deluxe paper _ send $13.95 to
Two-Lane Roads, PO Box 23518, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33307-3518 or
call 888-TWO-LANE. (The price includes shipping and handling, but
add sales tax if shipped to a Florida address.) For information

KYLE MCLAREN MAKES STRIDES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ While awaiting a new contract, Bruins defenseman Kyle
McLaren missed nine exhibition and 15 regular-season games before
signing a three-year deal Nov. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Since that time, McLaren, the team's first-round selection
(ninth overall) in the 1995 draft, has played 11 games (two goals)
and is just now feeling sharp. In particular, he has felt better
the last three games _ closer to tip-top shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rate it after each game I play and see how I feel after and
before the games,'' said McLaren, who last season had career highs
in assists (20) and points (25) and tied his high in goals (5).
</P>
<P>
   He missed all the hard skating involved in training camp, as
well as the time spent adjusting to your teammates, new and old. It
adds up to a special blend.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't realize that you miss training camp, your
chemistry is off and everything's off, your timing's off, and when
you step right back for a regular game, it's kind of a shock
because it's the next level,'' said McLaren.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys in training camp are trying to make the team, trying to
get their energy and conditioning up for the regular season and
they're ready to go. It's coming along. My timing is a little off.
When to jump or not, I need to play more games. It's picking up,
getting better.

   ``It's tough with no training camp, but I feel I'm a more
experienced player, a more patient player, and I can take things
other teams do. I'm still young (21) and I'm still learning, and it
can only go from here. I have a great teacher in Ray Bourque and
every day I learn something new from him and as long as that
continues, I won't be where I want to be for a couple of more
years.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an added benefit that the Bruins are 8-2-1 since McLaren's
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the team's winning, I think it's not a bad game,'' he said.
``I don't really set any personal goals right now after missing 15
games. It's kind of hard to. I just want to see the team win. If
I'm playing as well as I can, maybe I can help the team. There have
been ups and downs, like everybody else. I still have a lot of time
to pick it up and take it to another level. There are a lot of
games left in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's because of me or whether the team's
picking it up. I'm just a small part of this team, all 20 players
are doing it at once.''
</P>
<P>
   It certainly helps McLaren's cause that he's accustomed to coach
Pat Burns's defensive-style system.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't changed their coaching style one bit,'' he said.
``They expect 120 percent from you each game and if you don't give
it, you're not going to play. They're always on you, they always
want you to be at your best. You can have one bad game off and
that's not good enough for them. You need to be at your best for 82
games. They demand a lot out of you, so you learn to give it to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   At 6 feet 4 inches, 219 pounds, McLaren wants to be more
physical.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm not playing physical, it's not my game style,'' McLaren
said. ``While I was watching the team while I was out, they were
getting banged around a little too much, and adding my size the
last couple of weeks, the team's been hitting more and getting more
confidence.''

LEE KNOWS BETTER THAN TO MAKE A SNAPPLE JUDGMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SAYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's funny how the timing of these things works out.
</P>
<P>
   Monday Learning Co. said it would sell itself to number one
toymaker Mattel Inc., a deal engineered in part by Boston buyout
king Tom Lee and his partners. On the same day The Wall Street
Journal had a page one story on how another Lee company _ Snapple _
was finally bouncing back, four years after Lee sold it to Quaker
Oats Co. for an extraordinary $900 million profit in just 2 1/2
years.
</P>
<P>
   Lee didn't even get a mention in the Journal's report, but even
casual business-page readers know how the Snapple story came out.
In short, the 1994 sale of Snapple became a monument to how not to
make an acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Quaker paid $1.7 billion for a quirky little beverage company
just as the trend for its New Age drinks was topping out and
competition was pouring in. Then Quaker proceeded to do almost
everything wrong by dumping management, fouling up the distribution
network, and even cutting the amount of juice in the product.
Quaker eventually pushed out its chief executive and sold Snapple
for $1.4 billion less than it paid.
</P>
<P>
   Monday the market seemed nonplussed about the Learning Co. deal,
and some institutional shareholders grumbled that Mattel had gotten
the company on the cheap. Shares of Learning Co., which a year ago
sold a 15 percent stake to Lee and two other buyout firms, was down
12 percent, dropping 3 5/16 to 25; Mattel's stock was down a
stunning 27 percent, off 8 1/8 to close at 22, its biggest one-day
drop in 16 years. The Mattel sell-off wiped out any premium for
Learning Co. shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Is Lee again bailing out at just the right time, leaving another
big company holding the bag?
</P>
<P>
   Hardly.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Monday's swoon in the stock, this has been one sweet
deal for Lee, Bain Capital Inc., and a third buyout firm: The $123
million they put into the company in August 1997 will be worth
roughly $500 million in the Mattel buyout.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the Snapple deal, where Lee took the cash and went
home, Lee &AMP; Co. are sticking around. Lee and his partners, like
other Learning Co. investors, are getting Mattel stock for their
stake in the Cambridge software company and they are betting the
combined company has a strong upside in the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Toys are a tough business these days. Toys ``R'' Us and other
retailers are reducing inventories dramatically and putting
pressure of toymakers' margins. The Mattel sell-off was prompted by
the company's warning that retailers had reduced sales by $350
million this year. The company also reduced its profit outlook.
</P>
<P>
   Together Lee and Bain hold three seats on the Learning Co. board
and they think each company offers much to the other. On one hand,
Mattel has some of the biggest names in toys _ Barbie, Hot Wheels,
to name just two _ that Learning Co. can turn into software
products. On the other hand, Learning Co. has its own big brand
names _ Carmen Sandiego and Reader Rabbit among them _ that can be
pushed through Mattel's distribution channel, domestically and
abroad. The Internet offers particular opportunities for the
combined companies and their brands, executives say.
</P>
<P>
   Dealmakers, of course, tend to like their children and their
deals. Quaker loved the syngeries with Snapple, and then they
started merging the distribution networks and killing the ad
campaign that had worked so well for Snapple. Scott Sperling, a Lee
partner and Learning Co. board member, says that won't happen here.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are two great companies that have an even greater
potential together on a go-forward basis,'' says Sperling.
</P>
<P>
   (These guys are no fools: Knowing bad numbers were coming out of
Mattel, Learning Co. negotiated an unusually flexible arrangement
that will allow the exchange ratio for the deal to rise as much as
20 percent, depending on Mattel's stock performance.)
</P>
<P>
   The Learning Co. score is the product of a Lee-Bain
collaboration that worked before. Two years ago the buyout firms
combined for a profit of $400 million in less than a year when they
bought, then sold, Experian Information Solutions, a provider of
consumer credit reports. The same partners who put that deal
together _ Sperling and Anthony Dinovi from Lee and Mark Nunnelly
and Robert White from Bain _ also did the Learning Co. deal.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Lee &AMP; Co. knew when to take the dough and leave.
Now they are betting they have found a way to make their sweet
Learning Co. investment even sweeter. And that means staying put.

   MIDEAST-CLINTON _ JERUSALEM _ Mixing powerful symbols of
historic sacrifice and seasonal hope, President Clinton wrapped up
a difficult visit to this turbulent region on Tuesday, conceding
that the heart of the imperiled Mideast peace process is barely
beating and faces added strains in the weeks ahead. Hoping to gird
that process for further stress, Clinton pulled Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
together for a 90-minute meeting at the border town of Erez, south
of the capital. Nothing of substance could be resolved, however,
and the two men could agree only to activate a handful of
committees to take up a host of thorny security and law enforcement
issues and, ostensibly at least, to try to speed the flow of the
economic and social benefits of peace to some increasingly restive
pockets of Palestinians. Developing. (Deans, Cox News Service).

Palestinian children's choir in singing a hymn in Manger Square
against the backdrop of a towering Christmas tree. The sightseeing
stop in the biblical town of 50,000 just south of Jerusalem
provided a brief, joyful interlude for Clinton at the close of his
often troubled three-day effort to revive the Wye River peace
agreement. Developing. (Kaplow, Cox News Service). ETA: 4 p.m.

   IMPEACH _ WASHINGTON _ With their chances to stave off an
impeachment vote in the House dimming, President Clinton and his
defenders got more bad news today as a moderate New York Republican
who previously opposed removing Clinton from office abruptly
reversed course. ``The issue is about principle, not politics,''
Rep. Jack Quinn said in announcing he will now vote for
impeachment. ``My decision is based on the clear evidence of
perjury and obstruction of justice as presented by the House
Judiciary Committee in the last week.'' Joining Quinn was fellow
New York Rep. John McHugh, who announced today he will vote to

district home to thousands of workers with Shell, Texaco, Exxon,

FLINT FINDING HIS ZONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bruiser Flint knows that the word association game most people
play with UMass stilll ends with John Calipari.
</P>
<P>
   He also knows that despite winning 40 games in his first two
seasons as the Minutemen's head coach, he can still walk into the
living room of a recruit he is going after and be dismissed with a
wave and a smile as too young, not experienced enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see it,'' said Flint the other night, following a
solid 75-45 win by UMass over Boston College. ``I would go into
people's homes and you could tell, I didn't have a chance. John was
gone and UMass wasn't Kentucky or Duke or North Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Cal is three seasons gone now and Flint is finally
beginning to feel comfortable with what he's doing, as well as who
he is.
</P>
<P>
   That comfort zone has him smiling, even though the Minutemen are
2-4 after their first six games, with the chances of them going 2-5
after Tuesday's game at Villanova.
</P>
<P>
   That comfort zone lets him assert himself as he did on Saturday
night when he benched starting center Lari Ketner for breaking team
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Flint knows his players are watching what he does and how he
does things. He knows that he will be judged by a different
yardstick. Cal's recruits are fading from the scene and now Flint
must stand--or fall--on the strength of not only his coaching, but
his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure people judge you,'' he said with a smile. ``You expect
that. And if anything negative happens, you can bet they'll use it
against you in a heartbeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the situation with Ketner is dangerous. Flint can
not be too tough or the word will go out that he can not handle his
players. He can not be too easy or the word will filter down that
UMass is a program that has lost control of its players, who can do
anything they want.
</P>
<P>
   Flint has tried different things with Ketner. He has been in his
face and he has backed off, offering words of advice and
encouragement. In the face of Ketner's latest misstep, Flint
offered some soft words.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's trying too hard,'' said Flint.``He knows what people
expect.But in a lot of ways we're still dealing with someone who is
still maturing, we're still dealing with a kid in a lot of ways. He
knows there is pressure on him. He reads the papers.''
</P>
<P>
   So does Bruiser. He reads that his success of the first two
years was because Calipari left a program stocked with Top 20
talent. He reads that he has yet to prove himself as a coach--two
one and done NCAA tournament appearances have raised some eyebrows.
His recruits have yet to prove themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Starting 2-4 and perhaps 2-5 has not helped. Let's face it.
Calipari set a high standard of expectations at the Mullins Center.
His play anywhere, anytime theory of basketball worked to get UMass
into the national spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   When Calipairi left, lots of people thought UMass would fall
back down into the mid-major level type of program, where gaining
the Top 20 was more of a surprise than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what people were saying when Cal left,'' said Flint,
who received a two-year contract extension from UMass athletic
director Bob Marcum last week.``That the program would never be
what it was. It would fall apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? UMass may not ever get back to another Final Four. It
may be what it appears to be right now, a nice program that will
have winning records and make an occasional splash in March.
</P>
<P>
   But remember this. A decade ago, UConn was in a similiar
position. Jim Calhoun, who is still working to clear the last major
obstacle of never having been to a Final Four, has turned UConn
into a program that kids not only know about, but want to be a part
of as well.
</P>
<P>
   UMass can do the same thing. The Mullins Center is a first rate
campus facilitiy. The Atlantic 10 is a big-time league.
</P>
<P>
   And Bruiser Flint can be a successful big time coach.
</P>
<P>
   It will just take some time -- and patience.

 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMHERST, Mass. _ Use your play time wisely, children. Work
diligently at your hobbies. Don't take moments like recess and
Saturday afternoons in the backyard for granted. Truth is you never
know what talents may come to the fore amid extracurricular
activity, or how far you might go in life just because you're the
best kid on your block when it comes to saying:
</P>
<P>
   (itals)``OK, you go long, out toward that tall tree. You go left
and then cut to the middle when you reach the fence. You stay back
to block, because I'm going to fake it to you. And you go up the
middle 10 yards then turn around and wave like you're open. Ready?
Break.''(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, there was this sixth grader from Phoenix who used to
call plays just like that while playing sandlot football. His name
was Whipple. Mark Whipple. The kid had a passion for wide-open,
score-a-minute football. Only he discovered early on that he
couldn't run very fast. So he began figuring out the best ways to
get the ball to kids who were quick enough to run down the field
and get open.
</P>
<P>
   The kid's schemes worked so well in sandlot games that when he
began playing organized football, coaches allowed him to call the
plays. True story. From Pop Warner all the way through his senior
year at Brown.
</P>
<P>
   From there he decided to make a career out of calling plays and
honed his talents through various assistant and head- coaching
jobs. With his passion for the pass intact, he developed the
strategy while working under former NFL coach Roman Gabriel when
the two were assistants with the Arizona Wranglers of the United
States Football League.
</P>
<P>
   He bolstered that attack with run schemes he learned from the
late George Allen, former Wranglers and Washington Redskins coach,
and working as an offensive coordinator under University of New
Hampshire coach Bill Bowes.
</P>
<P>
   It is that same Mark Whipple who occupies the coach's office at
the University of Massachusetts, the program he took over last
December following the school's worst 11-game finish this century
(2-9).
</P>
<P>
   Whipple is responsible for one of the most dramatic turnarounds
in college sports history, as he guided the beleagured Minutemen to
a school-record 11-3 mark and a trip to Saturday's Division 1-AA
national championship game against 14-0 Georgia Southern in
Chattanooga, Tenn. (2 p.m.).
</P>
<P>
   It marks the second time in seven seasons Whipple has guided a
program to a national championship game. In 1992, he led the
University of New Haven to a 12-1 mark and the Division 2 finals,
where it lost to Jacksonville State. That team led the NCAA in
scoring offense (50.2 points per game) and total offense (587.7
yards per game).
</P>
<P>
   Whipple's 1993 team, which finished 11-1 and advanced to the
Division 2 semifinal, was named Sports Illustrated's Best Offense
in College Football, averaging 52.5 points and 557.6 yards total
offense a game.
</P>
<P>
   He also resurrected the Brown program, guiding it from four
losing seasons to 7-3 marks in 1994 and 1997 and 5-5 marks in 1995
and 1996. Last season, his Brown team set an Ivy League record for
total offense (474.3 yards a game) and Brown season records for
passing yards (317.9 yards a game), first downs (233), and
single-game total offense (629 yards against Columbia).
</P>
<P>
   Already UMass has set 30 regular-season offensive records and 24
postseason offensive records. It entered last week's game as the
third-best offense in 1-AA. The Minutemen have scored at least 21
points each game and have gone over the 40-point mark five times.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It all got started when Whipple played countless hours of
backyard, five-on-five, two-hand touch football when he was a kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going back, I've always called my plays,'' said Whipple, who
used to go solely on instinct until one of his assistant coaches at
Camelback High School, Bill Saunders, showed him how to set up the
run with the pass, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just kind of made them up, told guys to go here, go there,
go that way, and then I just made up names for them. The same
things we do now.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach garnered a basic philosophy to the game, and he hasn't
deviated. ``What it comes down to is this: If we throw the ball
well, if the quarterback plays great, we will not lose,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he plays great, we will be ahead by 35 points and then we
will run the ball. We throw to get ahead. We run to win. I heard
that said somewhere, and I guess that's what we try to do.''
</P>
<P>
   And it has worked. One of the primary reasons UMass is four
quarters away from a national championship is that very few teams
can match its offense score for score. Few defenses have been able
to contain the Minutemen for consecutive drives, let alone
consecutive quarters. They pass and they pass until eventually
something opens up _ and then the kicker marches onto the field for
the extra point.
</P>
<P>
   ``His biggest achievement with UMass is that he has taken what
was predominantly a running team and gotten a run-oriented
offensive line quickly adjusted to pass protection,'' said
Villanova coach Andy Talley, who was an assistant at Brown when
Whipple played.
</P>
<P>
   ``He changed the whole concept of what they were doing. Now
those run blockers knew they were going to be exposed to pass
rushers. It's hard to sell somebody on something like that. It's
hard to sell a running back like Marcel Shipp that he's not going
to get 41 carries a game, like (UNH running back) Jerry Azumah. But
he sold them on it early, and then they started having success
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Said fullback Matt Jordan, ``It's a complex offense in many
ways, but the comprehension of what's going on isn't if you know
what's going on in each play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot different from a lot of what he had in the past,
which was primarily a running game. This way it's a lot more pass
protections and releasing on routes. It's different, but the way he
teaches it, it's not difficult to understand at all.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all his attention to the pass, Whipple usually fields
teams with exceptional running backs and runs a comparable amount
of rushing plays.

   TAKE-BOS  
 AMHERST, Mass.: ... rushing plays.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Still it is not surprising that after its gut-wrenching 33-30
season-opening loss to then No. 3 Delaware, the only team to beat
UMass was Connecticut, which claimed two victories over the
Minutemen.
</P>
<P>
   UConn had the only offense that could match UMass point for
point. And Whipple, who rolled up 1,054 yards total offense in both
games combined, still believes UMass would have won both had it not
turned the ball over in each.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no different from when you play in the street,'' said
Whipple, about his offense. ``You want to win, you get your best
players the ball. And man must know his limitations. I was never
that fast or that talented athletically. So, hey I was never going
to be able to run 50 yards, but I better get the ball to someone
who can to get it into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``And how do you get that guy matched up? You run the out-and-up
(pattern) and then you run the out-and-out, and then you run the
up. Or you see things on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would see a lot of Arizona State games on TV, when they were
averaging 40 points a game. They were throwing it and you would see
the wide-open offense and the athletes they had. And then you would
go outside and put their plays in when we were playing street
football.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The drawing board behind Whipple's desk contains a partially
erased offensive play. When the coach is asked to put a fresh one
on the board, for the purpose of explaining the basics of his
offense, he is initially reticent. It is understandable: UMass is
on the eve of its 1-AA semifinal game against Northwestern State.
</P>
<P>
   So Whipple is asked to diagram a play he doesn't care for, one
he's never likely to use again. ``There is no such play,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Well, how about a play you absolutely will not run against
Northwestern State, or anyone else this season?
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' said Whipple, approaching the board. ``This play is
called Dig 39 Cross Shoot. This play worked very well against
Villanova.'' He draws 11 circles on the board, placing wide
receiver Jimmy Moore to the far right, receiver Adrian Zullo a few
inches away. Jordan is a few inches behind Zullo and Shipp is
behind quarterback Todd Bankhead. Tight end Kerry Taylor is to the
far left.
</P>
<P>
   The play is set in motion by several arrows: Moore's arrow is
drawn up the board. The arrows for Zullo and Jordan cross, with the
former going up and then to the right, and the latter curling to
the right. Shipp's arrow slants left then curls around left tackle.
Taylor's arrow is a long left hook.
</P>
<P>
   The play is designed to react to zone, man-to-man or blitz
packages without audibilizing. Any one of the skilled players can
receive the pass, depending on coverages. Bankhead, after taking a
five-step drop, must read the defense and judge the best matchup
within two seconds.
</P>
<P>
   And if one player runs the wrong route, if one offensive lineman
fails to block properly, the entire formation is thrown off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I tell them this play I have no idea what Bankhead is
going to do,'' said Whipple. ``I know what the coverage is, and I
know what he should do with certain coverages.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, I'll say, `Why did you throw the ball to Taylor?' and he
should tell me, `He had outside leverage.' The free safety was
deep. So you throw the ball underneath. If he's up, you have a
one-on-one matchup, Zullo on the rover, as well as Taylor. So which
guy do you want? It's a matter of what he feels good with.''
</P>
<P>
   And if they're all covered? If the play is run well, and no one
manages to get open?
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I got to go recruit,'' said Whipple. ``And that's what I
tell them. I'm just trying to take my best guy and put him on their
worst guy. But what we run is really not that much different from
what (Drew) Bledsoe is doing or other NFL guys are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is why Whipple is so confident in his offense. It is
adapted from some of the most successful offenses in pro football,
and learned from some of the best offensive minds.
</P>
<P>
   That includes Gabriel, who was an assistant on teams that ran an
offense similar to the popular West Coast attack. ``It was a
combination of what the Buffalo Bills did with Jim Kelly and Ted
Marchibroda and what (Tom) Landry did with the Cowboys,'' said
Gabriel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same thing you would see at Green Bay and San
Francisco, only 60 percent of the time we would run the ball using
a tight end, two outside receivers, and a running back out of the
backfield.''
</P>
<P>
   Whipple said working under Gabriel was like ``being in a lab
with a scientist.'' Gabriel, now a color commentator with the
Carolina Panthers, isn't surprised by Whipple's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would keep stats for me on and off the field,'' he said.
``He would do a lot of it on his own time, and he wasn't getting
paid a whole lot to get involved. We would be there at 2 in the
morning, breaking down film.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Whipple entered his senior season at Brown, he didn't call
his own plays. The highly touted quarterback was having a miserable
season when the coaching staff asked if he wanted to go back to
calling plays. He did, and Brown finished second in the Ivy that
season (1978).
</P>
<P>
   Talley said it wasn't so much his schemes as much as Whipple's
ability to get his teammates to believe his calls would work best
for the team. ``His greatest asset was that he was an outstanding
leader,'' said Talley.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the players, especially the offensive line, were very much
behind him. He would step into the huddle and whatever he called
the players would follow him.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, Whipple said getting UMass players to buy into
what he was selling hasn't been that difficult. They did even
before they saw the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing with this group, and I don't know why, is
that they haven't been satisfied,'' he said. ``That was my biggest
fear when I walked into the locker room after we lost to Delaware,
that they would be happy we played well against a team everyone
said we would lose by three touchdowns to. But everyone was sad and
heartbroken, so I said, `This is good.'
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had gone 6-5, everyone would have said they had a
great year. The Lehigh game was one of the biggest in school
history; they could have just celebrated and packed it in after
that against another team we were supposed to lose to. But there's
been no complacency. As time goes on, I'll look back and enjoy it a
lot more than I do now. They are just a special group.''

BATISTUTA ON EQUAL FOOTING WITH RONALDO, ZIDANE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the buildup to the France '98 World Cup, the Brazilian
striker Ronaldo was receiving more publicity than any athlete in
the world, much of it generated by a US sports apparel company.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Brazil met France in the World Cup final, Ronaldo
was unfit to perform. The speculation was so strong that coach
Mario Zagallo had been pressured to place Ronaldo in the starting
lineup that Nike had to issue a denial of any involvement in the
decision. Nike had a strong financial stake in the Brazil-Ronaldo
combination, and had greatly influenced the agenda of the Selecao
in the months leading to the World Cup. At the very least, the
residue of that influence affected the decision to include Ronaldo
in the starting lineup for the disastrous final game.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Argentina's Gabriel Batistuta was gaining
comparatively little attention. National team coach Daniel
Passarella actually diminished Batistuta's role in the World Cup,
and Argentina was eliminated by Holland following the 5-foot-7-inch
Ariel Ortega's incredible head-butting of 6-7 Edwin Van Der Sar.
</P>
<P>
   While Ronaldo has been force-fed to the media and the public,
Batistuta has kept as low a profile as has been possible for the
leading scorer in Argentina's history. Batistuta has been in the
background while FIFA and Champions League galas have featured
Ronaldo and France's Zinedine Zidane.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the awarding of the Pallon d'Or, European footballer of
the year, is imminent, a campaign supporting Batistuta has started.
Zidane is the favorite, and not just because the voting is
conducted by France Football magazine.
</P>
<P>
   But Batistuta backer Reebok has chosen to see if his actions
will speak louder than advertising dollars. After Batistuta scored
his 13th goal in 13 games in Fiorentina's 1-0 win over Zidane's
Juventus Sunday, the campaign could be gaining momentum. Fiorentina
surprisingly retains a 4-point lead over Milan in Italy's Serie A.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday Batistuta will play for a FIFA World All Star team
against Italy in an exhibition at Rome's Stadio Olimpico. The other
strikers will be Ronaldo and Milan's George Weah, both former
Pallon d'Or winners, and Real Madrid's Davor Suker, leading scorer
in the World Cup with Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   Batistuta will receive top billing, since his team is dominating
the standings and threatening the traditional power structure.
Ronaldo, who also converted the winner for Inter in a 1-0 victory
over Udinese, is still being coddled while recovering from France
'98. Batistuta is perceived as the dominant figure of Italian
soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if their roles have reversed, Batistuta told journalists:
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a question I can't respond to. If you think so, you
have to have the courage to write it.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate recalls classic Argentina-Brazil rivalries. Who was
the better player, Maradona or Pele'? Which style is better,
Argentinian pragmatism or Brazilian jogo bonito? Tango or samba?
</P>
<P>
   But neither Batistuta nor Ronaldo are of transcendent status,
like Maradona, Pele', or Alfredo Di Stefano. They are simply
attacking, go-to-goal strikers who would score goals in bunches in
any era.
</P>
<P>
   Fiorentina has discovered a winning combination with Edmundo,
who was slated to replace Ronaldo in the France '98 final, and Lulu
Oliveira, a Brazilian-Belgian, alongside Batistuta.
</P>
<P>
   They are guided by Giovanni Trapattoni, who earlier this season
replaced Edmundo with a defender, incurring Edmundo's wrath and
leading to the squandering of a lead against AS Roma. In the
Juventus game, Edmundo played the entire match, indicating
Trapattoni's policies have changed to fit his players. Edmundo and
Oliveira provided the pyrotechnics, but Batistuta made the
difference, heading in Oliveira's cross early in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Batistuta then celebrated with what has become his trademark
machine gun imitation, though it now seems to be evolving into a
rock-style guitar pose.
</P>
<P>
   Inter president Massimo Moratti offered nearly $30 million for
Batistuta, hoping to pair him with Ronaldo this season.
Fiorentina's Vittorio Cecchi Gori refused the deal, hoping to
accomplish a unique ``double'' _ the Italian Serie A championship
along with an Academy Award as producer of La Vita e' Bella (Life
is Beautiful).
</P>
<P>
   Moratti was stuck with another former Pallon d'Or winner,
Roberto Baggio. In the last two weeks, Baggio has come off the
bench to score twice against Real Madrid in the Champions League
and to assist Ronaldo's 89th-minute winner against Udinese.

</P>
<P>
   Major League Soccer commissioner Doug Logan apparently offended
executives at ESPN-TV with his remarks following D.C. United's
victory in the InterAmericana Cup competition.
</P>
<P>
   Logan accused ESPN and other mainstream English-language media
of ignoring the accomplishment of D.C. United, which overcame Vasco
da Gama of Brazil, 2-0. He also raised questions about hidden
agendas, hinting at conspiracies.
</P>
<P>
   At least, Logan opened a channel for discussion.
</P>
<P>
   He contended that United's win was a first-rate upset, which it
was. United is in its third year of operation, Vasco da Gama in its
100th year and ranked second in the world. Problems arise when the
nature of the competition has to be explained. The InterAmericana
Cup has little currency in the world, though this result could go
far in promoting it.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN responded to Logan's charges by saying that MLS and other
soccer events are low on their ratings scale. And though ESPN and
ABC are contracted to MLS, the InterAmericana Cup rights were held
by Fox Sports Network.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Logan has the execs' attention, he should bolster his
contentions with some ratings of his own, some concrete figures
derived from FIFA and/or the Soccer Industry Council of America.
</P>
<P>
   As for conspiracies _ yes, other sports leagues have conspired
to restrain the business of soccer. NASL v. NFL in Federal District
Court in New York is the case that allowed cross ownership by
groups such as Anschutz, Hunt, and Kraft in the MLS.
</P>
<P>
   Sports leagues in the US operate as cartels within very strict
limits, and most mainstream coverage also operates within those
limits. Whatever Sports Center reports simply reflects a business
policy as a marionette responds to a puppeteer.
</P>
<P>
   There are some incredible soccer events going on world-wide.
Many of them are actually available on US television, though the
Corinthians-Cruzeiro final in Brazil sadly is not. Before the USA
'94 World Cup and the establishment of the MLS, soccer coverage was
even more uneven and the forum for discussion even more limited
than now.

reporters. Goalkeeper Kasey Keller was second with 238 points and
48 first-place votes, and defender Eddie Pope, the 1997 winner, was
third with 145 points and 21 first-place votes.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 28, played in 15 of the national team's 16 matches,

LUNG CANCER DEATHS AMONG WOMEN RISE DRAMATICALLY IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Lung cancer is killing women in New York at a
rate 40 percent higher than just 20 years ago, according to new
data from the state Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1976 and 1995, the number of women in New York who died
from lung cancer jumped from 19.8 per 100,000 to 32.4, while the
disease's rate of death among men, though still roughly twice that
for women, dropped slightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the biggest and most meaningful cancer trend
that there is over the past 20 years,'' Mark S. Baptiste, the
Health Department's leading epidemiologist, said in a recent
interview.
</P>
<P>
   And the causes behind it are clear: the decades-old boom in the
ranks of women smokers. That trend began in earnest shortly after
World War II, Baptiste said, when legions of women took over jobs
vacated by men _ and also took up what had been a decidedly male
pastime: cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   One of those women was Deborah Cowser, a state worker who lives
in Nassau. Though she now regrets ever getting hooked on tobacco,
Cowser clearly remembers the day in 1964 when she and her best
friend made up their minds to become smokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a conscious decision on my part. I remember my father
was against it, but my mom said, `As long as she can afford it,'''
Cowser, now 50, recalled. ``When I started, everyone around us
smoked.''
</P>
<P>
   One day, with her parents' consent, she plopped down on her bed
with her best friend, Patti, and the two 16-year-olds giddily
peeled open their first pack of Tarrytons.
</P>
<P>
   Cowser still remembers that first, not-so-glorious lungful of
smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``We choked. But that didn't stop us,'' she said. ``It made us
feel big.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even as many men were quitting, Cowser and millions of
other young women like her kept on puffing, unknowingly
contributing, health experts and anti-smoking advocates say, to
what decades later is a full-fledged scourge of deadly lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tobacco is killing more women through cancer,'' Baptiste said.
``It's clearly the smoking epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1955, the number of American men who smoke has steadily
decreased from 52.6 percent to almost half that. But women smokers
defied that steady decline, and their numbers swelled until 1965.
That year, one in three women smoked regularly, according to
federal statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women started smoking en masse as a group a lot later in time
than men did, and we're seeing that reflected now in their
increasing (cancer) incidence,'' Baptiste said. For some people,
smoking leads to lung cancer in a matter of years. For others, the
disease may not appear for decades, if ever.
</P>
<P>
   After peaking in the '60s, smoking rates among women have
declined to about 23 percent, compared to 28 percent of men.
</P>
<P>
   Lung cancer is still the greatest cancer killer of both sexes.
It is one of four types of the disease claiming more lives of women
statewide now compared to 20 years ago, an analysis of the Health
Department data shows. The other growing cancer mortality rates,
though dwarfed by lung cancer, stem from liver and bile duct
cancer, non-Hodgkins lymphoma and multiple myeloma.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in the death rate for each cancer has a working theory
attached to it, Baptiste said.
</P>
<P>
   Increased statewide deaths of women from liver cancer, for
instance, are probably due to the growing number of immigrants from
Asia, where hepatitis and liver ailments are more common, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Higher rates for death from non-Hodgkins lymphoma, which tends
to attack people with weak immune systems, are linked to the
increase in HIV, the immunity-destroying virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Multiple myeloma, though, is more of a mystery to scientists.
Studies have linked the cancer, which also arises because of weak
immune systems, to exposure to certain chemical and occupational
hazards, but its causes remain largely uncertain, Baptiste said.
</P>

<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A new multiyear effort to increase epidemiologists' power to map
cancer rates and identify its causes took shape this year.
</P>
<P>
   Led by the state Health Department, the Cancer Surveillance
Improvement Initiative held its first meeting of epidemiologists,
prevention advocates, environmentalists, doctors and business

   One of the project's first goals is to publish cancer data
current through 1996, which cancer-patient advocates and
environmentalists are eager to see.
</P>
<P>
   The new cancer data were published in ``Cancer Incidence and
Mortality in New York State,'' a three-volume report released by
the Health Department last month. The report, based on the state's
58-year-old cancer registry, offers the most comprehensive
county-by-county data on cancer incidents and mortality rates for
21 types of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Among other notable trends in the report was that for the same
20-year period, the rate of all new cancer cases statewide rose by
15 percent for men and 12 percent for women but remained below the
national averages for both sexes.

`BLUE ROOM' ABOUT SEX, NOT SEXINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT HURWITT  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The sizzle in ``The Blue Room'' isn't all onstage.
Yes, David Hare's new adaptation of Arthur Schnitzler's
turn-of-the-century play ``Reigen'' (more commonly called ``La
Ronde'') is, like the original, all about sex.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, the London import that opened Sunday at the Cort
Theatre features two, mostly scantily clad, briefly naked, actors
engaged in 10 acts of seduction over the course of 95 minutes
(without intermission).
</P>
<P>
   But most of the buzz, in the New York and national press at
least _ as it was in London, where scalpers were reportedly reaping
$1,600 per ticket during its Donmar Warehouse run _ has centered on
the performance of film star Nicole Kidman in her major theatrical
debut. And on the amount of nudity, especially Kidman's, it would
contain, though one would think New Yorkers and Londoners would be
inured to star turns and stage nudity by now.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most of the actual sizzle derives neither from Hare's
script nor the two eminently capable performances, but from a
rather rudimentary special effect.
</P>
<P>
   In Schnitzler's 1900 play _ banned for 20 years in Vienna
because of its sexual explicitness _ a hiatus in the text indicates
each sex act. In Hare and Donmar artistic director Sam Mendes'
version, the stage goes dark, the loud sound of electricity zapping
across a gap reverberates throughout the theater and a projected
title announces the length of this particular copulation (``3
minutes,'' ``45 seconds,'' ``32 minutes'').
</P>
<P>
   It's a clever device, the first few times anyway. But it isn't a
sizzle most people would describe as erotic. Nor is it meant to be.
</P>
<P>
   Schnitzler's use of sex in the original was meant to be as
satiric as shocking. His daisy-chain of infidelity _ one character
from each scene appears in the next with a new partner, that new
person with a new partner in the next, until the chain has run full
circle _ satirized class distinctions and sexual hypocrisy in
turn-of-the-century Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   Hare's adaptation follows suit. The characters have been
modernized, as have the language and attitudes about sex. But the
basic structure remains the same, right down to the class, power
and age differences between the transitory lovers and the dynamics
of each interaction.
</P>
<P>
   The principal difference, as Hare explained in a recent New York
Times essay, is what he called a less cynical, ``maybe more
romantic view of sexual yearning.'' For all the betrayal and
disillusionment, as one character says, ``This way, at least we're
alive.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't add much depth. Hare has become almost a permanent
presence on Broadway of late with one star-bedecked adaptation
(``Ivanov'' with Kevin Kline) or new play (``Skylight'' with
Michael Gambon, ``The Judas Kiss'' with Liam Neeson, ``Amy's View''
with Judi Dench expected in the spring) after another. But ``The
Blue Room'' is Hare in a distinctively minor key.
</P>
<P>
   It's light and bright. It's an entertainingly cautionary look at
what Hare has called ``Every Ghastly Sexual Situation You've Ever
Been In.''
</P>
<P>
   It's inventively staged by Mendes, also represented on Broadway
by his caustic reinterpretation of ``Cabaret.'' And it's performed
with considerable versatility by Kidman and London stage star Iain
Glen (like Kidman, making his Broadway debut), each playing five
distinct and sharply delineated characters in the course of 10
scenes.
</P>
<P>
   As Irene, Kidman is a touchingly naive, vulnerable young
streetwalker falling for Glen's bitter, casually manipulative cab
driver, Fred. As Marie, in a clinging blue minidress, she's a
sharper, mischievous au pair, more of a match for Fred in their
quickie in a back room at a disco, though radically disappointed
and ill-used as she succumbs to the temptation of a fling with her
employers' law student son.
</P>
<P>
   Glen's snottily shy student more than meets his match, to his
great benefit, in Kidman's sophisticated, inquisitive, slightly
sardonic Emma, a politician's wife looking for something safe on
the side. Her sexual reconciliation scene with her husband, Glen's
self-important conservative Charles, is one of the play's more
edgily touching interludes. Charles' seduction of Kidman's ditzy,
drug-numbed teen-age model, Kelly, is among the play's funnier
moments.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, is Kelly's comical fling with Robert, a pompously
disheveled playwright who wields big words as erotic foreplay.
Robert's rural tryst with Kidman's take-charge, theatrically
mercurial actress leavens the comedy with a sophistication that
takes a philosophically poignant turn when she takes on Glen's
world-weary, alcoholic aristocrat, Malcolm. The poignancy carries
over to the final scene, when Malcolm wakes up after a bender with
the still dreamily vulnerable Irene.
</P>
<P>
   Mendes keeps the action flowing briskly on Mark Thompson's
scrupulously crisp set _ a sharply defined box of bright blue
walls, edged in neon strips. Increasingly detailed, high- and
low-fashion unit sets slide onstage to match Hare's escalation to
more sophisticated interactions, as Hugh Vanstone's moody lights,
Paddy Cunneen's pulsating, sax-infused score and Thompson's frumpy,
chic and revealing costumes help set the bemused, sexually aroused
tone.
</P>
<P>
   It is, however, the characters who are aroused, not the audience
_ despite that now-infamous London Daily Telegraph review that
dubbed Kidman's performance ``pure theatrical Viagra.''
</P>
<P>
   Sexuality is almost clinically portrayed in ``The Blue Room.''
As for the nudity, it's minimal, a bit comic and appropriate _ more
so than the gratuitous and more pronounced nude scene that opened
``Judas Kiss,'' and less explicit than other versions of ``La
Ronde.''
</P>
<P>
   Steamy, Hare's ``Blue Room'' is not. A lightly witty look at
affairs that leave us sadder and not necessarily wiser is what it
is, and one that feels as ephemeral as the flings it portrays.
</P>
<P>

Cort Theatre, 138 W. 48th St., New York, through March 7;

   NEW YORK _ If someone has a video of the rally held at the New
York University School of Law this Monday evening, they should give
a copy to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, they denounced the Republican drive for his
impeachment and removal from office _ historians, writers, Nobel
prize winners and one Hollywood actor.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, nobody among the Republicans may pay heed. This was an
intellectuals-for-Clinton kind of deal _ all warmth for the
embattled President and angst for the Republic and its
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   But these were intellectuals of stature, except for the
Hollywood hard man Alec Baldwin. For the 750 souls who crammed in
to listen, it was a night of electrifying eloquence and high
indignation.
</P>
<P>
   The writer E.L. Doctorow, his voice quavering at the
microphones, had this message for those who would overthrow the
President and undo the 1996 presidential election. What they are
preparing to commit, he said, ``was the unseating of a
democratically elected president with all the legitimacy of a coup
d'etat.''
</P>
<P>
   The very soul of America was being threatened, Doctorow
insisted. ``If Mr. Clinton is impeached, or tried or forced to
resign, American puritanism, with its punitive lust and autocratic
and theocratic vision, will be reborn for the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going through this constitutional crisis because this
President lied to the American people. I've been trying to think of
a president in my life who didn't lie to the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Evoking the handling of illegal arm sales to Iran to fund
right-wing contras in Nicaragua by Presidents Reagan and Bush, and
the distortions from Lyndon Johnson during the Vietnam War,
Doctorow offered this: ``Perhaps the problem with President
Clinton's lie is that it lacked grandeur.''
</P>
<P>
   Likening the impeachment to a coup d'etat was a common theme of
the night, Jerry Nadler, a Democrat representative who belongs to
the House Judiciary, said he saw one silver lining in the prospect
of a trial of the President in the Senate next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a trial starts in the Senate we may be able to find out who
started this coup d'etat and who paid for it,'' he thundered to
mighty applause.
</P>
<P>
   For Nobel Prize winner Eli Wiesel it is the battering of Clinton
that must end. To Republicans, he said: ``We appeal to you to put
an end to the relentless humiliation that President Clinton has
been subjected to for three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public humiliation is a sin equal to bloodshed. For the sake
of our collective honor, we plead with you to do what so many of us
wish you had done earlier: censure the President for his
actions.'' &QL;

<P>
   PARIS _ A French parliamentary inquiry Tuesday cleared France of
any direct complicity in the Rwandan genocide of 1994 in which
800,000 people are believed to have been slaughtered.
</P>
<P>
   A nine-month investigation by a parliamentary committee _ the
first of its kind in French history _ criticized the French
authorities for blindly supporting the racist Hutu-led government
and armed forces of Rwanda before the massacres began.
</P>
<P>
   But the report said that France was ``in no way involved,''
either actively or passively, in the mass murder of the minority
Tutsis and moderate Hutus which followed the assassination of
Rwanda's Hutu president in April 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first point that should be recalled is that those who
killed Rwandans were other Rwandans,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The French MP's say that the wider blame for the slaughter _ the
first officially recognized genocide since the Holocaust _ must
rest with the international community as a whole and especially
with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The report says that scores of thousands of lives could have
been saved by the deployment of a United Nations peacekeeping force
but international action was blocked by Washington, which was still
numbed by the failure of its intervention in the conflict in
Somalia the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   The result of the nine-month inquiry will be a disappointment,
but no great surprise, to those both inside and outside France who
have pushed for a full investigation of the French role in Rwanda
before and after the massacres began.
</P>
<P>
   A series of investigative articles in the newspaper Le Figaro
earlier this year claimed that the French authorities were aware _
or ought to have been aware _ that the Hutu-dominated government
and the French-trained Rwandan armed forces were preparing to
slaughter the Tutsi community.
</P>
<P>
   The articles also claimed that Paris continued to supply arms to
the Rwandan government in Kigali after the massacres began.
</P>
<P>
   It was also claimed that the then-French President Francois
Mitterrand operated a clandestine Rwandan policy from the Elysee
Palace in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Although France was publicly committed to peace negotiations
between the two Rwandan ethnic, or social, groups, President
Mitterrand was deeply suspicious of the Tutsi rebel leaders, who
were based in neighboring Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   Since they had lived mostly in exile, speaking English, under
Ugandan and American influence, he believed they posed a threat to
French interests and the survival of the French language in south
central Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The report of the parliamentary inquiry _ actually a study group
rather than a full-scale investigation _ accepted this argument and
condemned the ``institutional dysfunctions'' in the then French
government.
</P>
<P>
   It said France found itself ``trapped by its own (pro-Hutu,
anti-Tutsi) strategy.'' As a result, Paris allowed itself to be
manipulated by the extremists in power in Kigali, instead of
pressuring them to adopt a more pacific and democratic approach.
</P>
<P>
   But the report says that these criticisms do not support the
``unacceptable accusation'' that France was complicit in the
genocide. &QL;

   SAN MARINO, CALIF. _ San Marino is not the sort of community to
sport large welcome signs for visitors. All the arriving motorist
sees is a clutch of warnings: trucks over three tons may not pass;
street parking is prohibited between the hours of 2 a.m. and 5
a.m.; dogs must be kept on a leash at all times.
</P>
<P>
   Along winding residential streets with perfectly trimmed trees
and manicured lawns lurk further discreetly posted signs. ``No
riding bicycles or wheeled toys on sidewalk,'' one says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flying of model airplanes or possession of any motorized racer
is prohibited,'' says another. This is at the entrance to the main
public recreation area, Lacy Park.
</P>
<P>
   But these visible prohibitions are only the beginning of the
story. According to city rules, home owners may not leave cars on
their driveways for more than 48 hours without risking a fine.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone wishing to trim a tree has to seek official permission,
and failure to abide by the strict regulations can result in
mandatory enrollment in a community-sponsored tree-pruning class.
</P>
<P>
   Forgetting to mow the lawn can result in a citation at the local
courthouse and a fine. Ditto for those who let their lawn
sprinklers dribble on to the pavement.
</P>
<P>
   Professional gardeners are encouraged, but only after they have
been vetted and issued with an identification tag that must be
carried on the job at all times.
</P>
<P>
   Every house has to have a garage with room for at least two
cars. Using a garage for other purposes _ for storage, or for
office space _ is strictly forbidden. In fact, business activities
of all kinds are banned in private homes.
</P>
<P>
   As is the construction of more than one kitchen. More than one
kitchen might encourage tenants, and tenants are strictly forbidden
under an ordinance proclaiming that all houses in San Marino must
be single-family homes.
</P>
<P>
   In laid back, happy-go-lucky, anything-goes-California, San
Marino is an anomaly. It is probably the most regulated local
community in America, if not the world.
</P>
<P>
   What other city would insist on bicycle licenses, or pet
restrictions limiting households to ``a maximum of three dogs or
four cats over the age of six weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People here like rules and orderliness,'' explained Tom
Santley, executive director of the San Marino Chamber of Commerce.
``It all stems from the desires of the residents themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, this is a conservative part of the world, a
suburb of old, established money just south of Pasadena, about 10
miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The police rarely show their faces on the streets because they
do not need to. If a resident commits an infraction, they soon know
it because the neighbors instantly call up to complain.
</P>
<P>
   San Marino was originally the retreat of Henry Huntington, a man
who built his fortune from trams and railroads at the turn of the
century and established a famous library and botanical garden here
beneath the San Gabriel mountains that still attract tens of
thousands of visitors each year.
</P>
<P>
   He deliberately named San Marino after the secluded principality
in central Italy, the last independent city-state in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Originally the rules in San Marino were stricter still _ so
concerned were Huntington and his friends to deter unsightly crowds
that they inadvertently banned churches along with all other public
gathering places (an oversight corrected in 1940).
</P>
<P>
   Although alcohol was always available for consumption at home,
it was not authorized in restaurants until last year.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, San Marino's core population of white
Protestants from the downtown elite has given way to an influx of
new money including, most strikingly, prosperous families of Asian
origin. But attitudes have remained the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still like to think of ourselves as the landed gentry,''
said Santley.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say there isn't room for friction. Warren
Pedersen, a retired engineering geologist sweeping leaves off his
front lawn, explained how his gentlemanly offer to pay for his
neighbor's tall eucalyptus trees to be trimmed (to avert possible
storm damage to his roof) nearly ended in tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police said my neighbor had violated a rule protecting
branches of more than four inches in diameter and threatened to
take her to court. I had to step in to explain what had happened,''
Pedersen explained. ``People take trees pretty seriously around
here.''
</P>
<P>
   To help new residents through the labyrinth of rules and
regulations, the city has produced a guidebook on the main points.
It's a hefty volume that explains how front yards may only be 35
percent cemented over, how political stickers and neon signs are
banned, and how vehicles may not be advertised for sale anywhere
within the city limits.
</P>
<P>
   As a memory aid, there is even a pictorial summary. The summary
is entitled: ``Do's and don'ts.'' And it is subtitled: ``Mostly
don'ts.'' &QL;

SEARCH CONTINUES FOR MISSING REPORTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MacCORMACK  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The search for a missing journalist in a mountainous region of
western Mexico continued Tuesday, with the Mexican government
promising helicopters to reinforce family members and others
looking for the man.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the Mexican Attorney General's Office said
they would send helicopters to the remote Sierra Madre Occidental
range to search for Philip True, the Mexico City-based
correspondent for the San Antonio Express-News.
</P>
<P>
   True did not return to Mexico City on Dec. 9 as scheduled and
his wife said she last heard from him on Nov. 29, when he set off
on the solo hike.
</P>
<P>
   State police in the region already are searching for True, and a
party of more than a dozen Huichol Indians joined the search in the
deep canyons of the Sierra Madre.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very grateful for the work the Mexican government and the
U.S. Embassy have done. They have worked for 72 hours,'' said Marta
True, wife of the 50-year-old journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rivard, executive editor of the San Antonio newspaper,
met with representatives of the U.S. Embassy and the staff of
Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo late Monday at True's apartment
in Mexico City. After that meeting, the Mexican attorney general's
office agreed to assist in the search.
</P>
<P>
   True set out Nov. 29 on a hiking trip in the Sierra Madre
Occidental back country. He had hoped to photograph and write about
the Huichol Indians who are native to the states of Jalisco and
Nayarit.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Simon, of the Washington-based Committee to Protect
Journalists, said Monday he appealed to both Zedillo's office and
the State Department to enlist military help in finding the missing
reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the expertise of the Mexican military in
search-and-rescue missions, their familiarity with this rugged
terrain, and the sophisticated equipment available to them, they
stand the best chance of locating True and bringing him to
safety,'' Simon wrote to Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   An experienced hiker of the Mexican back-country himself, Simon
said the region True planned to explore was not necessarily the
most dangerous in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is any significant drug trafficking there
and that is probably the biggest risk in hiking in rural Mexico,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the most likely scenario is that he is either lost or
immobilized by a twisted ankle. He could be sitting in some
peasant's hut and he couldn't even explain to them what a telephone
is, since they don't speak Spanish,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may have to sit there until someone comes. That's what I am
hoping,'' Simon said.

 c.1998 Foreign Affairs Magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Anyone personally appointed by the president of the United
States to a position of high trust and responsibility in foreign
and defense policy swears to uphold the Constitution and laws of
the United States, has the FBI confirm his or her patriotism, and
accepts a good-faith obligation as a public servant to serve the
interests of the American people.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not all.
</P>
<P>
   Senior appointments entail an obligation of loyalty to the
president who appointed you. That is not the same as unlimited
allegiance, much less subservient obedience or blind faith. It does
not exclude other obligations to Congress, the taxpayers or one's
department. But it is an obligation, nevertheless _ one that, once
accepted, should not be lightly abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   This charge is more than a legal obligation arising out of an
employer-employee relationship. It is even more than loyalty to an
impersonal administration or ``team,'' though that may well be part
of it. Conversely, it is more than a matter of friendship, for it
applies equally to those who have a close relationship with the
president and those who do not.
</P>
<P>
   It is essentially a moral commitment to that president as
president, to respect his leadership, reciprocate his confidence
and trust, and faithfully support his final decisions, even _ or
especially _ when they are under attack.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about the meaning and limitations of loyalty to the
president were raised anew by the recent legal and political
imbroglio in Washington arising out of President Clinton's sexual
misconduct. In a futile effort at concealment, he lied not only
under oath and to the public but also to his cabinet and White
House staff.
</P>
<P>
   His secretary of state, secretary of the treasury and other top
aides were in effect dispatched to repeat his denials to the news
media, the grand jury investigating his activities, and
representatives of foreign governments. Several months later, when
the truth was out, their pain was palpable.
</P>
<P>
   Yet not one appointee resigned. Reportedly, only one mildly
rebuked the president. Several told others of their sense of
betrayal, sorrow, shame or anger over their forced grand jury
appearances _ but almost never spoke publicly to the press.
</P>
<P>
   Some appointees were deemed ``gullible'' for believing him,
``gutless'' for not leaving him, or ``foolishly loyal'' for
remaining silent. Yet former Clinton appointees who spoke
negatively to the press about his actions were labeled ``ungrateful
and disloyal.''
</P>
<P>
   The resulting commentaries on loyalty to the president can be
divided into two schools. One maintains that loyalty in general is
an antiquated trait that has largely fallen into disuse. Evidence
of this proposition abounds.
</P>
<P>
   In the more cynical, materialistic 1980s and 1990s, few pay
attention to such lofty concepts as honor, steadfastness and
fidelity. A more mobile workforce has become accustomed to slipping
the bonds of devotion to former mentors, employers and friends and
finds time only for acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   Children no longer grow up unshakable fans of ``hometown''
sports teams because they seldom have a ``hometown,'' and the star
players _ and even the franchises themselves _ leave to pursue
greater riches elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Memoirs betraying the secrets of former confidants, spouses or
lovers have been highly successful; unsurprisingly, books by recent
administration officials have not all been discreet, much less
supportive.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, loyalty to the chief was both taught and enforced by
big-city political organizations built on unswerving fealty to the
local leader and the patronage, promotions and perquisites that
came with it. Among federal employees in the pre-civil service
days, William Howard Taft once wrote, ``even the humblest charwoman
... felt a throb of deep personal interest in the political health
of the President.''
</P>
<P>
   But today's political organizations are too weak to provide any
meaningful reward or inspiration for the faithful, much less any
discipline for those who are not.
</P>
<P>
   The other current school of media commentary finds the principle
of loyalty to the president not so much forgotten and underutilized
as all too present and overrated. Loyalty is derided as a
Mafia-like code of silence that prevents current and former
advisers from criticizing unconscionable presidential actions _ an
instrument of ``political serfdom'' that stifles disagreement
within an administration and keeps appointees from either resigning
in protest or speaking out in public.
</P>
<P>
   Kai Bird's recent book on the Bundy brothers and Vietnam
criticizes them and other ``wise men ... so steeped in the
Establishment's culture of discretion that values loyalty over
dissent'' that they could not break with President Johnson on
Vietnam or publicly disagree with him even after leaving office.
``In short,'' Bird writes, ``the Establishment had a problem
speaking truth to power.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert S. McNamara was similarly accused of ``misguided
loyalty'' for withholding his doubts about the winnability and
morality of the Vietnam War even after he left the Department of
Defense for the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   But passion over either the Clinton follies or Vietnam should
not blind us to the long-term value of loyalty. Loyalty is
indispensable to an organized society and to orderly and effective
governance. No American president can provide consistent direction
in foreign affairs if he cannot depend upon those who accept his
trust to also accept his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   No president should need to spell out this obligation to his new
appointees; he has every right and reason to assume it is part of
their instinctive morality and institutional duty. Presidential
aides expect and deserve it from one another to deter leaks,
backbiting and factionalism.
</P>
<P>
   The very concept of ``public service'' requires it from all who
put their personal interests aside to serve. The framers of the
Constitution, having rejected the notion of an executive council
directing the president, assumed his subordinates would support
him.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a difference between a loyal agent and a fanatical
zealot _ or a servile puppet. All obligations of principle have
practical conditions and limitations, and that includes the
principle of loyalty to the president. As a new appointee, you have
a duty to support, protect and defend his interests, success and
agenda even on those occasions when they are inconsistent with your
interests, success and agenda.
</P>
<P>
   But that does not require you to ``fall on your sword,'' go to
prison, or endanger your life or that of others. You are not
expected to forswear commitments to country and conscience, to
family and faith. Your obligation to keep his secrets is not an
obligation to tell lies, especially under oath. Your commitment to
his every cause does not oblige you to conspire in any crime.
</P>
<P>
   If loyalty does not require zealotry, neither does it require
sycophancy. Neither the president nor the presidency is well served
by a toady intimidated by the atmosphere of ``fear and fawning''
surrounding the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   An adviser must be more than an uncritical admirer. Eagerness to
concur must not repress the qualities of mind and character that
caused you to be appointed in the first place. Your duty is not to
please the president but to help him _ bringing him your best
judgment even when it is harsh, the whole truth even when it hurts,
and all the choices even when they are hard.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, loyalty to the president, if it is to endure, must be
reciprocal. A president under fire who blames his appointees for
his failures or shames them in front of their peers is far more
likely to find his aides undercutting him with unattributed
comments to reporters and his former appointees distancing
themselves from his troubles than a president who has consistently
shown ``loyalty down'' by defending his aides in public, reassuring
them in private and protecting them against attacks from Congress
or the press.
</P>
<P>
   No president is required to tell any of his appointees
everything, but he cannot long retain their trust if he tells them
lies. No president is required to be right every time, but he has
no right to risk the very principles that drew his subordinates to
him. No president is required to accept any aide's advice on any
particular issue, but he risks resignation or revolt if he rejects
that advice without ample explanation of his reasons and careful
consideration of that adviser's core values.
</P>
<P>
   One's core values will ultimately test whether one's loyalty to
the president is more than kind words. The obligation to accept his
final decisions is not limited to those about which you do not care
or with which you do not disagree. Living with deep-seated
disagreement and disappointment is an inevitable part of the job.
</P>
<P>
   Despite checks and balances, the American system entrusts
enormous decision- making authority to the presidency. That grant
of power is justified and conditioned on one fundamental fact: Its
occupant is elected by all the people.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps on some critical issue, an aide is certain that the
president was wrong and the aide right. But, as the old question
goes: Who elected you? The president alone bears the final
responsibility, and he receives information, advice, options and
political considerations of which you may be unaware.
</P>
<P>
   Loyally accepting a presidential decision with which you
profoundly disagree does not require a surrender of your rights or
values. Within the limits of loyalty, you can continue to voice
your doubts and dissents privately to the president, ``speaking
truth to power'' as George Ball did on Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   You can ask that you not be assigned to defend that which you
consider indefensible _ a request that serves the president's own
interest, for you may be unable to defend it credibly and
effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can swallow your disapproval, confide your disquietude
only to your diary and distant memoirs (not in leaks to the press
or in disgruntled administration cabals), and stay at your post,
remaining ever hopeful that this too will pass, that on most
important issues within your jurisdiction the president has earned
your support, and that your continuing to prod within his circle
will do more to move him in the right direction than any public
protest you might make.
</P>
<P>
   Clark M. Clifford, by carrying on as secretary of defense even
as his doubts grew about Vietnam, helped steer President Johnson
toward a negotiated exit. That is not a coward's rationale. Staying
often takes more courage than leaving.
</P>
<P>
   If, however, the president's decision involves so overriding a
principle that you can no longer in good conscience continue to
believe in his leadership, much less implement that particular
decision, then it is neither dishonorable nor disloyal to quietly
submit your resignation _ not to continually threaten it, but to
simply do it.
</P>
<P>
   Loyalty may induce you to postpone the effective date until
after that particular crisis or the next election. It may induce
you not to make public your discomfort for months, for years or
forever, depending on the urgency of the issue and the prospects of
changing the president's course. It cannot and should not compel
you to stay when your heart is no longer in your job.
</P>
<P>
   But abandoning a president of the United States in crisis is not
a step one takes lightly. The president's troubles, even if
self-inflicted, are the nation's troubles. It is a time not to jump
ship but to help save it.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer does not abandon a long-term client for ignoring his
advice, withholding facts from him or otherwise falling short of
his standards.
</P>
<P>
   If you leave a president's side, you increase the weight of
those who advised him differently than you, and you leave
shorthanded those in the administration who share your convictions.
</P>
<P>
   In appointing you, the president is promising that he will hear
your advice, not that he will always heed it. He is promising you a
post full of challenge, not a post free from disappointment. He is
expecting not only your wisdom but also your loyalty. There is no
way of knowing at what point, on what issue, that loyalty will be
severely tested.
</P>
<P>
   You may then be required to balance the principle of loyalty
against some other principle you hold dear, the need to recognize
the president's democratic authority against your individual
convictions, his right to your support against your right to speak
out, your prospects for helping to alter his course if you stay
inside against your prospects for influencing that course if you
move outside.
</P>
<P>
   You will receive conflicting advice from concerned friends,
interested groups, and self-righteous columnists. If you cannot
handle that pressure, better reconsider accepting the appointment.

<P>
   Anyone personally appointed by the president of the United
States to a position of high trust and responsibility in foreign
and defense policy swears to uphold the Constitution and laws of
the United States, has the FBI confirm his or her patriotism, and
accepts a good-faith obligation as a public servant to serve the
interests of the American people.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not all.
</P>
<P>
   Senior appointments entail an obligation of loyalty to the
president who appointed you. That is not the same as unlimited
allegiance, much less subservient obedience or blind faith. It does
not exclude other obligations to Congress, the taxpayers or one's
department. But it is an obligation, nevertheless _ one that, once
accepted, should not be lightly abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   This charge is more than a legal obligation arising out of an
employer-employee relationship. It is even more than loyalty to an
impersonal administration or ``team,'' though that may well be part
of it. Conversely, it is more than a matter of friendship, for it
applies equally to those who have a close relationship with the
president and those who do not.
</P>
<P>
   It is essentially a moral commitment to that president as
president, to respect his leadership, reciprocate his confidence
and trust, and faithfully support his final decisions, even _ or
especially _ when they are under attack.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about the meaning and limitations of loyalty to the
president were raised anew by the recent legal and political
imbroglio in Washington arising out of President Clinton's sexual
misconduct. In a futile effort at concealment, he lied not only
under oath and to the public but also to his cabinet and White
House staff.
</P>
<P>
   His secretary of state, secretary of the treasury and other top
aides were in effect dispatched to repeat his denials to the news
media, the grand jury investigating his activities, and
representatives of foreign governments. Several months later, when
the truth was out, their pain was palpable.
</P>
<P>
   Yet not one appointee resigned. Reportedly, only one mildly
rebuked the president. Several told others of their sense of
betrayal, sorrow, shame or anger over their forced grand jury
appearances _ but almost never spoke publicly to the press.
</P>
<P>
   Some appointees were deemed ``gullible'' for believing him,
``gutless'' for not leaving him, or ``foolishly loyal'' for
remaining silent. Yet former Clinton appointees who spoke
negatively to the press about his actions were labeled ``ungrateful
and disloyal.''
</P>
<P>
   The resulting commentaries on loyalty to the president can be
divided into two schools. One maintains that loyalty in general is
an antiquated trait that has largely fallen into disuse. Evidence
of this proposition abounds.
</P>
<P>
   In the more cynical, materialistic 1980s and 1990s, few pay
attention to such lofty concepts as honor, steadfastness and
fidelity. A more mobile workforce has become accustomed to slipping
the bonds of devotion to former mentors, employers and friends and
finds time only for acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   Children no longer grow up unshakable fans of ``hometown''
sports teams because they seldom have a ``hometown,'' and the star
players _ and even the franchises themselves _ leave to pursue
greater riches elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Memoirs betraying the secrets of former confidants, spouses or
lovers have been highly successful; unsurprisingly, books by recent
administration officials have not all been discreet, much less
supportive.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, loyalty to the chief was both taught and enforced by
big-city political organizations built on unswerving fealty to the
local leader and the patronage, promotions and perquisites that
came with it. Among federal employees in the pre-civil service
days, William Howard Taft once wrote, ``even the humblest charwoman
... felt a throb of deep personal interest in the political health
of the President.''
</P>
<P>
   But today's political organizations are too weak to provide any
meaningful reward or inspiration for the faithful, much less any
discipline for those who are not.
</P>
<P>
   The other current school of media commentary finds the principle
of loyalty to the president not so much forgotten and underutilized
as all too present and overrated. Loyalty is derided as a
Mafia-like code of silence that prevents current and former
advisers from criticizing unconscionable presidential actions _ an
instrument of ``political serfdom'' that stifles disagreement
within an administration and keeps appointees from either resigning
in protest or speaking out in public.
</P>
<P>
   Kai Bird's recent book on the Bundy brothers and Vietnam
criticizes them and other ``wise men ... so steeped in the
Establishment's culture of discretion that values loyalty over
dissent'' that they could not break with President Johnson on
Vietnam or publicly disagree with him even after leaving office.
``In short,'' Bird writes, ``the Establishment had a problem
speaking truth to power.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert S. McNamara was similarly accused of ``misguided
loyalty'' for withholding his doubts about the winnability and
morality of the Vietnam War even after he left the Department of
Defense for the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   But passion over either the Clinton follies or Vietnam should
not blind us to the long-term value of loyalty. Loyalty is
indispensable to an organized society and to orderly and effective
governance. No American president can provide consistent direction
in foreign affairs if he cannot depend upon those who accept his
trust to also accept his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   No president should need to spell out this obligation to his new
appointees; he has every right and reason to assume it is part of
their instinctive morality and institutional duty. Presidential
aides expect and deserve it from one another to deter leaks,
backbiting and factionalism.
</P>
<P>
   The very concept of ``public service'' requires it from all who
put their personal interests aside to serve. The framers of the
Constitution, having rejected the notion of an executive council
directing the president, assumed his subordinates would support
him.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a difference between a loyal agent and a fanatical
zealot _ or a servile puppet. All obligations of principle have
practical conditions and limitations, and that includes the
principle of loyalty to the president. As a new appointee, you have
a duty to support, protect and defend his interests, success and
agenda even on those occasions when they are inconsistent with your
interests, success and agenda.
</P>
<P>
   But that does not require you to ``fall on your sword,'' go to
prison, or endanger your life or that of others. You are not
expected to forswear commitments to country and conscience, to
family and faith. Your obligation to keep his secrets is not an
obligation to tell lies, especially under oath. Your commitment to
his every cause does not oblige you to conspire in any crime.
</P>
<P>
   If loyalty does not require zealotry, neither does it require
sycophancy. Neither the president nor the presidency is well served
by a toady intimidated by the atmosphere of ``fear and fawning''
surrounding the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   An adviser must be more than an uncritical admirer. Eagerness to
concur must not repress the qualities of mind and character that
caused you to be appointed in the first place. Your duty is not to
please the president but to help him _ bringing him your best
judgment even when it is harsh, the whole truth even when it hurts,
and all the choices even when they are hard.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, loyalty to the president, if it is to endure, must be
reciprocal. A president under fire who blames his appointees for
his failures or shames them in front of their peers is far more
likely to find his aides undercutting him with unattributed
comments to reporters and his former appointees distancing
themselves from his troubles than a president who has consistently
shown ``loyalty down'' by defending his aides in public, reassuring
them in private and protecting them against attacks from Congress
or the press.
</P>
<P>
   No president is required to tell any of his appointees
everything, but he cannot long retain their trust if he tells them
lies. No president is required to be right every time, but he has
no right to risk the very principles that drew his subordinates to
him. No president is required to accept any aide's advice on any
particular issue, but he risks resignation or revolt if he rejects
that advice without ample explanation of his reasons and careful
consideration of that adviser's core values.
</P>
<P>
   One's core values will ultimately test whether one's loyalty to
the president is more than kind words. The obligation to accept his
final decisions is not limited to those about which you do not care
or with which you do not disagree. Living with deep-seated
disagreement and disappointment is an inevitable part of the job.
</P>
<P>
   Despite checks and balances, the American system entrusts
enormous decision- making authority to the presidency. That grant
of power is justified and conditioned on one fundamental fact: Its
occupant is elected by all the people.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps on some critical issue, an aide is certain that the
president was wrong and the aide right. But, as the old question
goes: Who elected you? The president alone bears the final
responsibility, and he receives information, advice, options and
political considerations of which you may be unaware.
</P>
<P>
   Loyally accepting a presidential decision with which you
profoundly disagree does not require a surrender of your rights or
values. Within the limits of loyalty, you can continue to voice
your doubts and dissents privately to the president, ``speaking
truth to power'' as George Ball did on Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   You can ask that you not be assigned to defend that which you
consider indefensible _ a request that serves the president's own
interest, for you may be unable to defend it credibly and
effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can swallow your disapproval, confide your disquietude
only to your diary and distant memoirs (not in leaks to the press
or in disgruntled administration cabals), and stay at your post,
remaining ever hopeful that this too will pass, that on most
important issues within your jurisdiction the president has earned
your support, and that your continuing to prod within his circle
will do more to move him in the right direction than any public
protest you might make.
</P>
<P>
   Clark M. Clifford, by carrying on as secretary of defense even
as his doubts grew about Vietnam, helped steer President Johnson
toward a negotiated exit. That is not a coward's rationale. Staying
often takes more courage than leaving.
</P>
<P>
   If, however, the president's decision involves so overriding a
principle that you can no longer in good conscience continue to
believe in his leadership, much less implement that particular
decision, then it is neither dishonorable nor disloyal to quietly
submit your resignation _ not to continually threaten it, but to
simply do it.
</P>
<P>
   Loyalty may induce you to postpone the effective date until
after that particular crisis or the next election. It may induce
you not to make public your discomfort for months, for years or
forever, depending on the urgency of the issue and the prospects of
changing the president's course. It cannot and should not compel
you to stay when your heart is no longer in your job.
</P>
<P>
   But abandoning a president of the United States in crisis is not
a step one takes lightly. The president's troubles, even if
self-inflicted, are the nation's troubles. It is a time not to jump
ship but to help save it.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer does not abandon a long-term client for ignoring his
advice, withholding facts from him or otherwise falling short of
his standards.
</P>
<P>
   If you leave a president's side, you increase the weight of
those who advised him differently than you, and you leave
shorthanded those in the administration who share your convictions.
</P>
<P>
   In appointing you, the president is promising that he will hear
your advice, not that he will always heed it. He is promising you a
post full of challenge, not a post free from disappointment. He is
expecting not only your wisdom but also your loyalty. There is no
way of knowing at what point, on what issue, that loyalty will be
severely tested.
</P>
<P>
   You may then be required to balance the principle of loyalty
against some other principle you hold dear, the need to recognize
the president's democratic authority against your individual
convictions, his right to your support against your right to speak
out, your prospects for helping to alter his course if you stay
inside against your prospects for influencing that course if you
move outside.
</P>
<P>
   You will receive conflicting advice from concerned friends,
interested groups, and self-righteous columnists. If you cannot
handle that pressure, better reconsider accepting the appointment.

JAZZY NEW BROADWAY SHOWS ARE A DELIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT HURWITT  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Taken together, two of the more delightful new shows
on Broadway add up to something of a chronicle of the decline of
jazz as the dominant popular musical form from the big band era
through bebop.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Town,'' the invigoratingly nostalgic George C. Wolfe
revival of Leonard Bernstein's famed first musical, at the Gershwin
Theatre, swings with the infectious energy of jazz in the early
'40s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Side Man,'' Warren Leight's poignant drama at the Golden
Theatre, traces the private lives of increasingly marginalized jazz
players in the 1960s and '70s with the mournful notes of a
prolonged trumpet solo.
</P>
<P>
   Each play, in its own way, is an ode to a period fading into the
past, and each uses music to make its case. Though ``Side Man'' is
one of five non-musicals on Broadway today, Leight's memory play of
a musician's dysfunctional family reaches its epiphany in a long
passage in which four horn players simply listen to a trumpet solo.
In ``On the Town,'' the whole crazy saga of three sailors' 24-hour
shore leave in New York is defined by Bernstein's brilliant score.
</P>
<P>
   Classic or no, Wolfe's Joseph Papp Public Theater/New York
Shakespeare Festival revival of Bernstein's musical has been a
pretty tough sell from the beginning, even in an age when revivals
have been one of Broadway's dominant forms. Wolfe staged it at the
NYSF's outdoor theater in Central Park in the summer of 1997 to
fairly lukewarm reviews _ tepid enough to cause the Public's
potential commercial producing partners to take a pass.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the negative reaction was based on the performances. But
much more focused on the new choreography by Eliot Feld. ``On the
Town,'' after all, had not only been Bernstein's Broadway debut but
also Jerome Robbins' _ the concept for the show spun off from
Bernstein and Robbins' ballet ``Fancy Free'' _ as well as that of
book and lyrics writers Betty Comden and Adolph Green.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe and the Public decided to make the move to Broadway alone,
taking on Los Angeles choreographer Keith Young and replacing and
retaining a few key performers. The result opened at the Gershwin
in late November to still mixed but generally more positive
reviews.
</P>
<P>
   It deserves it. Wolfe's production could stand some tightening,
better executed slapstick and other improvements. It's not quite
the knockout it could be. But it's a genuine delight for most of
its 2 1/2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Side Man'' hasn't suffered mixed reviews. It's received raves
from its Off Broadway Weissberger Theater Group production last
spring to its summer run at the Roundabout Theatre, staged by
Michael Mayer, to that production's commercial transfer to the
Golden in October, co-produced by the Weissberger (the show
originated at New York Stage &AMP; Film Company two years ago). But its
position is precarious nonetheless. New American plays on Broadway
are rarer than gigs for jazz trumpeters.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is ``Side Man'' an explosive drama or flashy star vehicle,
though it does feature Christian Slater as the memory play's
narrator, trying to come to terms with his childhood as the son of
a distant, disconnected trumpet player and an explosive, half-mad,
alcoholic mother. But Slater's role isn't the lead in ``Side Man.''
No role is. Part of the quiet beauty of Warren Leight's
semi-autobiographical reverie on jazz is the degree to which its
structure mirrors its subject.
</P>
<P>
   The play is the dramatic equivalent of an extended jazz ballad,
its narrative delivered in almost free-form, chronologically
fractured riffs and solos for each of the principals. Slater's
quietly troubled, eloquently unassuming Clifford virtually
disappears for long stretches of the two-hour play as his parents'
lives and their friends' stories take over.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Wood, who originated the role, plays Clifford's
ever-inattentive father as a slate so blank that you're drawn ever
deeper into trying to fathom what makes him tick. Wendy Makkena, of
the Roundabout cast (leaving Jan. 8, to be replaced by the original
mother, Edie Falco), is astonishing in the play's most demanding
role, riding a roller coaster of giddy, wary, disillusioned,
maddened and vituperative emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Lyle Taylor, eager Michael Mastro and strung-out Kevin
Geer, and Angelica Torn as the oft-married, supportive Patsy,
contribute sharply defined performances.
</P>
<P>
   Reveries, clashing dissonances and up-tempo riffs flow smoothly
in Mayer's sensitive staging, illuminated by brilliant snatches of
jazz classics _ Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, Miles Davis, with
Benny Golson's ``I Remember Clifford'' (performed by Lee Morgan) as
a recurrent theme. In the end, it's Clifford Brown who holds the
key to the enigma of the absent father and the hidden passion that
keeps him and his cronies pursuing their art as the gigs become
fewer and more humiliating.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Wood, as he listens with exhilarating rapture to a tape
of Brown's tour de force solo on Dizzy Gillespie's ``A Night in
Tunisia,'' the ineffable lure of jazz becomes something palpable,
immediate and indispensable.

   BKN-NBA-RACE (New York) _ The negotiations have often been
heated, with both sides pointing fingers and hurling profanity.
Egos have been bruised, and enormous amounts of money and pride
have been sacrificed. But while it sounds like any other labor war
in America, one dynamic separates the National Basketball
Association from other disputes _ the issue of race. The players
union is 85 percent black and has begun to question whether it is
being treated with respect by an ownership that is 100 percent
white. Any number of players have already concluded they are not
being taken seriously and seem angry enough to sacrifice a season
to prove a point. By Selena Roberts and Mike Wise.

   FBN-PATRIOTS-STADIUM (Hartford, Conn.) _ Misgivings remain, and
the deal is still the most generous ever offered to the owner of a

to $1.5 billion over the next 30 years to support the New England

CAUTIOUSLY, TRAVELERS SHOP ON THE INTERNET  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 20) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ADAM BRYANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Booking travel over the Internet has long been touted as a
cottage industry with huge potential, with projections that sales
will grow from $827 million last year to $8.9 billion by 2002. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But that can only happen if more consumers overcome concerns
about security while making credit card purchases. And those
concerns are significant: A recent survey by Phocuswright, a
research and consulting company specializing in online travel,
found that among 500 people who have traveled by air in the past
year and visited a Web site in the past month, 80 percent have
looked at Internet travel sites and 58 percent have checked fares.
But only 18 percent have used the Internet to book travel online. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About 75 percent of nonbuyers of online travel say they are
unlikely to change their ways soon. The main reason for their
reluctance? Credit card security. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To airlines and online travel companies, such worries are
unfounded. These companies say that credit card transactions over
the Internet are safer than handing a credit card to a waiter at a
restaurant. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, perception is reality in such matters. ``Most
people in the industry think that credit card security is an old
issue,'' said Terrell Jones, chief information officer for the
Sabre Group, which operates Travelocity, a popular site
(www.travelocity. com). ``But in the minds of consumers, it is very
much an issue.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Airlines and travel reservation companies are scrambling to
address problems of perception. Their incentive to do so is clear:
Airlines can pocket commissions they would otherwise pay to travel
agents, and it is cheaper to have computers, instead of people,
make reservations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The issue is not limited to the travel industry. Last month the
Clinton administration announced a number of steps to promote
electronic commerce globally and provide adequate consumer
protection. Vice President Gore said that consumers made 27 million
purchases every day on the Internet, and that electronic commerce
was expected to grow to $300 billion annually in a few years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to buy, say, a sweater over the Internet. But
air travel is often an expensive purchase, adding to the
trepidation. Booking a ticket can also be complicated, and fares
are often nonrefundable. Many people would also rather deal with a
person, if only to get reassurance that the fare they are buying is
the lowest available at the time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One recent development introduced by Travelocity, and quickly
adopted by other travel sites, is a guarantee that if a credit card
number is stolen, the airline or reservation company will pick up
the $50 deductible that consumers are usually required to pay
credit card companies for purchases made with their stolen cards. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't paid a dime, and we don't expect that we'll have
to,'' Jones said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To bolster consumer confidence, some sites post the logo
BBBOnline, to signify that the company that administers the Web
site meets standards set by the Better Business Bureau. Many also
said they buy the latest encryption, or data-scrambling, software
as soon as it becomes available. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   United Airlines said that to insure security of Internet
transactions, it verifies every credit card purchase to make sure
the card has not been reported stolen or lost. If customers buy
electronic tickets, the airline requires them to show photo
identification at the gate as well as a credit card to make sure
signatures match. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are signs that credit card security is becoming less
bothersome. United Airlines, for example, found in a recent
customer survey that sensitivity to security issues had dropped
from the first to the third most important concern behind ``ease of
use'' and ``functionality.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other surveys also show rapid growth in use of Internet travel
sites. The Travel Industry Association said recently that among
Internet users 48 percent of travelers and 52 percent of frequent
travelers use their computers for travel plans or reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures represent a sharp jump from its 1997 survey, when
28 percent of travelers and 31 percent of frequent travelers used
the Internet. It also found that 92 percent of the people it
surveyed were either satisfied or extremely satisfied with their
use of the Internet for travel plans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some common uses of travel Web sites, even for people who do not
book online, include checking fares to reassure themselves that
prices quoted by a travel agent are indeed the lowest available.
And many Internet sites offer virtual tours of hotels or resorts. &QL;

SOME ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ON TRAVEL  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 20) 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Q. I'm going to Hawaii, the Big Island, for my honeymoon this
winter. Are there tours of the volcanoes, especially on horseback?
_ Juliette D. Fisher, Riverside, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. The Big Island's biggest attraction is certainly Hawaii
Volcanoes National Park, which extends from the sea to the summit
of Mauna Loa, the world's most massive volcano. On the eastern
flank is the 4,000-foot Kilauea, the most active volcano in the
world; Crater Rim Drive runs 11 miles around Kilauea Caldera, the
park's fiery centerpiece.
</P>
<P>
   The road makes it easy to tour the park by car or bike, but
there are no bike rentals. Hilo Bike Hub, near the airport, rents
mountain bikes for $25 to $35 a day, $100 to $140 a week; (808)
961-4452, fax (808) 934-9097.
</P>
<P>
   The park also has many easy walks and day hikes, and gives
permits for overnight treks. It is open 24 hours a day all year;
the Kilauea Visitor Center is open 7:45 a.m. to 5 p.m. An admission
ticket, good for a week, is $10 a car or $5 for a biker or hiker.
</P>
<P>
   Information: Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, Post Office Box 52,
Hawaii National Park, Hawaii 96718; (808) 985-6000, fax (808)
967-8186 or www.nps.gov/havo. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are many standard bus tours, but only one licensed
horseback tour, according to the park superintendent's office.
Hauoli Trails, run by Uilani and Nathan Domingo, takes no more than
five riders on daily outings, using Arabians, thoroughbreds and
quarterhorses. They last two and a half ($120) or four and a half
hours ($180), and are open to all levels of riders.
</P>
<P>
   Riding is mainly in the rain forest, but there are opportunities
for cantering and a hike through Thurston Lava Tube, a tunnel of
hardened lava, Mrs. Domingo said.
</P>
<P>
   Tour guides discuss the geology, history and culture of the
area. Tours leave daily at 9 a.m. from Volcano Village, just
outside the park. Hauoli Trails, Post Office Box 630, Volcano,
Hawaii 96785, (888) 985-8100, fax (808) 985-7263;
www.gtesupersite.com/volcanohorse.
</P>
<P>
   The horses don't get close to flowing lava, but at least one
hiking tour does. Arnott's Lodge and Hiking Adventures, 98 Apapane
Road, Hilo, Hawaii 06720, offers several tours, including an
eight-hour outing that visits Kilauea Caldera by van before an
evening hike to see lava entering the sea. This tour, on Sunday and
Thursday, costs $50 ($36 if you stay at the lodge).
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday and Friday, Arnott's leads a tour to Mauna Kea's
summit, 13,796 feet up, and the space observatory there. The trek,
which includes a quarter-mile hike to the summit, is $75; parkas
are provided.
</P>
<P>
   Arnott's offers a variety of accommodations, from tents to a
suite for five, for $9 to $105 a night. Call (808) 969-7097, fax
(808) 961-9638; www.arnottslodge.com.
</P>
<P>
   For a different view of the lava flow, Blue Hawaiian
Helicopters, (808) 961-5600, has daily 50- or 65-minute flights
from Hilo for $130 and $175 a person, and from Waikoloa, on the
west, for $290 for two hours.
</P>
<P>
   To learn more about tours, contact the Hawaii Convention and
Visitors Bureau, 250 Keawe Street, Hilo, Hawaii 96720; (808)
961-5797, fax (808) 961-2126; www.gohawaii.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q. My brother and his family live in Minneapolis, and our
families are looking for a summer vacation spot halfway between us.
We both have children and we like hiking, biking, etc. We need
pools and amusement parks for the kids. Any ideas? _ Paulette
DeRito, Ridgefield, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   A. Using driving directions from the Web site www.mapquest.com,
the halfway point of the 1,267-mile drive between your homes is
somewhere near Toledo, Ohio. That may not be a place that comes up
much in vacation planning, but a little to the east, toward
Sandusky, Ohio, is the Lake Erie Islands region, a center of
outdoor activity, especially fishing, and historical sites.
</P>
<P>
   Among the area's attractions is East Harbor State Park, on
Marblehead Peninsula. Its 1,152 acres offer a campground, boating,
fishing in the ``walleye capital of the world,'' seven miles of
hiking trails, a beach and picnicking. At the eastern end of the
peninsula is the oldest operating lighthouse on Lake Erie.
</P>
<P>
   In between is Lakeside, a Chautauqua-like village that offers
recreation, concerts and educational seminars in the summer. Four
miles into Lake Erie is Kelleys Island, which includes Glacial
Grooves _ ancient hieroglyphics carved in rock by the Erie Indians
_ and hiking, boating and a tram tour of the island.
</P>
<P>
   Another boat ride can take you to Put-in-Bay, a Victorian
village on South Bass Island, where most people travel by golf cart
or bicycle. Among the places to ride to are the Put-in-Bay Historic
Fish Hatchery, with free tours, and the Perry's Victory and
International Peace Memorial, a 352-foot Doric column with an
observation platform commemorating Commodore Perry's War of 1812
triumph at the Battle of Lake Erie. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Back on the mainland, the kids can seek thrills at Cedar Point
Amusement Park and Resort, in Sandusky. This park has rides for all
ages, including 12 roller coasters, and next door is Soak City
Water Park. There are two hotels and a campground at the complex.
</P>
<P>
   To learn more, contact the Ottawa County Visitors Bureau, 109
Madison Street, Port Clinton, Ohio 43452; (800) 441-1271, fax (419)
734-9798, www.lake-erie.com.
</P>
<P>
   To equalize the driving even more, you could take a slightly
more northerly route _ to Flint, Mich., exactly 690 miles from each
of your towns, according to Mapquest.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen state recreational areas are within an hour's
drive of Flint, and Chris Groff, a spokesman for the state's Parks
and Recreation Division, said several offer excellent mountain
biking and hiking. These include Seven Lakes State Park in Monroe,
Brighton Recreation Area in Howell and the Ortonville Recreation
Area in Ortonville.
</P>
<P>
   Among attractions in or near Flint is Crossroads Village and
Huckleberry Railroad, a simulated 18th-century village with
blacksmithing demonstrations, old-time rides like a Ferris wheel
and a carousel, a paddlewheel riverboat and a narrow-gauge train.
Flint has a children's museum and the Museum of African-American
History-Flint.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the many attractions of the Detroit-Dearborn area are
about an hour away by car.
</P>
<P>
   Contact the Michigan Travel Bureau, Post Office Box 30226,
Lansing, Mich. 48909, (800) 543-2937, and www.michigan.org; or
Flint Area Convention and Visitors Bureau, 519 South Saginaw
Street, Flint, Mich. 48502; (810) 232-8900, fax (810) 232-1515, and

CAR USERS FACE INCREASING FEES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 20) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the densely printed ``cardmember agreement'' arrives with
your charge- and credit-card bills, read it if the type is not too
small, or at least save it to read when the light is better.
</P>
<P>
   These sheets contain a certain amount of news, which is to say,
bad news, for you as a consumer, if you are using your cards to pay
charges overseas or if you are carrying a balance on big-ticket
items like air tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Holders of the 68 million Citibank Mastercards and Citibank Visa
cards issued in the United States are learning that the fee for
converting such transactions as a dinner in Tuscany or a car-rental
in Paris will rise. Holders of these cards _ Citibank says it has
the largest total of any bank card in the country _ are getting
notices of changes from the issuing bank, Citibank South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   The fee added to the bill for foreign charges, previously 1
percent, is rising. For the moment, charges that appear on the bill
in December will be 2 percent, a Citibank spokeswoman said. But the
bank has left itself the option of raising this to 3 percent
without further notice.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the impact is not overwhelming. A bill of 826,500
lire for a hotel room, or $500 at a rate of 1,653 lire to the
dollar, which was subject to a $5 fee, would be increased by $10
now, possibly $15 at a later date. The fee is not broken out, so it
is not apparent in a casual look at the bill.
</P>
<P>
   But it is another small nibble by what Consumer Action, an
advocacy group, calls an aggressive strategy of increasing bank
yield on cards.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the dollar is steady against the currency of the
country where the charge was made, this fee increase does not alter
the basic counsel that charging hotels, meals, cars and merchandise
overseas is a better deal than converting dollars or traveler's
checks to a local currency and paying in cash.
</P>
<P>
   This principle is particularly worth remembering if you consider
converting dollars to local money at a currency-conversion counter,
where the rates are less favorable than at banks or post offices.
The conversion to dollars that the credit-card banks make before
billing you is at a more favorable rate than an individual gets; it
will be about the same as the rate banks give each other for bulk
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for charging an expense is more emphatic when there
is the possibility the value of the dollar may improve against the
local currency in the time between the eating of the meal and the
day the bank credits the restaurant's account.
</P>
<P>
   The use of electronic transmission, where the cashier swipes the
black strip of the card through a reader, is shrinking this time
lag, of course. When my card is swiped, I imagine I can hear my
Velcro wallet tearing open and money sliding out.
</P>
<P>
   Citibank is not calling attention to the new charges; Michael P.
Prince, executive director of the Goodspeed Opera House in East
Haddam, Conn., spotted the 3 percent note in the bank's ``Notice of
Changes in Terms to Your Citibank Card Agreement'' and mailed a
copy to The Times.
</P>
<P>
   Most other charge cards are apparently staying with a 1 percent
fee for conversion from foreign currencies. Consumer Action, a
nonprofit advocacy group in San Francisco, pointed out that the
Providian Bank, of San Francisco, had gone to 5 percent for
foreign-currency conversions on its cards, but that it knew of no
other bank adding that much.
</P>
<P>
   American Express is still at 1 percent, where it has been for at
least 10 years, according to Emily Porter, a spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   There have been several other modifications _ upward _ in the
cost of using charge cards. After an annual survey, Consumer Action
and another national nonprofit organization, the Consumer
Federation of America, reported jointly last month that the banking
industry was acting widely to increase credit card income.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although the report said that the average annual interest rate
in late 1998, 15.25 percent, was only slightly higher than in
recent years, banks are steadily pushing up other charges to get
more out of the credit cards they issue.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Mendler, a spokeswoman for Citibank, explained that up to
now, the Visa and Mastercard organizations have been levying a fee
for converting a charge to dollars that amounts to 1 percent of the
amount charged. The two card brands define it differently, but the
impact is the same. The yield from this fee has been retained by
Visa and Mastercard.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Ms. Mendler said, the bank wants to ``offset the higher
cost'' of doing such business, and has announced the fee increase.
</P>
<P>
   Other changes in Citibank card fees will affect those who carry
big balances, often for airline tickets or tours. Finance charges
on the unpaid balance are now to be calculated by a daily
compounding method, rather than on a monthly average. This raises
the cost to the consumer, Ms. Mendler said.
</P>
<P>
   The charge for cash advances _ on top of the finance charge for
an unpaid balance _ has been raised to 3 percent, from 2.5 percent,
of the outstanding amount, with a minimum of $5 a month, up from
$2. Credit-card cash advances obtained at ATMs in the United States
may also incur a one-time charge of up to $1.50.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the pileup of charges these fees could produce,
Ms. Mendler said that Citibank discouraged the use of cash advances
through a credit card except in emergencies. ``We still do not have
an annual fee,'' Ms. Mendler said, noting that some cards did,
particularly those with double brands offered by airlines. ``But we
have seen other fees rise.''
</P>
<P>
   When I opened a recent mailing from American Express, it noted
changes under the heading ``Charges Made in Foreign Currencies,''
but the change was not in the 1 percent conversion fee. Rather, it
involved the company's way of establishing an exchange rate for its
foreign-currency charges, Ms. Porter said.
</P>
<P>
   American Express has gone from using a particular interbank rate
for the day the charge is recorded to setting a ``competitive''
daily rate of its own, based on interbank rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes this will be better for card members than before,''
Ms. Porter said. ``Sometimes it will be better for the company.''
Card holders are being notified now, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The fee increases that Consumer Action found in its survey are
all levied on accounts that are not paid in full every month, on
time. Some of these may explain why some people sense that their
cards are costing more.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, grace periods for those who have not been carrying
an unpaid balance have been shortened by some banks from the
customary 25 days to 20, which means that interest will be charged
sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Late-payment fees have also risen, some to $29, from $25. The
survey found that 39 banks surveyed in 1995 and 1998 had raised
their late fees considerably _ to an average of $21.82, from
$12.53.
</P>
<P>
   The Credit Card Survey, based on information gathered in August
and September, can be obtained by sending a self-addressed envelope
with 55 cents postage to Consumer Action-CC, 717 Market Street,
Suite 310, San Francisco, Calif. 94103. It is also available on the
Web at www.consumer-action.org.

   When you visit a city, the local newspaper can give you a feel
for what the people there are talking about, shopping for, living
in. Weather forecasts can be vital on a vacation, theater and movie
listings can take you out of the rain, and the doings of the local
sports teams provide a conversational entry with strangers.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays you don't have to wait until you get to a city to buy
the newspaper. Many newspapers are on the World Wide Web in full or
abbreviated form. I sampled a bunch in or near places where
visitors are likely to go, to see how useful they were.
</P>
<P>
   Usefulness varied widely, of course, as did ease of navigating
the sites, but all were handy and up-to-the-minute guides even when
they were not primarily aimed at travelers. Newspaper Web sites
should be available on any of the search engines.
</P>
<P>
   The path in Yahoo is News and Media, Newspapers. In Excite, the
path is News, U.S. Newspapers. If you are persevering you can even
find the sites on Alta Vista, where the path is Media and
Entertainment, News and Magazines, News and Newspapers. Best of
all, perhaps, is newspaperlinks.com, which provides connections to
more than 1,700 newspapers in the United States and Canada. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Republic, at www.azcentral.com, cares about the
weather. There are forecasts for 27 cities, including such familiar
names as Phoenix, Tucson and Flagstaff, and such outre ones as
Bullhead City, Quartzsite and, yes, Tombstone. There is also a
calendar of events, a city guide, articles about the state and a
list of places to hike.
</P>
<P>
   The city guide section leads to the independent sites of 28
communities, with information and favorable views of
accom-modations, dining and recreation. A further click takes you
to Arizona Guide, the site of the Arizona office of tourism, with
topics ranging from the Grand Canyon to deserts.online &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Across the country in the Southeast, The Miami Herald,
www.herald.com, offers a large selection from the previous Sunday's
travel section. Not all the articles are local, but the day I
dropped in there was one about a Peruvian art exhibition at St.
Petersburg's Florida International Museum.
</P>
<P>
   A ``traveling cheaply'' section was divided into bargain fares,
off-season travel, special deals and ways to accu-mulate miles
without actually flying. But look in the Living/Arts section, not
travel, for places to eat, music to hear and movies to see. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The San Jose Mercury News, www5. mercurycenter.com, is huge. A
lengthy index runs from A (the A's Strike Zone) to Y (the Yellow
Pages). The icon I thought would take me to the travel section
actually connected to an independent site, www. sfbaytraveler.com,
emphasizing Northern California but with destinations as
wide-ranging as Alaska and Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   I did eventually find articles from the previous travel section
(``Overnight flights are called red-eyes for a good reason''), and
a news library enables you to ``search the archives of the San Jose
Mercury News and more than two dozen Knight-Ridder and other
newspapers.'' The index is also the place to look for entertainment
news, under both Entertainment and Just Go.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't find where accommodations are hidden in this vast
space, if they are, but a search for the word ``hotels'' brought up
49 articles, from ``How not to run online reservations'' to ``Probe
of girl's fall may wrap up soon.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't find a section named Travel in The Rocky Mountain
News, which is at www.insidedenver.com, but under Recreation there
was a snow section with nearly 30 resorts listed. There were also
close to 30 headlines leading to such news stories as ``Gart-Vail
hookup eases buying passes'' and ``Skiers asked to stay within
bound-aries.'' The Going Out section has movies, dining, theater
and music. Under dining there were 15 recent restaurant reviews. &QL;

 &HT;    CLINTON LEAVES MIDEAST WITH NO PROMISE OF TROOP WITHDRAWAL,
PEACE PROCESS STRUGGLING HIS WAKE
 &HT;    With CLINTON-PASTOR-1216.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Mixing powerful symbols of historic sacrifice and
seasonal hope, President Clinton wrapped up a difficult visit to
this turbulent region on Tuesday, conceding that the heart of the
imperiled Mideast peace process is barely beating and faces added
strains in the weeks ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to gird that process for further stress, Clinton pulled
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat together for a 90-minute meeting at the border town
of Erez, south of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing of substance could be resolved, however, and the two men
could agree only to activate a handful of committees to take up a
host of thorny security and law enforcement issues and, ostensibly
at least, to try to speed the flow of the economic and social
benefits of peace to some increasingly restive pockets of
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   And, with the clock ticking on a May 4 deadline set five years
ago for negotiating a comprehensive Israeli-Palestinian peace
agreement, Clinton was unable to persuade Netanyahu to proceed with
additional promised troop withdrawals from parts of the occupied
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to resolve a number of issues in order for the
redeployment to go forward,'' said Clinton. ''I hope we can keep
pretty much to the schedule that's here. But, obviously, that
remains to be worked out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Distrust between Netanyahu and Arafat remained so deep, however,
that little progress appeared likely without the direct involvement
of Clinton, who said he would send U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright back to the region early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll just keep at it,'' Clinton told reporters. ''We'll have
fits and starts . . . but we'll get through this.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was to return to Washington -- and an impending
impeachment vote -- late Tuesday night, after an historic three-day
visit to Israel and Palestinian-controlled Gaza. Following a day of
sightseeing, the president and his family climbed aboard Air Force
One and headed home, due back at the White House just 34 hours
before the full House opens debate on four articles of impeachment
that could lead to his removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides held Wednesday's schedule open for Clinton to
meet or talk by phone with any lawmakers seeking last-minute
answers or assurances. The Senate will decide Clinton's fate if the
House approves any of the impeachment charges.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the grave threat to his presidency, Clinton did not seem
particularly troubled as he spent the day Tuesday visiting the
supposed site of the birth of Christ, in the nearby
Palestinian-controlled city of Bethlehem, and Masada, a craggy
mountain plateau where Jews in revolt against Roman occupation
forces staged a bold, but ultimately tragic, last stand nearly
2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The time Clinton spent noting the origins of Christianity and
the long and often painful history of Judaism lent dramatic
symbolism to three days of tough diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   The visit was agreed upon by both sides as part of the interim
peace accords Clinton brokered between Arafat and Netanyahu last
October at the Wye River Plantation retreat in rural Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the visit was Clinton's journey on Monday to
Palestinian-controlled Gaza and his address there to several
hundred members of the Palestinian National Council, who affirmed
the removal from the Palestinian charter of a host of decades-old
provisions calling for the destruction of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   What was meant to be a largely ceremonial step in cementing the
accords, however, turned into a rescue mission, with Clinton
applying the diplomatic equivalent of CPR to try to keep the peace
process alive.
</P>
<P>
   He appeared to manage that, but White House officials made clear
that little progress is expected in the peace process until
Netanyahu's precarious political position is worked through, one
way or another.
</P>
<P>
   The embattled Israeli prime minister faces a critical test next
week, with Israel's parliament, the Knesset, expected to take up a
possible no-confidence vote as early as Monday. A loss could result
in elections in three months, a process that would again place on
hold the prospect of meaningful progress toward peace, particularly
on the issue of Israeli troop redeployments from occupied
territories.
</P>
<P>
   That issue lies near the heart of a peace process based on the
transfer of certain Israeli-occupied territories to Palestinian
control.
</P>
<P>
   At Wye, Netanyahu agreed to transfer an additional 13 percent of
the occupied West Bank to Palestinian control. The transfer was to
take place in three phases. The first redeployment went forward
last month; the second was to be completed by this Friday, but
Netanyahu suspended that phase last week in the face of mounting
street demonstrations and attacks on Israelis by Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to resolve a number of issues in order for the
redeployment to go forward,'' Clinton said. ''I hope we can keep
pretty much to the schedule that's here. But, obviously, that
remains to be worked out here.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Palestinian side, though, patience is wearing thin.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of an Israeli-Palestinian agreement signed on
the White House lawn in 1993, both sides are supposed to complete a
comprehensive peace accord -- that would settle once and for all
the toughest issues between them, including the future of Jerusalem
and the question of a Palestinian state -- by May 4.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has repeatedly warned that he would unilaterally declare
a Palestinian state in areas of Palestinian control, and perhaps
other territories now occupied by Israelis, if that deadline isn't
met. Netanyahu has responded by threatening to annex
Palestinian-controlled lands if Arafat tries to create a state on
his own.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, however, voiced hope that diplomacy can avert a
showdown, but he made clear that tough work lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ''The proof is always in what happens tomorrow, not what happens
today,'' Clinton said, ''but I think at least we've got a process
set up and we can go forward.''

THE MAMA OF YA-YA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By M.L. LYKE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ An assistant quietly eases from the room and, moments
later, there she is _ the high priestess of Ya-Ya, the drama mama
of Louisiana soul, the First Lady's first lady of literature,
thunking purposely across the room in a pair of high-heeled cowgirl
boots, a gracious Southern smile playing across the most perfect
little lips you've seen north of the Mason-Dixon line.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole thing is such a scream, such a total, total scream.
We're all just cracking up,'' says Rebecca Wells, settling on the
couch inside her Seattle rental. The lips are painted a shade of
copper that matches her exuberant red hair, spiked and headed off
in a dozen directions. Even the big evergreen eyes are outlined in
copper.
</P>
<P>
   The ``whole thing,'' or ``whole thang'' as it translates in
Wells' melodic Louisiana twang, is a miracle. A publishing miracle.
</P>
<P>
   It began in 1996, when her novel ``The Divine Secrets of the
Ya-Ya Sisterhood''_ a simmering gumbo of Louisiana love and
laughter and go-girl sisterhood _ made its hardback debut to spotty
reviews and modest sales.
</P>
<P>
   Original release of the book _ about a tight tribe of
girlfriends called the Ya-Yas who vow to ``smoke, drink, never
think'' _ was 13,000 copies. When the trade paperback came out in
spring of '97, publishers printed 18,000 copies, unaware of the
gathering power of Ya-Ya.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures seem laughable today. Spurred by word-of-mouth
recommendations, ``Divine Secrets'' has taken off like a duck
flushed from a Louisiana marsh.
</P>
<P>
   Sales now top 1.9 million copies. More than 100,000 new reprints
are shipped each month. And three years after the book's quiet
debut, the paperback nests comfortably near the top of The New York
Times best-seller list _ 44 straight weeks, No. 3 this coming
Sunday _ accompanied by Wells' rediscovered ``Little Altars
Everywhere,'' first published in 1992 by Broken Moon Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing this for 30 years, and I can't remember this
ever happening before. It is publishing history,'' says Diane
Reverand, Wells' editor at HarperCollins.
</P>
<P>
   The petite Southern belle who unleashed this gale-force
phenomenon is thrilled _ and not just for herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it heartful that, in this corporate culture of ours,
with no big publicity push, something like this can break
through,'' says Wells, who toured the book through small-town
America.
</P>
<P>
   The writer/actress/playwright turned readings into riveting
performances of wild laughter and low whispers, her rhinestones
sparkling under flickering fluorescent lights as she sashayed and
uhn-huhned like a novel-thumpin' evangelist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea this would happen,'' says Wells, dramatic
eyebrows arched above the sea of green. ``But I knew _ (whispering)
Ah just knew _ that the people who read this book were passionate.
I could feel that passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Like its creator, the book defies conventionality. In
pitch-perfect dialogue, it continues the story of the Walker family
of Thornton, La., begun in ``Little Altars Everywhere.'' The plot
centers on the relationship of playwright Siddalee Walker, holed up
at a lodge on Lake Quinault, and her complicated, fun-loving,
hard-drinking, Mommie Dearest mama, Vivi, at home in Thornton
seething _ simply seething, dahlin'.
</P>
<P>
   The cause is a New York Times interview with Sidda that names
Vivi ``a tap-dancing child abuser.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My love was a gift. I take it back,'' sniffs Vivi, dubbed
Queen Dancing Creek in a Ya-Ya initiation ceremony some 50 years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Mother and daughter need desperately to forgive one another, and
the remaining Ya-Yas arrive at Siddalee's doorstep to engineer a
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are imperfect, our parents are imperfect, and part of
growing up is accepting those imperfections,'' says Wells, who
quotes Henri Nouwen at the beginning of her book:
</P>
<P>
   ``Forgiveness is the name of love practiced among people who
love poorly.''
</P>
<P>
   The message hits home, and hits hard. Ya-Ya clubs, forged in
friendship and fortified by mint juleps and Bloody Marys, have
formed across the country. Initiates adopt Ya-Ya nicknames such as
``The Duchess of Decadence'' and ``Princess Foot-in-the-Mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Letters pour in _ emotional, personal letters. Childhood friends
who haven't talked in 30 years reconnect after reading the book.
Moms and daughters heal old wounds. ``It's hard to read the fan
letters, because I always start crying,'' says Wells.
</P>
<P>
   The Ya-Ya Web site _ www.ya-ya.com _ is flooded with
sister-chat. ``This book makes me long for something I've never
had: close female friendships,'' posts the Mistress of the Moon.
``I suppose it's hard to have those when you don't trust anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Women clutch the bright blue book at airports, swim meets, bus
stations, cafeterias. Even Hillary Clinton has gone gaga on Ya-Ya,
naming the book her current pick in women's contemporary fiction in
the December issue of Vogue magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Wells discovered the quote while relaxing with the magazine over
Thanksgiving weekend. ``I read to the bottom of a column where it
said that her recent favorite is `Divine Secrets.' I thought,
`That's it! There's another woman with a book that has a name a lot
like mine.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I read to the top of the next column and it said `of the
Ya-Ya Sisterhood.' I just started screaming!''
</P>
<P>
   Publicity has been fierce, and Wells has had to pick and choose
engagements, with assistants helping handle the onslaught. Since
May, she has been featured in Newsweek, People magazine and USA
Today. On Dec. 28 she'll be interviewed on CBS as one of Ladies
Home Journal's ``most fascinating women of 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a far cry from the days when Wells, photographer husband
Tom Schworer and friends concocted a fake publicity office in
Seattle to try to draw attention to her first literary lovechild,
``Little Altars Everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We set up our own little press agency, with our own letterhead
and little logo. I'd fake voices over the phone: `Hello? This is
Lilly Edmond calling for Rebecca Wells? We were just wondering if
you received the papers from the Beaumont agency?''
</P>
<P>
   Wells' buttoned-up Yankee clip is utterly convincing. So are the
other dozen voices the high-energy artist employs during the course
of an interview. Her sentences may erupt in loud, loose laughter,
quiver softly with emotion or stand up proud and defiant as she
pops in and out of her seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never expected this _ never!,'' she says, hands dancing in
time to the words. ``You write a book and you have absolutely no
hint that anybody other than you will find it a) interesting, b)
touching, c) funny.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're out there in the middle of the ocean in this tiny
rickety little boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Born Feb. 3, 1953, on a working plantation in central Louisiana
and raised Catholic, Wells showed a dramatic flair from the get-go.
She was a stylin' toddler, wrapping herself in curtains, scarves
and hats, and playing Queen of Sheba.
</P>
<P>
   By school age, she was putting on shows with her four brothers
and sisters, cousins and friends. She graduated with a degree in
English from the University of Georgia and studied language and
consciousness with Allen Ginsberg and Choyam Trungapa Rinpoche at
the Naropa Institute in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Before coming to Seattle, she worked off-Broadway in New York,
where she studied the Stanislavski method of acting. Wells hit
Seattle in the early '80s, arriving to form a chapter of Performing
Artists for Nuclear Disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   Taken by the green beauty and oyster quality of light in the
Northwest, she decided to stay _ despite the siren call of Cajun
French, bayou boogie, Spanish moss, velvet air and Southern love
and lunacy that continues to draw her home for extended stays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Louisiana is another world, a world lost in time,'' she says.
``It's not caught into the cyberwired, nanosecond culture that
we're in danger of being just strangled by.''
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, the gifted actress developed some wonderfully
offbeat plays. One was ``Gloria Duplex,'' about a New Orleans
stripper who sees the face of God in the mirror ball of the Kitten
Paradise Temple and Lounge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why'd you show your face to me?'' Gloria complains. ``I don't
even have a high school diploma.''
</P>
<P>
   Another was the beloved one-woman show ``Splittin' Hairs.'' In
it, Louisiana beautician Loretta Endless, owner of Loretta's Cut
'n' Curls, obsesses over the effects of nuclear radiation on the
human body.
</P>
<P>
   Wells' current project is to put Loretta's story into novel
form. ``She's always wanted her own book,'' says Wells, who
squirreled away in a friend's house in the middle of a Louisiana
cane field earlier this year to work on it.
</P>
<P>
   She prepared for work each day with meditation and inspirational
readings, and next to her computer she placed a timer, set to go
off every 20 minutes. When it buzzed, she rose from her seat, put
on some swamp pop, and danced with Ya-Ya abandon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to think that if I got up when I was writing, I'd lose
the thread _ `It's gone! It's only given to you once, and you'd
better sit there till your butt melts off!'
</P>
<P>
   ``That's really a belief in the scarcity and stinginess of the
universe and the muse. And I think more and more that the inspiring
forces understand us as imperfect human beings who work in these
bodies _ and that they actually smile when we honor them.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells, who returned to Seattle in early fall, is also working on
a follow-up novel to ``Divine Secrets'' and recently finished
recording the Harper Audio version of ``Little Altars'' _ who else
would do it, y'all?
</P>
<P>
   The tape comes on the heels of her dramatic reading of ``Divine
Secrets,'' already steaming up audio book charts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Altars,'' with its myriad points of view, liked to kill her,
says Wells. ``To bring off all those characters, to bring off the
authenticity of the different genders, the different races, the
different ages _ I haven't worked that hard as an actress in a long
time, if ever.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of the Ya-Yas is also headed for the big screen.
Actress Bette Midler and partner Bonnie Bruckheimer have optioned
``Divine Secrets'' for their All-Girl Productions company. The film
will be made at Warner Bros.
</P>
<P>
   Wells understands the draw of Ya-Ya, intimately. The book, she
says, has changed her life, and changed it in a way that has
nothing to do with megabucks sales, overwrought schedules or media
hoopla. ``I learned about my own loneliness for sisterhood as I was
writing the book,'' she says. ``I learned I was longing for deep
female friendships.''
</P>
<P>
   She, too, began cultivating Ya-Ya friendships, old and new, as a
result.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book taught me to go back to that vulnerable seventh-grade
part of myself.'' Wells' voice turns tentative and earnest as an
awkward adolescent's. ``It's the part that says, `Will you be my
girlfriend? I really like you, will you be my friend?'
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ya-Yas brought me back to that girlself.''
</P>
<P>
   For a moment, all is still. Then the drama mama of Louisiana
soul softly continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I believe is that you just have to humble yourself to
life. You have to humble yourself to the possibilities of love.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the different kinds,'' she whispers. ``All the different
kinds that there are.''

HISTORY LESSON: CHRISTMAS FOR JEWS 
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID GREENBERG 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The holiday season is upon us. Not the ``Christmas season'' but
the ``holiday season''--a euphemism for ``Christmas with Hanukkah
(and, perhaps, Kwanzaa) thrown in.''
</P>
<P>
   If you place a tree in the town square, you need a menorah as
well. We festoon offices with blue and silver Hanukkah decorations
alongside Christmas trimmings, and on the Sesame Street Christmas
special, Big Bird wishes Mr. Hooper a Happy Hanukkah. The only
meaning of the phrase ``Judeo-Christian,'' it seems, is the fusion
of these two otherwise unrelated holidays into one big seasonal
spree.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, as any rabbi will tell you, is that Hanukkah has
traditionally been a minor Jewish festival. It commemorates the
successful Israelite revolt in the second century B.C. against
their Syrian oppressors, and their refusal to assimilate into the
prevailing Hellenistic culture. Specifically, it celebrates the
miracle in which, according to lore, a day's worth of oil fueled
the candelabra of the Jews' rededicated temple for eight days.
Until recently, this observance paled next to the High Holy Days,
Passover, even Purim. So how did it become ``the Jewish
Christmas''? And is this good for the Jews?
</P>
<P>
   First, Christmas had to become Christmas, which originally
wasn't a big deal in America. The Puritans who settled
Massachusetts made it a crime to celebrate the holiday (punishment:
five shillings). Only with the arrival of German immigrants after
the Civil War did it emerge as the major American feast. With the
revolution in retailing--marked by the rise of department stores
and advertising--celebrations focused on throwing parties, buying
and giving gifts, and sending greeting cards (first sold in 1874,
they became a million dollar business within a few years). The
Coca-Cola Co. adopted as its logo a jolly bearded man in a red and
white suit, and Santa bypassed Jesus as Christmas' main icon.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the Jews. Around 1900, millions of eastern European Jews
came to the United States, congregating in urban enclaves such as
New York's Lower East Side. Most adopted American traditions,
including the newly secularized Christmas. ``Santa Claus visited
the East Side last night,'' the New York Tribune noted on Christmas
Day, 1904, ``and hardly missed a tenement house.'' Jews installed
Christmas trees in their homes and thought nothing of the carols
their children sang in the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The second generation of American Jews challenged this embrace
of a festival that, despite its secular trappings, was
fundamentally Christian. But parents couldn't very well deprive
their kids of gifts or seasonal merriment, and Hanukkah benefited
from convenient timing. Instead of giving the traditional ``gelt,''
or money, Jews celebrated with presents, so as not to fall short of
their Christian neighbors. Prominent religious leaders, more secure
with maintaining a Jewish identity in America, now urged schools to
let Jews abstain from yuletide celebrations or to provide
all-purpose holiday parties instead. Lighting the menorah proved a
satisfying alternative to adorning a tree with colorful lights.
</P>
<P>
   Zionism, which gathered converts in the years before World War
II, also boosted Hanukkah's stock. The holiday's emphasis on
self-reliance and military strength in the face of persecution
dovetailed with the themes of nationalists seeking to establish a
Jewish state. The warrior-hero Judah Maccabee, leader of an ancient
revolt, morphed into a proto-Zionist pioneer. At first, Zionist
organizations used the holiday as an excuse to prod individuals to
donate coins to the cause. In later years they packed Madison
Square Garden for Hanukkah fund-raising galas, featuring such
keynoters as Albert Einstein and New York Gov. Herbert Lehman.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, as Jews moved with other Americans to
suburbia, Hanukkah shored up its place as their No. 1 holiday. In
the early '50s, in a famous Middletown-style study of a Chicago
suburb referred to as ``Lakeville,'' sociologist Marshall Sklare
found that lighting the Hanukkah candles ranked as the most popular
``mitzvah,'' above hosting a Passover Seder and observing the
Sabbath. Sklare attributed the holiday's popularity to its easy
accommodation to Christmas rituals as well as to its ability to be
redefined for modern times. The Hanukkah lesson being taught,
Sklare noted, was no longer reverence to God for performing a
miracle but rather the triumph over religious intolerance--a
perfect message for liberal America in the age of the civil rights
movement.
</P>
<P>
   These Ozzie and Harriet Jews also modified their observances for
the 1950s home. As one historian has written, a Jewish guidebook
from the era included recipes for '' 'Maccabean sandwiches'
composed of either tuna fish or egg salad and shaped to resemble a
bite-sized Maccabee warrior, or the 'Menorah fruit salad,' a
composition of cream cheese and fruit that, when molded,
</P>
<P>
   resembled a menorah.'' By the late '50s, ``Chanukah's
accoutrements had grown to include paper decorations, greeting
cards, napkins, wrapping paper, ribbons, chocolates, games and
phonograph records.'' Like Gentiles, Jews extended gift-giving to
adults; the Hadassah Newsletter pointed out that ``Mah-jong sets
make appreciated Chanukah gifts.'' Parents could now assure
children that Hanukkah wasn't a poor man's Christmas but was, in
fact, a ``better'' holiday because it meant presents for eight days
straight.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Jews have become more integrated into American life,
and Hanukkah has embedded itself in television, office parties,
Hallmark stores, Barnes &AMP; Nobles, and other leading American
cultural institutions. Except among the Orthodox, it has been
thoroughly transformed into a major festival. Accordingly,
religious leaders lament this development as another instance of
the Jews' perilous assimilation--if not into a Christian society
then into a secular, commercial one.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the recent evolution of Hanukkah represents not a
capitulation to the forces of Christmas but an assertion of
Jewishness amid a multicultural society. Just as Kwanzaa, created
in 1966, has returned many black Americans to their African
heritage, so Hanukkah has helped tether Jews to their heritage and
in some cases has brought them back to the fold. In a 1985 study,
journalist Charles Silberman recounted how the writer Anne Roiphe,
besieged with angry letters after she wrote an article about
celebrating Christmas as a Jew, switched to observing Hanukkah and
found it far more meaningful. Likewise, Silberman noted, more
American Jews than ever preferred Hanukkah to Christmas. Three out
of four lighted the menorah, an increase even over the 68 percent
in Sklare's 1950s study. In 1998, the adherence to a modest Jewish
ritual such as celebrating Hanukkah follows in the tradition of the
ancient Israelites, who spurned the pressures to adopt Hellenism.
Indeed, in acculturating to America while maintaining a
</P>
<P>
   Jewish identity, observers of Hanukkah may well be doing Judah
Maccabee proud.

HISTORY LESSON: CHRISTMAS FOR JEWS 
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID GREENBERG 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The holiday season is upon us. Not the ``Christmas season'' but
the ``holiday season''--a euphemism for ``Christmas with Hanukkah
(and, perhaps, Kwanzaa) thrown in.''
</P>
<P>
   If you place a tree in the town square, you need a menorah as
well. We festoon offices with blue and silver Hanukkah decorations
alongside Christmas trimmings, and on the Sesame Street Christmas
special, Big Bird wishes Mr. Hooper a Happy Hanukkah. The only
meaning of the phrase ``Judeo-Christian,'' it seems, is the fusion
of these two otherwise unrelated holidays into one big seasonal
spree.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, as any rabbi will tell you, is that Hanukkah has
traditionally been a minor Jewish festival. It commemorates the
successful Israelite revolt in the second century B.C. against
their Syrian oppressors, and their refusal to assimilate into the
prevailing Hellenistic culture. Specifically, it celebrates the
miracle in which, according to lore, a day's worth of oil fueled
the candelabra of the Jews' rededicated temple for eight days.
Until recently, this observance paled next to the High Holy Days,
Passover, even Purim. So how did it become ``the Jewish
Christmas''? And is this good for the Jews?
</P>
<P>
   First, Christmas had to become Christmas, which originally
wasn't a big deal in America. The Puritans who settled
Massachusetts made it a crime to celebrate the holiday (punishment:
five shillings). Only with the arrival of German immigrants after
the Civil War did it emerge as the major American feast. With the
revolution in retailing--marked by the rise of department stores
and advertising--celebrations focused on throwing parties, buying
and giving gifts, and sending greeting cards (first sold in 1874,
they became a million dollar business within a few years). The
Coca-Cola Co. adopted as its logo a jolly bearded man in a red and
white suit, and Santa bypassed Jesus as Christmas' main icon.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the Jews. Around 1900, millions of eastern European Jews
came to the United States, congregating in urban enclaves such as
New York's Lower East Side. Most adopted American traditions,
including the newly secularized Christmas. ``Santa Claus visited
the East Side last night,'' the New York Tribune noted on Christmas
Day, 1904, ``and hardly missed a tenement house.'' Jews installed
Christmas trees in their homes and thought nothing of the carols
their children sang in the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The second generation of American Jews challenged this embrace
of a festival that, despite its secular trappings, was
fundamentally Christian. But parents couldn't very well deprive
their kids of gifts or seasonal merriment, and Hanukkah benefited
from convenient timing. Instead of giving the traditional ``gelt,''
or money, Jews celebrated with presents, so as not to fall short of
their Christian neighbors. Prominent religious leaders, more secure
with maintaining a Jewish identity in America, now urged schools to
let Jews abstain from yuletide celebrations or to provide
all-purpose holiday parties instead. Lighting the menorah proved a
satisfying alternative to adorning a tree with colorful lights.
</P>
<P>
   Zionism, which gathered converts in the years before World War
II, also boosted Hanukkah's stock. The holiday's emphasis on
self-reliance and military strength in the face of persecution
dovetailed with the themes of nationalists seeking to establish a
Jewish state. The warrior-hero Judah Maccabee, leader of an ancient
revolt, morphed into a proto-Zionist pioneer. At first, Zionist
organizations used the holiday as an excuse to prod individuals to
donate coins to the cause. In later years they packed Madison
Square Garden for Hanukkah fund-raising galas, featuring such
keynoters as Albert Einstein and New York Gov. Herbert Lehman.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, as Jews moved with other Americans to
suburbia, Hanukkah shored up its place as their No. 1 holiday. In
the early '50s, in a famous Middletown-style study of a Chicago
suburb referred to as ``Lakeville,'' sociologist Marshall Sklare
found that lighting the Hanukkah candles ranked as the most popular
``mitzvah,'' above hosting a Passover Seder and observing the
Sabbath. Sklare attributed the holiday's popularity to its easy
accommodation to Christmas rituals as well as to its ability to be
redefined for modern times. The Hanukkah lesson being taught,
Sklare noted, was no longer reverence to God for performing a
miracle but rather the triumph over religious intolerance--a
perfect message for liberal America in the age of the civil rights
movement.
</P>
<P>
   These Ozzie and Harriet Jews also modified their observances for
the 1950s home. As one historian has written, a Jewish guidebook
from the era included recipes for '' 'Maccabean sandwiches'
composed of either tuna fish or egg salad and shaped to resemble a
bite-sized Maccabee warrior, or the 'Menorah fruit salad,' a
composition of cream cheese and fruit that, when molded,
</P>
<P>
   resembled a menorah.'' By the late '50s, ``Chanukah's
accoutrements had grown to include paper decorations, greeting
cards, napkins, wrapping paper, ribbons, chocolates, games and
phonograph records.'' Like Gentiles, Jews extended gift-giving to
adults; the Hadassah Newsletter pointed out that ``Mah-jong sets
make appreciated Chanukah gifts.'' Parents could now assure
children that Hanukkah wasn't a poor man's Christmas but was, in
fact, a ``better'' holiday because it meant presents for eight days
straight.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Jews have become more integrated into American life,
and Hanukkah has embedded itself in television, office parties,
Hallmark stores, Barnes &AMP; Nobles, and other leading American
cultural institutions. Except among the Orthodox, it has been
thoroughly transformed into a major festival. Accordingly,
religious leaders lament this development as another instance of
the Jews' perilous assimilation--if not into a Christian society
then into a secular, commercial one.
</P>
<P>

BROWSER: IS CAPITALISM GOOD FOR ART? 
</HEADLINE>
  By JACOB WEISBERGE 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``In Praise of Commercial Culture''
</P>
<P>
   By Tyler Cowen
</P>
<P>
   Harvard University Press; 288 pages; $27.95
</P>
<P>
   One of the most enduring and least questioned assumptions of
modern cultural criticism is that American capitalism is bad for
art. There are many variations on this prejudice. Perhaps the
oldest is the Tocquevillean strain, which contends that American
art and literature are bound to be inferior because they depend on
the largess of crass nouveaux riches rather than of cultivated
aristocrats. There is a Marxist strain, which asserts that artists
are alienated from their labor under capitalism, and a Frankfurt
School strain, which argues that a market economy produces a banal
and degraded popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   The leading opponent of this whole family of assumptions is
Tyler Cowen, an economist at George Mason University and the author
of a book titled ``In Praise of Commercial Culture,'' which was
published earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Capitalism, Cowen contends, is not only not anti-culture, it is
the best of all possible systems for culture. He describes his
position as ``cultural optimism,'' in answer to what he sees as the
long-dominant position of ``cultural pessimism.'' In his book,
Cowen make a spirited case that the free market does the best job
of supporting large numbers of artists, encouraging them to create
high-quality work, and making the best work widely available. The
United States, he believes, is a kind of art paradise, offering a
``parade of successful and diverse cultural products.'' This
analysis is provocative and interesting enough to take seriously,
even though I think it's off base.
</P>
<P>
   Cowen approaches culture the way that you might expect an
economist of libertarian leanings to approach it--as
entrepreneurial activty. According to his rational-choice view of
art, Michelangelo, Mozart and Shakespeare were all trying to
maximize their income and returns to ego by means of
self-expression.
</P>
<P>
   Cowen, who apparently spends a great deal of time consuming
culture, supports his thesis with a pretty impressive range of
evidence. With polymathic perversity, he moves from Florentine
artisanship to French Salon painting to the early days of R &AMP; B as
he collects interesting tidbits to support his case that the state
smothers artists while the market provides for them.
</P>
<P>
   Cowen sometimes sounds a bit ridiculous; he flaunts his tastes
like someone desperate to impress a date. When it comes to music,
he is a fan of Kraftwerk, Showboat, Morton Feldman, the Beach Boys,
Brahms, ``the music of the Pygmies of Central Africa,'' Benny
Goodman, Niggaz With Attitude, early Philip Glass, the Clash, and
the works of Giovanni Palestrina performed on original instruments.
Cowen's Web site lists his favorite authors, musicians, movies and
artists (Diego Velzquez, Piet Mondrian, Damien Hirst) and offers
his reviews of nearly every restaurant in the Washington area. The
names he drops sometimes crash and break. Paul Fussell is not in
fact an English snob (though he tries to sound like one), Isaac
Bashevis Singer is not an exemplar of ``the continental novel of
ideas,'' and Daniel Bell is not a neoconservative.
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, however, Cowen marshals his catholic taste
effectively. To him, cultural variety is the essence of cultural
vitality. And he is persuasive in arguing that capitalism fosters
the vast panoply of forms and expressions he enjoys. In 1947, there
were 85,000 books in print in the United States. In 1996, the
number was 1.3 million. In the same span, 357 publishers have
turned into an incredible 49,000, many of which exist to make arty
and noncommercial literature available. Elsewhere, Cowen notes that
CDs of works by even obscure contemporary classical composers can
be found for sale in suburban shopping malls. Contra the cultural
pessimists, Cowen believes that great and enduring art is being
created all over the place--even if it will only become clear with
the passage of time what it is.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the larger picture of cultural health offered here is
seriously flawed. The problem begins with Cowen's praise for the
United States as a country in which the arts are privately
supported, as opposed to Western European countries, where culture
is subsidized and protected.
</P>
<P>
   Cowen is right about the National Endowment for the Arts
debate--it's foolish to believe the fate of American civilization
hinges on the tiny amount the federal government spends on direct
arts subsidies. But he fails to appreciate the extent to which the
arts in this country are funded with indirect government subsidies,
mainly tax deductibility of charitable contributions. Cowen may
feel that this is preferable to the European system of direct
support because it is less meddlesome. But he can't pretend that
it's not a public contribution of several billion dollars a year,
which keeps a vast number of otherwise nonviable cultural
institutions in business and supplements the market's production of
pop culture with more esoteric art of the kind he responds to.
</P>
<P>
   So opposed is Cowen to the idea of government support for the
arts that he tries to extend his argument against it back in time.
One of his weirder themes is that aristocratic patronage--the
ancestor of public arts subsidies--has always been bad for art,
while commercial patronage--rich people buying works from
artists--is always good.
</P>
<P>
   This is pretty silly; whether a patron pays an artist in advance
or on delivery is a minor distinction. A less doctrinaire view
would acknowledge that there are certain kinds of art--grand opera,
monumental sculpture, highbrow filmmaking, poetry--that can seldom
sustain themselves in a commercial environment. If we want them, we
have to find a way to help them. Support that is interventionist
and heavy-handed, whether from the government or rich individuals,
can corrupt and enervate artistic creation. Enlightened support
needn't do so.
</P>
<P>
   Cowen's own logic doesn't necessarily lead to his conclusion. If
the point is to have the widest possible range of cultural choice,
a variety of economic systems might be preferable. Feudalism in its
death throes produced great 19th century Russian literature as well
as blues music, which Cowen is very fond of. Communism shaped the
writing of Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Joseph Brodsky, and Milan
Kundera as well as the most interesting films of the 1980s. In
Eastern Europe, especially, political and economic freedom appear
to be failing to produce the equal of what emerged under Communism.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't an argument for oppression. But it is an answer to
Cowen's theory that capitalism automatically produces the greatest
art. In reality, art is unpredictable and may flourish under the
most unlikely conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But the larger way Cowen is mistaken is in his flawed
presumption that cultural vitality is synonymous with variety. If
you hold the position that the healthiest civilization is the
biggest supermarket of cultural products, then all you need is an
Amazon.com for consumer capitalism to triumph. But there are more
aspects to a nation's cultural life than this quantitative view
encompasses.
</P>
<P>
   Cowen's approach gives you no sense, for example, of whether and
how much art matters to most Americans. Though probably more a
cultural optimist than pessimist, I would argue that there is too
little overlap between what's great and what's popular. High
culture in the United States is a relatively successful niche
product. What we lack is a flourishing common or national culture.
Contemporary classical music goes unperformed, foreign films have
no audience, and hardly anyone reads contemporary poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, pap abounds. Even Cowen doesn't get around to
defending our true ``commercial culture''--television, video games
and Hollywood movies. In terms an economist might understand, the
supply side of our cultural life looks pretty good. It's demand
that ought to give one pause.

MONEYBOX: IN DEFENSE OF DAY TRADERS

   While there's no question that the perpetual frenzy over
Internet stocks has added a new chapter to the long history of
financial manias and panics, there's a detectable--and
ill-conceived--snobbishness in the media's criticism of that
frenzy. (Not in my criticism, of course. Just in all the other
criticism.) That snobbishness has shown itself most clearly in the
recent uproar over the boom in day traders, who have apparently
been responsible for much of the action in Net stocks over the past
few months.
</P>
<P>
   Day trading is both a crazy way to spend your life--do you
really want to spend all day monitoring a ticker's minute
up-and-down movements?--and a fool's game for those who want to
beat the market. But pronouncements about the nefarious effects
that day trading will have on U.S. capital markets are wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's New York Times, for instance, suggested the impact of
the Internet was to create ``a model for exponential growth'' in
the spread of stock trading away from ``the purview of an elite
few.'' It argued that eventually this could mean ``a situation
where the market as we know it today cannot absorb the shock.'' The
implication was that in the good old days investors were more
rational and patient, and that as the hoi polloi get involved, the
chances for chaos grow. ``When herd behavior moves the larger
markets in these highly volatile ways,'' one source said, ``that
becomes highly problematic.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, what's problematic is the idea that as more people
become investors, the more likely you are to have fits of herd
behavior. The thing to remember, and that the Times appears to have
forgotten, is that the profit-maximizing impulses that we assume
drive institutional investors also drive individual investors, even
if they're day traders. As a result, in the collective, individual
investors are as likely to come up with the ``right'' price for an
asset as the old-boys'-network was.
</P>
<P>
   That's because although markets are not perfectly efficient,
they're pretty damn efficient. Any systematic mispricing will
almost instantly be recognized and taken advantage of, and that is
true of a market in which the traders are white-shoe traders or
short-sleeved day traders. If anything, the more people you get
involved in a market, the fewer chances for profit there will be.
</P>
<P>
   But how do we square this with the reality of Internet stock
prices, which seem by any rational measure to be insanely
overpriced and which are breathtakingly volatile? In part, it seems
to be a simple matter of supply and demand, since most Net
companies have not yet gone back to the market to offer more
shares. When they do, you should see prices decline some.
</P>
<P>
   In part, though, the prices also reflect the youth of the
market. Young markets tend to be more inefficient, since no one is
really sure how assets should be valued or what the future looks.
As a result, very small changes in one's initial assumptions can
lead to wild swings in price, which after all is an attempt to
discount the future. As the market ages, those swings should
moderate. I hope.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, I'd prefer it if the day traders were spending at
least some time looking at the fundamentals of the companies
they're buying. But if their approach is truly suicidal, they'll
disappear, and if it's not, then they'll only help the market's
efficiency. Wall Street, don't fear the groundlings!

HOLLYWOOD'S $17 MILLION WOMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  World rights except Great Britain and Australia 
 Color slides and black and white photos of Julia Roberts, Susan
Sarandon, Liam Aiken and Jena Malone in ``Stepmom.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    ``I don't want to be known as Hollywood's $17 million woman,''
says Julia Roberts, ``although I've been known as worse things.
 &HT;    ``I'd prefer to be known as the 'great friend woman,' 'the great
actress woman' _ or the 'nice legs woman.' Now that would be OK.''
 &HT;    Nevertheless, the 31-year-old Roberts is picking up that fat
paycheck for the film she's currently shooting _ reuniting with her
``Pretty Woman'' co-star Richard Gere and director Garry Marshall
in ``Runaway Bride.''
 &HT;    She's earning considerably less for playing the title role
opposite Susan Sarandon and Ed Harris in ``Stepmom'' (opening Dec.
25), although she and Sarandon could clean up nicely if the film
turns out to be a box office smash because they were producers on
the film.
 &HT;    In ``Stepmom,'' Sarandon plays Jackie, whose ex-husband (Harris)
has married Isabel, a vain, ambitious fashion photographer played
by Roberts. Not surprisingly neither Sarandon nor her two young
children are wild about their father's new spouse.
 &HT;    Things change, however, when Jackie learns she is dying. At
first Isabel is less than thrilled when she realizes she's
inheriting a family. She has to learn to change her priorities and
win the love and trust of the ailing Sarandon and her young
children if she is to grow into the stepmom role.
 &HT;    Roberts, looking relaxed with her hair down to her shoulders and
dressed in sweater and slacks, was in obvious good humor she showed
up at New York's Waldorf-Astoria to talk her role, which she calls
the most mature of her career.
 &HT;    Roberts, without children of her own, still found herself in
sympathy with Isabel since the character's life was much like that
of a career-driven actress.
 &HT;    ``Isabel says she never wanted to be a mom and yet finds herself
struggling to cope with being a surrogate parent--an unwanted
stepparent,'' says Roberts. ``Given her age she's more interested
in her career than stuck with a family. I can relate to that. And
it's a no-win situation because Jackie is the perfect mother and
Isabel can only come off a poor second when she tries to become a
parent.''
 &HT;    Should Roberts herself decide to become a parent, she says she
is certainly not about to become a stay-at-home.
 &HT;    ``I don't understand this one-versus-the-other business,
especially in this generation. Would any of us be here as capable
human beings if our parents didn't work? My mother always worked. I
know people talk as if this work I do would make it more difficult.
I have no children so maybe I'm talking out of the side of my head,
but it seems to me that you work for four months and then you don't
work for like nine months. That's a lot of kid time.''
 &HT;    And she's the first to admit that the kind of money her
star-wattage commands would pay for a lot of mother's helpers. Now
that she's become Hollywood's highest paid female star, however,
the actress insists getting paid big bucks is the last thing she
thinks about.
 &HT;    ``I love what I do and I'd do it for free,'' she says. ``I'm not
going to perform better if I get paid more or less. It's not pound
for pound--where you only pay for the legs or the smile or the big
hair. That's not how it works. When you're up at 4 a.m. and out in
a bikini and it's 30 degrees outside--it doesn't matter how much
they're paying you. At that moment you still think it's not
enough.''
 &HT;    Roberts says she's no longer the callow, vulnerable 20-something
star whose personal life has been chronicled to the point of
exhaustion since she first burst on the scene in ``Mystic Pizza''
(1988), ``Steel Magnolias'' (1989) and then as a star in ``Pretty
Woman'' (1990).
 &HT;    ```Stepmom' is first real-life grown-up part that deals with
real complex issues and problems I've ever done. It's about kids,
husband, job, not about makeup and wardrobe. I couldn't have done
it five years ago--it wouldn't have had the same value to me.''
 &HT;    Besides teaming up with Gere again she has just finished
``Notting Hill,'' shot in London, in which she gets to romance Hugh
Grant for writer Richard Curtis who wrote ``Four Weddings and a
Funeral.''
 &HT;    And her career is riding high again after a series of flop
movies like Woody Allen's ``Everyone Says I Love You'' (1996),
Robert Altman's ``Ready to Wear'' (1994), the horror film ``Mary
Reilly'' (1996) and ``The Conspiracy Theory'' (1997) opposite Mel
Gibson.
 &HT;    Her private life reads like a five-reeler: In l991 she broke off
her engagement with Kiefer Sutherland three days before the
wedding. In l993 she married singer Lyle Lovett but they divorced
21 months later. In between were relationships with Dylan McDermot,
Liam Neeson, Jason Patric and New York gym-owner Pat Manocchia.
 &HT;    She insists her relationship with TV actor Benjamin Bratt (``Law
and Order'') is still on despite published reports to the contrary.
But she says, ``I'm not getting married any time soon.''
 &HT;    Bratt has lasted more than a year on her arm but she still lives
alone in a New York apartment not far from her sister Lisa who is
two years older. (Roberts also has an older brother, actor Eric
Roberts.)
 &HT;    In the long-awaited reunion with Gere she plays a woman who goes
from man to man. Is the role based on her own penchant for skipping
from boyfriend to boyfriend?
 &HT;    She good naturedly handles the question: ``Of course not, '' she
says. ``The movie is fiction.''
 &HT;    But there's no doubt she's delighted to be back with her
``Pretty Woman'' star, and she adores the film's director,
Marshall.
 &HT;    ``The whole film has been a gas,'' she says. ``Garry is
fantastic and gets me to go out on a limb and do things I wouldn't
do for other directors. I know I can trust him. On `Pretty Woman'
he had me do something I was scared about. I thought I'd humiliate
myself forever but when I saw the scene in the finished movie with
an audience, people were peeing laughing.''
 &HT;    Since shooting ``Stepmom'' she has become bosom buddies with
co-star Sarandon, who has a family with actor-director Tim Robbins:
``Susan and Tim are my absolute idols,'' says Roberts. ``Some day I
would like to have the kind of career that Susan has and the kind
of relationship with a man that she has with Tim.''

'TIS THE SEASON FOR IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Is this really happening? It is. It's time to
wake up and enter the national nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, I have better things to do _ eggnog to drink, Niners to
watch and the homeless to write about.
</P>
<P>
   I haven't even finished my Christmas shopping and suddenly
impeachment looms.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us have been telling ourselves, ``It's only a dream.''
Unfortunately, we're bit players in ``Nightmare on Pennsylvania
Avenue,'' and it won't end. It will only get worse.
</P>
<P>
   If the House votes for impeachment, here are some things we have
to look forward to:
</P>
<P>
   Monica and Linda will testify under oath before the Senate.
While these tabloid stars talk about oral sex and secretly
tape-recording friends, senators will be forced to perform the
unnatural act of being silent.
</P>
<P>
   That'll be the only redeeming part of the national nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   The distinguished senators will submit written questions about
blue dresses, cigars and the definition of ``sexual relations'' to
William Rehnquist, the chief justice of the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   We can only pray that Rehnquist doesn't catch the flu and get
replaced by Clarence Thomas, keeping his whistle wet by drinking
from a can of Coke.
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC, CNN and all the other networks are designing their
impeachment logos and impeachment theme music right now. They've
already deployed their legal analysts and political pundits, and
now are hiring fashion critics for the Monica and Linda portions of
the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The networks will have full national nightmare coverage 28 hours
a day, 9 days a week, 40 days a month until it's over.
</P>
<P>
   But it will never be over, even if the right wing achieves the
goal it's had for six years, which is to put the word ``impeached''
after President Clinton's name in the World Almanac.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Clinton leaves office or not, the Republicans will try
to charge him with perjury in criminal court, take his pension away
and force him to sit in rags on a street corner with a cardboard
sign saying, ``Will apologize profusely for food.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Clinton should stop apologizing and shut up.
Words have failed him, and he has failed plain English, even basic
words like ``sex'' and ``is.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Clinton should just focus on the work of the presidency,
like keeping the Dow Jones high and ignoring weapons violations by
Iraq. He should just let the Republican Party destroy itself.
</P>
<P>
   These are radicals, not conservatives. The more isolated the
Republicans get from public opinion the more extreme they get, much
like the Weathermen in the '60s, who ended up isolated in small
rooms wondering why the public never joined them in making bombs to
overthrow the government.
</P>
<P>
   Right-wingers in Congress are just as isolated from the public,
but have a slightly better chance of overthrowing Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Then what happens? In trying to destroy a president who cares
too much about his place in history, Republicans have forgotten
about their place in history. Come the 2000 election, they may be
history.
</P>
<P>
   The craziest thing to come from the Republican loony bin in the
last couple of days is the notion that Americans will forget about
the impeachment madness by the 2000 election, and Republicans won't
pay a political price.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming said, ``The attention span
of Americans is, `Which movie is coming out next month?' and
whether the quarterly report on their stock will change.''
</P>
<P>
   This is very cynical, and perhaps true about most events. But we
have a long attention span when it comes to presidents. We may not
remember much about them, but we remember how they left office.
</P>
<P>
   The last 35 years haven't been good to presidents. Kennedy was
assassinated. Johnson decided not to run for reelection after the
Tet offensive. Nixon was driven from office in shame for dirty
political tricks. Ford pardoned Nixon, hit some people with golf
balls, and disappeared, never having been elected president. After
a hostage fiasco in Iran, Carter left to become a good
ex-president.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan served out two terms successfully, defeating the Evil
Empire. Bush? Well, shifts in public opinion happen.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton resigns, as many Republicans want, Americans will
remember. They'll remember that a political party went crazy and
ran a president out of office for such threats to the constitution
as fooling around with an intern and lying about it.
</P>
<P>
   We'll have to explain it to children for generations to come _
that is, if impeachment doesn't become a standard way of getting
rid of presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Look, I don't like Bill Clinton very much, but I don't want him
thrown out of office. He may be slippery, but his enemies are toxic
slime.
</P>
<P>
   These are people who've had ``Impeach Clinton'' bumper stickers
on their cars since January 1993, and have been looking for a
reason, finally finding her.
</P>
<P>
   No, I don't want to see Monica and Linda raising their right

three branches of government in one room talking about the
definition of ``sexual relations'' for the benefit of MSNBC.

   Pass the eggnog, not the impeachment.

   &UR; BILL'S WORLD &QC;  &LR;   &UR; By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The last impeachment trial of a president _ Andrew Johnson _
took 74 days. But back then there were fewer TV soap operas to
interrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton says we must do more for our farmers. Yes, but in
this holiday season we're already eating as much as we can.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can build a future on hope,'' Mr. Clinton told Israel on
his Middle East trip, ``that is different from the past.'' However,
it's unclear whether he can do that for himself in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a holiday TV special we bet would get a lot of viewers:
``A Very Monica Hanukkah.''
</P>
<P>
   At last count three House Democrats have said they'll vote for
impeachment. Or, as they may be known in the White House,
Damnocrats.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say how the impeachment vote will go in the House.
But you have to wonder why there's been no similar push to impeach
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been condemned by my accusers with harsh words,'' Mr.
Clinton says. And by himself with weaselly words.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better to be hated for what you are,'' says Al Gore,
``than to be loved for what you are not.'' Right, but here's our
corollary: It's even better to be hated only by nincompoops.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Kerrey of Nebraska has decided not to run for president
in 2000. So have we, but it didn't make the wires.
</P>
<P>
   Crime rates continue to fall in the country. Maybe more and more
potential criminals are waiting until they get elected to office.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OPENING REMARKS FROM THE ``LATE SHOW with DAVID LETTERMAN'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``I love New York City, it's very festive. This morning, for
example, my cab driver, bless his heart, instead of wearing a
turban, he had his head gift wrapped.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a warning for you folks if you're in town for the
holidays. There's a guy over on Eighth Avenue and he's using a blow
dryer on rats and he's selling them as Furbys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``...to kick of the holiday season, tonight, the hairpiece I'm
wearing is made from the pelt of a Furby.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting ready to do my shopping and I'm thinking, who are
we kidding? This Christmas, why don't we all quit playing around,
quit goofing around and get dad exactly what dad wants. Let's get
dad his own intern.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People who come from out of town and want to stay at a nice
hotel and want to see a Broadway show, it's very expensive. Here
now is a piece of advice, a free tip for out-of-towners when you
come to New York City. Do what I do many times, instead of wasting
all that money on a hotel and a show -- just sleep through Cats.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton's representatives now have been given 30
hours to defend him. Thirty hours? Man! You couldn't defend the
college years in 30 hours!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Love em or hate em, you've got to give these Clinton attorneys
a lot of credit. Talk about no rest for the weary. Okay, they're
done with this, now they're getting ready for his next sex
scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're considering now a fifth Article of Impeachment and
this charge is pretty serious...--'Bad taste in girlfriends.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton, of course, is still saying what he and Monica
Lewinsky did was not sex. He's also still saying that lying under
oath is not perjury.''
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton would really rather not be impeached...When
this guy gets out of office and he's walking around looking for a
job, trying to find a gig, right there on his resume it says that
he was impeached, that's bad!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, you know what's in the mail now? The White House
Christmas card. It's a wonderful piece of work, I saw one earlier.
It depicts Bill and Hillary after the impeachment and they're
moving into the stable.''

   &UR; CITY STREETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   I had arranged to meet my daughter, Tali, on Third Avenue, and
as I approached I could hear police cars screeching to the curb,
sirens blasting and red lights flashing. I spotted my daughter
rushing toward me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look Mom,'' she said, laughing and pointing across the street.
``It's a chicken!''
</P>
<P>
   To my surprise, there was a very alive, very frightened chicken,
the scrawniest creature I had ever seen. The poor chicken was
pacing back and forth on the sidewalk, undoubtedly trying to decide
whether to brave Third Avenue traffic or stay and face the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the police were facing a dilemma of their own. Once
within reach of the chicken, the officers realized they were not
sufficiently equipped to catch it.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, one of the more daring took action. Armed with an old
cardboard box grabbed from a grocery stand, he lunged at the
chicken and managed to scoop the box over it. Now things were back
at stalemate, with the chicken only temporarily confined.
</P>
<P>
   Hunger and the passing of time finally got the better of us. We
decided to leave. At last glance, the police cars were speeding
away, and three anxious police officers were guarding the box. We
passed up the chicken dishes on the lunch menu.

   Linda Blum was walking uptown on Madison Avenue on Halloween
when she was mesmerized by a dachshund ambling along on a leash.
His sides were covered by two tan oval cushions and a wavy line of
yellow felt trailed down his back. The dog's owner spotted Ms.
Blum's amused expression and explained. ``It's his Halloween
costume,'' she said. ``He's a hot dog. ''
</P>
<P>
   Requirements listed on a recent ``help wanted'' sign in a bakery
on 17th Street intrigued Norman Oder: Honest, Hard Working,
Engaging or Relatively Engaging, or Appear To Be Relatively
Engaging.
</P>
<P>
   Having spent most of my 47 years running on Manhattan's
unforgiving sidewalks, I knew to look for dogs, and often a
retractable, impossible-to-see-at-night fish-line leash attached.
</P>
<P>
   This tiny dog was under a car, sniffing a tire, not visible
until it was too late. The owner was, of course, looking in a
window, oblivious to the fact that her leash was like a trip wire
across the entire width of the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   Even before I hit the ground hard, bloodying my knees, palms and
head, she was screaming, ``Oh, my God, are you OK? Tell me you're
OK!'' At least she seemed contrite! I muttered, ``Yeah, I'm OK.''
She responded: ``Not you! Biscuit! You could have broken her
neck.''
</P>

   As a member of the Museum of Modern Art, Susan Striker was
savoring the luxury of a members-only opening of the Jackson
Pollock exhibit without being jostled by the usual crowds. She
noted that the overheard conversations were on a level above ``My
3-year-old can paint better than that,'' and that it seemed
everyone was serious about art. Then one elderly woman turned to
another and said, ``The best thing about Jackson Pollock is that
when I look at his paintings I don't see the floater in my eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, a Queens-bound N train stood at 57th Street with its
doors open. Three minutes grew to five and then 10. Finally, the
driver took to the intercom, explaining that the train was stuck
because the one ahead was experiencing ``passenger interference.''
</P>
<P>
   A short silence ensued as the well-behaved passengers digested
the information. Then one man delivered his opinion. ``Shoot him,''
he suggested. JoAnn C. Gutin noted that he got his laugh, but
another rider stepped in with something more appropriate. ``Nah,''
he said. ``Passenger interference is only a 15-yard penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Simpson was pleased when Eric, her highly active
7-year-old pupil arrived for his piano lesson and greeted her with
enthusiasm. However, she wondered whether she'd be able to hold his
attention that day _ she was going to explain how to count dotted
rhythms, a formidable concept for any child. He sat perfectly
still, eyes glued to her face. ``Oh boy,'' she thought. ``He's
taking it in. We'll be making real progress now.''
</P>
<P>
   She then asked Eric if he had any questions. There was a
thoughtful pause, and he lifted his gaze above her eye level.
Forget dotted rhythms. He had obviously been concentrating on what
he considered a less than perfect coiffure. ``Would you like me to
find you a hairbrush?'' he asked.
</P>

   Robert Gordon Mahler was in Zion National Park, Utah, standing
on the canyon floor admiring the surrounding spectacular mountains,
when a fellow tourist addressed a friend: ``This is just like New
York City. My neck hurts from looking up.''
</P>
<P>
   An amused grandmother reassured her visiting 7-year-old
granddaughter that tooth fairies were everywhere and that the two
teeth under her pillow would be taken care of. Indeed, the next
morning, the tooth fairy had left some money, and also granted the
request in the girl's note: I woold like it if I kod pleas keep my
teeth. ThankU. Love Elaine.

</P>
<P>
   ``Earlier today, President Clinton's lawyers began defending
President Clinton before the House Impeachment Committee. I'm not
sure they did much good because their main argument was, 'Come on,
she was wearing a thong.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night at the White House, President Clinton threw a
Christmas party for all 535 members of Congress. During the
festivities several congressmen told the President, 'This is great.
Now we don't have to have a going away party.'''
</P>

road he wants to get really drunk and marry her all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, one million people in San Francisco were without
power after a worker shut off a power switch. The worker apologized
for the mistake saying he didn't realize Kathie Lee's Christmas
special wasn't until Friday.''
</P>
<P>

that could reveal secrets of human origins. Then today, scientists
realized that all they had actually found was Calista Flockhart
taking a nap.''
</P>

thinking twice before opening the door these days.''

   ``This is an historic day in Washington, as the House Judiciary

<P>
   ``So (the House) is getting close to actual impeachment. This is
the biggest overreaction since Joe Pesci shot Spider in
'Goodfellas.' This is the most excessive penalty since Jean Valjean

that is severe.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton has now said if the House agrees to censure

   ``Democratic Counsel Abbe Lowell used video tape to enhance his

   ``I love New York City, it's very festive. This morning, for
example, my cab driver, bless his heart, instead of wearing a
turban, he had his head gift wrapped.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a warning for you folks if you're in town for the
holidays. There's a guy over on Eighth Avenue and he's using a blow
dryer on rats and he's selling them as Furbys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``...to kick of the holiday season, tonight, the hairpiece I'm
wearing is made from the pelt of a Furby.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting ready to do my shopping and I'm thinking, who are
we kidding? This Christmas, why don't we all quit playing around,
quit goofing around and get dad exactly what dad wants. Let's get
dad his own intern.''

   ``People who come from out of town and want to stay at a nice
hotel and want to see a Broadway show, it's very expensive. Here
now is a piece of advice, a free tip for out-of-towners when you
come to New York City. Do what I do many times, instead of wasting
all that money on a hotel and a show -- just sleep through Cats.'''

   ``President Clinton's representatives now have been given 30
hours to defend him. Thirty hours? Man! You couldn't defend the
college years in 30 hours!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Love em or hate em, you've got to give these Clinton attorneys
a lot of credit. Talk about no rest for the weary. Okay, they're
done with this, now they're getting ready for his next sex
scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're considering now a fifth Article of Impeachment and
this charge is pretty serious...--'Bad taste in girlfriends.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton, of course, is still saying what he and Monica
Lewinsky did was not sex. He's also still saying that lying under
oath is not perjury.''

<P>
   ``President Clinton would really rather not be impeached...When
this guy gets out of office and he's walking around looking for a
job, trying to find a gig, right there on his resume it says that
he was impeached, that's bad!''

<P>
   ``Hey, you know what's in the mail now? The White House
Christmas card. It's a wonderful piece of work, I saw one earlier.
It depicts Bill and Hillary after the impeachment and they're
moving into the stable.''

<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT: A YEAR IN REVIEW -- Available after 2 p.m.
Thursday -- There was plenty to ponder, mock, praise and puncture
in the arts in 1998. From movies to pop music to a television
season where it was hard to tell whether you were watching ``Jerry
Springer'' or ``Meet the Press,'' it's always fun to recall the
highlights and low lights from the 12 months gone by. WITH: RINGEL
ON VIDEO -- The movies of Christmas are as familiar as our favorite
tree ornaments; but sometimes you want something a little less
obvious, a little less traditional.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS -- Available after 2 p.m. Friday -- The Panama Canal is
more than an engineering wonder of the world, it is a symbol of the
ingenuity and determination of the United States. At high noon on
Dec. 31, 1999, under terms of the 1977 treaty negotiated by
then-President Carter, the Panama Canal will become the sole
property of Panama. Many in Washington have called for a continued
U.S. military presence in Panama after 2000. But Panama recently
slammed the door on negotiations to allow either a U.S. presence or
the installation of a proposed anti-narcotics center. WITH: CANAL
HISTORY -- A brief history of the Panama Canal.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL -- Christmas -- especially the weekend of Grand
Illumination, always the first Sunday in December -- is the busiest
time of the year in Colonial Williamsburg; and there's no mystery
as to why. There are few seasonal destinations more magnificent
than the 500 restored or re-created public buildings, houses,
taverns and trade shops brilliantly decorated for the holidays.
WITH: TRAVEL NOTES -- One thing you can almost count on when you
revisit Walt Disney World is that something new and nifty will have
sprung up. A summary of what's ahead or has just arrived at the
ever-expanding Florida resort. WITH: TRAVEL BRIEFS -- Next year
will bring less variety among U.S. airlines' frequent-flier
programs and the disappearance of miles that expire, an expert on
loyalty programs predicts.
</P>
<P>
   FOOD - SOUP -- The power of soup is more than folklore. Think
about the healing taste of chicken soup, the camaraderie of sharing
a pot of chili on a cold winter afternoon, even the souped-up
recipe enhancements of the ubiquitous canned cream of mushroom.
Comforting stuff, soup. Comforting for the cook, too. After the
rigors of preparing a multi-course Thanksgiving dinner, there's
something seductively simple about just fixing soup. WITH: SOUP
RECIPES WITH: CYBERSPICE -- A number of sites on the Internet offer
innovative possibilities for gifts of food.
</P>
<P>
   WHEELS -- SAAB -- Not content with turning its 5-year-old 900
models into the frisky 9-3 coupe and sedan for 1999, Saab moves in
the automotive race toward the millennium with mid-model-year '99?
versions. It's not just a marketing or public relations ploy,
either. Saab has made significant changes -- mostly underneath and
inside -- to the front-drive cars. WITH: SHARP DRIVING -- This
holiday season, Volvo is one of several automakers, including BMW,
Mercedes-Benz and Saab, that are offering European delivery.
</P>
<P>
   PERSONAL TECHNOLOGY -DVD -- Remember the day you walked into the
record store and there weren't any records? Don't be surprised 10
years from now if you walk into a video store and there aren't any
videotapes. Digital video discs, commonly known as DVDs, are
gaining a foothold by outperforming VCRs the way CDs outperformed
vinyl records. WITH: DVD COMPUTERS -- In addition to its
development as a home-theater component, DVD is expected to be an
important force in personal computers. WITH: DIGITAL DIVIDE: While
many high-tech companies continue to spend hundreds of millions of
dollars to supercharge the connection between education and
technology, the larger companies have a new focus -- on the
teacher. WITH: TECH BRIEFS -- Swatch, the company that made the
plastic watch cool, has launched a cool new line of plastic pagers.
The beeper comes in three colors: airmail blue, black grape and
round table orange. WITH: TECHNOBUDDY -- Telecommuting is fine for
performing many work-related tasks; but it can never be a real
substitute for actually being there.
</P>
<P>
   BOOKS -- JORDAN -- Long before fretting about ``moral
authority'' in public life became a national pastime, people sensed
that Barbara Jordan symbolized the quality. As Mary Beth Rogers,
her latest biographer, notes, she spoke with the authority of an
Old Testament prophet, using her stirring deep voice, impeccable
diction and studied reasoning to electric effect. WITH: NEWS TEAM
-- MacNeil and Lehrer are together again, this time on bookshelves
rather than on television. For almost 15 years, Robert MacNeil and
Jim Lehrer co-anchored PBS' hourlong evening newscast. MacNeil left
in 1996, primarily to write, and Lehrer soldiers on alone. These
two genteel journalists have published new novels simultaneously,
and while neither is going to prompt Updike or Roth to check his
heels to see who's nipping there, both are brisk, engaging reads.
WITH: ON THE SHELF -- Gift books represent a special category of
Christmas present -- each requires a sizable cash or credit
investment and a full sheet of wrapping paper, not to mention a
strong back if you plan to buy more than one or two. Here's a list
of books you may consider giving as presents this holiday season.
WITH: N.Y. TIMES BEST SELLERS LIST
</P>
<P>
   SCIENCE &AMP; HEALTH -- BACK TO MARS -- NASA, seeking more clues
about whether Mars might once have supported primitive life, is
embarking on a new chapter in its Martian Chronicles. Over the few
weeks, the space agency is taking advantage of the favorable
alignment of Earth and Mars to launch two spacecraft to the Red
Planet. They are the latest in a decade-long series of planned
missions that began with last year's successful landing of the
Pathfinder spacecraft and its robot rover Sojourner. WITH HEALTH
CARE -- Eyeglasses often make it on the list of holiday purchases
-- not as presents, but as a way for patients to squeeze out the
last dollars of their yearly health benefits. WITH: HEALTH BRIEFS
-- Concerned about the danger of Web sites that offer Viagra
prescriptions without any face-to-face doctor-patient contact,
Florida officials say doctors who prescribe the drug online could
face criminal prosecution or board discipline. WITH: IN SCIENCE --
Newly discovered records of bones found in 1940 on a remote island
in the South Pacific indicate that the remains might have been
those of aviator Amelia Earhart.

</P>
<P>
   I had arranged to meet my daughter, Tali, on Third Avenue, and
as I approached I could hear police cars screeching to the curb,
sirens blasting and red lights flashing. I spotted my daughter
rushing toward me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look Mom,'' she said, laughing and pointing across the street.
``It's a chicken!''
</P>
<P>
   To my surprise, there was a very alive, very frightened chicken,
the scrawniest creature I had ever seen. The poor chicken was
pacing back and forth on the sidewalk, undoubtedly trying to decide
whether to brave Third Avenue traffic or stay and face the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the police were facing a dilemma of their own. Once
within reach of the chicken, the officers realized they were not
sufficiently equipped to catch it.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, one of the more daring took action. Armed with an old
cardboard box grabbed from a grocery stand, he lunged at the
chicken and managed to scoop the box over it. Now things were back
at stalemate, with the chicken only temporarily confined.
</P>
<P>
   Hunger and the passing of time finally got the better of us. We
decided to leave. At last glance, the police cars were speeding
away, and three anxious police officers were guarding the box. We
passed up the chicken dishes on the lunch menu.

   Linda Blum was walking uptown on Madison Avenue on Halloween
when she was mesmerized by a dachshund ambling along on a leash.
His sides were covered by two tan oval cushions and a wavy line of
yellow felt trailed down his back. The dog's owner spotted Ms.
Blum's amused expression and explained. ``It's his Halloween
costume,'' she said. ``He's a hot dog. ''

   Requirements listed on a recent ``help wanted'' sign in a bakery

<P>
   Having spent most of my 47 years running on Manhattan's
unforgiving sidewalks, I knew to look for dogs, and often a
retractable, impossible-to-see-at-night fish-line leash attached.
</P>
<P>
   This tiny dog was under a car, sniffing a tire, not visible
until it was too late. The owner was, of course, looking in a
window, oblivious to the fact that her leash was like a trip wire
across the entire width of the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   Even before I hit the ground hard, bloodying my knees, palms and
head, she was screaming, ``Oh, my God, are you OK? Tell me you're
OK!'' At least she seemed contrite! I muttered, ``Yeah, I'm OK.''
She responded: ``Not you! Biscuit! You could have broken her
neck.''

   As a member of the Museum of Modern Art, Susan Striker was
savoring the luxury of a members-only opening of the Jackson
Pollock exhibit without being jostled by the usual crowds. She
noted that the overheard conversations were on a level above ``My
3-year-old can paint better than that,'' and that it seemed
everyone was serious about art. Then one elderly woman turned to
another and said, ``The best thing about Jackson Pollock is that
when I look at his paintings I don't see the floater in my eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, a Queens-bound N train stood at 57th Street with its
doors open. Three minutes grew to five and then 10. Finally, the
driver took to the intercom, explaining that the train was stuck
because the one ahead was experiencing ``passenger interference.''
</P>
<P>
   A short silence ensued as the well-behaved passengers digested
the information. Then one man delivered his opinion. ``Shoot him,''
he suggested. JoAnn C. Gutin noted that he got his laugh, but
another rider stepped in with something more appropriate. ``Nah,''
he said. ``Passenger interference is only a 15-yard penalty.''
</P>

   Sheila Simpson was pleased when Eric, her highly active
7-year-old pupil arrived for his piano lesson and greeted her with
enthusiasm. However, she wondered whether she'd be able to hold his
attention that day _ she was going to explain how to count dotted
rhythms, a formidable concept for any child. He sat perfectly
still, eyes glued to her face. ``Oh boy,'' she thought. ``He's
taking it in. We'll be making real progress now.''
</P>
<P>
   She then asked Eric if he had any questions. There was a
thoughtful pause, and he lifted his gaze above her eye level.
Forget dotted rhythms. He had obviously been concentrating on what
he considered a less than perfect coiffure. ``Would you like me to
find you a hairbrush?'' he asked.

   Robert Gordon Mahler was in Zion National Park, Utah, standing
on the canyon floor admiring the surrounding spectacular mountains,
when a fellow tourist addressed a friend: ``This is just like New
York City. My neck hurts from looking up.''
</P>
<P>
   An amused grandmother reassured her visiting 7-year-old
granddaughter that tooth fairies were everywhere and that the two
teeth under her pillow would be taken care of. Indeed, the next
morning, the tooth fairy had left some money, and also granted the
request in the girl's note: I woold like it if I kod pleas keep my
teeth. ThankU. Love Elaine.

   ``Earlier today, President Clinton's lawyers began defending
President Clinton before the House Impeachment Committee. I'm not
sure they did much good because their main argument was, 'Come on,
she was wearing a thong.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night at the White House, President Clinton threw a
Christmas party for all 535 members of Congress. During the
festivities several congressmen told the President, 'This is great.
Now we don't have to have a going away party.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``According to a new survey, 46 percent of Americans say they're
tired of all the focus on gifts and commercialism during the
holidays. The other 54 percent are selling Furbies for $300 each.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis Rodman filed for an annulment from Carmen Electra only
nine days after he got married, but now he says he hopes the
marriage will work out. In fact, he said that some day down the
road he wants to get really drunk and marry her all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, one million people in San Francisco were without
power after a worker shut off a power switch. The worker apologized
for the mistake saying he didn't realize Kathie Lee's Christmas
special wasn't until Friday.''

   ``Yesterday, scientists announced they discovered a skeleton
that could reveal secrets of human origins. Then today, scientists
realized that all they had actually found was Calista Flockhart
taking a nap.''

   ``This week Hillary Clinton attended a movie premiere and she
said she hasn't been in a movie theater for years. Meanwhile,
President Clinton said he hasn't been in a movie theater since they
cleaned up Times Square.''

   ``Yesterday, President Clinton's defense team rested after a

   ``This is an historic day in Washington, as the House Judiciary

right now: Earlier today, Elton John began re-writing 'Candle in
the Wind' for him.''

that is severe.'''

   &UR; BILL'S WORLD &QC;  &LR;   &UR; By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The last impeachment trial of a president _ Andrew Johnson _
took 74 days. But back then there were fewer TV soap operas to
interrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton says we must do more for our farmers. Yes, but in
this holiday season we're already eating as much as we can.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can build a future on hope,'' Mr. Clinton told Israel on
his Middle East trip, ``that is different from the past.'' However,
it's unclear whether he can do that for himself in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a holiday TV special we bet would get a lot of viewers:
``A Very Monica Hanukkah.''
</P>
<P>
   At last count three House Democrats have said they'll vote for
impeachment. Or, as they may be known in the White House,
Damnocrats.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say how the impeachment vote will go in the House.
But you have to wonder why there's been no similar push to impeach
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been condemned by my accusers with harsh words,'' Mr.
Clinton says. And by himself with weaselly words.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better to be hated for what you are,'' says Al Gore,
``than to be loved for what you are not.'' Right, but here's our
corollary: It's even better to be hated only by nincompoops.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Kerrey of Nebraska has decided not to run for president
in 2000. So have we, but it didn't make the wires.
</P>
<P>
   Crime rates continue to fall in the country. Maybe more and more
potential criminals are waiting until they get elected to office.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OPENING REMARKS FROM THE ``LATE SHOW with DAVID LETTERMAN'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``I love New York City, it's very festive. This morning, for
example, my cab driver, bless his heart, instead of wearing a
turban, he had his head gift wrapped.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a warning for you folks if you're in town for the
holidays. There's a guy over on Eighth Avenue and he's using a blow
dryer on rats and he's selling them as Furbys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``...to kick of the holiday season, tonight, the hairpiece I'm
wearing is made from the pelt of a Furby.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting ready to do my shopping and I'm thinking, who are
we kidding? This Christmas, why don't we all quit playing around,
quit goofing around and get dad exactly what dad wants. Let's get
dad his own intern.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People who come from out of town and want to stay at a nice
hotel and want to see a Broadway show, it's very expensive. Here
now is a piece of advice, a free tip for out-of-towners when you
come to New York City. Do what I do many times, instead of wasting
all that money on a hotel and a show -- just sleep through Cats.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton's representatives now have been given 30
hours to defend him. Thirty hours? Man! You couldn't defend the
college years in 30 hours!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Love em or hate em, you've got to give these Clinton attorneys
a lot of credit. Talk about no rest for the weary. Okay, they're
done with this, now they're getting ready for his next sex
scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're considering now a fifth Article of Impeachment and
this charge is pretty serious...--'Bad taste in girlfriends.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton, of course, is still saying what he and Monica
Lewinsky did was not sex. He's also still saying that lying under
oath is not perjury.''
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton would really rather not be impeached...When
this guy gets out of office and he's walking around looking for a
job, trying to find a gig, right there on his resume it says that
he was impeached, that's bad!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, you know what's in the mail now? The White House
Christmas card. It's a wonderful piece of work, I saw one earlier.
It depicts Bill and Hillary after the impeachment and they're
moving into the stable.''

   &UR; CITY STREETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   I had arranged to meet my daughter, Tali, on Third Avenue, and
as I approached I could hear police cars screeching to the curb,
sirens blasting and red lights flashing. I spotted my daughter
rushing toward me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look Mom,'' she said, laughing and pointing across the street.
``It's a chicken!''
</P>
<P>
   To my surprise, there was a very alive, very frightened chicken,
the scrawniest creature I had ever seen. The poor chicken was
pacing back and forth on the sidewalk, undoubtedly trying to decide
whether to brave Third Avenue traffic or stay and face the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the police were facing a dilemma of their own. Once
within reach of the chicken, the officers realized they were not
sufficiently equipped to catch it.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, one of the more daring took action. Armed with an old
cardboard box grabbed from a grocery stand, he lunged at the
chicken and managed to scoop the box over it. Now things were back
at stalemate, with the chicken only temporarily confined.
</P>
<P>
   Hunger and the passing of time finally got the better of us. We
decided to leave. At last glance, the police cars were speeding
away, and three anxious police officers were guarding the box. We
passed up the chicken dishes on the lunch menu.

   Linda Blum was walking uptown on Madison Avenue on Halloween
when she was mesmerized by a dachshund ambling along on a leash.
His sides were covered by two tan oval cushions and a wavy line of
yellow felt trailed down his back. The dog's owner spotted Ms.
Blum's amused expression and explained. ``It's his Halloween
costume,'' she said. ``He's a hot dog. ''

   Having spent most of my 47 years running on Manhattan's
unforgiving sidewalks, I knew to look for dogs, and often a
retractable, impossible-to-see-at-night fish-line leash attached.
</P>
<P>
   This tiny dog was under a car, sniffing a tire, not visible
until it was too late. The owner was, of course, looking in a
window, oblivious to the fact that her leash was like a trip wire
across the entire width of the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   Even before I hit the ground hard, bloodying my knees, palms and
head, she was screaming, ``Oh, my God, are you OK? Tell me you're
OK!'' At least she seemed contrite! I muttered, ``Yeah, I'm OK.''
She responded: ``Not you! Biscuit! You could have broken her
neck.''

   As a member of the Museum of Modern Art, Susan Striker was
savoring the luxury of a members-only opening of the Jackson
Pollock exhibit without being jostled by the usual crowds. She
noted that the overheard conversations were on a level above ``My
3-year-old can paint better than that,'' and that it seemed
everyone was serious about art. Then one elderly woman turned to
another and said, ``The best thing about Jackson Pollock is that
when I look at his paintings I don't see the floater in my eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, a Queens-bound N train stood at 57th Street with its
doors open. Three minutes grew to five and then 10. Finally, the
driver took to the intercom, explaining that the train was stuck
because the one ahead was experiencing ``passenger interference.''
</P>
<P>
   A short silence ensued as the well-behaved passengers digested
the information. Then one man delivered his opinion. ``Shoot him,''
he suggested. JoAnn C. Gutin noted that he got his laugh, but
another rider stepped in with something more appropriate. ``Nah,''
he said. ``Passenger interference is only a 15-yard penalty.''
</P>

   Sheila Simpson was pleased when Eric, her highly active
7-year-old pupil arrived for his piano lesson and greeted her with
enthusiasm. However, she wondered whether she'd be able to hold his
attention that day _ she was going to explain how to count dotted
rhythms, a formidable concept for any child. He sat perfectly
still, eyes glued to her face. ``Oh boy,'' she thought. ``He's
taking it in. We'll be making real progress now.''
</P>
<P>
   She then asked Eric if he had any questions. There was a
thoughtful pause, and he lifted his gaze above her eye level.
Forget dotted rhythms. He had obviously been concentrating on what
he considered a less than perfect coiffure. ``Would you like me to
find you a hairbrush?'' he asked.

   Robert Gordon Mahler was in Zion National Park, Utah, standing

   An amused grandmother reassured her visiting 7-year-old
granddaughter that tooth fairies were everywhere and that the two
teeth under her pillow would be taken care of. Indeed, the next
morning, the tooth fairy had left some money, and also granted the
request in the girl's note: I woold like it if I kod pleas keep my
teeth. ThankU. Love Elaine.

   ``Last night at the White House, President Clinton threw a
Christmas party for all 535 members of Congress. During the

   ``Dennis Rodman filed for an annulment from Carmen Electra only

   &UR; BILL'S WORLD &QC;  &LR;   &UR; By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The last impeachment trial of a president _ Andrew Johnson _
took 74 days. But back then there were fewer TV soap operas to
interrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton says we must do more for our farmers. Yes, but in
this holiday season we're already eating as much as we can.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can build a future on hope,'' Mr. Clinton told Israel on
his Middle East trip, ``that is different from the past.'' However,
it's unclear whether he can do that for himself in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a holiday TV special we bet would get a lot of viewers:
``A Very Monica Hanukkah.''
</P>
<P>
   At last count three House Democrats have said they'll vote for
impeachment. Or, as they may be known in the White House,
Damnocrats.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say how the impeachment vote will go in the House.
But you have to wonder why there's been no similar push to impeach
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been condemned by my accusers with harsh words,'' Mr.
Clinton says. And by himself with weaselly words.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better to be hated for what you are,'' says Al Gore,
``than to be loved for what you are not.'' Right, but here's our
corollary: It's even better to be hated only by nincompoops.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Kerrey of Nebraska has decided not to run for president
in 2000. So have we, but it didn't make the wires.
</P>
<P>
   Crime rates continue to fall in the country. Maybe more and more
potential criminals are waiting until they get elected to office.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OPENING REMARKS FROM THE ``LATE SHOW with DAVID LETTERMAN'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``I love New York City, it's very festive. This morning, for
example, my cab driver, bless his heart, instead of wearing a
turban, he had his head gift wrapped.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a warning for you folks if you're in town for the
holidays. There's a guy over on Eighth Avenue and he's using a blow
dryer on rats and he's selling them as Furbys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``...to kick of the holiday season, tonight, the hairpiece I'm
wearing is made from the pelt of a Furby.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting ready to do my shopping and I'm thinking, who are
we kidding? This Christmas, why don't we all quit playing around,
quit goofing around and get dad exactly what dad wants. Let's get
dad his own intern.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People who come from out of town and want to stay at a nice
hotel and want to see a Broadway show, it's very expensive. Here
now is a piece of advice, a free tip for out-of-towners when you
come to New York City. Do what I do many times, instead of wasting
all that money on a hotel and a show -- just sleep through Cats.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton's representatives now have been given 30
hours to defend him. Thirty hours? Man! You couldn't defend the
college years in 30 hours!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Love em or hate em, you've got to give these Clinton attorneys
a lot of credit. Talk about no rest for the weary. Okay, they're
done with this, now they're getting ready for his next sex
scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're considering now a fifth Article of Impeachment and
this charge is pretty serious...--'Bad taste in girlfriends.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton, of course, is still saying what he and Monica
Lewinsky did was not sex. He's also still saying that lying under
oath is not perjury.''
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton would really rather not be impeached...When
this guy gets out of office and he's walking around looking for a
job, trying to find a gig, right there on his resume it says that
he was impeached, that's bad!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, you know what's in the mail now? The White House
Christmas card. It's a wonderful piece of work, I saw one earlier.
It depicts Bill and Hillary after the impeachment and they're
moving into the stable.''

   &UR; CITY STREETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   I had arranged to meet my daughter, Tali, on Third Avenue, and
as I approached I could hear police cars screeching to the curb,
sirens blasting and red lights flashing. I spotted my daughter
rushing toward me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look Mom,'' she said, laughing and pointing across the street.
``It's a chicken!''
</P>
<P>
   To my surprise, there was a very alive, very frightened chicken,
the scrawniest creature I had ever seen. The poor chicken was
pacing back and forth on the sidewalk, undoubtedly trying to decide
whether to brave Third Avenue traffic or stay and face the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the police were facing a dilemma of their own. Once
within reach of the chicken, the officers realized they were not
sufficiently equipped to catch it.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, one of the more daring took action. Armed with an old
cardboard box grabbed from a grocery stand, he lunged at the
chicken and managed to scoop the box over it. Now things were back
at stalemate, with the chicken only temporarily confined.
</P>
<P>
   Hunger and the passing of time finally got the better of us. We
decided to leave. At last glance, the police cars were speeding
away, and three anxious police officers were guarding the box. We
passed up the chicken dishes on the lunch menu.

   Linda Blum was walking uptown on Madison Avenue on Halloween
when she was mesmerized by a dachshund ambling along on a leash.
His sides were covered by two tan oval cushions and a wavy line of
yellow felt trailed down his back. The dog's owner spotted Ms.
Blum's amused expression and explained. ``It's his Halloween
costume,'' she said. ``He's a hot dog. ''

   Requirements listed on a recent ``help wanted'' sign in a bakery

   Having spent most of my 47 years running on Manhattan's
unforgiving sidewalks, I knew to look for dogs, and often a
retractable, impossible-to-see-at-night fish-line leash attached.
</P>
<P>
   This tiny dog was under a car, sniffing a tire, not visible
until it was too late. The owner was, of course, looking in a
window, oblivious to the fact that her leash was like a trip wire
across the entire width of the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   Even before I hit the ground hard, bloodying my knees, palms and
head, she was screaming, ``Oh, my God, are you OK? Tell me you're
OK!'' At least she seemed contrite! I muttered, ``Yeah, I'm OK.''
She responded: ``Not you! Biscuit! You could have broken her
neck.''

   As a member of the Museum of Modern Art, Susan Striker was
savoring the luxury of a members-only opening of the Jackson
Pollock exhibit without being jostled by the usual crowds. She
noted that the overheard conversations were on a level above ``My
3-year-old can paint better than that,'' and that it seemed
everyone was serious about art. Then one elderly woman turned to
another and said, ``The best thing about Jackson Pollock is that
when I look at his paintings I don't see the floater in my eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, a Queens-bound N train stood at 57th Street with its
doors open. Three minutes grew to five and then 10. Finally, the
driver took to the intercom, explaining that the train was stuck
because the one ahead was experiencing ``passenger interference.''
</P>
<P>
   A short silence ensued as the well-behaved passengers digested
the information. Then one man delivered his opinion. ``Shoot him,''
he suggested. JoAnn C. Gutin noted that he got his laugh, but
another rider stepped in with something more appropriate. ``Nah,''
he said. ``Passenger interference is only a 15-yard penalty.''

   Sheila Simpson was pleased when Eric, her highly active
7-year-old pupil arrived for his piano lesson and greeted her with
enthusiasm. However, she wondered whether she'd be able to hold his
attention that day _ she was going to explain how to count dotted
rhythms, a formidable concept for any child. He sat perfectly
still, eyes glued to her face. ``Oh boy,'' she thought. ``He's
taking it in. We'll be making real progress now.''
</P>
<P>
   She then asked Eric if he had any questions. There was a
thoughtful pause, and he lifted his gaze above her eye level.
Forget dotted rhythms. He had obviously been concentrating on what
he considered a less than perfect coiffure. ``Would you like me to
find you a hairbrush?'' he asked.

   Robert Gordon Mahler was in Zion National Park, Utah, standing
on the canyon floor admiring the surrounding spectacular mountains,
when a fellow tourist addressed a friend: ``This is just like New
York City. My neck hurts from looking up.''
</P>
<P>
   An amused grandmother reassured her visiting 7-year-old
granddaughter that tooth fairies were everywhere and that the two
teeth under her pillow would be taken care of. Indeed, the next
morning, the tooth fairy had left some money, and also granted the
request in the girl's note: I woold like it if I kod pleas keep my
teeth. ThankU. Love Elaine.

BOOKS, BOTTLES AND OTHER OFFERINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Writing about wine gifts is like preaching to the converted.
Anyone who loves wine knows what an endless fount of inspiration it
can be _ anything from a single bottle to a full set of glasses can
be gift-wrapped with the certainty that it will be put to good use.
</P>
<P>
   It is the wine-fearing who don't realize that a simple, elegant
answer to their gift-giving problems is as close as the nearest
good liquor store. Wine is a welcome gift in just about any price
range, from a couple of bottles of Beaujolais nouveau for around
$10 to a case of 1995 Bordeaux for more than $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   A case of the great 1995 Robert Mondavi Reserve Cabernet
Sauvignon is just less than $1,000, but a couple of bottles of the
same wine at around $165 is still a superb gift.
</P>
<P>
   The best gift is one you know the recipient would never buy for
herself, like a fine vintage port. A Taylor 1983, about $150, or a
Graham 1977 for $125, or a Taylor from the legendary 1963 vintage
at $350 would make an unforgettable gift.
</P>
<P>
   My choice would be an old tawny, say the 26-year-old Colheita
from the Quinta do Noval at about $60, or Taylor 40-year-old for
$110.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, older rarities turn up in wine shops.
Trefethen Vineyards in the Napa Valley recently released some of
its 1992 cabernet sauvignon at about $40 a bottle. The extra three
or four years it spent in the cellars made a difference, one very
few people will get a chance to appreciate, unless they get it as a
gift.
</P>
<P>
   Most good shops will keep some older Bordeaux on hand that can
make a generous gift. A single bottle of the famous St.-Emilion,
Chateau Figeac, from the great 1982 vintage can be found in a few
shops for less than $250. Chateau Latour from the same year goes
for $800. Personally, I would love to get a few bottles from 1988
or 1989, great years at approachable prices.
</P>
<P>
   Other California labels bound to excite wine fans include
Pahlmeyer Vineyards Red, at about $65, and Christian Moueix's
Dominus, $100, both from the 1995 vintage, and Francis Ford
Coppola's Rubicon, 1992, at $50. Joseph Phelps' Insignia, 1995,
$70, is one of the great California classics.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to get dramatic, buy a big bottle, and I mean really
big. A six-liter bottle is the equivalent of eight regular
750-milliliter bottles, and often it can be an excellent value.
</P>
<P>
   Zachy's Wine and Liquor in Scarsdale, N.Y., specializes in big
bottles, but most good shops have some on hand. A six-liter bottle
of 1995 Chateau Gloria sells for about $350. The 1995 Chateau
Meyney in that size is about $300, and Chateau Larose Trintaudon is
$200.
</P>
<P>
   With Champagne, a magnum _ a double bottle _ is impressive. A
magnum of Dom Perignon 1990, the essence of luxury, is less than
$250. Other excellent Champagnes in magnums, like Nicolas
Feuillatte and Perrier-Jouet, are $50 to $60.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them also come in handsome wooden boxes, but remember,
the packaging does nothing for the wine but push up the price.
Champagne makers have a weakness for overpriced satin-lined boxes,
most of them made of cardboard, that pair their wine with a couple
of glasses. Who needs only two glasses? If you want to send wine,
send wine; if you want to send glasses, send glasses. Combining the
two is a waste of money.
</P>
<P>
   Glasses on their own, however, are a great gift. The best can
cost more than $100 each, but good ones can be found for less than
$10. Try not to give fewer than six and consider what kind of
glasses your friends prefer before you buy. Glasses are like
silverware; they may have a pattern they prefer.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't afford Baccarat, then Riedel glasses, particularly
the Vinum line, are good values at $15 to $20 each. The Riedel
Overture line, also of very good quality, sells for about $8 a
glass and is shipped in sets of 12.
</P>
<P>
   For wine wannabes, think of books and classes. One of the
longest running wine courses in New York is Kevin Zraly's school in
the sky at Windows on the World at the World Trade Center, which
has turned out some 9,000 graduates over 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-session course is $695. Zraly undercuts himself to
some extent with his book, ``Windows on the World Complete Wine
Course'' (Sterling Publishing, $25), which he updates every year.
It is one of the best wine primers available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wine for Dummies,'' an instant success several years ago and
still a big seller, has spawned a shameless imitator, ``The
Complete Idiot's Guide to Wine.'' Dummy or idiot, it comes down to
your own level of self-esteem, or how you feel about the person
who's getting the book But these do seem to help the complete
novice.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when asked about wine courses and how-to books, the late
Alexis Lichine used to say, ``There is no substitute for pulling
corks.'' In other words, spend the money on wine. I won't go that
far, but I do prefer to read wine books more for fun than
instruction. Some books offer both, and among those I prefer the
older vintages.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Johnson's ``World Atlas of Wine'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $50),
``Wine Atlas of California'' by James Halliday (Viking, $50), ``The
Great Domaines of Burgundy'' by Remington Norman's (Henry Holt,
$45), and Clive Coates' monumental ``Cote d'Or'' (University of
California, $55), are all in this category. Don't let words like
atlas and monumental put you off: These are beautiful books, filled
with information, and they are also fun to read.

A GALLO CHARDONNAY DISPLAYS ITS INTENSITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marcelina Vineyards Chardonnay 1996, Napa Valley. About $19. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Surprise, surprise. This excellent chardonnay is a Gallo wine.
It is part of the giant winery's concerted effort to become a
player in California's fine wine business, and it is an unqualified
success.
</P>
<P>
   This is a classic North Coast chardonnay, full bodied and
intense, with 14.3 percent alcohol. It has a sizable oak presence,
not unexpected in a wine fermented almost entirely in new French
oak barrels.
</P>
<P>
   About 85 percent of the grapes are from Gallo's Marcelina
Vineyards in the Napa Valley, the rest from Dry Creek Valley and
the Russian River Valley in Sonoma.
</P>
<P>
   The wine's intensity is traced to the short grape crop in 1996,
which led to lower yields that usually produce intensely flavored
fruit. The wine was made from free-run juice, which means it was
lightly pressed to minimize tannins.
</P>
<P>
   To emphasize its softer finish, the wine underwent a second, or
malolactic, fermentation. It was aged 11 months before release.

 &HT;    PASTOR AND CLINTON FRIEND GIVES PRESIDENT, FIRST LADY SUPPORT IN
ISRAEL VISIT
 &HT;    With MIDEAST-CLINTON-1216.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHLEHEM, West Bank _ While several hundred Palestinians
waiting outside Tuesday wondered why President Bill Clinton spent
an hour inside the Church of the Nativity, Clinton's old friend
says he knows.
</P>
<P>
   The cavernous church is over 1,600 years old, with several
chapels inside and a dim grotto below with a shrine over the
supposed spot of Christ's birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know just from his heart he would want to spend time there
and pray,'' said the Rev. John Anthony, who lives in Israel but
went to kindergarten and first grade with Clinton in Hope, Ark.
``With so much bombarding them and so many questions from everybody
around him, I think he needed some quiet time.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony was not with the Clintons during their visit to the
church on Tuesday. Clinton, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and
daughter Chelsea made it a side trip during their three-day visit
to the Middle East. They went through the Door of Humility, so
called because one must bend over to pass through and, presumably,
because even a president of the United States is not the most
important person to ever have been here.
</P>
<P>
   After they emerged, the three looked happy and sang Christmas
carols with a Palestinian choir.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony was not with them, but he said he knows they consider
the church important.
</P>
<P>
   Two days earlier, he greeted Clinton along with the line of
Israeli dignitaries at Israel's Ben-Gurion International Airport.
Clinton smiled broadly and gave his buddy a big hug, all captured
on Israeli television.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Anthony is using his moment of fame, having been
interviewed by several Israeli media, to ask Americans to pray for,
rather than impeach, their president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though he did sin . . . we need to forgive him and more,''
Anthony said. ``Pray for the man and look at the good things he's
done. We are all fallible, flawed people.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Anthony lived just two streets from each other as
children and they have kept in touch.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony, 52, has been a minister in Israel for 25 years. He last
saw Clinton in 1994, when the president invited him to attend the
signing of the Israel-Jordan peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. House is expected to vote as early as Thursday on
whether to impeach Clinton for his cover-up of an affair with a
White House intern. That made Anthony especially eager to show
support for his old friend at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton could not attend his Jerusalem Baptist Church service
Sunday morning -- Sundays are work days in Israel and Clinton had
to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu -- but
Clinton invited him to the VIP table at a large dinner that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about Arkansas and I told him we were praying for
them. Hillary really appreciated that and said prayers are what
have sustained them,'' Anthony said.
</P>
<P>
   Even amid Clinton's efforts to jump-start the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process, he has been dogged by the issue
of the impeachment. At times Clinton has looked tired and glum, and
people have wondered how he and the first lady are getting along.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are holding up very well,'' Anthony said of the
couple. ``They do not seem at all distant.''

IT'S TIME TO LEARN THIS YEAR'S LESSONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PAMELA YIP 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As we approach the end of the year, the evaluation of your
investment portfolio is more important than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The rise, fall and rebound of the stock market this year has
taught a harsh lesson in investment management to professional
money managers and individual investors.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you who thought you should have diversified your
portfolio before this summer's market swoon, now's your chance.
</P>
<P>
   Consider taking some money out of stocks and putting it in bonds
and cash investments such as money market mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   True, the market has come back from its severe fall in the
summer and is up 11.6 percent for the year as of last Friday. But
there are some troubling signs out there.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, the darlings of investors are still large-company
stocks and technology stocks. Tech stocks were also the fair-haired
children before the market started its skid in July. Internet
stocks have once again soared to unbelievable levels, as any
company with ``.com'' in its name is attracting investors like
flies to honey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, if the (market) decline is truly over, you get a
change in leadership in a new bull market, and we did not get a
change in leadership,'' said Richard J. Fruth, a Houston portfolio
manager. ``The market went right back to the old favorites.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CORPORATE EARNINGS LOOK BLEAK &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The outlook for corporate earnings also isn't very good.
</P>
<P>
   We're heading into the end of the quarter and during the end of
any quarter, corporations enter the so-called ``confessional
period'' when they warn about profit disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   That makes it hard to justify high prices of stocks, some
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Coca-Cola joined a growing list of large companies
that have lowered their earnings forecasts for the fourth quarter
due to the volatility of global financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Although the international scene has improved somewhat, it's far
from settled. You've got a deepening recession in Japan and
potential trouble in Latin America if Brazil, the region's largest
economy, falls.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Latin America, things have definitely deteriorated since
the situation in Brazil,'' said Ed Larsen, chief equity officer of
Aim Capital Management in Houston, a mutual fund company.
``Everything isn't just hunky-dory just south of the border.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, ``We are advising no more than 30 percent in the
market now because the risk is so high,'' said Geraldine Weiss,
publisher of Investment Quality Trends in La Jolla, Calif., an
investment newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   The dividend yield of the Dow Jones industrial average is about
1.6 percent, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The yield, which is the annual percentage of return earned by an
investor on a stock, has an inverse relationship to a stock's
price. The lower the yield, the higher the stock price.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the dividend yield of the Dow is ``the lowest in
history,'' Weiss said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another example of the fact that the market is
strenuously overvalued,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the price/earnings ratio of the benchmark Standard
&AMP; Poor's index of 500 large-company stocks is about 30 times
earnings, Weiss said.
</P>
<P>
   That's about where it was in June and before the market started
falling in July.
</P>
<P>
   That compares with an average of about 14.9 times the last
year's earnings since 1950.
</P>
<P>
   The price/earnings ratio represents how much investors are
willing to pay for a company's earnings power. The higher the
number, the more investors expect of a company.
</P>
<P>
   Investors should sock money away in intermediate-term bonds with
maturities of five to eight years and also consider junk bonds and
municipal bonds, Larsen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that a lesson from the summer is that bonds became a
very positive element in diversifying a portfolio,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
INVESTORS LIKE LOW INTEREST RATES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees that stocks are overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   The price/earnings ratio of the S&AMP;P 500 index may appear to be
expensive, but low interest rates have made stocks more attractive
to investors, said Henry Lartigue, chief investment officer of
Chase Bank of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing affects the P/E ratio more than interest rates and
inflation,'' he said. ``The high P/E is justified because the
economic environment is so positive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we ought to be worried, and people do themselves
a disservice by worrying about it (the market),'' said Bob Scraper,
a money manager at Frost Bank in Houston.

 By R.J. SMITH  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    It's audition night at the Bates Motel. In a large, darkened
room on a studio lot in Southern California, three women are
interpreting a pop standard. On a movie screen before them, a
blonde showers.
 &HT;    In succession, each of the trio emits a brutal string of screams
becoming moans shifting to last-desperate-gasps that are meant to
complement the sight of the shower curtain being ripped away, the
knife, the blood swirling down the drain.
 &HT;    Each scream is recorded, and the best will end up in the final
picture. The scene rolls repeatedly, each of the trio able to
withstand two, maybe three takes before her vocal cords are frayed
and unable to release the curdled fear demanded.
 &HT;    ``I want more ... gasping,'' the director says from the corner
of the room.
 &HT;    ``Not enough whimpering?'' the vocalist asks.
 &HT;    ``Yeah. But the scream was really good.''
 &HT;    ``More pain?''
 &HT;    The director thinks a minute, his eyes tracking slowly across a
spread of cold meats and cheeses on a table. ``Wrestling,
struggling, whimpering, breathing,'' he says finally.
 &HT;    ``I'm not going to sleep tonight,'' the vocalist says, walking
back to the couch. Gus Van Sant, the director, chuckles softly.
 &HT;    His career began with the downcast, beautiful ``Mala Noche'' in
1985, and continued on to such defining modern independent films as
``Drugstore Cowboy'' (1989) and ``My Own Private Idaho'' (1991),
movies that put him at the forefront of a wave of independent
filmmakers that included Steven Soderbergh, Allison Anders, Todd
Haynes and Hal Hartley.
 &HT;    Last year he achieved industrywide stature with the
Oscar-nominated ``Good Will Hunting.'' It's his ``moment,'' a time
when he's especially set up to close dream deals and get backing
for pet projects. And maybe that's what he's doing here, foraging
among the shrieks.
 &HT;    But not even Van Sant seems to know for sure. ``This is ...'' he
begins, before giving up. ``I don't know what this is.'' This time
the chuckle is louder.
 &HT;    Maybe the woman in the shower better illustrates the story. The
actress Anne Heche sports a short cut that makes you think first of
Janet Leigh, who 38 years ago met precisely the same end. For Van
Sant isn't filming just a remake of Alfred Hitchcock's ``Psycho.''
He is bringing it back to life shot by shot, using an only slightly
updated script. A new cast, you almost get the feeling, is a
lamentable expedient; this time, it is Vince Vaughn who wears the
dress.
 &HT;    The production is so by-the-book that there is even a director's
cameo: not the fit and square-jawed Van Sant, but an actor
prosthetically made to look like Hitchcock. It seems the largest
concession is that his version is in color _ that's not chocolate
syrup flowing down the drain.
 &HT;    A pair of whys hover over this endeavor. First, why copy a
perfect movie? Dany Wolf, an executive producer, says they had the
blessing of Hitchcock's daughter and of his estate, and that the
master remade himself over the years. Besides, if Hitchcock were
alive today, he too would doubtless be revisiting the Bates Motel.
 &HT;    ``For people like us,'' Wolf says, ``the cinephiles, there's a
controversy. But the kids, they haven't seen the other one and to
them, this movie is 'Psycho.'''
 &HT;    But the other big why involves Van Sant. Why has someone whose
work made the fringe seem so vibrant turned so decisively to the
mainstream? Of course, Van Sant does not look at it that way.
 &HT;    ``Psycho,'' he insists, is a kind of research project, an
attempt to follow every step the master took yet end up in a
different place. ``In its way it's an experimental movie,'' he
says, before hiding behind a pause that qualifies as Hitchcockian.
``A funny kind of experiment that has applications in the
marketplace.''
 &HT;    A couple of days after the looping session, Van Sant kicks his
sneakers off and puts his athletic-stockinged feet up on the desk
next to a new, translucent iMac computer in his office on the
Universal lot. Hanging on the walls are production photos for
``Psycho'' and pictures of the pop group Hanson. Van Sant filmed a
video for the teen idols earlier this year, and still hopes to make
a movie with them.
 &HT;    ``Psycho'' is not an ordinary movie, he explains, and it is not
_ contrary to what has been reported _ anything as crass as a
sequel.
 &HT;    The project seems to have started out as a conceptual art piece
shaped by ideas Van Sant picked up studying painting and film at
the Rhode Island School of Design in 1971. About the first thing
Van Sant learned was the legacy of Marcel Duchamp and the idea of
the readymade, the artwork you make by simply labeling it so. Put a
bottle rack on a pedestal and it's a sculpture. Context determined
meaning, the argument went, and the artist was nothing more lofty
than a furniture mover.
 &HT;    That tradition was taught in the classroom, but around RISD at
the time there was also a circle of artists and performers who
injected a broad streak of irony and humor into their conceptual
gestures. Partly this was the influence of Andy Warhol. (Van Sant
went on to write a screenplay about Warhol's life, and wanted to
cast River Phoenix in the lead.) But part of it was pure
Providence.
 &HT;    Fellow students at RISD had formed the band Talking Heads. (He
saw them play their first show.) One of their acts was lip-synching
``Mustang Sally'' on video _ that made it ``art.'' Also present was
a cluster of art bands inspired by the comic Martin Mull (who in
the '60s was a painter at RISD and leader of the band Soup). The
same musicians would play for an audience, then change costumes,
assume another band identity and perform music from a series of
distinct eras.
 &HT;    There, in the early '70s, gestures of appropriation weren't
exercises in artistic anonymity, as earlier found-object creators
imagined; changing the context had the power to reveal something of
the sensibility of the person in charge.
 &HT;    ``'Appropriation' in some ways just doesn't exist,'' Van Sant
says now. ``As soon as you put something in a different context,
you're imparting your own style. Just by touching it, you become
part of it and it becomes a part of you.''
 &HT;    It was in 1989 when Van Sant, fresh from the success of
``Drugstore Cowboy,'' met with Universal executives, who raised the
idea of remaking a movie from their vaults. They were thinking, Van
Sant says, perhaps of some obscure B-movie to which he could
provide a modern gloss.
 &HT;    He countered with the idea of appropriating ``Psycho,'' and
argued that like a lot of filmgoers he was tired of seeing classic
movies bungled in the update. ``My retort was, 'Let's just not
change it.' And their answer was, 'So let's just not do it.'''
 &HT;    Eight years later, however, Van Sant was no longer one more
indie-movie maker with an offbeat idea in his back pocket. ``Good
Will Hunting,'' a commercial and critical success, demonstrated his
knack for getting stellar performances out of young talent such as
Ben Affleck, Matt Damon and Minnie Driver.
 &HT;    ``He comes up with 'Good Will Hunting,''' says Brian Grazer, the
movie's producer, ``and every person is throwing tons of money,
bags of money into his car, and into his face.'' Grazer, the most
influential producer at Universal, was one of the main
money-flingers. When he tried to interest Van Sant in making a
picture for the studio, the director said he wanted to do a
Universal picture, albeit one that had already been filmed.
 &HT;    Now, Van Sant might not like to see it this way, but
carbon-copying a classic offers insurance against the kind of
career-wounding disasters that can follow a big success. If
``Psycho'' fails _ commercially or critically _ Van Sant can't
really be blamed. And if it's a success, he'll get even more
credibility as an artiste and a businessman.
 &HT;    Van Sant's manner is beyond deadpan and in conversation with
him, you feel as if you could take off your socks and shoes and put
your feet up on the desk too. Except possibly when raving about
Hanson, Van Sant seems weirdly believable, his becalmed voice
underplaying the wide roamings of his mind and the subversiveness
of his ideas.
 &HT;    His father began as a traveling salesman and wound up running a
garment company. And while the son is following the same arc, he
proclaims that he's still living out of his car. He's clutching for
dear life to the high-minded ideas he has long held _ but now he's
the found object, and as his context has shifted, from indie
festivals to the Academy Awards, he refuses to acknowledge any
difference.
 &HT;    His fourth film ``Even Cowgirls Get the Blues'' (based on the
Tom Robbins novel), featured pansexual heroines, drug-taking
characters on the road, elliptical storytelling devices _ it was a
Van Sant film. And yet it got drubbed by critics and ignored by
audiences, a response that did Van Sant damage. It stopped his
forward motion and forced him to think hard about his next step.
 &HT;    So too did the passing of a friend. One night in 1993, River
Phoenix collapsed on a street corner in West Hollywood and died of
a drug overdose. Phoenix was one of the stars of ``Idaho,'' and Van
Sant calls the young actor's death one of the worst moments in his
life. This spring, another member of the cast, Rodney Harvey, died
of a heroin overdose.
 &HT;    Stories of wild living on the ``Idaho'' set have long
circulated, and a recent story in Premiere depicted Phoenix,
Harvey, Keanu Reeves and other cast members living at Van Sant's
house during the shooting and partying so hard the director had to
sleep at another address. It has been suggested that the director
was at least a nonjudgmental voyeur _ watching all the psychodrama
while declining to intervene _ if not a participant himself.
 &HT;    Van Sant says he had no knowledge of drug use in his home. ``I
don't really think of 'Idaho' as a time when there were bad seeds
sown,'' he says. ``If things were really getting out of control,
I'm sure I would have never been able to stand for that. But they
weren't out of control.'' He pauses, and looks away. ``Maybe they
were and I didn't know it.
 &HT;    ``Our little world was pretty tame, compared to 'the legend of
Idaho.' The legend of Idaho is kind of ominous, but it really
wasn't like that.''
 &HT;    After the disaster of ``Cowgirls,'' Van Sant rebounded with the
first of his pictures that anyone could call ``calculating'': ``To
Die For,'' an amusing yet distinctly minor work. If Phoenix's death
ignited old stories of high life on the ``Idaho'' set, ``To Die
For'' seemed designed to show Hollywood that Van Sant could play
ball _ the director himself calls it ``a cleaned-up version of one
of my films.''
 &HT;    It did the trick, bolstering his reputation, and next came
``Good Will Hunting,'' the career maker that presented Van Sant to
the world as a dependable director who could bring an indie flavor
to mainstream fare. The picture boosted his fee to the level of
hit-action-film directors. Van Sant says he got about twice for
``Psycho'' what he made on ``Good Will Hunting.''
 &HT;    During the filming of ``Psycho,'' Van Sant fetishized
Hitchcock's shooting schedule, hewing closely to an economical
32-day plan.
 &HT;    On the screen in the studio, a luxury car is winched out of
bubbling swamp water, the last scene in the movie. Within the
vehicle's trunk the police will find the body of Marion Crane and
the $400,000 she stole from her job the day before she died in the
shower.
 &HT;    The scene repeats as background sounds are recorded. In the next
room Van Sant is on the phone, discussing the logistics of
purchasing and transporting a Lotus from a guy in Portland, Van
Sant's hometown. It is not cheap.
 &HT;    In the end, maybe the director he most resembles isn't
Hitchcock, but Warhol, who never saw a contradiction between high
art and the finer things in life. Warhol too made multiple versions
of the same work, a concept Van Sant says he's considering.
 &HT;    Even now, he jokes that he'd like to remake ``Psycho'' again.
``We'd tell the same story but with different attitudes. I was
thinking we could do a punk 'Psycho,' or a black 'Psycho,' or a gay
'Psycho.' But they would be the same story _ you'd want it to be
the same story. It wouldn't be different, but it would just be
changed.''

DEATHS OF HOMELESS PEOPLE REACH RECORD IN SAN FRANCISCO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY DELGADO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Nearly 160 homeless men and women died in San
Francisco in the past year, the most deaths recorded since the city
began tracking such statistics in 1987, the Department of Public
Health said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A study released by the department blamed the city's dearth of
homeless shelters and lack of substance abuse programs for
contributing to the 157 deaths recorded from Dec. 1, 1997, through
Nov. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The report also attributed the high number of homeless deaths to
a lack of available and affordable housing, the year's
exceptionally wet weather and illness.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the homeless said they were not surprised by the
findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are dying because we're not dealing with the
problem,'' said Paul Boden, director of the Coalition on
Homelessness. ``That number is going to keep on growing until we
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Boden criticized the administration of Mayor Willie Brown for
spending city resources removing the homeless from parks and other
parts of the city rather than focusing on creating more substance
abuse programs and homeless shelters to help them.
</P>
<P>
   The 157 deaths far exceeded both the 104 recorded the previous
year and the average of 118 deaths each year since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   At least 86 deaths during the year were caused by substance
abuse problems. The city's rate of drug deaths is three times that
of the state, the report said. It noted that 62 of those deaths
were heroin-related, while pointing out that more than 500 people
are on waiting lists citywide for methadone treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Low vacancy rates, exorbitant rents and loss of public housing
units have exacerbated the homeless problem,'' the report said.
``At the same time, without permanent affordable housing, it is
exceedingly difficult for homeless people to manage their health
issues, such as diabetes, mental health or addiction.''
</P>
<P>
   The average age of those who died was 42. By comparison, the
national life expectancy rate is 76 years. Of those who died in the
past year, 134 were men, 22 women and one was transgendered, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Some 12,000 to 14,000 homeless people live on San Francisco's
streets, but there are fewer than 2,000 shelter beds available.

THE GREASE THAT NEARLY COOKED MY GOOSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JON HAHN  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the memories evoked by holiday lights, music and warm
smells, none touches me so deeply as a particular Christmas goose.
</P>
<P>
   It near 'bout killed me.
</P>
<P>
   Every family has a story about a holiday mishap: the year the
dog's collar caught in the tree lights and he pulled the whole
shebang down on the living room floor. Or the time Uncle Henry
slipped and broke his arm as he carried the green-bean casserole up
the front walk.
</P>
<P>
   Out on our branch of the family tree, this is the time of year
they tell the story of Jon and the Goose Grease. 'Tis a tale that
to this day causes involuntary quivering deep in my gut.
</P>
<P>
   As children, we reveled in a household full of warm and
wonderful cooking smells during the holidays. Cookies and
fruitcakes and fresh breads and Christmas stollens were baked and
stored away within easy reach of any adventurous child. Hand-dipped
chocolates and tins of nutty fudge were never too far away.
</P>
<P>
   The main Christmas meal was a happy feast that left at least a
week of wonderful leftovers, and we indulged in such delicacies as
pickled herring sandwiches, stuffing and gravy lunches and turkey
soup. And there was leftover pie, cake and cookies enough to carry
us well into the new year.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest treat was leftover goose grease. And although we
almost always had a turkey, our Great-Aunt Margaret and -Uncle Bill
upstairs never varied from the traditional Christmas goose. Nor
from the traditional German fare of goose grease sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   They always found the fattest goose available, so that they were
sure to end up with a goodly amount of grease. This was the golden
egg, so far as we were concerned, because the traditional German
delicacy issued therefrom.
</P>
<P>
   Aunt Margaret and Uncle Bill would carefully pour off the
accumulated grease and save it on the unheated back porch for a few
days. They never had to announce the special day, because we could
smell the grease being rendered, all the way down in the basement
of our two-flat.
</P>
<P>
   They would heat the congealed grease and separate out any other
liquids. In a big black frying pan, they'd cook up bacon bits and
chopped onion, which were drained and then added to the clear, hot
goose grease. Then the whole smear was poured into small butter
crocks and set back on the porch to congeal.
</P>
<P>
   By the next day, it hardened to the consistency of a grainy lard
and emitted a very noticeable eau de G &UR; gfumlaut &LR; ansenschmalz. And
there was great ceremony made of the first partaking, in which a
big glob of hardened goose grease was spread over a hunk of Jewish
rye bread and sprinkled with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the memory of it used to cause pangs of hunger in my
nostalgic stomach. And for years after they died, no one in the
family dared try to duplicate this special dish.
</P>
<P>
   It was as though goose grease had become a special memorial that
had passed along with them _ until the year my older sister decided
that she would accept the mantle of Mother Goose Grease.
</P>
<P>
   My wife and I lived in Michigan at the time, and knew nothing of
this as we drove home for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   On the afternoon we were to drive back to Michigan, she
presented us with a small covered butter crock. I knew without
looking, from the delicious smell, that it was my own special
allotment of goose grease.
</P>
<P>
   I stopped at the supermarket nearest our apartment in Michigan
and bought a cold 12-pack of beer. And even before I had the car
completely unpacked, I stood at the kitchen counter and cut several
big hunks of bread and spread goose grease on it like a
do-it-yourself remodeler on his first wallboard taping-and-seaming
project.
</P>
<P>
   Damn, it was good! So I cut more bread, popped a few more cold
ones and sat down in front of the television. Finally, Wife Person
said: ``It's getting late and there's school tomorrow and I'm beat.
I'm going to bed!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be there in a minute,'' I said as I went back into the
kitchen for a few more hunks of grease-slathered bread.
</P>
<P>
   When she got up the next morning, I didn't stir. I couldn't. I
felt like a goose-grease mine ready to explode. And the sound of
her making breakfast caused the explosion. When I finally stumbled
into the kitchen in my jammies, she was horrified.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're green!'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel green. Where's our Alka-Seltzer?''
</P>
<P>
   The seltzer didn't help. It didn't even stay down where it was
supposed to help. Everything came up. The Ghosts of Christmas
passed, and I was a green, quivering, porcelain-hugging wretch for
two semi-solid days.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost a decade before I could even look at goose grease.
Even just the words caused stomach rumblings when a family member
or friend would ask: ``So, are you gonna have goose grease again
this Christmas?''
</P>
<P>
   But this somewhat wiser man, having been visited by the Angel of
Near Death, has heeded the warning and returned to the Land of the
Living by a more moderate way.

ALL BUTTER COOKIES, BUT IN DISGUISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cookies are always easy, but around the holidays, with time
short and demand high, even they can use streamlining. One solution
is to whip up a single batter _ the food processor is the easiest
way _ and finish it in different ways. You can flavor some and roll
some, and then bake the cookies at different temperatures to fill a
plate with variety.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one batch of dough will yield four types if you
just divide the batter and add lemon juice and zest to one quarter,
chopped walnuts to the second, raisins to the third and coconut to
the fourth. The basic batter can also be varied with spices or
chocolate chips.
</P>
<P>
   But it's great plain, made with white sugar or brown, or even
with a tablespoon of molasses added to the white sugar. It can also
be rolled out and cut; just chill it to make it easier to handle.
</P>
<P>
   The standard _ and perfectly wonderful _ butter cookie contains
equal weights of flour and butter, sugar to taste (usually about
half as much as flour), an egg for every two cups of flour, milk as
necessary to produce a batter and any flavorings.
</P>
<P>
   The proportions of the basic ingredients, the flour, butter,
sugar, egg and milk, determine the underlying taste and texture of
the cookies. Make them with more flour and they're cakey; use more
butter, as I do here, and they're delicate, with better flavor.
</P>
<P>
   I've refined the classic recipe to do all the mixing in the food
processor. Because it's such a powerful machine, it's easy to over
develop the gluten in the flour, which leads to tough cookies.
</P>
<P>
   My solution is to replace a quarter of the flour with
cornstarch, which develops no gluten and, as a bonus, adds a silken
quality. Even so, it's important to process the ingredients gently.
</P>
<P>
   This is also a problem with electric mixers, but rarely with
cookies made by hand. To make the cookies with a mixer or a wooden
spoon, cream the butter and sugar together before adding the dry
ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   The baking procedure is determined by the way you like your
cookies. At 375 degrees, the edges brown nicely and the centers
remain pale and tender after about 11 minutes; at 350 degrees,
there will be no browning and the cookies will take a minute or two
longer. Slightly longer baking times will produce crisp cookies.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, check the cookies every minute or so after eight
minutes have passed. Note the timing of the first batch and the
rest will require less attention. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE MOTHER OF ALL BUTTER COOKIES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: about 30 minutes, or more if cookies are baked in batches &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1{ cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   { cup cornstarch
</P>
<P>
   } cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   Pinch salt
</P>
<P>
   2 sticks chilled unsalted butter, cut into bits
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   1 egg
</P>
<P>
   { cup milk, approximately. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Combine flour, cornstarch, sugar
and salt in a food processor, and pulse once or twice. Add butter,
and pulse 10 or 20 times, until butter and flour are well combined.
Add vanilla and egg and pulse 3 or 4 times. Add about half the milk
and pulse 2 or 3 times. Add the remaining milk a little at a time,
pulsing once or twice after each addition, until the dough holds
together in a sticky mass.
</P>
<P>
   2. Remove the dough from the machine to one or more bowls. Make
cookies as described in Step 3, or make any of the variations
below.
</P>
<P>
   3. To make cookies, drop rounded teaspoons of dough (you can
make the cookies larger or smaller, if you like) onto a nonstick
baking sheet, a sheet lined with parchment paper or a lightly
buttered sheet. If you want flat cookies, press the balls down a
bit with your fingers or the back of a spatula or wooden spoon.
Bake 11 minutes, or until the cookies are done as you like them.
Cool on a rack, then store, if necessary, in a covered container. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yield: about 4 dozen cookies. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All Butter Cookies, but in Disguise &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Variations on the flavor of these butter cookies are limitless.
Here are a few suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Butterscotch cookies: Substitute brown sugar for half or more
of the white sugar, or simply add 1 tablespoon of molasses along
with the egg.
</P>
<P>
   _ Citrus cookies: Omit the vanilla, and add 1 tablespoon of
lemon or orange juice and 2 teaspoons grated lemon or orange rind
along with the egg. A couple of tablespoons of poppy seeds can also
be added.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chocolate chip cookies: Stir in about 1 cup of chocolate
chips. (The butterscotch variation is good with chocolate chips.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Other chunky cookies: To the finished batter, add about 1 cup
of M&AMP;M's (or similar candy), roughly chopped walnuts, pecans or
cashews, slivered almonds, raisins, coconut, dried cherries or
cranberries. Or combine any chunky ingredients you like.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ginger cookies: Add 1 tablespoon ground dried ginger to the
dry ingredients. For even better flavor, add \ cup minced
crystallized ginger to the batter by hand (this works well in
addition to or in place of the ground ginger).
</P>
<P>
   _ Spice cookies: Add 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, \ teaspoon each
ground allspice and ground ginger and 1 pinch ground cloves and
mace or nutmeg to the dry ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can make rolled cookies by freezing the dough for 15
minutes or refrigerating it for at least 1 hour. Working half the
dough at a time, roll it out on a lightly floured surface; the
dough will absorb some flour at first but will soon become less
sticky. Do not add more flour than necessary. Roll about \ inch
thick, and cut with cookie cutters; decorate as you like. Bake as
above, reducing the cooking time to 8 to 10 minutes.

CLINTON LEAVES HIS BEST SUPPORTERS VERY LITTLE TO DEFEND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SAM SPERRY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The photo comes to mind even now. A young Bill Clinton gazing
adoringly into the face of President John F. Kennedy. Two flawed
men. One a war hero who had risked his life to save his comrades.
The other a draft dodger who deceived his colleagues to cover up
his lust.
</P>
<P>
   One was a leader who others _ including Clinton _ could follow.
The other, now a man, would let his followers down. Two flawed men.
One a president still revered for his accomplishments. The other a
president diminishing before his countrymen's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, as the House Judiciary Committee by rote conducted
its process of approving articles to impeach him, Clinton tried one
more time to say he was sorry. It was a sorry performance. Hollow.
Unconvincing. Arrogant. No wonder the so-called moderates on the
Republican side are shifting toward support for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday, when responding to reporter's questions, Clinton
repeated again what few believe: That he did not lie under oath.
No, he would not resign, he said. Hadn't thought of it. From the
Middle East, his obdurate tone left little for opponents of
impeachment to defend.
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, as badly as the Republican puritans have behaved,
there is no escaping the fact and the political reality that
Clinton brought all this upon himself and the nation. Moreover, as
the nation is dragged into this Beltway Theater of Politics, the
central character is focused upon himself.
</P>
<P>
   These are the two inescapable facts of this impeachment: that
Clinton is the perpetrator, not the victim, and that his actions
are directed at saving his place in history.
</P>
<P>
   The youth of promise in the photo became the man of the con.
Listening to Clinton Friday, the flim flam became all the more
obvious: ``Mere words cannot fully express the profound remorse I
feel for what our country is going through, and for what members of
both parties in Congress are now forced to deal with,'' he said
just before he left for the Middle East and what might have been a
celebrated venture to salvage the eternal peace process there.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, what we are going through and what the Congress is
forced to deal with is an entirely unnecessary episode brought on
not by a lust for power and some political purpose but, for _ what
the nuns used to call _ his concupiscence.
</P>
<P>
   People who voted for Clinton, Democrats who supported him, the
women and men who joined his administration have been let down. For
as he squandered his personal stature,
</P>
<P>
   so too did he diminish himself as a moral
</P>
<P>
   figure.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunate are the Democrats for Sen. Joe Lieberman, the man from
Connecticut with the courage to take the Senate floor and in
unforgiving terms rebuke Clinton. Lieberman's condemnation provides
a beacon by which Democratic ships can safely navigate this
political storm.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunate are the Democrats for a citizenry that can separate
the offense of their president from the proper business of the
nation. For those who believe the recent voting in November was not
a referendum on Clinton and his possible impeachment, the fact that
the Dems gained seats offers a portent for Republican policy. Not
since 1822 had the party with a minority in Congress gained seats
during the second term of the president of the same party.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton is to be defended, then, it is not on moral grounds
but on political grounds. That is why the outcome in the House
Judiciary Committee was so predictable. And because impeachment by
design is a political process, it is clear that political
considerations govern it, Clinton's moral failings notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   The hollowness of Clinton's forced mea culpa Friday rang all the
more so with a statement that he would agree to a motion of
censure.
</P>
<P>
   How good of him. How accommodating. How political. How
self-serving.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, this perpetrator now says scold me but don't
impeach me. It is not his call.
</P>
<P>
   This is properly the province of the Congress. And the Congress
is in the hands of people who want Clinton's hide nailed to the
fabric of history as a stained garment, despite Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr's misconduct and unethical investigation. Clinton
lied under oath. He betrayed his most prized companions in Hillary
and Chelsea. He violated the loyalty of his colleagues in
government.
</P>
<P>
   He has left those who would help him with little to embrace.
They must defend on grounds of the national interest and the abuse
of the impeachment process itself. But, Bill Clinton the man? He
has left them nothing to defend.

CHRISTMAS? I'D RATHER NOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - It's that time of year once more when the frogs on TV
beer commercials all wear jingle bells and even mortgage lenders
get all warm and fuzzy.
</P>
<P>
   It is the time of the commercial onslaught: a relentless
television tattoo of ads and endless Kmart Christmas carols.
</P>
<P>
   But I no longer get upset by it, for, even though the
hucksterism is themed for the holidays, it is no different from the
hucksterism we see year-round. Anyone who has not learned to tune
out the commercials had better just give up his U.S. citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   No, it is not the commercialism I mind. What bothers me about
the holidays is what people call ``the true spirit of Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   I can hardly bear all the bright faces and good cheer. And every
time I hear someone say, ``Peace on Earth, goodwill to men,'' I
wince.
</P>
<P>
   It is a wonder to me that ``The Little Drummer Boy'' hasn't led
to more serial killings.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the world I know and love; it is some fantasy world
where each of us gets along and no one is miserable.
</P>
<P>
   My complaint isn't just that Christmas posits a fantasy world,
but worse, the fantasy is not, when properly considered, desirable.
</P>
<P>
   I am bedeviled by well-meaning people who seem to think that it
would be a good thing if the Christmas message were heeded
year-round. That what we all need is not just that nations no
longer be at war, but that each of us, personally, would be freed
from our rancor and stress and a dove of universal peace might
descend upon us.
</P>
<P>
   Supposedly a peace that passeth understanding; but what passeth
my understanding is why anyone would think this a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   It ignores the basic realities of life on the planet and human
psychology.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, if all rancor and striving were eliminated, we
would not be happy, but instead bored beyond toleration. Perpetual
happiness is the land of the lotus-eaters.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I'm not arguing for war. War is the extreme that we should
at all costs avoid.
</P>
<P>
   But so is peace. Peace is only another extreme. By ``peace,'' I
mean that kind of peace that certain popular religions propagandize
for, wherein our torn, ambivalent, striving hearts are calmed and a
kind of universal torpor descends from the heavens to drug us.
</P>
<P>
   And I respond: ``Peace on Earth, goodwill to men? Over my dead
body!''
</P>
<P>
   We mouth the pieties, talk about universal brotherhood and
loving one's neighbor, but we have not thought this through very
carefully.
</P>
<P>
   If we had, we would never ask for peace and goodwill, except in
small, carefully controlled doses.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, we have never been in any danger of getting our wish.
</P>
<P>
   For perfect happiness is perfect inertia. We would be lumps
staring goofily at the ceiling like heroin addicts, incapable of
rousing ourselves: What for? We would be happy, totally satisfied,
in need of nothing. Hence, no need to get up from the chair. Very
much like Sunday afternoon watching the football games.
</P>
<P>
   This is not my idea of a desirable end.
</P>
<P>
   No, everything good in the world is driven into existence by
dissatisfaction. We feel a lack and we move toward it, and we are
kept in constant, productive motion.
</P>
<P>
   We should strive then, not for that warm holiday feeling which
may be only a little too much brandy in the eggnog, but rather for
that gnawing edgy hollowness in the pit of the stomach that tells
us to keep moving forward.
</P>
<P>
   And when we achieve a momentary respite, a brief piece of
happiness, we can then appreciate it all the more for its rarity.
</P>
<P>
   So, when I see jolly Saint Nick, I want to step up and knock his
hat off. When I hear the carolers outside my window, I want to turn
my stereo speakers out and blast rap music back at them.
</P>
<P>
   For my deity is Eris, the Greek goddess of strife and discord.
All the others are pretenders, and strife alone keeps the world
moving forward.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional Christmas celebrates something meant to be
eternal, and therefore stultified. It is a Platonic world.
</P>
<P>
   Give me, instead the world of Heraclitus, where everything is in
constant tumultuous change.
</P>
<P>
   I could enjoy the older, pagan winter holiday, hidden in the
palimpsest of later religious rewriting. That original, with its
trees and lit fires, is a celebration of change, of dissatisfaction
with winter and a longing for the coming spring.
</P>
<P>
   That is something worth celebrating. &QL;

TEMPERING CHOCOLATE WITH OIL  
 KEEPING THE COATING ON THE KOFFEE  
 WHAT GOES INTO VANILLA EXTRACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MELISSA CLARK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have heard that tempering chocolate can be speeded up by
adding a few drops of oil as you melt it. If so, does it affect the
taste or consistency? Which oil is best?
</P>
<P>
   A. You've heard right: a little bit of oil added to melted
chocolate can often allow you to forgo the exacting process of
tempering it.
</P>
<P>
   Tempering chocolate (melting it, cooling it and gently melting
it again) makes it lustrous and stable as a glossy coating for
candies, fruit, cakes and cookies or to create fanciful decorations
like ruffles, curls and lace.
</P>
<P>
   In tempering, the temperature must be carefully watched. But by
stirring 1 tablespoon of oil or other liquid fat (like melted
clarified butter or vegetable shortening) into every three ounces
of melted chocolate, you can create a mixture like tempered
chocolate, one that is colloquially called ``quick tempered''
chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   Quick-tempered chocolate will usually do when a recipe calls for
tempered chocolate. But it is thinner (because of the added fat)
and may not work quite so well for some decorations.
</P>
<P>
   It may also not hold up as reliably if the chocolate is to be
stored. But for home cooks making chocolate to be eaten within
days, it's generally fine.
</P>
<P>
   You can use any type of oil to quick-temper chocolate, but
neutral oils, like canola, vegetable or safflower, won't interfere
with the flavor of the chocolate. On the flip side, butter and nut
oils (like hazelnut or walnut) can add a delightful nuance. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. When enrobing a slab of toffee with chocolate, I pour the
cooked toffee onto a jelly roll pan lined with a Silpat (nonstick
silicon) sheet. When it cools, I invert the slab and pour melted
chocolate over it. When the chocolate sets, I break the slab into
pieces.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that sometimes the chocolate falls right off the
toffee. I have noticed that when the base cools, it's greasy to the
touch. Could this be the trouble, or is it the Silpat sheet?
</P>
<P>
   A. The culprit is that greasy film. Toffee is made with a
generous amount of butter, and often a small amount seeps out of
the hardened candy, creating a slick, slippery coating. When
chocolate is poured on top, it cannot bond with the toffee's porous
surface. It's similar to putting cookie dough on a greased sheet:
it won't stick.
</P>
<P>
   Many confectioners avoid the problem by blotting the top of the
cooled, hardened toffee with a clean kitchen towel to absorb excess
fat. Then you can pour on the melted chocolate without fear of its
separating. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I recently compared two brands of vanilla extract. Both were
labeled ``pure vanilla extract,'' but one label read ``extractives
of vanilla beans in water, alcohol (35 percent),'' and the other
said, ``water, alcohol (35 percent), vanilla bean extractives and
corn syrup solids.'' The first one was more expensive. What is the
difference between the more expensive and the less expensive brand?
</P>
<P>
   A. According to guidelines that have been established by the
Food and Drug Administration, pure vanilla extract must be made
from vanilla beans and alcohol. A small percentage of natural
flavorings, like corn syrup solids, may be added, but artificial
flavorings, like vanillin, are forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   As you would guess, less expensive brands tend to use the
minimum required quantity of costly vanilla beans, then heighten
the flavor with corn syrup. Makers of high-quality, premium brands
of vanilla extract, however, pride themselves on using more vanilla
beans than are actually demanded by law, thus creating a more
richly perfumed extract.
</P>
<P>
   But despite those differences, culinary professionals disagree
about whether expensive vanilla extracts are worth the money and
also whether their sweet scent translates into more flavor in the
final product. For this, there is no right answer, only a matter of
taste.

<P>
   Gourmet Garage in New York has cloned itself yet again. A fourth
market has just opened at 117 Seventh Avenue South (Christopher
Street), adding Greenwich Village to locations in SoHo, the Upper
West Side and the Upper East Side in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The chain has its no-frills formula down pat, with banks of
produce, cases filled with cheeses, an olive bar and shelves
stacked with packaged foods, some bearing the chain's own label,
like the olive oils and potato chips.
</P>
<P>
   What is new here, and will soon be added in the other stores, is
a small but serious fresh meat and fish department, with a butcher
and a fishmonger actually on duty. The prepared-food department is
the largest of any Gourmet Garage and includes fresh chickens
bronzing on a rotisserie. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The aroma of roasting chestnuts is inescapable in midtown
Manhattan these days, but there are better ways to sample that
seasonal flavor. The nutty-tasting fresh chestnut pasta that
Raffetto's, 144 West Houston Street (Sullivan Street), makes at
this time every year is worth buying to sauce with pancetta and
cream or with wild mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
   It's $3.25 a pound, cut to the width you choose, and will be
available through the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Chestnuts segue easily from savory to sweet. La Maison du
Chocolat, 1080 Madison Avenue (78th Street), is an excellent source
for succulent candied chestnuts. These marrons glaces are not
overwhelmed by sugar and don't crumble or fall apart like so many
others.
</P>
<P>
   They are $60 a pound (about 18 plump chestnuts wrapped in gold
foil) and will be available through January. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chasing down a Christmas goose in New York is getting easier.
The Quattro Farms stand, amid the bright pots of poinsettias that
fill the north end of the Union Square Greenmarket now, is taking
orders for its beautifully plump geese, $3.35 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   The birds weigh 9 to 15 pounds; because the meat is so rich, the
smallest bird will feed six to eight people. Roasting a goose is
also an Eastern European Hanukkah tradition, right down to frying
the latkes in the fat, and there's still time to buy one for a
final feast on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Quattro Farms is regularly at the Greenmarket every Saturday,
but during the holidays, the schedule will be Wednesday, Dec. 23
and Dec. 30 (and not on Saturday, Dec. 26 and Jan. 2). Geese can be
ordered through Dec. 21 for pickup at the Dec. 23 market by calling
(914) 635-8202 or (914) 635-2018.
</P>
<P>
   The farm also has a store on Route 44 off the Taconic State
Parkway in Pleasant Valley, N.Y. &QL;

BORED? TRY UPGRADING THE PRINTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HOYE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Want more from your computer? &QL; 
PHOENIX - You could upgrade by adding more RAM, a bigger hard drive
or, well, you know the drill.
</P>
<P>
   But here's something you might not have considered: Get yourself
a printer! Already have one? Then get a better one!
</P>
<P>
   Back when I first started using computers, I thought about
printers the same way I once thought about microwave ovens: Yes,
they'd be nice to have, but who really needs one?
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, you can't buy a house or rent an apartment
without finding a microwave in the kitchen. And just as microwaves
have become indispensable, so, too, have printers become a
necessary piece of the personal computing puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   And over the past year or so, printer makers and software
companies have worked hard to push the utility of color inkjet
printers well beyond the stage of spitting out nasty letters to the
landlord.
</P>
<P>
   Want proof? Look no further than some of the latest software
titles available in the stores.
</P>
<P>
   Palladium Interactive, for example, offers four new titles:
``Forever Fun Works!,'' ``Tattoo Time,'' ``Paper Play Studio'' and
``Dino Sticker Time.''
</P>
<P>
   The programs, which range in price from about $19 to $29,
illustrate a new wave of software that takes advantage of today's
printers. The titles allow kids to create their own stickers,
temporary tattoos, stationery, certificates, bookmarks _ the list
is endless.
</P>
<P>
   I tried ``Dino Sticker Time'' and found it well worth the $19.99
price tag. It loads easily, and comes with a supply of blank
Avery-brand stickers. The interface was simple enough for my
4-year-old son to use, and the Jurassic Park-style soundtrack kept
him entertained while he created his very own stickers (which he
then put all over the walls).
</P>
<P>
   Adults can get in on the fun, too. Printer maker Hewlett-Packard
recently offered a list of ways to use their new color inkjet
printers. The list included:
</P>
<P>
   - Gift bags (Create graphic, print it out and glue to outside of
any bag.)
</P>
<P>
   - Gift boxes (Same as above, but glue to outside of any box.)
</P>
<P>
   - Garden tags (Create custom tag for flowers, veggies or herbs,
print out and glue to Popsicle stick.)
</P>
<P>
   - Family recipe book (Create recipe-card size entries, complete
with images and instructions, then have local print shop bind it or
get a photo album and insert recipes where you would otherwise put
photos.)
</P>
<P>
   - Custom greeting cards
</P>
<P>
   - Personalized placemats for holiday dinners or other special
occasions.
</P>
<P>
   - Custom calendars
</P>
<P>
   - Custom T-shirts or aprons (Create image and print on T-shirt
transfers available in office-supply or computer stores.)
</P>
<P>
   - Holiday ornaments (Create and print image, then fold and glue
into desired shape.)
</P>
<P>
   The list goes on and on.
</P>
<P>
   Need more ideas and specific instructions? Check out ``The Color
Printer Idea Book'' by Kay Hall, published recently by No Starch
Press. The $19.95 book offers complete instructions and
illustrations covering some 40 projects all made possible with an
inkjet printer.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does the book help you through the projects, but it
also offers tips that will help you through anything else you do
with your printer. For example, it teaches you how to avoid the
``computer-generated'' look when you create things, how to get the
best images from your printer, how to use special effects and lots
more.
</P>
<P>
   Want more? Today's software titles also include some fairly
fancy stuff _ programs with powerful capabilities that once were
available only to professionals or those interested in shelling out
$300 to $600 for a single title, such as Adobe's PhotoShop.
</P>
<P>
   Kai's ``Photo Soap,'' Microsoft's ``Picture It'' and other
similar titles give the user the ability to import images (either
from a scanner or directly from a digital camera), clean them up
(such as removing that annoying ``red eye''), crop them, add
backgrounds, special effects or text, and then print them out.
</P>
<P>
   Other programs, such as Broderbund's ``Print Shop 5.0'' or
Palladium's ``Ultimate Scrapbook Creator,'' provide the user with
power to create and print a wide variety of products, ranging from
professional-quality newsletters to customized photo pages you can
insert into photo albums or have bound together.
</P>
<P>
   We've come a long way since the days of the dot matrix printers.
Inkjets have opened doors for home and small-office computer users,
doors that were once too expensive to open or just didn't exist
just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   All fired up to go get a new printer? Great! But do a little bit
of research first. Computer magazines are full of printer
information and reviews. Got Web access? Then visit Yahoo! at
www.yahoo.com and search for printer information. Or, check out
``Family PC'' magazine's printer page at
205.181.113.18/familypc/content/970516/fth w/index.html.
</P>
<P>
   In general, you will get the best results from name-brand
printers, such as Epson, Hewlett-Packard or Lexmark.
</P>
<P>
   As with computers, you will get what you pay for. Some inkjets
are available for about $100. But the nice color units, usually
called ``photo-quality'' printers, will cost $300 to $400.
</P>
<P>
   If you can swing the cost of a photo-quality color inkjet
printer, and if you follow the instructions to get top-quality
prints, you will be amazed by the results. I've actually framed
some prints and have them displayed at home!
</P>
<P>
   When looking for a printer, pay attention to things like ``PPM''
and ``resolution.'' PPM, or pages per minute, tells you how fast _
or slow _ the printer will work. Resolution tells you how fine a
print you will get _ the higher the resolution numbers, the more
photolike your prints will appear.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget the other costs involved with printers _ ink
and paper.
</P>
<P>
   The photo-quality printers produce great prints, but they tend
to really suck up the ink. And color ink cartridges can run as much
as $25 or $30 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Another tricky aspect of printers is paper. There's a lot of
generic printer paper out there that will work well if you just
print black-and-white letters. But to get the best-quality color
production, your printer might require a special paper, usually
something made by the printer maker.
</P>
<P>
   My Epson Stylus Photo printer has this requirement. I've tried
alternative glossy papers, but none work as well as the
photo-quality paper produced by Epson. Don't ask me how they do it!
But buyer beware!
</P>
<P>
   So, if you're looking to get more use out of your computer or if
you just want to have some fun, go get a new printer! &QL;

A BAKING BIBLE, INSTALLMENT NO. 2 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Surrender'' is the word that comes to mind when I think of
Rose Levy Beranbaum's latest book, ``The Pie and Pastry Bible''
(Scribner, $35). Because that is what you must do in order to
appreciate this book.
</P>
<P>
   You do not pick it up and whip together a recipe, casually
adjusting it to the ingredients you have on hand. You do not begin
a recipe after work for dinner that night. No, you surrender to the
master, and you set aside a day to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Beranbaum may be the most meticulous cook who ever lived. To
her, baking is not a free-form, spiritual act. It (italics)is(end
italics) about building rocket ships. Quantities are weighed to the
hundredth of an ounce, temperatures set to the degree, sizes
measured to the quarter inch.
</P>
<P>
   But what separates her from other perfectionists is that she not
only tells you in intricate detail how to make something, but also
tells why you take such pains. After several pages on pastry dough,
I understood why adding vinegar relaxes dough without its losing
flakiness, how baking powder aerates it and how butter keeps flour
from absorbing too much water and making it tough.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to following the instructions, I carefully weighed
my ingredients. I was reluctant to put a third of the cubed butter
and the dry ingredients in the freezer and the rest of the cubed
butter in the refrigerator for 30 minutes before even beginning the
recipe. It seemed to be taking home-baking a step too far.
</P>
<P>
   But once I had all the ingredients in the food processor and
pulsed it exactly six times, as Ms. Beranbaum instructed, what
formed was the lightest, most consistent pastry dough I have ever
felt.
</P>
<P>
   By the second time I made the pastry dough, it went much more
quickly. I remembered which portion of butter went in the freezer
and which went in the refrigerator, so I didn't have constantly to
refer to the instructions. And I had a better understanding about
how the small decisions you make when baking _ like chilling the
ingredients to counteract the heat produced by a food processor _
can have a profound effect on the results. Sure, baking pastry is
much about touch and feel, but as this book makes clear, there is
also chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   I made two very different desserts with that pastry. First, an
orange curd tart with chocolate meringue. The orange curd was
smooth and intense, the meringue fluffy and light, but the flavors
and textures fought one another. A pumpkin pie, however, was a
sensation.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Beranbaum refined it by lining the pastry with crushed
gingersnaps and pecans, and filling it with a custard so light and
creamy it defied gravity.
</P>
<P>
   I was anxious to make her cream cheese pastry dough, which, she
writes, took her several years and more than 50 attempts to
perfect. It is as soft and velvety as old cotton sheets. In an
apple galette, the pastry is rolled into a 16-inch disk, lined with
paper-thin slices of tart apple and sugar, and baked free-form.
It's as thin as pizza and has more flavor than an apple pie five
times as thick.
</P>
<P>
   A scone dough took all of 10 minutes to assemble and baked into
tender triangles dotted with poppy seeds and lemon zest. In the
``Understanding'' section after the recipe, Ms. Beranbaum lays out
the various protein contents in brands of all-purpose flour:
Hecker's, Gold Medal and King Arthur. Hecker's, with its moderate
protein level, she says, is perfect for scones: you get both
tenderness and flakiness.
</P>
<P>
   It is this kind of detail _ the ``Understanding'' sections that
follow each recipe, the charts with both weights and measures, the
kitchen equipment guide _ that elevates this book above most others
on baking.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, even perfectionists have occasional lapses: Muscadet
is listed as an alternative to dolce, spatlese riesling and
Sauternes in a recipe for an apple weincreme chiffon tart. Muscat
might provide a similar sweetness, but certainly not Muscadet.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, I have come to feel dependent on the book. When I want
to make a classic pastry and I want it to be nothing less than
perfect, I will know the one place to go. &QL;

<P>
   2. Place flour mixture in a food processor, and process for a
few seconds to combine. Cut the cream cheese into 3 or 4 pieces,
and add to flour. Process 20 seconds. Add frozen butter, and pulse
until none of the butter is larger than a pea. Add water and
vinegar, and pulse until butter is the size of small peas. The
mixture will not hold together.
</P>
<P>
   3. Spoon mixture into freezer bag. Knead in the bag until it
holds together in once piece and feels slightly stretchy. Remove
from bag, wrap in plastic wrap, flatten into a disk and refrigerate
at least 45 minutes, preferably overnight.
</P>
<P>
   4. When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 400 degrees and set
rack on lowest shelf. Place the dough between two large sheets of
lightly floured plastic wrap. Roll out to [ inch thick and large
enough to cut a 16-inch circle. Use a cardboard template to cut the
circle. Transfer to a 12- to 14-inch round steel pizza pan or an
inverted baking sheet.
</P>
<P>
   5. Sprinkle apple slices with lemon juice. Arrange slices on the
dough, cored sides facing toward the center, overlapping in
concentric circles, starting from the outer edge of the pan. Fold
the border of dough over the apples' edge, pleating it. Brush rim
with milk. Sprinkle apples and rim with sugar. Dot apples with
remaining butter, and bake 40 minutes, or until apples are tender
when pierced and dough is crisp. Cool tart on the pan on a rack
until warm.
</P>
<P>
   6. While it cools, in a saucepan over medium-low heat, heat the
apricot preserves until boiling, and strain them. Stir in the
liquor, and brush this glaze onto the apples.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 8 servings.

GAYS URGE BOYCOTT OF UNITED AIRLINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RACHEL GORDON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Gay-rights advocates are calling for a
nationwide boycott of United Airlines until the carrier agrees to
drop its opposition to San Francisco's domestic partners ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This boycott is to send a message to United Airlines that
irresponsible corporate behavior cannot and will not be tolerated
by fair-minded citizens across this country,'' said David Smith,
senior strategist for the Washington, D.C.-based Human Rights
Campaign, the largest gay rights organization in the country.
</P>
<P>
   United, the largest airline operating at the San Francisco
International Airport, contends the city does not have the
authority to regulate air carriers.
</P>
<P>
   The city ordinance, which took effect June 1, 1997, requires
companies doing business with the city to provide the same benefits
to workers with unmarried partners as they give to married
employees. More than 1,700 companies have extended equal benefits
to workers with domestic partners.
</P>
<P>
   United joined a federal lawsuit filed by the Air Transport
Association _ the trade group for the nation's biggest airlines _
seeking to be exempt from the ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   The American Center for Law and Justice, a conservative
organization linked to the Rev. Pat Robertson, filed a second
lawsuit seeking to overturn the law, citing moral opposition to
domestic partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines contend that only the federal government, not a
local jurisdiction, can force such a requirement on their industry.
</P>
<P>
   In April, U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken issued a complex
opinion on the airlines' lawsuit that sided with the city on some
provisions and the airlines on others. For example, she said
federal law exempts air carriers from the health and pension
provisions of the equal benefits ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   The city, however, contends the airlines still must provide
other benefits such as bereavement and family medical leave,
discounts and free flights provided to married employees.
</P>
<P>
   Wilken still has several issues on which to rule. Both sides
expect the case to be appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Tom Ammiano said he hoped the proposed boycott and
other market forces would compel the air carriers to provide
benefits to unmarried partners.
</P>
<P>
   United issued a news release Tuesday denouncing the boycott,
saying the company only joined the lawsuit to prevent the city from
following through on a threat to sever a lease United holds at the
airport for a maintenance shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without this lease, United's operations at SFO would be
significantly disrupted, adversely affecting the 60,000 passengers
the airline carries to and from the Bay area each day and the
company's 18,000 Bay area employees,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, the statement said, ``is based on one essential
point: that a local government cannot regulate a national
industry.''

 &HT;    EVEN WITHOUT THE GREENHOUSE: TERRIBLE DROUGHTS AHEAD
 &HT;    450 words
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The costly ``Dust Bowl'' drought of the 1930s was
little more than a bad dry spell, compared to the kind of weather
that lies ahead, government scientists warned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   It has happened before.
</P>
<P>
   Records stored by nature in the bottom of lakes and the growth
rings of ancient trees show that in the late 1300s and again in the
late 1500s, withering ``megadroughts'' lasting at least 25 years
descended on western North America, said National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration climatologists Connie A. Woodhouse and
Jonathan T. Overpeck.
</P>
<P>
   Sand dunes rolled across much of the Great Plains _ and can be
found beneath now-fertile topsoil in some areas _ and Sierra Nevada
mountain lakes that today provide water for much of California
dried up completely.
</P>
<P>
   Though computer models that attempt to project ``greenhouse
effect'' climate changes suggest one result of a hotter Earth will
be more arid conditions to the U.S. Midwest, the two scientists
pointed out during an interview that droughts 400 and 600 years ago
had nothing to do with human-induced global warming.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturing, transportation, electric power generation and
other fuel-burning activities that pump tons of extra carbon
dioxide into today's atmosphere obviously weren't happening back
then.
</P>
<P>
   The droughts centuries ago occurred because of natural climate
variations and therefore will undoubtedly occur again, the
scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   But, Overpeck noted, the natural records provide troubling
evidence that Earth's climate responds abruptly to changing
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``These abrupt shifts appear more likely when the climate is
changing,'' he said. ``As the Earth warms in the future, we could
get sudden, surprising shifts.''
</P>
<P>
   The two ``megadroughts'' were discovered in growth rings from
old trees, including post oaks in Arkansas and northern Texas and
ponderosa pines in California, Woodhouse said. During droughts,
trees grow more slowly, and the rings are narrower.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, lake sediments show corresponding shifts in the
kind of diatoms _ microscopic plants _ that lived in the lakes.
With less rainfall, lakes became more saline, and the changed
conditions caused diatoms that thrive on saltier water to increase,
while freshwater plants declined.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have tracked similar, though less dramatic, changes
in aquatic plant life in response to modern fluctuations in
rainfall, Woodhouse said.
</P>
<P>
   Overpeck is head of NOAA's paleoclimatology program, and
Woodhouse is a University of Colorado scientist working at NOAA's
National Geophysical Data Center in Boulder. Their report was
published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.

<P>
   First, the aroma beckons. The intense scent drawing you in is
unmistakably that of rich chocolate, but you detect exotic hints of
clove, coffee, orange peel, even cedar. The bar is dark and shiny,
scored into sections. It breaks cleanly, with a definite snap.
</P>
<P>
   At this point you don't even need to taste it to know you're
dealing with extremely fine chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   This is the dark bittersweet kind that delivers its flavor
without the intrusion of a milky taste or an overdose of sugar. You
take a bite, and as it softens and melts in your mouth, the
complexity is comparable to a good red wine. The chocolate feels
satiny, utterly smooth and flawless. The flavor lingers, but you
must have another taste.
</P>
<P>
   And you can be frivolous about it, no longer worrying, as you
might have just a few years ago, that if you polish off this
excellent chocolate you might not find more. Supply and demand are
merging, and chocolate that's worlds away from the run-of-the-mill
candy bar is in every fine-food shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was always this given in the industry that Americans
only liked sweet milk chocolate,'' said John Scharffenberger, a
founder of Scharffen Berger Chocolate Maker in San Francisco, which
introduced a brand 10 months ago that rivals European chocolate.
``But the level of consumer interest has taken us completely by
surprise. Americans never had much of the better dark chocolate
before, and they seem ready for deeper flavor and more
complexity.''
</P>
<P>
   That was evident when the Chocolate Show, an exposition that has
been staged in France for the last four years, was held in New York
for the first time, on Thanksgiving weekend. More than 10,000
people attended, and they weren't there just to nibble. The
educational seminars overflowed. often with double the number
anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Although 73.5 percent of the American market still prefers milk
chocolate over dark, that number has slipped from 80 percent a
decade ago, according to the Chocolate Manufacturers Association, a
trade group in McLean, Va. At the same time, total chocolate
consumption has continued to grow, inching up to 12.1 pounds a
person in 1997 from 11.5 pounds in 1990. But that's just chocolate
chips compared with the rest of the world; the United States still
trails 10 other countries on a list headed by England, which has a
per-capita consumption of 30 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the problem has been the kind of chocolate Americans have
been eating.
</P>
<P>
   Until the last few years, European and South American
chocolatiers were the only ones producing chocolate with the best
cacao beans and few additives _ and it could be difficult to find
in American markets.
</P>
<P>
   But today fine chocolate like Valrhona from France, Callebaut
from Belgium, Lindt from Switzerland and El Rey from Venezuela are
increasingly easy to find. And they have been joined by American
chocolates just as powerful, and often at prices just as high.
Several, including Fran's in Seattle, Richard H. Donnelly in Santa
Cruz, Calif., and Larry Burdick in Walpole, N.H., are using better
grades of chocolate in filled assortments and fancy truffles.
</P>
<P>
   Look what's happened with Scharffen Berger. The company makes
only dark chocolate, originally developed for chefs in an
industrial six-pound slab that could be whacked apart only with a
cleaver. The company soon added smaller, more manageable bars of
its bittersweet and unsweetened varieties and has just introduced a
semisweet. Now two-thirds of Scharffen Berger's sales are to retail
customers willing to pay $4 or more for a three-ounce bar.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Doyle, who was at the Chocolate Show with his wife, Lyn,
said, ``We're chocoholics _ we like to eat chocolate, the darker
and less sugar the better.'' The Doyles are so passionate about
chocolate they traveled all the way from West Lafayette, Ind., for
the event.
</P>
<P>
   Eating chocolate intended for baking used to be unthinkable. A
few chips filched from the tollhouse cookie dough, maybe, but only
desperation would drive anyone to nibble those semisweet squares
wrapped in white paper that slide out of boxes from the
supermarket. But it is high-quality, European-style chocolate
intended for baking that gave many Americans their first taste of
serious chocolate, often in top restaurants. Chefs have become as
fussy about their chocolate as they are about their fresh herbs.
</P>
<P>
   What makes all these chocolates superb? It starts with the
selection of the cacao beans and how they are fermented, roasted
and blended. The finesse with which the chocolate is processed and
how much sugar or other ingredients are added all affect the aroma,
flavor and texture.
</P>
<P>
   Like winemakers, chocolate makers start by homing in on the best
beans from particular regions and microclimates. Most of the
world's chocolate is made from forestaro beans, the equivalent of
the cheaper robusta beans that dominate the coffee business.
Forestaro is the most disease-resistant, highest-yielding cacao,
from trees grown in Brazil and West Africa, but it is certainly not
the most flavorful and tends to have a rough, astringent taste.
</P>
<P>
   Trinitario, from Central America, has a more pronounced flavor
and is usually blended with forestaro to give it character.
Criollo, grown mostly in Venezuela and Central America but also in
Indonesia, is the richest and most fragrant, but it is also the
most fragile, rarest and costliest. Most chocolate is a blend, and
the more trinitario and criollo, the better the flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Once the bumpy football-size cacao pods are harvested, the beans
are taken out and left to ferment for a few days in the tropical
heat. Fermentation turns them from violet to brown and encourages
the characteristic aromas and flavors of chocolate to develop.
Next, the beans are dried, then roasted.
</P>
<P>
   The finest European and European-style chocolates are made from
beans that have been roasted longer and at lower temperatures than
most American manufacturers use, so the chocolate delivers more
nuanced flavors. The quicker, higher-heat roasting generally
employed in the United States tends to result in more bitterness,
which is masked only by adding more sugar and ingredients like
vanilla. Some American chocolates are overloaded with vanilla.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After roasting, the beans are cracked open and their husks
winnowed away, leaving the essence of chocolate, called the nibs.
These are ground, heated and turned into chocolate liquor, a thick,
nonalcoholic substance that is about half cocoa butter, which is
melted and separated out. The rest of the liquor is finely ground
and can be turned into cocoa powder or mixed with cocoa butter,
sugar and other ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   At this point the chocolate goes through a final refining, or
pulverizing, process called conching (the ``ch'' is pronounced as
in ``poncho''). The longer the chocolate is conched, the more
velvety it will feel. The highest quality chocolate may be conched
for up to three days.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers do not reveal how long they conch their chocolate,
but in fact, it has become easier to determine the quality of a
chocolate even before the bar in unwrapped. The best bars now have
a percentage on the wrapper indicating the amount of chocolate _
the combination of cocoa butter and cocoa solids _ it contains, and
that's a guide to sweetness and quality.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration requires that all semisweet and
bittersweet chocolate contain a minimum of 35 percent chocolate, a
decidedly low standard. Sweet chocolate must have 15 percent, and
milk chocolate only 10 percent. The manufacturers of low-grade
chocolate stick to the minimum and bulk up the product with sugar,
emulsifiers, vegetable oil and other fats and fillers. (White
chocolate is technically not considered chocolate because it
contains no chocolate liquor. The cheapest white chocolate may even
be made without any cocoa butter.)
</P>
<P>
   The finest semisweet and bittersweet chocolates post percentages
ranging from 62 to 72 percent. And there is little or no room for
junk in a bar that's 70 percent chocolate _ the rest is basically
sugar. On the other hand, once ingredients like nuts and liqueurs,
praline and fruit peel are added to fine chocolate, the percentage
that is pure chocolate decreases. Top-quality milk chocolate may
only have 54 percent chocolate solids.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers game began with Valrhona about 10 years ago and now
is used increasingly by others, including Lindt and several
American companies, including Scharffen Berger, Chocolove and
Richard H. Donnelly. Usually if no percentage is given, you can
assume it is less than 60, often considerably less.
</P>
<P>
   Another indication of quality is naming the source of the cacao
beans on the label. Valrhona offers chocolates from different
regions and various blends, from the Caribbean and South America.
Its Caraibe chocolate, for instance, is labeled pure Caribbean
trinitario. As with wines or coffee, each delivers a different
flavor profile.
</P>
<P>
   Once you unwrap chocolate, you can gauge it by eye: the best is
flawlessly smooth, with a lustrous sheen. This applies not just to
plain bars but also to dipped or molded chocolate candies and
truffles. Dull or grayish spots or streaks may be a sign of
inferior quality, poor handling or bad storage conditions.
</P>
<P>
   You also judge chocolate by the way it breaks at room
temperature. It should not crumble or splinter, but should have
what is called ``snap,'' a clean brittleness. The milk solids added
to milk chocolate soften the texture and prevent it from having the
same snap as dark chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   The aroma should be rich and intense, even fruity, winy, spicy
or with a hint of cedar or tobacco. You should not detect musty,
charred or chemical smells.
</P>
<P>
   And let's face it, if you like chocolate, the proof is in the
eating. The rich intensity of the chocolate should be balanced, but
never overwhelmed, by sweetness. Nor should it be be too bitter,
although that's a matter of personal preference. If you're used to
run-of-the-mill chocolate, a high-octane chocolate might even
overwhelm your taste buds at first.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's texture. Because chocolate melts at close to body
temperature, it should start to melt in your mouth, with a smooth
creaminess and nothing waxy, gritty, gummy or greasy about it.
</P>
<P>
   Hints of spice or of fruit like berries or citrus often add
complexity to the chocolate, as does a touch of nutty, licorice or
caramel flavor. Some lively acidity, an attribute you might seek in
good coffee or fine red wine, can also enhance chocolate. The
aftertaste should linger pleasantly. Only by tasting, as often as
possible, can you begin to fathom the variations from brand to
brand and even among the styles offered by a single brand.
</P>
<P>
   With great chocolate, even the unsweetened type can provide
sensory pleasure. Unsweetened supermarket baking chocolate is
inedible. But a few small bites of 99 percent chocolate from La
Maison du Chocolat, for example, with a coffee or cognac can be
thoroughly satisfying, extreme chocolate for those who dare.

   5 ounces (1\ sticks) butter, softened
</P>
<P>
   4 eggs, separated
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon flour
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of salt
</P>
<P>
   1 to 6 tablespoons granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   Whipped cream for serving (optional).
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Place rack in lower third of
oven. Butter an 8-inch springform pan. Fit the bottom with a round
of parchment paper and butter the paper.
</P>
<P>
   2. Place chocolate in top of a double boiler and place over
simmering water until nearly melted. Remove from heat, stir to melt
completely, then beat in the butter a little at a time. Transfer
mixture to a large bowl.
</P>
<P>
   3. Beat egg yolks about 5 minutes until thick. Whisk in the
flour, then fold the egg yolk mixture into the chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   4. Beat egg whites with salt until softly peaked. Add the sugar
and continue beating until the whites hold peaks but are still
creamy-textured, not dry. Quickly fold one-third of the whites into
the chocolate until almost blended in. Then fold in the rest, just
until both mixtures are incorporated. Pour batter into pan and
gently rotate pan to level the batter.
</P>
<P>
   5. Bake cake 15 minutes, remove from oven and allow to cool to
room temperature. It will seem underbaked and may be cracked on
top. Use a sharp knife to cut the cake away from the sides of the
pan, then refrigerate it in the pan at least 4 hours or overnight.
</P>
<P>
   6. Cut around the pan again, remove the sides and invert the
cake on a rack. Lift off the bottom of the pan, peel off the paper,
then invert the cake again to serve it. Serve with whipped cream,
if desired.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 8 to 10 servings.
</P>
<P>
   Note: The amount of sugar depends on the bitterness of the
chocolate. If you are using chocolate that is labeled 70 percent
chocolate solids, you will need the 6 tablespoons of sugar. With 62
to 65 percent chocolate, use 3 tablespoons, and with chocolate that
is less than 62 percent or that does not have the percentage on the
label, use 1 tablespoon.

A `PEONY' THRIVES IN HYBRID FORM NEAR PARIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The Autumn Festival in Paris had the clever idea of
offering two contrasting productions of ``The Peony Pavilion'' to
celebrate the 400th anniversary of Tang Xianzu's classic Chinese
opera. But the Shanghai Kunqu Opera Company's complete 20-hour
version, originally scheduled to open this summer's Lincoln Center
Festival in New York, was again banned from leaving China as too
``feudal'' and ``pornographic.'' So Peter Sellars' three-hour
avant-garde version has had the stage to itself here.
</P>
<P>
   It has left those unfamiliar with kunqu opera (let's face it,
most Westerners) with the task of evaluating the experimental
without the standard of the traditional. As it is, audiences at the
Bobigny cultural center outside Paris are inevitably left guessing
how much of Sellars' ``Peony Pavilion'' is original kunqu and how
much has been added to reach out to Westerners. For all that, it
still looks and sounds pretty Chinese, though not exactly 400 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in a sense, Sellars has brought Tang Xianzu's 55-act
masterpiece closer to the China of today. While Chinese opera never
recovered from the censorship and dismantling of theater companies
that accompanied Mao Tse-tung's Cultural Revolution, its survival
is now threatened by the growing popularity of Western music,
movies and television. So it is conceivable that Sellars'
Westernized homage to traditional Chinese culture would appeal more
to many young Chinese than the original. This theory may even be
tested if, as the 41-year-old American director hopes, the
production travels to China in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The essence of the story, a sort of ``Romeo and Juliet'' in
reverse, remains intact in this version. Du Liniang, a 16-year-old
girl from a powerful family, dreams of a young scholar who makes
love to her. When she awakens, she is so saddened not to find him
that she starves herself to death, leaving a self-portrait on her
tomb. Three years later, the scholar, Liu Mengmei, falls for the
painted image just as Du's ghost appears. They become lovers and,
although Du reveals that she is dead, Liu succeeds in bringing her
back to life.
</P>
<P>
   Sellars' point of departure could not have been more authentic.
In 1990, while directing the Los Angeles Festival, he met Hua
Wenyi, a veteran Chinese actress trained in the tradition of kunqu
(pronounced kun-SHOO) and practiced in playing the role of Du, who
had just moved to California. ``Here was this living national
treasure whose art form no one in the West knew how to read,'' he
said. ``So the big question for me was, how could we in the West
begin to realize what she does?''
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, Ms. Hua, a former artistic director of the
Shanghai Kunqu Opera Company who is now in her 50s, was also
interested in trying something new. ``She became the driving
force,'' the director recalled. ``She didn't want to go back to
tradition. She wanted tradition to take its next steps into the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   The project took almost a decade to come to fruition as Sellars
organized seminars and workshops to help him come to grips with the
kunqu tradition. For the text, he chose a translation by Cyril
Birch, 73, an English-born Chinese scholar who moved to the
University of California at Berkeley in 1960. For the music, he
turned to Tan Dun, 41, an avant-garde composer who was born in
China and now lives in New York. Asked to provide incidental music,
Tan delivered a two-hour opera, the first half comprising kunqu
melodies, the second half a rousing blend of kunqu, Tibetan and
Western chants, instruments and rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the addition of a different generation of Chinese artist,
we began to get a rather rich picture,'' Sellars said. ``What's
quite interesting is that Hua Wenyi and Tan Dun would never have
met in China because Hua Wenyi was at the highest level of official
culture and Tan Dun was a young artist whose work was officially
discouraged.''
</P>
<P>
   George Tsypin, who has designed many of Sellars' operatic
productions, most recently Messiaen's ``St. Francois d'Assise,''
placed this version well in the 20th century by creating a large,
transparent rectangular box that serves as both bed and watery
grave for Du as well as transparent screens with television
monitors trapped inside them. These and other monitors carry images
captured by camcorders held by Du and Liu.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the greatest innovation in the production, which has
already been seen in Vienna, London and Rome and will travel to
Berkeley in March, is that Du and Liu are each represented
simultaneously first by two, then by three performers. In China,
where the kunqu tradition embraces acting, dancing and singing,
this would not be necessary. Yet here, force majeure _ Ms. Hua
could not play a 16-year-old girl, nor does she speak English _
created a fascinating counterpoint of cultures and generations.
</P>
<P>
   Two young Asian-Americans _ Lauren Tom, of Chinese descent, and
Joel de la Fuente, of Filipino extraction _ play the
English-speaking roles of Du and Liu. (At times the mixture of
colloquial and poetic language jars.) Ms. Hua dances and sings the
role of Du in the kunqu fashion, but in Paris she has been joined
by Michael Schumacher, an American who dances the role of Liu in
the experimental disjointed style of William Forsythe's Frankfurt
Ballet. Their silent dance of love is perhaps the emotional high
point of the first act.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was marvelous,'' Sellars said excitedly of this addition to
the evolving production, which runs in Paris through Dec. 22. ``Hua
Wenyi really wanted to meet a kind of cutting-edge dance world
where her sense of refinement of movement could meet a language
that is equally articulated and refined.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second act, the two couples are joined by a fresh Du and
Liu, in this case a soprano (Nancy Allen Lundy and Ying Huang
alternate as Du) and a tenor (Michael Hart-Davis and Lin Qiang Xu
alternate as Liu) whose passionate arias mirror the narrative as
the two lovers finally meet. If these operatic voices sound more
Western, though, kunqu is still present in the singing of the
priestess Sister Stone, played by Shi Jiehua.
</P>
<P>
   Sellars sees topicality in the play's treatment of teen-age
suicide and its endorsement of idealistic dreams, yet onstage what
speaks loudest, in the director's words, is the ``genuine cultural
discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have Lauren Tom, who was born in Chicago and does not
speak a word of Chinese, trying to make contact with Hua Wenyi, the
most famous living Chinese actress, who now lives in Los Angeles
and doesn't speak English,'' he said. ``For Lauren Tom, it means
recovering part of her heritage that she never knew, and for Hua
Wenyi, it means moving forward into her new life as an American.''

A WORLD OF PREMIUM CHOCOLATES AT THE CLICK OF A MOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By S.A. BELZER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   High-quality chocolate _ good for last-minute gifts or
self-indulgence _ has found a richly deserved, tantalizing place in
the international bazaar of the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Connoisseurs and chocaholics won't go away disappointed at
chocolatepicure.com. The site represents chocolate makers from
France, Italy, Belgium, Britain and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   They were chosen, Sheri Syler Adams, the president of the
company, writes by e-mail, for the high percentage of cocoa (which
is what makes chocolate taste like chocolate) in their wares, as
well as the cocoa butter and natural vanilla. Richard Donnelly's
bittersweet chocolate bar, made in California, for instance, is 67
to 70 percent cocoa.
</P>
<P>
   Donnelly, who studied his craft in France and Belgium, wraps his
bars in gold foil and handmade papers. They are sold in assortments
(6 1.75-ounce bars for $30, 10 1-ounce bars, $35.50, both with
shipping).
</P>
<P>
   An assortment ordered from the Web site _ it included dark
chocolate (bittersweet, five-spice and almond) and milk chocolate
(coconut, cappuccino and hazelnut almond toffee) _ arrived in New
York three days later.
</P>
<P>
   The Donnelly 7.5-ounce gift box ($38.50, with shipping) is an
appealing assortment of 20 to 24 truffles and other bonbons.
</P>
<P>
   Also available are chocolates from Wittamer of Brussels, a top
Belgian chocolate maker (a 1.65-pound box of mixed chocolates, no
alcohol in the centers, $97.50, shipping included; three to seven
days from Belgium), and Valrhona, the pride of France (for
instance, four 3.5-ounce Le Noir Amer dark bittersweet chocolate
bars, 71 percent cocoa, $22.25, with shipping).
</P>
<P>
   The site offers reading matter and recipes, too.
</P>
<P>
   Fran's Chocolates in Seattle (www.franschocolates.com) is well
worth a virtual visit. Fran Bigelow started with one shop in 1982
and now has three. Her chocolates are handmade and hand wrapped,
using Belgian Callebaut and Venezuelan chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   Among the containers in which she packs her chocolate are washi
paper boxes, handmade and screen printed. They were modeled on
Japanese tea boxes by a Northwest artist, and she uses them for
dark-chocolate truffles ($48 for 12 ounces, $60 for 16 ounces, plus
shipping).
</P>
<P>
   Fran's signature box, containing her truffle and chocolate-cream
favorites, comes in three sizes, from 7 ounces (14 pieces, $15) to
1 pound 2 ounces (36 pieces, $34); shipping is extra. But Fran's
Gold Bars are her big seller. A gift package of six bars with
almonds or macadamia nuts, for instance, is $10.50, plus shipping.
</P>
<P>
   To arrive in New York in time for Christmas, orders have to be
placed in the next day or so.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country in Tallahassee, Fla., is Pierre Vivier, who
began making chocolates in the early 1960s as an apprentice in
France to Maurice Jouvenal, a second-generation chocolatier
himself. Vivier went to Florida in 1974 and opened a French
restaurant and bakery soon after.
</P>
<P>
   On his Web site (www.pvchocolates.com), he writes, ``After 15
very successful years, I sold the restaurant, to pursue what I love
the most, making fine chocolates.''
</P>
<P>
   Vivier makes all his chocolate pieces himself by hand. He uses
top-grade imported chocolate like Valrhona and Callebaut, along
with cream and butter. The fillings include imported sour cherries
in alcohol: Cointreau, Cognac, amaretto and rum. Vivier sells his
chocolates in assortment boxes of 7 ounces for $15.95 and 14 ounces
for $29.95 (shipping extra). A box ordered from the site took a
week to arrive in New York. Vivier writes that Dec. 21 will be the
last day he can ship orders for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   While not strictly a Web operation (orders have to be phoned
in), Flyer candy bars, a far cry from the movie refreshment counter
variety, have a site (www.800candybar.com) to browse. The seeker
after chocolate can find descriptions of the Flyer bars, which are
made from Swiss chocolate, color-wrapped with a gold plane logo.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the varieties contain Flyer caramel, made, the company
says, ``the old-fashioned way, by caramelizing sugar with fresh
butter and heavy dairy cream.'' Boxes of 12 are $22 or $27,
depending on weight, plus $7.50 for shipping. Oh, yes, the numbers
are (800) 226-3922 and (877) 226-3922: the repeated theme,
``226-3922,'' spells ``candy ba(r).''
</P>
<P>
   Orders placed until early next week should arrive before
Christmas. For an urgent gift or treat need, it must be said that
Flyer bars can also be bought at Gourmet Garage, Dean &AMP; DeLuca and
Butterfield Market. (The folks at the toll-free numbers will
provide information on shops in other localities.)

COOKS FIND A BETTER WAY TO GRATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It started out merely as a carpenter's tool, a rasp, an
efficient device meant to file wood. Who could have guessed that it
was an epiphany away from greatness in another arena: the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   The big moment came in 1995, when Lorraine Lee, a homemaker in
Ottawa, Canada, was making an Armenian orange cake. Out of
frustration with her old grater, she picked up a new rasp her
husband had brought home from their hardware store, Lee Valley
Tools. She slid the orange across its blades and was amazed _ lacy
shards of zest fell from its surface like snowflakes.
</P>
<P>
   The Lees marveled at the rasp, ate the cake, then promptly
changed the product description in their catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Sales soared from a dozen or two rasps a month to about 10,000 a
year, and a serious buzz began in the cooking world. Suzen
O'Rourke, the owner of Cooking By the Book, a culinary school in
Manhattan, discovered the rasp about three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went wild,'' Ms. O'Rourke said. So wild that she tracked
down the maker _ Grace Manufacturing in Russellville, Ark. _ and
got an exclusive agreement to sell the rasp as a kitchen tool in
the United States. Three models _ the zester, a cheese grater and a
spice grater _ are the only kitchen products she sells, and they've
turned out to be popular stocking stuffers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' she said, drawing her voice low, ``Martha Stewart
is giving them away as her personal gift this Christmas.'' She has
ordered several hundred, Ms. O'Rourke said.
</P>
<P>
   The box grater has long been the square wheel of the kitchen,
grating the fingers of cooks as well as the food they want to
grate. But the rasp _ commercially dubbed the Microplane _ scrapes
zest off citrus fruit and grates cheese with just a gentle sweep
down its surface.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is in how it is made. Most zesters simply have
holes punched into a flat or curved piece of stainless steel or
tin. The Microplane's edges are formed by a process called
photo-etching: the holes are dissolved with ferric chloride, so
they are like hundreds of tiny razors. Grace Manufacturing, which
also makes medical devices, adapted the technique from one they
were using on computer parts.
</P>
<P>
   Grace has recently developed new models with larger grating
areas and ergonomic handles, but they are not yet for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Microplanes may be ordered from Lee Valley Tools Ltd., Ottawa,
Canada, (800) 871-8158. The zester (No. 27w02.07) is $8.95; the
cheese grater (27w04.10) is $10.75, and the spice grater (27w04.03)
is $8.75. Shipping and handling not included. At Cooking By The
Book, 11 Worth St. (West Broadway), (212) 966-9799, the zester is
$13.50, the cheese grater is $16.50, and the spice grater is
$13.50.

`THE LORD WILL GATHER ME IN': A SECULAR JEW FEEDS A HUNGER  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The title of this very personal story of spiritual quest by
David Klinghoffer comes, we learn by reading his epigraph, from
Psalm 27: ``Should my father and mother abandon me, the Lord will
gather me in.'' Well, Klinghoffer's parents, who brought him up in
an affluent Reform Jewish household in Southern California,
certainly did not abandon him. But Klinghoffer, 33 and a senior
editor at the National Review magazine, was adopted at birth, so in
a way he was abandoned by his biological father and mother. And
when he says that the Lord gathered him in, he means that he sees
in the pattern of his life a plan for him to find meaning and
fulfillment in the strict and demanding practice of Orthodox
Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   One can be skeptical that Klinghoffer's personal religious
journey was part of a divine plan and still find ``The Lord Will
Gather Me In'' rewarding. It recounts a transformation from a
wisecracking California boy born to an unknown Swedish immigrant
into an Orthodox New York Jew who wears fringes on his
undergarments (symbolic of the 613 biblical commandments) and a
skullcap, and whose most intense joy is to study Torah, the
documents and laws that form the basis of Jewish practice and
belief.
</P>
<P>
   Klinghoffer's account of this rebirth as a Jew is barbed at
times, poignant at others; it is modest in its religious learning,
but thoughtful and informed in those few places where Klinghoffer
does tackle theological questions. His brief disquisition on
``family purity,'' the Orthodox practice whereby spouses maintain
conjugal separation during the wife's menstruation, is a model of
clarity. Here and there Klinghoffer's text takes on an annoyed,
uncharitable, unkindly tone, especially when he speaks of the
varieties of the Jewish experience that he does not find authentic.
But he writes with integrity and insight, making clear and tough
demands on himself, and his story of struggle with God and identity
is moving.
</P>
<P>
   Klinghoffer did not come to his Jewish identity easily. He knew
that his birth mother was not Jewish and that technically that made
him a Gentile. (In his final chapters, he describes how he
discovered the identities of his birth parents and established a
warm relationship with his biological mother.)
</P>
<P>
   His life for years was a briar patch of contradictions. For
reasons too complicated to explain here but that are fully detailed
by Klinghoffer, he went through three separate conversion
ceremonies, including three symbolic circumcisions. Even as he
became absorbed by his Jewishness, he formed a serious attachment
to a young Roman Catholic woman who pleaded with him to accept
Jesus, leading an anguished and confused Klinghoffer to open
himself up to some sign of guidance from the Saviour. When no such
sign came, he took his first major step toward strict Jewish
observance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would guess,'' he writes, ``that not many Jews have tried to
strike up a conversation with Jesus one night and a few nights
later commenced observing the Jewish Sabbath for the first time in
their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on Klinghoffer writes rather bitterly of the spiritual
thinness of the Reform Judaism in which he was reared, contrasting,
for example, the simple dignity of an Orthodox bar mitzvah with the
garish and vulgar displays he knew among the Reform Jews of
Southern California. He speaks disparagingly of the decision, made
by Conservative Jewry in 1950, to allow Jews to drive to the
synagogue on the Sabbath, something prohibited by the Orthodox.
Conservative observance, as a result, ``died by a hundred small
cuts,'' Klinghoffer writes in disapproval of what he sees as this
assimilationist backsliding.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt many Conservative Jews (including this critic) will
want to argue with much of this. Klinghoffer's complaint about
vulgarity really has to do with the shallow materialism of the
nouveau riche, not with a variety of Jewish practice. Vulgar
displays of conspicuous consumption have occurred among the
Orthodox as well as the Reform. And driving on the Sabbath might
have done more to save Jewish observance than inflict a death of a
hundred cuts. Suburban Jews are more likely to give up observance
altogether than to move back to the city so they can be within
walking distance of a synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   Plainly, there are a lot of Jews who do not inspire
Klinghoffer's admiration, and, in some instances, his criticism is
well directed. (He writes, for example, of Orthodox groups whose
lack of appreciation for ``the privilege of living in America'' is
shown by their habit of holding their national conventions on
Thanksgiving.) But Klinghoffer is eloquent and stubborn as he makes
his case for orthodoxy as the only authentic Jewish practice and
identity. For him, true Judaism must be rooted in knowing Torah,
observing the commandments and believing above all that they come
from God.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that for many Jews living in America more freely
and more openly than Jews have ever lived in the Diaspora before,
Judaism has become an amalgam of things not necessarily dependent
on a belief in God. Judaism is a historical attachment; it is a set
of values, a music and a poetry, a collection of fables and
commentaries that make up a magnificently rich literature on
virtually every human situation.
</P>
<P>
   Not least, Jewish attachment is an unwillingness to forsake an
identity for which ancestors were persecuted and murdered. For many
Jews today, observance of rituals and holidays is less a matter of
divine commandment than it is an act of association, something that
gives form to their sense of belonging to a people and to a
history.
</P>
<P>
   One wonders exactly where these people stand in Klinghoffer's
Orthodox universe.

PETE WILSON: A ONCE AND FUTURE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Gov. Pete Wilson sits at a long table in
the Ronald Reagan Conference Room just outside his private office,
thinking about the former two-term California governor who would
become president.
</P>
<P>
   In less than a month, Wilson will be renting space in Reagan's
Century City office. He is beginning what likely will be a long
year of dialing for dollars and attempting to find a voice among
the field of potential Republican presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I think it's interesting,'' said Wilson, a portrait of
Reagan hanging behind him. ``I have identically the same approval
rating as Ronald Reagan when he left the office of governor. And I
think those who approved of him did so because they thought he
fought for principle. That's what I've tried to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Californians may feel the same way they did about an outgoing
Reagan as they do the departing Wilson, but repeating Reagan's
later success on the presidential campaign trail is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   If he decides to run, Wilson faces expensive, grueling campaigns
in states that hardly know him, and rivals that could include Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, former Vice President Dan Quayle, millionaire
publisher Steve Forbes, former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander and
former vice presidential nominee Jack Kemp.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson also leaves the state with a Republican Party weakened by
recent elections. Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, roundly defeated
Republican Dan Lungren in the Nov. 3 election to succeed Wilson,
who was barred by law from seeking a third term. (Reagan, too, was
succeeded by a Democrat _ Jerry Brown _ and the Democrats were as
strong as ever in the Legislature.)
</P>
<P>
   Wilson takes no blame for the spectacular, 20-point defeat of
Lungren, although Wilson did spend eight years antagonizing trade
unions and other interests that worked tirelessly against Lungren.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's embarrassing and brief run for president in 1995 _ a
move Wilson said he regretted _ and his own national party could
haunt him. Even though voters in November appeared to pick
moderate, pragmatic candidates, Wilson faces a Republican primary
system that favors conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem essentially for Pete is fundamental,'' said
Democratic strategist Bill Carrick. ``The Republican Party is more
conservative at its base than he is, by a long shot. ... He's just
a square peg in a round hole in the Republican primary process.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, 65, has not announced he is a candidate for president in
2000. Most of the political establishment expects the former U.S.
senator to enter the race, provided he can raise at least $15
million in 1999 and build his name recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson gave his potential campaign a boost this year, when he
signed a law moving California's presidential primary to March,
which will force candidates to campaign simultaneously in New York,
New Jersey and California. That can help Wilson, who already has an
organization and high name recognition here.
</P>
<P>
   After Wilson moves out of Sacramento and into his rented Century
City office, he plans to run a nonprofit advocacy group, the Bear
Flag Forum, which he recently established to promote his
educational and policy agendas. He may write a book or a newspaper
column.
</P>
<P>
   But fund-raising will undoubtedly be his most important task.
Wilson has not opened a federal presidential account or formed a
political action committee to accept donations, as have Forbes,
Quayle, Alexander, Kemp and others.
</P>
<P>
   But if and when Wilson does start accepting donations, he has a
rich donor list from 32 years in politics, but he must convince
them and hundreds of Republicans nationwide that he is a viable
national candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he knows it's going to be difficult,'' Republican
strategist Ken Khachigian said, ``and it's going to be even more
difficult because he's not a sitting governor. There are going to
be a lot of people who are not going to be as responsive as they
would have been. I think he'll find out in the first 90 days of
1999 if it's going to happen.''

 &HT;    Ornamental cookies give tree some class
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It never occurred to me to be sensitive about my
tradition of tacky Christmas trees. A misshapen pine or cedar from
the woods was as dear to my heart as the finest, most symmetrical
spruce imported from New England and sold at great price. And I
scorned electric lights and store-bought ornaments _ this to the
consternation of the children in the family who love bubbly,
on-and-off lights and a lot of sprayed-on snow.
</P>
<P>
   They decided to be tolerant after many years, telling one
another wisely that a taste for tacky Christmas trees was just one
of my foibles and easy to forgive. Loving them, I made a few
concessions, putting up the tree earlier than I like and leaving
off paper chains made from the colored pages in the Sears catalog.
</P>
<P>
   This year I have been vindicated. I gave the children the
strings

   BELLSOUTH-Q&AMP;A _ ATLANTA _ Q&AMP;A with Mark Feidler, president of
BellSouth's wireless division. What about the coverage controversy?
Is there room in the market for Sprint? What's happening to

Common Services Committee of the Atlanta Year 2000 Users Group,
Fisher and public relations man George Goodwim are scouting for

(Chambers, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   BEAZERHOMES _ Profile of Beazer Homes. It has no intention of
getting caught in a downturn. Just in case one happens next year,
the Atlanta-based builder is fine tuning a strategy that includes
gaining market share through acquisition; taking short-term options
on land rather than risking ownership; exploring niche markets;
avoiding duplications of competitors' products; and rewarding
employees for saving money internally. That sits well with analysts
such as David Dwyer of Salomon Smith Barney. He believes that
consolidations will overcome the effects of a 1999 slowdown,
assuming market fundamentals like interest rates and inventories
stay low and buyer commitments stay high. Beazer Homes' share price
has jumped nearly 50 percent during the past six weeks. When
stockholders receive their 1998 annual reports within the next few
days. (Harte, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   MONEYTALK _ Over 25 years _ which includes the Grinch years of
1973-74, 1981, 1987 and others _ returns have averaged 13.1
percent. Take it back through 1926, and the record shows that
stocks will return 11 percent a year. The lesson: Santa Claus is
fun, but Wall Street is real. (Ezell, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

 &HT;    For some, airline food never tasted so good
 &HT;    By Jeffry Scott
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ She's doing what couldn't be done by flashy
advertising campaigns or famous chef-consultants. Susan Powell is
making airline food look good.
</P>
<P>
   It all started as a dream four years ago when Powell, 41, an
Atlanta flight attendant for Delta Air Lines, realized the airline
was throwing away huge amounts of food left over from in-flight
snacks.
</P>
<P>
   Today, thanks to her persistence, Delta flight attendants
voluntarily collect a ton of packaged airline food a week for the
Atlanta Food Bank. And thousands of pounds more of muffins,
crackers, chips, cereal and peanuts go to food banks in 12 other
Delta cities. Other airlines, such as American and Continental, are
trying similar giveaways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the stuff we're getting is healthy,'' says Jane
Hayden, associate project director for Atlanta's Table, a project
of the Atlanta Food Bank, which collects and distributes donated
food to the city's low-flying poor and homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peanuts are good for you and the muffins are low-fat. And the
cereal, the way it's designed is perfect. Just take off the top and
pour in milk.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, says Hayden, the Delta snacks _ maybe sniffed at by
passengers _ find their way into bag lunches at the Atlanta Union
Mission.
</P>
<P>
   The idea wasn't Powell's. But she's the one who gave it wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flight attendants have been talking for years about what a
shame it is we throw away so much food,'' says Powell, who has been
with Delta since 1979. ``But Delta was reluctant to give the food
away because the company was worried about liability.''
</P>
<P>
   One day, between flights, Powell was watching CNN and saw that
President Bill Clinton had signed a federal good Samaritan law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It clicked in my head,'' she says. ``The next day I approached
Delta executives again with the proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives signed off. So did the Delta legal department. Powell
spearheaded a pilot program in Atlanta, which began in April 1997.
Six months later, the airline expanded the program to 12 other
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Powell continues to lead Delta's program, trying to enlist all
of the airline's 19,000 flight attendants in the cause.
</P>
<P>
   During National Food Bank week in October, she organized pep
rallies around the country to promote the idea at other Delta hubs.
</P>
<P>
   What's been especially encouraging, she says, is the support
from passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we announce on the P.A. that we'll be collecting
leftover, unopened food for donation to food banks, you can hear
rustling in the cabin, people taking muffins out of their
briefcases.''
</P>

 &HT;    WSB taking Boortz and Howard national
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Is the rest of America ready for Neal Boortz and Clark
Howard? WSB(AM750) thinks so.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Jan. 4, Atlanta's two top-rated radio talk hosts will
be dishing out opinion and advice in other parts of the country as
WSB officially launches its new radio syndication network _
starring none other than Boortz and Howard.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what that means: The two will still do their shows from
Atlanta, same time (Boortz/8:30 a.m.-noon, Howard/3-6 p.m.
weekdays), same place (WSB's new studios on West Peachtree St.,
Atlanta). But for two hours each day, radio stations in other parts
of the country will air portions of the shows while the talk hosts
field calls from Atlanta and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   How will folks react outside our hometown?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the big question,'' Boortz says in his trademark,
debate-team voice. ``Next year, I have been doing this nonsense 30
years in Atlanta. These people (in Atlanta) are used to me. I can
commit all sorts of high crimes and misdemeanors, and they say
'that's just Boortz.' But in Duluth (Minn.)? Stations might want to
take out an insurance policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The talk host does point to one factor that might work in his
favor when it comes to joining Rush Limbaugh and G. Gordon Liddy in
the arena of national political jabber: ``Name one Libertarian who
is a nationally syndicated talk host. There isn't one,'' Boortz
says. ``I am an equal opportunity offender.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard has a head start. WSB has been providing his show to
other Cox radio stations since last February, including WHIO in
Dayton and WDBO in Orlando. The consumer adviser has taken his show
live to these cities, where he is apparently building an
enthusiastic audience. According to WSB general manager Marc
Morgan, Howard has increased WDBO's audience by 140 percent since
the show began airing in Orlando. Howard has also been picked up by
stations in Milwaukee, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Dayton, Tulsa and
Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   The top-rated consumer adviser looks at the opportunity with his
usual, aw-shucks perspective. ``I have no idea what to expect, but
so far I'm thrilled,'' he says. ``I've not gotten any cracks on my
accent. . . . It really hasn't been nearly as hard as thought it
would be. The questions are so similar to what I'm used to. The
only hard part has been when somebody is dealing with something
where the rules may be different in their state.''
</P>
<P>
   (WSB radio is controlled by Atlanta-based Cox Enterprises Inc.,
which also owns The Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   THEY'RE COVER BOYS: Not many of us would want to appear on the
cover of the gay issues newspaper Southern Voice being accused of
homophobia. Neither did 96rock's new morning team known as the
Regular Guys (Larry Wachs and Eric Haessler). In the Dec. 10
edition of the publication, representatives from the media watchdog
group the Gay &AMP; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation blasted the
team for homophobic remarks, including one bit in which the Regular
Guys allegedly suggested that parents keep their children away from
gay hairdressers. ``I was angry, really mad and offended when I saw
it,'' Haessler says. ``It's okay with me if they write a review of
the show every week that says it's terrible or not funny, but it's
wrong to say I'm anti-gay, because I'm not.'' Haessler and
WKLS(96rock) program director Pat Ervin conceded the Regular Guys
have used terms such as ``faggot'' on the air, but that ``it wasn't
cruel, it was a joke.'' Since they made their debut June 15, the
Regular Guys have brought an aggressive, in-your-face approach to
morning radio that is definitely a departure from the genteel
South. Their schtick is bawdy, irreverent humor that skewers
everyone, from women to blacks to Jews to bald guys. Do they go too
far? Ratings will tell.

NEWFANGLED LATKES: HOLD THE POTATO

<P>
   ``I am bored with latkes,'' said Celia Regev, an Israeli chef
living in Maryland, daring to say what many Jews start to think at
this time of year. Though the popularity of latkes, the potato
pancakes cooked at Hanukkah, is by no means waning, even the most
die-hard latke lover needs a change halfway through the eight-day
festival, which began Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A new generation of cooks is up to the challenge, using a
variety of vegetables and toppings in pancakes that respect the
tried-and-true form in every way but one: They are not made of
potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many ways can you grate a potato?'' asked Israel Aharoni,
the chef and owner of the Tipuach Zahav (Golden Apple) restaurant
in Tel Aviv and a food columnist for Yediot Aharonot, a daily
newspaper there. ``Although I love all kinds of potato pancakes, I
am for variation.''
</P>
<P>
   At a gala dinner in Washington earlier this year celebrating the
50th anniversary of Israel, Aharoni prepared pint-size leek patties
as hors d'oeuvres. ``I got the idea for this from a traditional
Sephardic leek patty from the Balkans usually served at Passover,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Regev, who teaches at L'Academie de Cuisine in Bethesda,
Md., and who is married to an Israeli diplomat in Washington, says
that when cooking her holiday meals, she looks for ``things that I
find a little bit more exciting, and still fit within the holiday
tradition of cooking with oil.''
</P>
<P>
   A patty fried in oil represents the miracle of Hanukkah, in
which a small vial of oil burned for eight days in the Temple in
Jerusalem after it had been devastated by the Assyrians in 165 B.C.
Mrs. Regev, who noted that in Hebrew latkes are called levivot,
makes hers from lentils and serves them with labneh, a strained
yogurt, and a confit of onions.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Regev's version of the latke might actually resemble the
fried pancakes made centuries ago from lentils, barley or flour.
Potatoes were not commonly used until the late 17th or early 18th
century, when they arrived in Europe from the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Eastern Europe, Jews added potatoes,'' said Zalman Shoval,
Israel's ambassador to the United States. ``Potatoes are what
Jewish people could afford in Russia because potatoes were the
cheapest sort of food.''
</P>
<P>
   Hava Volman, an Israeli caterer who now lives in Brooklyn, has
created several latkes that have fused many cultures. ``My American
customers want something different, so I tried sweet potatoes, and
that didn't work,'' she said. ``Nor did zucchini _ it wasn't tasty
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   But her experiments with American corn paid off, as did playing
with ingredients from local Asian and Hispanic markets. Ms. Volman,
whose company is called Hava's Kitchen, now makes a colorful corn
latke with a chipotle topping, as well as a mushroom pecan latke
that she tops with smoked salmon and pickled ginger.
</P>
<P>
   These newfangled ways of preparing latkes are not without
controversy, of course. Shoval, a potato latke purist, believes
that ``you can be creative, but then you are not making latkes
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the bold cooks persist, bravely tempting today's palates
with modern, yet biblical interpretations. &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Bitterly cold air will continue to amass over Alaska and
northwestern Canada. However, much of the contiguous United States
will continue to have temperatures near or above the seasonal
average. Meanwhile, an unusually dry pattern will prevail across
the nation as a ridge of high pressure remains strong from the
Western States to the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds will gather over the Great Lakes and interior Northeast
as a flow of chilly air in the wake of a front draws moisture as it
passes over the warmer lake water. A few snow showers will occur
near the northern Great Lakes. The coastal Northeast will remain
partly to mostly sunny with afternoon temperatures several degrees
above normal.
</P>
<P>
   Morning clouds and patchy rain will occur near the Carolina
coast. Gradual clearing will occur in the afternoon as low pressure
moves offshore. Elsewhere in the Southeast, mainly sunny and mild
conditions will prevail, although cooler air will arrive from the
north late Wednesday and Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Abundant sunshine will cover a large area from the interior West
to the Plains. High clouds will dim the sun from the northern
Rockies to the northern Plains. Thicker clouds and a few snow
showers will occur along west-facing slopes in western Montana and
Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   The West Coast States will be mainly dry. Gusty winds from the
northeast will persist in California, especially near mountain
passes in the south. Near record heat will occur in some coastal
areas as the offshore winds are further warmed as they descend from
the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Focus: Snowy Kodiak &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Eleven inches of snow fell at Kodiak, Alaska, on Monday,
smashing the date's long-standing record of 2.8 inches set in 1935.
The town's average snowfall for December is 13 inches, while the
annual average is close to 78 inches. But the measurement of snow
is often difficult, given the fierce winds that are generated by
intense low pressure systems over western Gulf of Alaska.
Snowflakes caught in strong winds near the surface move
horizontally, making them difficult to capture in a precipitation
gauge. On Monday, much of Kodiak's snow fell with winds between 20
and 40 miles an hour.

   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Carlos Saura's latest dance-inspired film,
``Tango,'' continues the great Spanish director's fascination with
how life, art and memory intermingle, and how that can be expressed
through a self-conscious display of cinema, music and movement.
</P>
<P>
   Set, for the most part, in a Buenos Aires film studio where an
ambitious tango picture is being prepared, the movie about making
the movie is as artful and passionate a work as its rich subject
demands. Saura brilliantly shows how both the choreography and the
director Mario's (Miguel Angel Sola) personal vision of the piece
grows through a demanding rehearsal period, while peppering the
piece with wonderful (illusion-or-reality?) tricks.
</P>
<P>
   Political points (Mario wants to include a harrowing number that
addresses Argentina's recent military dictatorship) and show-biz
problems (his producers don't want anything that dark and dangerous
threatening the project's commercial prospects) are deftly brought
into play. A May-December love affair that develops between Mario
and the young dancer Elena (Mia Maestro), who is the girlfriend of
a mobster who's the movie's primary investor, plays somewhat more
hackneyed.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, all of these influences result in glorious,
thrilling dancing, all bracingly accompanied by Lalo Schifrin's
(``Mission: Impossible'') intricate score and Vittorio Storaro's
(``Apocalypse Now,'' ``The Last Emperor'') gorgeous and inventive
cinematography.
</P>
<P>
   Among the highlights, where all of these marvelous elements come
together, are fanciful ballets that interpret key aspects of
Argentine history. These include an immigrant landing built around
a crime of passion, a gang war every bit as good as the ones in
``West Side Story'' (and featuring the rare, sublime experience of
ballet star Julio Bocca dancing the woman's part) and, most
impressive, that controversial, multiscene tribute to the
disappeared victims of the generals' regime.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Saura's recent work _ ``Blood Wedding,'' ``Carmen,''
``El amor brujo,'' ``Flamenco,'' ``Ay, Carmela!'' _ has leaned on
the old ``Shakespeare in Love'' gimmick, where backstage melodrama
bobs and weaves with the themes of the show being staged. The
concept is kind of rickety, but as long as it inspires work as
vibrant as ``Tango,'' there's obviously still abundant life in the
old idea.

   LOS ANGELES _ There are plenty of new and old videos out there
that make great gifts this holiday season, and with the addition of
some terrific DVD titles you won't have to be held hostage to the
current dreadful network television season. Most of these titles
can be found at local stores like Best Buy, Circuit City and Fry's,
but for the more esoteric or high-end ones you can find them online
at sites like reel.com, amazon.com or videocollection.com. Either
online or in stores, you can also expect most of these titles to be
discounted, some by as much as 50 percent. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
DVD &QC;
</P>
<P>
   With the studios digging into their vaults, there is more and
more to choose from everyday; so we'll pick five somewhat
representative titles that have been released recently to show the
range of what's available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Casablanca'' (MGM; $24.99), which won the 1942 Oscar for best
picture and was named No. 2 on the American Film Institute's
all-time list, will appeal to just about everyone. Included on this
DVD is the fascinating documentary ``You Must Remember This,''
hosted by Lauren Bacall and containing some unseen footage. The
documentary explains what can only be described as the happy
accident in the making of the film (there were four screenwriters
and numerous script changes). It also clears up some things. The
famous airport scene was shot on a soundstage, although the plane's
takeoff may have been filmed at a local airport. When you see
Humphrey Bogart tell Ingrid Bergman that he's staying behind,
that's a cutout airplane in the background with midgets playing
workmen to give the scene perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Silence of the Lambs'' (Orion; $24.99), which won the 1990
Oscar for Best Picture, is one of the most chilling films ever
made. The DVD includes audio commentary from director Jonathan
Demme and stars Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster, all Oscar
winners. It also has seven deleted scenes, a film-to-storyboard
comparison and other features.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bull Durham'' (Orion; $24.99) may not have won any Academy
Awards, but this 1990 romantic comedy about a love triangle between
a career minor leaguer, a hotshot rookie prospect and the team
groupie/guru has plenty of laughs and sex appeal with Kevin
Costner, Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon in the respective roles.
The DVD includes an audio commentary by director/writer Ron
Shelton, who explains how he solved such problems as getting the
6-foot-5-inch Robbins standing on a pitching mound and the 5-foot-6
Sarandon in the same frame.
</P>
<P>
   This year's ``Lost in Space'' (New Line; $24.99) is included
here because it merges DVD technology with the computer. The DVD of
this fun sci-fi adventure contains two audio commentaries, deleted
scenes and featurettes on space travel and special effects,
synopses of all the original TV episodes, interviews with original
cast members, and for computer users with DVD ROM there are games,
trivia, other interactive content and a Web site to jump to.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Tomorrow Never Dies Special Edition'' (MGM; $34.99) is a
treat for James Bond fans. The DVD includes a 45-minute documentary
on the evolution of the most-successful film series ever, including
interviews with Sean Connery and others involved, plus commentary
from the director and stunt coordinator, Sheryl Crow's video of the
theme song and other features. Hong Kong martial arts star Michelle
Yeoh helps pump life into the 1997 film, which stars Pierce Bronson
as the latest Bond and has some spectacular special effects and
stunts. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
VIDEO &QC;
</P>
<P>
   For something slightly different, you can get the ``Tomorrow
Never Dies Limited Edition'' (MGM; $39.99) on VHS. This version
includes a second video, ``The Highly Classified World of 007,''
hosted by Desmond Llewelyn, who plays Q, a copy of the final
shooting script and a set of photo cards.
</P>
<P>
   It's never too early to get into the end-of-the-century madness,
and Paramount Pictures has 10 of their top films in one pack, the
Millennium Collection (Paramount; $189.50). All the films,
including ``Breakfast at Tiffany's'' for the first time, are
presented in a wide-screen format. The collection includes five
Best Picture Oscar winners and films that took home an additional
33 Academy Awards. The pack features collector gift cards and a
booklet detailing the productions of all 10 films. Besides
``Tiffany's,'' starring a luminous Audrey Hepburn, the collection
contains: ``The Ten Commandments'' with Charlton Heston, ``Grease''
with John Travolta, Francis Ford Coppola's ``Apocalypse Now'' and
``The Godfather,'' the whale-saving ``Star Trek IV _ The Voyage
Home,'' Tom Cruise's hit ``Top Gun,'' the romantic ``Ghost'' with
Demi Moore, Mel Gibson's Celtic epic ``Braveheart'' and ``Forrest
Gump'' with Tom Hanks.
</P>
<P>
   The 75th Anniversary Box-Office Superstars Collection (Warners;
$69.92) includes four hit films _ ``Batman,'' ``Gremlins,''
Twister'' and ``Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves'' _ plus ``The Warner
Story: No Guts, No Glory,'' a documentary on the history of the
storied studio.
</P>
<P>
   The restored version of ``Gone With the Wind'' (MGM; $26.95) may
be the all-time box-office champ when it comes to the number of
tickets sold. Nearly four hours in length, the 1939 winner of 10
Academy Awards may seem dated and even offensive by today's
standards but remains a monument to old-time Hollywood filmmaking
for those who give a damn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Frank Sinatra Collection,'' (MGM; $29.99) captures Ol'
Blue Eyes in some of his best musicals _ ``High Society'' (with
Bing Crosby and Grace Kelly), ``Anchors Aweigh'' (with Gene Kelly
and Kathryn Grayson) and ``On the Town'' (with Gene Kelly and Betty
Garrett).
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pam Grier Collection'' (Orion; $34.99) should excite fans
of the blaxploitation queen. Grier, who should be a bigger star in
Hollywood (what more do you need besides looks, talent and a
dynamic screen presence?), can be seen currently on the Showtime
series ``Linc's.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My So-Called Life Collection'' (BMG; $39.98) includes three
videos (six episodes) of the cult series that starred Claire Danes
as a teen-age girl dealing with the pressures of high school.
</P>
<P>
   If George Miller's ``Babe: Pig in the City'' seems a bit dark as
a children's film, you may want to check out where he got his start
with the Mad Max Collection'' (Warners; $34.99). The special boxed
set contains the original ``Mad Max'' along with ``The Road
Warrior'' and ``Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome'' (notice the pigs).
Science-fiction and action fans will love this dark vision.
</P>
<P>
   If you missed some of the impressive productions on the A&AMP;E
network, you can catch up to them on video. If you're still seasick
for the ``Titanic,'' the 1994 documentary ($39.99) combines rare
footage, archival documents and photos, creative presentation and
eyewitness accounts to explore the creation of the ``unsinkable''
ocean liner and its fateful maiden voyage across the Atlantic in
1912. For fans of the sophisticated '60s television series ``The
Avengers,'' starring Diana Rigg and Patrick Macnee, there are three
box sets ($29.99 each), with six episodes per set. For the literary
minded, there's Thomas Hardy's ``Tess of the D'Urbervilles''
($29.99), which aired in September.
</P>
<P>
   PBS Home Video has three excellent documentaries from Ken Burns,
the master of historical filmmaking. ``Thomas Jefferson,'' ``Lewis
&AMP; Clark'' and ``Frank Lloyd Wright'' each contain two videos and
are priced at $29.98 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   BBC Video offers a number of interesting box sets, including
``Sister Wendy's Grand Tour'' ($19.95) in which the unlikely art
historian Sister Wendy Beckett tours the great museums of Europe.
Her enthusiasm somehow makes it all entertaining. ``Sister Wendy's
Story of Painting Gift Set'' ($99.99) is also available. And don't
forget ``Absolutely Fabulous: AbFab Moments'' ($19.99). The video
is a hilarious compilation of highlights from the cult British
comedy series, starring Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley, about
two outrageously self-indulgent women.
</P>
<P>
   PolyGram has a couple of interesting musical offerings. Andrew
Lloyd Webber's ``Cats'' is inventively brought to video with a new
production, and fans of Michael ``Lord of the Dance'' Flatley can
catch him in ``Feet of Flames.'' Each goes for $24.95.
</P>
<P>
   For the little ones, ``Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,''
``Frosty the Snowman'' and ``The Little Drummer Boy'' are available
from the video division of Golden Books for $12.98 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack Parr: As I Was Saying ...'' (White Star; $49.95) looks at
television's pioneering late-night host. Included in the
three-video pack are Parr's interviews with John F. Kennedy, Judy
Garland, Richard Nixon and the acerbic Oscar Levant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Planet of the Apes: The 30th Anniversary Collection'' (Fox;
$49.95) features all five ``Apes'' epics with restored prints and
remastered THX soundtracks.
</P>
<P>
   For X-philers, there's ``The X-Files: The Movie Collector's
Set'' (Fox; $79.99 ). It includes a wide-screen edition of the
film, a special ``Making of the X-Files'' video containing
interviews with the director, the stars and creator Chris Carter;
three reproductions of the movie's poster art; a 128-page
collector's book about the film; the script of the film; and a
specially mounted strip of five frames from one of the theatrical
prints.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there are two personal favorites, both BBC productions.
``I, Claudius'' ($129.98), based on Robert Graves' novel of Rome,
is a story of conspiracy, sexuality and corruption that makes ``The
Godfather'' look like schoolboy high jinks. Claudius, emperor of
Rome, nears the end of his life and writes his family's history.
The extraordinary memoir begins before his birth and traces an epic
of ruthless ambition, shocking debauchery and murderous intrigue
set against one of history's most fascinating eras. Claudius, the
stammering and half-lame grandson of the scheming empress Livia,
survives amid corruption and deceit by playing the fool. Starring
Derek Jacobi (Claudius), Sian Phillips, John Hurt, Patrick Stewart,
Brian Blessed and a host of distinguished actors, this special
edition features scenes omitted from the original public-television
broadcast. Also included is the famed 70-minute documentary, ``The
Epic That Never Was,'' about the ill-fated 1937 film version of
``I, Claudius'' that starred Charles Laughton and Merle Oberon. The
only place you're likely to find this magnificent seven-video set
is videocollection.com. ``Brideshead Revisited'' ($119.95) tells
the story of the difficult loves of insular Englishman Charles
Ryder (Jeremy Irons), and his peculiarly intense relationship with
the wealthy but dysfunctional Roman Catholic family that inhabited
Brideshead, a grand country manor. Based on Evelyn Waugh's 1945
novel, ``Brideshead'' is also a story of faith as each member of
the Marchmain family must confront his or her relationship with the
church. Anthony Andrews and the incomparable Claire Bloom also
star. The box set is offered at all three Web sites mentioned.

   LOS ANGELES _ Except for those who like living on the edge,
holiday shopping can be one of the most stressful endeavors in
life. For most men, it's even worse _ sort of on par with watching
their favorite team lose the Super Bowl for the fourth straight
time. But wandering through a bookstore such as Dutton's in North
Hollywood or a Barnes &AMP; Noble or any other one is a Zen-like
experience guaranteed to bring back some of your equilibrium. Even
if you go with the intention of picking up one of the titles listed
below, take some time out to wander among the aisles, pick up the
books, turn the pages and get lost in something other than the
madness. Of course, you can go online to places like amazon.com or
barnesandnoble.com, but the experience is nowhere near as
therapeutic. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
BEST BETS &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``The American Century,'' by Harold Evans (Knopf; $50). It's not
surprising that this book is out there; with the millennium
approaching, there are already countless tomes dedicated to the
past century or even the last 1,000 years. What Evans does to make
``The American Century'' surprising is choose lesser-known archival
photographs and stories to illustrate the major events of the last
100 years. In it, there is a telling picture of John F. Kennedy and
Lyndon Johnson taken while they were campaigning in the 1960
election. In it LBJ is gesturing and shouting wildly at an unseen
plane to shut its engine down while JFK reaches over to restrain
him. The photo is obviously meant to contrast their political
styles, but as as you move farther in the book to a section on the
Vietnam War, the picture takes on a different meaning. Johnson, as
Evans points out, had his doubts about the war but did not want
America to be humbled by a ``damn little pissant country.'' You can
only wonder if the more restrained Kennedy would have taken a
different course. It's items like this that make ``Century''
fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Van Gogh's Van Goghs,'' by Richard Kendall (National Gallery
of Art/Abrams; $37.50). This book is the companion to the exhibit
of the Dutch painter's work that will be at the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art in January. The book contains glossy reproductions of
the 70 masterpieces from the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam that will
be on display. The collection encompasses all aspects of the
artist's career, including such famed works as ``The Potato
Eaters,'' ``The Bedroom,'' ``Self Portrait as an Artist,'' ``The
Harvest'' and ``Wheatfield With Crows.'' This handsome tome also
includes discussions of each work. A can't-miss for art lovers,
especially those thousands who already have bought tickets to the
LACMA exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ART BOOKS &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``Jackson Pollock'' by Kirk Varnedoe with Pepe Karmel. (Museum
of Modern Art, New York/distributed by Harry N. Abrams; $75.) This
is the accompanying volume to the current major Pollock exhibition
at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. It includes more than 200
color reproductions of the pioneering abstract expressionist works.
For those who only see Pollock as the man who created ``drip
paintings,'' this volume helps explain his radical experiments,
which were attempts to free himself from the formal concerns of his
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``A World History of Art'' (DK; $59.95). This 720-page volume's
survey of art ranges prehistoric to contemporary. It also
acknowledges works from non-Western cultures, including Oceania
regions and Africa. The color reproduction are sharp. The last
chapter, ``The Future of Art,'' attempts to predict directions the
art world may take. It's a solid general reference book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Louvre: Portrait of a Museum,'' by Nicholas d'Archimbaud
(Stewart, Tabori &AMP; Chang; $60). The famed Paris museum was built as
a fortress in 1190, expanded into a palace, then became a museum in
1792 after the fall of the monarchy. This volume, conceived and
photographed by d'Archimbaud, traces the Louvre's history and shows
off its many treasures and architecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Essential'' series are mini-books measuring 6 by 6 inches.
The first four titles are ``Jackson Pollock,'' ``Salvador Dali,''
``Edward Hopper'' and ``Vincent Van Gogh'' (Abrams; $12.95 each).
These small volumes give you quick and simple references to the
artists and make it easy for you to sound like you know something
when you're at a museum. Did you know that Van Gogh used a reed pen
to draw with because of his admiration for Rembrandt, who used one
200 years before, and that he thought the Japanese tool exotic. An
icebreaker if I ever heard one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Prince of Egypt: a New Vision in Animation,'' by Charles
Solomon (Abrams; $45). The title is the hype that you would expect
to be associated with the highly promoted new film on the biblical
story of Moses from DreamWorks. But those who have seen the film
know that much of the animation is stunning, and this book, besides
glossily reproducing frames from ``Prince,'' also explains its
complex and occasionally computerized animation process in detail.
Much of the rest of the text is typical movie fluff that can be
overlooked. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
ENTERTAINMENT &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``It Happened on Broadway: an Oral History of the Great White
Way,'' by Myrna Katz Frommer and Harvey Frommer (Harcourt Brace;
$35). Included in this volume are stories, anecdotes, jokes,
recollections and love letters from more than 100 theater
professionals _ actors, directors, playwrights, composers and
choreographers _ who talk about the past 60 years of theater.
Illustrated with more than 100 black-and-white photos, such
luminaries as Celeste Holm, John Raitt, Marge Champion, Richard
Kiley, Leslie Uggams and Neil Simon share their memories of the
Great White Way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Story of Opera,'' by Richard Somerset-Ward (Abrams;
$49.50). The former head of music and arts programming for BBC
Television has put together a readable and elegant reference work
on opera, from its origins in the 16th century to today. It
includes chapters on the great Italian, German, French, English and
Russian operas and a brief introduction by diva Kiri Te Kanawa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars: the Visual Dictionary'' and ``Star Wars: Incredible
Cross Sections'' (DK; $19.95 each). Excitement already is building
for the new ``Star Wars'' installment, ``The Phantom Menace,'' set
for May, but there is still plenty out there for fans of the first
three movies. These two volumes are at the low end price-wise, but
for those who want something more substantial, there's the ``Star
Wars Encyclopedia'' by Stephen J. Sansweet (Del Rey; $49.95), which
has hundreds of entries, or ``Star Wars Masterpiece Edition''
(Chronicle; $75), which traces the history of Darth Vader from
before the trilogy and comes with an action figure of the villain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlton Heston's Hollywood,'' by Charlton Heston (GT; $28).
The man who played Moses and Michelangelo looks at his 50 years in
film. The volume includes more than 200 photos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bruce Springsteen: Songs,'' by Bruce Springsteen (Avon Books;
$50). The ultimate for fans of the Boss. This volume contains the
complete collection of Springsteen's recorded album lyrics over 25
years, as well as the rock star's discussion of his inspirations
and his relationship with his audience and the role music has
played in his life. ``Songs'' includes reproductions of handwritten
sheets, on which he drafted songs, and numerous photos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Superman: The Complete History,'' by Les Daniels (Chronicle;
$29.95). A look at the history of the Man of Steel, from his birth
as a comic-book hero in the '30s to his TV and movies years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Great Rock Discography,'' by Martin C. Strong (Times
Books; $32). Comprehensive listings for music trivia buffs. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SPACE &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``NASA and the Exploration of Space,'' by Roger D. Launius and
Bertram Ulrich (Stewart, Tabori &AMP; Chang; $60). This volume tells
the story of United States space exploration with paintings and
sketches from from the art collection of the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration. Among the artists are Peter Hurd, Jamie
Wyeth, Robert Rauschenberg, Robert McCall and Norman Rockwell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apollo: An Eyewitness Account by Astronaut/Explorer
Artist/Moonwalker Alan Bean,'' by Alan Bean with Andrew Chaikin
(The Greenwich Workshop Press; $45). The fourth man to walk on the
moon tells his story through his painting. Includes an introduction
by another space hero, Sen. John Glenn. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
HISTORY &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Illustrated Longitude,'' by Dava Sobel and William J.H.
Andrews (Walker; $32.95). This is the expanded version of Sobel's
critically acclaimed ``Longitude'' that tells the story of John
Harrison ``who solved the greatest scientific problem of his time''
by building a clock that kept precise time at sea (a chronometer).
The illustrations, photos and maps are a welcome addition to
Sobel's lively prose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lewis &AMP; Clark: Voyage of Discovery,'' by Stephen Ambrose,
photos by Sam Abell (National Geographic Society; $40). This book
retraces the explorers' expedition to open the American West. Noted
historian Ambrose retraced their footsteps 190 years later, and
Abell took some grand photos. The volume also includes dozens of
reproductions of historic photos, paintings and maps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lost Ships: The Discovery and Exploration of the Ocean's
Sunken Treasures,'' by Mensun Bound (Simon &AMP; Schuster Editions;
$35). Bound, a professor of marine archeology at Oxford University,
is both a diver and art historian, so many of his stories are
personal encounters with the shipwrecks. A fascinating account that
includes historic photos and illustrations as well as shots of the
ships' underwater graves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Endurance: Shackleton's Legendary Antarctic Expedition,''
by Caroline Alexander (Knopf; $29.95). Alexander tells the
compelling story of British explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton's doom
expedition to the South Pole. Among the crew was photographer Frank
Hurley, who took some startling shots of the men's ordeal that are
used to illustrate this book.
</P>
<P>
   ``America 1900: The Turning Point,'' by Judy Crichton (Henry
Holt; $29.95). This is the companion to the PBS documentary that
aired in November. It is a beautifully illustrated account of this
country as it moved into a new century. As we are about do so
again, the concerns of that time seem familiar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Death in Paradise: An Illustrated History of the Los Angeles
County Department of Coroner,'' by Tony Blanche and Brad Schreiber
(GPG; $24.95). A little macabre for the holidays perhaps, but this
behind-the-scenes look at some to the cases _ from the Black Dahlia
to the murder of Nicole Brown Simpson _ that have passed through
the L.A. County coroner's office is luridly engaging. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
PHOTOGRAPHY &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``Life Photographers: What They Saw,'' by John Loengard
(Bulfinch; $35). Starting with Alfred Eisenstaedt, Life magazine

GOOD SOUNDS COME IN SMALL PACKAGES

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER and GLENN WHIPP 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Two of music critics, Fred Shuster and Glenn
Whipp, put on their headphones and made their choices of some of
the best CD box sets out there. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
GLENN WHIPP'S PICKS &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Look of Love: The Burt Bacharach Collection'' (Rhino,
three CDs; $50) This box could also be subtitled ``Music Your
Parents Listened to and You Thought You Hated Until Just
Recently.'' Bacharach's richly melodic music has actually been a
guilty pleasure for years, well before lounge chic reared its boozy
head. The best stuff pairs Bacharach's inventive arrangements with
Hal David's incisive lyrics. For the cream of the crop, add Dionne
Warwick's breezy vocals. Adult pop doesn't get any better.
</P>
<P>
   John Coltrane, ``The Classic Quartet _ Complete Impulse! Studio
Recordings'' (Impulse!, eight CDs; $90) The best jazz box of the
year, this excellent set traces the compelling evolution of the
music the saxophone legend made with his most famous band _ pianist
McCoy Tyner, drummer Elvin Jones and bassist Jimmy Garrison. Few
working outfits ever had the kind of musical telepathy that this
trailblazing quartet possessed. For evidence, listen to the
transcendent ``A Love Supreme.'' Or the lyrically evocative
``Crescent.'' Or any of the seven unreleased outtakes (including a
fascinating alternate of the second movement of ``A Love Supreme'')
contained on the eighth disc. You will believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The John Lennon Anthology,'' (Capitol, four CDs; $73)
</P>
<P>
   Much like the three Beatles anthologies, the music contained in
this beautifully packaged box contains the sort of stuff _
alternate takes, demos, live recordings and goofy outtakes _ that
true believers will love. Everyone else will be better served by
the single-disc highlights collection Capitol released. But for
those who love the sound of Lennon's voice _ and it's front and
center here, more so than on his studio recordings _ this is a (No.
9) dream.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Springsteen, ``Tracks,'' (Columbia, four CDs; $70).
Springsteen decided to rejoin the Professor, Miami Steve, the Big
Man and the rest of the E Street Band cats on a tour next year, and
he probably made the call while assembling the music for this
exhilarating collection. Many of these rollicking unreleased songs
capture the wild, the innocent and sweat-stained shuffle of the
Boss's early days, when the sheer exuberance of his music made you
believe in the transforming power of rock 'n' roll. Crank up the
volume, roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have a Nice Decade: The '70s Pop Culture Box'' (Rhino, seven
CDs; $100) Talk about recovered memory. I've had the melody of a
song bouncing around my head for years, and only now, listening to
this wonderful collection, did I remember that it's the
Moog-synthesized stylings of Hot Butter and its No. 9 hit
``Popcorn.'' This entertaining set, appropriately housed in a
pea-green shag-carpet container, contains all the sing-along
one-hit wonders you could ask for (``Put Your Hand in the Hand,''
``Cat's in the Cradle'') along with funky dance tracks (``Disco
Inferno,'' ``Brick House'') and outright classics (``Let's Stay
Together''). Box provides ample evidence that one person's travesty
(say, ``Disco Duck'') is another's treasure.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Charles, ``The Complete Country &AMP; Western Recordings,
1959-1986'' (Rhino, four CDs; $50). Country and western. Rhythm and
blues. Soul. Swing. None of the labels matter. When Ray Charles
sings a song, it becomes a Ray Charles song. Period. This excellent
set collects all of Brother Ray's honky-tonk sides, including the
genre-busting ``Modern Sounds'' recordings and later duets with the
likes of Merle Haggard and Johnny Cash. The ``white man's blues,''
as Charles termed country music, have never sounded so good.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Newman, ``Guilty, 30 Years'' (Rhino/Reprise, four CDs;
$60). Newman receives a lot of critical respect because of his
sharp writing, keen ear and a knack for turning the unlikeliest of
subjects (Karl Marx, cultural imperialism) into pop ditties. His
Americana travelogue numbers _ there are songs here about
Baltimore, Birmingham, Cleveland, Omaha and, of course Los Angeles,
among many others _ are always evocative, and his work as a film
composer is unparalleled. So why hasn't he sold many records? Well,
his mushy drawl is an acquired taste, and his orchestrations can be
a little too Tin Pan Alley. Then, too, Americans might not ever be
ready for songs about political science. If you are, this sprawling
collection just might be for you.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Garland, ``Judy'' (32 Records, four CDs plus video; $80)
</P>
<P>
   This comprehensive box spans the tragic singer's career,
beginning with early recordings made when Garland was just 7 to a
heartbreaking, live rendition of ``Over the Rainbow'' taped shortly
before her death in 1969. There are several unreleased concert
duets with Tony Bennett, Peggy Lee and Barbra Streisand as well as
a nine-song video from Garland's 1960s variety show. The proverbial
pot of gold for Garland fans. &QL;

FRED SHUSTER'S PICKS &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``Miss Peggy Lee'' (EMI-Capitol, four CDs; $50) Every few years,
Peggy Lee is rediscovered _ most recently when Madonna covered
``Fever.'' Now with the popularity of lounge and swing music,
here's the definitive compilation for one of the most distinctive
big band and jazz singers in all of pop. This box, complete with
80-page booklet, collects 113 songs recorded during Lee's Capitol
career, including ``Fever,'' ``Big Spender'' and ``Why Don't You Do
Right?'' some never-before-released tracks and a handful of songs
reissued for the first time since they were available on 78s.
Incidentally, Lee's final hit, ``Is That All There Is?'' was
conducted by Randy Newman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Louis Armstrong: An American Icon'' (Hip-O, three CDs; $50)
He's considered the greatest jazz musician of all, a world
ambassador of America's liveliest homegrown art form and a true
original. Just ask Brian Setzer or Big Bad Voodoo Daddy _ Satchmo
was a king of swing. This 60-song set offers a comprehensive survey
of Armstrong's finest recordings of the post-World War II era, from
1946 to 1968. This was the period of his biggest successes, when he
went from jazz superstar to a goodwill symbol of American music and
culture. Here are the hits _ ``Hello Dolly!'' ``Mack the Knife,''
``What a Wonderful World'' _ plus duets with Ella Fitzgerald,
Billie Holiday, Bing Crosby and musical summit meetings with Duke
Ellington, Oscar Peterson and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blue Note Years'' (Blue Note, 14 CDs; $250). These 149
tracks represent a remarkably broad roster of talents reflecting
the stylistic developments in jazz over the past six decades,
featuring such revered artists as Miles Davis, John Coltrane,
Thelonious Monk, Bud Powell and every other jazzer you've ever
heard of. This seven-volume, 14-CD box, issued in advance of Blue
Note's 60th anniversary next month, is broken into such headings as
``Boogie, Blues and Bop (1939-55),'' ``The Jazz Message
(1955-60),'' ``Organ &AMP; Soul (1956-67)'' and ``Hard Bop &AMP; Beyond
(1963-67),'' right through ``Blue Note Now as Then,'' which
highlights '90s stars like Cassandra Wilson, Dianne Reeves and Joe
Lovano.
</P>
<P>
   ``Transistor Blast,'' XTC (TVT, four CDs; $45). One of the
cleverest Britpop bands to emerge from the punk and new wave
explosion of the late '70s, XTC was known for tense, syncopated
riffs and lushly arranged, hook-laden pop gems. Titled after a
lyric from the 1978 single, ``This Is Pop,'' the 52-track box set
features a treasure trove of tunes culled from BBC Radio vaults and
performance tapes. Highlights here include ``I'm Bugged,'' ``Life
Begins at the Hop,'' ``Generals and Majors,'' ``Making Plans for
Nigel'' and ``Science Friction.'' Incidentally, XTC's first new
record in seven years, ``Apple Venus Vol. 1,'' is due in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie Parker: The Complete Live Performances on Savoy''
(Denon, four CDs; $50). This compilation includes three discs
devoted to recordings of live gigs by the Parker quintet originally
broadcast from New York's Royal Roost nightclub in 1948-49. The
fourth disc includes six performances from a jam session featuring
alto sax genius Parker in Chicago in 1950, plus five tracks from a
1947 Carnegie Hall show with Dizzy Gillespie. Although this
material has been reissued in the past, this dizzyingly good
56-track set offers the best sound available and puts the spotlight
squarely on the remarkable Parker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time Is Tight,'' Booker T. &AMP; the MG's (Fantasy, three CDs;
$45). Although Hammond organist Booker T. gets his name in the
band's title, this marvelous Southern rhythm section could also
have been called Steve Cropper &AMP; the MG's. Guitarist Cropper is
equally crucial to the groove here and it's his simple yet sweet
fretwork that provides much of the tension in this terrific
compilation of mostly instrumental Stax Records classics like
``Green Onions,'' ``Hang 'Em High'' and ``Hip Hug-Her,'' plus more
recent work with Boz Scaggs and Neil Young.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tommy Boy's Greatest Beats (1981-96)'' (Tommy Boy, four CDs;
$70). While not sequenced chronologically, this 56-track, four-disc
set traces rap's history from Afrika Bambaataa to De La Soul to
Coolio and Naughty by Nature _ ``Planet Rock'' to ``Gangsta's
Paradise,'' in other words. The New York rap-dance label Tommy Boy
was there from the beginning, introducing urban space-funk, cheap
drum machines, electronic hand claps and turntable magic to the
masses. The four volumes here are available individually or in a
great packaging concept _ a mini replica of a plastic DJ crate.

   MIDEAST-CLINTON _ JERUSALEM _ Mixing powerful symbols of
historic sacrifice and seasonal hope, President Clinton wrapped up
a difficult visit to this turbulent region on Tuesday, conceding
that the heart of the imperiled Mideast peace process is barely
beating and faces added strains in the weeks ahead. Hoping to gird
that process for further stress, Clinton pulled Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
together for a 90-minute meeting at the border town of Erez, south
of the capital. Nothing of substance could be resolved, however,
and the two men could agree only to activate a handful of
committees to take up a host of thorny security and law enforcement
issues and, ostensibly at least, to try to speed the flow of the
economic and social benefits of peace to some increasingly restive
pockets of Palestinians. Developing. (Deans, Cox News Service).

Palestinian children's choir in singing a hymn in Manger Square
against the backdrop of a towering Christmas tree. The sightseeing
stop in the biblical town of 50,000 just south of Jerusalem
provided a brief, joyful interlude for Clinton at the close of his
often troubled three-day effort to revive the Wye River peace
agreement. Developing. (Kaplow, Cox News Service). ETA: 4 p.m.

   IMPEACH _ WASHINGTON _ President Clinton lost critical ground in
his effort to stave off impeachment today as nearly a dozen
moderate Republicans turned aside White House appeals and came out
in favor of removing the president. ``No one is above the law, not
even the president,'' said Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn. She

CLINTON SUPPORTERS SEARCH FOR WAY OUT OF IMPEACHMENT PUZZLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL and MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House, searching for a way out of the
impeachment quandary, endorsed a compromise offered Tuesday by 1996
Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole for a quick, tough
House-Senate censure of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   While other proposals floated Tuesday were designed to sidetrack
Clinton's threatened impeachment in the House, Dole's blueprint
offered the White House an escape from a Senate trial if he loses
when the House votes Thursday on whether to impeach _ or indict _
the president.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal by Dole, who served as Senate Republican leader for
11 years before seeking the presidency, called for Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., to introduce a joint congressional
resolution in the Senate that would incorporate the ``guts'' of the
articles of impeachment adopted by the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Dole said his proposal would require Clinton to publicly sign
the censure at a ceremony designed by GOP congressional leaders.
Clinton also would be required to forward copies of the signed
censure to his Cabinet, members of Congress and all heads of
government agencies within seven days.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, saying he wanted ``a tough but responsible'' outcome to
the impeachment struggle, said his proposal would permit speedy
disposition of the issue to enable Republicans to ``clear the decks
and move forward'' with the next Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot imagine a better way for Republicans to start the new
year than by taking charge and producing just results at this
historic moment,'' Dole said in a proposal outlined in an opinion
article in the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   While Dole's proposal offered an exit for Clinton after the
House impeachment vote on Thursday, two Clinton allies floated
additional trial balloons designed to sidetrack the threatened
impeachment by the House itself.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Michael Castle, R-Del., a moderate Republican with close
ties to Clinton dating back to their days as governors of Delaware
and Arkansas respectively, urged that Congress adopt a censure
resolution requiring Clinton to ``personally'' pay $2 million in
restitution over five years.
</P>
<P>
   Castle said the restitution requirement would reimburse American
taxpayers for roughly half of the $4 million expense of special
prosecutor Kenneth Starr's eighth-month inquiry into the
president's cover-up of his affair with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not too late to seek agreement on a strong resolution of
censure with a tangible form of restitution by the president,''
Castle said.
</P>
<P>
   The third trial balloon came from former White House lawyer
Lanny Davis, who suggested that Clinton appear before the House to
address lawmakers and answer some of their questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president can make his case in person before the full
House better than anyone,'' Davis told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' proposal echoed one offered in October by former
President Gerald Ford, a former House GOP leader, who suggested
that Clinton appear in the well of the House to receive a ``harshly
worded rebuke'' in lieu of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``No spinning, no semantics, no evasiveness or blaming others
for his plight,'' Ford wrote in an opinion article also published
in the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals came as Clinton suffered fresh setbacks in his bid
to stave off the first House impeachment since 1868. Several
moderate House Republicans announced decisions to vote for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton planned to pitch his case personally at a White House
meeting Wednesday with Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn. That meeting
also could include other undecided GOP moderates.
</P>
<P>
   Before heading home from Israel, Clinton was asked by a reporter
whether he was able to separate the impeachment challenge from his
efforts for Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' Clinton replied. ``You need to show up for work
every day. It's not a complicated thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The House will vote on four impeachment articles charging
perjury, obstruction of justice and abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is the second president in U.S. history since Andrew
Johnson to face a House vote on impeachment charges. President
Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 before the House voted on articles
of impeachment that had been adopted by the House Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton is impeached by the House, the Senate would convene a
trial. If convicted by a two-thirds vote, the president would
automatically be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., a Clinton ally who raised the
possibility of a censure vote in September, said that the outcome
of a Senate trial could be unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I know, hardly any of my colleagues in the Senate
have said how they would vote,'' said Lieberman, a former attorney
general in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Kennedy, the White House spokesman on the impeachment issue,
said the administration welcomes efforts to find a compromise short
of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't embraced any particular proposal but we generally
do welcome any opportunity to bring this to some bipartisan
closure,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said the proposal outlined by Dole was a ``serious
proposal that certainly deserves examination'' by the White House
and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do believe that a bipartisan solution short of impeachment
and removal from office is the best course for the country,''
Kennedy said.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has courted Dole ever since defeating him in the 1996
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton awarded the Kansas Republican the Presidential Medal of
Freedom at a White House ceremony on Jan. 17, 1997 _ three days
before the president's second inauguration. Clinton also invited
Dole to join the presidential entourage on a pre-Christmas visit to
Sarajevo in 1997 _ a joint appearance that helped symbolize
bipartisan support for U.S.-led efforts to prevent resumption of
fighting in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Dole helped quell conservative GOP criticism of
Clinton's controversial trip to China. Dole also has repeatedly
endorsed Clinton's efforts to expand free trade.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of Dole's proposal lies with Lott, however. Lott could
not be reached for comment on Dole's proposal on Tuesday.

 &HT;    SENATE TRIAL WOULD BE SOLEMN BUT UNPREDICTABLE
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If the House votes to impeach a president for the
second time in history, the scene will shift from the boisterous
partisanship of floor debate to a solemn yet unpredictable trial in
the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In the upper chamber, a code of rituals would transform the 100
senators into a jury, ordered to watch silently from their seats.
It would take two-thirds of them to convict and remove President
Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment that U.S. Chief Justice William Rehnquist
appeared to preside over the trial, the nation and world would
watch a spectacle not seen since President Andrew Johnson was
acquitted in a three-month Senate trial 130 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The process would start when representatives from the House
appear in the Senate chamber, bearing the articles of impeachment.
That would probably occur Jan. 6, the opening day of the new
Congress. The actual trial would begin some days or weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   As the trial opened, the president's lawyers would almost
certainly seek a prompt dismissal of the charges. One legal
argument advanced by the administration is that the impeachment
will have expired, since it was voted by a Congress that has
expired.
</P>
<P>
   However, few legal scholars support this argument, and the
Congressional Research Service has cited two cases of federal
judges who were impeached by the House in one Congress and
convicted by the Senate in the next.
</P>
<P>
   The senators would hold the trial six days a week, excluding
only Sundays, as the two sides made their case.
</P>
<P>
   A team of House members would manage the prosecution. They
probably would be led by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry
Hyde, the 74-year-old Illinois Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Ruff, the White House counsel, who tried to head off
impeachment in the Judiciary Committee, would be expected to lead
the defense.
</P>
<P>
   The president could appear in person, although that is not
required or anticipated. And Vice President Al Gore, normally the
presiding officer of the Senate with the power to cast tie-breaking
votes, would have no role in the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   As in any trial, both sides would give opening statements and
then call witnesses. That invites a public retelling on the Senate
floor of many of the seamy events that brought Clinton to
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Among those called could be former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky to testify on the sexual relationship with Clinton and his
alleged efforts to cover it up. Also on the potential witness list:
Lewinsky's former co-worker, Linda Tripp, and Clinton's secretary
Betty Currie.
</P>
<P>
   Through all of this, the senators would be required to sit in
unaccustomed silence, passing along any questions or motions in
writing to the chief justice.
</P>
<P>
   Rules of evidence and other procedures are not settled for this
quasi-judicial, quasi-political proceeding. Instead, the chief
justice would make rulings, which are subject to being overturned
by a majority vote of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Little is certain in such a trial, despite predictions by both
sides. Democrats have said it would tie up the business of the
nation for several months. Some Republicans have countered that it
would be over in three months or less.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows the answer to that,'' said Robert Dove, chief
Senate parliamentarian. ``I could posit a scenario that it's over
in days, or in months.''
</P>
<P>
   Dove, who conducted a study of impeachment procedures in
anticipation of a possible trial of President Richard Nixon in
1974, is predicting surprises if a trial occurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of a courtroom trial and how many things that can
happen,'' he said. A Senate impeachment trial is far less
structured, he cautioned, and ``unexpected things will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, a majority of the Senate could vote to end the
proceedings at any time. Or the senators could decide to pass a
censure motion instead of seeking Clinton's removal.
</P>
<P>
   If the trial reaches the closing arguments, the senators would
shut the doors and deliberate under rules that strictly limit how
much time each member could talk.
</P>
<P>
   It would take a two-thirds majority _ 67 senators if all vote _
to convict the president, a margin that pundits say would be next
to impossible to achieve in a Senate of 55 Republicans and 45
Democrats. However, if even one article of impeachment passes, the
president would be immediately removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate rules and the Constitution provide for no appeal.
</P>

PERJURY IS A PUNISHABLE CRIME, AND THAT'S NO LIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The first two impeachment articles that the House
will debate Thursday charge President Clinton with perjury in the
Monica Lewinsky sex scandal. But he has declared repeatedly that
while his sworn testimony regarding the former White House intern
was misleading, it was not perjury. Following is a primer on the
issue:
</P>
<P>
   WHAT IS PERJURY?
</P>
<P>
   Black's Law Dictionary defines perjury as ``a false statement
knowingly made'' in a court proceeding about ``some matter material
to the issue or point in question.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to perjury, federal law also prohibits making false
statements on federal forms or to federal officers such as FBI
agents. Unlike perjury, this crime may be committed without a sworn
oath. Under federal law, perjury and false statements are
punishable by an undetermined fine, up to five years in prison or
both.
</P>
<P>
   ARE PERJURY PROSECUTIONS COMMON?
</P>
<P>
   Out of 49,655 prosecutions in federal courts in 1997, 87 were
for perjury. In state courts such prosecutions are more common.
California, for instance, had 4,318 perjury cases among 326,768
felony prosecutions last year.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT DOES THE SUPREME COURT SAY ABOUT PERJURY?
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled in 1973 that while witnesses under oath must
tell the truth, they are not required to fill in the blanks. They
may answer questions narrowly as long as the answers are truthful.
In that case, Samuel Bronston, a movie producer whose company went
bankrupt, had been convicted of perjury for giving misleading,
though technically truthful, answers about his Swiss bank account.
The Supreme Court overturned his conviction.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT IS THE PERJURY CASE AGAINST PRESIDENT CLINTON?
</P>
<P>
   The specific allegations contained in Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr's Sept. 9 report to Congress refer to:
</P>
<P>
   _ Clinton's denial in his Jan. 17 deposition in the Paula Jones
sexual harassment lawsuit that he ever had a ``sexual affair,'' a
``sexual relationship'' or ``sexual relations'' with Lewinsky.
``Sexual relations'' were defined as ``when (a) person knowingly
engages in or causes ... contact with the genitalia, anus, groin,
breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of any person with an intent to
arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person ...''
</P>
<P>
   _ Clinton's insistence in his Aug. 17 grand jury testimony that
his Jan. 17 answer narrowly fit the definition of ``sexual
relations'' presented to him. During the Aug. 17 testimony, Clinton
acknowledged having ``inappropriate intimate contact'' with
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   _ Clinton's vague recollections in his Jan. 17 deposition on
whether he had ever been alone with Lewinsky and his statements
minimizing the number of gifts the two exchanged. Starr's report
cited 10 sexual encounters in the White House and the exchange of
about 50 gifts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Clinton's failure to be specific in his deposition when asked
about his conversations with Lewinsky around the time she was
called to be a witness in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit
against him. In the Starr report, Lewinsky testified that she and
Clinton discussed her involvement in the Jones case in detail at
least four times. In a 2 a.m. phone call from Clinton Dec. 17,
1997, he allegedly told her, ``You know, you can always say you
were coming to see Betty (Currie, Clinton's secretary) or that you
were bringing me letters.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Clinton's failure to recall whether his close friend,
Washington lawyer Vernon Jordan, had ever talked to Lewinsky about
her involvement in the Jones case. Jordan, who in late 1997 tried
to find Lewinsky a job in New York, told the grand jury he kept
Clinton fully informed of all his efforts on Lewinsky's behalf,
including finding her a lawyer after she was subpoenaed in the
Jones case on Dec. 19, 1997. On Jan. 7, Jordan told Clinton that
Lewinsky had signed an affidavit denying a sexual relationship with
the president.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT IS THE REPUBLICANS' ARGUMENT ON THE PERJURY CHARGES?
</P>
<P>
   They say Clinton perjured himself by playing word games with the
definition of ``sexual relations.'' The definition was broad enough
to include oral sex, and Clinton's denial that he touched or
stimulated Lewinsky was contradicted by Lewinsky. Second, his vague
recollections on being alone with Lewinsky, exchanging gifts and
other matters amounted to perjury because he knew when he testified
in the Jones deposition that he and Lewinsky had been alone
repeatedly, that they had exchanged numerous gifts and that he had
several conversations with her and Vernon Jordan over her's role in
the Jones case. House Judiciary Committee Republicans used
Clinton's more forthcoming Aug. 17 grand jury testimony to point up
discrepancies in the Jan. 17 deposition. For instance, Clinton said
in the deposition, ``I'm not sure'' when asked whether he talked to
Lewinsky about her testifying in the Jones case. But in his grand
jury testimony, he admitted he spoke to Lewinsky about it when she
visited him at the White House on Dec. 28, 1997. In his deposition,
Clinton said he had ``no specific recollection'' of being alone
with Lewinsky. But in his grand jury testimony, he acknowledged
being alone with Lewinsky on repeated occasions.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT IS CLINTON'S DEFENSE?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's defenders say he did not lie under oath but that even
if he did, untruths uttered to hide an extramarital sexual affair
do not rise to the level of offenses so severe that impeachment is
warranted. Clinton has said he believed ``sexual relations''
referred to sexual intercourse, and not oral sex. His lawyers cite
five dictionary definitions to back him up. ``This interpretation
may be confusing to some,'' Clinton's lawyers said in a 184-page
legal defense submitted to the Judiciary Committee. ``It may be
counterintuitive. It may lead to bizarre answers. But it certainly
was not objectively wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House also contends that Starr and House Republicans
have mischaracterized Clinton's testimony on subjects such as his
being alone with Lewinsky. Clinton answered ``yes'' when asked
whether it was possible he was alone with Lewinsky. On gift giving,
Clinton invited the Jones lawyers to list specific gifts so he
could confirm or deny any exchanges. After the lawyers named a few,
Clinton recalled giving Lewinsky something from the Black Dog, a
restaurant on Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts. On the question
of whether he discussed Lewinsky's possible testimony in the Jones
case with Lewinsky or Vernon Jordan, White House lawyers argue that
Starr and Republicans have pinpointed only the answers that suggest
perjury by Clinton. For instance, the Starr report says Clinton
answered, ``I don't think so'' when asked whether anyone besides
his lawyers told him that Lewinsky had been subpoenaed in the Jones
case. The report, White House lawyers argue, leaves out Clinton's
next answer that Deputy White House Counsel Bruce Lindsey first
told him.
</P>
<P>
   White House counsel Charles Ruff acknowledged to Judidicary
members that in the Jones deposition, Clinton ``walked up to the
line'' of perjury, and ``reasonable people ... could determine that
he crossed that line.'' But Ruff added that the president was
convinced he was telling the truth.
</P>
<P>
   CAN CLINTON EVER BE PROSECUTED FOR PERJURY?
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution says that impeachment and removal from office
are no bar to criminal prosecution afterward. However, a White
House-selected panel of former prosecutors and legal scholars told
the Judiciary Committee last week that the case for perjury against
Clinton was too weak to bring before a jury.

   IMPEACH (Washington) _ Lede-all on impeachment developments:
leadership meetings, vote decisions by various members, etc. By
Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-SENATE (Washington) _ Republican and Democratic senators
said Tuesday that it appeared increasingly unlikely that President
Clinton could avoid a trial in the Senate if the House votes this
week to impeach him. By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-CLINTON (Erez Crossing) _ President Clinton's trip ends
as his meeting with Arafat and Netanyahu fails to persuade Israel
to agree on a withdrawal that is due Friday under the Wye plan. By
Deborah Sontag. With photo and map.
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-CLINTON-MOOD (Jerusalem) _ Clinton was a puzzle during
this trip, even to some of his aides. He was clearly concerned
about the impeachment vote, occasionally checking on his position
in calls to chief-of-staff, John Podesta, or one of his
congressional experts, Steve Ricchetti. But when forced by
reporters to address the matter, he seemed almost indifferent, and
gave sullen answers that risked tipping away the fence-sitters
whose support he needs. By James Bennet.
</P>
<P>
   BKN-NBA-RACE (New York) _ The negotiations have often been
heated, with both sides pointing fingers and hurling profanity.
Egos have been bruised, and enormous amounts of money and pride
have been sacrificed. But while it sounds like any other labor war
in America, one dynamic separates the National Basketball
Association from other disputes _ the issue of race. The players
union is 85 percent black and has begun to question whether it is
being treated with respect by an ownership that is 100 percent
white. Any number of players have already concluded they are not
being taken seriously and seem angry enough to sacrifice a season
to prove a point. By Selena Roberts and Mike Wise.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS-AFRICA-MOURNING (Bulawayo, Zimbabwe) _ Across Africa, as
the AIDS epidemic has gnawed through people like a conqueror worm,
the number of the dying is so great that it is changing the culture
of death itself. There are 5,500 AIDS-related funerals every day in
Africa, according to the United Nations. On a continent where death
has always been a communal rather than a private matter, poverty
and emotional exhaustion are taking their toll. The poorest go
unshrouded into a common pit. Thousands of graves are left with no
markers grander than the favorite cup and spoon of the deceased,
smashed in loving memory of them. And people in all walks of life
shamefacedly confess that they no longer have the money or energy
to mourn as they feel African tradition demands. By Donald G.
McNeil Jr.
</P>
<P>
   CITIGROUP-CUTBACK (New York) _ Citigroup Inc., the newly formed
financial services giant attempting to integrate its businesses,
announced cost-cutting steps Tuesday that will eliminate 10,400
jobs or 6 percent of the company's work force. The job cuts go
beyond the roughly 8,000 the company had projected a few months ago
when it was formed by the merger of Citicorp and Travelers Group.

   FBN-PATRIOTS-STADIUM (Hartford, Conn.) _ Summary from wires:
five years of work to entice the New England Patriots to Hartford
culminated Tuesday in a special session of the Legislature on a
$374 million stadium deal for the National Football League team.
Gov. John Rowland and legislative leaders from both parties said
they were optimistic the stadium plan would pass. But as the debate
dragged, many lawmakers said they remained undecided. By Mike
Allen.

TARKINGTON WORTH READING, DESPITE BEING `OLD NEWS'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why do I keep coming back to Booth Tarkington? I suppose it's
because he never quite goes away. His once-lofty reputation has
long since diminished, but he still gets read, because reading him
is often pleasurable and never is sinful.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of sin in Tarkington is the key to both his low
profile with the critics and his eternal endorsement by the
constituency that made him popular. He was too nice. He played it
safe to retain the adoration of morally upright Middle America, of
which he was representative.
</P>
<P>
   The Indiana-born Newton Booth Tarkington (1869-1946) was as
prolific as he was respectable, marking a half-century publishing
career; but today he is known primarily for two novels, both being
early Pulitzer winners _ ``The Magnificent Ambersons'' (1918) and
``Alice Adams'' (1921).
</P>
<P>
   Those may be his most famous entries simply because they're in
the Pulitzer roll call, but my reading acquaintance with Tarkington
is sufficient to know they really are his best books. He was, of
course, ideally constituted for the Pulitzer fiction plum, which,
as stipulated in Joseph Pulitzer's will, must present a favorable
impression of American life _ the condition that kept Hemingway,
Faulkner and other worthies from gaining the prize until late in
their careers.
</P>
<P>
   One may read ``Alice Adams'' and ask if that portrait of
insular, hypocritical small-town life is favorable in any way. It
is downright damning. But Alice herself, a duplicitous
social-climber and a snob within her own drab family group, never
gets in bed with the boys; and if she did, Mr. Tarkington would not
detail the activity.
</P>
<P>
   That he is doggedly decent is both a virtue and a liability; but
by any account, ``Alice Adams'' is far superior to Sinclair Lewis'
similarly constituted ``Main Street,'' which preceded it by one
publishing season. Lewis wrote with a sledgehammer, and Tarkington
was rather more delicate. ``Main Street'' delivers its message
savagely, satirically, causing Henry Louis Mencken to salute Lewis
as ``the American Voltaire.'' ``Alice Adams'' is more conventional,
a novel in the realistic Howells tradition, but it is higher art.
One may take up ``Alice Adams,'' turn to any page to read a
paragraph or two, and be charmed. Try reading ``Main Street'' a
second time. You can't.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Magnificent Ambersons,'' possibly more famous today as
Orson Welles' first movie encore after ``Citizen Kane,'' is the
second installment of a now-forgotten trilogy of Midwestern city
life with the collective title of ``Growth.'' Preceded by ``The
Turmoil'' (1915) and followed by ``The Midlander'' (1923),
``Ambersons'' is such a novel as Henry James might have written,
were he an upper-middle-class product of the American Midwest
rather than a scion of aristocratic New England and life abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ambersons'' retains interest both as a picture of business
life and as a fugue of love stories rendered so realistically as to
transcend soap opera. Tarkington at his best was good, all right;
and again like Lewis, he would have a better name today if he had
written less.
</P>
<P>
   An elderly Booth Tarkington in wartime produced two quite good
novels _ ``Kate Fennigate'' and ``The Image of Josephine'' _ that
caused very little stir because its author was old news, critically
downgraded in his own lifetime. He was something of a feminist,
keen in his distaff portraiture, but these novels like ``Alice''
and ``Ambersons'' are penalized by the plethora of mediocrity in
the full Tarkington shelf. He wrote too much.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the early ``Monsieur Beaucaire'' (1900) endures as an
entertainment, and the Penrod stories would still have a place if
boys still read fiction. ``Seventeen,'' about ``Silly Billy''
Baxter, is still wonderful; Tarkington's contemporary tales have
value today as period pieces, and I don't believe he'll ever be
completely lost.

PARTY ANIMAL INSTINCTS FADE FAST WHEN REAL MATURITY ARRIVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA ANDERSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last Saturday evening, my husband returned home at 6 and caught
me taking a nap. I don't usually take naps, so he asked me, ``Are
you sick?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' I replied. ``I have to rest because we're going to
dinner and a movie with some friends in a little while. If I don't
take a nap, I'll fall asleep in my soup like I did last time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, I remember. You almost drowned before the waiter
rescued you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you really should have noticed long before I turned
blue. Apparently my head was in the bowl for several minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought you were looking for bugs. You know how you always
inspect your food before you eat it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was gurgling, for goodness sakes!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that what you were doing? I thought you were blowing on
that hot soup to cool it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, before time was of the essence, I considered myself
something of an ``animus partivus.'' That's an obscure Latin phrase
for ``party animal.'' During the week, I was a dutiful student, but
on the weekends I unleashed the beast.
</P>
<P>
   I boogied until the lights came on and polished off the evening
with a stack of pancakes floating in syrup. No party was
off-limits. No dance floor too crowded. I slept until noon on
Saturdays and then got ready to outdo my Friday night escapades. On
Sundays, I recuperated and transformed myself back into a geek.
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward past graduation, 100 headaches, and a never-ending
to-do list. I am now an official member of the prestigious
I.T.O.D.Y.K.W.M.P.I. Society. That's an acronym for ``It's 10
o'clock. Do you know where my pillow is?''
</P>
<P>
   I can stay alert from dawn until the evening news and then, as
if on cue, I start yawning. I feel like a kid in grade school
sometimes with my lack of stamina after dark. On countless
occasions, we've been enjoying a fun evening with friends for what
seems like hours and hours when I make the comment, ``Gee guys,
it's getting late. I'm exhausted. I'm ready to call it a night.''
</P>
<P>
   As I put the remainder of my celery sticks and grape skins
entree in a doggie bag, everyone glances at their timepieces _ it's
only 10:30.
</P>
<P>
   They laugh at me and tease, ``You party pooper. I bet you don't
even know who David Letterman is, do you? Are you afraid that your
carriage will turn back into a pumpkin?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' I reply, pointing at my friend Nicole, ``I'm afraid
she's going to drown in that bowl of tortilla soup.''
</P>
<P>
   Party poopers of the world; we are not alone.
</P>
<P>
   Sleep is good.

DIMAIO NURSING SORE ANKLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He is the type of guy anyone would want in their
foxhole. He's the kind of player who would crawl through broken
glass for a teammate, a friend, or to avoid missing a game.
</P>
<P>
   But as supportive as Rob DiMaio is to his Bruins teammates,
friends, and acquaintances, there was no alleviating the pain he
was feeling after Saturday's 4-1 loss to the Sabres. DiMaio's
giveaway early in the first period set up Buffalo's first goal, and
it was all downhill from there.
</P>
<P>
   The feisty winger refused to offer any disclaimers as to why he
had such a difficult evening. But further delving reveals that
DiMaio is struggling with the same affliction linemate Tim Taylor
is _ a balky ankle.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaio's injury occurred Nov. 3 in Buffalo. He hasn't felt like
himself since. Unlike last season, when the Bruins' top checking
line was among their brightest surprises, this year two-thirds of
that combination has been greatly hindered by bad ankles. Earlier
in the year, the third member of the line, P.J. Axelsson, suffered
two concussions and is just now beginning to find his game.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaio doesn't have a goal, he made a key mistake that led to an
opposing goal, and he was as depressed as anyone could be after the
game. Two days removed from the game and after a talk with coach
Pat Burns on the ice Tuesday during practice before flying to
Detroit for Wednesday's game, DiMaio was trying not to bury himself
in unnecessary pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Robbie is putting pressure on himself pointwise,''
said Burns. ``I don't care if he doesn't get a point all year. He
has to play his kind of game. He'll find his game again.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaio said his ankle problem is ``tolerable'' and his objective
is to relax a little bit more and not allow the weight of the world
to climb on his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``You struggle a little bit, you start thinking way too much,
and you make a mountain out of nothing,'' said DiMaio. ``We've been
playing pretty well and winning, and that's the bottom line. Such a
big part of the game is the mental part. You have to look at
yourself and believe in yourself and know how you can play. (When
you're struggling) you blow little things out of proportion. A
mistake is made that you pretty much make every time on the ice,
you turn that into something worse than it actually is. Through my
career, I've always been strong mentally. For some reason, right
now I'm searching for it a little bit, but I'm a professional and
I'll get out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he downplays his ankle injury, DiMaio has been hampered
by lack of strength. It prevents him from battling as hard in the
corners and along the boards, two of his signature assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not quite strong in situations where I'm normally at my
best _ in the corners and balancewise,'' he said. ``I seem to lose
edges more than I ever have. That's our game as a line. I'm not 100
percent doing that. I've got to find a different way to get there.
That's my game. It's been bad since the last time we played in
Buffalo. Every game, it seems like something twists. I know
injuries are part of the game. I've had a lot in my career and I
played through them and I'll play through this.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaio believes he's bothered by the psychological more than the
physical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel strong with my ankle, but it's not an excuse,''
he said. ``I have to deal with that. I think it's more confidence.
It's more in my head. I'm searching for something. I've got to find
it. I'm not contributing the way I have in the past. It's been
frustrating because I've had a bad ankle. I haven't been able to
get going the way I'd like to go. My line has been banged up. Once
we seem to get going, something else happens. It's a team game, and
I'm not a guy who's ever made an excuse for the way I played. I'm
responsible for what I do, and I have to find it. There's no easy
way to do that, but I'll definitely do my best to find it. I've
always found a way to fight through tough times and adversity.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Burns said Taylor went to the doctor Tuesday and likely will
have another magnetic resonance imaging to gauge the condition of
his ankle. ``Putting him in for one game and losing him for two,
putting him in for two and losing him for four, it was frustrating
him,'' said Burns. ``He wants to play, I understand that, but it's
going to have to take the time it's going to take. We can't keep on
going like this.'' . . . Burns said forward Peter Ferraro,
sidelined by a chest injury, won't be back until after Christmas,
though he accompanied the club to Detroit.

REP. BOEHLERT, UNDECIDED ON IMPEACHMENT, IS BURIED IN LOBBYING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, a moderate Republican from
upstate New York, was the target of furious lobbying Tuesday as he
prepared to announce his view on whether President Clinton should
be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   Boehlert is one of a dwindling group of undecided moderate
Republicans whose votes on Thursday will determine whether the
House impeaches Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   David Goldston, the congressman's legislative director, said he
expects Boehlert to announce his decision Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   To influence that decision, telephone callers from his district
and around the nation have inundated Boehlert's office. Since
Thursday, 1,400 callers have favored impeachment, 1,210 callers
oppose it and 79 callers urge censure for the president, according
to Renee Longacre, spokeswoman for Boehlert.
</P>
<P>
   Goldston said the calls are continuing to come in ``fast and
furious.'' Those callers from the district are evenly split on
whether the House should impeach Clinton. Calls coming from
elsewhere in country have lately been leaning against impeaching
Clinton, Goldston said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who are (against impeachment) are concerned that
Congress is rushing headlong into this and it is simply a (sexual)
affair,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Goldston said the calls do not appear to be orchestrated by
political groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting calls from a lot of people who have never called
a congressional office before,'' Goldston said.
</P>
<P>
   For every caller from Boehlert's New York district, six dial in
from other states.
</P>
<P>
   Boehlert aide Donnie DeMarco said the calls have included
tearful pleas from elderly ladies fearing ``the country will go
downhill'' if Clinton is impeached as well as appeals from
stockbrokers worried about the effect of impeachment on financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
   The pleas are also coming from cyberspace. Over the weekend,
Boehlert's office received 8,000 e-mails on the impeachment issue,
compared to 90 e-mails on a normal weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Boehlert said he has been looking for more contrition
from the president for his behavior in the White House sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important in my mind to look at it and evaluate it and
make a judgment on what he is really saying,'' Boehlert said. ``Is
this a classic finesse, or does he really mean it? I don't know how
you judge that. I know how I judge it.''
</P>
<P>
   Boehlert, 62, who just won his ninth term, has so far declined a
Friday offer by White House officials to discuss impeachment and
another from actor Robert DeNiro as he struggles to make up his
mind, said Goldston.
</P>
<P>
   Boehlert has been consulting legal and political experts in his
district, which includes Utica, Rome and rural stretches in Oneida
County, and he has participated in conference calls among other
undecided moderate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Boehlert, a moderate Republican who is a former congressional
aide and public relations executive, voted with his party 75
percent of the time in 1995, the most he has voted with Republicans
since he came to the House in 1993.

 &HT;    AOL sets sights south of the border
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Already established as the main way to reach the
Internet in North America, and with service in Europe, Australia
and China, America Online has now announced plans to bring the
online service to the fast-growing Latin American market.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's largest online service formed a joint venture to
create online services for South America with Cisneros Group, one
of South America's largest media companies.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros will invest $100 million for a 50 percent stake, while
AOL will provide its technology and brand for the remaining 50
percent stake. The venture will first target Brazil, Argentina and
Mexico, the companies said in a conference call with reporters
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's strategy for the overseas market has been to partner with
local media companies such as Germany's Betelsman AG to develop
local channels and services for its international versions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latin America is poised to become the next great growth center
for the interactive medium,'' said Cisneros Group Chairman Gustavo
Cisneros. ``The market for this product is unlimited.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros predicted that within several years, Latin America
Online will post membership numbers as large the original AOL.
</P>
<P>
   The service will roll out next year in Mexico, Brazil and
Argentina. Cisneros said the Latin American market is fast
approaching 2.5 million computer users, with a projection of 5
million by 2000. Currently there are 1.3 million users in Brazil,
221,000 in Argentina and 328,000 in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   But for AOL or any Internet provider, the market in Latin
America is heavy on potential and light on short-run prospects.
</P>
<P>
   At least until the appearance of a cheap wireless solution,
phone lines are the key to Internet access _ and phone lines are at
a premium through most of Latin America. Not only are phone lines
scarce in under-developed nations, but the prevailing systems have
been run by state monopolies for decades and are often unreliable.
For example, Brazil represents a huge chunk of the region's
commerce with a population of about 165 million and a gross
domestic product approaching $1 trillion. Yet there are fewer than
10 phones for every 100 people in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Phones in Argentina, perhaps the wealthiest Latin nation, are
about twice as common per person as in Brazil _ and that still
falls far below the figure for the more-developed nations. For
instance, there are more than 60 phones per 100 people in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   But Brazil and other Latin countries have been privatizing their
phone networks, permitting billions of dollars in investment by
foreign companies. That cash injection is expected to mean more
phones _ and better technology.
</P>
<P>
   However, the process of expanding phone systems _ or improving
them _ is likely to take years.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth is among the larger investors in the Latin American
telephone market, but has concentrated thus far on wireless phone
service.

 &HT;    `Important thing is word of mouth'
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As Mark Feidler completes his first year as president
of BellSouth Mobility, that wireless unit is an increasingly
critical part of BellSouth Corp.'s rosy financial picture.
BellSouth Mobility has sales of about $3 billion a year, yet faces
added competition from upstart companies, as well as national
powerhouses like AT&AMP;T. Feidler recently sat for a lengthy interview
with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Excerpts of their talk are
below:
</P>
<P>
   Q: Safety is a big reason a lot of people have wireless phones.
But there are holes in everybody's coverage, places where the
phones will not work....
</P>
<P>
   A: ``At a fundamental level, I think that any customers are
safer when they have access to telecommunications. The issue
becomes, did they (the sales staff) oversell the ability to make a
call? I think we have a fair balance on that issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you think of the idea of requiring phone companies to
cover the entire coverage area?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``We've made a decision as a nation and an industry that that
is not the model that we like anymore. Wireless has never had the
model of government deciding what people want, what people pay _
that is the land-line telephone model.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And you know, the cell phone, as good as it is, is not going
to protect society from all the actions of some vicious people.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you need to succeed in the market?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``You've got to be in the ballpark on pricing, but after
that, the most important thing is word of mouth. It's interesting
that we, the wireless industry, seem to ... be a topic people talk
about. And that's good for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: One way or another, Atlanta is a pretty hot market for
wireless. What percent of people here have wireless phones?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``I've seen different estimates, mostly in the mid-30s. We
are actually pretty hip here (in Atlanta). We buy a lot of
wide-screen televisions and DVD players _ cutting-edge things. And
we also have some world-class commutes here. I don't want people to
have long commutes, but if you are in a car, using the phone is one
of the few things you can do and feel at all productive.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've said wireless can complement a land-line phone, that
you've got ways of taking advantage of each...
</P>
<P>
   A: ``For example, we put both on a single bill. We have
'complete choice cellular' where you pay a single fee and get both.
For the future, we are trying out something called ``Call Wizard''
in Jacksonville. You give people your mobile phone number and your
mobile phone rings. When you come home or to your office _ if
you're a small-business owner _ you put the phone back in the
charger. That action tells the network to forward all calls to your
landline phone. You do that and you don't pay any air time
charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've still got some wireless investments outside the
region, in Houston, Los Angeles, Indianapolis... What does that
mean for your core strategy?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``We bought most of our out-of-region properties in the 1989
to '92 time frame. Wireless was less well-understood back then, and
we were able to buy some attractive properties at good prices. But
we can't win as a company without winning in the Southeast. We
won't be the only player, but we've got to be a successful player.
We have other options in Indy.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does the future look like?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``AT&AMP;T did a study 15 years ago ... they predicted 1 million
wireless customers by 2000. (There are now about 65 million users.)
We are fortunate that 14 or 25 years later, we still have an
industry growing at 15 to 20 percent a year. Nobody knows exactly
what's going to happen in the next five or 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: There are six wireless companies in Atlanta now and Sprint is
going to launch soon. Does that affect the way you do your
business?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``We are to the point where whether it's six or seven _ it's
hard to tell. It's like running in the Peachtree Road Race. Whether
you are running against 50,000 or 49,000 people, it just doesn't
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: How about Nextel, which is selling not just the phone
function but the two-way radio idea of instant connection?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``We don't have that functionality. We looked at adding it
and decided against it. We think we have a higher quality circuit
switch, that gives us more reliability, better clarity. ... But in
a market with five competitors, you can't be all things to
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Nextel and AT&AMP;T talk about national roaming. Is that hard to
compete with, when you are mostly a Southeast offering?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``First, they can offer national roaming only where they are.
That is, some cities and maybe just some downtown areas. If that's
all you need, you fly to some airport and then go downtown, fine.
But the fact of the matter is that most roaming dollars are people
just getting 80 or 100 miles away. You think that a phone is
valuable because now you can call Indonesia, but you call your
neighbor more times than anybody else. I mean, you could open up
the window and shout.''

 &HT;    Hit a button and presto! Your car rises
 &HT;    By Gene Tharpe
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A woman struggling to change a flat tire on her car
alongside the expressway sparked an idea for Ricky Vann. ``Gee
whiz,'' he thought, ``wouldn't it be nice if she could just push a
button to lift the car?''
</P>
<P>
   The thought _ and Vann's subsequent efforts to make it reality _
recently led to Vann being issued U.S. patent No. 5813661.
</P>
<P>
   The patent protects an ``electromagnetic jack system'' for
lifting portions or all of a vehicle. ``It could be installed on
new vehicles when they are built and added to older vehicles,''
said Vann, a Loganville, Ga. resident.
</P>
<P>
   The system consists of four electromagnetically operated jacks
attached to the bottom of the vehicle at each corner, and a
dashboard-mounted console to control current flow to the
electromagnets. The jacks can be used individually to lift one
tire, or all together to lift the entire vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Vann said each jack consists of two electromagnets placed within
a shaft with a flat base that lowers to the ground when needed.
When activated from the control panel, the two electromagnets are
charged with like polarity, which _ as science students will know _
causes a repelling effect that pushes the two electromagnets apart.
This provides the lift to jack up the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   When the tire is replaced, the control panel changes the current
flow to cause unlike polarity between the two electromagnets.
Unlike polarity attracts, which permits the two electromagnets to
come together, retracting the jack and lowering the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a push-button world in many ways,'' said Vann. ``Why
not this?''

 &HT;    Thanks to venture capital, tech companies find backing By Mark
Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Like the stock market, the amount of money invested in
high-tech companies by way of venture funds is on the rise,
nationally and here in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The metro area which has experienced dramatic growth in the
number of high tech companies calling it home, is attracting an
increasing amount money from investors looking companies poised for
growth and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Gray, a local venture capital investor, has seen
positive changes in the Atlanta investment community.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more money, a lot more money,'' Gray said. ``There's a
lot more money generally, I think, in the country. There's a
snowball effect. I'm not sure what comes first, the entrepreneur or
the capital, but they grow together. And the knowledge and
expertise has grown dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   Venture capital is the financial water that helps companies
grow. The money typically is invested when the companies are young,
but before they go public or are sold, sometime between promise and
profit.
</P>
<P>
   Companies usually take venture capital from several sources.
Synchrologic, a recent graduate of the Georgia Tech's Advanced
Technology Development Center incubator, took $6.5 million in
September from a Maryland venture fund, the Boston University
Community Technology Fund and four local sources: Alliance
Technology Ventures, Noro-Moseley Partners, John Imlay and Gray
Ventures.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year-old company makes software that helps integrate
customers and employees who are connecting to a company's computer
system from off-site. Synchrologic is using the money for research
and development and to expand its sales and distribution
departments.
</P>
<P>
   In the three months that ended Sept. 30, $3.7 billion in venture
capital was invested nationally, according to the
PriceWaterhouseCoopers Money Tree survey. The Southeast got $336
million of that. Georgia companies received $87 million, third in
the region, just behind Florida's $88 million and North Carolina,
which had $112 million in investments. Of Georgia's $87 million,
$79 million was invested in technology, health care or
communications companies, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
   As Georgia's reputation as a hot investment market has grown, so
has the number of local venture funds and outside funds investing
locally. Boston's Battery Ventures invested recently in Witness
Systems, a company that makes software that helps run call centers.
Oak Investment Partners, which has offices in Connecticut and
Silicon Valley, has money in BT Squared Technologies, an Atlanta
company that makes software for sales staffs.
</P>
<P>
   Cordova Ventures, the venture fund formerly known as Cordova
Capital, is part of a investment community blooming in Atlanta
suburban corridor. Live Oak Equity Partners, one of Atlanta's
newest funds, has an office one floor below. Alliance Technology
Ventures is building new offices nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Dalton heads Cordova's information technology practice.
The fund consists of $145 million invested in about 45 companies,
half of which are local. Overall, Cordova is invested in 60 small-
to medium-sized companies in information technology, health care,
telecommunications and financial services.
</P>
<P>
   Three of Cordova's four funds are devoted to information
technology companies. Cordova is raising money for two more funds,
one should be finished this month, the other by mid-1999.
</P>
<P>
   Cordova invests in a wide range of companies, from start-ups to
later-stage private companies. The deal sizes average between
$250,000 and $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Dalton said he receives many of the business plans he looks at
by E-mail. Unsolicited plans rarely turn into deals, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cordova recently put $3 million into CareLinc, an Atlanta health
care information technology company.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to companies, there are inviduals known in the
industry as angels who invest in high tech upstarts. Bernard Gray
took some of the money from the $340 million sale of Summit
Communications Group to Time Warner in 1994, and launched a vehicle
for angel investing.
</P>
<P>
   Gray Ventures has invested in 18 companies, 12 of which he still
has a stake in. Half of those are in the Atlanta area, the rest are
in Research Triangle Park, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Gray tends to invest in information technology companies. Angel
investors typically invest their money in companies early, but
before traditional venture capital is invested.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, Gray has put money into Monorail, a Marietta firm that
introduced the sub-$1,000 PC in 1997, as well as Alpharetta's
Synchrologic and Advanced Charger Technology, a battery company in
Norcross.
</P>
<P>
   Gray receives many of the business plans by E-mail. Some are
handed to him by people he meets at entrepreneurial forums. But
most investment opportuniteis come through networking.
</P>
<P>
   Gray invests in less than 1 percent of the companies he studies.
Chemistry swings a lot of the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does he have the experience to be doing it, the proper vision?
Is the compass set properly in place?,'' he said. ``Technology
investors can get enamored with the technology, but you really
invest in the people and the combination of the technology and the
people. I dwell on what you can do with the technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Live Oak Equity Partners is one of Atlanta's newest venture
groups. The $70 million fund started in July. It is run by Jim
Gilbert, Murali Anatharaman and Chad McCall, son of Charles McCall,
Chairman and CEO of HBO &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Live Oak's health care information technology focus reflects
Gilbert's background. He worked for HBO &AMP; Co. and Imnet, before the
latter company was bought by HBO this summer. HBO sells software to
automate some of the functions in doctor's offices and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Live Oak has made one investment, $3 million in a West coast
health care software company. A $3 million second-round investment
with an unnamed local company is in the works.
</P>
<P>
   Live Oak Equity raised its money from several sources, including
Wachovia, the Georgia Tech Foundation, Charles McCall and Lewis
Jordan, a ValuJet co-founder.
</P>
<P>
   At HBO, Gilbert evaluated companies for potential acquisition.
Now he evaluates them for investment. Gilbert and the fund managers
are looking at companies taking early-round investment. The group
invests between $2 million and $5 million per deal.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert said they have looked at 160 companies so far. They base
their decisions on the potential size of the marketplace, the stage
of the company and the diversity of the management team.
</P>
<P>
   Noro-Moseley Partners is one of Atlanta's oldest venture capital
firms. The first fund started in the early 1980s. Noro-Moseley is
on its fourth fund. As of Oct. 31, $22 million of the $112 million
fund has been invested.
</P>
<P>
   What started as a diverse fund in the 1980s has turned into one
focused heavily on technology and healthcare. Geographically,
Noro-Moseley tends to look at companies in Atlanta, Raleigh/Durham
and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Taetle left Internet access company MindSpring Enterprises
to join Noro-Moseley in May. He said it takes between one month and
three months to decide whether to invest in a company. Most of that
time is homework.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big difference (between investing your money and
someone else's),'' Taetle said. ``I feel like the weight of the
world sometimes. You're dealing with larger dollars, so you tend to
be more thorough with your due diligence.
</P>
<P>
   Taetle said connections are the key to getting a business
proposal read carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something comes in and it's highly recommended by some law
firm we know or someone we've invested with, it doesn't matter if
it's written on parchment and crayon,'' he said. ``We'll still take
a look.''
</P>
<P>
   Noro-Moseley recently invested in Talus, a revenue management
software company with an Atlanta office, and OpenSite, an online
auction site.

 &HT;    Radio station goes interactiveBy Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta alternative radio station WNNX-FM, better
known as 99X, had 3,000 free Christmas CD's from its ``Deck the
Hall Ball'' to give away. Beginning Dec. 14 at midnight, users
could log to music retailer TotalE.com and request the disc. By
mid-afternoon, the CD's were gone, proving that in Atlanta, at
least, if you promote it, people will surf.
</P>
<P>
   The station's on-air personalities talked up the offer all
weekend as well as at the concert and by late Monday afternoon all
the CD's had been snapped up by 99X listeners. The ``Deck the Hall
Ball'' CD features the Squirrel Nut Zippers, Beck, Shawn Mullins,
Tori Amos and a host of others singing traditional Christmas songs
to benefit the Atlanta Community Food Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Mellas, TotalE's marketing director says the decision to
partner with 99X, was its first radio partnership. Mellas said the
station liked the idea of the event because ``we were tied in with
a part of community effort and charity event and (it) made us feel
like more of part of a community.''
</P>
<P>
   She also says building an intimate connection with radio
listeners and music lovers seemed obvious. ``We could go to Yahoo,
where you are paying for all these eyeballs, but they aren't
necessarily your customers. We decided to appeal directly to
customers who might really want to buy our products.'' Mellas said
that targeting local radio stations and seeking out events such as
the ``Deck the Hall Ball'' are ideal for getting the TotalE brand
out in front of music lovers who do purchase CDs, videos and DVDs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've discovered that doing promos on the Internet has really
been an extension of our marketing,'' says 99x promotion director
Jennifer Nech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the reason we got into this arena is we found we had a
real expertise in targeting marketing direct to consumers (TotalE
is a division of music club Columbia House). We also know a lot
about where customers are seeking out their music purchases and
what drives them to make a purchase.'' In the very competitive
online music arena, Total E has decided to build brand recognition
in local communities, one market at a time. ``Partnership deals on
AOL and Yahoo are great for building a brand,'' Mallas says, ``but
we wanted to build a business.'' Put more simply, Total E wants to
attract shoppers, not just eyeballs. ``We're involved in this (CD
giveaway) because we are trying to build these people as customers,
even if right now they aren't making a hard dollar purchase,
they'll come to our site and get to know us,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Nech of 99x says 75 to 85 per cent of the station's listeners
have home computers and the station is using that to its advantage
to market and promote the station locally and world-wide
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting a response from listeners from Japan and all
over the world,''Nech says. ``We now have the ability to have the
worldwide audience and we don't want our contests to be restricted
to just Georgia residents, so promotions like this one with TotalE
work really well.''

 &HT;    Consultant begs: Take us to your leader
 &HT;    By Rob Chambers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Consultant Ted Fisher is looking for ``a big mule,''
and Georgia's Gov.-elect Roy Barnes said last week that he'd
consider helping in the search.
</P>
<P>
   Translation: With the encouragement of the Common Services
Committee of the Atlanta Year 2000 Users Group, Fisher, along with
public relations man George Goodwin, is scouting for a leader. This
person would help form a volunteer project to assist in the
coordination of Y2K activities of government, business and the
general population.
</P>
<P>
   While Barnes said he hadn't heard directly from the Users Group,
he said he might help.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something I'd be willing to talk about and consider''
and ``see if we couldn't get somebody distinguished to step
forward,'' Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look back on the history of Atlanta, when problems
have risen, there's usually been some major business figure who
took the lead and who was able to recruit others to help solve the
problem. This was usually done quietly and behind the scenes,''
Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to a ``power structure,'' the term coined by
Floyd Hunter, author of a classic 1953 study of Atlanta's prime
movers.
</P>
<P>
   But Fisher doesn't see any such leadership at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried to get help from the chamber of commerce, but it's
not on their radar screen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely a leadership gap,'' said Jim Jones,
managing director of the Information Management Forum Year 2000
Group. ``It's difficult to say where it should have come from.
Ordinarily, this kind of issue is one that the business community
should take the leadership position on. But with all the potential
litigation out there, it's easy to see why a business leader
wouldn't be out there on Front Street with Y2K.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To be quite honest, this is not an issue'' that has until
recently ``captured the hearts and minds of most senior business
leaders, with exceptions such as Equifax.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a technical issue at its root, and most CEOs don't feel
comfortable in that arena,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Government, Jones said, has ``come late to the party, to put it
mildly,'' and is so enmeshed in its own Y2K problems it can't offer
much in the way of leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher believes that, apart from problems that might emerge from
lack of a coordinated effort, the leadership position of Atlanta in
the Southeast is at stake.
</P>

   ``Atlanta,'' he said, has ``pulled significantly ahead of
Birmingham in the fight to become the hub of U.S. business in the
Southeast. Now we're locked in a duel with Charlotte to maintain
that leadership,'' and the issue ``might well be decided'' by which
city ``is most successful in dealing with the Year 2000 problem.''

 &HT;    GOVERNMENT SAYS MICROSOFT USED SALES 'HIT TEAM' ON COMPETITORS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARY BETH REGAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Government lawyers rolled more videotape of
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates' deposition Tuesday, trying to show
that the software giant attacked competitors with a ``hit team'' of
sales people as part of an effort to protect its market dominance.
</P>
<P>
   In a 45-minute slice of Gates' 20-hour pretrial deposition, the
government focused on a 1994 e-mail exchange. In one message, a
Microsoft employee proposed using the company's Windows operating
system monopoly to pressure a competitor, IBM Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail message, Gates asked his employees to look into
IBM's practice of helping Lotus Development Corp. with sales of
Notes, an e-mail program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why does IBM help Lotus so much?,'' Gates wrote. ``Is there
anything we can do about this? ...I want us to figure out how to
solve this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, Microsoft employee Joachim Kempin responded
that IBM was using its own people to sell Notes. ``I am willing to
do whatever it takes to kick them out, but strongly believe that we
need a WW hit team to attack IBM as a large account,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed by Justice Department lead attorney David Boies for an
explanation, Gates said the term ``WW hit team'' referred to global
sales people.
</P>
<P>
   Boies asked, ``Are salespeople within Microsoft commonly
referred to as WW hit teams?''
</P>
<P>
   Hunched in a leather chair, Gates shot back, ``If they're
worldwide and they're trying to sell to somebody who is a large
account, you bet.''
</P>
<P>
   The testimony was intended to underscore the Justice
Department's allegation that Microsoft is using its market
dominance in operating systems to pressure competitors and gain an
advantage in new markets such as Internet browsing.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft spokesman Mark Murray discounted the e-mail messages _
which Gates said he couldn't recall _ as old and insignificant.
``That was almost five years ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The government showed several more videotaped depositions
Tuesday, though, to make the same point.
</P>
<P>
   In one, a Walt Disney Co. executive testified that Microsoft
pressured his company to avoid working with Netscape Communications
Corp., which markets a competing Internet browser, in order to
secure a coveted spot on the Windows desktop.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Wadsworth, vice president of business development at
Disney's Buena Vista Internet Co., told prosecutors that Microsoft
insisted his company avoid any cross-promotional deals with
Netscape if they wanted to protect their real estate on Microsoft's
desktop.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the frustrated Wadsworth wrote in an e-mail
message, ``We are being roughed up by the 1,000-pound gorilla.''
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth said he felt as though Microsoft was pressuring Disney
because of its market position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like they knew that we'd be making a mistake to choose
something over them,'' he said. ``Basically I agreed with them. But
I felt like it was a difficult way to get there. I felt like we
were being, you know, leveraged.''
</P>
<P>
   Lead Microsoft attorney John Warden dismissed the day's video
clips as examples of the government's insistence on misconstruing
Microsoft's actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is another example of a how hard-nosed business
negotiations are being presented by the government as wrongdoing,''
Warden said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the government plans to show videotaped
depositions from John Kies, of Packard Bell NEC, and David Limp, of
Network Computer Inc. Boies said he wants introduce all the
depositions, which must be played in court, before the court
recesses Thursday for a holiday break lasting until early next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Boies said he may play more Gates videotape Wednesday if edited
excerpts can be prepared for court submission by 10 a.m. EST

 &HT;    GOVERNMENT SAYS MICROSOFT USED SALES 'HIT TEAM' ON COMPETITORS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARY BETH REGAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Government lawyers rolled more videotape of
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates' deposition Tuesday, trying to show
that the software giant attacked competitors with a ``hit team'' of
sales people as part of an effort to protect its market dominance.
</P>
<P>
   In a 45-minute slice of Gates' 20-hour pretrial deposition, the
government focused on a 1994 e-mail exchange. In one message, a
Microsoft employee proposed using the company's Windows operating
system monopoly to pressure a competitor, IBM Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail message, Gates asked his employees to look into
IBM's practice of helping Lotus Development Corp. with sales of
Notes, an e-mail program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why does IBM help Lotus so much?,'' Gates wrote. ``Is there
anything we can do about this? ...I want us to figure out how to
solve this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, Microsoft employee Joachim Kempin responded
that IBM was using its own people to sell Notes. ``I am willing to
do whatever it takes to kick them out, but strongly believe that we
need a WW hit team to attack IBM as a large account,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed by Justice Department lead attorney David Boies for an
explanation, Gates said the term ``WW hit team'' referred to global
sales people.
</P>
<P>
   Boies asked, ``Are salespeople within Microsoft commonly
referred to as WW hit teams?''
</P>
<P>
   Hunched in a leather chair, Gates shot back, ``If they're
worldwide and they're trying to sell to somebody who is a large
account, you bet.''
</P>
<P>
   The testimony was intended to underscore the Justice
Department's allegation that Microsoft is using its market
dominance in operating systems to pressure competitors and gain an
advantage in new markets such as Internet browsing.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft spokesman Mark Murray discounted the e-mail messages _
which Gates said he couldn't recall _ as old and insignificant.
``That was almost five years ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The government showed several more videotaped depositions
Tuesday, though, to make the same point.
</P>
<P>
   In one, a Walt Disney Co. executive testified that Microsoft
pressured his company to avoid working with Netscape Communications
Corp., which markets a competing Internet browser, in order to
secure a coveted spot on the Windows desktop.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Wadsworth, vice president of business development at
Disney's Buena Vista Internet Co., told prosecutors that Microsoft
insisted his company avoid any cross-promotional deals with
Netscape if they wanted to protect their real estate on Microsoft's
desktop.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the frustrated Wadsworth wrote in an e-mail
message, ``We are being roughed up by the 1,000-pound gorilla.''
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth said he felt as though Microsoft was pressuring Disney
because of its market position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like they knew that we'd be making a mistake to choose
something over them,'' he said. ``Basically I agreed with them. But
I felt like it was a difficult way to get there. I felt like we
were being, you know, leveraged.''
</P>
<P>
   Lead Microsoft attorney John Warden dismissed the day's video
clips as examples of the government's insistence on misconstruing
Microsoft's actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is another example of a how hard-nosed business
negotiations are being presented by the government as wrongdoing,''
Warden said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the government plans to show videotaped
depositions from John Kies, of Packard Bell NEC, and David Limp, of
Network Computer Inc. Boies said he wants introduce all the
depositions, which must be played in court, before the court
recesses Thursday for a holiday break lasting until early next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Boies said he may play more Gates videotape Wednesday if edited
excerpts can be prepared for court submission by 10 a.m. EST
Wednesday.

 &HT;    Assistants deserve credit, Eagles coach insists
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   STATESBORO, Ga. _ Paul Johnson, one victory from a national
championship, is the only Division I coach in the nation with a
14-0 team. But while many around Statesboro and the Southern
Conference in general are praising Georgia Southern's second-year
coach, he is quick to credit his assistants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, I had put together a staff before I took the
job,'' said Johnson, whose Eagles play Massachusetts (11-3) for the
1-AA championship Saturday in Chattanoooga. ``Most of the guys
either played for me, coached with me or I knew them well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing was to put together a group of guys who
could get along, individuals who would not let their egos get in
the way,'' he said. ``I've been around a lot of staffs, but this
one gets along better than any one I've seen, and it's done one
heck of job on and off the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a 41-year-old product of Southern Conference sister
Western Carolina (1979), was a member of Erk Russell's staff at
Georgia Southern when the Eagles won back-to-back national
championships in 1985-86.
</P>
<P>
   After eight years at Hawaii and two at the Naval Academy as
offensive coordinator, Johnson returned to Statesboro in November
1996 for his first job as head coach to replace Frank Ellwood who
went 4-7 as a one-year interim coach.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and his staff not only changed the attitude of the 1996
grouip but also have provided consistently sound game plans so that
Georgia Southern has won 24 of 27 games since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see how Paul has gone in there and turned that team around
from its worst season (in 1996) to a good season last year (at
10-3) and a great one this year has been remarkable,'' Furman coach
Bobby Johnson said. ``A lot of teams have done a lot of things to
try to stop their offense, but they have reacted well to everything
_ which shows how well prepared the team is. (Paul) got my vote for
Division I-AA coach of the Year.''
</P>
<P>
   That the Eagles' option offense is so flexible and potent is the
result of work and familiarity, not happenstance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the reason we've been so successful on that side of
the ball,'' Georgia Southern's Johnson said, ``is because the
offensive staff includes a lot of guys who played or coach with me
before I came back here.''
</P>
<P>
   Two members of Johnson's staff, offensive coordinator Mike Sewak
and defensive line coach and recruiting coordinator John Pate, were
assistants at Georgia Southern with Johnson during the title years
in the mid-'80s. Secondary coach Giff Smith was a member of the
Eagles' 1989-90 championship squads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys knew what what it was like when we won back then,''
Johnson said. ``We had (former quarterback) Tracy Ham on our staff,
but (Montreal of the CFL) offered him a load of money to return as
a player, and he took it.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback coach Michael Carter played for Johnson at Hawaii.
Slotback coach Jeff Monken was a graduate assistant one year
Johnson was there. Johnson knew the fathers of defensive
coordinator Rusty Russell, Erk's son, and wide receiver coach Brian
Bohannon, whose father, Lloyd, was a long-time coach at Griffin
High School.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive back coach Joey Houston worked with Johnsonat
Gardner-Webb, 1995-96. During the same period , defensive line
coach Bob Bodine and fullback coach Brent Davis from Georgia became
familiar with their future boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to be as successful as we've been,'' Johnson said,
``has required a lot of hard work from everybody. I'm proud of this
team and this coaching staff.''

 &HT;    '98 Falcons could be like '97 Bucs
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In at least one regard, the Atlanta Falcons see
themselves as this year's version of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and
when Pro Bowl rosters are announced today, they hope voters view
things the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay had a league-high seven players who were named to the
NFL's all-star game last season, a measure of respect afforded a
team that went 10-6 after years of futility.
</P>
<P>
   Several Falcons are having outstanding seasons. But the same
thing has happened in the past and the players didn't receive Pro
Bowl votes, in part because the team was weak and received little
media exposure.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the case this year. The Falcons' 12-2 record ties the
franchise mark for victories, and the players have been media
darlings.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Jamal Anderson, quarterback Chris Chandler,
cornerback Ray Buchanan, linebackers Jessie Tuggle and Cornelius
Bennett, wide receiver Terance Mathis and defensive ends Lester
Archambeau and Chuck Smith merit consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is second in the NFL with 1,596 rushing yards and
second in the NFC with 13 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we'll get the windfall that Tampa Bay got last
year,'' he said. ``I'm really prepared for the worst, because of
the things that have happened here in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuggle was the only Falcons player voted into the Pro Bowl last
year, although Chandler went as an alternate. Many people
considered it an injustice that Smith and defensive tackle Travis
Hall were not selected.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan leads the NFC with seven interceptions and has a
team-high 15 pass breakups, but he knows how the system works.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't control it,'' he said. ``I've been in a situation
where I had eight interceptions, three (returned) for touchdowns,
119 tackles and didn't even get mentioned because we (the 1994
Colts) were a losing team.''
</P>
<P>
   Falcons players voted Monday. They're not allowed to vote for
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to go out of our way to be just, because we've been
wronged _ a la Chuck Smith last year,'' Anderson said. ``I would be
sad and shocked if Ray Buchanan doesn't go, and Jessie and
Cornelius. Chuck and Lester _ at least one should go.
</P>
<P>
   ``And (Minnesota's) Randall Cunningham and (San Francisco's)
Steve Young are having great years, but Chris should be the third
quarterback. It would be a travesty if one of our linemen didn't
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Injured players can be voted to the team as an honor and then
replaced by alternates. Anderson said Falcons fullback Bob
Christian, whose season end last Sunday when he tore knee
ligaments, should get the nod.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seriously, who has played the fullback position better?''
Anderson asked. ``People are going to say (Tampa Bay's) Mike
Alstott has rushing numbers and mention (Arizona's) Larry Centers
because he catches a lot of passes. But Bob plays the true
position.''

 &HT;    Ferreira rising among local pros
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _Ellis Ferreira, who finished in the top 10 of the world
doubles rankings for the second year in a row, and Richey Reneberg,
a Davis Cup hero, were the standout performers this year among
Atlanta's nine touring pros.
</P>
<P>
   Ferreira won three doubles titles _ including Atlanta's AT&AMP;T
Challenge _ and made the final of three others as he and former
world No. 1 Rick Leach wound up No. 5 in the team rankings.
Ferreira, 28, won a career-high $368,000 and eclipsed $1 million
for his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having two years in a row like this, it solidifies to yourself
and to your peers that you are a top-10 player,'' said Ferreira,
who finished No. 10 last year while teaming with Patrick Galbraith.
``And that I can do it with two different partners, that's very
encouraging. It shows I definitely belong in that crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   Reneberg, the former top-ranked doubles player who moved to
Atlanta a year ago, became the first player to win a Davis Cup
match in his place of residence since Andre Agassi did it in Las
Vegas in 1995. Playing against the Russians at Stone Mountain Park
in March, Reneberg and Todd Martin ended a five-match losing streak
for U.S. doubles teams and gave the U.S. a 2-1 lead en route to a
3-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   In singles, Reneberg, 33, dropped out of the top 100 for the
first time since 1988, but his doubles play rebounded. He was a
runner-up at Philadelphia with David MacPherson and at Indian Wells
with Martin and made seven semifinals. He finished No. 31 in
doubles, No. 154 in singles.
</P>
<P>
   Knee surgery in July kept him out of the U.S. Open, ending a
streak of 30 Grand Slam appearances in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Luke and Murphy Jensen, who finished last year No. 15 as a team,
had a 7-19 season and fell to No. 52 as a team, and the brothers
almost fell out of top 200 in individual doubles rankings. Luke,
appearing more comfortable as a tennis commentator these days, has
had two minor knee surgeries in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Former Georgia player T.J. Middleton made one doubles final, in
Marseilles, France, with Mark Keil, and reached a career-high of
No. 63 in June, but he was slowed by knee surgery. Middleton fell
out of the top 100 of doubles by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Flach beat Karol Kucera, ranked No. 12 at the time, while
making the quarterfinals of the Queens Club grass-court tournament
in London, but that couldn't keep him in the top 200. Flach did do
some damage in doubles, however, and finished at No. 99. Flach and
Sandon Stolle won an ATP Tour title in Newport, R.I., and Flach
also won USTA Challenger titles with Reneberg and David Witt.
</P>
<P>
   Wade McGuire's highlight was winning three matches to qualify at
Wimbledon. He didn't win a match in the main draw on the ATP Tour
for the year and finished No. 339.
</P>
<P>
   On the women's tour, Lindsay Lee won her first singles title in
three years, the USTA Women's Challenger of Burbank, Calif., but
her singles ranking fell for the third year in a row. Now age 21,
the former top-40 player stands at No. 186.
</P>
<P>
   The Jensens' younger sister Rebecca finished her second full
year on the tour and is No. 164 in doubles.

NETANYAHU APPEARS UNLIKELY TO STICK TO PEACE PLAN DEADLINES 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ After the thrill of presiding over a moment in
Palestinian history on Monday, President Clinton sank into a black
Barcalounger between the Israeli and the Palestinian leaders
Tuesday to endure the heated volley of their mutual recriminations.
</P>
<P>
   By the end, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel made it
clear that he was unlikely to abide by the peace plan's timetable,
which calls for another troop withdrawal from the West Bank on
Friday, a decision that was a disappointment for both the Americans
and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton, concluding a three-day visit here, nonetheless
pronounced the mission a success in putting the peace effort ``back
on track,'' although a senior adviser later qualified the
statement, describing the track as ``bumpy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have achieved what I came here to achieve,'' Clinton said,
referring mostly to the vote on Monday to eliminate calls for
Israel's destruction from the Palestinian charter.
</P>
<P>
   The visit came at a time of great distraction for both the
American and the Israeli leaders. Clinton faces an impeachment vote
by the House of Representatives on Thursday, and Netanyahu a
no-confidence vote next Monday that could topple his government.
</P>
<P>
   For each, the distractions provided distinct motivations.
Clinton was eager to burnish his role as an essential world
peacemaker. And Netanyahu, who fractured his right-wing coalition
by signing the peace plan in the first place, apparently calculated
that his best course was to talk tough and make no new concessions
until the Palestinians met all his demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace you only get if you insist the way we are insisting,''
he said Tuesday. ``Like we insisted and achieved the abolishment of
the charter.''
</P>
<P>
   Not even two months after Clinton and his advisers heralded the
signing of the peace plan, they found themselves touting as an
accomplishment the fact that they had cajoled the Israelis and the
Palestinians into conversing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've got them back talking to each other, which is
extremely important,'' Samuel R. Berger, the national security
adviser to Clinton, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the painstaking, cyclically backsliding reality of Mideast
diplomacy, even the fact of the three-way meeting was an
eleventh-hour accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   Before singing ``Deck the Halls'' with Yasser Arafat, the
Palestinian leader, in Bethlehem and touring Masada, a monument to
the ancient Jews, with Netanyahu, Clinton met with both men early
Tuesday morning at an army base near the military checkpoint that
separates Israel from Palestinian-controlled Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by advisers, each sat in a Barcalounger equipped with
a massage unit. But that was where the comfort ended.
</P>
<P>
   Haggling over why the peace effort had stalled, each Mideast
leader offered an assessment: The other did it. Netanyahu presented
a litany of 12 complaints, which his office later faxed to news
organizations. They ranged from what he said was the Palestinians'
failure to confiscate illegal weapons to their refusal to renounce
their intention to make a unilateral declaration of statehood.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis find Arafat's insistence on proclaiming Jerusalem
the future capital of the Palestinian state to be particularly
provocative. And, indeed, the supposed provocation was everywhere
in Gaza during Clinton's visit there on Monday. Banners spanning
streets read, in English, ``East Jerusalem is the capital of
Palestine.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu also protested the increased unrest in the West Bank
and Gaza, the most important issue for him. The unrest has grown
out of Palestinian discontent with the Israeli reluctance to
release people the Palestinians see as political prisoners. The
Israelis believe the Palestinian Authority foments the violence, in
which four Palestinians died last week after being shot by Israeli
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   On their end, the Palestinians demanded an end to the expansion
of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, the release of more
political prisoners, and the overdue opening of the safe-passage
corridor for Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, though, they pleaded for the freeze on the next
Israeli withdrawal to be lifted and the timetable kept _ something
the Americans reiterated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be very unfortunate if we got too far behind
schedule,'' Clinton said. He said that Secretary of State Madeleine
K. Albright will return within a few weeks to try to to keep the
peace efforts moving.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With no breakthrough in sight, the Palestinians expressed
exasperation with what they see as Netanyahu's determination to
sabotage the peace effort. After Monday's vote by the Palestine
National Council to cancel all clauses in its charter invoking the
destruction of Israel, the Palestinians felt they had made an
enormous concession to an Israeli demand and deserved something in
return.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians maintained that there was no reason to go
through the exercise of canceling the clauses, since they had
already done so in a meeting two years ago. Many said they did it
only to rob Netanyahu of an excuse to stall the Israeli withdrawal,
and then it apparently did not work.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is intentionally crushing all efforts that Clinton exerted
and is stopping the implementation of an agreement he personally
signed,'' said Marwan Kanafani, a senior aide to Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Some Israeli analysts said Netanyahu could not concentrate on
peace when he was fighting so fiercely for his political life and
that he would take no further steps until he knew what lay before
him.
</P>
<P>
   In a new development Tuesday night, his finance minister, Yaakov
Neeman, a professional appointee, resigned from the deeply
fractured Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu said he was not campaigning to survive the
no-confidence vote next week. ``I can tell you one thing,'' he
said, ``I don't run after any MPs,'' or members of Parliament.
``Whoever wants to join us, can join. Whoever doesn't want to,
that's his right.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton began his flight home, Israeli radio talk shows were
still debating his visit to Gaza, which many Israelis and
Palestinians alike saw not only as an endorsement of their
sovereignty but as a clear sign of a change in United
States-Palestinian relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of historical perspective, Clinton's trip will be
remembered for the Gaza part,'' said Uri Savir, a key negotiator of
the Oslo peace accord reached between Israel and the Palestinians
in 1993. ``It was almost an unbelievable event. And it made it
quite clear that the U.S.-Palestinian tie is based not only on what
is best for the peace process but on staking out a relationship
with the future state, on lining up a pro-American Arab partner.''

 STILL ONLY 50 STATES   (For use by New York Times News Service
clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Puerto Rico failed to endorse statehood on
Sunday, we were all spared a potentially inflammatory issue that
could have influenced the Hispanic vote in the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   A century after the United States took the island from Spain, a
majority of Puerto Ricans resisted their governor's campaign to
abandon their commonwealth status in favor of becoming our 51st
state. The outcome of the nonbinding referendum, however, was
sufficiently ambiguous that the question of Puerto Rico's future
has not been settled but merely indefinitely deferred.
</P>
<P>
   For several years there has been considerable bipartisan support
in Congress for an election in Puerto Rico to determine whether
residents want to be formally assimilated into the United States
with the full rights of citizenship. Congress has not officially
promised to accommodate the election results if statehood should
win, but political pressure to do so would be strong.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sunday's referendum offered confusing choices, it sends
a signal that the island is sharply divided over the question of
statehood. Half of the voters, 50.2 percent, opted for ``none of
the above'' while a slightly smaller 46.5 percent approved of
statehood. Supporters of the status quo went for ``none of the
above'' because they disagreed with the definition of the
commonwealth option offered elsewhere on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Pedro Rossello refused to concede defeat and promised to
continue his campaign to convince Congress that Puerto Rico should
be welcomed into the union. But his inability to muster
overwhelming local support means that Congress will follow its
usual cautious instincts and duck the hot potato for some time.
</P>
<P>
   Granting statehood to Puerto Rico is actually more popular among
our national political figures than it is at home. Presidents
Clinton, George Bush and Ronald Reagan as well as former House
Speaker Newt Gingrich and House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt
endorsed the change. Support for it is included in both parties'
1996 presidential platform.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties are more interested in appealing to the growing
numbers of mainland Hispanics _ expected to pass African Americans
as the largest minority group in 2005 _ than to the Puerto Ricans
on the island. Republicans in particular are nervous about their
poor showing with U.S. Hispanics, which stems largely from GOP
positions tightening immigration laws and weakening affirmative
action programs.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats think the newcomers would be mostly Democratic, as
mainland Hispanics now tend to be. But Hispanics do not necessarily
vote as a bloc and are often more conservative than Democrats on
some social issues, which encourages the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Commonwealth status means Puerto Ricans are American citizens,
given legal rights and the freedom to move about our country. But
they cannot vote for president and are allowed only one nonvoting
delegate in Congress. Individuals get a big bonus denied residents
of the 50 states _ they do not pay federal income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   They are prosperous by Caribbean standards. But as a state,
Puerto Rico would be the poorest, with an annual per capita income
of less than $8,000 a year _ only half that of Mississippi,
currently the poorest state. Roughly 60 percent of the island
population gets federal welfare assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., a member of the House International
Relations Committee, promptly warned that Congress is getting
restless about Puerto Rico's financial drain on the rest of us. He
vowed to ``re-evaluate the present federal subsidy,'' about $10
billion annually in welfare payments. He prefers that the island be
financially and legally independent or a tax-paying entity.
</P>
<P>
   The enthusiasm for statehood varies somewhat according to the
size of the state a legislator hails from. Puerto Rico would send
two senators and up to eight representatives to Congress, weakening
the clout of smaller states by the sheer addition of more members.
This is, in fact, no minor matter.
</P>
<P>
   But the toughest hurdle for Puerto Rican statehood is language.
An estimated 75 per cent of the island population does not read,
speak or understand English with any fluency. Spanish is pervasive
and has been the principal language of instruction in the schools
since 1949.
</P>
<P>
   This worries many folks. Two years ago, a House move to initiate
a plebiscite on the island died after a clause was added mandating
that statehood hinge on a shift to English as the primary language.
It was viewed as an attack on Puerto Rican culture, unenforceable
and probably illegal anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the specter of a state that cannot communicate with the rest
of the country in English is legitimately alarming. French-speaking
Quebec, which keeps threatening to separate from English-speaking
Canada, is an example of how competing languages can prevent the
growth of common ties that bind a country together.
</P>
<P>
   Rossello made English and Spanish officially equal in 1993, but
there is little evidence that Puerto Ricans are happily adapting to
new bilingual ways. Islanders are accustomed to their Spanish
culture. An evolution will take time _ a great deal of time.
</P>
<P>
   Yet language need not be a permanent barrier to the addition of
Puerto Rico as our 51st state. There is no urgency here. The
referendum indicates the island itself is not quite ready for the
change.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, this odd colonial relationship should end. It
offends like a dangling participle, untidy and out of whack.
Patience is required here.

<P>
   BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe _ On Monday, Amos Sibanda died in Mpilo
Hospital here, and his body was moved to its morgue.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives gathered at his tiny house cannot say exactly what
the 40-year-old man died of, but his death certificate can:
``encephalopathy and AIDS.'' He is the fourth member of his family
to die in 14 months.
</P>
<P>
   Sibanda, who could not read or write, made do for his wife and
five children by selling tomatoes, old clothes and fried fish on
the streets and repairing radios. He even owned a couple of cows,
but sold them in the last year to help pay for the funerals of his
father and two brothers. Now his family, its meager funds
exhausted, cannot raise the $46 it needs to get his body out of the
morgue and into the city cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Their worst fear, says Thamsanqa Magonya, the local ward
councillor, is that he will lie there until the hospital is forced
to cremate him. Mpilo's morgue is so crowded that it sometimes has
250 bodies stacked in space meant for 60. But cremation ``is taboo
in African culture,'' Magonya said. ``People don't want to burn
their relatives. They say, ``I don't want ashes _ I must see the
bones.''
</P>
<P>
   Across Africa, as the AIDS epidemic has gnawed through people
like a conqueror worm, the number of the dying is so great that it
is changing the culture of death itself.
</P>
<P>
   There are 5,500 AIDS-related funerals every day in Africa,
according to the United Nations. On a continent where a death has
always been a communal rather than a private matter, poverty and
emotional exhaustion are taking their toll. The poorest go
unshrouded a shovelful of ashes into a common pit.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of graves are left with no markers grander than the
favorite cup and spoon of the deceased, smashed in loving memory of
them. And people in all walks of life shamefacedly confess that
they no longer have the money or energy to mourn as they feel
African tradition demands.
</P>
<P>
   Some businessmen have made the best of this, and in cities like
Bulawayo, the funeral business is a golden industry in a blasted
landscape. Two years ago, the city _ whose name in Ndebele means
``the Place of Killing'' _ had four funeral homes. Now there are 14
registered ones, all owned by one family, plus an unknown number of
freelancers with a truck or two. Touts for the freelance homes used
to wander the wards of Mpilo Hospital until the chief
administrator, horrified by their ghoulishness, chased them out.
</P>
<P>
   In Africa, funeral rites take on far more importance than they
do in the West. The poorest domestic worker with no savings account
or pension will have one investment _ her burial society, a sort of
neighborhood club that in return for monthly payments her whole
life guarantees members of her family a dignified burial, with a
coffin, flowers and a generous meal for the mourners.
</P>
<P>
   Their finances pressed by the soaring death rate, burial
societies are changing rapidly. Ratidzai Chaumba, who runs one in
her Bulawayo neighborhood, said her ``joining fee'' had risen from
$3 to $25. Aunts and uncles of members no longer qualify as family,
nor do children over 24 years old. And to prevent people from
joining only when they are at death's door, there is now a macabre
``waiting period'' _ no one dying in the first three months is paid
for.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, Magonya said, anyone who fails to join a burial
society ``becomes an enemy of the people he is living with. Because
when you have a death problem, it becomes their problem.''
</P>
<P>
   African funeral rituals vary, but they usually involve bringing
the body into the home for at least one night, washing it, a public
viewing, a graveside service, a big meal for the mourners and a
weeklong period of mourning in which friends and relatives sleep in
the widow's room and around the house.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the funeral itself, the family is expected to pay for
the food and firewood, and some mourners even demand busfare home.
</P>
<P>
   Largely for that reason, funerals in most countries have become
radically shorter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customarily, if my brother died, my uncles, cousins and
grandmother used to come over and sleep at my house for a week to
console me and keep me company,'' said Jean Ngwira of a U.N.
project for HIV-infected people in Malawi. ``Now they only stay a
day or so.''
</P>
<P>
   In Uganda, said Dr. Donna Kabatesi, head of the Theta
AIDS-education project, the custom of showing respect when a
neighbor dies by not working in one's garden for four days has been
dropped. ``You can't afford to do that now,'' she said. ``You'd
have no food.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rachel Baggaley, a World Health Organization AIDS specialist
who spent six years working with farmworkers in Zambia, said big
funerals had ``become completely overwhelming for them. You had to
pay for food, and drink and charcoal. It could easily cost a
month's wages.''
</P>
<P>
   When she first saw farmers refusing workers a week off, she was
shocked at their hard-heartedness. ``Then,'' she said, ``I realized
that some workers were just incredibly relieved.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 5 p.m. Tuesday: The Red Flag Tells of a Death &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By 5 p.m. Tuesday, Sibanda's tiny house in the Emakandeni
township is surrounded by neighbors and relatives. Outside, a red
scrap of potato sack hangs from a tree branch, standing in for the
red flag raised when a house has had a death.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty men sit on benches outside, sharing a carton of sorghum
beer. The women sit inside with the widow, their bare feet forming
a tight circle on the floor of the two-room house as they silently
weave wreaths.
</P>
<P>
   Jecko Forbes Ndlovu, who lives next door, stands outside with a
small bowl and a sheet of paper, tallying the donations from
neighbors and visitors. Mrs. Chaumbai's burial society agrees to
donate $20 even though no Sibandas were members. That puts him over
the top: there will be enough for a coffin, so Sibanda's body can
be released.
</P>
<P>
   In rural areas, a few people are still interred the old way: a
man is buried sitting up, wrapped in a cowskin, deep beneath the
dung of his cattle kraal, or enclosure, while a woman is buried
next to her granary. That his how George Moyo, a wealthier neighbor
of Sibanda's, said he will be buried when his time comes. But Moyo
is the president of the Ndebele Cultural Society and a staunch
traditionalist. Sibanda's family, like most Africans nowadays,
wants a coffin.
</P>
<P>
   All across Africa, the coffin business has boomed. The roads out
of many cities are lined with trucks selling them. Furniture
companies have opened sidelines. Magazines advertise ``The Box,'' a
folding coffin that fits in a luggage rack.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the University Teaching Hospital mortuary in Lusaka,
Zambia, there is a row of corrugated iron sheds known as ``the
coffin showrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Nguni runs one, greeting customers while dressed in a
yellow shirt and red paisley tie. ``My boss only says I must be
smartly dressed,'' he said. ``Only those who work with the bodies
must wear black.''
</P>
<P>
   His wooden coffins sell for $13 to $260. Even the best still has
a flimsy lid held on by decorative screws. Other outlets sell
cardboard coffins, which have limitations: funerals have stopped
when the bottoms fall out.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest part, Nguni says, is dealing with big families.
``Someone is always drunk,'' he says, ``and their language is not
good. They tease you, saying, `You're happy when you see people
dying, aren't you?'''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Makandauko, a builder unloading 40 coffins from his
truck, said he has a chemistry degree, but no chance of a better
job in Zambia. ``When I first started, I had nightmares of dead
bodies,'' he said. ``But after maybe one week, I was used to the
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   His boss, Shailesh Patel of St. Ann's Funeral Home, says most
Zambians can't afford even their cut-rate coffins. ``They buy wood
themselves and hire a carpenter,'' he says. ``Or they break their
own furniture to make one.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 8:30 a.m. Wednesday: The Mourners Hire a Bus &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By 8:30 a.m. Wednesday, about 70 mourners have gathered at the
Sibanda house.
</P>
<P>
   Sibanda was ``a sociable guy, always making jokes with
friends,'' says his half-brother, Menford Nkomo.
</P>
<P>
   He was a gambler but not a drinker, says the Rev. Joel Dube of
the nearby Truth-Faith Mission, who will lead the service. ``He was
a good member of the community _ we had no trouble with him.'' When
he became ill, he left his traditional beliefs and ``came to our
church,'' Dube says.
</P>
<P>
   Sibanda's wife, Norah, seems stunned into silence. She is thin,
but there is no discussion of whether she too is infected. Two of
their children, including the 5-month-old baby, are not well,
relatives say.
</P>
<P>
   It is Sibanda's 17-year-old daughter, Margaret, who weeps
openly. Now there is no one to pay her $25-a-year public school
tuition, she says. Three of her friends have seen their parents
die, and had to drop out. Now they are maids, earning $8 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I had taken practical subjects at school, like
sewing,'' she says, staring hard at the ground. ``I could not,
because it cost more. You must buy your own materials.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the mourners have chipped in enough to hire a bus to
take them to the cemetery. A neighbor with a small truck comes to
fetch some male relatives. There are so many Sibandas in the
mortuary that the funeral service needs help picking out the right
one.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 10 a.m. Wednesday: The Undertaker Is Disgusted &LR;
</P>
<P>
   At 10 a.m., James Andrew of Future Funeral Services has
Sibanda's body in a cement back room of the African National Burial
Society, a small house across the street from Mpilo Hospital. He is
disgusted.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of people are these? They don't even provide a
pillow for his head. Look how it's wobbling. I can't fix this.''
</P>
<P>
   Sibanda's naked, skeletal body probably doesn't weigh 70 pounds.
But Andrew, who is working alone, doesn't even lift it out of the
coffin to the washing table. He wipes it perfunctorily with Lysol
and water, and calls for a blanket. The only one handy is wrapped
around the widow, who sits in a car outside. She wordlessly gives
it up.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew tucks it around the body and screws the lid on, pausing
at the last moment to spray in some air freshener.
</P>
<P>
   In the corridor, two women wail loudly, praying over the body
being washed in the next room.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is so silly,'' he mutters. ``Talking to a dead body. God
knows he is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew's indifference betrayed the erosion of other rites once
held sacred. For generations, body washing was always done by the
eldest members of the family. Love and respect were part of the
reason, said Sylvester Mubengwa, a human resources counselor in
Zambia, but it also ``reassured people that witchcraft was not
involved.'' The assumption, he said, was that an aged relative
would never steal body parts.
</P>
<P>
   The fear of witchcraft bankrupted the first owner of the African
National Burial Society, said Thabo Kunene, a local journalist.
``He was the first black person to start a funeral parlor in
Bulawayo,'' Kunene said. ``And people said: `Don't let the old man
visit your home. He's a witch.' The rumor was he was using medicine
to kill people so his business would boom.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there are many small black-owned funeral homes, like Future
Funerals. And AIDS has made death so familiar that fear of
witchcraft is no longer an issue. In fact, said Justin Chingono,
assistant manger of the Family Funeral home here, ``Death is now
discussed with children. In the old days, no young person _ even up
to the age of 18 _ was told that someone had died, or allowed to go
to a funeral.''
</P>
<P>
   But AIDS has also made many families afraid of the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Until a few years ago, said Charles Stephenson, a funeral
director in Lusaka, Zambia, ``it was a must that someone in the
family was there when the body was washed, even if our men did it.
These days they stay away and say ``Tell us when you're ready.''
</P>
<P>
   His own workers are scared, he said. ``Two years ago, my men
stayed in the same overalls all day. You had to battle to to get
them to have a bath every two or three days. Now, everybody's
become very hygenic. They wear their gloves. As soon as they do a
body, they want their overalls changed. You don't have to tell them
to have a bath before going home. Even the washbasins in our
changing rooms are sparkling.''
</P>
<P>
   Where there are unusual customs, they too have changed. Among
the Ganda, Uganda's largest tribe, mourners must bring a piece of
brown ``lubugo cloth'' made from the pounded bark of the mutuba
tree, to help wrap the body. But few artisans know how to make it,
so the cost has shot up to 10 times its pre-epidemic price, Dr.
Kabatesi said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 12:15 p.m. Wednesday: Eight Funerals at One Time &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By 12:15 p.m., the viewing at the house over, Sibanda's funeral
cortege heads for the cemetery. Other drivers ignore it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few years ago, all oncoming cars stopped as a sign of
respect,'' said Peter Stevens, Bulawayo regional manager for Dove's
Funeral Group. ``Now a hearse is just another vehicle.'' He has
even been honked at, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the gate, there is a traffic jam. Eight funerals are starting
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Although most Africans wish to be buried in their home villages,
that is often impossible. Refrigerated trucks willing to carry
bodies are rare and expensive, so desperate families try to bundle
relatives into long-distance taxis while they are still alive. But
other passengers often refuse to share a minivan with an
incontinent, sometimes tuberculotic invalid.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, all over Africa, urban graveyards are filling up.
Leopard Hill cemetery in Lusaka is full, as is Warren Park in
Harare, Zimbabwe. Municipalities are fighting to find land, and
warily suggesting cremation. The Mayor of Harare tried it, Magonya
said, ``and someone shouted, ``I think you're sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Once inside, five men climb off the bus to borrow shovels from
the main office. The grave is dug, but Future's fee does not
include filling it in.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the singing mourners are straining to make themselves
heard over a bigger chorus 200 feet away, which has a drum.
</P>
<P>
   By 12:50, the eulogies are over, Dube reminding mourners that
``Joining a burial society is joining Jesus Christ.'' The men take
turns filling the grave.
</P>
<P>
   There is no money for something that has become the newest
funeral expense for better-off families _ a layer of cement just
atop the coffin to keep thieves from digging it up to resell,
sometimes with the corpse's clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving to prepare the funeral dinner of cornmeal, stewed
mutton and onions, the women place their wreaths, already drying in
the sun, on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   They are the only marker. No one has brought Sibanda's favorite
eating utensils. The only headstone nearby is made of fresh cement.
On it, in the poorly spaced scrawl of a child on a new sidewalk, is
the deceased's name and age _ 35.
</P>
<P>
   It seems unlikely Sibanda will ever have even that.

DR. BOMBAY'S WISH LIST FOR THE ULTIMATE HIGH-TECH HOLIDAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You don't have to say a word. I can tell you're worrying
yourself to death, wondering what to get me for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose you could take the easy way out and send me the
customary $10,000 Hammacher Schlemmer gift certificate, but I know
you want to put more consideration into it than that. Why don't you
just pick out a few things from the following list? And please
don't feel obligated to get me everything. It's the thought that
counts.
</P>
<P>
   Don't listen to all the killjoys who say you should wait a year
or so before buying me an HDTV. Digital televisions with remarkably
clear pictures and booming stereo sound are here now, and I want
one. Sure, there may be next to nothing to watch on it, but what if
I miss something good?
</P>
<P>
   Buy it in stages. Start with the Panasonic TU-DST50 (about
$1,500), a set-top HDTV decoder that works with normal TVs. Slap
that on the old Philco (as long as it has video inputs), and the
box turns the digital broadcast into a regular TV signal with the
same quality as a DVD player's picture. That's handy, because I'm
not ready to toss my old-fashioned big-screen yet.
</P>
<P>
   The TU-DST50 will decode any of 18 kinds of digital signals a
broadcaster is likely to use, so don't worry about whether it will
work in my area. It also has an optical audio output so I can plug
it into the Digital Dolby stereo receiver you got me last year. I
know my neighbors will love hearing the ``Suddenly Susan'' theme
song at 120 decibels as much as they did ``Twister'' on DVD.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing this magic box doesn't have is a catchy
name. How about ``Bombay Box''? Just a thought. ...
</P>
<P>
   When you get your income-tax refund, you can spend it on the
second HDTV component, the digital-compatible TV. How about the
Bombay Box's stablemate, the Panasonic PT-56WXF90 (about $6,000)?
It's a 56-inch wide-screen projection TV with excellent resolution.
Plug the box into this set _ where there's no digital-analog
conversion to degrade the signal _ and I'll be watching ``Sabrina,
the Teenage Witch'' in wide screen in no time at all. Well, when
they get around to broadcasting it that way, that is.
</P>
<P>
   I guess if you had $15,000 to spare, you could get me the
Philips FlatTV to use as a monitor instead. That's the 42-inch TV
you hang on the wall like a picture. The box will plug into it,
too, and it's got a killer picture. In fact, the only thing wrong
with it is that it's not that easy to set empty beer cans or
pictures of Mama Bombay on top of it.
</P>
<P>
   One of the great things about Walkman-style headphones was that
I could pretend not to hear anyone I didn't want to talk to.
Unfortunately, those people could always stand right in front of me
until I was forced to notice them. Sony finally solves that problem
with the Glasstron Audio/Video Headset (900 bucks).
</P>
<P>
   OK, so I'll look like Geordi LaForge, but plug a video source
into these goggles, and it's supposed to be like watching a 52-inch
television from 6 feet away. To keep me from bumping into the wall,
there's an adjustment that will let a little of the outside world
in, but don't tell anybody. I don't want them to know I can see
them waving.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing spoils my television-watching experience like lukewarm
nacho cheese, so I'll always remember you fondly if you give me
GE's Mike (90 bucks), a tiny 500-watt microwave that would look
right at home on the end table next to my TV chair.
</P>
<P>
   There's only .3 cubic feet of oven space, but that's fine for
nuking a piece of pizza or a cup of coffee. You really should think
about getting me a second one for the office so I don't have to eat
this pastrami sandwich cold.
</P>
<P>
   I can't tell you how many times I've been sitting in a bus
station after midnight with the sudden urge to watch my ``Starship
Troopers'' DVD again.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Panasonic's DVD PalmTheater (about $1,400) comes to the
rescue. It's a portable DVD player with a built-in 5.8-inch
wide-screen monitor. The whole thing is about 6 1/2 inches square,
not too much bigger than a Discman. It'll do about everything the
big DVD players will, but it does it on batteries. Just keep an
extra set handy for the director's cut of ``JFK.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that I don't trust people. Really. I'd just feel a lot
better if I knew for sure they weren't blowing smoke. That's why I
want you to get me a Truth.Quest lie-detector phone from Sharper
Image (129 bucks).
</P>
<P>
   When somebody is lying, psychological stress supposedly causes
subtle changes in voice modulation. The Truth.Quest hears that and,
depending on the size of the whopper, lights up green, yellow or
red.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't want to buy the dorky-looking phone, you can get a
stand-alone Truth.Quest for 79 bucks that works with any telephone.
Can you imagine if these were standard government-office issue? Ken
Starr could have wrapped up that whole sordid mess in two weeks.

MOSCOW MAYOR REJECTS HATE GROUP RALLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In a snow-covered cabin in a wooded park on the
outskirts of Moscow, a group of men in black paramilitary uniforms
and red swastika arm-bands great each other with Nazi-style salutes
and sit down to discuss the politics of hate.
</P>
<P>
   This is the headquarters of Russian National Unity, an
ultranationalist fringe group whose ideologues propose an ``ethnic
Russian state'' that would impose ``Russian order'' and ``wholly
replace'' Jews and other minorities who have committed ``genocide''
against Russians.
</P>
<P>
   These ideas, printed in the group's newspaper ``Russian Order,''
strike an especially chilling chord in a country that lost 20
million people to Nazi invaders during World War II. But in the
crisis-ridden Russia of today, these ideas have support, and not
only among angry men with black shirts and crew cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Similar statements echo through the halls of the lower house of
parliament, the State Duma. Tuesday a senior member of the
Communist faction that dominates the Duma publicly suggested Jews
surrounding President Boris Yeltsin were responsible for what he
called a ``genocide'' of the Russian people.
</P>
<P>
   Russian National Unity wants to hold a congress in Moscow
Saturday, which organizers say will be attended by 5,000 followers
from across the country.
</P>
<P>
   But Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov, who hopes to win the Russian
presidency in 2000, Tuesday denied them permission, saying: ``Such
a meeting cannot and will not take place in Moscow.''
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov's police chief Tuesday retorted that he would use force
if necessary to stop the meeting. But all the mayor's policemen
cannot remove the deeper, more insidious prejudice in evidence at
all levels of Russian society.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after Luzhkov spoke Tuesday, the Duma's Committee on
Impeachment sat down to discuss how to remove Yeltsin from power.
</P>
<P>
   Viktor Ilyukhin, the Communist chairman of the Duma's security
committee, said the chaotic market reforms carried out by Yeltsin's
governments since 1992 had decimated Russia's population and
therefore qualified as genocide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The large-scale genocide would not have been possible if
Yeltsin's entourage and the country's previous governments had
consisted mainly of members of indigenous peoples rather than
members of the Jewish nation alone,'' Ilyukhin added.
</P>
<P>
   Communist and ultranationalist politicians often point to the
success of several prominent businessmen and politicians with
Jewish origins in what they say is a larger conspiracy to destroy
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most popular targets for such statements are Vladimir
Gusinsky and Boris Berezovsky, tycoons who control two of Russia's
main television stations and who also backed Yeltsin's reelection
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Both men belong to the ``oligarchs'' _ an informal group of
Kremlin insiders who acquired lucrative state property on the cheap
to build huge financial, industrial and media empires.
</P>
<P>
   Many Russians are angry that the ``oligarchs'' got rich while
most of the country became poor, and these are the emotions
Russia's extremists are trying to exploit. Naturally, the media
they own do not report the story this way. Berezovsky has called
for a ban on the Communist party. But that has only brought more
suspicion from millions of Russians who see the Communists as their
advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-semitism has a long history in Russia. It was encouraged by
the monarchy in Czarist Russia, which gave the world the term
``pogrom.'' Anti-Semitism was state policy under the Soviet Union
until the mid-1980s, under the thin guise of the official Soviet
term ``anti-Zionism.''
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the recent spate of anti-Semitimism is not state
policy, but a series of worrisome but relatively isolated events.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Communists helped block a motion in the Duma to
censure lawmaker Albert Makashov, a member of their faction who has
frequently called for reprisals against Jews. The Communist
governor of Krasnodar region in southern Russia has officially
restored ``anti-Zionism'' as his ideology.
</P>
<P>
   The national media has loudly protested, and many politicians
have joined the criticism. Even the Communists are split; a leading
Communist and a senior member of Yeltsin's cabinet, Yury Maslyukov,
Tuesday denounced Ilyukhin's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's government, spurred by an alarming rise this year in
skinhead attacks, and the bombing of a Moscow synagogue this
summer, has promised to crack down on ``extremism.'' But Yeltsin's
authority has been weakened by his many illnesses and the economic
crisis brought on by his government in August.
</P>
<P>
   And his Communist and ultranationalist opponents are unwilling
to pass on the chance to tap into public discontent racial hatred
provides them.

UNDATED: in two weeks. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When you pay as little attention to driving as I do, you have a
tendency to crash through the back wall of the garage. This can be
terribly embarrassing, especially the fourth time it happens. Well,
my contractor will just have to find work elsewhere once you buy me
Park-Zone from Exeter Technologies (80 bucks).
</P>
<P>
   This thing hangs on the garage wall and uses sonar to ping your
car. As you get closer, lights change from green to yellow to red,
telling you when to stop. Unfortunately, if you're still not paying
attention, you'll crash through the wall anyway, plus you'll kill
the Park-Zone.
</P>
<P>
   James Bond shouldn't have all the best toys. I want you to go
get me Sony's high-end 8mm camcorder, the Handycam Vision CCD-TRV99
(about $1,400). It has a night-vision system that will allow me to
tape stuff going on in total darkness up to 10 feet away. I'll
finally be able to tell what those odd noises coming from my
neighbor's window every night are.
</P>
<P>
   If you really love me, you'll make sure they throw in the
optional infrared illuminator, which will let me spy on them from
up to 100 feet away, which should be much safer. I think they have
a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike those crude, engraved brass nameplates you see on the
desks of Luddites everywhere, the LCD Name Plate from Brookstone
(45 bucks) has a rotating display: three screens of 16 characters
each. I can put my name on one, my title on the next and a cheerful
thought of the day on the third. And nobody says it can't be as
filthy as 16 characters will allow. I can get by with seven or
eight.
</P>
<P>
   Does your dog stink? My ex-dog Dave sure did, but who wanted to
wrestle a 100-pound lump of fur into the bathtub? I really wish
you'd been able to get me the Ionic Bath Pet Brush from Sharper
Image (49 bucks) last year while he was still around.
</P>
<P>
   Mysterious anti-stink rays are generated inside the handle of
this ground-breaking dog-hygiene tool. A five-minute brushing is
supposed to take the smell away. And nobody has said it can't be
used on humans. Think of it! I'll never have to take another
shower!
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure you've noticed how all those high-powered executroids
are waving their palm-sized personal organizers in each others'
faces. A lot of them are PalmPilots or Palm IIIs from 3Com, the
people who took Candlestick Park's name away.
</P>
<P>
   I'd rather you get me Philips' Nino 320 ($499). It's got 8MB of
memory to keep track of my hundreds of important social
engagements, plus it uses Microsoft's Windows CE operating system,
so it should be easy to transfer stuff to and from my PC. It comes
with all the software you'd expect on an organizer, plus it has a
built-in modem, so I can E-mail threats to various heads of state
no matter where I go.
</P>
<P>
   But the coolest thing is the built-in digital voice recorder,
perfect for all those times when I may not be lucid enough to write
down whatever pithy thing I happen to mumble.
</P>
<P>
   You simply must get me the LitterMaid Deluxe (about $200 in most
high-tech adult toy catalogs), a self-cleaning cat box. An electric
eye senses when Fluffy has done her business. Ten minutes later, a
sifting rake moves through the litter, clearing the clumps and
depositing them in an air-tight container.
</P>
<P>
   The thing runs on batteries or AC, although I'm not so sure
about letting a cat loose near live current. A frayed cord mixed
with one bad aim might add up to kitty fritters. I don't actually
have a cat, but I thought LitterMaid might be a nice addition to
the master bedroom. My prostate's not getting any younger, you
know.
</P>
<P>
   It really is getting to be a chore, rolling down the car window
to see what the temperature is like outside. Why don't you get me
the Wireless Auto Thermometer (60 bucks) from Brookstone?
</P>
<P>
   It's got a sensor that mounts on the back window and transmits
the temperature to a receiver installed on the dash. That way I'll
always know if it's too cold to drive through Jack-in-the-Box.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a grueling four-hour workday, I like something to
liven up the drive home, which is why TeleMania's Star Trek
Communicator Garage Door Opener (50 bucks) would be perfect for me.
Modeled after the classic ``Beam me up, Scotty'' communicator, it's
supposed to open justabout any garage door, maybe even my
neighbor's when he's not home.
</P>
<P>
   I wish they had a phaser to go with this. Those ceramic ducks on
his lawn really do need to be vaporized.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Electronics' Furby (30 bucks, as if you could actually
find one in the stores) is this year's must-have toy. If you don't
get one of these for your kid, you might as well not come home from
the mall.
</P>
<P>
   In case you've been living in a cave, a Furby is what you'd get
if you crossed a Tribble and a Tamagotchi: a sickeningly adorable,
artificially intelligent ball of fur that speaks to you and other
Furbies in a grating gibberish designed to drive adults clinically
insane within six hours.
</P>
<P>
   Do not buy me one of these.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't stop yourself, though, please also pick up the
ultimate Furby accessory: the Air Attack 2 aluminum bat (around
$230) from Hillerich &AMP; Bradsby, the Louisville Slugger people. It's
pressurized with nitrogen, and a newly designed air chamber and
large sweet spot make it the perfect tool for pounding any Furby
into its component molecules.

 &HT;    EXPERTS SAY GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE TO CYBERWAR IS TOO LITTLE AND
TOO LATE
 &HT;    680 words
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The government has responded to the threat of
cyberwar with ideas and policies that are outdated before they can
be implemented, a leading national security think tank warned
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Many officials fail to appreciate the dangers of ``weapons of
mass disruption,'' said analysts from the Center for Strategic and
International Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Terrorist organizations and doomsday sects with relatively
little financing could use computers and widely available know-how
to wage strategic information warfare against the United States,
tapping into sensitive military communications, disrupting air
traffic control centers, scrambling ``911'' calls and generally
sowing chaos in an increasingly computer-dependent society, the
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   In a 70-page report titled ``Cybercrime ... Cyberterrorism ...
Cyberwarfare,'' the center's Global Organized Crime Project urged
President Clinton to issue a sweeping executive order that would
start government wheels turning to prepare the country for an
imminent era of strategic information warfare.
</P>
<P>
   The report _ peppered with a new pair of post-Cold War acronyms,
``IW'' for information warfare and ``SID'' for strategic
information dominance _ warned that ``the possibility of an IW
attack is potentially equal to any threat the United States
faces.''
</P>
<P>
   The project, chaired by former federal judge William Webster,
who headed both the FBI and the CIA, includes former members of
presidential Cabinets, former CIA directors, retired military
leaders and current and former members of Congress, including
former Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn.
</P>
<P>
   Frank J. Cilluffo, director of the center's Information Warfare
Task Force, directed the team of analysts who wrote the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States ... has erected immensely complex
information systems on insecure foundations,'' the report warned.
``The economy is totally dependent on these systems. America's
adversaries and enemies recognize this dependency and are
developing weapons of mass disruption and mass destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   The report adds that Pentagon information warfare specialists
have estimated that for $10 million _ a fraction of the reported
wealth of America's most wanted transnational terrorist, Osama bin
Laden _ 30 computer wizards strategically located around the world
``could bring the United States to its knees.''
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. policy makers are responding to this 21st-century threat
with 20th-century thinking,'' the center said.
</P>
<P>
   Proposed responses have underestimated the IW threat, have
failed to take into account possible conflicts with information
revolution business interests or existing laws and have lacked
long-range strategy, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more significant failing of current policy is that it
focuses on vulnerabilities, not on long-term strategy for U.S.
security and dominance,'' the CSIS analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   The report said a presidential directive that goes beyond recent
orders is needed to start a top-down review of existing IW
responsibilities, develop both defensive and offensive IW policies
and identify high-priority functions for maintaining national
defense, rule of law, emergency preparedness and continuity of
government in the event of an attack.
</P>
<P>
   Because of overlaps between public and private institutions, the
analysts urged the government must do more to enlist cooperation of
telecommunications and information industries, not merely to
protect against attack but also to provide talent for building
protective infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to protect the country against IW should be part of a
broader review of the impact of the information revolution on
national security, the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To date, no U.S. policy review has considered how the
information revolution has affected the country's beliefs about
security or proper preparations for dealing with such threats,''
the report stated.
</P>
<P>
   Organized in 1962 and originally affiliated with Georgetown
University, CSIS is now an independent research institution
focusing on international policy issues.

EPA THREATENS PENALTIES OVER BAY STATE AUTO EMISSIONS INACTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Frustrated by Massachusetts' slow progress in setting
up a high-tech auto inspection program, the US Environmental
Protection Agency plans to punish the state within the next few
months, severely restricting the construction of new power plants
and other industrial facilities that pollute the air.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts officials admit they are unlikely to meet a May
deadline to begin the testing program, which will use both
highway-mounted sensors and garage inspections to get polluting
cars off the road. The Cellucci administration still is
negotatiating a contract for the testing equipment, and trying to
pay for it without raising annual inspection fees above $20.
</P>
<P>
   But, after four years of discussions with the state about
tougher vehicle inspections, EPA officials say their patience is
thin, and they may punish the state long before May if they are
convinced the Cellucci administration is deliberately stalling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very hesitant to initiate sanctions against the
Commonwealth. Of all the ways of solving this problem, it is the
least satisfactory,'' said John DeVillars, EPA's New England
administrator. ``But we will very soon be left with no other
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   More sophisticated vehicle inspections are a key part of the
national effort to curb summertime smog, but they have provoked
repeated showdowns between EPA and some states. Maine abruptly
closed its vehicle testing centers amid complaints about the cost,
inconvenience and high failure rate in 1995, prompting EPA to back
off on the issue for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the prospect of EPA sanctions alarms industry officials,
who fear that Massachusetts' economy will be punished for the
failure to crack down on motor vehicle exhaust. Up to 15 proposed
natural-gas burning power plants _ billed as a cleaner, cheaper way
to provide electricity than the coal- or oil-fired plants they
would replace _ could be delayed under EPA sanctions that would
require the state to eliminate twice as much pollution as the
plants would emit.
</P>
<P>
   EPA sanctions have ``significant implications on how clean the
air is and on the competitive electricity world we are all looking
toward,'' said Robert Ruddock, executive vice president of the
Associated Industries of Massachusetts. ``Frankly, we can't afford
to have that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials say they aren't looking for a fight, and blame
the delays in the program on the changing technology of pollution
detection. They note that EPA has repeatedly changed its technical
requirements for the inspection programs, providing detailed
guidance on the use of highway-mounted sensors that analyze car
exhaust only last May.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, officials in the Executive Office of Administration
and Finance are concerned at the estimated $215 million cost of the
contract being negotiated with Keating Technologies of Phoenix and
the possibility of a driver revolt if the cost of an inspection
sticker rises significantly from the current $15.
</P>
<P>
   ``We absolutely take EPA seriously about the issue of sanctions
and we are acutely aware of the timeline,'' said Assistant
Environmental Affairs Secretary John Rodman, who hopes the new
inspection program will start by summer, but would not promise it.
``We are not looking for a fight.''
</P>
<P>
   The clash between Massachusetts and federal regulators over car
inspections began in 1994 when EPA threatened to withhold highway
funding for the Central Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel project if the
Legislature didn't create a new emissions testing system where cars
would be sent to one of 50 testing centers equipped with machines
that detect chemicals in car exhaust far more accurately than
current technology.
</P>
<P>
   Before Massachusetts could set up the system, however, drivers
in Maine rebelled against similar testing centers, prompting the
governor to close them. EPA quickly backed away from the old
testing scheme and began looking for new options.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Massachusetts air has gotten cleaner, and regulators
have come up with more consumer-friendly ways to test vehicle
exhaust. Under the current Massachusetts plan, drivers would go
every other year to one of 600 to 1,200 inspection stations for the
high-tech emissions tests, as part of their annual safety
inspection.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 20 percent of drivers wouldn't need an emissions test at
all because their emissions would be checked by highway-mounted
pollution sensors using infrared or lasers to analyze exhaust
gases. The sensors would only record vehicles that meet the
standards, requiring vehicles that fail to be tested in inspection
centers.
</P>
<P>
   But negotiating the deal with Keating Technologies has been
tricky because state officials are unsure how many inspection
stations will want testing equipment, making it difficult to set a
contract price _ or to calculate how much motorists must pay to
cover the cost of the program.
</P>
<P>
   However, Rodman said state officials want ``no significant
increase for the motorist'' for an inspection sticker, which he
said would be no more than a few dollars increase.
</P>
<P>
   While Massachusetts deliberates, EPA officials point out that
many other states, such as Connecticut, have already begun the new
tests, reducing smog in the process. Said EPA's DeVillars, ``It's
time to get out of neutral and into the fast lane with an
economically and environmentally sound program.''

NEW HEART-EXERCISE STUDY MEETS CONTROVERSY  
 STUDY DETAILS BENEFITS  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eating a diet rich in vegetables and almost devoid of fats,
doing three hours of workouts a week, meditating, and making other
ambitious lifestyle changes can delay, stop, and even reverse the
course of heart disease, according to a controversial new report.
</P>
<P>
   And rather than diminishing over time, the benefits expand, says
the study, led by best-selling author and California cardiologist
Dean Ornish. The opposite was true for a control group of patients
pursuing more moderate treatments, many of whom saw their condition
worsen over the five years they were followed.
</P>
<P>
   Most subjects in what admittedly was a small study also were
able to sustain their ambitious lifestyle changes for the full five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing before has looked at lifestyle changes over this long
a period,'' says Ornish, who helped develop a line of foods that
adhere to his low-fat criteria. ``In our study, patients got better
and better in our experimental group but worse and worse in the
control group, which shows that conventional American Heart
Association guidelines do not go far enough unless you also take
drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of his fellow cardiologists, however, take exception to
Ornish's scientific methods, question the safety of some therapies
he recommends and, most of all, wonder how many patients will
participate in a program that requires such dedication. ``The
question is not whether or not it works, but how implementable it
is,'' says Dr. Thomas Pearson, chairman of community and preventive
medicine at the University of Rochester and a spokesman for the
American Heart Association.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published in the current Journal of the American
Medical Association, is a followup to one Ornish published after a
single year of monitoring the patients, all of whom had moderate to
severe heart disease. Twenty of 28 patients in the original study
receiving aggressive treatment stuck with it through the five-year
followup, continuing to eat a 10 percent fat vegetarian diet, walk
about a half an hour a day, meditate or use other stress-reduction
techniques, and not smoking. Fifteen of 20 patients lasted the full
five years in the moderate-response group, most of whom ate more
fat and did fewer workouts, while some took cholesterol-lowering
drugs and had angioplastic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Patients getting intensive treatment fared better on most
measures considered: They suffered less than half the rate of heart
attacks and other cardiac events at the end of five years, recorded
twice the reduction in angina, and saw their blood vessels getting
healthier, whereas those on the moderate course saw their blood
vessels constricting.
</P>
<P>
   Even more telling, Ornish says, is the trend with coronary
artherosclerosis between the one-year study and this new five-year
one: It got better among those on the intensive therapy, and
worsened for those on the more moderate program.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Charles Hennekens, chief of preventive medicine at
Brigham and Women's Hospital, says much of what Ornish reported
already was known. He also worries that Ornish's report is based on
too few patients to draw meaningful conclusions, that the treatment
programs were so demanding it ensures many patients will drop out,
and that because all the lifestyle changes were lumped together it
is impossible to tell which were more beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frank Sacks, a professor of medicine and nutrition at
Harvard who has overseen several major heart studies on diet and
drugs, has an additional concern: that Ornish's program could be
dangerous with untested recommendations, like the one recommending
exercise to patients with heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Ornish has his defenders, however, including Dr. James Morgan,
chief of cardiology at Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital, which
participated in the Ornish program until funding dried up several
years ago. ``There's no question in my mind that it works,'' says
Morgan. ``It really depends on a person's nature whether they can
prescribe to this very, very rigorous program.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rennie Drummond, deputy editor of JAMA, also is intrigued by
what Ornish found: ``If the findings are true, and if they are
confirmed by others, they could by important, very important. . . .
This is an intervention that doesn't require drugs and doesn't
require surgery for one of the commonest and most disabling and
most death-dealing diseases.''

MIDEAST TRIP SEEMS TO DISTANCE CLINTON FROM IMPEACHMENT WORRIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Near the end of his uniquely stressful Middle
Eastern trip, with the second House impeachment vote in history
looming before him on his return to Washington, President Clinton
unaccountably grinned Tuesday when asked how he managed, as he
claimed, to insulate the peace effort from his deepening political
woes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You show up for work every day,'' he said, his eyes crinkling
up. ``It's not a complicated thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who accompanied Clinton here, said:
``He's boring in. It may well be that his collateral problems are
giving him more motivation for success here.'' On the flight here
on Saturday, Specter said the president ``projects obliviousness''
about impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was a puzzle during this trip, even to some of his
aides. He was clearly concerned about the impeachment vote,
occasionally checking on his position in calls to the chief of
staff, John D. Podesta, or one of his congressional experts, Steve
Ricchetti. But when forced by reporters to address the matter, he
seemed almost indifferent, and gave sullen answers that risked
tipping away the fence-sitters whose support he needs.
</P>
<P>
   He appeared able to put the matter completely out of his head.
Tuesday afternoon, his helicopter flew between tourist stops
commemorating Christian hope in the city of Bethlehem and Jewish
martyrdom on the mountaintop of Masada, where ancient Israeli
soldiers killed themselves rather than surrender to the Romans. The
president gave no outward sign that he absorbed the symbolism. In
transit, he sat quietly reading ``The History of the Jews,'' by
Paul Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last three days, Clinton gave two powerful, if somewhat
controversial, speeches on reinvigorating the peace effort, while
patiently shepherding Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime
minister, and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, back to the
bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
   James Zogby, the president of the Arab American Institute, spoke
with Clinton at lunch in Gaza City on Monday, and found him wound
up about his address later that day to the Palestinian National
Council. ``I think he was totally with the moment,'' Zogby said.
``He gets into that teaching mode, you know, that he gets into. He
was there.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Tom DeLay, the House majority whip, warned on Sunday
that the president was losing authority in foreign affairs,
Specter, a firm supporter of Israel, called the trip ``a
significant success.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has long deflected scandal and sustained his popularity
by focusing on his official duties and generating appealing
television images of himself and his family. But that approach
seems unlikely to help him much with his critical constituency now,
perhaps 30 undecided members of the House.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides acknowledged that the signs from Congress were
not positive for Clinton. ``You've got guys that we thought we
could get that have come out against us,'' a senior aide said.
``There are some people who are with us who seem to be softening.''
But ``the bottom line,'' he added, was that many members of the
House still had not declared a position.
</P>
<P>
   While they were in the Middle East, Clinton never spoke to his
congressional delegation about the possibility of impeachment,
according to Specter and White House aides. Indeed, it seemed on
Tuesday night that Clinton might drop his seeming indifference to
impeachment upon returning to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM HERE)
</P>
<P>
   While he and the congressmen did talk about other matters,
ranging from steel prices to scientific discoveries regarding stem
cells, they dwelled mostly on the peace effort, as they did during
a meeting for more than an hour over coffee and dessert on Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has focused,'' Specter said this evening as Clinton left.
``He's been very, very good.'' Of course, the deep hatreds, deadly
threats and freighted negotiations here would seem likely to focus
even an easily distracted mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's certainly energized by the trip,'' one of Clinton's
senior aides said. But at the same time, said another of his
advisers, also speaking on condition of anonymity, ``he's quite
aware of what's going on back home.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's tourism Tuesday seemed calculated more to advance the
peace effort than anything else, though the images of family comity
might also have pleased some Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In Bethlehem, with Arafat, Clinton managed to squeeze himself
through the 4-foot-high ``Door of Humility'' to enter the Church of
the Nativity. The president and his family spent about 10 minutes
in the basement, by the 14-point silver star that is said to mark
the spot where Jesus was born.
</P>
<P>
   In a striking demonstration of the strengthening relations
between the United States and a man it once treated as a terrorist,
Arafat and his wife, Suha, then stood side by side with the
Clintons as a choir of children sang ``O Little Town of Bethlehem''
and ``Joy to the World.'' Standing between her parents, Chelsea
looked up at her father with a big smile.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons then flew to Masada, a stark mountaintop by the
Dead Sea that is one of the Jews' most revered monuments to their
ancient struggle. For several months beginning in A.D. 72, a group
of 967 Jewish zealots held out there against a Roman siege before
their eventual suicides.
</P>
<P>
   With Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, the Clintons toured the site,
taking in the view of the Dead Sea and the Moab Mountains, and had
a traditional Middle Eastern meal of small mezze dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Every now and then in the last three days, Clinton has seemed to
veer in his public remarks toward an observation that applies as
easily to his predicament at home as to the peril here. In a toast
here on Sunday night, he said that during the mid-1980s, his former
pastor told him that he might be president some day.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will make mistakes,'' he recalled the pastor as having
said, ``and God will forgive you. But God will never forgive you if
you forget the State of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   He closed with a remark that could easily be read as a plea to
the House. ``We are instructed that they who judge without mercy
will be judged without mercy,'' Clinton said. ``But mercy triumphs
over judgment.''

 &HT;    SOME AIDES URGE CLINTON TO MAKE PERSONAL PLEA TO HOUSE
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Some White House advisers are urging President
Clinton to make a bold move to avert impeachment, such as going to
the well of the House and delivering a personal plea for censure,
former Clinton aide Lanny Davis said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal came as Clinton, who was flying back from Israel on
Tuesday, prepared to spend Wednesday seeking compromise with a
rapidly dwindling number of Republican moderates.
</P>
<P>
   There was no indication that he or first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton planned to speak publicly on the impeachment topic, though
aides refused to rule it out.
</P>
<P>
   At a breakfast with reporters, Davis said a Clinton trip to
Capitol Hill could be effective because ``the president can make
his case in person before the full House better than anyone. He
should expose himself to that process, answer questions and be
prepared to acknowledge the reality of what he has done.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said such a move, which would include an admission that he
had been ``less than truthful'' in testimony about his sexual
liaisons with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, may be the
only way left for the president to avoid becoming the second
president in U.S. history to be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   The House convenes Thursday to begin considering four
impeachment articles, but the president has not decided whether to
follow advice that he address the members, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't embraced any particular proposal, but we generally
do welcome any opportunity to bring this to some bipartisan
closure,'' said White House spokesman Jim Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   It was reported by CNN that White House aides negotiated on
terms of a censure resolution proposed Tuesday by Rep. Michael
Castle of Delaware, a moderate Republican with close ties to
Clinton dating back to their days as governors.
</P>
<P>
   That resolution would require Clinton to ``personally'' pay $2
million over five years to defray half the $4 million expense of
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's eight-month inquiry into the
president's affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   However, Republican House leaders have indicated they will not
allow a vote on censure as an alternative to the impeachment votes
expected Thursday or Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It was also unclear Tuesday whether the leaders would Clinton to
make the House appearance suggested by his aides.
</P>
<P>
   But ``there are a lot of things in motion,'' said Rep. John
Conyers of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what happens in the House may depend on the outcome of
the president's planned meeting Wednesday with Rep. Christopher
Shays, a Connecticut Republican who once opposed impeachment but is
now wavering.
</P>
<P>
   Shays has said he wants Clinton to confess that he lied under
oath. But as a practical matter, the president is unlikely to offer
any such statement unless Shays shows he can deliver enough
moderate GOP votes to block impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the president's advisers have given up hope of stopping
impeachment and are preparing to fight it out in the Senate, said
Davis, a former White House special counsel. But a dramatic and
unprecedented appearance in the House by the president could still
sway enough moderate Republicans to avert a Senate trial of the
House-approved articles of impeachment, he insisted.

DEMOCRATS LOOK TO SENATE TO THWART IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With an increasing number of House Republicans
supporting impeachment, Democrats are exploring the possibility of
heading off a Senate trial through parliamentary maneuvers or a
bipartisan censure vote.
</P>
<P>
   While much attention has been paid to the expectation that the
Senate would vote to acquit Clinton, White House aides in recent
days have become concerned that a trial, in itself, could
politically strangle the presidency and galvanize public support
for Clinton's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials and Democrats Tuesday seized on a
suggestion by Clinton's former rival, 1996 Republican presidential
nominee Bob Dole, that the House and Senate adopt a joint
resolution calling for Clinton's censure. Senate Democrats are also
studying if they could muster 51 votes for a motion to dismiss the
impeachment articles before a trial starts.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Joseph Lieberman, the Connecticut Democrat, said the
Senate has ``no choice'' other than to start a trial, but he
suggested the articles could be dismissed shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of doubt about the procedures in a trial in the
Senate,'' Lieberman said. But, he said, it ``is clear that a
majority of the Senate will determine what should happen. What I
mean is that the rules provide for a motion to adjourn. One or
another party, presumably the defense counsel, could move to
dismiss, and then that's up to a majority of the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole, in an op-ed page column in Tuesday's New York Times,
suggested the Senate could suspend the impeachment rules and allow
a vote on a House-Senate resolution censuring the president.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether there is a way to cancel the Senate trial.
But Democrats have one thing in their favor in the Senate: It takes
67 of 100 votes to convict a president, and Republicans hold only
55 seats. ``There is scarcely anyone who believes that the required
67 senators would vote to convict the president on any of the four
articles of impeachment approved by the House Judiciary Committee,
notwithstanding what the full House might do,'' Dole wrote.
</P>
<P>
   If the Republican leadership is convinced there is no chance to
convict Clinton in the Senate, then it might want to avoid a
months-long trial that many analysts believe could hurt the
Republican Party as well as the president. But GOP aides said it
seemed unlikely that both the House and Senate of the outgoing
105th Congress could agree on a joint resolution of censure by Jan.
2, as Dole suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Other options are also being studied. For example, Senator
Joseph Biden, the Delaware Democrat, is among a group of Clinton
supporters examining Senate procedure for a way to dismiss the
impeachment articles by a majority vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a will, there's a way, as long as you are not
dumbing down the Constitution,'' said Senator John F. Kerry, when
asked if a trial could be avoided. But the Massachusetts Democrat
said a major problem for him and other senators is that little
information has been distributed about the procedures surrounding a
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to suggest something that is constitutionally
impermissible,'' Kerry said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if there is a way for the Senate to dismiss the impeachment
articles, such an effort probably could succeed only if Senate
majority leader Trent Lott allows a vote. If Lott wants a trial to
proceed, there may be no way for Democrats to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, asked recently whether the Senate must have a trial, left
the door open a crack: ``Do we have to? I don't think absolutely,
but I think it would be hard not to do that if the House votes one
or more articles'' of impeachment, Lott said. At another point, he
said, ``I think the Senate will have a trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, even if there is a trial, a Republican leadership aide
said it appears that any senator could make a motion at any time to
suspend it. If there are 51 votes _ presumably all 45 Democrats and
six Republicans _ then the trial would be suspended indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could conceive of that 51 number, but I can't conceive it
right away,'' said the aide, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The White House is looking at whether a Senate trial could be
averted by a plea bargain agreement in which Clinton admits
wrongdoing and accepts a Senate rebuke and penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Lott is expected to meet with Senate Democratic leaders after
the House vote to discuss procedure for an impeachment trial. Under
the current plan, the Senate would meet around Jan. 6 and formally
receive the articles from the House.
</P>
<P>
   The length of the trial would depend partly on White House
strategy. While Lott has said he would like the trial to be over in
a few weeks, it could take longer if either side calls numerous
witnesses. Senators are discussing whether certain normal courtroom
rules apply, such as the ability of each side to participate in the
``discovery'' process, during which evidence would be examined and
depositions might be taken.

the number of the dying is so great that it is changing the culture
of death itself. There are 5,500 AIDS-related funerals every day in
Africa, according to the United Nations. On a continent where death
has always been a communal rather than a private matter, poverty
and emotional exhaustion are taking their toll. The poorest go
unshrouded into a common pit. Thousands of graves are left with no
markers grander than the favorite cup and spoon of the deceased,
smashed in loving memory of them. And people in all walks of life
shamefacedly confess that they no longer have the money or energy
to mourn as they feel African tradition demands. By Donald G.

CLINTON FAILS TO BUDGE ISRAEL FROM ITS ULTIMATUM DURING MIDEAST
TRIP 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ President Clinton claimed achievements for peace
Tuesday but failed to budge Israel from its ultimatum that no more
territory will be ceded to Palestinians until they renounce
statehood declarations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton flew to the sandswept military outpost of Erez to meet
with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat in an attempt to get a U.S.-brokered peace
plan back on track.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Clinton's pronouncements before he returned to
Washington, the status of the Wye River peace agreement remained
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   After the 90-minute session at the Israeli-Gaza Strip border,
Clinton said progress had been made but Arafat left hurriedly
without talking to reporters and Netanyahu reiterated his intention
to delay a troop withdrawal from occupied West Bank lands that was
supposed to take place Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be unfortunate if we got too far behind
schedule, and I hope we can keep pretty much to the schedule that's
there,'' Clinton said following the meeting. ``I do think that we
are back on track. We're going to see this through, and I feel good
about where we are now.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will
return to the region next week to continue negotiations. ``So I
have achieved what I came here to achieve ... and we'll just keep
at it,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president's national security adviser, Samuel ``Sandy''
Berger, later tempered Clinton's remarks, adding that ``I think
it's a bumpy track, but it's (the peace process) on track.''
</P>
<P>
   The three-way summit capped Clinton's visit to the Middle East
to revive the Wye River Memorandum that called on Israel to
withdraw troops from an additional 13 percent of the West Bank in
return for security guarantees from Palestinians. The marathon
negotiations at the Maryland retreat came after 18 months of
stalemate between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   The accord became unsettled last month as Israel refused to
release Palestinian prisoners it considered terrorists, prompting
several violent confrontations from stone-throwing Palestinian
youths.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Netanyahu faces a no-confidence vote Monday from
hard-liners opposed to the Wye River provisions, and several
Israeli media &UR;  &LR; reports indicated the prime minister wanted to delay
further troop withdrawals in hopes of averting his government's
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a redeployment speedily, as soon as the
Palestinians fulfill their part,'' Netanyahu told reporters. ``I
can't tell you how much time it will take, but the faster they do
it, the faster we will redeploy.'' He denied taking the stance to
help his political situation.
</P>
<P>
   During the Erez session, the prime minister gave Clinton and
Arafat a 12-point list of alleged violations to the Wye River pact
by the Palestinians. The list restated Netanyahu's demand that
Arafat renounce intentions to declare a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from Netanyahu's office also listed demands that the
Palestinian Authority crack down on violence, stop incitements,
accept Israel's prisoner release criteria, seize weapons and reduce
the size of the Palestinian police force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are waiting for the Palestinians to respect the rest of
their obligations,'' Netanyahu said. ``All that they have done
until now is contrary to their commitments.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians, who made a symbolic gesture Monday as they voted
to rescind charter provisions calling for Israel's destruction,
were angered by the turn of events.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat adviser Marwan Kanafani criticized Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is intentionally crushing all efforts that Clinton exerted
and is stopping the implementation of an agreement he personally
signed,'' Kanafani said. ``What Netanyahu constantly repeats in his
statements further reinforces the doubts of the Palestinian people
about his intentions to carry out the peace agreements.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Clinton said he saw significant progress from talks
with Netanyahu and Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the two sides agreed to create an informal channel
to deal with the difficult issue of prisoner releases as well as to
``vigorously pursue the security issue'' and ``energize'' the final
status talks. That last round of negotiations, required under the
1993 peace treaty, would attempt to resolve even more difficult
issues such as the status of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have fits and starts, there will be hard parts, but
we'll get though this. We'll get through this just fine and it will
come out where it ought to,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the president left the region with many Israelis also
upset that his historic journey to the Gaza Strip on Monday was a
tacit endorsement of Palestinian statehood. Many also are upset by
Clinton's speech to the Palestinians in which he equated the pain
of Palestinian children whose fathers were jailed to the pain of
Israeli children whose fathers had been killed in conflict. The
remark was part of a plea to end the suffering of children on both
sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made clear to the president that his remarks caused deep
shock among Israelis,'' said Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon, a hard-liner, refused again to shake hands with Arafat,
whom he refers as a murderer.
</P>
<P>
   After the session in Erez, Clinton flew to the West Bank city of
Bethlehem where he joined first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and
daughter Chelsea for a tour of the Church of the Nativity, site of
Jesus Christ's birth. Arafat and his wife, Suha, escorted the
Clintons through the church.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons also flew to Masada where they joined Netanyahu for
a tour of the symbol of Jewish resolve. The mesa is where 960 Jews
chose death rather than surrender to Romans.

   BIOTECH-MARKETPLACE (Los Angeles) _ The biotechnology industry
is facing a financial reckoning. Investors, disappointed by the
financial returns the industry has provided so far, are growing

ASIAN LEADERS EXPECTED TO EASE TRADE, INVESTMENT RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   HONG KONG _ Over the last year and a half, everyone from Asian
prime ministers to American politicians to international fund
managers has offered solutions to a vexing financial crisis that
has ravaged what was the world's fastest-growing region.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Southeast Asian leaders are expected to liberalize
trade and investment rules to lure money back to Asia. Leaders of
the nine-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations meeting in
Hanoi will present a package of immodestly labeled ``bold
measures,'' including corporate tax exemptions, permission for
foreign ownership of certain ventures and tariff reductions.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath ASEAN's veneer of consensus lies a widely
contradictory set of economic policies, and a deep philosophical
divide over whether the best way to overcome the economic turmoil
is by opening markets or closing them.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, seventeen months into Asia's worst financial crisis in
half a century, leaders are still debating whether free markets
were not only the cause of record growth but also the root of
financial vulnerability and collapse. The lack of a coherent,
consistent response to the slump suggests that a reliable diagnosis
and region-wide recovery are a long way off.
</P>
<P>
   ``When consensus forms, there's stability. When there's no
consensus, there's volatility,'' said Christopher Lingle, an
economist and author of The Rise and Decline of the Asian Century.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over how to address the crisis also underscores
a clash of ideologies _ over free markets versus protectionism and
democracy versus authoritarianism. That debate has become a
generational tug-of-war, as many older and entrenched leaders have
tried to hold back modernization, while newly elected or younger
leaders have mostly pushed for reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The authoritarianism that everybody was praising for so long
as Asian values _ with leaders like (Singapore's) Lee Kuan Yew and
(Malaysia's) Mahathir Mohamad _ was just a way of justifying an
authoritarian government,'' said Ken Davies, an economist and chief
Asian editor of the Economist Intelligence Unit. ``Now the theory
is being disproved by Asians themselves _ by the Taiwanese, the
South Koreans and the Thais.''
</P>
<P>
   A dramatic dichotomy over how the address the crisis has emerged
between ASEAN members Thailand and Malaysia. Thai Prime Minister
Chuan, who last year unseated a government that presided over the
collapse of the Thai currency, has liberalized markets and
restructured financial institutions. Despite political opposition
at home, he has won praise for adhering to reforms demanded as
conditions of a multi-billion-dollar International Monetary Fund
bailout.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir has blamed
foreign speculators for his nation's problems, and three months ago
alienated international investors by imposing capital controls to
protect markets from outside influences. He also infuriated Western
governments by jailing his free market-oriented finance minister on
sodomy and corruption charges, a move Mahathir's critics say he
took to defend his dwindling authority.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Malaysia's much-maligned response to the crisis has not been
entirely one-sided. Even as Mahathir criticized foreign
stockbrokers, he liberalized foreign ownership of stock brokerages
and telecom companies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, whether a government reacts in the main to the crisis by
turning inward or outward depends on what leaders see as the root
of their woes. ``Mahathir's view is that this is the result of
speculators, so his solution is to stop speculators. But if you
take the view that this is only part of it, and there were other
structural problems, then you will try to solve those structural
problems as Thailand and South Korea are trying to do,'' said Bruce
Gale, Southeast Asia regional manager for Political and Economic
Risk Consultancy.
</P>
<P>
   The divergence between Asian neighbors over how to solve the
crisis has repeated itself elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   After Hong Kong's government intervened in the stock market to
defend its currency in August, rival city-state Singapore cut
capital ratio requirements and investor incentives to capitalize on
Hong Kong's apparent backsliding on free-market principles. The
policy debate came into stark relief two weeks ago when the
Washington, D.C.-based Heritage Foundation warned Hong Kong that it
would lose its title as the world's freest economy to Singapore
because of the $15 billion stock buying spree.
</P>
<P>
   There are many investors, however, such as Giampaolo Guarnieri,
director of Asia Pacific equities for Salomon Smith Barney, who say
Hong Kong has done nothing to restrict capital or investment. Even
after Hong Kong's market intervention, he said, it is still a freer
and more transparent place to do business than anywhere else in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Singapore is a place where the government intervenes in
everything _ you can't even chew gum. Right now they happen to be
intervening to make the economy better, so that's good _ but it's
still intervention,'' Guarnieri said. Nevertheless, he praised
efforts there and elsewhere to open markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend is for economies to basically open up, allow more
foreign investment in various sectors, which is new in certain
Asian countries. The trend for financial markets is to be better
controlled and regulated,'' he said, adding that Hong Kong's new
rules on short-selling stock merely mirror regulations in the
United States. ``Before, it was complete cowboy land here.''
</P>
<P>
   Policy debates exist not only between neighbors, but also within
countries. In Indonesia and South Korea, where new presidents have
tried to open markets and eliminate privileges, opposition from
entrenched business interests has made a consistent national policy
response impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Vvested interests and ideological differences have also
agreement on regional recovery plans elusive. A month ago, leaders
who gathered for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in
Kuala Lumpur failed to agree on a plan for reviving the region. And
though ASEAN is expected to announce a regional free trade zone by
2002, analysts say policies implemented by each country will
influence investors far more than collective promises.
</P>
<P>
   That is partly because ASEAN is seen by many as a toothless
tiger, allowing members to do as they like and fudge deadlines.
More importantly, agreement on what caused the crisis must come
before a regional blueprint for its solution.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Faber, managing director of his own investment firm here,
disagrees with those who say Asia will emerge from the crisis freer
and less feudal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the whole crisis will strengthen the old Asian system,
because it has created animosity to Western capitalism. Most
businessmen don't blame themselves for the crisis; they blame the
Western system or Western speculators,'' Faber said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Guarnieri says public opinion has been too harsh
on Asia. ``They expect Asian people and governments to take steps
that took the US and Europe decades,'' he said. ``We've got
economies who've built overcapacity in record time, and boom _ the
financial sector explodes and they have to reform. Give them time.
They've already implemented changes in record time.''

PROFESSORS WIN BATTLE WITH MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Microsoft Corp. has lost again in its First Amendment
legal battle with two Boston-area business professors.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge federal appeals court panel in Boston Tuesday
upheld a lower court ruling that denies Microsoft access to tapes
and research notes generated by the professors, who have written a
book about Microsoft's rival Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Professors David Yoffie of Harvard Business School and Michael
Cusumano of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology conducted
lengthy interviews with Netscape executives while writing
``Competing on Internet Time: Lessons from Netscape and Its Battle
with Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft believed that information in these notes could help
the company prepare its defense in an ongoing federal antitrust
case.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has accused Microsoft of using its
dominance in personal computer software to unfairly undermine
competitors including Netscape, which was once the leading maker of
Internet browsing software.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft attorneys hoped that the notes collected by Yoffie and
Cusumano would paint a different picture, and so the company tried
to subpoena their notes.
</P>
<P>
   But Yoffie and Cusumano contested the subpoena, arguing that
Microsoft's action posed a severe threat to academic freedom under
the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Yoffie and Cusumano warned that few prominent business
executives would give interviews to scholars if they feared that
the unedited interview notes could end up in court someday.
</P>
<P>
   In October, the federal district court agreed with the
professors, and Microsoft appealed.
</P>
<P>
   But the appellate court also sided with Yoffie and Cusumano.
While conceding that Microsoft had a legitimate interest in
obtaining the information, the court said that Microsoft was free
to subpoena the Netscape officials in order to get the information.
Forcing scholars to hand over their research notes ``would
hamstring not only the respondents' future research efforts, but
also those of other similarly situated scholars,'' the appellate
court ruled.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the court held that such an outcome would have a
chilling effect on the flow of information to the public, raising
serious First Amendment concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft spokesman Tom Pilla said the company has not yet
decided its next move, but continues to believe it is entitled to
the information in the Yoffie-Cusumano notes. ``We believe that the
Cusumano tapes, which contain candid interviews with Netscape
executives, represents evidence with a direct bearing on the
antitrust case brought by the government,'' Pilla said.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Albano, the attorney representing Yoffie, praised the
appeals court decision. ``To me the most significant thing about
the case is that the First Circuit Court of Appeals continues to
recognize that confidential sources, whether used by journalists or
by scholars, deserve protection,'' Albano said.

POP STANDARDS AND CABARET LOSING NEW YORK OUTLETS, LEAVING A
CULTURAL GAP
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In this town, birthplace of the Broadway musical, the
Brill Building, the Cotton Club, Carnegie Hall and the Copacabana,
the musical past and present continually refresh each other in a
way that happens nowhere else in the country. Nothing of musical
value ever really seems to die. That's why the thought of a New
York climate in which the voices of Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald,
Tony Bennett and a dozen others like them can't be heard regularly
on the radio is almost unimaginable.
</P>
<P>
   But after midnight on Dec. 27, when WQEW (1560 AM), the only New
York outlet for popular music predating rock, closes shop after six
years to become a Disney-operated children's station, those voices
will have almost completely vanished from the local airwaves. The
station, owned by The New York Times Co., , has been leased for
eight years to ABC Inc., a Disney subsidiary that will provide the
new programming.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, almost simultaneously with the format shift,
Rainbow and Stars, the city's leading cabaret, will close its doors
forever, as its lease and that of the adjoining Rainbow Room pass
into new hands.
</P>
<P>
   WQEW is not exactly a temple of enlightened nostalgia; but with
its passing, a vital link to our shared cultural past is being
severed. What will be absent from the airwaves is an ideal of
civility exemplified by popular singers conveying the deepest
personal emotions in intimate voices.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you might hear Sinatra's ``Strangers in the Night'' now and
then on an oldies station, but nowhere will you hear his music
explored with anything close to the depth and passion that WQEW's
resident Sinatra-phile, the disk jockey and author Jonathan
Schwartz, has brought to his weekly Saturday show devoted to the
singer.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there will be television specials celebrating vintage
American pop on PBS and biographies of pre-rock pop singers on the
A&AMP;E and E! networks. Sinatra will certainly not be forgotten in New
York or anywhere else, and Bennett will keep making records.
</P>
<P>
   But no longer will there be a place you can tune into any time
and find the world of Sinatra, Fitzgerald and the big bands, of
Rodgers and Hart, Cole Porter, Duke Ellington and the Gershwins.
This is the music Schwartz, the station's resident pundit, has
called ``American classical music,'' even if the station dilutes it
with kitsch.
</P>
<P>
   The closing of Rainbow and Stars is a stunning and unfortunate
coincidence. The club, on the 65th floor of the General Electric
building in Rockefeller Center, brought a touch of old-time
nightclub glamour to midtown. Since opening with a solo engagement
by Bennett in 1989, traditional pop singers like Rosemary Clooney
(who played there almost every year), Vic Damone and Margaret
Whiting have appeared there, as have worthy successors like Maureen
McGovern, Susannah McCorkle, Karen Akers, Mary Cleere Haran, Amanda
McBroom, Ann Hampton Callaway, Michael Feinstein and David
Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   The club also presented quite a few revues (of wildly uneven
quality) surveying the contributions of pre-rock American composers
from Irving Berlin to the Gershwins to Leonard Bernstein. I'll
never forget a brilliant Rodgers and Hart show in which Elaine
Stritch, drawling in her parched whisky voice, delivered
show-stopping performances of ``10 Cents a Dance'' and ``Zip'' that
turned these gems into sustained, profoundly witty wisecracks.
</P>
<P>
   During the six years they were operating at the same time, WQEW
and Rainbow and Stars cultivated a policy of mutual cooperation.
Artists who were appearing at the club were regularly interviewed
on WQEW, and this synergy benefited everyone. Devotees of
traditional pop could discern a continuity between older and
younger generations of performers, and a genuine if tenuous sense
of a traditional pop music community was established.
</P>
<P>
   As much as the station and the club will be missed, however, it
would be foolish to pretend that their simultaneous disappearance
will mean that paradise has been lost. Both institutions had to
operate in the tough real world of television-dominated media,
driven by ratings and box office. For all its commitment to
tradition, WQEW (with the exception of Schwartz's 25 hours a week
on the air) generally took the low and easy road in its
programming.
</P>
<P>
   Rainbow and Stars, which had to struggle merely to break even,
lost money on many of its best shows. Like other cabarets in New
York, it found that the pool of significant younger talent and the
audience to support it were not large enough to guarantee financial
success.
</P>
<P>
   And high-end cabaret is very pricey. The biggest draws were
often television personalities with marginal musical talents like
Kathie Lee Gifford, Tony Danza and Cybill Shepherd who dipped into
cabaret as a lark.
</P>
<P>
   Television values also dictated which performers would get
invaluable free publicity on morning talk shows, with youth and
good looks often chosen over experience and artistic depth. But in
general, television bookers shunned the entire field of cabaret as
old hat. Even Rosie O'Donnell, the Broadway musical's most vocal
cheerleader on television, has rarely deigned to explore a cabaret
world that is to some degree an offshoot of Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   In its programming, WQEW played it safe by acting most of the
time like a Top 40 radio station. Instead of insisting on quality,
it relied on the pop charts of the 1940s and '50s. Even the most
cursory glance at the hit parades of four, five and six decades ago
finds them clogged with silly novelties and saccharine ballads. At
the same time, many of the pop songs we now call standards never
hit the upper reaches of the charts in their day.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Perry Como and Patti Page, two of WQEW's most-played artists,
are certainly capable singers. But the roster of their hits amounts
to a dreary junk heap of disposable pop trinkets: Como's ``Hot
Diggity (Dog Ziggity Boom),'' ``Papa Loves Mambo,'' ``Wanted,''
``Round and Round'' and ``Catch a Falling Star,'' and Ms. Page's
``I Went to Your Wedding,'' ``Mr. and Mississippi,'' ``Changing
Partners,'' and ``Cross Over the Bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   Although these trite ditties exert a certain nostalgic appeal,
as a steady musical diet they are about as tasty and edifying as
Wonder Bread served every day at breakfast, lunch and dinner.
</P>
<P>
   That diet has also included heavy doses of vocal groups like the
Four Aces, the Ames Brothers, the Four Lads and the McGuire
Sisters. Their vapid '50s hits remind you of why the rock-and-roll
upsurge was inevitable. When WQEW ventured into the '60s and '70s,
its taste veered toward the smarmiest pop by Barry Manilow, Helen
Reddy, Neil Diamond and Engelbert Humperdinck.
</P>
<P>
   With the notable exception of Schwartz, WQEW's reliance on
formula extended to its disk jockeys, who were little more than
announcers identifying the tunes they were given to play. When all
is said and done, Schwartz's vision of American classical music
remained sadly unrealized on his very own station.
</P>
<P>
   Already a search for a new radio outlet for traditional pop is
under way. The ideal solution would be the vintage pop and jazz
equivalent of a free-form FM rock station of the late 1960s and
early '70s. But would the public that supports traditional pop
music tune into a station that didn't concentrate on the hits? My
guess is that it would.
</P>
<P>
   The demise of WQEW and Rainbow and Stars hardly means that it's
all over for traditional pop in New York. The cabaret scene
flourishes at Cafe Carlyle, the Oak Room of the Algonquin Hotel,
the Firebird Cafe, Eighty-Eight's and other clubs. Tuesday night a
brand new mid-level Manhattan club, the Garrick Gaieties, opened in
the Mayfair Hotel (242 W. 49th St.), with Claiborne Cary and
Phillip Officer. City Center's Encores series of Broadway musical
revivals in concert is a huge success. The 92nd St. Y's Lyrics and
Lyricists series rolls on even after the death of its artistic
director, Maurice Levine. And the Mabel Mercer Foundation's annual
cabaret convention at Town Hall, a kind of clearing house of talent
from around the country, has become an October perennial, despite
the unwieldy length of its events and the amateurish quality of
many performances.
</P>
<P>
   In early February, Lincoln Center will unveil its American
Songbook series, the pop music equivalent of Classical Jazz, which
later evolved into Jazz at Lincoln Center. When tickets went on
sale for the first four shows of the American Songbook in February
and March at Alice Tully Hall, they were sold out in a matter of
hours.
</P>
<P>
   The roster of singers for the first program, devoted to the life
and music of Harold Arlen, is a potent mixture of Broadway and
cabaret talent. Schwartz, the series' artistic director and host,
will bring to the stage the same mixture of erudition and
enthusiasm that have earned him a loyal following (and some
detractors who dislike his tendency toward pomposity). But the
instant demand for the American Songbook series suggests that the
market for traditional pop is larger and hungrier than many like to
imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Here are two New Year's wishes, neither of which seems an
impossible dream.
</P>
<P>
   The first is for the establishment of a new traditional pop
station that is not so hit-oriented. Instead of Ms. Clooney's
novelty hits ``Botch-a-Me'' and ``Come On-a My House,'' you'd be
able to hear her little known masterpieces like her album ``Love,''
recorded with Nelson Riddle. Instead of the incessant repetition of
Bennett's ``Rags to Riches,'' you would get generous helpings from
his two brilliant duet albums with pianist Bill Evans. There would
be a lot more Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, and Sarah Vaughan
(not singing her trite ``Broken-Hearted Melody'' but the Gershwin
songbook). Alongside Glenn Miller and Artie Shaw, you would hear a
lot of Count Basie, Claude Thornhill and Miles Davis. And
absolutely no Guy Mitchell, ever.
</P>
<P>
   The other is for the return of a top-of-the-line cabaret of
Rainbow and Stars' caliber that would combine the best of the old
while bringing jazzier artists into its fold. Musical quality, not
television, would determine the booking policy. And New York would
finally have the supreme nightclub it deserves.

COMMENTARY: MONICAGATE YEAR TWO
</HEADLINE>
  (editors: in Supreme Court quote (3rd graf), replace parentheses
with brackets. Also: boldfaced words should be italicized.) 
 (bl) 
By FRANK RICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are only 29 more shopping days until Jan. 21 _ the
first-year anniversary of Monicagate. The only thing certain about
Year Two is that anyone who prognosticates about it with certainty
has no clue.
</P>
<P>
   This hasn't stopped the predictions. Time and Newsweek
journalists have forecast the exact count of the House impeachment
vote on TV. James Glassman, the syndicated financial columnist, has
declared that a Senate trial ``won't damage either stocks or the
real economy.'' (Phew!) Alan Simpson, the GOP senator turned
Harvard professor, says that his party need not worry about any
political fallout because ``the attention span of Americans is,
`Which movie is coming out next month?'''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, these certainties have to be set against the record of
those that came before. Wasn't Bill Clinton going to be out of
office in January, or after the Starr report, or the inquisition
video, or _ whatever? Virtually every known expert, regardless of
ideology, predicted a pickup of congressional seats by the GOP in
November, and when that proved wrong, the same seers predicted that
the Democrats' strong showing meant that impeachment was ``over''
(in the word of George Stephanopoulos). For its part, the Supreme
Court had certified that the Paula Jones trial was ``highly
unlikely to occupy any substantial amount of (the president's)
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet no one foresaw the demise of Newt Gingrich or (Vogue
excepted) the rise of Hillary Clinton. And whatever happened to the
``talking points,'' to Kenneth Starr's reports on Whitewater and
Filegate, to Clinton's on-camera temper tantrum before the grand
jury, to a negotiated censure deal, and to the widespread
conviction that even if the Judiciary Committee voted articles of
impeachment, they would fail on the floor of the full House?
</P>
<P>
   In this context, believe Washington's current truisms at your
peril: that an explicit presidential confession to ``lying'' will
sway a crucial number of GOP moderates in a party run by its right
wing; that a last-minute plea bargain or parliamentary maneuver
will prevent a Senate trial; or that a trial might be brief. In the
past week alone, Orrin Hatch has publicly predicted both that it
``could tie up the Senate for a year or more'' and will reach ``a
quick end.'' Who knows? Since a simple majority of senators can
reverse any ruling by the presiding judge, the chief justice,
precedent means little. Besides, in Andrew Johnson's day, there
wasn't TV with its bounteous opportunities for grandstanding by
lawyers and politicians alike.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back on Monicagate Year One, one can see only two fixed
points, both consistently underrated by the fortune-tellers:
Clinton's superhuman resilience, which keeps him clinging to office
no matter what, and the equal tenacity of his opponents, who won't
stop trying to bring him down no matter what the polls. Their
battle, in which the American middle is held hostage, is a holy war
that not only dates back to Clinton's first victory but to the
Vietnam era. In the lines drawn by The Wall Street Journal, which
has published four thick books of anti-Clinton screeds since '92,
the goal is that Starr, ``a hymn-singing son of a fundamentalist
minister,'' succeed in ``prosecuting the entire culture that gave
birth to what Bill Clinton represents.''
</P>
<P>
   The weirdly prurient Starr, of course, no more represents all
Christians or conservatives than the duplicitous, unprincipled
Clinton represents the sexual or moral ethos of ``the '60s
generation'': they are both caricatures of their constituencies,
elevated to symbolic archetypes by the year's polarizing events.
</P>
<P>
   But both these antagonists are now merely footnotes to the
bitter culture war they've helped re-ignite.
</P>
<P>
   That is why this week's falsest prediction is that the Senate
would return to the country's ``real business'' were there no
impeachment trial.  &UR; Hello? &LR;  As we enter Monicagate Year Two, isn't
it past time to concede that the war it so garishly represents  &UR; is
 &LR;  the real business of the country? A Congress paralyzed by the
ideological strife of partisans on both sides did nothing about
Social Security, HMOs, campaign finance reform, taxes or much else
during Year One either. Neither it nor we may ever get back to that
business unless the unfinished business festering for 30 years is
settled first.

JONBENET RAMSEY CASE MOVES AT `INCREDIBLY SLOW' PACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Ga.)  (mk) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOULDER, Colo. _ Nearly two years after JonBenet Ramsey was
murdered in her home here on Christmas night, a grand jury
investigation moves at a pace that many outsiders call leisurely.
</P>
<P>
   The second anniversary of the strangulation death of the beauty
princess will find the 12 grand jurors on a five-week Christmas
break. This comes after the jurors took one week off for
Thanksgiving. During a 10-week stretch this fall, the panel met
only 18 times to investigate the case, a murder mystery that has
fascinated the nation and much of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty amazing that they are taking a full month off, it
seems more like a vacation than an investigation,'' said Craig
Silverman, a Denver trial lawyer who is not involved in the case.
``They are still moving at this incredibly slow, Boulder pace. It
is amazing the lack of urgency.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 15, six months after the grand jury was impaneled for a
one-year term, District Attorney Alexander Hunter of Boulder County
took the case before the grand jury. If the grand jurors
investigate the case into the spring, as expected, their term will
be extended for an additional six months.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, the jurors heard testimony from a series of
law-enforcement witnesses _ Boulder police detectives and officers
and a state handwriting analyst. They also toured the Tudor-style
house here where the Ramseys lived until JonBenet's death.
</P>
<P>
   After the jurors reconvene in January, they are expected to hear
from neighbors and employees of the Ramseys in Boulder, as well as
many members of the Ramsey family, including the 6-year-old girl's
parents, John and Patsy Ramsey. In the summer of 1997, they sold
their house here and moved to an Atlanta suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter took the JonBenet case to the grand jury shortly after a
former Boulder police detective on the case and three former
friends of the Ramseys publicly demanded that Colorado's governor,
Roy Romer, replace Hunter on the case with a special prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Bill Owens, Colorado's governor-elect, said he would
resist calls for a special prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a special prosecutor would have been necessary, had
the grand jury not been called,'' Owens, a Republican, said. ``At
this point, I am willing to await the results of the grand jury.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of prosecutors here said that they had little experience
investigating and trying homicides in Boulder, a college city that
has about one murder a year. Indeed, in an unrelated case, Hunter's
office on Friday won its first murder conviction here since 1992.
To push the Ramsey case along, prosecutors from neighboring
counties have lent to Hunter's office prosecutors with experience
in homicides and grand juries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alex has gotten what many people feel he didn't have _
extremely competent grand jury prosecutors, prosecutors with a
great depth of homicide experience,'' Bob Grant, district attorney
for Adams County, said Tuesday. Noting that he had lent his chief
trial deputy, Bruce Levin, to the case, Grant added, ``There really
isn't any way to predict how long an investigative grand jury will
go on.''
</P>
<P>
   As the grand jury has proved leak proof and as the murder case
has grown cold, interest among news organizations has tapered off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starting in January 1997, at least one of the tabloids had
JonBenet on their cover for 55 straight weeks,'' said Stan Oliner,
manuscripts curator for the Colorado Historical Society. Noting a
dwindling flow for the society's JonBenet Ramsey Manuscript
Collection, he added: ``It has become an occasional story. The
Lewinsky story has replaced the pounding, week after week, coverage
of JonBenet.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, last week's headlines seemed to speak of a case frozen
in time.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday evening, Ramsey attacked a free-lance photographer
who tried to take his picture on a Boulder sidewalk, the
photographer, Frank Coffman, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He charged right at me and grabbed hold of me with both hands
and tried to throw me around a bit,'' Coffman said in an interview.
Coffman said he did not intend to file charges.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Bynum, a lawyer and business partner of Ramsey who
witnessed the encounter, did not return telephone calls Tuesday.
Another business partner of Ramsey, Jay Elowsky, pleaded guilty
earlier this year to misdemeanor assault charge after he brandished
a baseball bat at two men he thought were newspaper reporters.
</P>
<P>
   A Denver newspaper also headlined last week: ``Ramsey Family DNA
Sought.'' Five members of the Ramseys' extended family agreed to
give Boulder police palm prints and DNA samples last week.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the ongoing investigation, detectives reportedly are
trying to identify a mystery palm print found in the Ramsey
basement and stray bits of DNA found under the little girl's
fingernails. Knowing that unidentified DNA could bolster the theory
that his daughter was murdered by a mysterious intruder, Ramsey
wrote in a public letter Sept. 28: ``We have been told that the
authorities have your DNA. They will know it is you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the DNA is not identified, it does weaken the prosecution's
case,'' said Scott Robinson, a Denver defense lawyer who follows
the case for several Denver news outlets. JonBenet's parents have
already provided police with DNA samples, largely snippets of hair.
The five family members who were scheduled to provide samples last
week all have alibis placing them far from Boulder on the night of
the murder.

A `NOT NEW YORK' SHOP SWITCHES TACTICS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Minn., Ore., Pa.)  (rl) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One of America's most creative agencies is hoping
that the coming-out party for its New York office will be a beer
blast.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is Wieden &AMP; Kennedy, which is seeking to raise the
profiles of the larger offices beyond its headquarters in Portland,
Ore. As part of those ambitious efforts, the agency's New York
office has been assigned an important task: leading the pitch for
the creative portion of the Miller Lite beer account, with billings
estimated at $150 million, in a review now being conducted by the
Miller Brewing Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason for that is to give us a clean look at that
challenge,'' said Dan Wieden, president of Wieden &AMP; Kennedy, in a
telephone interview from his office in Portland. ``And it's a
pretty intense challenge.'' The Wieden creative presentation is
scheduled for Friday; a decision is expected in January.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's increased attention to New York is intriguing
because it was a pioneer in the decentralization trend of the 1980s
that significantly reduced New York's hegemony in the advertising
world.
</P>
<P>
   Powerful advertising centers emerged in cities like Portland,
Minneapolis and San Francisco, where Wieden and other shops
including Fallon McElligott and the Goodby, Silverstein &AMP; Partners
unit of Omnicom Group competed against _ and often beat _ the
longtime giants of Madison Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   From its main office, Wieden poured out high-energy,
high-profile campaigns for marketers like Nike, Microsoft, ESPN and
Coca-Cola. Even when the agency made an earlier foray onto the East
Coast, to handle the Subaru of America account, the office was in
Philadelphia, not New York.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the Wieden &AMP; Kennedy bandwagon encounters speed bumps,
particularly in its relationship with Nike, the agency is pressing
to expand by landing new business at its other major offices, which
include Amsterdam, London and Tokyo in addition to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether it was contradictory for an agency that was a
primary force in the ``not New York'' movement to begin promoting
its presence there, Wieden replied, laughing: ``I remember all my
old speeches about `the belly of the beast.' It's hard to eat my
own words and save some sense of dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because the industry is decentralized doesn't mean New
York is no longer a player,'' Wieden said. ``New York is a huge
player.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to wrestle with this business,'' he added,
``you might as well wrestle where the main stage is.''
</P>
<P>
   The top managers of the New York office, all longtime employees
of the agency, agreed with Wieden's assessment in an interview last
week at their office on lower Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking the Amtrak into New York from Philadelphia, we always
felt we were going into the nerve center of advertising,'' said
Stacy Wall, 31, co-creative director.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it wasn't a question of `Now we have to tackle New
York,''' he added, ``because the work we were doing was already
tackling the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Wall said, ``as the years have gone by, we've gained a
certain amount of confidence in our abilities'' to vie for
assignments in the overcrowded New York market.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he added with a smile, ``it's nice to use Wieden &AMP;
Kennedy experience to help build Wieden &AMP; Kennedy, because a lot of
other people here in New York and elsewhere are using Wieden &AMP;
Kennedy experience to build other agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   The office opened in April 1995 to buy commercial time for Nike
and Microsoft. Two years later, it was upgraded to a full-service
office with the transfer of the ESPN account from Portland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't have some clients if we didn't have a presence in
New York,'' said Tom Winner, 52, broadcast media director, who
described himself as ``employee one'' there.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the New York office handled creative assignments with
billings estimated at $30 million out of an agency total of $875
million. This year, the figure has increased to about $50 million
of $835 million, lower because of cutbacks by Nike. There are 30
employees in New York and 257 in Portland; the worldwide total is
457.
</P>
<P>
   The work from New York for ESPN, a unit of the Walt Disney Co.,
includes the hugely popular campaign for ``Sports Center,'' offbeat
ads for the new ESPN Magazine and a campaign for the network's
coverage of the Women's National Basketball Association that
features a band paying homage to 1970s funk music.
</P>
<P>
   Other accounts include Suretrade Inc., an online brokerage
service, and the CK One fragrance marketed by Unilever and Calvin
Klein; that campaign, in collaboration with CRK Advertising,
Klein's in-house agency, is centered on tales told through e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, it would be great to have Miller Lite at Wieden &AMP;
Kennedy,'' said Tom Blessington, 36, managing director of the New
York office. ``It's fair to say the agency has rededicated itself
to new business, which was something we were not actively seeking
in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   And ``it has taken us some time to assemble the team,'' he
added, such as the recent hiring of Lisa Welch-Nehring, 29, as
strategic planning director, from the TBWA/Chiat/Day unit of
Omnicom.
</P>
<P>
   Wieden has been an agency for Miller, owned by the Philip Morris
Cos., since late 1996, handling the creative duties for the Miller
Genuine Draft and Miller High Life beer brands from Portland.
Miller Lite, the best-selling Miller brand, has been at Fallon
McElligott during that same time; that agency is also taking part
in the review, as are three other shops.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to have the New York office take part in the Miller
Lite review serves two purposes, Blessington said: to focus
attention on the office and to reassure Miller executives that
Portland employees ``managing the other two brands will not take
their eye off the ball to pursue Lite.'' The Portland office is
working on revamping ads for Miller Genuine Draft.
</P>
<P>
   Wall and Michael Prieve, 35, the other co-creative director,
declined to discuss specific aspects of their pitch for Miller
Lite. The review comes after critics castigated the brand's ads as
too unconventional and too narrowly focused on men in their 20s.
</P>
<P>
   Wall compared the agency's ideas to the ideas behind ``the work
we do for ESPN, which is really smart but really inclusive, across
a range of demographics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to return Miller Lite to being the brand of Sunday
afternoon football,'' he added, ``to get America laughing again.''
</P>
<P>
   Will Wieden be able to thrive in New York, where the intensity
of competition is no laughing matter?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hard market,'' Wieden said. ``I'll tell you that. It
doesn't take kindly to outsiders, especially to those who have
mouthed off a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But we have a lot of work to do,'' he added, ``and New York is
clearly critical to us.''

GEENA DAVID IS ACK. WEAKLINGS STEP ASIDE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 20) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A lively debate over what might have seemed an
innocuous line of dialogue broke out one day on the set of ``Stuart
Little,'' a movie based on E.B. White's classic 1945 children's
book about a family whose new son turns out to be a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   A throwback to this gentler era, the Little family is ``from the
polite planet,'' explained Hugh Laurie, the British actor who plays
the man of the house. And so in one scene, as his devoted wife
hovers over the washing machine, Little observes, ``Dear, you look
beautiful when you're doing the laundry.'' That was when the
trouble started.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Little, as it turns out, is being portrayed by Geena Davis,
an actress known less for her way with ring-around-the-collar than
for man-stomping roles in films like ``Thelma and Louise'' and
``The Long Kiss Goodnight.'' Indeed, Ms. Davis, has insisted
throughout her roller-coaster career that her characters be strong,
unconventional and independent _ not the type, in other words, who
do a lot of laundry and, if they do, sit still when told it makes
them look attractive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The line will not be in the movie,'' Rob Minkoff, the movie's
director, said tersely of the outcome of the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   The Academy Award-winning actress Geena Davis is back, or at
least working at a comeback after a two-year hiatus and a divorce.
And she has made it clear that she is willing to play just about
anything _ except a weakling. The scene in her new movie symbolizes
the critical juncture where Ms. Davis, who is 41, stands.
</P>
<P>
   This will not be an easy venture. For one, although she is tall
and striking, her age precludes her from playing the sort of sexy
roles reserved for younger women _ putting her in a category that
includes many other talented actresses, from Meg Ryan and Susan
Sarandon to Meryl Streep.
</P>
<P>
   Further, she is struggling to make herself into a star who can
open a major picture, both in action roles and as a comedic or
dramatic actress. Actors like Mel Gibson, Bruce Willis and Harrison
Ford, for instance, bounce back and forth between such roles, but
very few actresses _ Sigourney Weaver and Demi Moore come to mind _
have been able to take on such diverse parts and succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big action movies are geared mostly to teen-aged boys, and
very few actresses in their late 30s or early 40s can turn on that
audience,'' said Lynda Obst, a producer of films like ``The Fisher
King'' and ``Sleepless in Seattle.'' ``I'm just hoping that the
whole culture is turning French. Maybe the idea of a really sexy
41-year-old woman won't be so alien in the movies. There are a lot
of really good actresses coming into that age, and I think this may
be a transitional time. But they have to make smart choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Davis concedes that her own choices in the past few years
have not worked out, and it has been an unusually long two years
since Ms. Davis has even made a picture _ a time she said she
needed for reflection after a difficult divorce from the Finnish
action-film director Renny Harlin, her third husband.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Davis had built her reputation on quirky, comic parts like
the love-struck dog trainer Muriel Pritchett in ``The Accidental
Tourist'' (1988), for which she won her Oscar as best supporting
actress. But after marrying Harlin in 1993, she veered in another
direction and tried to carry several big-budget action films that
failed. Harlin directed her in ``Cutthroat Island,'' an extravagant
pirate drama, and ``The Long Kiss Goodnight,'' in which she played
a government assassin on the lam.
</P>
<P>
   Now she is single again, and she said that while she was willing
to go back to comedy and quirkiness, she would not relinquish her
hard-won strength. Ms. Davis reportedly took a big cut in her fee,
to something in the neighborhood of $1 million, to star as a mother
committed to her darling son, Stuart (the voice of Michael J. Fox),
who happens to be smart, adventurous, debonair _ and a rodent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that I have to be a hero, but definitely interesting
and determining my own fate,'' insisted Ms. Davis, who is both
athletic and intelligent, pointing out that she's a member of
Mensa, a society for those with high IQs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, (italics)I'd(end italics) want to be the fly,'' she
added, referring to her role as Jeff Goldblum's girlfriend in the
1986 remake of ``The Fly.'' ``I want to play baseball. I don't want
to play the baseball player's wife. Of course, she DID play
basebell, in `a league of their own,' right? ``I want to be the one
having an arc, who's changing, having the experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Davis is not the only actress, of course, who has expressed
such aims. The challenge has always been fulfilling them in
Hollywood, where sex-role stereotypes die hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Geena's been unfailingly positive and made Mrs. Little a
little unusual maybe, but caring,'' said Minkoff, who previously
directed Disney's animated ``Lion King.'' ``She has strong views.
She isn't asking that this become a girl's movie. She would like it
to be at least a girl-friendly movie.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been a decade since Ms. Davis went for loopy characters
like the dizzy manicurist in ``Earth Girls Are Easy'' (1989).
Increasingly, she had been trying to do movies that made a point,
motivated by the unexpected success in 1991 of ``Thelma and
Louise,'' a Ridley Scott film with startling role reversals.
</P>
<P>
   In that almost elegiac road movie, Ms. Davis and Susan Sarandon
follow a path of violence and destruction that was once the
exclusive domain of brash and reckless male characters. And the
following year there was the success of ``A League of Their Own,''
about a women's baseball team, in which Ms. Davis played Dottie
Hinson, a ``Gary Cooper type character,'' as she put it.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Thelma and Louise' had a tremendous impact on me as a
person,'' Ms. Davis said. ``It was so different to have people come
up to me and say, `You changed my life.' I thought, `This is really
cool.' And to follow that up with `League of Their Own,' that was
like a double whammy. It definitely colored what followed after
that.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be in movies where I do something cool, not where
I'm super virtuous, but where I make my own decisions. After
`Thelma and Louise,' I took on more responsibility for what I was
doing and a desire to choose parts where women could feel free to
identify with my character.''
</P>
<P>
   There was more to it, though. Ms. Davis, and her co-star from
that film, Ms. Sarandon, also emphasized that action parts were
appealing because they tended to pay better. ``Let's be honest, you
do an action film to get your price up,'' said Ms. Sarandon, a
thought that Ms. Davis seconded.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sarandon said that she, too, had been stunned by the debate
provoked by ``Thelma and Louise's'' hellbent characters but that
she had taken away from it a different lesson than Ms. Davis had.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an actor you're trying to develop as many new muscles as
you can, both figuratively and literally, and do different kinds of
parts,'' she said. ``But action is tricky. I don't want to be a
strong woman who imitates the worst sides of male strength. I was
really concerned about falling into the trap of that thing of
violence equals power equals no responsibility for your actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ms. Sarandon never tried another part like Louise in
``Thelma and Louise.'' She took on roles of quieter bravado, like
the mother struggling to find a cure for her sick child in
``Lorenzo's Oil,'' the valiant and beloved Marmee in ``Little
Women,'' and a brave nun counseling a death-row inmate in ``Dead
Man Walking,'' for which she won an Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Davis went on to marry Harlin and consciously pursued parts
that seemed, if not role models, then parts in which the women
stood for (italics)something.(end italics) But things did not go as
planned.
</P>
<P>
   The last time audiences saw her was in the 1996 film ``The Long
Kiss Goodnight,'' when she acted out a sort of feminist fantasy
gone berserk. After recovering a lost memory, her character is
transformed from Samantha Caine, a model mother with a busy baking
schedule, into Charly Baltimore, a brutal assassin who throttles
and shoots to death an assortment of antagonists _ even a deer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, who knows for sure why a film doesn't work?'' said
Joel Michaels, a producer of the disastrous ``Cutthroat Island.''
``One can only conjecture, but I think the audience didn't want to
see a woman in a role that has traditionally been held by a man.
What woman in the annals of film has been a consistent action
star?''
</P>
<P>
   But now it is as if the tape of her last movie has been rewound.
These days Ms. Davis looks a lot like Samantha Caine again. Not an
Uzi in sight, she is a perfect mother, deep in honeyed domesticity.
``Stuart Little,'' which will cost more than $80 million because of
the computerized animation that will be required to create the
urbane Stuart, is expected to be a major Christmas release next
year for Columbia Pictures.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent day on the set here, Ms. Davis, as Mrs. Little, wore
a very un-Charly-like teal twin set with maroon checked trousers
and sensible brown loafers. Her glasses hung from a chain around
her long neck and a barrette held back her shoulder-length auburn
hair.
</P>
<P>
   She was philosophical about where she had been, but unrelenting
in her insistence that she would not play the sort of female roles
that, as she frequently put it, were embarrassing to other women
because they were so deferential.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't go back and second-guess my choices,'' said Ms. Davis
of her foray into action films. ``It's all about making endless
choices, large and small. You have to keep moving on. The only
thing I had planned for my next parts was definitely not doing
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word I would extract from my thinking over the past two
years is `back.' I want to go back.''
</P>
<P>
   And so on a set where the cast and crew members play with yo-yos
in their down time, Ms. Davis practices archery. And going ``back''
means playing the ingenuous, proud Mrs. Little, a worrier and a
solver of problems for her unusual son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like this character,'' said Ms. Davis. ``She's really
centered and calmly solid as a mate and as a mother. They give
Stuart a wonderful sense of belonging and security.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the movie's message, beyond delivering a sense of fun and
comedy, Ms. Davis said she believes it embraces a powerful thought:
``I think it's a metaphor for prejudice,'' Ms. Davis said of how
the Littles, and the world outside, respond to a child who is a
mouse.
</P>
<P>
   The question will be what audiences make of Ms. Davis' return.
``Making movies is business and the people who make decisions like
to buy a product that has already proven successful, and so do the
audiences,'' said Ms. Sarandon. ``It's really hard to switch gears,
although I admire Geena for trying.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The vote on impeachment in the House of
Representatives this week could turn in part on a ruling on an
arcane point by the scrupulously impartial parliamentarian, Charles
W. Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 59, a lawyer who has worked in the parliamentarian's
office his entire professional life, was appointed to the top
position in 1994 when Democrats still controlled Congress. He is
only the third person to hold the job in the last 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   What the public will see on television at the end of the
impeachment debate will look spontaneous, but it will have been
carefully scripted.
</P>
<P>
   A Democrat, probably Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the
minority leader, will get recognized and offer a motion to send the
impeachment measure back to the Judiciary Committee with
instructions to the committee to produce a resolution of censure,
not impeachment. This is called a motion to recommit with
instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats believe they will have the best chance to defeat the
impeachment resolution if wavering lawmakers have the alternative
of voting to censure President Clinton. But the House Judiciary
Committee rejected a censure proposal last week.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders have the authority to bring up the
impeachment resolution in a way that would permit a direct vote on
censure. But they have declined to do so because they fear it could
drain crucial votes from the impeachment side.
</P>
<P>
   After the motion to recommit is offered, a Republican will make
a point of order that the motion is, in parliamentary language, not
germane to the impeachment resolution. Clause 7 of House Rule XVI,
written in 1789, states that ``no motion or proposition on a
subject different from that under consideration shall be
admitted.''
</P>
<P>
   This is where Charlie Johnson comes in. A tall, round-faced man
with short gray hair, Johnson will advise the presiding officer,
Rep. Ray LaHood, R-Ill., on how to rule on the motion. LaHood, as
presiding officers always do, will take Johnson's advice.
</P>
<P>
   No one involved will be surprised by the ruling. Democrats were
still working Tuesday night on the wording of their recommittal
motion. They have been consulting with Johnson extensively about
what would be germane and what would not.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson will know in advance what the Democratic motion will
say. When LaHood rules, he will read a statement that Johnson will
have written ahead of time. Democrats may disagree with the ruling.
But in a House riven by partisan discord, it is safe to bet that no
one will attribute the ruling to partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief interview Tuesday, Johnson would not say how he might
rule. He is the archetype of a civil servant who shuns the
spotlight and would not allow himself to be photographed for this
article. When he registered to vote in his hometown, Bethesda, Md.,
he declined to state his party affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson joined the parliamentarian's office in 1964 right out of
the University of Virginia Law School. He said today that he wanted
``nonpartisan legal work in Congress.'' He rose to deputy
parliamentarian in 1974 and was appointed parliamentarian in
September 1994, when Democrats still controlled the House.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, he was reappointed by Speaker Newt Gingrich in 1995
and again in 1997. By custom, the position of parliamentarian does
not change hands when party control of the House changes. Johnson's
predecessor, William H. Brown, served from 1974 until he retired in
1994. Lewis Deschler was the parliamentarian from 1928 until 1974.
</P>
<P>
   The expectation in the House is that Johnson will not allow a
recommittal motion that uses the word ``censure'' because it is not
directly pertinent to impeachment. But students of parliamentary
procedure say he almost certainly will allow a motion stating that
impeachment is not warranted. The question is whether the Democrats
can find something in between that would swing undecided votes.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling on germaneness would not be final. It could be
appealed by the Democrats and overturned by a majority vote of the
House. And if a motion involving censure is termed nongermane,
Democrats will probably make such an appeal and pose it as a chance
to vote for censure.
</P>
<P>
   But the prospects for success are poor. In the last 60 years,
Johnson said, the chair's ruling has been reversed only four times,
never on a matter of national importance.
</P>
<P>
   It is easier to find votes for the impeachment of the president
than it is to overrule the parliamentarian.

TRIAL OF LOCKERBIE SUSPECTS A STEP CLOSER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Days before the 10th anniversary of the bombing of
a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, Libya's legislative body has
taken a step toward allowing two suspects to be put on trial in a
neutral country.
</P>
<P>
   Libya's General People's Congress has approved of a request by
the United States and Britain to hold a trial in the Netherlands,
according to a Libyan TV broadcast Tuesday. The legislators also
called on Libya, Britain, and the United States to ``remove any
obstacle'' blocking the start of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the US government and the United Nations said the
reports were a good sign, but academics who specialize in
international law said the trial in the Netherlands raises tricky
legal questions. Once such international prosecutions in third
countries begin, US officials and agents involved in covert actions
might face similar proceedings, said Al Rubin, a professor of
international law at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at
Tufts University.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole thing is very weird,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Under a plan that UN Secretary General Kofi Annan presented 10
days ago in a visit to Libya, the country's leader, Moammar
Khadafy, must surrender the two suspects for a trial. The United
Nations has kept an air and arms embargo on Libya, and has frozen
the country's assets abroad over the Dec. 21, 1988, bombing, which
many US officials say Khadafy masterminded.
</P>
<P>
   Years of wrangling, negotiations, and accusations have failed to
solve the crime, which killed 270 people, including 23 from New
England. Relatives of the victims are angry and US officials warn
that those behind the bombing must be convicted and imprisoned if
potential terrorists are to be deterred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice has been delayed for almost 10 years . . . It is time
for Libya to meet its obligations,'' said a White House spokesman,
P. J. Crowley.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations, a senior official expressed hope tinged
by skepticism that the trial of the two men is imminent. ``We'll
believe it when we see them on the airplane'' coming to the
Netherlands, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sketchy news from Libya left Khadafy room Tuesday to maneuver
and backtrack. The General People's Congress, composed of about 500
representatives from lower level assemblies, is controlled by
Khadafy but he has not publicly endorsed the decision. And the
announcement did not answer logistical questions, such as how Libya
would deliver the two suspects, who are believed to be government
agents.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, detectives tracked a suitcase with a bomb on the plane
to two men, Abdul Basset Ali Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah. US
officials indicted them. Their lawyer, Frank Rubino, says they are
innocent. Libya has refused to deport them.
</P>
<P>
   If the suspects are sent to trial, ``it is a major development,
clearly a victory for international adjudication and the
possibility of the victims' families getting some sense of
justice,'' said Christopher C. Joyner, a professor of international
law at Georgetown University. Also, he said, any capitulation by
Khadafy would be a sign that sanctions are squeezing Libya.
</P>
<P>
   But Joyner, too, voiced doubts. ``The major question that is
unanswered: Why would Khadafy want to go forward with the trial,
allow these two individuals to speak out in public and perhaps
implicate him?''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin and other specialists say it will be difficult to set the
rules for a trial for a crime that allegedly was committed by
Libyans in international air space, involving an American airliner
that took off from British soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are going to be the judges?'' asked Rubin, the Tufts
professor, who has served as chairman of a terrorism committee of
the 130-year-old International Law Association. ``Does the Scottish
law apply in the case? How are these two guys supposed to get to
Netherlands, and what happens to them if they are convicted?''
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, the men would be tried under Scottish law
and serve time in Britain if convicted. But Libya's foreign affairs
minister, Omar Mustapha al-Montasser, has said that his country
wanted the two suspects to be jailed in Libya if found guilty.

PALESTINIANS CALL FIRST FAMILY'S VISIT `GOOD FOR US'

   BETHLEHEM, West Bank _ Down crumbling alleyways so narrow a car
can't pass through, electric banners flash neon Manger scenes above
tiny shops where Christmas trees and plastic Santas are sold.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the maze of alleys that is Old Bethlehem opens up into
Manger Square, under construction for celebrations in the year
2000. Near the church built over the traditional birthplace of
Jesus, President Clinton on Tuesday lit a candle on a Christmas
tree decked in red and white velvet ribbons for the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   He had just emerged from the fourth-century grotto with his
wife, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, and their daughter,
Chelsea, to sing Christmas carols with a Palestinian choir. Yasser
Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and his wife, Soha, stood by his
side.
</P>
<P>
   The visit, just before Christmas, was the symbolic part of
Clinton's pre-holiday trip to the Holy Land _ and his first to
Palestinian-ruled soil _ and thousands of Palestinians crammed into
the square to get a glimpse of the presidential family.
</P>
<P>
   ``His visit here is good for us,'' said Issa Sallah, a
Palestinian construction worker standing on tiptoe to get a better
look. ``We hope that Clinton can help us.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how it felt to be in Bethlehem, Clinton said:
``Magnificent, thank you. I'm very grateful for the chance.``
</P>
<P>
   But for Palestinians, it didn't matter what the president said.
To them, his visit, first to Gaza and then to Palestinian-ruled
Bethlehem on the West Bank, signals a new-found friendship that
most here hope can bring substantive gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want Clinton to help free Palestinian prisoners,'' said
Mohammed Odeh, a vegetable vendor standing amid the crowd. ``We
want him to pressure Israel to open the safe passage (route to the
Gaza Strip) and to withdraw the (Israeli) army from the West
Bank.''
</P>
<P>
   To drive the point home, Palestinian strung banners on the main
road leading to Manger Square.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a dream same as yours _ freedom and independence,''
one banner read. ``We ask you to release the Palestinian
prisoners,'' read another.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Clinton expressed sympathy for the children of
Palestinian prisoners during a meeting with four prisoners' young
daughters who had come to meet the president during his visit to
Arafat's office in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   But in Bethlehem, he avoided politics, rarely speaking as he
stepped onto the stage to sing with the choir. Afterward, he shook
the singers' hands and pushed his fist into the air as if to show
appreciation for their songs.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, Palestinians said they hoped Clinton's visit
would give a boost to the city's tourist-based economy, which has
suffered for years from a perception among travelers that it's not
a safe place to go.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, Clinton's visit may have been timely.
Palestinians are hoping to see as many as four million tourists
pass through the city during the year 2000 to celebrate the two
millennia &UR;  &LR; since the birth of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Since August, the Palestinian Authority has been giving Manger
Square a face lift. By the beginning of January, the square, once a
smog-filled parking lot that housed the headquarters of the Israeli
army, will be filled with white sandstone blocks, Cypress trees and
water fountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy here has been so bad for so long,'' said Mona
Issa, a worker at Fatima's Souvenir Shop. ``We hope Clinton's visit
will show people that Bethlehem is a beautiful place to come.''

MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENT MISSING IN CLINTON TRIP

   EREZ CROSSING, Gaza Strip _ After three days of extolling the
benefits of peace to Israelis and Palestinians, President Clinton
returned home Tuesday without major breakthroughs to face the
threat of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The White House says the visit succeeded in reinvesting people
from both sides in the peace process, but it failed to persuade the
Israeli government to stick to an agreed-upon schedule to cede more
West Bank land to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   This had much to do with the fact that Clinton is not the only
one whose political life is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces intense pressure
from far-right members of his coalition who have threatened to
topple his government if he carries out any further Israeli troop
withdrawals from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The deadline for the next phase of the Israeli troop pullbacks
is Friday under an interim land-for-security deal. The
no-confidence vote that could bring down Netanyahu's government is
scheduled for Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Early Tuesday, Clinton tried to close a deal that would get the
halted process back on track, meeting with Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat at the Erez Crossing, which
straddles Israel and Palestinian-controlled Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   But it was clear from the way the 90-minute meeting concluded _
without any joint statement or even the three men posing for a
photo _ that the leaders had not overcome many of the sticking
points. Arafat left the building first.
</P>
<P>
   Still Clinton said he felt things had gone well partly because
they ``got beyond people stating their own positions to actual
conversation, and I'm quite hopeful.''
</P>
<P>
   But Netanyahu was already on the attack, telling reporters that
the Palestinians needed to do much more before Israel would
transfer more land as laid out in the interim accord, which Clinton
helped the two sides hammer out two months ago at the Wye River
Plantation in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did our share in the first stage of the Wye agreements,
what is important now is for the Palestinians to fully do their
share,'' Netanyahu said in a news conference after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In the meeting, Netanyahu refused to agree to live up to the
timetable for the next redeployment and instead handed Clinton and
Arafat a list of 12 alleged Palestinian violations or unfulfilled
obligations of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they do it, I cannot tell you how much time we would take.
The faster they do it, the faster we will redeploy,'' Netanyahu
said.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the 12-point list was Arafat's repeated assertions
that he would unilaterally declare a Palestinian state on May 4,
which marks the end of the five-year timeframe established in the
historic peace accord signed in Oslo in 1993. The 12-point list
also included claims that the Palestinian leadership was inciting
violence on the street directed at Israeli troops and civilians.
</P>
<P>
   After one Palestinian attack earlier this month, Netanyahu
issued an ultimatum saying no more West Bank land would be given
until Arafat clearly rejected his claims to unilaterally declare a
state.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Wye land-for-security accord, Israel is supposed to
redeploy from another 5 percent of West Bank land on Friday. But
the agreement has been implemented in fits and starts, with Israel
accusing the Palestinians of trying to renege on the clauses
calling for them to confiscate illegal weapons, reduce the size of
their police force and halt incitement against Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu said the Palestinians had successfully deleted the
anti-Israel clauses in their national charter during the vote on
Monday in Gaza attended by Clinton. But for the prime minister,
this was just one small part of the many things they must do before
getting more land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tuesday, they did one part, they voted down the charter
because we insisted even though they refused at first,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This mainly shows that we must demand compliance with the
other parts of the agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Palestinians, who are in the weaker position right now,
are very concerned about any slowdown in the Wye accord. Arafat is
struggling to maintain quiet on the street amid growing anger over
the state of the peace process and Israel's refusal to release
political prisoners involved in militant attacks on Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   To convince his people that peace works, Arafat needs to show
real gains. The warm handshakes with Clinton, the first US
president to visit Palestinian-ruled areas, was seen as a symbolic
step in Washington support of Palestinian hopes for an independent
state. But in the meanwhile the Palestinian Authority needs to give
its people more than symbols.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the main reason for Clinton's visit was to restore
hope that peace is doable, and the next morning you hear the Prime
Minister of Israel, who is supposed to be a partner, say the
opposite,'' said Saeb Erekat, chief negotiator for the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   After the morning meeting at Erez, Clinton, his wife Hillary and
Chelsea, spent the day visiting the sites of the Holy Land. In
Bethlehem's Manger Square, the site of the birth of Jesus, they
decorated a Christmas tree and listened to carolers.
</P>
<P>
   They then traveled via helicopter north over the Jordan River
valley to Masada, the ancient fortress where the Jewish Zealots
committed mass suicide rather than live as slaves under the
conquering Romans.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton often evoked theological and religious imagery in his
speeches to Palestinians and Israelis on this trip, underscoring
the president's deep interest in spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   In his Monday speech on the benefits of peace, Clinton said,
``In this small place, the home of Islam, Judaism and Christianity
_ the embodiment of my faith was born a Jew and is still recognized
by Muslims as a prophet. He said a lot of very interesting things.
But in the end he was known as the Prince of Peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton seemed genuinely taken by the significance of the
spiritual sites _ and did advance reading on pertinent biblical
passages from the Jewish Torah and the Christian New Testament,
according to Menachem Genack, a New Jersey rabbi who has become a
friend and counselor to the president on matters of faith and spent
time with the president on his trip to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a spiritual trip for him. I think he is
thinking about his faith especially with all that is going on
around him,'' said Genack. ``For example, Masada emphasizes the
fragility of life here on this earth, the tenuousness we all have.
I think there will be some symbolism there for the President in
terms of his political existence as well.''

<P>
   BOSTON _ Despite some changes over the weekend that decreased
elements of the deal, the New England Patriots and owner Robert
Kraft are the beneficiaries of the most generous stadium financing
agreement ever offered to an National Football League franchise,
most experts agreed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Even in an era when several mid-sized cities _ including
Nashville, Charlotte, St. Louis and Tampa _ have offered NFL owners
lavish terms to secure the status and allure of bigtime
professional sports for their communities, the deal approved by the
Connecticut General Assembly Tuesday to move the Patriots to
Hartford outranks them all, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ought to recognize it's the worst publicly-financed
stadium deal ever done,'' said Mark Rosentraub, director of the
Center for Urban Policy and the Environment at Indiana University.
``And anyone doing it ought to realize that by doing it they have
succeeded mostly in making one owner very wealthy.''
</P>
<P>
   The provisions that makes the agreement on the $375 million
stadium project so strikingly generous are the state guarantees for
premium seating _ potential costs that are not financed as part of
the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The state has agreed to pay for as much as $13 million in luxury
box fees and club seating tickets annually for at least the first
10 years of the Patriots' lease. That potential exposure was
lowered from $17.5 million over the weekend, in a move that
provided some momentum for the vote Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Of all of the recent stadium deals done in the NFL _ some 14
since 1992 _ two provide a guarantee of revenue from admissions.
</P>
<P>
   But in one of the deals, for the Rams in St. Louis, the
guarantee was financed by a private civic group, not the state,
county and city governments that paid for the $280 million RCA
Dome. And unlike the Patriots' deal, the public St. Louis Regional
Conventions and Sports Complex will garner portions of the revenue
from stadium advertising and concessions.
</P>
<P>
   In the other deal, San Diego agreed to buy unsold tickets for
some regular seats as part of an agreement in to refurbish Qualcomm
Stadium, the home of the NFL's Chargers, in 1995. But those tickets
are all for non-premium seats, and the maximum exposure for the
city is less than $2 million per year.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kraft and his son Jonathan have said, at a legislative
hearing in Hartford last week and elsewhere, that they have done a
poor job of explaining their deal with Connecticut. They say, in
part, that a 10 percent ``tax'' on all tickets is expected to
generate as much as $8 million annually for the state. In a sense,
Kraft said, the team is sharing its revenue stream with its
partner.
</P>
<P>
   But some observers say the tax exists only to provide money for
the state' borrowing costs and doesn't really represent a
willingness on Kraft's part to share revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal opinion is that it is priced that way to raise the
revenue for the 10 percent tax, rather than taxing the admission
price that the market will bear,'' said Dean Bonham, of the Bonham
Group in Denver. ``Especially if you are guaranteed the price of
many of the tickets, why not charge as much as you can?''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Kraft has argued against that, saying that the ticket
prices and luxury box fees were calculated independently of the
agreement to provide the state with 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can only charge what the market will bear,'' Kraft said.
``This isn't 10 percent added on top of what we're charging.''
</P>
<P>
   The resulting $8 million annual payment to Connecticut is more
than some owners are contributing to the cost of their new
stadiums, but far less than some others. Georgia received no
payment from the NFL's Falcons when it built the $214 Georgia Dome,
that opened in 1992. And the Rams put up no money when the state of
Missouri, and the county and city of St. Louis paid for the RCA
Dome.
</P>
<P>
   However, Charlotte's $187 million Ericsson Stadium is financed
entirely by the sale of seat licenses and other private sources. In
Washington, D.C., the NFL's Redskins paid $180 million for the $250
million Jack Kent Cooke Stadium project, with public dollars
covering the remaining $70.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Krafts cite two other expenditures, which they say are
significant financial contributions to the deal: $50 million for
the construction of a hotel near the stadium and in the proposed
Adriaen's Landing development and $20 million for an NFL activities
center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never has an NFL team contributed so significantly to the
redevelopment of a city,'' Robert Kraft said, recently.
</P>
<P>
   But observers point out that the Krafts stand to profit
substantially from the spending which, they said, is more in the
nature of an investment than a payment.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, building a hotel directly connected to a convention
center, near and new NFL stadium, amid a lot of redevelopment and
new activities in a city is tantamount to writing a blank check,''
Bonham said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When all things are considered _ the land being for free, the
facility built for free, the state paying for renovations and
maintenance, the naming rights going to the team, the annual
guarantees, and the obvious potential for revenue from the hotel
and the activities center _ there has never been anything like
this,'' he said. ``There is nothing in the NFL, there is nothing in
professional sports, that compares with this deal.''

TRIAL OF LOCKERBIE SUSPECTS A STEP CLOSER 
</HEADLINE>

 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Days before the 10th anniversary of the bombing of
a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, Libya's legislative body has
taken a step toward allowing two suspects to be put on trial in a
neutral country.
</P>
<P>
   Libya's General People's Congress has approved of a request by
the United States and Britain to hold a trial in the Netherlands,
according to a Libyan TV broadcast Tuesday. The legislators also
called on Libya, Britain, and the United States to ``remove any
obstacle'' blocking the start of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the US government and the United Nations said the
reports were a good sign, but academics who specialize in
international law said the trial in the Netherlands raises tricky
legal questions. Once such international prosecutions in third
countries begin, US officials and agents involved in covert actions
might face similar proceedings, said Al Rubin, a professor of
international law at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at
Tufts University.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole thing is very weird,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Under a plan that UN Secretary General Kofi Annan presented 10
days ago in a visit to Libya, the country's leader, Moammar
Khadafy, must surrender the two suspects for a trial. The United
Nations has kept an air and arms embargo on Libya, and has frozen
the country's assets abroad over the Dec. 21, 1988, bombing, which
many US officials say Khadafy masterminded.
</P>
<P>
   Years of wrangling, negotiations, and accusations have failed to
solve the crime, which killed 270 people, including 23 from New
England. Relatives of the victims are angry and US officials warn
that those behind the bombing must be convicted and imprisoned if
potential terrorists are to be deterred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice has been delayed for almost 10 years . . . It is time
for Libya to meet its obligations,'' said a White House spokesman,
P. J. Crowley.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations, a senior official expressed hope tinged
by skepticism that the trial of the two men is imminent. ``We'll
believe it when we see them on the airplane'' coming to the
Netherlands, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sketchy news from Libya left Khadafy room Tuesday to maneuver
and backtrack. The General People's Congress, composed of about 500
representatives from lower level assemblies, is controlled by
Khadafy but he has not publicly endorsed the decision. And the
announcement did not answer logistical questions, such as how Libya
would deliver the two suspects, who are believed to be government
agents.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, detectives tracked a suitcase with a bomb on the plane
to two men, Abdul Basset Ali Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah. US
officials indicted them. Their lawyer, Frank Rubino, says they are
innocent. Libya has refused to deport them.
</P>
<P>
   If the suspects are sent to trial, ``it is a major development,
clearly a victory for international adjudication and the
possibility of the victims' families getting some sense of
justice,'' said Christopher C. Joyner, a professor of international
law at Georgetown University. Also, he said, any capitulation by
Khadafy would be a sign that sanctions are squeezing Libya.
</P>
<P>
   But Joyner, too, voiced doubts. ``The major question that is
unanswered: Why would Khadafy want to go forward with the trial,
allow these two individuals to speak out in public and perhaps
implicate him?''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin and other specialists say it will be difficult to set the
rules for a trial for a crime that allegedly was committed by
Libyans in international air space, involving an American airliner
that took off from British soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are going to be the judges?'' asked Rubin, the Tufts
professor, who has served as chairman of a terrorism committee of
the 130-year-old International Law Association. ``Does the Scottish
law apply in the case? How are these two guys supposed to get to
Netherlands, and what happens to them if they are convicted?''
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, the men would be tried under Scottish law
and serve time in Britain if convicted. But Libya's foreign affairs
minister, Omar Mustapha al-Montasser, has said that his country
wanted the two suspects to be jailed in Libya if found guilty.

<P>
   RICHMOND HEIGHTS, Mo. _ Santa Claus pushed himself off his
throne and stroked the bridge of his big, cherry-red nose. ``I
think President Clinton is a sleaze,'' he said. ``Definitely, they
should impeach him. Frankly, I don't care what they do, as long as
they get rid of him.''
</P>
<P>
   His chief helper sidled over from behind the cash register in
her velvety uniform and beefeater hat. ``I'm sorry, I don't care
what Santa thinks,'' said Lisa Jackson, 45, from St. Peters. ``I
sure hope they don't impeach the president. He's only got a year
left. The people are trying to tell the Congress what they want,
but the Congress won't listen.''
</P>
<P>
   In nearly three-dozen interviews conducted over two days at
locations around the St. Louis suburb of Richmond Heights,
including the St. Louis Galleria mall, where Jack Sim, 63, of
nearby St. John, was portraying Santa, there was no consensus on
impeachment. The greater number of people wished some face-saving
compromise could be found to let the president finish out his term
and a sizable minority wanted the President punished immediately
and to the fullest extent of the law.
</P>
<P>
   What was striking in Richmond Heights was the hardening of
attitudes and the relative dearth of those occupying the middle
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Richmond Heights is a small suburb of 10,448 people, five miles
west of St. Louis. From its highest point on Clayton Road, St.
Louis slides down toward the Mississippi River, the stumps of the
downtown office towers framed in the great bell curve of the
Gateway Arch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're that new buzz word, the inner-ring suburb,'' explained
Patrick Brennan, the mayor of Richmond Heights. And yet, for a
small suburb it is uncommonly diverse, economically, politically
and racially.
</P>
<P>
   The population is 8,623 white, 1,587 black, with the remainder
comprising relatively tiny groups of Asians, Hispanics and American
Indians. The median family income in 1989, the most recent figure
available, was $42,431; the median value of a house, $82,300.
</P>
<P>
   But there is wide disparity here. Houses on the west side, near
the tonier suburbs of Clayton and Ladue, are great edifices of
brick and stucco set on grand, sloping lawns and costing into the
millions of dollars. On the south side, there is a small
working-class neighborhood, mostly black, left from the days when
the suburb's chief employer was a brick factory. In the center are
winding suburban roads lined with duplexes and single-family homes,
that gradually ratchet their way up from middle- to
upper-middle-class as the suburb reaches westward.
</P>
<P>
   The town is predominantly Catholic in the middle-class
neighborhoods on the central and south side, nearest St. Louis, and
the voters are mostly Democrats, Brennan said. To the west, in the
fancier stretches, the vote turns Republican and the churches
become Protestant.
</P>
<P>
   The voters here tend to elect a mix of Democrats and Republicans
and to swing back and forth from one Presidential campaign to the
next, said Richard Bauer, a spokesman for the St. Louis County
Board of Elections. Currently, Republicans represent the suburb in
the legislature and a Democrat, Rep. William Clay, in Congress. In
1996, Clinton received 51.4 percent of the vote and Bob Dole, 38.9
percent. In 1992, Clinton received 51 percent, George Bush, 31.7
percent, and Ross Perot, 17.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In interviews this week, a kind of steeliness seemed to settle
on peoples' faces _ even that of Santa Claus _ when they were asked
about impeachment. Nearly all respondents proved to be well-versed
on the process. And most everyone seemed to understand the nuances
of the opinions on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Also striking was the near-total absence of affection or respect
for the president. Even those who more fervently argued against
impeachment had little but cold indifference for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Republicans really go ahead and impeach him, like it
seems they will, then I think he ought to resign instead of putting
the country through a trial in the Senate,'' said Candy Prentice,
43, a bookkeeper. ``It breaks my heart, but I think it's the best
way for him to go.''
</P>
<P>
   All but three of those interviewed said they had made up their
minds months ago. The three who changed their minds all had moved
against the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``That speech Clinton gave last Friday did it for me,'' said
Chuck Schierer, 26, a third-year law student at Washington
University who was surfing the Web at the public library. ``He is
still not willing to tell the truth. He can end this anytime he
wants, you know, by resigning. So I say he's played games with us
for eight months, now it's time to play games with him.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Richmond Heights V.F.W. Post 3500, flying the flag over
Big Bend Boulevard since 1950, six veterans from Korea and World
War II were sitting around drinking coffee and beer, talking about
the St. Louis Rams victory last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of the men favored impeachment. ``He's not fit to be
president,'' said Vince Rankin, 83, who parachuted into France on
D-Day with the 82nd Airborne Division. Using a vulgarity to refer
to the president, Rankin said his objection to Clinton is that he
is a ``draft dodger.''
</P>
<P>
   But the other five contended, just as strongly, that the
president had been trapped into lying about his sex life, which was
nobody's business. ``A man's sex life and his religion are his own
business,'' said Ed McEntee, who served in the South Pacific during
World War II. ``I think it's all a politically motivated thing. The
Republicans are trying to cancel out the last presidential
election.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Tropicana Lanes, five retired women were meeting for
their regular Monday morning bowling. ``We're not in a league,''
said Maureen Krabbe from nearby Crestwood, ``We're a league of our
own.'' Opinions here were firmly held and decidedly against the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely think he should be impeached,'' said Jean Graham,
a retired bookkeeper from nearby Kirkwood. ``The problem is that
people don't realize that even if he's impeached, it doesn't mean
he would be removed from office. There would still be a trial in
the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   At an adjacent lane, Lois Hert, a waitress from Arnold, Mo.,
quietly shook her head and said she disagreed. ``To a certain
extent, I'm sick of it,'' she said. ``I think everyone's sick of
it. But I think the Senate and the Congress have got better things
to do with their time than this. Don't they? I hope they do.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Richmond Heights Public Library, which will move into new
spacious quarters when the community center is finished, one of the
librarians, Linda Underwood, was returning books to the shelves.
``You know, I think the president is a very good person,'' she
said, sadly. ``Look at him. He's off in the Middle East, doing the
job we elected him to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's despicable what they're doing to him,'' she said.
``And it's so clearly a political thing. They've been trying to get
him ever since he got into office and now, I'm afraid they're going
to finish the job.''

ASIAN LEADERS EXPECTED TO EASE TRADE, INVESTMENT RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Over the last year and a half, everyone from Asian
prime ministers to American politicians to international fund
managers has offered solutions to a vexing financial crisis that
has ravaged what was the world's fastest-growing region.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Southeast Asian leaders are expected to liberalize
trade and investment rules to lure money back to Asia. Leaders of
the nine-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations meeting in
Hanoi will present a package of immodestly labeled ``bold
measures,'' including corporate tax exemptions, permission for
foreign ownership of certain ventures and tariff reductions.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath ASEAN's veneer of consensus lies a widely
contradictory set of economic policies, and a deep philosophical
divide over whether the best way to overcome the economic turmoil
is by opening markets or closing them.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, seventeen months into Asia's worst financial crisis in
half a century, leaders are still debating whether free markets
were not only the cause of record growth but also the root of
financial vulnerability and collapse. The lack of a coherent,
consistent response to the slump suggests that a reliable diagnosis
and region-wide recovery are a long way off.
</P>
<P>
   ``When consensus forms, there's stability. When there's no
consensus, there's volatility,'' said Christopher Lingle, an
economist and author of The Rise and Decline of the Asian Century.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over how to address the crisis also underscores
a clash of ideologies _ over free markets versus protectionism and
democracy versus authoritarianism. That debate has become a
generational tug-of-war, as many older and entrenched leaders have
tried to hold back modernization, while newly elected or younger
leaders have mostly pushed for reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The authoritarianism that everybody was praising for so long
as Asian values _ with leaders like (Singapore's) Lee Kuan Yew and
(Malaysia's) Mahathir Mohamad _ was just a way of justifying an
authoritarian government,'' said Ken Davies, an economist and chief
Asian editor of the Economist Intelligence Unit. ``Now the theory
is being disproved by Asians themselves _ by the Taiwanese, the
South Koreans and the Thais.''
</P>
<P>
   A dramatic dichotomy over how the address the crisis has emerged
between ASEAN members Thailand and Malaysia. Thai Prime Minister
Chuan, who last year unseated a government that presided over the
collapse of the Thai currency, has liberalized markets and
restructured financial institutions. Despite political opposition
at home, he has won praise for adhering to reforms demanded as
conditions of a multi-billion-dollar International Monetary Fund
bailout.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir has blamed
foreign speculators for his nation's problems, and three months ago
alienated international investors by imposing capital controls to
protect markets from outside influences. He also infuriated Western
governments by jailing his free market-oriented finance minister on
sodomy and corruption charges, a move Mahathir's critics say he
took to defend his dwindling authority.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Malaysia's much-maligned response to the crisis has not been
entirely one-sided. Even as Mahathir criticized foreign
stockbrokers, he liberalized foreign ownership of stock brokerages
and telecom companies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, whether a government reacts in the main to the crisis by
turning inward or outward depends on what leaders see as the root
of their woes. ``Mahathir's view is that this is the result of
speculators, so his solution is to stop speculators. But if you
take the view that this is only part of it, and there were other
structural problems, then you will try to solve those structural
problems as Thailand and South Korea are trying to do,'' said Bruce
Gale, Southeast Asia regional manager for Political and Economic
Risk Consultancy.
</P>
<P>
   The divergence between Asian neighbors over how to solve the
crisis has repeated itself elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   After Hong Kong's government intervened in the stock market to
defend its currency in August, rival city-state Singapore cut
capital ratio requirements and investor incentives to capitalize on
Hong Kong's apparent backsliding on free-market principles. The
policy debate came into stark relief two weeks ago when the
Washington, D.C.-based Heritage Foundation warned Hong Kong that it
would lose its title as the world's freest economy to Singapore
because of the $15 billion stock buying spree.
</P>
<P>
   There are many investors, however, such as Giampaolo Guarnieri,
director of Asia Pacific equities for Salomon Smith Barney, who say
Hong Kong has done nothing to restrict capital or investment. Even
after Hong Kong's market intervention, he said, it is still a freer
and more transparent place to do business than anywhere else in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Singapore is a place where the government intervenes in
everything _ you can't even chew gum. Right now they happen to be
intervening to make the economy better, so that's good _ but it's
still intervention,'' Guarnieri said. Nevertheless, he praised
efforts there and elsewhere to open markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend is for economies to basically open up, allow more
foreign investment in various sectors, which is new in certain
Asian countries. The trend for financial markets is to be better
controlled and regulated,'' he said, adding that Hong Kong's new
rules on short-selling stock merely mirror regulations in the
United States. ``Before, it was complete cowboy land here.''
</P>
<P>
   Policy debates exist not only between neighbors, but also within
countries. In Indonesia and South Korea, where new presidents have
tried to open markets and eliminate privileges, opposition from
entrenched business interests has made a consistent national policy
response impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Vvested interests and ideological differences have also
agreement on regional recovery plans elusive. A month ago, leaders
who gathered for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in
Kuala Lumpur failed to agree on a plan for reviving the region. And
though ASEAN is expected to announce a regional free trade zone by
2002, analysts say policies implemented by each country will
influence investors far more than collective promises.
</P>
<P>
   That is partly because ASEAN is seen by many as a toothless
tiger, allowing members to do as they like and fudge deadlines.
More importantly, agreement on what caused the crisis must come
before a regional blueprint for its solution.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Faber, managing director of his own investment firm here,
disagrees with those who say Asia will emerge from the crisis freer
and less feudal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the whole crisis will strengthen the old Asian system,
because it has created animosity to Western capitalism. Most
businessmen don't blame themselves for the crisis; they blame the
Western system or Western speculators,'' Faber said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Guarnieri says public opinion has been too harsh
on Asia. ``They expect Asian people and governments to take steps
that took the US and Europe decades,'' he said. ``We've got
economies who've built overcapacity in record time, and boom _ the
financial sector explodes and they have to reform. Give them time.
They've already implemented changes in record time.''

<P>
   The networks will be there. But will the viewers?
</P>
<P>
   As TV prepares to cover impeachment proceedings that begin
Thursday in the House of Representatives _ the first such event in
the electronic media age _ there is serious doubt as to whether
anything approaching a large audience will tune in.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a time to start paying attention, now is it,''
says Frank Sesno, CNN's Washington bureau chief.
</P>
<P>
   When the debate begins at 10 a.m. Thursday, at least eight TV
networks (broadcast and cable) will snap to attention. The ``Big
3'' anchors _ Tom Brokaw, Dan Rather and Peter Jennings _ will all
be in Washington, D.C., along with their corps of analysts and
correspondents. And when the House takes its definitive vote,
possibly late Thursday or Friday, coverage should be significant.
</P>
<P>
   But while CNN and C-SPAN are touting gavel-to-gavel live
coverage, the big broadcasters _ ABC, CBS and NBC _ will not make
that commitment in advance. When independent counsel Ken Starr
testified last month, all three started out with live coverage in
the morning, then switched back to soap operas in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to tell how the day is going to go,'' says ABC News
spokeswoman Eileen Murphy. ``Certainly we'll cover the vote live,
no matter when it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   If a House vote occurs in early evening or prime time, it's
possible an audience in the tens of millions might watch. But if it
happens during the day, it's unlikely the nation will come to a
standstill and gather around TV sets, the way it did for the O.J.
Simpson criminal trial verdict, when Nielsen Media Survey estimated
150 million Americans watched.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no good guys in this story,'' says Mary Ann Watson,
author of ``Defining Visions: Television and the American
Experience Since 1945.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In O.J. and Watergate, there was someone to root for. Even if
you thought O.J. was guilty, you could root for Christopher Darden.
That might be part of the ambivalence,'' she adds
</P>
<P>
   Watson says television (and its audience) has changed so much
since coverage of the Watergate hearings in 1973 (Senate) and 1974
(House Judiciary) that it's impossible to compare. During
Watergate, ABC, CBS and NBC rotated coverage, and PBS aired re-runs
of the hearings during prime time.
</P>
<P>
   The year-long Clinton scandal will be remembered not so much for
the live coverage, but for the outpouring of partisan spinners and
analysts filling talk shows such as ``Larry King Live'' and
``Geraldo Live'' every night, frequently speculating over one tiny
leak.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so different from Watergate,'' Watson says.
``Professors stopped classes and said this is something important
we have to watch and discuss. That idea of a common sense of we're
all in this together is missing this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is the schedule of upcoming TV coverage. It is subject to
change.
</P>
<P>
   _ ABC will pre-empt ``20/20'' at 10 tonight for a special
anchored by Peter Jennings, ``A Presidency at the Crossroads.'' At
11:35 p.m., ``Nightline'' is expected to devote its time to the
House vote tonight and Thursday; guests have not been determined.
ABC, CBS and NBC all plan to begin live coverage at 10 a.m.
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   _ CNN will air a special at 10 tonight, ``Investigating the
President: A Question of Impeachment,'' anchored by Bernard Shaw,
Judy Woodruff and Jeff Greenfield. Gavel-to-gavel coverage will
begin at 9 a.m. Thursday. Another CNN prime-time special will air
at 10 p.m. Thursday. ``Larry King Live'' guests at 9 tonight
include Ben Bradlee, Leon Panetta and Judge Robert Bork. King's
guests Thursday include Brokaw and Alan Dershowitz.
</P>
<P>
   _ PBS plans extensive live coverage, anchored by Jim Lehrer.
Both Atlanta PBS member stations _ WGTV/Channel 8 and WPBA/Channel
30 _ will carry PBS coverage.
</P>
<P>
   _ C-SPAN: Live gavel-to-gavel coverage begins at 10 a.m.
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   _ MSNBC and Fox News Channel both plan heavy coverage.

 &HT;    Oil company exodus worries New Orleans
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ While most drivers are rejoicing as they fill
their cars with the cheapest gas in memory, New Orleanians have
reason to worry, turning nervous eyes toward Poydras Street.
</P>
<P>
   Low gas prices and giant oil company mergers have spelled job
losses along Poydras Street, the central business district home to
thousands of workers with Shell, Texaco, Exxon, Mobil, Amoco and
Chevron. And layoffs conjure ghosts of the 1980s, when oil went
bust and New Orleans prosperity went with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you use the word `bust?' Yeah, I think you can,'' said
Brian Schwarner, spokesman for the New Orleans and the River Region
Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   In August, when British Petroleum PLC agreed to buy Amoco for
$53 billion, Amoco promptly announced it was pulling all of its 280
jobs out of Louisiana, including 200 workers from Poydras Street.
In October, Shell cut 700 jobs from its U.S. division, most in
Louisiana and Houston. And most recently, Exxon Corp. agreed to buy
Mobil Corp., placing in jeopardy 6,000 Exxon and Mobil workers in
Louisiana, more than 600 of them in New Orleans. Texaco has cut
jobs here as well.
</P>
<P>
   But is this 1986 all over again, when stores boarded up, oil
service industries went belly up and the city almost buckled under
spiralling debt?
</P>
<P>
   ``It has the potential to be, but I don't think so,'' Schwarner
said. ``In the 1980s, New Orleans was pretty much a one-horse town
and the horse was oil. But the economy has done a little
diversifying, and it's significant enough to keep an oil bust from
repeating itself on the magnitude it had in the late eighties.''
</P>
<P>
   In the '80s, 40 percent of the state's budget came from oil
companies. When they suffered, so too did the state. Today, only 14
percent of the budget comes from oil. The state now relies more
heavily on sales taxes and other fees from conventions and tourism,
riverboat gambling and video poker.
</P>
<P>
   And in the '80s, it took five years, from 1981 to 1986, for
prices to fall to their lowest levels. This time, oil prices went
into freefall, falling from more than $20 a barrel to around $10 a
barrel in just 14 months. Analysts say a steeper decline means a
more rapid recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is the prices can't go much lower,'' said Larry
Wall of the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association.
</P>
<P>
   Wall and others say that New Orleans will continue to be an oil
town for a long time to come, but it's going to be a different kind
of oil town.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the future of this area's oil industry lies far out
in the Gulf of Mexico, where new technology is enabling deep-water
drilling in previously unexplored regions. These are enormously
expensive, long-term projects that could pay off in the discovery
of vast new reserves of oil. Deepwater drilling in the Gulf gives
oil companies a reason to maintain a presence in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   However, two of the leaders in deep-water drilling, Chevron and
Shell, are rumored to be discussing a merger. If that occurs, it
seems certain they will consolidate their New Orleans headquarters,
spurring yet more job losses.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, deep-water drilling so far has not been as
successful as expected, said Lewis Ropp, an analyst with Howard,
Weil, Labouisse, Friedrichs in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost of deep-water has gone up considerably,'' he said.
``And reliability issues are just starting to surface, so there are
additional costs there. Some people are wondering if in this price
environment they want to be in deep-water.''
</P>
<P>
   Drilling and equipping one well in waters thousands of feet deep
costs about $8 million, compared with $500,000 for a land well.
That kind of expense will be hard to justify as long as oil prices
remain low.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is certainly a very ugly environment,'' Ropp said.
</P>
<P>
   And as if all that weren't bad enough, earlier this month,
Texaco dropped $70 million worth of equipment from a crane into the
Gulf. Whether the company can retrieve it is uncertain, but it is
certain the accident will delay deep-water exploration.
</P>
<P>
   But despite all these recent setbacks, deep-water exploration is
a long-term project that may be delayed but not abandoned. And as
long as there is Gulf oil to be found, New Orleans will have a
future as an oil town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have said that once the majors like Amoco move out
of New Orleans, they won't return,'' Ropp said. ``But frankly from
a logistical perspective, New Orleans will continue to be an
important focal point for the industry. It just may be more a place
for smaller field offices.''

CIVICS AND HISTORY CLASSROOMS DEBATE THE PRESIDENT'S FATE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JACQUES STEINBERG    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Their textbooks in their backpacks, the 28 seventh-
and eighth-graders in Jonathan Foy's Harlem classroom pushed their
desks out of the way Tuesday morning and arrayed their chairs in
the center of the room as if it were the floor of the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we're going to do in two periods what Congress can't do
in over a month's time,' Foy told his social studiesclass at the
Adam Clayton Powell Study Center for Law and Peace, a middle
school. ``We're going to figure out what to do with President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, they began voting with their feet: those who believed the
president should be impeached were sent to sit on the right side,
those who disagreed were dispatched to the left and any undecided's
sat in the middle. The students were free to move as their opinions
changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand he lied,'' said Terranie McKenzie, 13, rising
from her seat on the left as if at a New Hampshire town meeting,
her finger jabbing her colleagues. ``That has nothing to do with
his work and how he's doing his thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlton Hardee, 13, stood tall on the right, countering that the
president had become irrevocably distracted. ``His head isn't on
straight,'' said Carlton, a yellow sweatshirt serving as his sober
blue suit. ``How's he going to take care of all the people in
America? If he goes to pass a bill or law, people are going to be
skeptical about why he's doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not since communism fell and rendered Cold War-era textbooks
passe have social studies and civics teachers faced a target that
has shifted as rapidly as the Lewinsky matter _ a subject whose
enormity could not possibly have been anticipated by the course
materials that they selected at the beginning of the school year.
</P>
<P>
   Charged with becoming authorities on a subject that even the
most authoritative scholars have yet to agree on, many of the
nation's middle school and high school teachers have had little
choice but to adopt the approach of Foy: opening up their classes
to passionate debate, with freshly clipped copies of the Articles
of Impeachment and excerpts from the president's various statements
serving as guideposts.
</P>
<P>
   At Los Angeles High School Tuesday morning, Jennifer Azure's
fourth-period government class should have been working on a draft
of a new student body constitution, one that stipulates that bad
grades and poor attendance are grounds for removal from the student
council. But instead, the talk was of the U.S. Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should we impeach him?'' said Sara Iraheta, born in 1981,
``when that Reagan guy gave or sold weapons to that other country.
He could have put us in danger of getting bombed or killed.''
</P>
<P>
   At New Trier High School in Winnetka, Ill., Kerry Hall has taken
to bringing a transistor radio to class to keep his students
abreast of the latest news. Last week, he asked them to listen to
live debate by the members of the House Judiciary Committee and to
try to pick out whether a Republican or Democrat was speaking.
(``It usually took them at most 20 seconds,'' he said.) Since then,
they have been writing letters to their representative, John
Potter, a moderate Republican believed to still be on the fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a textbook on how to teach this so it's
unprecedented,'' Hall said during a break. ``But it's also very
exciting and ground-breaking. I'm a historian, so I don't think the
kids appreciate some of the historic significance as much as I do.
But they certainly recognize its importance.''
</P>
<P>
   For many social studies teachers, the time spent on the subject
of constitutional crisis has represented a marked shift from the
past, when impeachment might have rated only a sentence or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would mention Andrew Johnson and say he was saved by one
vote,'' said Nancy Cohen, an eighth-grade social studies teacher at
Day Middle School in Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, though, Ms. Cohen's students spent much of the period
marking up the articles of impeachment, labeling the charges
``political'' or ``personal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We discussed whether that's what the founding fathers had in
mind,'' she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For teachers, there is always a dilemma over how much of
themselves to inject into classroom discussion, but in her Los
Angeles classroom, Ms. Hazure told her students up front how she
believed the Republicans had treated the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are upset with the fact that he is very creative with the
truth,'' she told her class. ``They are mad because they can't
catch him in a lie. They've been trying to get him for so many
years, and when they finally thought they had him, there was a
technicality in the way he said it.''
</P>
<P>
   Joey Cabrera, a 16-year-old, wasn't buying that logic, though,
and wasn't afraid to tell his teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should have thought about what he did before he did it,''
Joey said. ``He must have been a total idiot to think he is the
president of the United States and that whatever he did wouldn't
come out.''
</P>
<P>
   As class got underway Tuesday at the Study Center for Law and
Peace in Harlem, a small public academy of 200 students that is
sponsored by New Visions for Public Schools, Foy was circumspect
about his opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he began with a recitation of some of the facts, asking
the students to read various quotations from the president that he
had downloaded from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Question: Did you have an extramarital sexual affair with
Monica Lewinsky?'' asked Derrell Thomas, reading an excerpt from
the president's Jan. 17 deposition in the Paula Jones case.
``Answer: No. Question: If she told someone that she had a sexual
affair with you beginning in November of 1995, would that be a lie?
Answer: It's certainly not the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of the next 90 minutes, Foy's students would
arrange themselves in various configurations. First he asked them
to seat themselves based on whether they believed the president had
lied in that deposition. Their positions were fluid: At one point,
there were 15 who contended the president lied, 11 who disagreed
and 2 in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he lied,'' said Derrell, 13, weathering the rising
heat in the room in a simple white t-shirt. ``When you swear on a
bible, you are supposed to tell the truth, the whole truth and
nothing but the truth. He didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Foy: ``That's a good point.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ronald Jarvis, 14, was less impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did he do anything to abuse his power?'' Ronald asked. ``This
is what goes on in his bedroom. It's his business.''
</P>
<P>
   By 11:20, when Foy called the vote, 14 said the president had
lied, 10 said he hadn't and 4 remained undecided.
</P>
<P>
   But when Foy asked the students to rearrange themselves based on
whether the president should be impeached, the turnaround was
swift: 25 lined up against impeachment, two in favor of it and only
one undecided.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you lie up on the stand, you have to restore that
trust,'' said Stephanie Campusano, 13, speaking for the minority.
``I think he can't.''
</P>
<P>
   But she was drowned out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should he have to restore his trust to us,'' said Seretta
Stilley, 13. ``He didn't do anything to us.''

MARKET RALLIES AS DOW, BUOYED BY GE, RISES 127.70
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks broke a four-session losing streak Tuesday, a
reversal traders and analysts said was a rebound from a selloff
that had gone too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had a lousy three or four days in a row, and we were
oversold,'' said Andrew Brooks, a vice president in charge of
equity trading at T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Market sentiment was bolstered by an upbeat meeting that General
Electric had with analysts late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting, GE chairman and chief executive John F. Welch
said earnings for the current quarter and for all of 1999 would
meet expectations. In the wake of recent profit warnings from other
big companies, the forecast from GE provided some reassurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a technical reversal that General Electric was part
of,'' one equity trader, who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
said of Tuesday's market move. ``There is still a lot of bearish
sentiment, but I like the market at these levels. I am not a
roaring bull, but I think by the end of this week we will be back
above the 9,000 level'' for the Dow Jones industrial average. The
Dow rose 127.70 points, or 1.5 percent, Tuesday, to 8,823.30.
</P>
<P>
   Broader market measures did even better. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index gained 21.63 points, or 1.9 percent, to 1,162.83.
And the Nasdaq composite index, which fell sharply Monday, regained
a good deal of the ground it lost, rising 45.68 points, or 2.32
percent, to 2,012.60. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company
stocks, however, gained just 1.63 points, or four-tenths of a
percent, to 389.57.
</P>
<P>
   GE was the engine driving the Dow higher. The stock jumped 6
7/16, to 93[.
</P>
<P>
   But other big-name Dow components also posted hefty gains.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola, which issued a fourth-quarter earnings warning last
week, rose 2{, to 65 15/16. Procter &AMP; Gamble, which also expects to
report lower-than-expected earnings, rose 2~, to 89{. And American
Express gained 3\, to 94}.
</P>
<P>
   Takeover news helped lift several issues, including General
Instrument, Coltec Industries and Enron Oil &AMP;d Gas.
</P>
<P>
   General Instrument gained 3 11/16, to 34\, on word that Royal
Philips Electronics, Europe's largest consumer electronics maker,
was in talks to buy or form a joint venture with the company, which
is the largest U.S. maker of cable television set-top boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Coltec rose 2, to 18 11/16, after Crane offered to buy the maker
of airplane parts for $1.6 billion and filed a lawsuit to block a
takeover bid by B.F. Goodrich .
</P>
<P>
   Enron Oil &AMP; Gas gained 2|, to 15{, after Enron Corp. said it had
received an offer to buy its stake in the oil and gas production
company. Enron would not identify the potential buyer.
</P>
<P>
   The day's gains in the overall market were not broad based: 16
stocks rose for every 15 that fell on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some analysts said they thought the
biggest-capitalization stocks, which have been driving the market's
advance for the last several years, could rally further.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought the market was between 500 and 600 points
undervalued when the Dow was trading around 8,600,'' said Stuart
Freeman, chief equity strategist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are going to have a year-end rally that will
continue into the first few months of next year,'' he added. ``We
think there is a good chance the Dow will hit 10,000 by early
March.''

ART AND SCIENCE SING THE BODY TRANSPARENT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 20) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By VICKI GOLDBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Late in the 19th century, writers and artists, harassed by
realism and the tyranny of fact, began to call for introspection,
reliance on emotion, investigation of fantasy and dream. As early
as 1858, Baudelaire railed against photography and art's slavish
reproduction of nature. ``Each day art further diminishes its
self-respect by bowing down before external reality,'' he said,
adding that ``nevertheless, (italics)it is a happiness to
dream.''(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   In 1881 another Frenchman called for ``a poetry that would be
psychology in the form of a dream.'' Shortly afterward, yet another
said, ``Thus we carry the analysis of the Self to the extreme.'' A
desire to explore the interior of the mind was in the air, and it
may not be sheer coincidence that Freud (who had worked in Paris in
1886) wrote his ``Interpretation of Dreams'' (published in 1900)
while the Symbolist movement in art and literature was in full cry.
</P>
<P>
   But it (italics)was(end italics) mere coincidence that at the
same time, it became possible for almost anyone to see the interior
of the body. In late 1895, Wilhelm Roentgen, a German physicist,
discovered by chance that invisible rays made certain compounds
fluoresce.
</P>
<P>
   Testing to see what materials these strange rays could pierce,
he held up a piece of lead before his apparatus; no rays went
through. Yet to his amazement, he saw the silhouette of the bones
of his thumb and finger that were holding the metal. He had
stumbled onto the X-ray.
</P>
<P>
   The Julie Saul Gallery in SoHo has had the piquant idea of
displaying together early medical X-rays and more recent works of
art that borrow from X-rays and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).
The exhibition, ``Skin/Deep: A Survey of Interior Imaging From
X-Ray to MRI'' (through Jan. 16), assembles approximately 40 images
from 1896 to the 1990s _ not exactly a survey but proof once more
of how eager art has been to pilfer from the treasury of science
and how readily scientific images seen in an art context assume
some of the characteristics of art.
</P>
<P>
   Bones are familiar enough by now and anyway were cleverly enough
designed to have a certain elegance themselves (at least if they
belong to someone else). Anomalies in the early examples of X-rays
on view are particularly interesting: two shirt buttons perfectly
visible between the bones of an arm; the care that a medical
scrapbook from World War I takes to point out that an X-ray of six
fingers and six toes is not like X-rays of normal hands; a blurry
X-ray that looks like nothing so much as an Abstract Expressionist
charcoal drawing. Three 1950s cyanotypes (blueprints) are not only
blue but distort the human torso, having been made from slices cut
longitudinally through a frozen corpse.
</P>
<P>
   MRI, which was not widely used until the 1980s, also makes
slices through the body but leaves it intact, mapping it by
coordinates that can then be converted into images. This slicing
effect is made beautifully clear in Justine Cooper's ``Self
Portrait,'' a series of clear plastic plates suspended an inch or
so apart in a stack.
</P>
<P>
   Each plate has a flat image of a ``slice'' through Cooper's
skull, starting with the top of her head and descending to the
neck. Viewed from the front, the images coalesce into what looks
like a dark, fully three-dimensional head encased in parallel
planes of glass.
</P>
<P>
   A more startlingly sliced-up body appears on a video of the
Visible Human Project, the world's first computerized library of
human anatomy, available on the Web and in the gallery, in which a
cadaver that was mapped by modern technology in every dimension and
system can be viewed as its skin, muscles, blood supply route,
organs, whatever, are quickly peeled away.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately the corpse, lying with its head facing the viewer, is
cut through horizontally slice by slice and each cut swiftly
discarded _ ``like we're nothing more than bologna,'' as Julie Saul
remarked one day with a laugh. After the last slice, the screen
goes blank.
</P>
<P>
   When the press published pictures of X-rays in 1896 within weeks
of the announcement of Roentgen's discovery, the world became
instantly aware that it was witnessing a kind of miracle. The
nature of the miracle was clear enough, but not the details. A
photography magazine wrote: ``I hear they'll gaze/Thro' cloak and
gown _ and even stays,/These naughty, naughty Roentgen Rays.''
</P>
<P>
   (Roentgen refused to name a force of nature after himself or to
patent the phenomenon that he thought belonged to humanity. He was
awarded the first Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery.)
</P>
<P>
   The hand-held camera was at that period threatening people's
sense of privacy by catching them in ungainly positions or unseemly
situations; some thought the X-ray would threaten the mind's
privacy as well (just as its secrets were being vaunted by artists
and investigated by Freud).
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we tell,'' another photography magazine asked, ``that
one's very thoughts may not be laid open to this new power which
passed through all fleshy disguises as easily as light does through
glass.''
</P>
<P>
   It is almost impossible to comprehend how great the change was
between the unquestioning acceptance of the physical law that eyes
cannot see through opaque solids, including flesh, and the sudden
exposure of the body's structure beneath the skin.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat earlier in the century, photographs had been made of
the interior of dissected corpses, even of a few interior areas of
the living body, but the lay public had not seen them. It was
because X-rays could produce photographs and photographs could be
reproduced in the press that people everywhere had such an
immediate understanding of what these peculiar rays could do.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Photography had already revealed movement too swift for human
perception; now the medium, joined to a new instrument, affirmed
that what was visible was far from the entire reality.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment this happened, science was already altering the
human paradigm and the concept of the physical world past
recognition. Objects like metals that everyone knew stood still and
human bodies even in peaceful slumber were said to be composed of
atoms constantly moving about.
</P>
<P>
   The visible world had once been all that anyone had; now there
was incontrovertible proof that there was more, and that human
beings had been handed a new key to profound secrets.
</P>
<P>
   And under the impact of X-rays, this too too solid flesh had
melted. One could prefigure one's own death, seeing the skeleton
that represented death itself in painting and sculpture, or
contemplate a lurking sentence of death and the possibility of
rescue in the image of a tumor.
</P>
<P>
   But the imaging system could bring not only the news of death
but the fact itself. No one knew for a couple of years how
destructive the side effects of X-rays were, and the facts were not
generally acknowledged until much later.
</P>
<P>
   In Bloomingdale's as the century began, a man demonstrated the
apparatus for two or three hours every day, until his fingernails
stopped growing, his skin began scaling, the hair on his face and
head fell out and his vision was impaired. Even after the dangers
were evident they were sometimes ignored: as late as the 1950s and
1960s, shoe stores had fluoroscopes where customers could check the
fit and children could play by watching the bones of their toes
wiggle.
</P>
<P>
   Bettyann Holtzmann Kevles, in a thorough study titled ``Naked to
the Bone: Medical Imaging in the 20th Century'' (Rutgers University
Press), writes that early in this century, artists, many of whom
followed the breaking news in science, quickly incorporated the
idea of X-ray vision into their art.
</P>
<P>
   The futurist artist Umberto Boccioni wrote, ``Why should we
continue to create without taking into account our perceptive
powers which can give results analogous to those of X-rays?'' Among
work influenced by X-rays, Ms. Kevles mentions Naum Gabo's glass
and plastic sculpture _ Gabo studied medicine and took a course
with Roentgen _ and Picasso's ``Girl Before a Mirror.''
</P>
<P>
   X-rays themselves, and the more recent MRIs and
computer-assisted tomography (known as CAT or CT scans), have found
their way into art. In 1967, Robert Rauschenberg used a full-scale,
full-body X-ray of himself in ``Booster,'' the largest lithograph
anyone had made to that date.
</P>
<P>
   A slightly later replay of that X-ray is on view in
``Skin/Deep,'' as are imaginative uses of medical imaging
techniques in photographs by Michael Spano, Annie Leibovitz, Helmut
Newton (who draped a Cartier bracelet over an X-ray of a foot in a
high heel), Kunie Sugiura and others. Justine Cooper's art video
made from MRI scans of her body is also at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing the body's interior is in its way as significant today as
it was at the turn of the century. Many contemporary artists
concentrate on the human insides, working with bodily fluids,
displaying their AIDS X-rays, videotaping operations performed on
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Married couples put sonograms of their babies in utero on the
mantelpiece. PET scans (positron emission tomography) reveal what
happens inside the brain when someone thinks, as if to ratify the
early fears that X-rays could read minds.
</P>
<P>
   X-rays, MRIs, CT and PET scans unite several of the major
preoccupations of the day: fear of death (heightened by AIDS and an
aging populace), an accompanying obsession with a healthy body, an
addiction to images, and a voyeuristic drive to reveal everything
and to know everyone's secrets.
</P>
<P>
   There already exist infra-red scopes for night vision and a
camera that can see through clothing. If only we had X-ray vision,
too, we could all be Supermen, and plumb the heart and darkness of
the world.

   FEATURE story &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TAYMOR-TITUS-FILM (Rome) _ The vast white marble piazza before
the Palazzo della Civilta del Lavoro, is a solemn building of
marble arches that looms over EUR, the grandiose exhibition park
Mussolini ordered built in the 1930s to fuse Roman Empire and
Fascist might. And that was what drew the theater director Julie
Taymor to select it as a site for ``Titus,'' her film adaptation of
Shakespeare's tragedy ``Titus Andronicus.'' Whatever its quality is
eventually judged to be, this is no ordinary venture. It is Ms.
Taymor's first feature film, with a starry cast headed by Anthony
Hopkins in the title role, Jessica Lange and Alan Cumming. This is
Ms. Taymor's first major venture since her extraordinary success
last year with Disney's ``Lion King'' _ a show that she transformed
with her direction, design and musical choices from a potentially
potted theatricalization of a cartoon movie into Broadway's biggest
hit. By Alessandra Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-UNDERSTANDING (Undated) _ Present an unfamiliar piece of
music to a randomly chosen audience member, ask an opinion, and I
challenge you to get a simple expository sentence in response. The
body language will be one of retreat; the words will be quick to
equivocate. ``That was interesting,'' or ``I didn't understand it,
but maybe I will next time,'' or ``I should know more about it
before I tell you what I think.'' One longs to hear, ``That was
beautiful,'' or ``I hated it,'' or ``It bored me to death,'' for
this is what those answers really mean. The crucial word here is
``understand,'' for the fear of not understanding is great. Failing
to understand marks the unhappy listener as dense, out of the loop,
ill educated. By Bernard Holland.
</P>
<P>
   FILM AND VIDEO
</P>
<P>
   GEENA-DAVIS-FILMS (Los Angeles) _ The Academy award-winning
actress Geena Davis is back, or at least working at a comeback
after a two-year hiatus and a divorce. And she has made it clear
that she is willing to play just about anything _ except a
weakling. Her new movie ``Stuart Little,'' based on E.B. White's
classic 1945 children's book about a family whose new son turns out
to be a mouse, symbolizes the critical juncture where Ms. Davis,
who is 41, stands. By James Sterngold.
</P>
<P>
   GLEESON-GENERAL-FILM (Dublin, Ireland) _ Brendan Gleeson bears
an uncanny resemblance to Martin Cahill, the maverick Dublin
gangland boss whom he plays in John Boorman's new movie, ``The
General,'' which opened Friday in New York. Yet there was another,
more subtle, reason for casting the burly Irish actor as the
mobster. In order to convey why Dubliners came to admire this
hardened criminal, murdered by the IRA in 1994, Boorman needed a
likable Cahill. And Gleeson is very likable. But he also has what
the veteran director calls ``essential goodness,'' which is why he
almost turned down his biggest movie role to date. By Alan Riding.
</P>
<P>
   TELEVISION
</P>
<P>
   DAVID-KELLEY-TV (Undated) _ Jerry Seinfeld put it as well as
anybody. ``I mean,'' he said of David E. Kelley, ``this guy has
done actual things.'' Kelley may be this decade's dean of the
quality series, but when the Museum of Television and Radio in Los
Angeles honored him and Seinfeld on the same night two months ago,
the speakers seemed to have trouble describing the essence of the
Kelley greatness. Dylan McDermott, of Kelley's ABC law series,
``The Practice,'' used the words ``quirky, idiosyncratic,'' because
somebody had to. Calista Flockhart, of Kelley's Fox law series,
``Ally McBeal,'' went for the sentimental, describing Kelley as one
who ``tells us what it's like to be people.'' By Anita Gates.
</P>
<P>
   ANTIQUES
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-CHU-ART (Paris) _ In the fifth century B.C., Confucius
questioned the practice of burying people alive alongside the dead
in funerary rituals, calling it a waste of human life. But it was
not until 100 years later that the Chu people of Southern China
abandoned human sacrifice, replacing the living in such rituals
with carved and lacquered wooden figures. Chu artists produced
haunting effigies of concubines, slaves, deer and tigers, all
common in the retinues of Chinese rulers during the late Warring
States period (fourth century to third century B.C.) and the Han
Dynasty (206 B.C. to 220 A.D.). A large number of Chu works have
been excavated over the past 20 years, and recently such works have
become more visible in the market. The Chu figures are now both the
subject of scholarly study and are being actively collected by
museums. By Rita Reif.

   WASHINGTON _ Even as the White House scrambles for a deal to
rescue President Clinton, Republican and Democratic senators said
on Tuesday that it was highly unlikely that the president could
avoid a divisive and possibly protracted trial in the Senate if the
House votes this week to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   Some Senate Democrats embraced a proposal put forward on Tuesday
by Bob Dole, the former Senate Republican leader, for the Senate to
halt the process by passing a tough censure measure that the
president would have to sign. White House officials also said they
hoped that Dole's entreaty would provide cover for Republicans who
do not want to go ahead with impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   But as Republicans hurtled toward impeachment, even Democrats
conceded that it was probably too late for senators to try to
broker a deal. Beyond the pace of events, they said that a sense of
duty would ultimately prevail on senators to act as jurors and
weigh the evidence presented by the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is deteriorating rapidly; it is now very likely
a trial is going to be held in the United States Senate for the
removal of Bill Clinton,'' said Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., who
nevertheless welcomed the Dole proposal. ``We do no service to the
country to operate in denial.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who thinks there should be a trial,
said: ``If the House returns articles of impeachment, we're past
the point of no return.'' The Dole proposal, he said, ``is a
sophisticated form of censure and would not be acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., who favors censure, said: ``I
think a trial will start'' if the House votes to impeach the
president. The Senate, he said, has ``a constitutional obligation''
to ``look at the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   For weeks many senators had declined to publicly discuss the
impeachment inquiry, saying they did not seriously believe it would
reach the Senate. But in interviews on Tuesday, several in both
parties said they were stunned by the turn of events in the House
and said they were now preparing for a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton would be the second president in history to face a
Senate trial. The first was President Andrew Johnson, who was
acquitted by one vote in 1868.
</P>
<P>
   Some senators noted, however, that the White House scandal has
been marked by surprising turns, and cautioned that it was not
inconceivable that the dynamic could somehow change after the House
acts _ or if Clinton makes a dramatic appeal to the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, several senators said they had begun reading up on the
history of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before it was kind of theater, it was surreal,'' said Sen.
Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., who has not stated his position on
impeachment. ``Now we're what stands between the president going to
the gallows and being set free. And that's a pretty serious
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who said he, too, does not know how
he would vote on impeachment, said that while ``up until a few days
ago, I didn't think it was a likely scenario,'' he said a trial
would take place ``because you can't ignore constitutionally what
the House has done.''

 &HT;    Reeves bouncing back well, out of ICU
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Falcons coach Dan Reeves was moved from
intensive care to a private room at Piedmont Hospital on Tuesday
afternoon, and his recovery from Monday's quadruple-bypass heart
surgery is going ``beautifully,'' team physician Charlie Harrison
said.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, 54, had been suffering chest pains for several weeks
before mentioning to Harrison after Sunday's game at New Orleans
that they became worse during the game. After an angiogram Monday
morning, he underwent four hours of surgery in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   After coming out of surgery about 3:30 p.m. Monday, Reeves had a
breathing tube inserted in his esophagus. It was removed about 7
p.m. He is not expected to return full-time to the Falcons until
the playoffs. The team has two regular-season games remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything has just gone beautifully,'' Harrison said. ``He
had a good night. His EKG and vital signs are stable, and he was
able to eat breakfast (Tuesday) morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a little bit hoarse, which would inhibit his ability to
converse with officials the way he likes to, but he's doing quite
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves' sore throat, a byproduct of the breathing tube, did not
prevent him from talking. Andrew Bishop, one of the team's doctors,
said the first words out of the coach's mouth about 6:30 a.m.
Tuesday were, ``How's Bob Christian?''
</P>
<P>
   Christian, the Falcons' fullback, was injured during the Saints
game, and at the time Reeves went into surgery, he did not know
that Christian was out for the season with torn knee ligaments.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves also spoke by telephone with interim head coach Rich
Brooks and running backs coach George Sefcik. Brooks and staff
began installing the game plan for Sunday's game against Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually spread my stuff out,'' Brooks said. ``The offense
usually has longer Tuesday, and we (the defensive staff) usually
have longer Wednesdays and Thursdays.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, who will remain in the coaches' box at the Silverdome
Sunday, was involved Tuesday in both offensive and defensive
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only difference is I just confer a little bit more with
(general manager) Harold Richardson and George Sefcik and talk to
trainers to get medical reports,'' said Brooks, who was head coach
of the Rams in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: The Reeves family has asked that, in lieu of flowers,
donations be sent to the Falcons Youth Foundation at One Falcon
Place, Suwanee, Ga. 30024.

 &HT;    Democratic core rallies round the president
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As support for the president eroded on Capitol Hill
Tuesday, core constituencies of the Democratic Party rallied to his
defense outside the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of more than a dozen women's organizations joined
AFL-CIO executive vice president Linda Chavez-Thompson to demand
that Congress censure rather than impeach Clinton over his efforts
to conceal his relationship with former intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impeachment process is neither serious nor fair,''
Chavez-Thompson said. ``It's a partisan political stampede which
promises to trample all of the issues that really matter in the
everyday lives of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   The labor leader said the AFL-CIO has received hundreds of calls
from people volunteering to lobby members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Planned Parenthood and women's groups such as the National
Organization for Women and the Feminist Majority are also
mobilizing their members to lobby Congress with letters, phone
calls, faxes and e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me send out a warning to those who call themselves
moderates,'' said Kim Grandy, NOW's vice president. ``You are in
jeopardy if you vote for impeach- ment.''
</P>
<P>
   But the leaders failed to move Rep. Bob Livingston (R-La.), the
man the GOP has selected to be speaker of the House. Livingston
told them at a meeting following their morning news conference that
he won't retreat from his decision to prevent a vote on censure on
the House floor, Grandy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so dismissive,'' Grandy said. ``I don't know why he met
with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston spokesman Mark Corallo accused the women's leaders of
mischaracterizing the meeting. ``He was very gentlemanly,'' Corallo
said. ``I think they couldn't take the fact that he didn't agree
with them.''
</P>
<P>
   At a separate event to promote a new book, Clinton's Washington
minister also came to the president's defense, saying Congress
should reprimand Clinton but not impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way to deal with something like this, without
discarding a person who really is a very gifted public leader and
who in so many aspects of his life has been morally sensitive and
committed,'' the Rev. J. Philip Wogaman told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also received some unlikely support from supporters of
perennial presidential candidate Lyndon LaRouche. About two dozen
LaRouche supporters picketed outside the Capitol demanding that
Congress not impeach Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a coup to overthrow the United States government and
disenfranchise the American electorate,'' said Angela Vullo of the
Schiller Institute, a LaRouche-affiliated organization.

   CBS Names `Late Late' Host
</P>
<P>
   CBS has announced the starting date for the latest entry into
the late-night competition. It said Tuesday that Craig Kilborn
would take up the host's duties on a revamped ``Late Late Show'' on
March 30.
</P>
<P>
   He will replace Tom Snyder, who will end his version of the
show, with a straight interview format, on March 26. Kilborn will
actually start on a Tuesday because the previous night will be
filled by the final game of the NCAA basketball tournament, which
is expected to extend past 11 p.m., backing up the network's
late-night lineup. CBS did not want Kilborn's first show to be
delayed past its normal 12:35 a.m. starting time.
</P>
<P>
   But the date was chosen in an effort to take advantage of what
CBS hopes will be an unusually large contingent of younger male
viewers, who will be watching the college basketball Final Four on
the network that weekend and seeing a large number of promotional
spots for Kilborn's show. His appeal as host of ``The Daily Show''
on Comedy Central has been skewed toward younger men.
</P>
<P>
   Kilborn will be finishing his stint on ``The Daily Show'' this
week. The show will offer reruns until he is replaced there by Jon
Stewart on Jan. 11. In the meantime, Kilborn will work on
developing his new CBS show.
</P>
<P>
   It is expected that Kilborn and the show's production company,
David Letterman's Worldwide Pants, will fashion the new late-night
show as an hour built around Kilborn's quirky approach to comedy,
with a style designed to separate it from the current
desk-couch-band setup that dominates the late-night shows, from
Letterman's on CBS to Jay Leno's ``Tonight'' show and Conan
O'Brien's ``Late Night'' on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   One big change being planned in the format is to eliminate the
band completely. Kilborn is also expected to have a smaller,
perhaps deskless set, with a modest-sized studio audience.
</P>
<P>
   And as Letterman did when he moved from NBC to CBS, Kilborn will
attempt to bring some of his signature comedy pieces with him,
including a segment called ``Five Questions.''

   Rating the Local News
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom has it that news on local television is
superficial and crime-obsessed: ``If it bleeds it leads,'' the
cliche goes.
</P>
<P>
   But the public doesn't necessarily share that conventional
wisdom, according to a study by researchers at the University of
Connecticut for the Radio and Television News Directors Foundation.
Two-thirds of those surveyed rated the news they got from their
local stations as good (52 percent) or excellent (14 percent), with
24 percent calling it fair and 8 percent poor.
</P>
<P>
   And most (55 percent) said the amount of coverage devoted to
crime was about right.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you stop and think about it, it's not so surprising,'' said
Barbara Cochran, the foundation's president. ``Local news is closer
to people. And you can see that in the survey, because the public
and station news directors are in marked agreement on what stories
they think the public likes to see on local news.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers polled 1,007 randomly chosen American adults, in
October, and 300 news directors, in November. What people said they
most wanted to see jibed with what news directors thought their
viewers most wanted to see: weather reports first and foremost,
followed by (in this order of interest) news about education, local
crime, community happenings, world developments and health and
fitness. Lowest on the list was religion news.
</P>
<P>
   ``This certainly confirms that people do tune in to find out
about local crime and expect that,'' Ms. Cochran said. ``But they
also said they would like to see more coverage of crime prevention
and solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet when asked whether it was important for local television
news divisions to act as watchdogs on local government, only 62
percent of the public said yes, while 92 percent of news directors
said they believed they should have such a role.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hear this in focus groups, too,'' Ms. Cochran said. ``
`Tell us the facts; don't tell us what to think or how to act.' I
think news directors need to do a better job of explaining to the
public what that watchdog role means.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, 66 percent of adults thought journalists should not be
allowed to use hidden cameras or microphones (22 percent of news
directors agreed); 57 percent of adults said if a reporter could
not find a source willing to be named, that story should not be
reported (29 percent of news directors agreed); and 48 percent of
adults said local news goes too far into public figures' private
lives (only 11 percent of news directors agreed).
</P>
<P>
   The survey was part of a larger, two-year Journalism Ethics and
Integrity Project partly underwritten by the Ford Foundation.

   An Animated Murdoch
</P>
<P>
   Does Rupert Murdoch have a sense of humor? Apparently he does,
because he signed on to do a scene with Homer Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   The Fox chairman will appear, both in cartoon form and in voice,
on a Super Bowl edition of ``The Simpsons'' on Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   That is the same night of the premiere of a new animated Fox
series, ``Family Guy,'' directly after its Super Bowl coverage
ends. The game has traditionally provided a huge sample audience
for a new show, and Fox executives believe they have a potential
breakthrough hit with ``Family Guy.''
</P>
<P>
   But animation of the show's other episodes will not be finished
in time to follow up the premiere immediately. So the series will
not be seen again until March.
</P>
<P>
   But as a partner for ``Family Guy'' that night, Fox announced it
would broadcast a special episode of ``The Simpsons.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where Murdoch comes in. The show's writers came up with
an idea that takes Homer to the Super Bowl, where he contrives to
get himself into a luxurious sky box. His party is interrupted,
however, by a ``distinguished-looking older gentleman with an
Australian accent,'' whom Homer calls ``Gramps'' and tries to throw
out of the box.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch lets Homer know exactly who he is: ``The billionaire
tyrant Rupert Murdoch.''
</P>
<P>
   The show's producers said Murdoch readily agreed to take part in
the show and delivered all the takes they asked for.

   An On-Screen Retort
</P>
<P>
   Though he hasn't said anything publicly about the
much-talked-about anorexia rumors surrounding Calista Flockhart,
who plays the painfully thin title character on ``Ally McBeal,''
David E. Kelley, the show's creator, has clearly been listening.
</P>
<P>
   He used this week's episode to have a little fun with the rumors
about Ms. Flockhart, and another of his stars, Lara Flynn Boyle,
who plays the painfully thin Helen Gamble, an assistant district
attorney on Kelley's other series, ``The Practice.'' Ms. Boyle's
name has come up in similar rumors about her eating habits.
</P>
<P>
   She made an unbilled cameo appearance on Monday's ``Ally
McBeal'' with her character accidentally bumping into Ally at an
office Christmas party. The two characters, who apparently don't
like each other, eyeballed each other for a moment before Helen
told Ally she was admiring her outfit.
</P>
<P>
   Then she suggested to Ally: ``Maybe you could eat a cookie.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ally replied: ``Maybe we could share it.''

OWENS CORNING IS SETTLING MOST OF ITS ASBESTOS CASES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the past two decades, as thousands of people have learned
each year that they were ill or dying because of exposure to
asbestos, manufacturers that sold the versatile but deadly mineral
have given up fighting and settled claims with the notable
exception of Owens Corning, the building products company best
known for its pink fiberglass insulation.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, Owens Corning said it was settling 176,000 cases,
nearly 90 percent of those pending, for $1.2 billion. After paying
their lawyers, plaintiffs will pocket an average of $4,600.
</P>
<P>
   The Toledo, Ohio, company said the settlement, with more than 50
law firms, would help it remove investor uncertainty about the
nation's largest maker of building insulation.
</P>
<P>
   The change in policy had no effect on Owens Corning's stock
price, however. It finished Tuesday at $36.0625 share, unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiff lawyers who did not participate in the settlement said
the company faced years of litigation as about 3,000 people a month
develop asbestos-related disease and sue the company, a trend
expected to continue well into the next century even though Owens
Corning last sold its Kaylo pipe insulation in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   By 2030, nearly a century after the first asbestos case was
reported in the United States, about 300,000 people will have died
because of asbestos, said Dr. Philip J. Landrigan of the Mount
Sinai School of Medicine in New York. Landrigan is a leading
authority on asbestos-induced illness.
</P>
<P>
   Owens Corning sold $135 million worth of Kaylo between 1958 and
1972, Glen Hiner, its chief executive, said Tuesday, but will spend
nearly $5 billion on claims before the issue becomes history. He
said the company made perhaps 1 percent of asbestos products over
the years.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiff lawyers said that at construction sites Kaylo was a
major cause of deadly dust that caused mesothelioma, an always
fatal cancer caused by exposure to asbestos; lung cancer, and
asbestosis, a disease that impairs the ability of the lungs to
bring oxygen to the blood stream and expel carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Hennessey, who for 10 years was the editor of Asbestos
Litigation Reporter, an Andrews Publications newsletter in Wayne,
Pa., said the company's refusal to settle was hurting it with
juries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Owens Corning had been notorious for years,'' he said, ``for
maintaining a scorched-earth policy, a general refusal to settle,
and consequently it was going to trial more than any other asbestos
company and we were seeing trial after trial go against the company
and then they would appeal those verdicts.''
</P>
<P>
   Hiner said that was a fair assessment, but noted that ``in
January I brought in a new general counsel and things have
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Maura Abnel, the new general counsel, worked out agreements with
50 law firms to pay claims based on previous awards in each court
jurisdiction and on the record of the law firm in getting money for
clients based on their illness or death. Under the settlement two
people with the same illness from the same work site could get
dramatically different amounts of money if they hired different
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Perry Weitz, of Weitz &AMP; Luxenberg, a Manhattan personal injury
law firm with 10,000 asbestos cases, said he was the first lawyer
Owens Corning approached about a national settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really important to emphasize that this will get the
victims money much sooner, rather than later, and we will use money
that would have gone to litigation to benefit clients,'' Weitz
said. ``Owens Corning now knows what it will owe and the company
can now grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Several plaintiff lawyers who are not participating in the
settlement said that the company made no effort to settle the
strongest cases involving death from mesothelioma.
</P>
<P>
   ``This settlement creates tremendous breathing room for them and
is a tremendous accomplishment and is good for them,'' said Shepard
A. Hoffman, a Baltimore lawyer who has 30 cases of people who died
from or are dying from mesothelioma. ``But it comes at a cost
because people who settle will do so at a discount while their
lawyers will be assured payment, and if you are a plaintiff lawyer
looking at getting, say, $50 million with no more risk it can be
very attractive.''

 By ALFRED PORTABLE

<TEXT>
<P>
   During most of December, my childhood home in Buffalo could have
been beamed to Sicily without a single Sicilian noticing anything
peculiar about it.
</P>
<P>
   The preparations for our Christmas Eve feast, the ravioli my
mother would make and stash in the freezer right after
Thanksgiving, the dandelion greens that my grandfather had
harvested from roadside patches in the fall, and the fig-stuffed
cookies that were stored in tins in the cool hallway would be as
familiar to my Sicilian relatives as the creche, wreaths and
bottomless bowls of nuts and tangerines that were arranged around
our house. Certainly, they would recognize the fish dishes on our
Christmas Eve menu. Ours was a celebration bound by Old World
traditions.
</P>
<P>
   It was the observance of the Cena della Vigilia, the wait for
the miraculous birth of Christ. In the early Christian centuries,
Catholics waited on an empty stomach: Christmas Eve was a day of
fasting, and nothing but water was permitted before holy communion
at midnight Mass. Later, it became a penitential day, meaning that
all foods except meat were allowed, and that's probably when the
fast became a feast of fishes.
</P>
<P>
   By today's standards, and certainly by those I grew up with,
every Christmas Eve dinner of my childhood was indeed a feast.
Everyone in my family remembers special dishes from those meals,
but no one can remember whether there was a set number of dishes,
even though one of the rituals is to eat by number. The number of
dishes is significant, although it can range from three,
representing each of the Wise Men or the Trinity, to as many as 13,
one for each of the apostles plus one for Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the number of dishes at our house was always many.
</P>
<P>
   There was always a shrimp cocktail with a spicy red sauce,
mostly because everyone loved it, and always a dish of cod, the
most traditional of the Christmas fishes. Cod is an ancient animal,
so ancient that I can imagine its being served at the first Cena
della Vigilia.
</P>
<P>
   Often there was salt cod, or baccala, an Italian staple, soaked
for a day or two before Christmas and served with potatoes or with
lots of onions and a very thin tomato sauce, tomato sauce being the
litmus test of a good cook in our family.
</P>
<P>
   A fried dish was always part of the dinner, usually fresh cod,
although sometimes it was a large, whole breaded fish. And there
was always eel, usually smoked (I'm not sure you could find fresh
eel in Buffalo then) and served as a salad.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until I was older that I learned that eel, an element
of pre-Christian cult rituals, was essential to the Italian
Christmas Eve tradition. I don't know how essential the clams that
my father baked with pancetta and bread crumbs were, but I still
make them for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   There is one dish I'll never make, the one my grandmother would
trick the children into eating: pasta with sardines. She would tell
us that if we ate all our pasta, we'd find a surprise, and every
year we dutifully ate the pasta only to find the little flower
painted on the bowl's bottom.
</P>
<P>
   There were so many other dishes, too, like shrimp and clams and
calamari and octopus with tentacles that terrified me. But if I got
through the tentacles, I could have dessert: the coveted Christmas
cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Each of my aunts had her specialty _ crisp anise pizzelles,
biscotti, sesame seed cookies _ and each of us had a favorite. I
could never get enough of my mother's soft, spicy,
crumple-in-your-mouth cocoa balls, rich with raisins and walnuts
and glazed with a thin icing.
</P>
<P>
   My mother never parted with her copy of the recipe, handwritten,
as most of her recipes were, on a dogeared index card, but I was
her kitchen helper for so many years that I can now bake them from
memory. And a few years ago I made a discovery: If you use fine
cocoa, like Valrhona or Callebaut, they turn out even richer and
more chocolaty.
</P>
<P>
   Today, no one in my family celebrates Christmas Eve as
extravagantly as we did when I was young. Even my parents have
streamlined their menu, cutting it down to Champagne, shrimp
cocktail and one fish dish. But because the memories of those
childhood celebrations are such an important and wonderful part of
my life, I try to keep the rituals alive and to pass them on to my
children by making an all-fish meal with dishes inspired by those
my family cherished.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, my wife, Helen, and our daughters, Olympia, 10, and
Victoria, 7, have Christmas Eve dinner together, and it is always
just us around the table. This year's dinner will begin, as all our
Christmas Eve dinners have, with Champagne. (For almost 20 years,
Helen and I have had Champagne on Christmas Eve, dated and
decorated each of the Christmas corks, and turned them into
ornaments that hang on our tree.) And then we'll have shrimp
cocktail, but I'll make a lemony aioli with capers as the dipping
sauce. (I guess I can admit this now: I never really liked the red
cocktail sauce.)
</P>
<P>
   We always have a clam dish, of course, sometimes linguine with
clams, and sometimes steamed clams on thick slices of bread, but
usually its my father's baked clams, as it will be this year.
</P>
<P>
   And there will be eel. I'll make a salad, as my mother did, but
this year it will be warm and reminiscent of both the fresh and
salted cod dishes of my childhood. I'll use smoked eel and serve it
with fingerling potatoes _ the salt cod was often served with
potatoes _ and I'll use my mother's favorite seasonings for fresh
cod: lots and lots of minced garlic and parsley and really good
extra virgin olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   My cod will be quickly seared and set on a ragout of garlicky
cannellini beans and creamy savoy cabbage, humble ingredients from
my childhood that are also foods that I serve regularly at the
restaurant. But because it is Christmas, I'll dress up the dish
with a generous helping of luxurious black truffles.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there will be a risotto with seafood, a rice version of
my family's pasta dish, but this year, along with the clams,
mussels, shrimp and squid, I'll toss in some lobster. I'll use the
shells to make a broth; cooking the rice in a rich seafood broth
really intensifies the flavor of the risotto. And I'll stir the
tender chunks of lobster into the saucepan at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   As always, there will be cookies for dessert: the gingerbread
cookies we make with our daughters, the pizelles that Helen makes
in such outrageous numbers that we give plates of them away to our
neighbors, and the irresistible cocoa cookies of my childhood.
</P>
<P>
   To finish, we'll make a pot of hot chocolate, leave a cup out
for Santa along with a plate of cookies that would make my mother
proud, tuck the girls into bed and do what the grown-ups in my
family used to do: crack walnuts, eat tangerines and wait for St.
Nick. &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1 cup unsweetened cocoa (preferably Valrhona, Callebaut or
Droste)
</P>
<P>
   4{ teaspoons baking powder
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon ground cloves
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1{ cups plump, moist raisins, coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon orange juice
</P>
<P>
   } pound (3 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   1\ cups sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 large eggs, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   1 cup apricot jam
</P>
<P>
   \ cup milk, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   1{ cups lightly toasted walnuts, coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 cup confectioners' sugar
</P>
<P>
   3 teaspoons lemon juice. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. In large mixing bowl, combine flour, cocoa, baking powder,
cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and salt. Whisk to combine, and set aside.
In small bowl, combine raisins and orange juice; reserve.
</P>
<P>
   2. Using heavy-duty mixer with a paddle attachment, or by hand
with a sturdy spoon, beat butter and sugar together until creamy.
Add eggs one at a time, beating on medium speed for 1 minute after
each addition. Beat in vanilla, jam and milk. Set mixer to low, and
gradually add flour mixture, beating only until it is incorporated.
</P>
<P>
   3. Stir nuts and reserved raisins into dough. Cover dough
tightly with plastic wrap, and chill for at least 2 hours and for
as long as 2 days.
</P>
<P>
   4. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Using a tablespoon of dough for
each cookie, roll the dough between your palms to form walnut-size
balls. Place balls on a nonstick or parchment-lined cookie sheet,
1{ inches apart. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until tops look dry;
the tops may crack, which is fine. Transfer cookies to a rack, and
repeat with rest of dough.
</P>
<P>
   5. While cookies are baking, make a glaze: In a small bowl,
combine confectioners' sugar, lemon juice and 3 teaspoons of warm
water. Whisk until smooth. While cookies are still warm from oven,
dip their tops into the glaze, and place them on a rack to cool to
room temperature. The cookies may also be painted with the glaze
using a feather pastry brush.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: about 7 dozen.  &QL;

   6 cod fillets, 6 to 7 ounces each
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons finely minced chives. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. In large saucepan, combine beans, onion, garlic and thyme.
Add enough water to cover beans by 2 inches. Bring to boil, and
then reduce heat to medium-low; simmer beans for 30 minutes. Add
salt and pepper to taste, and continue to simmer until beans are
tender, about 15 minutes more. Set aside 1 cup of the cooking
liquid, and drain the beans. Remove and discard onion, garlic and
thyme. Cover beans, and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   2. Place large pot of lightly salted water over high heat, and
bring to boil. Place bowl of ice water close to stove. Add carrots
to pot, and boil for 2 minutes; remove with slotted spoon, and set
aside. Add cabbage to pot, and boil until barely tender, for 3 to 4
minutes. Drain, and immediately plunge cabbage into ice water. When
cabbage is cool, drain well, and gently squeeze cabbage to remove
excess water.
</P>
<P>
   3. In large saucepan over high heat, bring reserved cooking
liquid to boil. Reduce heat to medium, add cream, and bring mixture
to a simmer. Reduce heat to its lowest setting, and add butter in 4
or 5 additions, whisking until it has emulsified. Season mixture
with salt and pepper to taste, and stir in beans, carrots, cabbage
and black truffle. Keep pan over very low heat for 5 minutes to
warm ragout and allow truffle flavor to infuse mixture.
</P>
<P>
   4. While ragout is warming, prepare cod fillets: Place large
nonstick or well-seasoned saute pan over medium-high heat. Add
canola oil. Season cod fillets on both sides with salt and pepper
to taste. Add to saute pan, and cook until outsides are golden and
centers are opaque, for 3 to 4 minutes a side.
</P>
<P>
   5. To serve, use slotted spoon to transfer some of the ragout to
a warm platter or individual serving plates. Arrange cod fillets on
top of ragout, and spoon over remaining ragout and sauce. Top with
minced chives, and serve immediately.

KRAFT DEAL WITH CONNECTICUT BEST-EVER FOR NFL OWNER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Despite some changes over the weekend that decreased
elements of the deal, the New England Patriots and owner Robert
Kraft are the beneficiaries of the most generous stadium financing
agreement ever offered to an National Football League franchise,
most experts agreed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Even in an era when several mid-sized cities _ including
Nashville, Charlotte, St. Louis and Tampa _ have offered NFL owners
lavish terms to secure the status and allure of bigtime
professional sports for their communities, the deal approved by the
Connecticut General Assembly Tuesday to move the Patriots to
Hartford outranks them all, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ought to recognize it's the worst publicly-financed
stadium deal ever done,'' said Mark Rosentraub, director of the
Center for Urban Policy and the Environment at Indiana University.
``And anyone doing it ought to realize that by doing it they have
succeeded mostly in making one owner very wealthy.''
</P>
<P>
   The provisions that makes the agreement on the $375 million
stadium project so strikingly generous are the state guarantees for
premium seating _ potential costs that are not financed as part of
the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The state has agreed to pay for as much as $13 million in luxury
box fees and club seating tickets annually for at least the first
10 years of the Patriots' lease. That potential exposure was
lowered from $17.5 million over the weekend, in a move that
provided some momentum for the vote Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Of all of the recent stadium deals done in the NFL _ some 14
since 1992 _ two provide a guarantee of revenue from admissions.
</P>
<P>
   But in one of the deals, for the Rams in St. Louis, the
guarantee was financed by a private civic group, not the state,
county and city governments that paid for the $280 million RCA
Dome. And unlike the Patriots' deal, the public St. Louis Regional
Conventions and Sports Complex will garner portions of the revenue
from stadium advertising and concessions.
</P>
<P>
   In the other deal, San Diego agreed to buy unsold tickets for
some regular seats as part of an agreement in to refurbish Qualcomm
Stadium, the home of the NFL's Chargers, in 1995. But those tickets
are all for non-premium seats, and the maximum exposure for the
city is less than $2 million per year.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kraft and his son Jonathan have said, at a legislative
hearing in Hartford last week and elsewhere, that they have done a
poor job of explaining their deal with Connecticut. They say, in
part, that a 10 percent ``tax'' on all tickets is expected to
generate as much as $8 million annually for the state. In a sense,
Kraft said, the team is sharing its revenue stream with its
partner.
</P>
<P>
   But some observers say the tax exists only to provide money for
the state' borrowing costs and doesn't really represent a
willingness on Kraft's part to share revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal opinion is that it is priced that way to raise the
revenue for the 10 percent tax, rather than taxing the admission
price that the market will bear,'' said Dean Bonham, of the Bonham
Group in Denver. ``Especially if you are guaranteed the price of
many of the tickets, why not charge as much as you can?''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Kraft has argued against that, saying that the ticket
prices and luxury box fees were calculated independently of the
agreement to provide the state with 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can only charge what the market will bear,'' Kraft said.
``This isn't 10 percent added on top of what we're charging.''
</P>
<P>
   The resulting $8 million annual payment to Connecticut is more
than some owners are contributing to the cost of their new
stadiums, but far less than some others. Georgia received no
payment from the NFL's Falcons when it built the $214 Georgia Dome,
that opened in 1992. And the Rams put up no money when the state of
Missouri, and the county and city of St. Louis paid for the RCA
Dome.
</P>
<P>
   However, Charlotte's $187 million Ericsson Stadium is financed
entirely by the sale of seat licenses and other private sources. In
Washington, D.C., the NFL's Redskins paid $180 million for the $250
million Jack Kent Cooke Stadium project, with public dollars
covering the remaining $70.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Krafts cite two other expenditures, which they say are
significant financial contributions to the deal: $50 million for
the construction of a hotel near the stadium and in the proposed
Adriaen's Landing development and $20 million for an NFL activities
center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never has an NFL team contributed so significantly to the
redevelopment of a city,'' Robert Kraft said, recently.
</P>
<P>
   But observers point out that the Krafts stand to profit
substantially from the spending which, they said, is more in the
nature of an investment than a payment.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, building a hotel directly connected to a convention
center, near and new NFL stadium, amid a lot of redevelopment and
new activities in a city is tantamount to writing a blank check,''
Bonham said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When all things are considered _ the land being for free, the
facility built for free, the state paying for renovations and
maintenance, the naming rights going to the team, the annual
guarantees, and the obvious potential for revenue from the hotel
and the activities center _ there has never been anything like
this,'' he said. ``There is nothing in the NFL, there is nothing in
professional sports, that compares with this deal.''

YOUNG SCHOLAR TORN BETWEEN WESTERN MONEY, FAMILY DEVOTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Li Wei, an affable college senior, spent sleepless
months this year wrestling with a life-altering decision.
</P>
<P>
   In January, he was offered a glamorous job in the Chinese
headquarters of Procter &AMP; Gamble, with a princely starting salary
of almost $700 a month, a plush apartment and a pension plan. To
recruit him, the Cincinnati-based company flew him first class to
its office in Guangzhou _ his first flight ever _ and put him up at
a five-star hotel.
</P>
<P>
   But in April, Li, 22, a brilliant physics major at Nanjing
University, received another offer _ this one with more traditional
cachet: a coveted place in the Ph.D. program in genetics at the
Chinese Academy of Sciences, where he would share a
concrete-floored dorm room with three other men and receive a $50
living stipend each month. He bought the cheapest train ticket
possible, a hard seat, to travel to Beijing to check it out.
</P>
<P>
   For Li, it seemed a no-brainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I said I would go to P &AMP; G,'' said Li, the younger
son of well-educated urban Chinese parents. ``I was very excited _
it meant a different life.''
</P>
<P>
   But his father, an economist at the provincial Communist Party
school in Nanjing, had other ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought the academy was a great honor, that I should do
something for the country,'' Li recalled in a recent interview.
``And he thinks that studying is the right road and business is
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   And so Li's future became the rope in a nasty tug-of-war, with
modernity, money and capitalism pulling him in one direction _ and
tradition, family and Communist ideology tugging powerfully in the
other. In this fast-changing society, where career choices have
expanded dramatically, a whole generation of Chinese is similarly
torn.
</P>
<P>
   Most classmates said he was crazy not to go corporate _ 1,000
students at his college had applied to Procter &AMP; Gamble and only
eight were accepted. But there was also ``heavy pressure'' from his
parents to take the honorable path.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever his mother, Yao Lijuan, an accountant, called his dorm,
he'd answer, ``Going to P &AMP; G.''
</P>
<P>
   The gulf between old and new viewpoints seemed hopelessly
unbridgeable. And then _ as so often happens in China today _ the
old and the new found a surprising, even surreal, common ground: Li
and his parents agreed to go on an Oprah-like television talk show
called ``Just This Time'' to resolve the impasse.
</P>
<P>
   In early May, Li and his parents sat at separate tables, smiling
nervously, on the stage at Jiangsu studio in Nanjing: Mom in a
conservative red dress; Dad, in a white shirt and red tie; and Li
in a neat polo shirt, looking not unlike a grad student at
Stanford. The young host, Zhang Hongjun, with blow-dried hair and
an announcerly voice, introduced the live audience to Li's dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year before graduation, all students' hearts are filled
with confusion because they are facing so many choices today,''
Zhang began, introducing a slick video that showed Li at college,
the elaborate contract from P &AMP; G, and his simple letter of
acceptance from the academy.
</P>
<P>
   Once the lights came up again, Zhang spent the next half hour
sprinting through the audience, sharing the mike with Li, his
parents, his older brother (a doctoral student in engineering), his
uncle and the dozens of people who felt compelled to give Li
advice. It was clear that Li's conundrum touched a deep chord. When
viewers were told they could call after 9 p.m. to talk to Li, the
station's switchboard was jammed until 2 a.m., prompting the
station to schedule a second show on his decision.
</P>
<P>
   That such debates occurred at all is extraordinary in a country
where just five years ago most students were still being assigned
jobs by the government. But by 1997, when Li started to ponder his
future, students had ``more choice than I ever dreamed I would
have,'' Li said. And so, Li both joined his friends at P &AMP; G's
campus recruiting session and also, at his parents' behest,
prepared for the academy's rigorous entrance exams.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, he said, he was drawn to the corporate job for
its promise of on-the-job training. The high salary was
``seductive'' for a Chinese who had grown up in the more austere
1980s and whose family had often been short of cash despite two
successful parents.
</P>
<P>
   On the show, Zhang asked: ``Do you think your dad is
successful?''
</P>
<P>
   Li Wei: ``In his field he's successful, but not in terms of
economic return.''
</P>
<P>
   Father: ``That's not how I define success.'' (Li Wei shook his
head and smiled; he'd heard this one before.)
</P>
<P>
   Zhang: ``Is that why you don't give him more money?''
</P>
<P>
   Father: ``He doesn't need money.''
</P>
<P>
   Li Wei: ``Dad, come on, everyone needs money!''
</P>
<P>
   Such debates rang through his circle of family and friends for
much of the spring. Each phone call brought another opinion: a
friend reminding him about scientists with Ph.D.'s who could not
find work; one uncle advising him to pursue his studies; another, a
businessman, advising him to go to P &AMP; G; his parents offering to
more than double his monthly stipend at the Academy of Science if
would attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We begged him,'' admitted his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have him get his Ph.D. is my dream,'' said his father, a
gregarious man who oozes pride when he speaks of his son. ``I think
these companies are occupying our market and grabbing our best
personnel. I think he should do something for China, not for
America.''
</P>
<P>
   After Li Wei agreed to go on the show, hundreds of strangers
chimed in.
</P>
<P>
   In the studio audience, a college English major applauded his
courage in favoring P &AMP; G. A young man in a buttoned-down white
shirt said, ``If he wants to go to the company, he should. Why
waste four years?'' (Applause from Li Wei.)
</P>
<P>
   But others in the audience and the vast majority of the callers
took the opposing view. ``For the good of our country's science,
there should be some like you who can bear the simple life,'' an
earnest-looking student said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you want to work for foreigners?'' asked a caller who
said she worked for a Chinese cosmetics company.
</P>
<P>
   Today Li remembers his television experience with a little
shudder. But, he adds, it did help push him toward a decision:
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, Li sat on a lower bunk in the dorm room he
shares with three other students at the Academy of Sciences,
ruminating over the road not taken. Room 510 is a Spartan place,
decorated with a light-blue vinyl-covered wardrobe, a few
bookshelves, a clothesline hung with socks, and four stacked
plastic wash basins.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a baggy green sweater and plastic sandals decorated with
basketballs, Li looks far more relaxed than he did on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very hard choice,'' he said. ``P &AMP; G was such a
different life and coming here was the traditional way.'' He hopes
eventually to study overseas and that there will be even better
jobs awaiting him when he graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, there are moments of regret, like the time last
month when his former classmate _ who took one of those eight jobs
at P &AMP; G _ passed through Beijing on a business trip. She was
staying at one of the city's fanciest hotels, the Great Wall
Sheraton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stayed up all night drinking tea and chatting at the
hotel,'' he said with a wistful look. ``It really made me think.''

RUSSIAN PLAN TO EXTEND DEBT ANGERS LENDERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov approved a plan Tuesday
to restructure nearly $14 billion in defaulted Russian treasury
bonds, but the move quickly drew criticism from foreign creditors,
who complained that they had not been consulted about the details
and that Russia was forcing a bad deal upon them.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations over Russian treasury debt have been
overshadowed in recent months by President Boris Yeltsin's ill
health, food shortages and back wages. The debt talks, however, are
significant. At stake is Russia's credibility with foreign lenders
and its long-term access to the financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, the talks have not gone smoothly. Western bankers
say the plan outlined Tuesday is no better _ and perhaps a bit
worse _ than the position Moscow took in August shortly after the
ruble collapsed and Russia defaulted on its domestic debt .
</P>
<P>
   The Russians' approach to the negotiations has aroused ire.
Credit Suisse First Boston, a member of the 19-bank committee that
represents foreign holders of the treasury bonds, warned Moscow
last week not to impose its position by fiat. ``Russia will
aggravate its financial isolation if it unilaterally imposes unfair
restructuring terms on foreign investors,'' Credit Suisse said
then.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials contend that they had no choice but to press
ahead. Deputy Finance Minister Oleg Vyugin said in an interview
that the Russian government had to act now to be able to use funds
set aside in the 1998 budget for the debt restructuring plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're not able to do it this year, our 1998 allocation
would have been liquidated,'' he said, adding that creditors had no
basis to complain since the parameters of the deal had been known
for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   In approving the plan Tuesday, Primakov left Western creditors
in the dark over key details. Russia plans to redeem only 10
percent of its treasury bills for cash in the form of rubles, and
the provisions for converting the rubles to dollars remain unclear.
</P>
<P>
   An additional 20 percent of the bills will be exchanged for
Russian zero-coupon bonds. Western creditors have wanted to know if
they could use these bonds to pay taxes or buy state property in
privatization auctions. That, too, remains somewhat murky, although
Russian officials said Tuesday night that they could be used to pay
tax arrears.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 70 percent is to be exchanged for four- to
five-year bonds. The interest rate on the bonds will be 30 percent
the first year and then decline gradually to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The government says the 30 percent interest rate is based on the
inflation projection for 1999. But many economists expect Russian
inflation next year to exceed 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, some creditors complain that the Russian plan does
not offer investors any improvement in the terms of the
restructuring deal, should the economy unexpectedly begin to
recover.
</P>
<P>
   The origins of Tuesday's decision were laid out several years
ago, when Russia began to finance an enormous budget deficit by
selling treasury securities. Economists say the decision to issue
the treasury bills was sensible enough, but that Russia carried it
to an extreme, using it as a crutch to make up for failure to
collect tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Foreigners and Russian banks initially profited from the high
interest rates on the bills. But they were caught short this summer
when the ruble plunged, and Yeltsin's government defaulted on debt.
</P>
<P>
   The government later promised to restructure 281 billion rubles
($13.9 billion) in treasury debt, and the negotiations with Western
creditors were begun.
</P>
<P>
   While Primakov had nothing to say about his decision Tuesday
night, finance ministry officials promised a fuller explanation
this week when they go to London to meet with Western bankers.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not known if the Russian officials plan to dictate
additional terms, negotiate or simply promise that more details
will be forthcoming at a later date.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are separate issues connected with the repatriation of
foreign currency and with the status of investment securities,''
Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said last week. ``These issues
are important, but from our point of view they can be discussed and
resolved.''

PINOCHET LAWYERS, IN APPEAL, CHALLENGE LAW LORD'S IMPARTIALITY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Lawyers told a House of Lords hearing on Tuesday that
one of the Law Lords who ruled against Gen. Augusto Pinochet had a
concealed bias against the former Chilean dictator and that the
verdict keeping him from returning home should be set aside.
</P>
<P>
   In the first formal challenge ever to a decision of the Law
Lords, England's highest court, the lawyers said Lord Justice
Leonard Hoffmann, who cast the decisive vote against Pinochet,
erred in not alerting the court to his links to Amnesty
International.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the Lords agreed to accept the request for a
review is seen as a reflection of the seriousness with which the
question is being treated. Lord Browne-Wilkinson, head of the Law
Lords, said he would summon a new panel of judges to reconsider the
case if the appeal succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare extension of privilege, Amnesty was permitted to
present its argument against Pinochet to the five-man tribunal that
decided, 3-2, on Nov. 25 that the general did not enjoy immunity
from arrest in England. Because of that ruling, the general will
have to remain in England for what might be more than a year as a
Spanish petition to extradite him to Madrid to face charges of
crimes against humanity goes forward.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffmann, it has emerged, is a director and former chairman of a
charity that raises money for Amnesty. His wife, Gillian, has been
an administrative assistant in the London-based human rights
group's press and publications division since 1977.
</P>
<P>
   His failure to declare that association, aside from provoking
Tuesday's request for an appeal, has aroused concern in the British
legal establishment, which regards Hoffmann as one of its most
capable and learned members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three weeks ago, the case of Gen. Pinochet propelled the
British judiciary to the pinnacle of global admiration,'' Hugo
Young, a columnist for The Guardian, wrote Tuesday, reflecting a
widely held view among lawyers here. ``Through the folly of a
single judge, the Law Lords, from being the heroes, may soon become
the villains.''
</P>
<P>
   As two days of hearings opened Tuesday, the task of a panel of
five Law Lords, separate from the five who ruled last month, was to
determine whether the relationship between Hoffmann and Amnesty
International was ``so clear and obvious'' that there was a ``real
danger'' that he could have been even unconsciously influenced.
</P>
<P>
   Clare Montgomery, Pinochet's lead lawyer, noted that it was a
judge's duty to reveal any links of kinship, friendship, employment
or financial relations with any parties in a case.
</P>
<P>
   She argued that Amnesty published a report in 1993 with
Hoffmann's knowledge ``which was highly critical of Senator
Pinochet and the failure to prosecute anyone in connection with his
period of rule.'' The group's purpose, she said, was to secure the
abolition of ``torture, extrajudicial execution and
disappearance,'' the very crimes Pinochet, who is a
senator-for-life in Chile, was accused of in the hearing before the
Lords about whether he was entitled to immunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The links we suggest are so great and so many that any
reasonable person looking at this would say we have a reasonable
apprehension that there may be bias,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that Hoffmann had been a particularly ``active and
hostile interrogator'' of counsel for Pinochet during the six days
of hearings in November.

 &HT;    Residents line streets to say goodbye to Chiles
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CENTURY, Fla. _ Stopping for a moment from the grimy work of
road building, they put down their shovels, removed their hard hats
and formed a line of respect for the passing funeral procession of
Gov. Lawton Chiles.
</P>
<P>
   One man, alone on the side of the road, dropped to his knee and
made a sign of the cross. A high school honor guard dipped the
state flag as the 20-car motorcade went by. A little child held a
sign saying, ``thanks for walking into our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Caps over their hearts, small American flags in their hands,
waving signs promising never to forget him, Florida's rural
community lined 200 miles of Highways 4 and 90 Tuesday to say
goodbye to Gov. Lawton Chiles.
</P>
<P>
   Here more than anywhere else in the state, among the rolling
hills, deep forests and rural towns of the Panhandle, Chiles felt
most connected to the state he loved. And it was here where he
began his 1,033 mile walk across the state 28 years ago to win a
seat in the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Coming back to where it all began, the flag draped, plain,
unvarnished pine coffin of Florida's 41st governor, arrived in
Century just as the sun was rising on a brisk morning with
temperatures in the 40s. Slowly the residents of this town on the
Alabama border began lining the road waiting for the funeral
procession to begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he came here to start that walk of his it was something
we'd never seen before,'' said Bert Carrilla, 57, as he stood in a
parking lot watching the funeral procession form in front of the
Post Office. ``We just didn't know what to make of it. But he sure
surprised a lot folks.''
</P>
<P>
   With two Florida Highway Patrol cars leading the way, the 1999
black Lincoln hearse pulled away. Chiles sons, Ed and Bud, were in
the car behind the hearse. His daughters, Tandy and Rhea stayed at
the governor's mansion in Tallahassee with their mother Rhea who
was married to Chiles for 48 years. They would join the procession
in its final miles to the Old Capitol where Chiles will lie in
state until his funeral this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   In his diary at the time, Chiles would remember the start of his
walk this way: ``The first fellow that I saw I had to lure down off
a power pole. He kept trying to get a word in and I kept talking to
him about my running for the United States Senate and finally he
got an opportunity to break in and tell me he was from Alabama. I
just told him I sure hoped he had some Florida friends to pass the
word to.''
</P>
<P>
   From Century, Chiles walked through towns with picturesque names
like Jay, Munson, Mossyhead, Ponce de Leon, Bonifay, Chipley,
Marianna, Mt. Pleasant and Qunicy. Along the way he made memories
for himself and the people who lined the roads Tuesday to honor
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came right by my house with his coat over his shoulder,''
said Edsel Brooks, 74, of Ponce de Leon, a two-store, one gas
station town. ``I thought he was a real common person. I really
liked him and I have voted for him every time since. I'm a
Democrat, full blooded and he kept the faith with the people.''
</P>
<P>
   As the funeral procession entered a new county, local sheriff's
deputies would provide escorts. Other deputies and police officers,
blocking intersections, stood with stiff white gloved salutes. A
woman in Munson held a sign saying, ``Now you walk beside God. Your
memory will be with our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Local ambulances and fire trucks parked on the side of the road,
lights flashing and crews standing at attention. Cars along the
road coming in the opposite direction would pull over and stop out
of respect. Men and women cried.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a man who was connected to the people,'' said Robert
Hill of Crestview. ``He was a man of the people and I'm afraid he
may be the last one.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking off his cap as the hearse went by, Ray Fox, 68, said he
thought Chiles was an amazing man. ``He didn't just walk. He
stopped and he talked to people and he listened. I didn't agree
with him all the time but I knew he cared about doing the right
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   One man wore a coonskin cap. Another wore a coonskin vest.
``Walkin'' Lawton in his final 1994 campaign for governor had
dubbed himself the ``he-coon,'' and his followers found it
endearing. In Cottondale, the sign said, ``Gov. Chiles. Working men
and working women will miss you.''
</P>
<P>
   During his nearly eight years as governor, he died just 23 days
from leaving office, Chiles worked to improve health care and
education for children. Along the 200 mile procession, hundreds of
school children lined the road in silent homage. Teachers whispered
prayers. One child held a sign that said, ``Sleep in heavenly
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Approaching the state Capitol, the procession went to the
governor's mansion where the First Lady and Chiles daughters had a
few private moments before beginning the final journey to the Old
Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Two blocks from the Capitol, the procession stopped and Chiles
four children and 10 grandchildren got out of their cars to walk
behind the hearse. The grieving First Lady remained in the car.
Then, the hundreds of people lining the procession route grew
still. The only sound the chatter of television news helicopters
hovering overhead.
</P>
<P>
   As the hearse pulled into the plaza between the old and new
Capitols, state employees, lobbyists and average Floridians watched
as an Army honor guard removed the pine coffin from the hearse and
at 2:53 p.m., more than six hours after leaving Century, carried it
up the Old Capitol steps into the rotunda.
</P>
<P>
   Three decades ago, after ending his now famous walk in Key
Largo, Chiles penned his last diary entry: ``Well it's over!
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times when I dreamed I was an old man and I was
still walking, like maybe this was going to go on forever. But
surprisingly, the several days since Miami went extra fast and when
the finish line slipped up on me, I wasn't really ready. I
certainly faced the end of the road with mixed emotions.''

INSURANCE POINT SYSTEM UNCHANGED AFTER REVIEW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Insurance Commissioner Linda Ruthardt Tuesday rejected
bids to change the way the state rewards good drivers and punishes
bad ones, while reversing herself and going along with an industry
proposal that would treat drivers from out of state more toughly.
</P>
<P>
   Ruthardt was supposed to issue her final decision on 1999 auto
insurance rates Tuesday, but that was delayed indefinitely.
Instead, she issued a partial ruling on three proposed changes to
the state's point system, a sore spot for many motorists.
</P>
<P>
   Her decisions left the system pretty much intact. She rejected a
proposal that had backing from the auto insurance industry and
Beacon Hill to provide some relief for drivers involved in minor
fender-benders.
</P>
<P>
   She also rejected a separate proposal from a watchdog group
within her own agency to increase the number of points assessed for
violations but remove them from a driver's record faster. The
proposal would have allowed penalized drivers to recover faster to
take advantage of discounts available to good drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance industry had suggested increasing the lower
threshold for a minor accident from $500 to $750 to keep pace with
inflation. Many motorists have complained that even a minor
fender-bender exceeds $500 and bumps up their driver step ranking.
</P>
<P>
   Each increase in the ranking translates into a 6 to 7 percent
price increase on most coverages. And the loss of the best Step 9
ranking means the loss of good-driver discounts, which are granted
at the discretion of insurance companies and have cut driver
premiums anywhere from 10 to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ruthardt said she didn't want to raise the threshold to $750
because it would exempt about 15 percent of all accidents from
surcharge points. She said the surcharges from those accidents help
pay for the credits that reward good drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Ruthardt instead suggested drivers raise their deductibles, a
move that would reduce their premiums and limit exposure to points
since damage claims for point purposes are based on the amount paid
out by the insurer after a deductible is applied.
</P>
<P>
   Ruthardt endorsed the premise of removing points from a driver's
record faster, but said the plan, proposed by the State Rating
Bureau, needed refinement.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Ruthardt flip-flopped on how drivers moving into
Massachusetts should be treated. Earlier this year she endorsed the
current policy of allowing out-of-state drivers to receive a Step 9
ranking if they sign a statement saying their driving record had
been clean for six years.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers, led by Trust Insurance of Taunton, said drivers from
several foreign countries were obtaining Step 9 rankings knowing no
one would check. Immigrants from Russia and Southeast Asia were
particularly suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Trust sued Ruthardt in August. Noting the overall point system
is revenue neutral, the company argued that good drivers were
receiving smaller credits on their premiums because foreign drivers
were lying about their driving histories and improperly being
lumped in with them.
</P>
<P>
   Under Tuesday's ruling, Ruthardt said drivers from out-of-state
will automatically start out at a neutral Step 15 ranking unless
they can provide documentation of a clean driving record or their
insurer can verify that record independently.

NATO PLAN FORCES IRELAND TO RECONSIDER NEUTRALITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ The government is moving cautiously but
unmistakably toward a relaxation of Ireland's bedrock national
policy: the military neutrality it has proudly maintained since
gaining independence from Britain 76 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The change is being pressed by Foreign Minister David Andrews,
whose governing political party, Fianna Fail (Warriors of Destiny),
has always denounced any move away from strict neutrality as
disloyal to Ireland, if not treasonous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a hugely emotional issue,'' said Fergus Finlay, a
political consultant and former senior official in the Foreign
Affairs Department. ``For neutrality, read `independence.' For an
awful lot of people neutrality is the cornerstone of our foreign
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Andrews, in radio and television interviews and newspaper
articles, is arguing that Ireland's neutrality should be
reconsidered to permit the country to join the American-sponsored
Partnership for Peace, a group of nations that do not belong to
NATO but have agreed to coordinate military policies with it.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews said that the government would decide on the issue next
year and that the decision could lead to a referendum on
neutrality.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials and diplomats say the government will try to
avoid a referendum by arguing that one is needed only if Ireland's
neutrality is threatened, and that the association with NATO is not
such a threat.
</P>
<P>
   The shift away from strict neutrality has been urged on Ireland
for several years by the United States and by Ireland's European
neighbors. In 1994 the U.S. ambassador to NATO, Robert Hunter,
visited Dublin to urge top Irish officials to join the NATO
program, which falls short of full membership.
</P>
<P>
   When the new ambassador, Michael Sullivan, arrives in Dublin in
January, he is expected to restate the White House view that
Ireland should join the partnership. It is not, officials say, that
the 12,000-strong Irish Army would play a major role in a big
European war. Its role would continue to be as a peacekeeper, like
the force of 700 Irish troops now in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sense, American and European diplomats say, Ireland
owes allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   After remaining neutral in World War II, Ireland received the
protection of the U.S. nuclear umbrella during the Cold War. At the
same time, it received about $30 billion in development aid from
the European Union. While 40,000 Irish volunteers fought in the
British Army in World War II, many Irish men and women recall, some
with shame, that on the death of Hitler in 1945 Prime Minister
Eamon de Valera signed a condolence book at the German Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   He later maintained that at the time, unlike other European
leaders, he did not know of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Neutrality has had a deep impact on modern Ireland. De Valera's
decision to keep Ireland neutral, which enraged Winston Churchill,
was based, historians say, on a fear that there would be public
disorder, if not civil war, if Irish troops were ordered to fight
with those of Britain, the despised colonial power in Ireland until
1922.
</P>
<P>
   Some historians say that because Northern Ireland, as a British
province, sent tens of thousands of troops to the war, a result was
a tightening of the political union between the
Protestant-dominated North and the London government. This, in
turn, made it politically difficult for London to agree to talks
giving the overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Irish Republic more
influence in Northern affairs. The new Northern Ireland peace
agreement approved in the spring tries to solve that problem.
</P>
<P>
   Enemies of any relaxation of neutrality include fringe
nationalists who have argued that the partnership would lead to
British soldiers ordering Irish troops in battle, or even in
barracks in Ireland. Other opponents include the Green Party, which
delights in pointing out that the Unites States has not paid its
full U.N. dues and that this slows down payments to the Irish Army
for its service in Lebanon. Officials acknowledge that the army
makes a profit from peacekeeping. Some 40 Irish soldiers are
expected to go to Kosovo as part of a peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people would see the partnership as a steppingstone to
NATO,'' Finlay said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews wrote in The Irish Times that ``as a voluntary,
nonbinding security framework based on cooperation'' the
partnership has been joined by ``all the other European neutral
nations, Austria, Finland, Sweden and Switzerland. It does not
entail membership of any alliance,'' he added. ``and since a
country which goes to such enormous lengths to defend its
neutrality, such as Switzerland, has no difficulty participating, I
do not believe that the case against our participation on these
grounds is persuasive.''

 &HT;    Nine Republican mavericks are veterans of tough decisions
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Tom Campbell (R-Calif.) reflected Tuesday on
the toughest votes of his House career as he declared he would vote
to impeach President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the Persian Gulf War vote in 1991, Campbell cited a
1997 decision ``to vote against my party's nominee for speaker.''
</P>
<P>
   The nominee was Newt Gingrich, and Campbell was one of nine
Republicans who withstood pressure and, in some cases, ostracism,
to withhold their vote for Gingrich during an ethics investigation
that led to Gingrich's reprimand by the House and a $300,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell is one of several lawmakers from that group of mainly
moderate Republicans who, in a reprise of two years ago, have
agonized over the impeachment vote.
</P>
<P>
   Another of the nine Republicans, Rep. Michael Forbes of New
York, also announced his support for impeachment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has recounted cold shoulders and withdrawn invitations
after he became the first Republican to call publicly for Gingrich
to step down as speaker two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's decision to leave office after this year's elections
has led to a rapid rise for Forbes in Republican ranks.
</P>
<P>
   An ally of Rep. Robert Livingston (R-La.), Forbes has been
tapped to be an assistant to the incoming speaker.
</P>
<P>
   He said his decision on impeachment had nothing to do with his
rehabilitation or any pressure from Republican leaders.
``Absolutely not,'' Forbes said at a Capitol news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Both Campbell and Forbes eventually supported Iowa Republican
Rep. Jim Leach for speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Leach, the chairman of the House Banking Committee, also did not
vote for Gingrich. With a district that tilts Democratic and
handily voted for Clinton in 1996, Leach remains uncommitted on
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Two Washington area lawmakers voted ``present'' in the speaker's
election two years ago. One, Rep. Frank Wolf of Virginia, intends
to vote for Clinton's impeachment. The other, Rep. Connie Morella
of Maryland, has not stated her position.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the nine are leaving Congress at the end of the year.
Rep. Linda Smith of Washington and Rep. Mark Neumann of Wisconsin
lost races for the U.S. Senate in their respective states. Both
have said they intend to vote against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Hostettler of Indiana also is undecided, but both pro-
and anti-impeachment forces count him as a vote for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Scott Klug of Wisconsin is retiring after four terms in the
House, and a Democrat won his seat in November. Klug also is
undecided.

 &HT;    Lawton Chiles paid tribute to `angel' Rhea
 &HT;    By Paul Reid
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ They're saying Lawton Chiles left behind
a government in good order, left his mark on education, left
tobacco in ashes. They're saying he left a legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Chiles would relish the accolades.
</P>
<P>
   But he left something else behind, something that occupied a
far, far greater place in his heart than all the laurels of
political life. He left behind his family.
</P>
<P>
   They have just memories now _ memories and letters and
presidential condolences and fading photos. Memories and an empty
place at the table and old gifts that will elicit with a look or
touch more memories of a husband and father.
</P>
<P>
   This was _ is _ a family in the dictionary sense, a social unit
bound by ancestry, marriage, children and the children's children,
united by common interests, strengthened by healthy conflict,
secure in its love.
</P>
<P>
   Lawton Chiles was a fourth-generation Floridian, which is three
more than most Floridians his age. One of his great-grandfathers
was a field surgeon for the Confederate army, another a
circuit-riding preacher in North Florida. Chiles family roots reach
deep into Florida soil. His father, a railroad man, died of heart
disease at age 59. Lawton Chiles' death was foretold in the genes.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-eight years ago, Chiles married Rhea Grafton,
granddaughter of Florida pioneers. They had met at the University
of Florida, settled in Lakeland. Rhea dropped out of college, where
she had been studying art, to help Chiles get his law practice off
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The role of a '50s wife was to help her husband. Rhea embraced
that role. In 1958, when Chiles ran for the state legislature, Rhea
told their three children: ``This is Daddy's time, we're going to
help him. Your time will come.''
</P>
<P>
   Years later, Rhea went back to UF to finish her art studies. Her
time had come. She has since backed galleries from Florida to New
York and Washington. Art, its perspective and transcendence offered
Rhea Chiles the outlet she needed to express herself while she and
her family were living in the political universe of her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Her selflessness and artistic leanings are both evident in 700
North Adams Street, the coffee-table book she wrote about the
history of the governor's mansion in Tallahassee. It is a
beautifully crafted book. And Rhea never succumbs to any temptation
to inflate her role as the latest occupant of that house. She
writes of her tenure as first lady in a distant third-person voice.
</P>
<P>
   Art was her counterweight _ just as she was Lawton's.
</P>
<P>
   When his official portrait was unveiled last week in the
governor's mansion, Chiles gave a speech that included the usual
political acknowledgements. Then he veered into a tribute to Rhea,
his ``angel.'' It was a warm speech, the pace was perfect, the
language silken. The speaker, clearly, was a man in love.
</P>
<P>
   And the children's time did, indeed, come. Tandy, 46; Bud, 45;
Ed, 43, and Rhea, 32, sculpted independent lives of their own
creation, lives surely influenced by the career choices of their
parents, but distinct, unique.
</P>
<P>
   Rhea, the youngest and her mother's namesake, was adopted. She
lives now in Tampa and has three children of her own. She does not
lead a political life, but she has made clear that her views on
abortion are opposite those of her father. Still, whereas Ronald
Reagan's daughter, Patti Davis, aired her family and political
laundry on the same line, Rhea Chiles MacKinnon separates the two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am my father's daughter, and I love him,'' she said during
the abortion debate. In the Chiles' household, as in Chiles'
political career, honest disagreement never got personal, was never
exploited.
</P>
<P>
   Lawton ``Bud'' Chiles III has taken the most political heat over
the years. Like many sons of politicians, Bud chose a career close
to politics: public relations. As a lobbyist for Citicorp from 1988
to 1990, and TGV, a high-speed rail company, Bud left himself and
his father open to political attack. But the senior Lawton never
apologized for or tried to distance himself from Bud. Any mud
thrown their way slid down the wall without sticking.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Bud, his wife and three children moved to New York,
where he is chairman of Hope For Kids, a national foundation
dedicated to education and health care. He is still an investor in
the Governor's Inn, a small hotel near the state Ccapitol in
Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Chiles operates the Sandbar restaurant on Anna Maria Island
in Manatee County. He helped his father campaign, spending time at
the governor's mansion when Bill Clinton was a guest. He lobbied as
an unpaid volunteer for tax increases his father proposed and made
one unsuccessful foray into elective politics. He lost a state
Senate race in 1990 and says he's not going to run again. His
father never lost a race. Ed has two children.
</P>
<P>
   Tandy Chiles Barrett, the oldest child, may have had the most
spiritual relationship with her father. She is legally blind. He
was known for his ability to see, take aim and bring down game,
literally and in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Tandy's experiences forced Lawton Chiles to see the world
differently, especially the world of education. He said often that
Tandy guided him to a greater, consuming interest in children's
health and education issues.
</P>
<P>
   Tandy has two children, Tandy and Joe, and lives in Winter Park.
``Giving daughters our names is something we do in this family,''
she says. ``It's a way of showing respect for who we are and where
we came from.''
</P>
<P>
   She clearly has her father's political instincts. Soon after the
state won an $11 billion settlement against Big Tobacco in 1997,
Tandy organized the photo-op that brought the suit into national
perspective. She bused dozens of schoolchildren to a Joe Camel
billboard near Orlando. Her father appeared on the scene and led
the children in a chorus of ``Goodbye, Joe,'' as cameras rolled.
The image of children waving bye-bye to the icon of the tobacco
industry served to connect the lawsuit to families on terms
understood by all.
</P>
<P>
   The family will surely pass these stories on to grandchildren,
tales of insight, strength, political savvy, just as the Chiles'
family Bible has been passed down now for five generations.
</P>
<P>
   The L.L. Bean boots that Chiles wore during his first campaign
will become part of public legend, along with our image of the
he-coon bringing down his opponents with one well-placed verbal
shot.
</P>
<P>
   We'll have our memories of Chiles, the public man, but his
family will have something more. They'll have the private memories,
to be sure, will have known the man who walked in those boots.
</P>
<P>
   But they will have this: He is part of them. They completed him.
</P>
<P>
   Chiles' wife spurred the walk
</P>
<P>
   Rhea Chiles called herself her husband's ``corporate memory.''
During the 1990 race she accompanied him on campaign stops, often
taking notes and asking questions as they met with community
groups. Throughout his tenure as governor, Chiles would often
bounce ideas off her and she would help him gauge which direction
he needed to go.
</P>
<P>
   Chiles often credited Rhea with suggesting he walk the state to
help get his name out in his underdog race for the U.S. Senate in
1970. But while the gimmick has now become legendary, there were
moments when Rhea Chiles wondered if Lawton, then a little-known
state senator from Lakeland, would ever get the name recognition
they needed to be competitive.
</P>
<P>
   She recalled recently how she and a handful of supporters would
follow Chiles in a motor home as he walked his route. To help
spread his name, the vehicle displayed a large sign that read:
Camper of ``Walkin' Lawton'' Chiles. Early on the journey, when the
group stopped for refreshments in one small Panhandle town, a local
woman approached Rhea and asked: ``Hello, are you Mrs. Camper?''
``Yikes,'' Rhea said she thought. ``Mission Control, we have a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   As a U.S. senator, Chiles was a frequent supporter of children's
issues but he credits his greater understanding of the issue to the
birth of his son Bud's first child, Lawton IV, who was born
prematurely, weighing 1 pound, 3 ounces. The only permanent damage
Lawton IV, now 17, suffers is some eye damage but the experience
brought his grandfather to chair the National Commission on Infant
Mortality and sparked his interest in the Healthy Mothers/Healthy
Babies movement.

CITIGROUP TO CUT WORK FORCE BY 10,400 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER G. GOSSELIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Citigroup Inc., the newly created _ and troubled _
financial giant, said Tuesday that it will cut its work &UR;  &LR; force by
10,400 in a bid to boost profits.
</P>
<P>
   The firm, formed earlier this year through the merger of
Citicorp and Traveler's Group Inc., will take a $900 million charge
to pay for the 6 percent staff cut. The company is scrambling to
make good on forecasts of its co-chairmen Sanford Weill and John
Reed to boost profits of the combined operation by $1 billion
within two years.
</P>
<P>
   The cutbacks are likely to fall particularly hard on New York,
where Citicorp and Travelers are headquartered. But analysts said
the city is better able to absorb the losses than at any time in
recent years because of a recent burst in new job creation.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup shares jumped 2 11/16, or 5.8 percent, to 48 3/4 on
news of the cutbacks, a welcome reversal from the long slide the
stock has suffered since announcement of the merger last April.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup executives said in September that they were
considering cuts of 8,000 jobs, but apparently concluded that
deeper cuts were needed. About 35 percent of the cuts will be from
the US work force with the rest overseas. The company declined to
provided details of the cuts Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   When the merger was unveiled, Weill and Reed said they believed
they could increase revenues by selling Traveler's insurance and
brokerage services from Traveler's Salomon Smith Barney subsidy to
Citicorp customers.
</P>
<P>
   But trading losses following Russia's August default and
devaluation and internicine warfare between executives of the
merging companies have forced the combined company to focus on
cost-cutting rather than revenue-boosting as a means of raising
profits.
</P>
<P>
   The company ousted James Dimon, the president of the Salomon
Smith Barney unit and a man who was initialy touted as a likely
successor to Weill and Reed, in the wake of the trading losses,
which totalled more than $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup officials said that $525 million of the savings they
are seeking will come from the firm's consumer businesses like
retail banking and insurance, much of it through the merger of back
office functions like telephone service centers. They said $350
million in savings will come from corporate businesses like
emerging markets and investment banking, and an additional $15
million will come from asset management.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At last year's American College of Rheumatology
conference, Anergen Inc. reported what it described as promising
results in early tests of its new treatment for rheumatoid
arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   But by this year's conference, held last month, Anergen had
suspended work on the drug and dismissed 65 percent of its
employees because it had run out of money. On Monday, the company,
based in Redwood City, Calif., managed to keep some of its research
alive by agreeing to be acquired by the Corixa Corp., a Seattle
biotechnology company, for $8.5 million in stock.
</P>
<P>
   The biotechnology industry is facing a financial reckoning.
Investors, disappointed by the financial returns the industry has
provided so far, are growing more reluctant to provide the huge
amounts of money young companies need to develop, test and sell new
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The result, analysts and executives say, is that many small
biotechnology companies are cutting back on research. Some are
falling by the wayside or being acquired by bigger companies. And
many others are giving up ambitions of becoming full-fledged
pharmaceutical companies and instead becoming, in effect,
subcontractors to the big drug companies.
</P>
<P>
   Some executives warn that the lack of capital could also slow
medical innovation because the small biotechnology companies have
often been pioneers, playing a crucial role in quickly moving
scientific discoveries from university laboratories to the
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is too early to say what the impact will be,
biotechnology companies need to spend heavily in their efforts to
develop drugs and diagnostic tests for cancer, AIDS, Alzheimer's
disease and a wide range of other conditions, as well as to develop
basic drug discovery techniques like gene-hunting and chemical
screening.
</P>
<P>
   The Immunex Corp. of Seattle struggled with losses for 17 years
and spent hundreds of millions of dollars on research and
development before finally introducing an important new drug for
rheumatoid arthritis last month. But biotechnology companies just
starting out might not get the same chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it means, unfortunately _ even brutally _ in some cases,
is that promising areas of research will not be pursued,'' said
Carl Feldbaum, president of the Biotechnology Industry
Organization, a trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Some biotechnology industry executives, however, say the
elimination of weaker companies will be healthy, freeing money for
more deserving projects. There are simply too many biotechnology
companies, they say, more than 300 publicly traded ones and about
1,000 private ones.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some experts say, medical innovation will continue but
more of the work will shift to academic laboratories and big drug
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has vowed to double the annual budget of the National
Institutes of Health in the next five years from last year's $13.6
billion. This year's budget is already up to $15.6 billion. And big
pharmaceutical companies, which at first largely ignored
biotechnology, have now adopted its techniques, which involve using
genetic engineering, genetics and other advanced insights into how
cells operate.
</P>
<P>
   Still, small biotechnology companies, like their counterparts in
electronics and computers, can often move faster and more
efficiently into new scientific areas than can big companies.
</P>
<P>
   The biotechnology industry has seen such hard times before, most
recently from 1992 to 1994. Some executives and analysts think this
is just another cyclical downturn, tied to the overall volatility
in the stock market. Indeed, biotechnology stocks have rallied with
the rest of the market in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard of gloom and doom already three or four times,''
said Dr. Alain Schreiber, president of Vical Inc., a San Diego gene
therapy company.
</P>
<P>
   But others say that investors have permanently soured on
biotechnology and that the entire system by which biotechnology
companies have been created and financed is breaking down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to figure out what makes sense as a business
model for this industry,'' said Brian Atwood, a partner at
Brentwood Venture Capital in Menlo Park, Calif. ``Nobody's figured
that out yet.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not that the technology has failed. Although it has not
produced as many new drugs as early investors had anticipated,
biotechnology is now bearing fruit. Ten drugs developed by
biotechnology companies were approved or recommended for approval
in the third quarter of this year, and more than 280 drugs are in
middle- or late-stage clinical trials. And the unraveling of the
genetic code presents a cascade of opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is the long times and huge sums required to develop
these drugs. To get money, companies must sell shares to the public
years before they have products or profits. The stock price can
languish while the company conducts clinical trials. While some
drugs succeed and investors are amply rewarded, many others fail
and the stock price plummets.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have pumped an estimated $90 billion into public
biotechnology companies since 1980, according to Vector Securities
International, an investment bank specializing in health care. Yet
overall, the investment has not paid off, with biotechnology stocks
rising in only seven of 16 years, according to Vector.
</P>
<P>
   Recombinant Capital, a San Francisco consulting firm, calculated
in 1995 that an investor who put $100 into every biotechnology
initial public offering since 1980 would have earned a return of
only 1 percent a year. The figure probably would not be much
different if updated today, said Mark Edwards, the managing
director.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks of the roughly 10 big biotechnology companies, which
already have products and profits and market capitalization of more
than $1 billion, have in general risen smartly this year, but the
stocks of scores of smaller companies have plummeted. The 298
stocks tracked by Bioworld Financial Watch, a newsletter, are down
an average 18 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Privately held biotechnology companies have had difficulty going
public, and public ones have not been able to sell new shares.
</P>
<P>
   The publicly traded companies raised $2.4 billion from investors
through October, less than half the $4.9 billion raised in the
corresponding period of 1997, according to Burrill &AMP; Co., a San
Francisco merchant bank.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists, who provide seed money, are also becoming
more cautious. The absolute amount of venture capital invested in
biotechnology has remained steady since 1995, but the industry's
share of total venture investment has shrunk, according to
PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting and consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Such prominent Silicon Valley venture firms as Accel Partners
and Sequoia Capital have quit investing in biotechnology to focus
on software and Internet companies, which do not face the same
capital requirements and regulatory hurdles. Others have become
more cautious about starting companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things that were started should have stayed in a
government lab or university lab,'' said Sam Colella, managing
partner of Institutional Venture Partners in Menlo Park.
</P>
<P>
   He cited one of his own company's investments _ Athena
Neurosciences Inc., which was founded in 1986 based on an idea a
professor had about Alzheimer's disease. Athena eventually
succeeded by licensing products from other companies, and it was
acquired by a bigger company. But the idea on which the company was
founded has not led to a drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``Athena's original premise would not get a dollar of venture
capital today,'' Colella said. ``I'm going to find things that are
close to the market.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, many start-ups have been companies that
provided research tools or services like gene-hunting or chemical
screening to the big drug companies. These companies can become
profitable far more quickly than those trying to develop drugs,
though there is some question about how big they can ultimately
become.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One source of financing that is growing is from big drug
companies. Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc. of San Diego raised $380
million from corporate partners, while its three public stock
offerings have yielded just $107 million.
</P>
<P>
   The big companies sometimes find it quicker and less expensive
to license a drug or technology from a biotechnology company than
to develop it on their own. So the biotechnology companies are
becoming suppliers to the big pharmaceutical companies, much like
auto parts companies supply Detroit, said Edwards of Recombinant
Capital.
</P>
<P>
   But to get cash, biotechnology companies often must give up the
rights to sell the products they develop, accepting royalty
payments instead. That cuts into potential future profits and can
further discourage investors.
</P>
<P>
   The big drug companies are more interested in drugs that have
advanced partly through clinical trials. So for earlier-stage
biotechnology companies, the outlook remains bleak. More than 50 of
the 345 publicly traded biotechnology companies tracked by Vector
Securities will run out of cash within a year if they continue
spending at their current rates and are unable to raise new money.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be some kind of Darwinist mechanism going on
here,'' said Franklin Berger, an analyst with J.P. Morgan
Securities. ``This is the year we'll see a final winnowing out
among the biotech companies.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Cellpro Inc. of Bothell, Wash., said in September
that it would liquidate because it did not have enough money to pay
damages after losing a patent infringement suit.
</P>
<P>
   The Biofield Corp., an Atlanta company developing a noninvasive
way to detect breast cancer, said last month that it had eliminated
substantially all of its operations and was now trying to license
or sell its technology. LXR Biotechnology Inc. of Richmond, Calif.,
said in October that it would concentrate on three key programs,
mainly cardiology drugs, discontinuing other projects like an
imaging system for studying genes and molecules.
</P>
<P>
   And Celtrix Pharmaceuticals Inc. laid off 90 percent of its work
force, mostly in manufacturing, in September. That cut the
company's ``burn rate'' _ the amount of money it loses each year _
from $13 million to $2 million. The Santa Clara, Calif., company
now has only about 10 employees, who are trying to push the
company's main drug through clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say companies will be forced into mergers. ``The
solution is either M &AMP; A or B _ bankruptcy,'' the chairman of
Vector Securities, D. Theodore Berghorst, told biotechnology
executives at a recent conference in San Diego run by Biocom, a
trade group.
</P>
<P>
   The Megabios Corp. and Genemedicine Inc., two gene therapy
companies, recently agreed to merge. ``It gets tougher and tougher
to say there will be new investors stepping up to the plate,'' said
Richard A. Waldron, Genemedicine's chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   But a wave of mergers has long been predicted for biotechnology
and has so far failed to materialize. Some companies are selling
stock in private placements or issuing preferred stock at prices
that dilute existing shareholders. Some are trying to raise money
in Europe, where investors seem more receptive than in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   For all the worries, some executives remain confident that
medical innovations will still receive financing. ``We know
ultimately science will win,'' said Howard Birndorf, chairman of
Nanogen Inc., San Diego. ``These products will help people, and
there will be markets for them.''

 &HT;    OSU player wants one more year in college-level sports
 &HT;    By Susan Vinella
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ As the seniors on this year's Ohio State
football team prepare for their final college game in the Jan. 1
Sugar Bowl, at least one among them may not have to say goodbye so
soon.
</P>
<P>
   Senior tailback Joe Montgomery, a backup to junior Michael Wiley
this year, is petitioning the NCAA for another season of
eligibility. Montgomery, a 5-11, 216-pound running back from
Illinois, believes he was wrongly declared academically ineligible
his freshman season after the NCAA Clearinghouse did not approve an
economics course he took in high school. That class is now accepted
by the Clearinghouse as a core course, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a possibility that I can come back,'' Montgomery said
Tuesday during an interview at OSU's Woody Hayes Athletic Center.
``Right now I'm weighing those options heavily.''
</P>
<P>
   OSU coach John Cooper said he expects Montgomery to return if
the NCAA gives the OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was under the impression that if (his petition) is granted,
he's going to come back,'' Cooper said. ``I mean, why would he file
a petition if he's not going to come back?
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's approved, there's no question in my mind he should
come back. And I think it should be approved. I think Joe is what
college football's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery, who has become sort of a poster man for overcoming
adversity while at OSU, has become a fan favorite as much for his
hard-nosed, physical running style as for his upbeat attitude and
his perseverance.
</P>
<P>
   After practicing with the team during the first few days of fall
camp as a freshman, Montgomery learned he had not been cleared by
the NCAA to play. He had to quit the team and lost his scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   He rejoined the team in 1995 and redshirted. In 1996, he blew
out his knee halfway through the season and had to undergo major
reconstructive surgery. More knee trouble cut his 1997 season short
and forced him to undergo additional knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the setbacks, he continued to rehab vigorously and never
lost hope that he'd return.
</P>
<P>
   This season, as the No. 2 tailback, Montgomery played in all 11
of the Buckeyes games and rushed for 682 yards and six touchdowns.
His 6.1 yards per carry average is second on the team behind Wiley
(6.3).
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery said because he believes he was wrongly denied the
opportunity to practice or play with the team as a freshman, he
deserves another season. He said the high school economics course
that the NCAA didn't recognize in 1994 was ``ruled a core course by
the state of Illinois, the Board of education, by my high school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of other athletes at my high school took the course and
went on to play Division I football,'' he said. ``But I took it and
I was a casualty of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery said he doesn't know when a decision will be made on
his petition. An OSU administrator would not comment other than to
say the request was still in its ``very early stages'' and a lot of
questions have yet to be answered.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA does not comment on pending petitions, an NCAA official
said.

TAYMOR'S ENCORE (IT'S NOT DISNEY)  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 20) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ The location is Rome. The scene is set in ancient Rome.
But the look and feel of the site is Roman history repeated as
farce.
</P>
<P>
   There are no togas. Roman senators wear 30s-style white evening
jackets with white wool scarves draped across their chests. A
candidate to become emperor campaigns in a 1950s white Thunderbird
convertible with loudspeakers attached, his rival in a 1940s black
Bentley mounted with silver wolf heads.
</P>
<P>
   Actors and extras mill on the vast white marble piazza before
the Palazzo della Civilta del Lavoro, a solemn building of marble
arches that looms over EUR, the grandiose exhibition park Mussolini
built in the 1930s to fuse Roman Empire and Fascist might. And that
was what drew the theater director Julie Taymor to select it as a
site for ``Titus,'' her film adaptation of Shakespeare's tragedy
``Titus Andronicus.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its quality is eventually judged to be, this is no
ordinary venture. It is Ms. Taymor's first feature film, with a
starry cast that includes Anthony Hopkins in the title role,
Jessica Lange and Alan Cumming, who took a leave from his
Tony-Award-winning role as the master of ceremonies in the Broadway
revival of ``Cabaret'' to take part in this movie project.
</P>
<P>
   But it is still more: this is Ms. Taymor's first major venture
since her extraordinary success last year with Disney's ``Lion
King'' _ a show that she transformed with her direction, design and
musical choices from a potentially potted theatricalization of a
cartoon movie into Broadway's biggest hit, with myriad
international and road show companies in the works.
</P>
<P>
   In so doing, she went a long way toward legitimizing Disney as a
force for serious commercial musicals, and she became one of two
women ever to win a Tony Award for directing (Garry Hines won the
same night last spring, for the drama ``The Beauty Queen of
Leenane''); the award presumably sits on her mantelpiece next to
the notice for her MacArthur ``genius'' grant.
</P>
<P>
   All of which makes for a large and fascinated mainstream
audience awaiting her next move. And there are other audiences
equally curious as to what she's up to now: admirers of her
downtown and nonprofit theatrical ventures, and of her forays into
opera stage direction and design, from Stravinsky's ``Oedipus Rex''
in Matsumoto, Japan to Wagner's ``Flying Dutchman'' in Los Angeles
to Richard Strauss's ``Salome'' in St. Petersburg, Russia.
</P>
<P>
   So why, one might wonder, for all the star power of her cast,
would she choose to exercise her considerable leverage on an
obscure and bloody Shakespeare play with seemingly limited appeal?
Is this a visionary move, artistic willfulness or career suicide?
For Ms. Taymor, it just seemed the right next move, the project she
most wanted to undertake now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real millennium piece,'' she explained during a break
from the filming. She was wearing a baseball jacket inscribed with
the name of one of her early experimental plays, ``Juan Darien,''
more recently revived at Lincoln Center, not ``The Lion King,''
which has made her famous. ``It's ancient Rome and contemporary
Rome,'' she said. ``I didn't want to make a period piece, the 30s
or 40s, it's an essence of all of that. Everybody will know it when
they see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins, who plays Titus, a Roman general, strides about dressed
in a black double-breasted wool jacket, black boots and red leather
cape that make him look like a cross between Admiral Nelson and
Joseph Goebbels.
</P>
<P>
   In an early scene, Titus has failed to appease Saturninus, the
eldest _ and most capricious _ son of the Emperor, played by
Cumming. Wearing a red frock coat that suggests a malevolent Little
Prince, he races down the capitol steps to angrily refuse Titus's
offer of his daughter Lavinia.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins appears baffled by the unreasoned burst of hostility.
Ms. Lange, however, looks devilishly pleased. She plays Tamora,
Queen of the Goths, captured by Titus and brought as a slave to
Rome, where she quickly seduces Saturninus. Dressed in a gold
breastplate, shimmering gold chain-mail skirt, with her hair
slicked back in gold cornrows and her face painted in gold, Ms.
Lange slinks haughtily down the marble steps like a thoroughly bad
Bond girl.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Taymor is hardly the first director to reset Shakespeare in
a modern period; English upper-class fascism, for example, was the
backdrop to Ian McKellen's stage and film versions of ``Richard
III.'' Leonardo DiCaprio and Clare Danes starred in a 1996 film
version of ``Romeo and Juliet'' set in contemporary Florida. There
will be an echo of both films in Titus.
</P>
<P>
   As she did in her 1994 stage version of the play, Ms. Taymor
eschews an exact period and instead picks some of the most familiar
symbols of violence and brutality, mixing ancient Rome, 30s fascism
and 90s urban decadence in an effort to make ``Titus Andronicus''
more palatable to modern audiences, particularly younger ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of humor, and it's very contemporary and hip,''
she said, before adding, ``Actually, I hate the word `hip.' It's
`edgy.' '' She went on, ``The humor in `As You Like It' is quaint.
This is right-now humor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Titus Andronicus'' is not usually known for its comedy. One of
Shakespeare's earliest and bloodiest plays, it is a gruesome and
too often numbing succession of mutilations, floggings,
decapitations and murders. Titus's daughter Lavinia, for example,
is raped, then her tongue and hands are cut off. To avenge her
disgrace, Titus kills Lavinia, then kills her rapists, bakes their
flesh in a pie and tricks their mother, Tamora, into eating it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Titus Andronicus'' was hugely popular when Shakespeare was
alive but rather quickly fell out of favor and stayed there. It was
only in the 1950s, when Peter Brook staged it in Stratford-on-Avon
with Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh, that the play won a
reappraisal. In the last few years ``Titus Andronicus'' has once
again gone through a revisionist revival, but it is still rarely
performed, perhaps because the ceaseless flow of baroque
bloodletting tends to overshadow the plot and characters.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Taymor said she welcomed the over-the-top violence as a
perfect metaphor for our age, one shaped by the Holocaust, ethnic
cleansing in Bosnia, religious wars in the Middle East. In the
three weeks of rehearsals she held in Rome before shooting began in
early October, she repeatedly urged the actors to find contemporary
meaning in the ancient violence.
</P>
<P>
   The director also said that the film would be an antidote to the
make-believe blood and guts of most modern movies. ``We are so
inured to violence, whether it's `Braveheart' or Spielberg's
`Saving Private Ryan,' we validate war as a vehicle for heroism,''
she complained. In ``Titus,'' she argued, there is a reason for the
violence (mostly revenge). But there is no heroism. ``I don't like
violence,'' Ms. Taymor said. ``But I love this.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Ms. Taymor's first full-length feature film, a daring
choice for a first-time movie director, let alone for an
experimental theater director and designer best known for her
powerful visual images drawn from world folklore and the puppetry
and dance of Indonesia, India, Japan and beyond. She said that
after her first encounter with the play, in 1994, she jumped at the
invitation to make a film version of it (for Overseas Filmgroup, a
distribution company, and Clear Blue Sky Productions, the
billionaire Paul Allen's film production company.)
</P>
<P>
   Directing the play as a film, she said, gave her the chance to
expand the use of visual images beyond the limitations of the
stage. ``I got to fully imagine the film,'' Ms. Taymor explained.
``I try to add depth to each scene through the choice of location.
There is a moment when Titus is begging for the life of his son. He
is at a crossroads, and so I filmed him at a crossroads.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Taymor does not take locations lightly. For scenes in a
Roman amphitheater, she insisted that the entire production travel
to Pula, Croatia, because the Roman amphitheater there is better
preserved than those in Italy or Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
   Even though she is known for creating her own, highly original
costumes and set designs, Ms. Taymor recruited the Oscar-nominated
production designer Dante Ferretti, known for his work with
Federico Fellini and Martin Scorsese, among others, and the Academy
Award-winning costume designer Milena Canonero (``Chariots of
Fire'') to help her create a singular look for the film.
</P>
<P>
   She has added her own sensibility and visual touches to the
play-turned-screenplay. Much of the most gory violence, including
the rape of Lavinia, takes place off-camera. Taymor invented five
dream sequences she calls Penny Arcade Nightmares that will be
interjected in the film to recreate the violence in a heightened,
surreal way. She described them as ``haikus'' within the piece.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband and longtime collaborator, the composer Elliot
Goldenthal, who created the music for most of her other
productions, is also writing the music for ``Titus,'' including
music for the Penny Arcade dream sequences that the director
delightedly described as having a ``twisted carnivalesque feel.''
</P>
<P>
   So will the entire movie, it seems. ``I think the play has been
terribly underrated and unappreciated,'' Ms. Taymor said. ``I find
it so beautiful and powerful. For 200 years it was discarded as
tasteless and over the top, but I think it is exactly right for our
times _ outrageous humor juxtaposed to potent tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   That, along with Taymor's reputation, brought Anthony Hopkins on
board.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Titus Andronicus' is so outlandish and bizarre,'' Hopkins
explained cheerfully. He was seated in his trailer, parked to the
side of the outdoor set, recalling how he had sworn never to do
Shakespeare again after legendary performances onstage in ``Antony
and Cleopatra,'' ``King Lear'' and what he referred to with actor's
superstition as ``the Scottish play.'' He added, ``But if I was
going to do Shakespeare again, I wanted to do something completely
different and outlandish. And this was it.''
</P>
<P>
   He grinned when asked if the character of Titus was familiar.
``You mean a combination of King Lear and Hannibal Lecter, I
suppose. No, no, I've never played anyone else like this before.''
</P>
<P>
   Titus is a Roman general who returns to Rome a war hero and who,
to appease the gods, ritually kills the eldest son of his conquered
enemy, the Queen of the Goths. His stubborn rejection of the
Queen's pleas for mercy unleashes cycle after cycle of revenge and
counter-revenge, ending in a bloody banquet at which almost
everyone dies. Hopkins describes Titus as ``rigid and
authoritarian.'' Ms. Taymor described him as a ``Schwarzkopf or
Colin Powell.''
</P>
<P>
   It was while filming ``Instinct'' with Cuba Gooding Jr. in
Florida last spring that Hopkins met with Ms. Taymor and became
intrigued by her ideas for the play. Almost dutifully, Hopkins paid
homage to the production's anti-violence message: ``There is the
barbarity of human nature. I am aware of it, I feel it myself.'' He
chuckled and quickly added, ``What I respond to is her sense of the
grotesque.''
</P>
<P>
   And it is the Grand Guignol aspect of the play he enjoys most.
``It's grotesquely funny; there are moments of ridiculous violence
when you just laugh.'' He was referring, among other things, to a
late scene in which Titus prepares to serve Tamora the pie made
from her sons' corpses. ``The pie is cooling behind a gingham
curtain, like something out of Betty Crocker,'' he said. ``It's
very funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins said he enjoyed working with Ms. Taymor and admired her
theater-honed perfectionism _ up to a point. ``We had a couple of
arguments _ she is really a choreographer, they try to show you
what they want. I won't do it that way.'' He added gruffly: ``My
view is, `Don't act it out for me, let me do it.' I get quite tough
and no longer put up with that.'' Then, more mildly, ``I hope I
don't get too irascible.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins seemed less reverent about the play than its director.
``It's easy, very basic verse, not as complex as `Antony and
Cleopatra,' '' he said. ``It's not a great tragedy. An early work
in progress, probably not more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Taymor, however, says the play contains ``all the seeds of
other great Shakespeare characters,'' like Lear, Iago and Lady
Macbeth. In ``Titus Andronicus,'' as in ``Othello,'' there is a
Moor. In ``Titus Andronicus,'' he is named Aaron (played by Harry
J. Lennix), and he has Iago's sly villainy.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Aaron is the only great black character in Shakespeare,'' Ms.
Taymor said stoutly. ``He's much more interesting than Othello.''
Some critics describe Aaron as a character who, like Iago, has no
motive for his treachery. ``You have to make up a motivation for
Iago,'' she said, ``but Aaron is reacting to racism. There is so
much racism in the text.''
</P>
<P>
   She argued that Tamora's character is richer and deeper than
Lady Macbeth's. ``She is sexy and funny, and we know why she is so
murderous: her son was sacrificed. It's a much better part.''
</P>
<P>
   Tweezing the ancient tale for contemporary sensibilities, Ms.
Taymor described Lavinia as ``empowered'' because, as she put it,
``she goes through this horrendous experience and learns to accept
her condition.'' Ms. Taymor spoke of Lavinia's ``condition,'' a
severed tongue and two severed hands, as if it were diabetes or
chronic fatigue syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Ms. Taymor directed a movie version of her staging of
the opera ``Oedipus Rex'' and also directed a short film, ``Fool's
Fire,'' an adaptation of an Edgar Allan Poe story. She said she was
not prepared for the aggravation of a feature-length production and
what she lamented as ``the lack of control,'' over weather, Italian
crews and other acts of God.
</P>
<P>
   The production in Italy had its full share of setbacks and
delays; in one, the extras refused to take off their clothes for a
Roman orgy scene. So Ms. Taymor hired a separate cast of extras
made up of people who perform in pornographic films.
</P>
<P>
   But the only clear sign she shows on the set of being a
first-time director is her habit at every pause of leaping up from
her chair before the monitor and racing over to the actors as if
she were still in a theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Film directors communicate less; they tend to be fatter from
sitting at the monitor all day,'' joked Cumming, 33, the Scottish
actor who plays Saturninus, Titus's enemy, as a hissing, slithering
neurotic. ``Theater directors are jumping around a bit more.''
</P>
<P>
   It was dark and cold as Ms. Taymor leapt from her director's
chair for the ninth time to discuss with Jessica Lange how the
actress should look in a shot where she walks up marble stairs in a
gold lame dress. Ms. Lange confided that the dress was too long,
and Ms. Taymor instructed a costume assistant to cut a five-inch
swath from the bottom. Hesitantly, Ms. Lange asked the director
whether her face should betray any grieving. Ms. Taymor considered
the question, her head bowed in concentration. ``No,'' she replied
slowly. ``I think you should give it that Supreme Goddess thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lange said she had had trepidations about doing the play.
``I had always shied away from Shakespeare,'' she said. ``It's a
cultural thing. I just think English actors have an access to the
language American actors don't have.'' The chance to work with
Anthony Hopkins and Julie Taymor (``I saw `The Lion King,' '' Ms.
Lange explained. ``Who hasn't?'') overcame her self-doubts. And as
it turned out, trouble on the set came not from Shakespeare's verse
but from the heavy gold costumes Tamora wears.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the worst costumes I've ever worn in my life,'' she
said with a rueful laugh in her trailer as she tore off what
remained of the heavy gold lame gown. She had even harsher words
for the gold breastplate. ``I look Wagnerian in it. It's the least
flattering thing I've ever put on my body.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lange, whose last film role was that of an unattractive and
insanely doting mother in the 1998 thriller ``Hush,'' said she was
pleased to be ``given a chance'' to play a powerful, glamorous role
``that's not a typical mother in a domestic drama.'' She added with
a smile, ``Well, actually, it is (italics)kind(end italics) of a
mother in a domestic drama.''

 &HT;    Baseball's problems only worsening with free-agent frenzy
 &HT;    By Gary Nuhn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Baseball's owners and general managers bidding
against each other are like 8-year-olds in a toy store with all the
adults locked in the backroom.
</P>
<P>
   Except 8-year-olds have more self-control.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last month, and especially the last five days in
Nashville, baseball teams have once again written checks against
the future of the game. Five players _ Mike Piazza, Mo Vaughn,
Bernie Williams, Randy Johnson and Kevin Brown _ have signed
contracts for a total of $453.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   As Alexander Hamilton wrote in The Federalist Papers: ``This is
ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   (Actually, Hamilton wrote nothing of the sort; this was a
gratuitous attempt on my part to tie in baseball with actual
important issues of the day, and I beg your forgiveness.)
</P>
<P>
   If you think all the teams aren't at fault, you are missing the
big picture.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Dodgers giving Kevin Brown $105 million plus access to
the Fox Corporate jet redefines the word, ``absurd,'' but only
slightly more than the local team, the Dayton-Cincinnati Red and
Black Hats, signing Steve Avery for a million-5.
</P>
<P>
   I hate to be the one to bring this up, but Steve Avery has been
a batting practice pitcher for four years. He is no longer the boy
wonder who threw 92-mph speedballs by Pittsburgh batters in the
playoffs of 1991 and '92. Now he's a puff-ball thrower whose record
since 1994 _ all spent with clubs (Atlanta and Boston) that won big
_ is 30-37.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not saying Avery will flop. I'm saying he should be paid the
minimum with incentives. Instead, if Avery makes the Opening Day
roster _ which in itself is a 50-50 proposition _ he is guaranteed
$1.5 million with a chance to make $2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   This is, of course, why there is no pro basketball being played
right now. The NBA owners saw destruction coming, locked the doors
and headed for the storm cellar until something rational could be
worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's owners handed their checkbooks to the agents and
said, ``Fill in the blank.''
</P>
<P>
   The funniest quote in the post-Brown wailing was from Padre
owner John Moores, whose team lost Brown. ``It's a truly tragic day
for baseball,'' he said. ``I think the system is at the point of
absolutely breaking down. We're on the verge of destroying the
competitiveness of many, many ballclubs.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the same man who was reportedly offering Brown around
$80 mill.
</P>
<P>
   So the guy up north, Rupert Murdoch, Australian megalomaniac and
megamillionaire, offered him a little more and the system is
``breaking down.''
</P>
<P>
   Dear John: Here's some news from Siege Headquarters: The system
has been broken for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Only the rich franchises make the playoffs. The poor teams stay
home. The question thus becomes, if a team starts a season with no
chance to win, and its fans know it, what will get them to the
park?
</P>
<P>
   That's the stark, corrosive reality baseball faces through the
next several years as long as King Donald Fehr and his players
association refuse to acknowledge the problem and the solution (a
salary cap).
</P>
<P>
   Brown will be 34 when next season starts. His guaranteed $105
million will be paid over seven years. What are the odds that at
the end of the contract, in the years 2004 and 2005, he will be
worth 15 million beans?
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa helped us immerse ourselves in the
game again last summer, and for a couple of months forget the
problems at the core of the beast.
</P>
<P>
   But those problems are still there, and getting worse.

 &HT;    The $7 Million Party
 &HT;    By Cheryl Blackerby
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASSAU, Bahamas _ The party for the humongous Royal Towers
Hotel, which opened last weekend on Paradise Island, reportedly
cost $7 million.
</P>
<P>
   So what do you get when you're invited to that kind of bash?
</P>
<P>
   You get Michael Jackson, with ghoulish white face, heavy black
eyeliner and red lipstick, singing Heal the World in a wispy voice.
</P>
<P>
   You get Grace Jones, dressed like a flamboyant fairy with huge
wings, sliding down a wire from a 17-story-high bridge connecting
two buildings.
</P>
<P>
   And you get a barefoot Jimmy Buffett singing Margaritaville with
KC and the Sunshine Band under a starry sky on a sandy beach.
</P>
<P>
   It's not every party that has a lineup of Natalie Cole, Stevie
Wonder, James Ingram, Patty Austin, Tevin Campbell and an orchestra
conducted by Quincy Jones. (Whitney Houston, scheduled to arrive
Friday, was a no-show.)
</P>
<P>
   The 1,200-room hotel, built by billionaire South African
casino-hotel owner Sol Kerzner, is part of the Atlantis hotel
complex, which opened in 1994. The Royal Towers features a 70-foot,
domed, gold-gilded rotunda worthy of a cathedral. The ``Mayan
Temple'' supports a 60-foot slide that propels guests through a
clear acrylic tunnel submerged in a shark-filled lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   The new hotel brings the total number of rooms of Atlantis to
2,300 and the total cost to $800 million. There are almost 40
restaurants and bars, a marina and an enormous casino. The resort
is the country's biggest employer outside of the government.
</P>
<P>
   Even the wealthiest of guests were awed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sol is a visionary. He has brought the ocean into the resort.
It's incredible,'' said Ivana Trump. The resort has the largest
outdoor aquarium in the world. The new hotel features a labyrinth
of aquariums giving a peek into ``The Lost Continent of Atlantis''
_ sharks and tunas? swimming past ancient-looking fallen columns
and stones carved with Mayan art.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, the Royal Towers was filled with 2,000
invitation-only guests, many of them famous, including Denzel
Washington and Leonardo DiCaprio. They were joined by throngs of
the semi-famous, all posing for interviews with Entertainment
Tonight and Extra.
</P>
<P>
   Bahamian-born actor Sydney Poitier mingled with the crowds,
putting his arm around bartenders and housekeepers and shaking
hands with Bahamian politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Actress Marisa Tomei, sleek and sexy in skintight lime pants and
pink tank, strolled around comfortably alone, smiling brightly for
photographers and fans.
</P>
<P>
   Others didn't feel obliged to rub elbows with the masses, even
if the masses were invitation-only. Oprah walked through the
gardens with an entourage of 50 people who formed a wall around
her. Fiance Stedman Graham stayed 100 feet behind, with no
entourage.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Roberts walked slightly hunched over, gripping the arms of
two women on either side of her. She brought her boyfriend,
Benjamin Bratt, but he wasn't in sight when she arrived at the
Saturday night bash. She looked pale, thin and a little frightened.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the couples ...
</P>
<P>
   Donald Trump, in a dark suit, danced with model Melania Knauss 6
feet from former wife Ivana and her fabulous white-suited Italian
boyfriend. In the afternoon, Ivana and her beau, Roffredo Gaetani,
were kissing in the casino.
</P>
<P>
   Former Baywatch babe Yasmine Bleeth and former 21 Jump Street
star Richard Grieco cruised the party holding hands.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night set the tone for this estimated $7-million
wingding. (Atlantis publicists won't confirm the figure.) The 350
members of the press, including TV crews from Europe and Japan,
were stationed behind black ropes on a blocklong corridor for three
hours as guests, most in skinny gowns, swept past.
</P>
<P>
   It became a game of Trivial Pursuit trying to guess some of the
B- and C-level celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Million-dollar man!'' shouted a WGN (Chicago) TV producer,
unable to place The Six Million Dollar Man, Lee Majors.
</P>
<P>
   Next came a singing duo. An Associated Press reporter could come
up with only the song, not the names: ``Solid as rock ...'' she
sang. They were Nick Ashford and Valerie Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Leach, dapper in a white suit and vest, was all business
as he searched out famous faces in the opulent public rooms, thick
with cigar smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Free Bacardi rum and Dom Perignon flowed as guests discussed
whether this hotel would continue to attract high rollers to its
expensive rooms _ the least pricey is $430, dropping to $330 Jan.
3.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one ugly moment: A member of Michael Jackson's
entourage yelled ``Get the f--- out of the way'' in front of a
children's choir and a group of appalled Bahamian mothers.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel opened for business Sunday afternoon. The first
customers, unknowns dressed in unglamorous tank tops and shorts,
seemed awed by the hotel. They immediately snapped photos of the
lobby while waiting for rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ODD-O_METER BOC
</P>
<P>
   Who's weird and who's normal? How the beautiful people behave:
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jackson was surrounded by 20 prize-fighter-type goons
who swore within earshot of Bahamian children and their shocked
mothers. Jackson also plucked children from the crowd to join him
while he sang. Their mothers looked nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Trump had a model on his arm and a constant scowl on his
face.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney Poitier strolled through the crowd, shaking hands with
fans.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Roberts walked through the crowd hunched over and gripping
the arms of two young women.
</P>
<P>
   Oprah Winfrey kept a wall of 50 handlers around her. (Fiance
Stedman Graham followed 100 feet behind _ with no entourage.)
</P>
<P>
   Natalie Cole, elegant and serene, sang like a dream and chatted
with the common folk.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Buffett, barefoot and happy, roamed through the crowd
joking with fans.

CITIGROUP TO CUT GLOBAL WORK FORCE BY 10,600

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Citigroup, one of the country's largest financial
services companies, said on Tuesday that it planned to eliminate
about 10,600 jobs, or about 6 percent of its work force, well
beyond the several thousand positions it suggested would be cut as
recently as October.
</P>
<P>
   An undisclosed but substantial number of the job cuts will
involve layoffs. Citigroup said 65 percent, or about 6,890, of the
cuts would be overseas. The rest, about 3,710 positions, will be in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   When Citicorp and Travelers Group Inc. announced in April that
they planned to merge, the companies focused on the financial
benefits of the merger and said that cost-cutting and layoffs were
not the reasons for the deal. But global financial markets have
been pummeled since late summer, forcing Citigroup to adopt less
ambitious goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've wanted the world to believe that this merger was about
revenue enhancement and cross-selling,'' said John Keefe, president
of Keefe Worldwide, a financial services consulting firm in New
York. ``But having a big layoff like this is at cross-purposes with
revenue enhancement, particularly if your goal is cross-selling.
More and more, the logic of the deal appears to be cost-cutting.''
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup employees said that New York, where the company is
based, would not bear the brunt of the cutbacks in the United
States. In fact, Citigroup noted that its telephone call centers,
which support businesses like credit cards, would have cutbacks.
Call centers abroad would be hardest hit, according to employees
involved in the moves. Citigroup's main call centers in the United
States are in Jacksonville, Fla.; San Antonio; Las Vegas, Nev.;
Sioux Falls, S.D.; Hagerstown, Md.; Kansas City, Mo.; St. Louis,
and Erlanger, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup comprises a consumer business, which includes
operations like traditional loans, savings accounts and credit
cards, and a corporate business, which includes operations like
investment banking, lending to big companies and trading.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup said it expected to cut about $525 million in costs
from its consumer business and about $350 million from its
corporate business.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup said the largest portion of the job cuts would occur
in the consumer business. ``These include regional consolidation of
call centers and other back-office functions worldwide, reduction
of management layers, sales force restructuring and integration of
overlapping marketing and product management groups,'' Citigroup
said.
</P>
<P>
   On the corporate side, Citigroup has already been scaling back
its trading operation. It said Tuesday that it would also make
cutbacks in ``emerging markets, global relationship banking and
investment banking.''
</P>
<P>
   In trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of
Citigroup jumped $2.6875, or 5.8 percent, to $48.75.
</P>
<P>
   Many big Wall Street firms have been announcing layoffs in
response to financial turmoil overseas, which has eaten into those
companies' profits. Even so, Citigroup has repeatedly played down
how large its cutbacks would be.
</P>
<P>
   In October, a Citigroup spokesman, John Morris, said that the
bank planned no further job cuts beyond the several thousand that
the company had announced in September. Morris said Tuesday that
the size of the cutback was determined by Citigroup managers who
were told to analyze their operations in September and then
determine how many jobs could be cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``The businesses have come back with more than had been
anticipated at that time,'' Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup declined to be more specific about which businesses or
which geographic regions would face cutbacks, although it said it
planned to drop ``several nonstrategic operations'' in both the
consumer and corporate businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup executives have called such businesses ``hobbies''
because, in their view, the company lacks either the size or the
competence in those arenas to be competitive. Citigroup certainly
does not enjoy the advantage of size in businesses like mortgage
lending and student loans. And some European consumer businesses
may be on the block.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup forecast a big fourth-quarter charge for
reorganization in recent weeks, and the company said Tuesday that
it would incur an after-tax charge of about $900 million, ``the
bulk of which'' would be taken in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Although Citigroup said at the time of the merger that it
expected after-tax savings of about $1 billion a year, it said
Tuesday that after-tax savings in 1999 would be only about $442
million and that after-tax savings in 2000 would be only about $634
million.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that Citigroup might have to be more aggressive
about cutbacks if it intended to meet some of its goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This restructuring charge is chump change when you look at the
$40 billion cost base of the company,'' said Diane Glossman, an
analyst with Lehman Brothers Inc. ``It's just not a big
percentage.''

TRIAL OF MAN ACCUSED IN DRAGGING DEATH TO BE HELD IN JASPER, JUDGE
RULES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICHARD STEWART 
and PATTY REINERT 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ The capital murder trial of one of three white
men charged in the brutal dragging death of a black man last summer
will be held in Jasper, a state judge ruled Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge Joe Bob Golden also denied a defense
attorney's request for sweeping restrictions of the news coverage
of the trial of John William ``Bill'' King.
</P>
<P>
   King, 24, of Jasper, is charged with dragging James Byrd Jr.,
49, by the ankles behind a pickup for almost three miles along back
country roads early June 7. Along the way his head and one arm were
ripped off. Jury selection is scheduled to start Jan. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Golden said the motion to move the trial could be reconsidered
any time prior to the jury being seated, meaning that if lawyers
have difficulty selecting jurors in Jasper County, the trial may
still be moved.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what was anticipated,'' said court-appointed defense
attorney C. Haden ``Sonny'' Cribbs Jr. of Beaumont. ``If we get one
(a jury), we have a good appeals point and if we don't, we'll go on
down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Cribbs said during a hearing Monday that the case has gotten too
much publicity in Jasper County. He also said potential jurors in
that county might be biased because a property tax increase of two
cents per $100 was instituted to pay for trials of the three
defendants in the Byrd death and two other unrelated killings last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   The case has garnered more media attention than any trial in
Jasper history, with news crews from as far away as Australia
arriving to cover the story.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also rejected a Dallas television station's request to
have a television camera in the courtroom. Golden said no
television or still cameras will be allowed on the second floor of
Jasper's 109-year-old courthouse. The courtroom is on that floor.
He said that if the ``first floor of the courthouse becomes
congested or the media impedes the normal use of the courthouse
offices, then we will deal with that if it occurs.''
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth attorney Roger Diseker said television station KTVT,
Court TV and other stations were hoping to have a pool camera to
provide live video of the trial. He said he doesn't know if
television stations or networks will appeal the ruling to the Texas
9th Circuit Court of Appeals in Beaumont.
</P>
<P>
   Golden set aside 24 of the 100 seats in the courtroom for the
media. He said the media could pay to have an audio feed from the
trial wired to a basement lunchroom and kitchen, but none of the
audio could be broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   He also prohibited photographing or releasing the names of
jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Cribbs had asked the judge to prohibit the media from
photographing King as he was brought into and out of the
courthouse, from photographing or interviewing witnesses, from
having sketch artists in the courtroom or reporting any of King's
criminal history. Golden overruled those motions.
</P>
<P>
   Four Texas newspapers filed an answer asking the judge to rule
against the restrictions requested by Cribbs. Cribbs said he hadn't
expected the judge to adopt many of the media restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Golden directed both sides in the case to provide
representatives at the end of each day for a news briefing to be
held at a gazebo on the courthouse's picturesque grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Cribbs jokingly predicted that the outside news conferences may
be brief if the weather in late January and February turns bitterly
cold.
</P>
<P>
   Golden has not ruled whether the jury will be sequestered after
it is picked.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors called King the ringleader of the three men accused
of what they have called a racially motivated murder. They said
they also are seeking the death penalty for Lawrence Russell Brewer
Jr., 31, of Sulphur Springs, and Shawn Berry, 23, of Jasper. Dates
for those trials have not been set.

 WASHINGTON: has done.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yet senators did not rule out the possibility that the Senate
would settle on a compromise short of impeachment after a trial was
under way. Under Senate rules, a trial could be abandoned at any
point by a majority vote. That could happen if members decided to
censure Clinton or rebuke him in some other fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they anticipate a trial, Democratic and Republican
senators said it still appeared unlikely that there was the
two-thirds majority necessary under the Constitution to remove a
president from office. Still, many senators have refused to say how
they might vote, citing their roles as jurors in a trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conventional wisdom is probably right: that there are not
two- thirds,'' said Specter, speaking by telephone as he was
returning on Tuesday from the Middle East with Clinton. ``But it's
conceivable that in a trial attitudes could be changed.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not likely reassuring to White House officials that many
Democrats, rather than speaking up for the president, are standing
by silently, refraining from saying they would oppose any drive to
remove him from office. ``As far as I know,'' Lieberman said,
``hardly any of my colleagues in the Senate have said how they
would vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole's proposal for a censure measure appeared in an Op-Ed
article published on Wednesday in The New York Times. He wrote that
a bipartisan censure agreement, possibly including a fine, ``will
be seen as a blending of responsibility and justice'' and enable
the Senate to dispense with the matter before the new Congress
convenes in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Dole has provided a beginning point for a debate of
alternatives where senators can register their displeasure with
President Clinton, hold him accountable but avoid a formal trial,''
Torricelli said. Officials at the White House and in the Senate
Democratic leadership also said they welcomed the Dole plan.
</P>
<P>
   But several Republican senators said Dole was guilty of wishful
thinking in proposing, in the words of Hagel, to halt the process
``at the edge of the water.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment was echoed by Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., who
earlier this year called on Clinton to resign.``Especially after
the House bites the bullet, I don't think we'll be susceptible to
deal-making,'' Ashcroft said. ``My view is that the House should do
its duty. Then, if there are articles of impeachment, the
responsibility of the Senate is to sit as a juror.''
</P>
<P>
   Describing the Dole proposal as ``out of the blue,'' McCain, who
is close to Dole, his party's presidential nominee in 1996, said it
might be too late to galvanize support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever Bob Dole says something or recommends something, I
always try to examine it very carefully,'' McCain said. ``But I
think you're going to have an environment where the Republicans
don't want to feel like they've been tricked again.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials close to the Senate Republican leadership said it was
unlikely that Sen. Trent Lott, the Republican leader, would go
along with the deal envisioned by Dole _ or any compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point it's not realistic _ at the very least it's very
premature,'' one aide said of the Dole proposal, speaking on the
condition of anonymity. ``This will be a bitter, brutal fight on
the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   While several Democrats have for weeks held informal discussions
about possible compromises and rebukes intended to avoid a trial in
the Senate, no single option has gained particular momentum,
according to lawmakers and their aides.
</P>
<P>
   While senators insist that no decisions have been made, they
said a trial would probably get under way in early January. They
said they hoped the process could be handled briskly; Lott has said
his goal was for a trial lasting ``three days to three weeks.'' But
there is little precedence for a trial, and other senators said
their worst fear was a prolonged process that could take months.
</P>
<P>
   Lott has also said he hoped the Senate, to avoid becoming
preoccupied with impeachment, could function on a dual track: the
chamber would consider legislation in its morning sessions and take
up impeachment in the afternoons. Some Democrats have suggested
that they would oppose such a plan, and press for the entire matter
to be handled as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   A trial would be presided over by Chief Justice William
Rehnquist.

COMMENTARY: FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE, LIE!

   WASHINGTON _ Never has principle looked so unappealing.
</P>
<P>
   If the president keeps standing on principle and the Republicans
keep standing on principle, the two sides will blow each other up
and turn the rest of us into rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Just for the sake of argument, let's say both sides are, as they
claim, standing on principle.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' principle is this: A president who lies is not
fit to serve.
</P>
<P>
   Uh, OK.
</P>
<P>
   We really, really need to work hard here to suspend our
disbelief that the Republicans are driven by principle, rather than
any rabid, unreasoning hatred of Bill Clinton. We will ignore the
fact that Bob Barr called for Clinton's impeachment long before
anyone ever heard of Monica Lewinsky. We will ignore the fact that
the Republicans didn't seem to mind lying when they defended
Richard Nixon for so long, or when George Bush called Clarence
Thomas the best-qualified person to put on the Supreme Court, or
when Republican senators ripped into Anita Hill to save Judge
Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   We will ignore Henry Hyde's argument in 1987 that it was all
right for Ronald Reagan and Oliver North to lie about Iran-Contra
because we should consider the lie's context. ``It just seems to me
too simplistic to condemn all lying,'' Mr. Hyde (no, must have been
Dr. Jekyll) said then, according to The Los Angeles Times. ``In the
murkier grayness of the real world, choices must often be made.''
</P>
<P>
   But now the Republicans say they are acting on principle. That's
their story, and they're sticking to it. Let's move on to the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton's principle is this: He can't admit he lied under
oath because that would be a lie. He said Sunday that he would not
say he lied under oath to the grand jury because ``I could not
admit to doing something that I am quite sure I did not do.''
</P>
<P>
   Uh, OK.
</P>
<P>
   Well, somebody has to ask you this, Mr. President, so it may as
well be me: Since when? From the draft to Gennifer Flowers to
Monica Lewinsky, you, sir, have always been, as Bob Kerrey once put
it, an unusually good liar.
</P>
<P>
   Why stop now, when a lie could save your presidency? This is a
fine time to become a pathological truth-teller!
</P>
<P>
   Your mind, Mr. President, should have been concentrated by the
prospect of your hanging. But for some reason, you seem to have
lost the knack for whispering sweet nothings in our ear. You seem
to have lost your ability to do whatever it takes to win.
</P>
<P>
   Just because Hillary won't pitch in this time, don't let us
down.
</P>
<P>
   If, in the next 24 hours, you do not admit to lying to the grand
jury, to appease the handful of moderate Republicans who are saying
that's what it would take to get their votes, you will be impeached
by the House. You've built a career on appeasement. Why stop now?
</P>
<P>
   You say that saying you lied would be a lie. But isn't this a
little linear for you? After all, you have always enjoyed a
situationist relationship to the truth. Even if you have really
convinced yourself that you were difficult but not deceitful before
the grand jury, even if you are still clinging to the delusion that
you never did have sexual relations with That Woman, even if you
are nervous about being prosecuted after you leave office, you must
do what you have always done before: Compartmentalize, Mr.
President, compartmentalize.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Americans are looking down the barrel of a long and
scalding impeachment trial, this is not the time for William
Jefferson Clinton to do a George Washington imitation.
</P>
<P>
   This is the moment for Bill Clinton to be Bill Clinton. This is
one of those rare instances when two wrongs do make a right.
</P>
<P>
   C'mon, Mr. President, you can do it. It's just like getting on a
bicycle. After all, failing to lie now would be an even more
destructive act than telling that lie back on Jan. 21 was, when you
wagged your finger at the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Do it for us, if not for yourself. You've lied before to save
yourself. Now you must lie to save us.
</P>
<P>
   A huge majority of Americans believe you committed perjury and
still want you to stay in office.
</P>
<P>
   Back in January, you faced a similar dilemma _ to lie or tell
the truth. You asked Dick Morris to take a poll to see which way
you should go.
</P>
<P>
   Do now what you did then. Read the poll. Tell a lie.
</P>
<P>
   Tell us what we want to hear.

 &HT;    Hunger strike takes aim at INS deportation ruling
 &HT;    By Bill Douthat
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A former Lake Worth, Fla. resident is
pleading with immigration officials to deport him to his native
Honduras so he can help his family recover from Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ricardo Reyes could be deported , the U.S. Department
of Immigration and Naturalization Services has stopped deporting
all Central Americans until at least January. The agency took the
action last month to spare Central America the burden of absorbing
more people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the United States passed this rule because they are
trying to help,'' Reyes, 22, said in a telephone interview Tuesday.
``But there is no way I can help my family by sitting in
detention.''
</P>
<P>
   Reyes is one of 12 Central Americans in custody at Krome
Detention Center near Miami who began a hunger strike last week to
protest the INS rule. Ten of the detainees ended their fast Monday,
but Reyes and a Nicaraguan, Noel Balladares, 35, were still
refusing food Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes is in detention because he was convicted of burglary of a
Lake Worth home in 1995. He said he served three years in prison
and has been at the Krome camp for three months.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes and Balladares are being monitored by nurses and will be
given forced, intravenous feeding if the hunger strike becomes
life-threatening, said Dan Kane, an INS spokesman at Krome.
</P>
<P>
   Balladares said he won't start eating again until he is given a
promise of release.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be deported,'' Balladares said. ``My whole family is
in Nicaragua and my mother is very sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Kane said 12 of the 55 Central Americans at Krome have been
freed so they could find jobs and send money back to their
homeland. The 43 others have felony convictions and are not
eligible for release.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel they are living in a state of limbo here,'' Kane
said. ``They want to go back to their country.''

 &HT;    Prison system scoured for weapons, contraband
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Concerned about an increase in the discovery of
contraband, some of it linked to gang activity and other security
threats, Texas prison officials conducted a rare ``shakedown'' of
the entire prison system to check for weapons and other contraband,
a prison spokes- man said Tuesday. ``We have seen a consistent
increase in contraband and weapons in recent weeks and a real or
perceived increase in some gang activity, and this is how we're
dealing with that,'' said Larry Todd, a spokesman for the Texas
Department of Criminal Justice, which operates the system of
prisons, state jails and substance-abuse treatment units.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, we've found a lot of contraband like homemade
cigarettes and cash money, and we've also found one shank (a
knifelike piece of sharpened metal),'' Todd said. ``All of those
things are absolutely prohibited.''
</P>
<P>
   Also being seized were ``fishing lines,'' long poles made out of
rolled-up paper that gang members use to pass messages through
their cell bars at some prisons, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inmates are not happy about this, but this is a prison system,
not a hotel chain,'' Todd said. ``We didn't ask their permission.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said 80 state prisons and 26 drug-treatment centers
and state jails for nonviolent offenders were involved in the
so-called ``lockdown'' that began Monday. All convicts were
confined to their cells and all work programs, prison factories and
other activities were suspended. Guards were conducting searches of
most of the 144,000 convicts and their cells.
</P>
<P>
   By late Tuesday, officials said the searches had been completed
at more than half of Texas prisons. ``Most units will be cleared by
(today) _ or Friday at the latest at some of the largest units,''
Todd said.
</P>
<P>
   While wardens routinely order temporary lockdowns to deal with
problems on cellblocks or occasion- ally lock down an entire
prison, Todd and other prison officials said it has been years
since a systemwide lockdown was ordered. The most notable such
lockdown of the entire prison system occurred in the mid-1980s when
warring prison gangs went on a months-long spree of murders and
violence, leaving guards little able to control Texas'
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   For months, prison officials have been warning that the growing
influence of prison gangs _ both inside prisons and on the streets
_ poses a new threat to prison security and public safety.
</P>
<P>
   But Todd said gang problems alone are not the cause of the
latest lockdown.
</P>
<P>
   It was also not caused by the recent escape of convicted killer
Martin Gurule from death row at the Ellis prison unit outside
Huntsville. Gurule, who died after escaping, was the only one of
seven death row prisoners to make it out of the maximum-security
unit in Texas' largest such breakout attempt in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are using this systemwide lockdown as a management tool to
ensure that we clean out all contraband before our heaviest
visitation period of the year begins at the end of this week _ for
Christmas,'' Todd said. ``We're anticipating more free world
visitors at our units during the next two weekends.''

 &HT;    Five cities chosen for poverty project
 &HT;    By Jim Bebbington
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The city of Dayton is joining four other cities
to share ideas and work on projects to move people from poverty to
well-paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Staff from the National League of Cities will consult with
officials in Dayton; Flint, Mich.; Oklahoma City; Pasadena and
Modesto, Calif. during the two-year project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been working diligently to aid our residents in moving
off the welfare rolls and into living-wage jobs,'' said city
commission member Idotha Bootsie Neal.
</P>
<P>
   The joint effort is funded through grants made to the league of
cities.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Valley's experiences with projects such as the Job
Center and the effort to consolidate training for the tool and die
industry are expected to be part of the region's contribution to
the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the (other cities) may have done some innovative
public employment programs, innovative things helping women and
minorities entering the skilled trade,'' said Kathy Emery, manager
of the division of community affairs. ``We hopefully will learn
from the other cities.''

UN INSPECTION TEAM TO CITE IRAQ'S LATEST INTERFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The UN's chief weapons inspector has concluded
Iraq has consistently obstructed teams seeking to eliminate its
most lethal weapons, fueling the possibility of US-British air
strikes against Baghdad, according to diplomats Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration said Tuesday that it is awaiting the
release of Richard Butler's report, which was turned over to
Secretary General Kofi Annan Tuesday night, before deciding whether
to use military force against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   However, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said: ``We don't have
to wait for the report to know that Iraq's cooperation was less
than full and unconditional.''
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 14, with bombers already in the air, President Clinton
called off an air strike on the condition that Iraq would honor its
promise to resume full cooperation with the weapons inspectors.
Washington and London have said military strikes remain an option
to compel Baghdad to cooperate with inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Since Clinton called off the bombing raid, Iraq has repeatedly
blocked the UN inspectors. The Iraqis have prevented the inspectors
from conducting unannounced searches of a number of sites,
including the political headquarters of the country's ruling Baath
Party and a rebel camp housing Iranian guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Baghdad blocked a team of chemical weapons experts
because Friday was a Muslim holy day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The facts are clear. This is not full cooperation,'' said one
European diplomat familiar with the report, who spoke on condition
of anonymity. He and a senior UN official say the Iraqis also have
harassed the inspectors by buzzing them with a helicopter and
turning over one of 12 key documents requested by Butler, the
Australian who leads the UN Special Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the US force that has remained in the Persian
Gulf has been placed on alert for possible acts of terrorism
following ``significant'' reports of an attack against American
servicemen, diplomats and civilians, said Bacon, the Pentagon
spokesman. Bacon said 24,100 military personnel remain in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Any American calculation on the use of force will have to take
into account the beginning of the Muslim religious holiday Ramadan,
which begins on Friday and lasts for a month. Observers say that
leaves American military planners with the option of striking in
the coming days or waiting until after the New Year.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Iraq released its own report of the UN inspections
of Iraq. It accused the UN inspectors of conducting intentionally
``provocative'' searches, ignoring previous agreements to take
special precautions when inspecting politically sensitive sites.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq said that its own detailed analysis of inspections Monday
demonstrated that the UN teams ``were able to interview all
individuals required and to reach all the sites they wished to
inspect.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether Butler's report would undermine Iraqi
attempts to get the Security Council to conduct a comprehensive
review of its relationship with the United Nations _ a step that
Baghdad hoped would lead to an end to eight years of economic
sanctions. US Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said last
week that Baghdad's intransigence was hurting its chances for such
relief.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to prevent another military confrontation, the UN
chief urged the Clinton Administration to let Iraq begin the review
process even if Butler rules that Baghdad has not fulfilled its
obligations.
</P>
<P>
   Annan appears to have been moved by Iraqi charges that Butler
has been provocative in his dealings with Baghdad, accusing him on
Monday of practicing ``megaphone diplomacy.'' ``I know that his
language, which sometimes is undiplomatic, has irritated many
people around the world and I have discussed this with him,'' Annan
said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Annan will study the report and turn it over to the UN Security
Council. Previous reports then have been made public.
</P>
<P>
   US officials, while privately annoyed by Butler's blunt public
diplomacy, has publicly defended him from the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Butler has done an excellent job under difficult
circumstances,'' said White House foreign policy spokesman David
Leavy. ``The Iraqis have lied, cheated and concealed at every turn.
Anybody, whether it's Richard Butler or Mother Teresa, is going to
clash with the Iraqis.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Trevan, a former adviser to Butler's predecessor, Rolf
Ekeus, said Butler is not the problem. He said that Iraq has sought
for years to impugn the reputations of UN Special Commission
leadership. ``The fact of the matter is it doesn't matter whether
it is Richard or not. They tried very hard to assassinate Ekeus'
character.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission has inspected Iraq since Baghdad agreed to
destroy its weapons of mass destruction as a condition for ending
the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the 1991 cease-fire agreement ending the Gulf
War, Baghdad is obliged to destroy its long-range missiles and all
of its nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. The last
diplomatic confrontation ignited on Oct. 31, when Iraq announced
that it would no longer cooperate with the United Nations, an
action it renounced two weeks later under threat of attack.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the spirit of the Christmas lyric _ ``Let
nothing you dismay'' _ the office of Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill.,
chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, has scheduled the
committee's holiday party at the very time on Thursday when his
fateful resolution to impeach President Clinton is scheduled to be
debated by the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should do wonders for holiday cheer,'' commented Rep. Bill
Delahunt, D-Mass., a committee member who was offended, like other
Democrats, at the coincidence of wassailing and impeaching on such
a momentous day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people will be in a very festive mood,'' a
member of Hyde's staff conceded, in commenting on the faxed
invitations sliding into invitees' offices across Capitol Hill amid
a continuing avalanche of constituents' views on impeachment:
``Holiday Party! Chairman Hyde invites you to join in celebrating
the holiday season.'' As questions were raised about the party, the
staff member hurried to add, ``It could very well be canceled.''
</P>
<P>
   Capitol Hill seemed far removed Tuesday from any wisp of holiday
spirit _ whether Christmas, Hanukkah or, for that matter,
Saturnalia, Rome's ancient December feast of unrestrained merriment
in the face of life's mortal defeats.
</P>
<P>
   Two days from the opening of the impeachment debate, gangs of
television crews moved through mostly deserted corridors on their
appointed rounds, doling out their 15 minutes of fame as individual
congressman stepped up to batteries of microphones. Bathed in
individual attention, they shed the status of being formally
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a complicated decision. The president chose to make
it that way,'' said Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., coming out for
impeachment. He spoke in a small office stuffed with 15 TV cameras
and a horde of news workers _ a raucously crammed tableau more out
of the Marx Brothers' ``A Night at the Opera'' than Allen Drury's
``Advise and Consent.''
</P>
<P>
   Rumors were rampant that Clinton would, nay must, attempt some
last-minute stratagem, appeal or even personal visit to save
himself from impeachment. Outside Campbell's office, a few House
aides gossipped, estimating Clinton's case was lost. ``I hear
Clinton will do another `I-apologize' when he gets off the plane
from Israel,'' said one gloomy Democratic staffer. ``That will only
put this thing over the top and kill him.''
</P>
<P>
   As sound bites and photo-ops tattooed the city, the anticipation
of history _frenzied one minute, enervating the next _ seemed to be
burying any promise of holiday festivity on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Franken, a CNN correspondent who has stood and talked
through all four seasons of the sex-and-mendacity scandal, from
courthouse to Capitol, was competing in his noon report with more
than MSNBC. A boombox blasted out ``Oh Tannenbaum'' from the
Capitol's east staircase behind him as he was trying to address his
camera on the Capitol lawn. (``There are two ways of looking at
this ... '')
</P>
<P>
   The music pealed forth incongruously from Rita Warren's annual
Christmas creche of life-sized statues that she has set up for the
past 19 years on the steps, a ritual in celebration of her First
Amendment rights as much as the Almighty. ``I expect a lot of
coming and going here Thursday,'' Mrs. Warren said warily, standing
between the three kings and the Senate. ``But I've got my permit
and I'm not moving.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Capitol, a few tourists paused in a Senate corridor
at a history display entitled ``Rich, Rare and Racy.'' But it was
not another burst of this-just-in. It displayed the 19th century
diaries of the Senate's gentlemanly doorkeeper, Isaac Bassett,
jottings hilariously and mercifully more tepid than Linda Tripp's
furtive tapings a century later.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, intense battles were under way over the shape
of history Thursday. Democrats were intent on extending the
impeachment debate beyond a single day. News photographers were
furious that they would not be allowed to record the scene Thursday
for the nation. As usual, the only graphic coverage will be the
in-house television cameras that have limited leeway under
leadership rules designed to display civics more than the
cut-and-thrust of politics.
</P>
<P>
   Outside in the late afternoon sun, Rep. W.J. ``Billy'' Tauzin,
R-La., offered the president just a sliver of comfort at a news
conference by noting that he remained undecided. But he was
pessimistic about Clinton's ability to prevail in the House. ``The
people want some consequences for it,'' he said in frustration at
the president's misbehavior.
</P>
<P>
   Down at the White House, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., who
sparked a storm of criticism of Clinton last September in terming
the president's behavior ``disgraceful'' and ``immoral,'' emerged
from a meeting. ``Honestly, I didn't think we'd be here,'' he said,
looking as surprised as anyone else in the city.

   STEPHENVILLE, Texas _ Stephenville's run to a third championship
game berth has provided a glimpse of the current Yellow Jackets'
instinctual capability to strike when backed into a corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nasty,'' was how one observer described Stephenville's
quick-strike ability last Saturday in a 31-28 semifinal victory
against Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   Stephenville (14-1) meets three-time defending state champion La
Marque (13-0) at 4 p.m. Saturday at Texas Stadium in Irving for the
Class 4A Division II championship.
</P>
<P>
   As effortless as Stephenville's five-week run has appeared, the
pressure-filled moments were similarly evident. Despite averaging
40.1 points in the playoffs, potential land mines existed.
</P>
<P>
   Against Andrews, then the state's No. 3-ranked team,
Stephenville trailed, 21-17, at halftime but overcame buzz-saw
running back Shaud Williams' 275 rushing yards to win a 41-35
thriller.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks later, upset-minded Wichita Falls Hirschi threw two
100-yard rushers at the Jackets. Leading, 21-14, Stephenville
needed halftime adjustments to pull away and win, 42-21.
</P>
<P>
   Neither night compared to Saturday's extravaganza against
Carroll, after which Stephenville's offense and defense both
deserved game balls. Stephenville scored the winning touchdown with
1:04 to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got together and had to get our strength together,''
linebacker Keith McCormick said. ``It was time for all the work
we've done in the weight room to pay off.''
</P>
<P>
   McCormick tackled Carroll running back Clay McNutt six inches
short of a first down on fourth-and-three to force a change of
possession. One drive before, Carroll had sacked Stephenville
quarterback Kelan Luker on fourth down to take possession.
</P>
<P>
   But Carroll couldn't protect its 28-24 lead, and Luker did his
defense one better, throwing the game-winning 52-yard score to Cody
Cardwell. The latter left a trail of Carroll cover men slamming
fists on the Texas Stadium carpet.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, even Stephenville had to ``find a way'' sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   Most offenses, Luker pointed out, need more time and less
distance to engineer winning drives than Stephenville needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can score from the 10 \Rin multiple plays\S or in one
play,'' Luker said. ``It doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the pressure Stephenville endured against Carroll was
self-inflicted. Gambling on fourth-and-17 from its own 35,
Stephenville hoped to convert or gain enough yards to put the game
in its defense's hands.
</P>
<P>
   The play lost nine yards on the Luker sack to set Carroll up at
the Jackets' 26. Feeling it needed more than a seven-point lead,
Carroll passed up a field-goal attempt and was stopped on downs
when McCormick tackled McNutt.
</P>
<P>
   Stephenville took over needing to cover 83 yards in 1:33 to win.
Had Stephenville punted earlier and then forced a Carroll punt, the
Jackets' final field position would have been similar, coach Art
Briles said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never really know what's right or wrong in those
situations,'' Briles said. ``We might have made the first down and
kept it going. If our defense got on the field, we had two timeouts
and we could hold them and get it back.''
</P>
<P>
   The winning drive was as unexpected as it was sudden, McCormick
said. ``We knew it would be an offensive battle,'' he said. ``But
to have it come down to the defense at the end the way it did, I
just didn't expect that.''

PROSPECTS DIM FOR RETURNING PRESIDENT

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton returned Tuesday night from the
Middle East to the fight of his political life and to dimming
prospects that he will avoid impeachment by the full House this
week.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said Clinton is prepared to take whatever
steps were necessary to save his embattled presidency. But they
said two things were off the table: He will not resign or admit
that he lied under oath, as some Republicans have insisted.
</P>
<P>
   As a steady stream of moderate Republicans Tuesday added their
voices to the chorus of ``yes'' votes on impeachment, disappointed
White House aides struggled to staunch their panic and devise a
strategy for swaying the dwindling number of undecided lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite so little to cheer about, White House aides said they
had not thrown in the towel and thought Clinton still has a chance
to avoid impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It think there's still hope lingering around this place,''
said one administration official. ``But I don't think anybody is
going to bet their life's earnings'' that Clinton will not be
impeached.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are realistic, but we have not given up hope,'' said a
senior White House official. ``We are going to fight it out to the
end.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to meet Wednesday with as many as a dozen
moderate Republicans, led by Representative Christopher Shays of
Connecticut, who originally planned to vote for impeachment but has
grown wobbly on the subject in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   But Shays and his Republican colleagues may be disappointed if
they are waiting for a public admission by the president that he
lied in his Aug. 17 grand jury testimony about his sexual
relationship with former White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky and
a January deposition in the now-settled Paula Jones sexual
harassment case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will do a lot to resolve this, but two things we won't do:
One is to admit to doing something he says he didn't do and, two,
he won't resign,'' said the senior White House official.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a Democratic from Connecticut,
echoed those sentiments as he left the White House Tuesday, saying
he was unsure it would help Clinton even if he did admit to lying
under oath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the response of the Republicans in the House
would be if the president admitted to the behavior that they'd like
him to admit to,'' Lieberman told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a lot on the line here, his presidency and his history,
they are asking a lot and it's not clear what will be offered in
return,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although some administration officials fear that independent
Kenneth W. Starr might try to prosecute Clinton for perjury when he
leaves office in 2001, that may not be the president's paramount
worry.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials said the biggest concern is he would lose support
among House Democrats who have clung to the same legal technicality
as Clinton to defend their opposition to impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he makes such an admission, it makes the vote more
difficult not less,'' said Ann Lewis, the White House
communications director.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question of whether to impeach should be based on whether
his act met the constitutional standard, not whether people did or
didn't like the speech he gave,'' she added. In a Rose Garden
statement on Friday, Clinton apologized for putting the country
through the Lewinsky ordeal but stopped short of admitting he lied,
angering many moderate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's former Labor secretary, Robert B. Reich, said the
president was not admitting to pejury because he also has ``one eye
on the history books.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If he were to confess to having perjured himself, the
admission of outright perjury to a grand jury may be the greater
offense in the eyes of future historians than being impeached by a
Republican Congress,'' said Reich, who now teaches at Brandeis
University.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is getting no shortage of advice on what he should do,
as a broad array of aides and outside advisers have chimed in.
Several have urged him not to go before the American people with a
confession, saying it's now too late.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton aides, instead, seized on a flicker of good news _
proposals by two Republicans to censure the president, raising
hopes that a bipartisan solution can still be found.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Michael Castle, an undecided Republican from
Delaware, wrote the GOP leadership urging a toughly worded censure
resolution. The resolution would require Clinton to pay at least $2
million in restitution to cover part of the cost of Starr's
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Clinton's 1996 Republican presidential opponent,
Bob Dole, proposed in a New York Times opinion column that Congress
move expeditiously to approve a joint resolution of censure by the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are thoughtful and serious proposals,'' said James
Kennedy, a spokesman for the White House special counsel. ``While
we haven't endorsed any specific plan, we welcome efforts to find a
bipartisan solution that will allow us to put this behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   Some White House aides are urging the president to focus
directly or indirectly on wavering House Republicans and Democrats,
though they leave open the possibility Clinton may offer some
public comment before the House impeachment debate begins Thurdsay.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, however, said Clinton ``should follow his own
instincts and his own conscience. This is, you know, an
unprecedented moment. But this president's been through an awful
lot in his life, and he seems to always find reserves of
strength,'' Lieberman added. ``So he is going to be tested in the
next few days.''

REPUBLICANS FALL IN LINE, MAKING IMPEACHMENT A NEAR CERTAINTY
</HEADLINE>
   (htv) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER and ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton was returning to Washington
Tuesday night facing the near certainty that the House of
Representatives will vote to impeach him later this week unless he
can find some dramatic means to reverse the Republican tide running
against him.
</P>
<P>
   The almost insurmountable problems facing the president became
clear Tuesday as several previously undeclared Republicans
announced that they would vote in favor impeachment on one or more
of the four counts against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The blows came one by one by one throughout the day, as if
choreographed. And on Tuesday it was not the Republicans considered
longshots by the White House who proclaimed their intention to vote
against the president. Rather, the White House lost Republicans who
were considered as possible opponents of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The hemorrhaging of support left the White House pondering
several desperate and unappealing options Tuesday night. All had
their proponents in the White House and in Clinton's circle of
outside advisers. But none of these advisers expressed confidence
that any words or actions by the president could reverse the
momentum at this point.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the situation was still in flux Tuesday evening,
but the president was planning to meet with Rep. Christopher Shays
of Connecticut and other undecided Republicans individually in an
attempt to craft a tough censure option including a fine and an
admission of wrongdoing to keep the last Republicans from
defecting.
</P>
<P>
   But the Democrats said it would be difficult to persuade Clinton
to make a confession of perjury and other offenses that Republicans
are demanding. Clinton has insisted in public that he did not lie
under oath and does not believe he committed perjury.
</P>
<P>
   White House advisers also said the president is weighing an
appeal to the public in a televised address, not to sway Republican
votes but to awaken the public to the stakes and to paint the
impeachment drive as a partisan effort to undo the result of two
national elections. Such a speech would most likely be delivered
only after it was clear that Clinton did not have the votes to
defeat an impeachment resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The White House was also studying two new proposals for an
alternative punishment short of impeachment, one from former Sen.
Bob Dole, the other from Rep. Michael N. Castle, Republican of
Delaware. Both require forthright admissions of wrongdoing by the
president; Castle's proposal also would have Clinton pay a $2
million fine to help cover the cost of the Monica Lewinsky
investigation that formed the basis of the four impeachment
charges.
</P>
<P>
   The most damaging announcement for Clinton came from
Representative Jack Quinn of New York, who for weeks had said that
he would oppose impeachment. On Tuesday he said he had changed his
mind after studying the evidence against the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more I learn about the serious details of perjury and
obstruction of justice, the more I am concerned about the
President's failure to tell the truth under oath,'' Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
   With the Republican announcements Tuesday, the mathematical
possibilities of avoiding impeachment became as unlikely as drawing
an inside card to a royal flush. To prevent 218 votes' being cast
to impeach the president, he would need to win over nearly all the
18 undecided Republicans and hold the support of almost every
Democrat who is wavering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something has to happen to change the dynamic,'' said one
Democrat. ``The math gets tough from here on out. You've got to
walk this back.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Campbell, a California Republican who came out against
Clinton on Tuesday, said, ``It is my judgment that the president
will be impeached by the House of Representatives.''

 &HT;    President ponders appeal to undecided members of Congress
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman and Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton headed home Tuesday night to an
increasingly grim political situation made worse by the decision of
several moderate Republicans to support his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said the president is considering whether he
could make a dramatic, last-minute appeal that would include an
explicit admission of wrongdoing to avoid impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The targets of such a statement would be the dwindling number of
uncommitted Republicans. Democrats estimate that roughly 15
Republicans would have to vote against impeachment to spare Clinton
the infamy of becoming the second U.S. president to be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee released the
introduction to their report, which will provide the foundation for
four articles of impeachment against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has disgraced himself and the high office he holds. His
high crimes and misdemeanors undermine our Constitution,'' the
introduction reads. ``They warrant his impeachment, his removal
from office, and his disqualification from holding further
office.''
</P>
<P>
   Returning from a three-day trip to the Middle East, Clinton is
scheduled to meet at the White House today with Rep. Christopher
Shays, a Connecticut Republican who said his early opposition to
impeachment has been shaken by the president's unwillingness to say
he lied about his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats and Republicans will meet today in closed-door
party caucuses to discuss strategy for Thursday's momentous,
televised debate in the House chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are trying to devise a way procedurally to allow the
House to vote on a censure, a formal denunciation of Clinton, that
appears to have broad support among Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Among the few pieces of good news for the White House Tuesday
was a proposal by Republican Rep. Michael Castle of Delaware for
Clinton to make a $2 million payment and accept a toughly worded
censure resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even at this late date, there are compelling reasons to pursue
a different course with a better solution for our nation,'' Castle
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Robert Livingston (R-La.), the incoming speaker of the
House, restated his opposition to censure as an unconstitutional
means of rebuking Clinton. Censure and other forms of punishment
are ``issues for the Senate to determine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston said he expects party loyalty to prevail on the
procedural votes Democrats may try to force the censure option to
the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders representing more than a dozen women's organizations
rallied to Clinton's defense Tuesday and then met briefly with
Livingston to urge a censure vote.
</P>
<P>
   But Livingston rebuffed the request, telling the women that he
believed Clinton's alleged transgressions were worse than those
committed by President Nixon, said Kim Grandy, executive vice
president of the National Organization of Women.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Watergate, Nixon didn't do anything,'' Grandy said
Livingston told the group. ``He just covered up for the people that
did. Clinton did everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Corallo, a Livingston spokesman, denied that Livingston
characterized Clinton's misdeeds as worse than Nixon's.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day at a news conference, Grandy and leaders of
other women's groups warned moderate Republicans to respect the
wishes of the majority of the country and censure, rather than
impeach Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if he did what is alleged, what's the big deal?'' said
feminist author Betty Friedan. ``It doesn't threaten the
government. . . . Where's the sense of proportion?''
</P>
<P>
   ``To have our will overthrown by a bunch of dirty old white men
. . . is really a disgrace,'' Friedan said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same news conference, AFL-CIO executive vice president
Linda Chavez-Thompson said the powerful labor union was urging
volunteers to lobby members of Congress against impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for the Republican House leadership to stop playing
politics and get back to work on issues that are important to
average families,'' Chavez-Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   But the moderate Republicans who spoke out Tuesday largely
ignored the women's warnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I conclude that the president intentionally, on more than one
occasion, did not tell the truth in a federal criminal grand jury.
That is very serious. That is impeachable,'' Rep. Tom Campbell
(R-Calif.) said at a news conference on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Johnson (R-Conn.) said, ``No one is above the law,
not even the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Several other moderates who the White House hoped would vote
against impeachment instead announced their support for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   They include three New Yorkers: Michael Forbes, Sue Kelly and
John McHugh.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also lost a Republican vote Tuesday when Rep. Jack
Quinn, another New Yorker, reversed course and said he would vote
for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans who joined the pro-impeachment ranks included
Reps. Gil Gutknecht of Minnesota, Jim McCrery of Louisiana, Roy
Blunt of Missouri, Anne Northup of Kentucky and Herbert Bateman of
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said he would support each of the four articles of
impeachment that accuse Clinton of perjury, obstruction of justice
and abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is anything more that the president or the
White House can do on this issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether enough members remain undecided to give Clinton a way
out of impeachment is anyone's guess, although Democrats insisted
Tuesday the fight has not been lost.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston also predicted the votes would be close.
</P>
<P>
   An Associated Press telephone survey of House members found 150
lawmakers said they would support impeachment, 163 said they would
oppose it, 88 remained undecided, and 34 wouldn't answer or didn't
return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   The urgency of the situation was clear at the White House, where
Vice President Al Gore cancelled a trip to New Hampshire and
Clinton chief of staff John Podesta met with House Democrats to
discuss strategy.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Barry Toiv said Clinton aides were still
searching for a bipartisan compromise. But he also criticized House
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The partisan nature of this becomes clear with each member who
steps up to the microphone to make their announcement,'' Toiv said.
</P>
<P>
   Former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole suggested a way to avoid
a lengthy trial in the Senate, assuming Clinton is impeached.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, who lost the 1996 presidential election to Clinton, said
Congress should vote to censure Clinton and force the president to
sign the censure document in the presence of national leaders,
including the vice president, members of the Cabinet, congressional
leaders and members of the Supreme Court.

 &HT;    Lawmaker proposes more frequent testing of TAAS
 &HT;    By A. Phillips Brooks
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas students will be required to take the
state achievement exam nearly every year, beginning in the third
grade, and will have to pass a tougher exit exam to graduate, under
a bill Senate Education Chairman Teel Bivins said he will file this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Bivins' bill aims to raise the educational stakes for students
and schools in the wake of dramatic gains on the state achievement
test. This year, a record 77 percent of students passed the Texas
Assessment of Academic Skills, up from 55 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas has proved that setting standards and asking students to
achieve works,'' said Bivins, R-Amarillo. ``But we cannot rest on
our laurels. It is now time to raise the bar.''
</P>
<P>
   The bar goes up, starting in school year 2002-03, under Bivins'
proposal. For the first time, ninth-graders would be tested and
science and social studies _ currently not included on the exam _
would be added to TAAS tests at various grade levels. A new exit
level TAAS would be created for 11th-graders, who currently are not
tested unless they fail the 10th-grade exit TAAS.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, students in grades three through eight take the TAAS,
which measures basic skills in reading, writing and mathematics.
Tenth-graders take an exit TAAS, which they must pass by the time
they graduate to receive their diplomas.
</P>
<P>
   Bivins' bill closely resembles a proposal announced two weeks
ago by Texas Education Commissioner Mike Moses. About 600,000 new
students would be assessed under Moses' plan. It was not known how
many new students would be tested under Bivins' proposal.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 1.9 million students took the TAAS. Texas, with the
nation's second-largest enrollment, has about 3.9 million
schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Bivins said his plan would cost about $50 million a year. Moses'
proposal is more expensive, about $102 million a year, because he
wants to include cash bonuses for teachers whose students fare well
on the TAAS. That component would cost about $55 million. When that
is subtracted, the two plans cost about the same.
</P>
<P>
   Several teachers groups welcomed Bivins' plan, just as they
complimented the one offered by Moses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've said for some time the TAAS was too narrow a measure of
the curriculum and broadening the test to cover more of the
curriculum will reduce teaching to test,'' said John O'Sullivan, a
spokesman for the Texas Federation of Teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly favor moving (the exit TAAS) to grade 11 and
expanding the test to cover more of the curriculum,'' said Larry
Comer, a spokesman for the Association of Texas Professional
Educators.
</P>
<P>
   Bivins said his bill delays using scores of new students in
grades 9 and 11 and science and social studies TAAS exams in the
state accountability system, which annually ranks individual school
districts and campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Those scores will be phased into the accountability system after
a few years, Bivins said. The accountability system annually grades
schools and districts as ``exemplary,'' ``recognized,''
``acceptable'' or ``low-performing,'' based largely on how well
students perform on TAAS tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my goal to make sure that students, parents, teachers,
schools and districts have plenty of lead time and no surprises,''
Bivins said.

BC STAR CLOUD VOTED TO AP FIRST-TEAM OFFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The accolades continue to pour in for Mike Cloud.
</P>
<P>
   After being recognized as a first-team All-America selection by
the Football Writers Association of America and the American
Football Coaches Association, the Boston College senior running
back made yet another honor roll Tuesday when he was voted to the
Associated Press All-America first-team offense.
</P>
<P>
   Cloud, a 5-foot-11-inch, 201-pounder from Portsmouth, R.I., who
despite falling short of his goal of 2,000 yards this season became
BC's all-time leading career rusher (3,597 yards) and established
Big East season records for attempts (308) and yards (1,772), was
the only conference player to make first-team honors. He joined
Heisman Trophy-winning running back Ricky Williams of Texas and
UCLA quarterback Cade McNown in the AP's All-America backfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really exciting,'' said Cloud. ``I got the first message
over the Thanksgiving break that I had made (the Football Writers)
All-America team, and I thought they were playing a joke on me. I
was really surprised. But it all started way back last summer.
That's when I began working out about a year ago to get ready for
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just thrilled because all the hard work paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach BC coach Tom O'Brien, who was on the road
recruiting, were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Cloud becomes the eighth BC player overall, and the first Eagles
running back since Mike Holovak in 1942, to be named a consensus
All-American. The last time the Eagles landed a player on the AP
first-team offense was in 1994 when tight end Pete Mitchell, now
with the Jacksonville Jaguars, made it.
</P>
<P>
   As his spoils, Mitchell joined the rest of the AP All-America
team in California to tape a segment for Bob Hope's Christmas
special, which, as it turned out, was the last for the aging
entertainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember that,'' Cloud said. ``I remember watching Pete on
that show. Too bad it was Bob Hope's last time. It would've been
nice to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Cloud said he met with Williams during ESPN's college football
awards show earlier this month in Orlando, Fla. Both were up for
the Doak Walker Award as the nation's top running back, which
Williams won. ``He was a real classy guy,'' Cloud said. ``That's
the way all the guys were down there, but everyone knew he was
going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Cloud provided the Eagles with the only silver lining in their
4-7 season by leading the Big East in rushing from box to finish.
He rushed for more than 100 yards 10 times, gaining a season-high
200 in a 41-31 season-opening victory Sept. 5 at Georgia Tech. He
wound up as the nation's No. 3 rusher, averaging 156.9 yards per
game (another Big East record).
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the credit goes to the offensive line, definitely,''
Cloud said. ``Guys like (Doug) Brzezinski, (Damien) Woody, (Dan)
Collins, and (Mike) Cook, and all the others _ they were the ones
who made it possible. They did a great job in pass protection and
they opened up a lot of big holes for me.''
</P>
<P>
   What will be his fondest memories of his senior year?
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess breaking the record with that touchdown run against
West Virginia,'' Cloud said, referring to the 21-yard jaunt that
helped him surpass Troy Stradford (3,509 yards, 1982-'86) as BC's
rushing leader.
</P>
<P>
   As for the not so fond memories, he said, ``Coming so close in
the Notre Dame and Virginia Tech games'' _ he was stuffed at the
goal line in both losses _ ``those games will stick in my mind for
a long time, but hopefully, I'll be able to erase them soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Cloud will not participate in the Blue-Gray All-Star Game
Christmas Day but instead will focus on the Senior Bowl Jan. 22 in
Mobile, Ala., where he hopes to make an impression on the numerous
NFL scouts in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that, I'll get ready for the (NFL scouting) combine,''
he said. ``My goal is to go back there and do some things that no
tailback has ever done before at the combine. And you know me and
my lofty goals _ once I set my mind to do it, I try to go after
them.''

NO RETURN TO REPLAY THIS SEASON, NFL DECIDES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Instant replay will not be used to help NFL officials in the
playoffs this season.
</P>
<P>
   By a 7-1 vote, the Competition Committee Tuesday rejected a
proposal by commissioner Paul Tagliabue to use instant replay to
help the beleaguered officials in postseason play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spoke with the committee (before the vote) and outlined the
pros and cons of it after speaking with all of the clubs across the
league,'' said Tagliabue. ``Everyone on the (conference) call
recognized the advantages to using it in a given game to have the
(officiating) crew look at replay, but they were against making the
change for postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry Jones (the Dallas owner) was for it, but the rest were
against it, even though they voted, 6-2, in favor of having some
kind of instant replay for regular-season and postseason games in
1999.''
</P>
<P>
   So there will be no replay this season.
</P>
<P>
   But Tagliabue said most involved want the system back for the
start of the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have to do now,'' he said, ``is put together a system
that most all teams will be in favor of.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Tagliabue, the people on the conference call agreed
that the Competition Committee should come up with a system that it
will highly endorse to all the teams at the annual NFL meeting in
Phoenix next March.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pointed out to the members of the committee that with the
new technology on television, it is becoming more and more
difficult to officiate these games,'' said Tagliabue. ``I pointed
out to them that the greatest players in the game make mistakes
each week and officials are going to make mistakes each week. Our
officating is good. We have just had some bad calls on some
high-profile plays recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim Tunney (former game official) told me last week that the
expectations for officials in our league are just too high. What I
hope we can do is use the technology now available to help in the
future.''

Africa, according to the United Nations. On a continent where death
has always been a communal rather than a private matter, poverty
and emotional exhaustion are taking their toll. The poorest go
unshrouded into a common pit. Thousands of graves are left with no
markers grander than the favorite cup and spoon of the deceased,
smashed in loving memory of them. And people in all walks of life
shamefacedly confess that they no longer have the money or energy

   The historically momentous votes on articles of impeachment in
the House Judiciary Committee did not result in historically high
ratings for any television news outlet that was covering them,
though Saturday's final day of debate on the issue did produce a
slight increase in viewing for the all-news cable channels.
</P>
<P>
   CNN, for example, was seen on Saturday in about 1.3 million
households during an average minute, up slightly from the 1.1
million households that watched on Thursday and Friday. MSNBC also
had a modest increase in viewing, from about 240,000 homes to about
262,000 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But increased public interest in the push for impeachment was
not reflected in the ratings scored by any of the three network
newscasts last week. Two of the three, NBC and CBS, recorded lower
ratings than the week before, while ABC was up just one-tenth of a
ratings point. Overall, the three network newscasts lost about
280,000 homes last week from a week earlier.
</P>
<P>
   And a comparison to the same week one year ago, when Monica
Lewinsky's name was unknown to the American public, shows even
steeper declines. CBS' ratings are off 12 percent this year from
the same week a year ago; NBC's are off 10 percent, and ABC's
ratings are off 5 percent.

FORMER CIVIL RIGHTS CHIEF ACCEPTS TEXACO LEGAL POST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boston attorney Deval Patrick, formerly the nation's top civil
rights enforcer, is leaving his corporate law practice to join
Texaco Inc. as general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment, which Texaco said it plans to announce
Wednesday, could help the big oil company recover from embarrassing
revelations about its attitudes toward black employees.
</P>
<P>
   In taking the new job, Patrick, 42, said he will also step down
as chairman of a task force overseeing Texaco's progess in
improving its working environment for minorities. Some lawyers
familiar with Patrick's work on the task force questioned his
appointment as the company's general counsel, saying it could cast
doubt on the oversight group's independence.
</P>
<P>
   But Patrick said he consulted Charles Brieant, the federal judge
who presided over the Texaco case, and won his approval before
accepting the new post. In any case, Patrick said his new job will
build on the anti-discrimination work he has done lately in the
Boston office of the Hartford, Conn. law firm of Day, Berry &AMP;
Howard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked with a lot of corporations that are trying in good
faith not to turn into what Texaco once was. But few of those
companies have made the kind of progress that Texaco has made,''
Patrick said in an interview Tuesday. ``I'm not saying that Texaco
is the promised land. But they've taken this crisis as a platform
for change.''
</P>
<P>
   Conditions at Texaco have been under scrutiny since 1994, when a
group of black employees accused Texaco of racial discrimination in
a class-action lawsuit filed in Federal District Court for New
York's Southern District. Among other things the employees alleged
they were unfairly passed over for promotions because of their
race.
</P>
<P>
   The case received a boost in 1996 with the release of tapes of
Texaco executives making disparaging remarks about minorities. To
settle the matter, Texaco agreed when? to pay $176 million and to
promote minorities within the company.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-1997, Patrick was appointed to chair a seven-member task
force of outsiders to oversee Texaco's compliance with the terms of
the settlement. The company has made satisfactory progress,
according to the task force.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick said minorities and women now account for 70 percent of
Texaco's new hires and about half of promotions. He added that the
company has awarded more than $400 million in contracts to firms
owned by minorities and women. The target is $1 billion by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Before announcing the move, Patrick said he also received the
blessing of other task force members.
</P>
<P>
   John Gibbons, a retired federal appeals court judge in New
Jersey, who is a task force member, said Tuesday he had no
objection to Patrick's move. But added that ``now we'll be watching
him (Patrick) as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Texaco said Patrick will become the company's first black vice
president. As general counsel, Patrick replaces the retiring
Stephen M. Turner.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday, Texaco chairman and chief executive
Peter Bijur said Patrick became a candidate over the summer after
he asked the Boston attorney to review some resumes of candidates
who might replace Turner. Instead, Patrick himself expressed
interest. ``I don't care what he had done with the task force or
the Justice Department or what. I was interested in him because of
his management experience,'' Bijur said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some of Patrick's acquaintances say he probably shouldn't
have taken the new job while the task force's work continues.
</P>
<P>
   Boston civil rights attorney Margaret Burnham sees the move as
``a complete revolving door that raises questions about the
impartiality of any investigations'' done by the task force Patrick
oversaw. The move, she says, makes it more difficult for the public
to have confidence in Texaco's reform efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Merrick Rossein, an employment law specialist at the City
University of New York, said the change at least creates ``the
appearance of a conflict of interest'' for Patrick.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick says such concerns are moot because he has stepped down
from the oversight body.
</P>
<P>
   A Harvard Law School graduate who grew up on Chicago's tough
South Side, Patrick had become a partner at the Boston firm of Hill
&AMP; Barlow in 1994 when President Clinton named him assistant
attorney general for civil rights enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick was Clinton's second choice for the job after the
president withdrew his backing of a prior nominee, Lani Guinier,
who Republicans sharply criticized for her views of racial
preferences.
</P>
<P>
   Partly through the enforcement cases he brought, Patrick became
known as one of the administration's chief defenders of affirmative
action. When he left Washington in 1997, he cited a desire to spend
more time with his family in Milton.
</P>
<P>
   But instead he took on a heavy workload consulting on diversity
efforts at companies around the country and taking on teaching
stints at Harvard, Boston College and Stanford University. His
schedule will hardly be lighter at Texaco, where he will oversee a
legal staff of 80 at the company's White Plains, N.Y. headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Charles E. Walker Jr., a friend of Patrick's and chairman of the
Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, said the move
convinces him that Texaco is sincere in its diversity efforts.
Since 1994, he has avoided Texaco service stations, Walker says,
noting that that Patrick's new job ``makes me prepared to go back
there to buy gas.''

 WASHINGTON: of Representatives.''

<P>
   Shays, one of the last undecided Republican House members, is
scheduled to meet with Clinton at the White House on Wednesday.
Shays, a respected moderate, has said that he wants the president
to admit that he lied under oath and accept the legal consequences
of his acts.
</P>
<P>
   Shays is seen as the envoy of the dwindling band of undecided
moderate Republicans who are seeking some final admission from the
president before deciding on their impeachment votes. The White
House beseeched him to bring other undecided Republicans with him
for a session of presidential persuasion, but an official close to
Shays said, ``We're trying. We don't know the result. Chris is very
pessimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   With the time before the decisive House impeachment vote now
counted in hours, White House officials, in public at least,
continued to hold out hope that the tide could somehow turn in the
president's favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it over? Definitely not,'' said Paul Begala, presidential
counselor. ``No vote is certain until it is cast.''
</P>
<P>
   But private assessments were decidedly gloomy, alternating
between anger and a sense of foreboding about Thursday's
impeachment debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll lose,'' one senior adviser to the president
said. ``The real blow was Quinn. He's a very moderate Republican
who was always friendly to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Another adviser, who insisted on anonymity, said that no one at
the White House, from the president on down, had a strategy for
winning the impeachment fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is just at a loss for what it is you do,'' this adviser
said of the president. ``He took the advice to give a speech last
week and it didn't do him any good. He can't understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   The adviser continued glumly, ``My biggest fear is that there
will be a din for resignation after the vote. How do we stop
that?''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Republicans who declared themselves Tuesday were the
ones who had been expected to be Clinton's allies either because
they came from districts in the northeast that had voted for
Clinton, or because they sometimes cross party lines in their
voting. Four of them came from New York, the state that had been
expected to be a Clinton stronghold: Quinn, Michael P. Forbes, John
M. McHugh and Sue W. Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes had signaled to colleagues for weeks that he was going to
support the president. But on Tuesday he said he would vote to
impeach him on all four articles against him. ``I don't think there
is anything more that the president or the White House can do on
this issue,'' he said as he announced his position at a Capitol
news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of Campbell, a Stanford University law professor, was
another disappointment for the White House. He is a Republican who
has worked closely with Democrats on campaign finance overhaul and
he had opposed Newt Gingrich as Speaker when he faced his own
ethics controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell had been talking to two Cabinet officers for weeks
seeking some answers from the president that could sway him. But on
Tuesday, in an office crammed with television cameras and with his
voice occasionally trembling, Campbell said he had decided to vote
in favor impeachment based on Clinton's testimony before a federal
grand jury last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my belief that the president did not tell the truth on
several occasions before the federal criminal grand jury,'' he
said, ``having had seven months' advance notice, with his attorney
by his side, being able to stop the questioning at any point.''
</P>
<P>
   He said those lies also carried a fundamental cost in the world
of politics, where business is done with a handshake. ``If he would
not tell the truth under those circumstances, I do not know when I
can trust that he will tell the truth when it is to his political
advantage not to,'' he said. ``And that, in my judgment, seriously
incapacitates him in his abilities to carry out the duties of
president.''
</P>
<P>
   The others who came out for impeachment on Tuesday included:
Nancy L. Johnson of Connecticut, E. Clay Shaw, Jr. of Florida, Fred
Upton of Michigan, Gil Gutknecht of Minnesota, Jim McCrery of
Louisiana, Roy Blunt of Missouri and Anne M. Northup of Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that some of the members prepared to vote for
impeachment do not expect Clinton to be removed from office by the
Senate, Shaw, even as he announced Tuesday that he would vote for
impeachment, said he anticipated working with Clinton on
legislation next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my hope to reform Social Security with the help and
cooperation of President Clinton as we did in welfare reform,''
Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
   John D. Podesta, the White House chief of staff, journeyed to
the Capitol Tuesday afternoon to consult on the situation with Rep.
Dick Gephardt, the House Democratic leader. Democratic
vote-counters told him that there remained enough uncommitted
members to allow Clinton to escape impeachment. But they warned
that nearly all of them would have to decide for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats have 206 votes in the 105th Congress and there is
one independent who votes with them. They are counting on losing
only three to six Democrats in the impeachment vote. That means
that to prevail by just one vote, Clinton needs to draw 14 to 17
Republicans to his side. So far just four have said they are
supporting him or leaning toward supporting him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may be the last optimist at the White House,'' said one
senior presidential aide, ``but I'm not ready to say it's over in
the House. I still believe a majority of Congress opposes
impeachment and would welcome an opportunity to vote their
consciences.''
</P>
<P>
   This official said once again that Clinton had no intention of
resigning, even if the House votes to impeach him.

 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For weeks now, the small and besieged wing of the
Republican Party known as moderates has been huddling in hallways,
sharing conference calls and doing a lot of ``hand holding,'' as
one of their aides put it, to help each other decide how to vote on
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   So when one of their own, Rep. Jack Quinn, from Buffalo, N.Y.,
who is friendly with Clinton and who had been firmly against
impeachment, announced Tuesday morning that he now plans to vote
for it, a collective shudder went through the group.
</P>
<P>
   Before the day was done, at least eight other undecided
Republicans, several of them Northeastern moderates like Nancy
Johnson of Connecticut, and Michael Forbes and Sue Kelly of New
York, had joined the snowballing impeachment ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Though the moderates deny orchestrating their announcements,
there is little question that they have been sending each other
signals about how they would vote, quietly letting their fellow
centrists know that if they wanted to jump into the impeachment
abyss, they could jump together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once Quinn did it, I think that opened the floodgates for the
others,'' said Rep. Peter King, a Long Island Republican who has
been a leading opponent of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as another New York moderate Republican member of Congress
said, speaking on the condition of anonymity: ``You don't want to
be the one who tips it either way.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason that Republican moderates often act in concert has,
of course, much to do with the similar nature of their districts,
which tend to be heavily Democratic and supportive of labor unions,
abortion rights, environmental regulations _ and Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But the moderates also try to stick together because of their
marginal status in their own party, which is dominated by
conservatives from the South and West who tend to oppose them on
social, labor and environmental issues _ and who sorely want
Clinton impeached.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Republicans captured control of Congress in 1994, many
of the moderates have found themselves whipsawed between the
demands of their conservative congressional leaders and their more
centrist constituents. Impeachment presents the same conundrum:
Polls showed that Clinton remains popular in moderate swing
districts while impeachment is not.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden swing of moderates to the impeachment camp on Tuesday
_ there are still about 10 moderate Republicans who say they remain
undecided _ prompted Democrats to assert that the moderates had
been strong-armed by their party leadership and bullied by
Christian conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Several Democrats and a few Republicans said that Quinn had been
told by House leaders that he would lose his chairmanship of a
subcommittee and that Forbes had been pushed by the House
Speaker-elect, Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., to support impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn and Forbes denied such pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and political analysts also said that many of the
moderates may have feared primary challenges from conservative
candidates. Republican primaries tend to be dominated by
conservative voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spent much of the time since 1995 being disappointed by
the moderates' unwillingness to stand up to the right wing,'' said
Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass. ``And since then, I've just been
expecting it. The right wing dominates Republican primaries. And
they made it clear they would make an issue of this.''
</P>
<P>
   But several Republican moderates responded angrily to Franks'
remarks Tuesday, saying their decisions were made independently,
without pressure from their leaders and without consideration of
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me angry that Barney would demean the rest of us that
way,'' said Mrs. Johnson, who almost lost in the Clinton landslide
of 1996. ``This is not about politics, and it is not about sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Like several other undecided members who came out for
impeachment Tuesday, Mrs. Johnson said that what swayed her was the
belief that Clinton had perjured himself. ``Lying about marital
infidelity in private is not impeachable,'' she said. ``What has
made this of concern was his raising his right hand, swearing to
tell the whole truth and not telling the whole truth. There are
very few rights we give up in a democratic society, and one of
those is the right to lie under oath.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Though he says Livingston never asked him to vote for
impeachment, Forbes was clearly facing the kind of institutional
pressure that causes many members of Congress to follow their
leadership without being explicitly ordered to do so.
</P>
<P>
   An outcast among the House leadership for the past two years
because of his outspoken criticism of Newt Gingrich, the outgoing
Speaker, Forbes has suddenly gained influence because of his close
personal ties to Livingston. Several Republican officials said that
Forbes keenly understood that he would embarrass Livingston, who
has been criticized by conservatives for making Forbes part of his
inner circle, by voting against impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who suggested that he was against impeachment just a
week ago, said he was moved purely by moral considerations. ``What
do you tell your children about the highest elected official in the
land being allowed to lie under oath?'' he said. ``It's wrong to
say it doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans said the battle for the hearts and minds of
the moderates was lost when House leaders made clear they would
block any effort to censure Clinton, the preferred alternative for
many moderates.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a straight up or down vote on impeachment, many
moderates felt that they would have appeared to be not only defying
their leadership but also to be defending Clinton's behavior if
they voted no. Quinn and King, Republicans official said, were
accused by friends, family and constituents of endorsing immoral
behavior after they announced their opposition to impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   But the failure of many centrist Republicans to buck their
leadership on censure has dismayed not only Democrats but also some
Republicans, who contend that the moderates could be a powerful
force next year because the Republicans will hold just a six-vote
margin and the leadership will need their help passing bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just seemed to duck it,'' said King. ``They had the ideal
opportunity to assert themselves and didn't do it.''

JUDGE STRIKES DOWN CITY LAW BANNING CIGARETTE ADS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal judge on Tuesday struck down a New York
City law that would have banned cigarette advertising from almost
every street and sharply limited it in stores, saying that only the
federal government could impose such restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling came almost a year after the City Council voted
overwhelmingly to pass the law, which prohibited store owners from
placing tobacco advertisements on doors and awnings and in windows.
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani initially opposed the law on the ground that
it might be unconstitutional, but he ultimately signed it, saying
he hoped it would decrease cigarette sales to minors.
</P>
<P>
   The law also barred outdoor tobacco advertisements within 1,000
feet of schools, playgrounds, day care centers and amusement
arcades. But since most outdoor cigarette advertising is to end
under the nationwide settlement with tobacco companies, that part
of the law would have been largely irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of small grocery stores sued the city immediately
after Giuliani signed the law, saying that it violated their right
to free speech and predicting that it would jeopardize some of the
$30 million that store owners in New York City receive from tobacco
manufacturers for placing tobacco displays in their windows. Under
the law, such ads would still be allowed only if they could not be
seen from the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue we are dealing with is our right to advertise
perfectly legal products,'' said Howard Tisch, president of the
Metropolitan Food Council, a trade group representing 1,200
independent supermarkets in the tri-state region. ``This was an
attack by the health police who were willing to destroy us to
accomplish their goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani administration refused to comment Tuesday on the
ruling by Judge Deborah Batts of U.S. District Court in Manhattan,
saying it was still reviewing the decision. But the City Council
speaker, Peter Vallone, the bill's main sponsor, said he would
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's decisionis a setback for the children of New York
City,'' Vallone said. ``All research shows that teen-age smoking is
skyrocketing, and one of the biggest reasons is the advertising
targeting young people.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Over the years Bill Clinton had no better friend in
the business world than the Wall Street partnership of Goldman,
Sachs and Co. In 1992 and 1996, the firm was among his largest
donors and fund-raisers. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin once ran
the place, and as world markets melted over the last 18 months, the
phone lines between Goldman and Washington were constantly abuzz.
</P>
<P>
   But over the last week, as an impeachment of the president has
moved from a distant possibility to a strong likelihood, Goldman's
top executives say they have started no phone campaigns and twisted
no arms. Indeed, many of Clinton's allies in the business world _
from Silicon Valley to Wall Street _ say they are sitting this one
out even though they think a prolonged Senate trial could trigger a
market shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this will have more impact in financial markets than
people commonly believe, particularly if it drags on,'' Jon
Corzine, Goldman's co-chairman, said on Tuesday as more Republican
moderates declared that they would vote for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apart from the merits of the question, it's an unattractive
debate for the markets because they don't like uncertainty, and an
inability to respond to tough situations,'' he added. ``And in the
economic situation the world has been in, the United States has
been the main country to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Corzine says that he has made no telephone calls to members
of Congress on the issue and that he and other executives were
concerned that any organized lobbying effort might backfire,
hurting the president's cause.
</P>
<P>
   There have been some organized lobbying efforts: Rep. Brian
Bilbray, R-Calif., has received a flood of calls from Silicon
Valley executives who say they are not defending Clinton, but fear
that a prolonged fight could damage the economy, members of
Bilbray's staff said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides raise the same specter, noting that these days,
the United States is the keystone to the world economy _ and any
suggestion that its executive branch will spend more time fighting
for survival could send a chill around the world. It is an argument
that, right or wrong, would have resounded far more widely in
September and October, when the world economy seemed at the
precipice of disaster.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the market meltdowns that raced around the world this
fall began on Aug. 17, the day that Clinton testified in front of
the grand jury. But that was also the day that Russia announced a
default on its debt, and in the end Russia's troubles, rather than
Clinton's, were blamed for the flight from emerging markets around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   But at least for now, the situation looks less perilous. The
U.S. markets have recovered, even if much of the rest of the world
has not. And in the absence of economic pain here, the gathering
storm of impeachment has created more confusion than fear in the
business and financial worlds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard anything but questions from my members,'' said
Tom Donahue, the president and chief executive of the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce, the parent organization for 3,000 chambers of commerce
around the country. ``No one is yelling `stop this thing.' Business
executives don't know if they are on this side or that.''
</P>
<P>
   Donahue notes, though, that he has heard ``nothing from the
White House,'' which turns to him regularly during legislative
battles. Other executives say the same, and Clinton's aides say
they have deliberately avoided anything that would resemble a
lobbying effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just silly to think that many of these guys are going to
come to our defense,'' one of Clinton's Cabinet members said
recently. ``Do you think that the American business community is
going to take on the Republican leadership, even if they think this
whole thing is nuts? CEO's are not about to stick their necks out,
not on this one.''
</P>
<P>
   In part that reflects the natural divide between business
executives and politicians, who, especially in good times, have
very different priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent I can tell, this hasn't been on people's radar
screens,'' said Jeffrey Garten, the dean of the Yale School of
Management and a former top official in the Commerce Department
during Clinton's first term. ``When you talk to CEO's now, what
they are worried about is deflation, and the prospect that they are
heading into an era of brutal competition and massive
restructuring. The fact that Bill Clinton will be diminished in the
next 18 months is not their greatest concern.''
</P>
<P>
   That could change if the prospect of a long Senate trial
triggered a market sell-off. While the stock market so far has
seemed little affected, the dollar has fallen in recent days _
which has been widely interpreted a sign that international
investors are nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of jitteryness,'' said Alan Sinai, the chief
global economist of Primark Decision Economics. ``We are headed
into a risk-laden 1999, at a time when the world economy is both
soft and fragile. People are worried about Russia, about Brazil.
And this adds uncertainty about how the U.S. might respond.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a day marked by a frenzy of electronic and
in-person lobbying, 20 feminist leaders Tuesday held a news
conference in support of President Clinton and than marched
unannounced on the office of the incoming House speaker, Robert
Livingston. They were granted a 20-minute session with the
Louisiana Republican. It ended swiftly and sourly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was extremely insulting to the modern American women's
movement,'' said Betty Friedan, the feminist who earlier dismissed
the entire constitutional crisis as the work of a ``bunch of dirty
old white men trying to use sexual issues wrongly.''
</P>
<P>
   The women complained that Livingston had insulted their feminist
credentials, questioning how they could defend Clinton's conduct
with a young woman intern.
</P>
<P>
   The interaction between Livingston and the women was probably
one of the least successful examples of grass-roots lobbying in
Washington Tuesday, no matter how colorful it proved to be. (``I
did not insult one of them,'' Livingston said. ``I resent that.
They marched over without an appointment, and I said I thought my
mother was as much a feminist as anyone in the crowd.'')
</P>
<P>
   In what may be remembered less as an effective exercise of
political power than as a last gasp of frustration, a host of
supporters of Clinton have turned to personal lobbying, telephones,
e-mail, electronic petitions, rallies, prayer vigils and letters,
embracing modern variants of some old-fashioned political
techniques to try to save Clinton from becoming the second
president to be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   It is an effort that even some of its leaders say may prove
futile, and some of Clinton's friends worry might even be
counterproductive, as the meeting with Livingston suggested, given
the particular ideological bent of the advocates. But it is also a
way in which hundreds of thousands of people have taken a direct
role in trying to affect a struggle that has, until now, been
played out mostly on television, in grand jury rooms and in a
congressional committee hearing room.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet Tuesday, any American who opposed President
Clinton's impeachment could, with a few clicks on a keyboard,
``sign'' an electronic petition and dispatch it to wavering members
of Congress, courtesy of two software entrepreneuers in Berkeley,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A toll-free anti-impeachment hot line, set up by People for the
American Way, toggled calls right into the Capitol switchboard into
the night. Once connected, callers could read from a prepared
script urging a vote against impeachment, available on the
organization's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   There was a rally by academics and writers in New York on Monday
night. Another one, with more than a few promised celebrities, is
planned at the Federal Building in Los Angeles on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   And on Thursday, in one penultimate example of the kind of
grass-roots organizing that has rumbled to life in response to this
threat to Clinton's presidency, the Rev. Jesse Jackson plans to
lead a four-hour prayer vigil on the steps of the Capitol. Unions
are to bus in members from New York and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, it is clear that we have to beat down the doors
of Congress to remind them that they represent the people,'' said
Carole Shields, president of People for the American Way, the
liberal advocacy group which, with Jackson, is at the heart of
organizing, from city hall rallies to hyperlinks on Internet sites.
``I don't think we have a choice.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the White House, in contrast to past
legislative battles, has played no active role in stirring up the
lobbying. Geraldine Ferraro, the 1984 candidate for vice president,
said she began calling former colleagues in Congress on Clinton's
behalf after watching an interview with some of the moderate
Republicans on the morning news.
</P>
<P>
   And much of this is being done on-the-fly. Wesley Boyd and Joan
Blades, software developers in Berkeley, started their Internet
petition with an investment of $89.95 (plus $39.95 a month to
maintain the site). Boyd said he now had more than 325,000
signatures from that original investment.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate effectiveness of all this is another question. For
one thing, the organizations that have rallied behind Clinton are
not exactly the kinds that tend to have much sway with Republicans.
Ken Sunshine, a New York City consultant who was involved in union
efforts there on behalf of Clinton, said he wished that ``other
moderate types'' were involved in the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great majority of Americans seem to be against impeachment
and many of them would be pretty good at influencing these
congressmen,'' Sunshine said. ``Where are they? I mean, it's the
activists that flex their muscles.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Kim Gandy, the executive vice president of the National
Organization for Women, had trouble mustering much optimism after
returning from the encounter with Livingston. ``You know, it's not
over until it's over,'' Gandy said. ``People can change their
votes. But I think it's difficult.''

WHITE HOUSE STRATEGISTS SEEK LAST-MINUTE SOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House clung to a rapidly fraying strand
of hope Tuesday as moderate Republicans deserted President Clinton
at a staggering pace and many of his top allies predicted the House
will impeach the embattled president Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In an extraordinary turnaround, Clinton's strategists
frantically searched for a last-minute solution to the crisis, just
weeks after the president appeared all but certain to avoid such a
fate.
</P>
<P>
   The situation grew so desperate that some of Clinton's allies,
resigned to his impeachment, already were examining proposals to
extricate him from the historic proceedings before the Senate
launches a full-blown trial into charges stemming from his
consensual sexual affair with the former White House intern, Monica
S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that impeachment is going to pass,'' said
Representative J. Joseph Moakley, a Massachusetts Democrat who is a
Clinton ally and dean of the New England delegation in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Moakley's sentiments were echoed by numerous lawmakers in both
parties, as a swarm of GOP moderates across the country abandoned
the president despite a new, Republican-sponsored censure plan that
would require Clinton to pay a $2 million fine out of his personal
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Amid frenzied, grass-roots campaigns and lobbying efforts by
forces on both sides of the issue, all signs indicated the
pro-impeachment momentum will gain speed Wednesday unless Clinton
defies political logic and expands his portfolio as the ``Comeback
Kid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be something he can do to turn this around, but it
certainly doesn't look very good,'' said Representative Martin T.
Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee.
``The trend is certainly disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   In one possible last-ditch scenario, Clinton could meet at the
White House with a dozen undecided GOP lawmakers to try to persuade
them to oppose impeachment and enlist colleagues to join them,
according to a congressional source.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is aimed at how we can affect those undecided
moderate Republicans, and how much further the president can go in
addressing them,'' the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton already has agreed to meet Wednesday with one key
moderate Republican, Representative Christopher Shays of
Connecticut, who had vowed to oppose impeachment but announced on
Monday that he was reconsidering his position. In a town meeting
with his constituents Tuesday night, Shays said he will not make a
final decision until he votes Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The developments unfolded as Clinton flew home from a historic
visit to the Middle East to confront the grimmest challenge to his
tattered presidency. Hour by hour on the day-long journey, one
moderate Republican after another turned against the president,
announcing plans to vote for at least one, if not all four, of the
impeachments charges: two counts of perjury and one each of
obstruction of justice and abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   The group included several highly influential GOP lawmakers,
including Representatives Nancy L. Johnson of Connecticut and Fred
Upton of Michigan, who co-chair the Republican moderate caucus
known as the Tuesday Group.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was chairwoman of the House committee that last year
fined Speaker Newt Gingrich $300,000 for ethics violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president does not have the right to commit perjury when
it is convenient or when he thinks the charges against him are
frivolous,'' Johnson said. ``No one is above the law, not even the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton suffered damaging setbacks in the critical battleground
of New York, whose nine GOP holdouts were seen as so crucial to the
president that Andrew Cuomo, the secretary of Housing and Urban
Development and son of former New York Governor Mario Cuomo, was
enlisted Tuesday to appeal to the group.
</P>
<P>
   By nightfall, four of the ``New York Nine'' had vowed to vote
for impeachment, including Representative Michael P. Forbes, a
renegade Republican from eastern Long Island who had been seen as
likely to support Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse for the White House, Representative Jack Quinn, a New
York Republican who had indicated he would oppose impeachment,
announced he will recommend removing Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Joseph P. Kennedy II, a Massachusetts Democrat
who did not seek reelection this year after six terms in the House,
portrayed the pro-impeachment juggernaut as a potential danger to
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people really have to know this is a runaway
train at the moment,'' Kennedy said in a news conference in Boston.
``The amount of damage that will be sustained to our country and to
the leadership of America throughout the world if we move forward
on this is going to be very, very substantial.''
</P>
<P>
   But even many prominent Democrats believe Clinton has lost his
final opportunity to avoid impeachment. Most of the moderate
Republicans who have turned against Clinton said he has failed to
acknowledge that he lied under oath in court proceedings, as they
believe he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president would have been well served if he had offered up
a strong statement,'' Senator John F. Kerry said during an
interview in Boston, where he spent an hour ringing a bell for the
Salvation Army. ``He did not do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The 435-member House is expected to begin debating the four
charges against Clinton Thursday at 10 a.m. The rules permit only
an hour debate on the impeachment resolution, but GOP leaders said
they will seek an agreement to extend the debate to six to eight
hours. Separate votes on each article of impeachment will follow.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton needs 218 votes to avoid impeachment, but the chances
dimmed drastically as nearly half of the 38 undeclared GOP
moderates announced in the last two days that they would recommend
removing him from office. There are 228 Republicans and 206
Democrats in the House, with one independent who has said he will
oppose impeachment: Representative Bernard Sanders of Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties have scheduled caucuses for their House members
Wednesday to develop strategies for the climactic showdown. But
Democratic leaders have made no secret that they plan to use every
parliamentary and rhetorical tactic available to try to force a
vote on a censure alternative, no matter which party proposes one.
</P>
<P>
   Even though GOP leaders have vowed to block such a move, an
undeclared Republican moderate, Representative Michael N. Castle of
Delaware, Tuesday proposed a beefed-up censure plan that would
require Clinton to pay at least $2 million as restitution for the
cost of the Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even at this late date there are compelling reasons to pursue
a different course with a better solution for our nation,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the speaker-elect, Robert L. Livingston of Louisiana,
reiterated Tuesday that he will not allow a censure vote and that
he expects GOP members to remain unified if Democrats try to force
the issue with parliamentary tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the authors of a Democratic censure plan, including
Representative William D. Delahunt of Massachusetts, asked
Representative Gerald B.H. Solomon of New York, chairman of the
House Rules Committee, to clear the way for a censure vote. The
request was given little hope of being granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look like we're going to have a shot at a censure
vote,'' Moakley said. ``It's a long, long shot.''
</P>
<P>
   As the last uncommitted lawmakers prepare to vote, the Judiciary
Committee was due to release its report to the House on the
Lewinsky matter early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Republicans, in their majority report, advised the
House to impeach Clinton because he ``disgraced...the high office
he holds.''
</P>
<P>
   In the minority response, committee Democrats said the
impeachment charges are based on evidence that is ``shaky, at
best.''

 WASHINGTON: impeach him.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Members of the public have consistently said they would prefer
that Clinton finish his term. According to the latest New York
Times/CBS News Poll 69 percent of respondents continue to say it
would be better for the country if Clinton remained in office,
while only 28 percent say he should resign, according to the latest
New York Times/CBS News Poll. That sentiment has held steady since
September when the question was first asked.
</P>
<P>
   But public sentiment for resignation jumps when a different,
hypothetical question is asked about possible resignation if a vote
by the House sends articles of impeachment to the Senate for a
trial. In that situation, 40 percent say it would be better for the
country for Clinton to resign, while 56 percent oppose resignation.
</P>
<P>
   The White House reacted favorably to the censure options offered
by Dole and Castle as a means for members of Congress to condemn
the president's behavior without provoking a constitutional crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Dole's proposal, made in an op-ed article in Tuesday's New York
Times, calls for the House to complete its vote on impeachment.
Regardless of the House action, the Senate and House would
immediately draft a strong joint resolution of censure
incorporating the charges against Clinton _ perjury, obstruction of
justice and abuse of power. The bill could also include a financial
penalty. Clinton would have to accept the censure resolution at a
public signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Castle said that he was seeking a solution that would respond to
the majority of the public that abhors the president's actions but
does not want to see him removed from office. His proposal would
repeat the charges against Clinton and affirm that he remains
liable to criminal prosecution after he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   Castle said that he believed the Senate was unlikely to vote to
convict Clinton and eject him from office. ``Would not the country
be better served if we took action now _ in the next 48 hours _ to
bring this matter to the same conclusion that is likely to occur
even after months of a Senate trial?'' Castle said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   A White House official, speaking not for attribution, said that
Clinton would be reluctant to sign anything that forces him to
confess to serious crimes and constitutional offenses. But if the
House votes to impeach, Clinton might consider such a step to spare
himself and the nation the agony of a protracted Senate trial, the
aide said.
</P>
<P>
   As the stream of previously undeclared Republicans announced
their intentions to vote for impeachment, at least two
rank-and-file Republicans reserved judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've announced I won't announce,'' said Rep. Jim Greenwood of
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Davis of Virginia, the newly-elected chairman of the
House Republican campaign committee, at first ignored questions
from reporters as he walked to a leadership meeting on the Capitol
Tuesday. Finally, he snapped, ``The committee report isn't even
printed yet. I'd like to read that before I make up my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to the House Judiciary Committee's summary
report of the articles of impeachment.

U.S. WARNS TERRORISM AGAINST AMERICANS MAY BE IMMINENT IN MIDEAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Osama Bin Laden, the Saudi dissident the United
States has accused of bombing the American embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania in August, has ordered a terrorist attack on American
targets in the Persian Gulf within the next few days or weeks,
Administration officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   American intelligence agents learned of preparations for a
strike after eavesdropping on conversations between bin Laden and
members of the loose-knit terrorist organization that he operates
around the Islamic world, the officials said, speaking on condition
they not be identified. Bin Laden remains in hiding in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   As of Tuesday the Pentagon would not publicly confirm the
reports of Bin Laden's plans, but it did announce that American
military forces in the region had been placed on the highest state
of alert possible short of an actual attack. The Pentagon's alert
followed the State Department's warning on Monday to American
diplomats and civilians in seven Persian Gulf states of the
``strong possibility'' of an attack within the next 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that we have significant credible intelligence
suggesting the possibility of an imminent terrorist action in the
Middle Eastern region,'' the Pentagon's spokesman, Kenneth Bacon,
said at a news conference Tuesday. ``And for that reason, American
citizens have been warned, American diplomats have been warned, and
American soldiers have been put on a higher state of threat
condition.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration fired several dozen cruise missiles
into Afghanistan on Aug. 20, two weeks after the embassy bombings,
in an attempt to destroy bin Laden's organization and, officials
concede, to kill bin Laden and as many of his lieutenants as
possible. The reports of bin Laden's latest plan suggest the
American strike did little to dissuade him from further attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The officials offered few details about the nature or targets of
the planned attack, citing the sensitivity of
intelligence-gathering methods. One official, said the intelligence
did not make clear where exactly the attack would occur or how many
attacks were planned, though they said the intercepts made it clear
bin Laden was orchestrating retaliation against Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has linked bin Laden's network to a number of
terrorist attacks in addition to the simultaneous embassy bombings
in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, that killed 224
people and injured 5,000. Bin Laden is also suspected of
involvement in two attacks on American forces in Saudi Arabia in
1995 and 1996 that left 24 American servicemen dead.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's warning applied to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Yemen.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has 24,000 troops in the region, in all of
those countries except Yemen, and aboard naval ships plying the
Persian Gulf as part of the long-term monitoring of Iraq. The
largest contingents of American troops are in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia
and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 5,000 American military personnel are in Saudi
Arabia, most of whom were moved to the remote, heavily fortified
Prince Sultan Air Base at Al-Kharj, 70 miles southeast of the
capital, Riyadh, following the bombing of Khobar Towers in 1996.
Nineteen airmen died in that attack.
</P>
<P>
   Troops in the region already maintain a relatively high state of
alert. The Pentagon classifies the ``threat condition'' at any
given base on a daily basis, starting with normal and increasing in
gravity to Alpha, Bravo, Charlie and Delta. It has now been raised
to Charlie at virtually all the bases in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Since the cruise-missile strikes against Afghanistan, as well as
one in the Sudan, in August, the Pentagon itself and most bases in
the United States have raised their ``threat condition'' to Alpha.
Condition Charlie means that commanders believe some form of
terrorist attack is imminent; Delta means it has already started.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has increased its alerts in the region before, but
rarely have the threats been so explicit.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon, the Pentagon's spokesman, said that security measures at
bases were left to the discretion of the base commanders, but the
alert generally confines troops to their bases and intensifies
checkpoints and patrols.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy has also canceled port calls by its sailors aboard its
fleet of 13 warships now in the gulf. In Bahrain's capital, Manama,
where the Fifth Fleet has its headquarters, sailors have been
placed under curfew and told not to gather in large numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, a wealthy exile, has remained in Afghanistan with the
blessing of the Taliban fundamentalists who rule most of that
country. In recent weeks, news reports have suggested he is ill,
hobbled by some unspecified ailment. One official said today those
reports had some basis, though it remains far from clear how ill he
is.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be wishful thinking on the part of some,'' the official
said.

RECORDING INDUSTRY PLAN AIMS TO SELL MUSIC VIA INTERNET
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By JON PARELES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If all goes according to plan, music fans will be
able to buy top hits for electronic delivery through the Internet
by Christmas 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In a press conference Tuesday, at the Sony Building in midtown
Manhattan (and cybercast through the Internet at www.riaa.com),
leaders of the Recording Industry Association of America and chief
executives of the five major recording companies said they would
work with major technology companies to develop the Secure Digital
Music Initiative, a standard for delivery of music over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The standard would let copyright owners control the distribution
of their music while making it easily available for sale.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative intends to create technological specifications
for music distribution that would be as widely used as formats like
compact disks or VHS tapes. Those specifications would be available
to any company wishing to distribute music through the Internet.
Microsoft, Sony Corp., AT&AMP;T, IBM, Toshiba and America Online are
among the companies that announced support for the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   With the standard in use, consumers would need only one kind of
software ``player'' for all the music released by the major
companies, which control about 90 percent of the recorded-music
market in the United States. The Recording Industry Association of
Japan and the London-based International Federation of the
Phonographic Industry, which represents companies in 70 countries,
have also joined the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Those companies have been reluctant to sell music directly
through the Internet for fear of piracy. ``We need copyright
protection,'' said Hilary Rosen, the chief executive of the
Recording Industry Association of America, ``but we must not stifle
technology to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   The features of the standard, Ms. Rosen said, await the
decisions of the initiative, which will begin full-time work in
February. But they would be likely to include copy protection
(limiting the number of copies that can be made), encryption (a way
of making sure that only an authorized consumer can play back the
music) and watermarking, which would show the source of the music,
a way to trace back pirated music to its source. (Two current
methods of digital distribution that incorporate those features,
Liquid Audio and AT&AMP;T's a2b, are incompatible with each other.)
</P>
<P>
   Whether consumers would be buying individual songs, full albums
or other formats would be up to recording companies and musicians
once the standard has been accepted.
</P>
<P>
   BMG Entertainment chief executive Strauss Zelnick said he did
not envision lower prices, even if consumers bought their music as
electronic impulses rather than physical CDs. ``The cost of a CD is
related to the creative effort that goes into making the music,
which is a lot more than the plastic that goes into a disk,'' he
said. ``What's driving the costs is rewarding the artists for their
creativity.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While the major labels have waited to create a digital
distribution system, a de facto technological standard has arisen,
known as MP3. MP3 compresses digital audio information to a size
that makes it relatively practical to send over the Internet, and
hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Web sites offer free MP3 music
files ready for downloading. Software that plays MP3 files, with
names like WinAmp and FreeAmp, is available on the Internet, and
the Netshow software in Windows 98 includes an MP3 player.
</P>
<P>
   ``The genie is out of the bottle,'' said Rob Glaser, the
chairman and chief executive of Real Networks Inc., a leader in
delivering music and video over the Internet. ``As MP3
demonstrates, when the industry doesn't come together and create a
solution, things happen anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   MP3 files offer no protection against copying. There are
hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of MP3 sites on the Internet, many
of them offering free MP3 copies of music released by the major
recording companies. Ordinary music CDs are digital master copies
that can be easily copied or turned into computer- sound files. And
performers, songwriters, publishers and recording companies receive
no income when computer users download those files. On college
campuses in particular, where many students have fast Internet
access, music in the MP3 format is extremely popular.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Diamond Multimedia began selling the Rio PMP300, a
portable MP3 player, allowing listeners to hear MP3 files when away
from their computers. The recording industry association had tried
to block sales of the player. Some independent music companies have
begun selling music in the MP3 format, among them Goodnoise
(www.goodnoise.com), which generally charges 99 cents a song.
Robert Kohn, the chairman of Goodnoise, said: ``MP3 is unstoppable.
Any initiative now is like launching Betamax two years after VHS
has become the standard. The real solution to piracy is to make
music cheaper to buy than it is to steal.''

   WANNABE, Conn. _ We knew this was a bag job when we walked into
the Connecticut State House and saw a legislator wearing a hard hat
with a Patriots logo on the side.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Angelo Fusco, a Republican from Southington, was
standing in the grand lobby of the State House Tuesday morning, and
like most of his brethren, he could not wait to line Robert Kraft's
pockets with 375 million pieces of silver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hartford needs this badly,'' said Fusco, adjusting his Pats
helmet. ``Ralph Nader called us all whores. He is obviously
ignorant of this project. I'm certainly not a whore. He offended
the dignity and respect that 3.2 million people in Connecticut have
in this process.''
</P>
<P>
   The tone was thereby set for Tuesday night's slam-dunk vote in
the Legislature, a motion which forever should stand as a monument
to Hartford's inferiority complex (this place makes Worcester look
like Paris).
</P>
<P>
   And so the Team Formerly Known as the New England Patriots,
founded by the late Billy Sullivan in 1959, moved a giant step
closer to playing football games in the New York suburb that has so
long served as the term-life capital of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Yeesh. Wait till the Big Boys of the NFL get a load of this
place. Think there was Boston outrage when Providence was selected
as the host city of the 1997 AFC Championship Game in Foxborough?
If Kraft's team ever makes it back to the championship game while
playing in Hartford, the league no doubt will be forced to
headquarter in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   It was quite a day here in the Old File
Cabinet-by-the-Connecticut. The Hartford Courant greeted its
morning readers with an editorial penned by the
desperate-to-be-loved Kraft. Remember that love letter ad Bob sent
readers of the Globe last month? Well, Tuesday he told these folks,
``In hindsight, relocating to Hartford is something we should have
done years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks, Bob. No doubt you were all teary-eyed when you wrote
that one.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was quiet at nearby Yo-Adriaen's Landing (courtesy,
WEEI). The power plant was still operating full steam ahead, and
hundreds of cars covered the space which someday may be patrolled
by Drew Bledsoe. This means that when/if the stadium is built,
we'll be able to say that the Connecticut Legislature took a
parking lot and put up paradise. Kraft should dump the limo and
arrive in a Big Yellow Taxi.
</P>
<P>
   There was no traffic downtown early Tuesday (why would there
be?), and parking was free at the State House. Try doing that in
the Hub of the Universe.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Governor John Rowland, perhaps the only politician
on the planet who can shine Kraft's shoes with more gusto than
Massachusetts congressman Marty Meehan, read his annual Christmas
poem to the local Chamber of Commerce and concluded, ``To the
whining masses in Boston, I just have to laugh . . . We may be a
bunch of Yahoos, but we managed to land the Krafts.''
</P>
<P>
   Oooh. That one hurt. They landed the Krafts. Are we supposed to
be jealous? These nitwits would brag about getting home video
rights to ``The Postman.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Kraft may be indebted to those who've ripped this deal
in the Boston. It is believed that some of those on the fence for
the vote were swayed by the darts and arrows slung from the media
Blue Meanies in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Mike Peters, an affable sort who apologized for calling
one Boston sports columnist a ``chia pet'' (no offense taken, Your
Honor), said, ``Unlike what's been written, we've got a lot to
offer. And I believe in Bob Kraft. I don't think anyone would pull
on the emotion of these people and then pull the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the State House, there was a lone protester, Clifford
Glasberg, who said he had a master's degree in community
development but was working as a convenience store clerk in Storrs.
Glasberg's sign read, ``Welcome to Giveaway City.''
</P>
<P>
   Glasberg said, ``I'm here today because I feel that the
democratic process is being subverted by powerful leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the chambers, a surprisingly lucid rep named John Wayne
Fox made a Finneran-like case against the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not something we can go back to our people and be
proud of. What's the matter with us?'' asked Fox. ``This does
nothing for Hartford.'
</P>
<P>
   But for every clear-headed Fox, there was a guy in a Patriots
hard hat.
</P>
<P>
   So now Hartford has its stadium deal. And among bad ideas of
this century, it's right there alongside the Edsel, New Coke,
``Ishtar,'' and Dan Rather signing off his newscast with
``Courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Courage and good sense were in short supply here Tuesday. And
all evidence to the contrary, I still say the Pats never will play
a game in Hartford.

PRICE ASSERTS JORDAN'S INTERESTS IN PEACE SETTLEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By WILLIAM A. ORME JR.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan Tuesday praised
President Clinton's ``personal commitment and dedication'' to the
Israeli-Palestinian peace effort. But he said the talks should be
broadened to include direct consultations with Jordan and other
neighboring Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are important issues like Jerusalem, refugees, water and
security-related issues that cannot be discussed solely in an
Israeli-Palestinian context,'' said Hassan, who has taken an
increasingly visible role in the prolonged absence of his brother,
King Hussein, who has been stricken with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The crown prince made his comments on a three-hour visit by
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Though careful to reiterate Jordan's support for the peace
negotiations that his brother has so passionately endorsed, Prince
Hassan repeatedly stressed that any lasting settlement has to take
into account the interests of Jordan and Egypt and, eventually,
Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Here, as in much of the rest of the Arab world, President
Clinton's visit on Monday to Gaza was hailed as a historic
breakthrough not just in U.S.-Palestinian relations, but also for
U.S. policy throughout the Middle East. The speeches by Clinton and
Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, were broadcast live on state
television and dominated the headlines this morning. ``Clinton
Gives the Green Light for Palestinian Independence,'' Al-Aswaq
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like statehood,'' The Jordan Times said in an
editorial. ``It sounded like statehood. Clinton's words _ `the
Palestinian people and their elected representatives now have a
chance to determine their own destiny on their own land' _ finally
articulated the inevitable: a Palestinian state on Palestinian
national land.''
</P>
<P>
   Hassan refrained from joining the praise. His remarks conveyed
an undercurrent of unease about the Palestinians' concluding an
American-backed peace deal with Israel without substantive
Jordanian input or mediation.
</P>
<P>
   That unease was also apparent in Egypt, the other chief patron
of the Palestinian cause. While Clinton toured Gaza with Arafat on
Monday, Foreign Minister Amr Moussa of Eygpt said in Cairo,
``Coordination between the Palestinians, Jordan and Egypt on the
next stages'' of the talks ``is a must.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Egypt is ready to cooperate and coordinate without imposing
anything on the Palestinians,'' Moussa said after having met in his
office with Foreign Minister Abdallah al-Khatib of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   So-called final status talks between Israel and the
Palestinians, scheduled to end in May, are starting now, Albright
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan noted that the talks would affect Jordan's border
relationships, its trade patterns and the status of 1.1 million
residents, more than one-fourth of the population, who are
registered with the United Nations as Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. policy makers have been quite open about their hopes that
U.S. support for Palestinian national aspirations will further
their other strategic goals in the region, including efforts to
court Arab support for diplomatic pressure and possible military
strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the reactions in Jordan and Egypt suggest that the
repercussions of closer U.S.-Palestinian ties could be more complex
for the two countries that have become the chief regional patrons
of the Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, with all due respect to President Clinton, to
the American administration and to the government of Israel and,
indeed, to our Palestinian brethren, when you talk about issues
such as refugees, water, security and Jerusalem you are, by
definition, talking about an overarching issue,'' Hassan said.
``The Jordanian peace treaty calls upon us to invoke Jordanian
interests when it comes to many of these issues. For comprehensive
peace to be truly comprehensive you need to encourage the
involvement of all parties concerned, including, clearly, the role
of Syria and Lebanon at a given moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright traveled here on a Marine Corps helicopter immediately
after the meeting this morning among Clinton, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Received by a Jordanian honor guard in kaffiyehs and
ankle-length olive tunics, she was accompanied to the meetings with
Hassan by Undersecretary of State Martin Indyk; a spokesman, James
Rubin, and other State Department officials. The delegation
returned to Ben-Gurion Airport in Israel for the flight back to
Washington on Air Force One.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Judiciary Committee has produced a
500-page report that summarizes the major arguments on both sides
and is meant to be a primer for this week's House vote on four
articles of impeachment. Parts of it were made public Tuesday
night, reflecting the same partisan divisions that marked last
week's debates and votes.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican majority said President Clinton ``has disgraced
himself and the high office he holds.'' It continued: ``His high
crimes and misdemeanors undermine our Constitution. They warrant
his impeachment, his removal from office and his disqualification
from holding further office.''
</P>
<P>
   But committee Democrats said that the founding fathers ``would
shake their heads in puzzlement at both the process undertaken and
product produced by the committee.''
</P>
<P>
   The document breaks no new ground. Rather, it attempts to both
sum up the salient points on each side, including excerpts from the
testimony of witnesses, and provide a point-by-point defense of, or
attack on, the articles: two perjury counts, obstruction of justice
and abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on the Judiciary panel Tuesday night released only a
four-page introduction to their 400-page argument, which borrows
phrases and themes that Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the panel's
chairman, used throughout the hearings and debate to indict
Clinton's attempt to conceal his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than work with the judicial and legislative branches to
uphold the rule of law, he directly attacked their fundamental
truth-seeking function,'' the Republican introduction concludes.
</P>
<P>
   But a 93-page draft of the entire Democratic dissent asserts
that the charges against Clinton are not impeachable offenses. Even
if they were, the dissent continues, the evidence presented fails
to back up the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the committee Republicans ``essentially
rubber-stamped'' the independent counsel's report that became the
basis for the panel's allegations.
</P>
<P>
   With only a handful of the 435 House members still officially
undecided going into Thursday's debate, the committee's report is
unlikely to sway many of them, especially if they even the
slightest familiarity with the pros and cons of the argument.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Republican introduction's overarching theme is that the
president flouted the rule of law by lying under oath in
depositions to the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit and again
before the federal grand jury, and again in answers to 81 questions
from the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Although the full text of the Republican report was not
available tonight, aides involved in the drafting said it would
cite specific evidence to support each point in all four counts.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the Democratic dissent, echoing the White House defense,
challenged the Republican version at every turn. For instance, the
report said, the president did not commit perjury when answering
questions about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky because he was
using a definition of sexual relations given to him in the Jones
deposition ``not to include oral sex performed on him.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic dissent also attacks Ms. Lewinsky's truthfulness,
citing several examples from sworn testimony, ranging from her
false claims that the Secret Service brought the president to her
apartment one night to her claim that she had lunch with Hillary
Rodham Clinton.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Democrats recommended that the House censure
Clinton, not impeach him, and denounced the House Republican
leadership for forbidding lawmakers to vote on that alternative.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority has put the country on a collision course with
the Constitution by insisting that impeachment of the president is
the only means to address conduct that is serious but falls below
the standard for removal. There are, unfortunately, partisan
reasons behind the Majority's insistence that the House be given an
impeachment-or-nothing option.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a wide consensus among Americans that the president's
conduct should not go without some form of rebuke. There is also
wide agreement that impeachment is too severe a penalty. Rather
than ignoring the will of the people, Congress should find a way to
embody their sentiment.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The complete report is to be available on the Judiciary
committee's web site (www.house.gov/judiciary).  &QL;

<P>
   ``The arguments in favor of impeaching President William
Jefferson Clinton _ to follow the idiom of the articles voted by
the House Judiciary Committee _ come down to this:
</P>
<P>
   ``One, his behavior was disreputable. He deceived the courts and
the American people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two, the gravity of his offense is best measured by the
disgusted attention that has been given to what he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three, the arguments in his defense have been semantic and
legalistic. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Four, the objection that the American people are opposed to
impeachment ignores culture lags of historical frequency, including
general opposition to the liberation of the slaves. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Five, the true test of the stability of the Constitution is in
its usefulness in liberating the country from miscast faith in a
failed leader.

in Washington is out of hand. I blame a lot of it on the Gingrich
influence and the religious right and such _ to be partisan myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I have no doubt that a lot of blame also lies with the
president. His words got him into this and now he's trying to use
words to get out. ... It takes courage to be bipartisan. I recall
talking once to Ev Dirksen when he was leading the Republicans
about how to get a civil rights bill passed. It was hard for him to
move toward us on that one. But he did and we got a bill and the
country was spared a really mean debate. Now that was courage.''

   President of Whitman College
</P>
<P>
   ``What I see in part is Republicans using this as a payback for

I see is that House Republicans view a vote to impeach Clinton as
sort of a free vote in that they get to hammer him with an
indictment, knowing full well that it's almost a certainty that the
Senate will go along with the expressed wishes of the American
people and not convict him and throw him out of office. Still, it's
a scenario that would send a pretty powerful message about
unacceptable behavior _ indictment as adequate punishment for the
deed done. ...

   WASHINGTON _ The conservatives are picking up the scent of
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never underestimate the ability of Bill Clinton to
turn something around,'' said Howard Phillips, chairman of the
Conservative Caucus Inc., based in Vienna, Va. ``But clearly at
this hour, the trend is in favor of impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of impeachment is even drawing a conservative
presidential candidate to insert himself into the action. Steve
Forbes, who has not officially announced his candidacy but has been
trying to build alliances among conservatives, plans to running
radio commercials on Washington-area stations on Wednesday and
Thursday, urging listeners to tell their representatives to vote to
impeach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president lied to the people and is guilty of perjury by
lying under oath to a federal grand jury,'' Forbes declares in his
commercial. ``This is a matter for trial in the U.S. Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   If the House votes to impeach Clinton, conservatives are ready
to take credit. Conservative members of Congress, led by Rep. Bob
Barr of Georgia, have been pushing impeachment for months. With the
backing of the House Republican leadership, they picked up steam
and by Tuesday garnered the support of many previously undeclared
moderates, pushing the House closer to voting in favor of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, they have been backed by an extensive network
across the country of conservatives whose moral outrage _ and
prodding by their leaders, and missteps by Clinton himself _
galvanized them into action.
</P>
<P>
   The most elaborate network is that established by the Christian
Coalition. With less money than the labor unions and the People for
the American Way, which are running television commercials opposing
impeachment, the coalition has relied instead on phone trees, blast
faxes and instantaneous e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Tate, executive director of the coalition, which claims
2.1 million members, said Tuesday, ``We have circulated petitions
for the last month and a half. I quit counting signatures when we
broke a quarter of a million about two weeks ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The petitions continue to arrive on Capitol Hill, as do tens of
thousands of e-mails and faxes, since many of those who are trying
to call their representatives cannot get through the overloaded
Capitol switchboard.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Giersch, 67, owner of a civil engineering firm in Madera,
Calif., said he faxed a pro-impeachment letter to several members
of Congress after a friend showed him a letter from Gary Bauer,
head of the conservative Family Research Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should be impeached because he has totally eroded the
morals of this country, then lied about it and eroded our legal
system,'' Giersch said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer said that another of his organizations, American Renewal,
sent out faxes to about 6,000 conservatives who are also business
owners. ``Business organizations are neutral on impeachment or are
worried about the effect of impeachment on the economy,'' Bauer
said. ``But a lot of small-business owners are just beside
themselves that the guy might get away with it, and their overall
philosophical concerns are trumping any business concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Like hundreds of other people around the country who faxed their
views to Congress, Giersch wrote on his company letterhead. He said
in the interview that his views represented those of the 20
employees in his firm, Giersch &AMP; Associates Inc. ``I am the
company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Jack DeWitt, president and majority owner of Request
Foods, in Holland, Mich., also wrote to several members of Congress
on his company stationery and said he was speaking for his 360
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our people are conservative, pro-family, pro-life, and
we try to promote that type of business,'' he said. ``This is such
a black-and-white issue of right and wrong. I have five married
children and eight grandkids, and it's important to me that they're
going to live in a country that has a good family foundation. I've
been praying that Clinton resign.''

CONNECTICUT LAWMAKERS APPROVE PATRIOTS DEAL

   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Accomplishing in just four weeks what the
Massachusetts Legislature could not in several years, the
Connecticut General Assembly Tuesday night agreed to build and
furnish a new $375 million stadium for the New England Patriots as
part of massive revitalization effort for this struggling city.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly five hours of debate during which the decision to
lure the Patriots away from Massachusetts with the richest deal
ever carved for an NFL team appeared to be losing ground, house
lawmakers finally voted 97-49 in favor, handing Patriots owner
Robert Kraft both a financial and philosophical victory. Kraft, who
tried unsuccessfully to build a stadium in Massachusetts, had said
he would be forced to sell the team if he could not find a home for
the club in New England. With this deal, he could become one of the
richest owners in the league, sports analysts have said.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming show of support in the Connecticut house came
after many legislators rose to criticize the unusual speed which
the deal was constructed and put before them as well as its
enormous cost.
</P>
<P>
   But apparently swayed by last-minute changes in the bill, and
desperate for a way to remake this insurance capitol, lawmakers
surprised observers who had been predicting a close tally and
embraced the ambitious plan to have professional football here by
the fall of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the General Assembly's debate began Tuesday Senate
Minority Leader Louis DeLuca, a Woodbury Republican who was
critical of the proposal, seemed to symbolize the feelings of
several colleagues as he pinched his nose, and said he was going to
vote yes.
</P>
<P>
   The final bill, approved at by the House at 7:25 p.m.,
authorizes the state to borrow $274 million for the stadium,
infrastructure improvements and cleanup on the site along the
Connecticut River. Another $100 million in cash from the state's
projected budget surplus was also earmarked to help pay for the
development, part of a $1 billion downtown revitalization effort
known as Adriaen's Landing.
</P>
<P>
   The state Senate was expected to follow suit and approve the
bill later Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   As the day unfolded, lawmakers scrambled Tuesday to make some
changes in the bill, which has been on an unprecedented fast track
here since Governor John Rowland signed an initial agreement with
Kraft on Nov. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Among the last-minute alterations in the legislation:
</P>
<P>
   _ The short time frame for construction and environmental
permitting was stretched from 10 days to more than a month,
compared to a more typical 18-month process;
</P>
<P>
   _ Kraft's tax exempt status for the NFL retail and virtual
reality pavilion he has committed to build as part of the proposal
was revoked;
</P>
<P>
   _ The cap on a state guarantee to pay for unsold luxury seats
was reduced by 25 percent, limiting Connecticut's liability to a
maximum $13 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   While many lawmakers raised objections to the project, even some
who didn't like all the terms said they would vote for it
expressing a seemingly widespread feeling among lawmakers that the
city's economic and psychic needs outweighed the hundreds of
millions the state will pay for just 10 pro football games a year.
</P>
<P>
   With a single protestor standing in the cold outside the state
Capitol carrying a sign that said ``Welcome to the giveaway city,''
the House plowed ahead, asking questions, trying to answer
questions, and struggling with quantifying the value -- financial
and otherwise -- of a football franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers conceded that they did not know how much the
environmental cleanup costs would be for the proposed stadium site,
which is contaminated from a coal gasification plant that once
stood there. Nor could they guarantee that the 68,000-seat open-air
facility could be built on that site, now occupied by a steam
plant, because costs of moving the facility that heats and cools
many downtown office buildings could run too high.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do know that's not the responsibility of Mr. Kraft,'' said
Representative John Wayne Fox, a conservative Democrat from
Stamford. ``This is not a process I'm proud of. What committee
reviewed this? How many public hearings did we have? One? With all
due respect, it was a dog and pony show....What's the matter with
us?''
</P>
<P>
   Hot dog sales jobs, Fox added, will not be enough to bridge the
widening gap between rich and poor in Connecticut, a state with one
of the highest per capita incomes and three of the poorest cities
in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Mushinsky, a Wallingford Democrat, said she was swayed not
to vote on the project by constituents who called her office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next thing Kraft will want to sleep in Mark Twain's bed,'' she
said, referring to the famous one-time Hartford resident and
author.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, Republicans and fiscal conservatives joined with
liberal Democrats to vote for the enormous project.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a reasonable risk,'' said Representative Edward
Graziani, an Ellington Democrat. ``This is not reckless gambling.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Representative Dominic Mazzoccoli, a Newington Republican:
``Mayor Mike, this vote's for you. Merry Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Mike, as Hartford's leader and civic booster Michael
Peters is affectionately known, took an honorary seat on the
chamber rostrum next to House Speaker Thomas Ritter during the
debate, which stretched for hours into the night.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, the chamber erupted in applause and Ritter,
who just cast his final vote before vacating post, lifted a
Patriots T-shirt in celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut, a state desperate to retain more of its young
people and become more than a stop along the way to Boston or New
York, is looking for a linchpin to make Hartford known more for
than the dry business of insurance.
</P>
<P>
   In an interesting twist, some undecided legislators, angered by
spirited cracks against greater Hartford from Massachusetts media,
cast votes for the stadium in spiteful fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Invoking what became a wave of anti-Boston sentiment during
Tuesday's Special Session, Representative Robert Ward, the House
Minority Leader, said the city, which had been dubbed ``the filing
cabinet of the world'' by Globe sports columnist Dan Shaughnessy,
was gladly opening its drawers. Mayor Peters called the
curly-haired Shaughnessy a Chia Pet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not the filing cabinet of America,'' a jubilant Peters
said after the House vote. ``We're not
Chernoble-on-the-Connecticut. If Boston can't deal with it, I'm
sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland, at a Chamber of Commerce breakfast at the start of the
momentus day, read a poem to the tune of `Twas the Night Before
Christmas': ``To the masses in Boston, I just have to laugh, we may
be a bunch of yahoos, but we managed to land the Krafts.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kraft, in an opinion piece in Tuesday's Hartford
Courant, wrote: ``In hindsight, relocating to Hartford is something
we should have done years ago.''

`ALAMO DIARY' DONATED TO UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A rare and controversial Mexican memoir
detailing the fall of the Alamo and the death of Davy Crockett is
being donated to the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   UT Regent Thomas O. Hicks and his business partner, Charles W.
Tate of Houston, on Tuesday donated to UT the so-called ``Alamo
Diary,'' which they purchased for $350,000 last month at a Los
Angeles auction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dream come true,'' said Don E. Carlton, director for
UT's Center for American History, which will be the new home of the
document.
</P>
<P>
   The memoir had been on loan to the John Peace Collection at
UT-San Antonio until recently when Peace's descendants put it up
for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very concerned that after being on loan at a public
institution for 20 something years and then being sold on the open
market, we were afraid that this document ... would wind up in
private hands and disappear,'' Carlton said.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks and Tate both received their undergraduate degrees from
UT.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks is the chairman of the investment banking firm Hicks,
Muse, Tate &AMP; Furst Inc. of Dallas. Hicks was appointed to the UT
board of regents by former Gov. Ann Richards. Last year, he bought
the Texas Rangers baseball team from a group of investors that
included Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Tate in 1997 was named president of Hicks, Muse, a firm he
joined in 1991 after 19 years of work with Morgan Stanley &AMP; Co.
Tate was responsible for establishing the firm's New York presence,
for raising capital and for originating investment activities in
Mexico and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks said he was happy to take credit for donating the
manuscript to UT, but he said it was Tate's idea to purchase it.
Tate said he was afraid someone else would buy it because they were
unhappy that it destroys a myth about Crockett.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a concern that a detractor of the diary might buy it
and destroy it,'' said Tate, a native of San Antonio who wore
cowboy boots with the Alamo on them to the donation ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The memoir was written by Jose Enrique de la Pena, a junior
officer in Santa Anna's army when Mexican troops stormed the Alamo.
The document has been controversial because de la Pena said
Crockett did not die fighting but surrendered and was tortured to
death.
</P>
<P>
   Carlton had represented the history center at the auction, but
dropped out of the bidding when it passed the $300,000 mark. He
said he thought he had lost the document until the donors called
two hours later to say they were giving it to the center.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were an unhappy two hours for me,'' said Carlton, who
explained that the university was unaware any potential donors were
bidding on the documents.
</P>
<P>
   Tate and Hicks said they decided to buy the document on the day
of the auction while flying to Boston on a business trip. They said
they arranged to have a professional buy it for them and had no
idea that UT was bidding.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a win-win for the university,'' Hicks said. ``The
university gets the diary and they still have $300,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlton said the document _ which has been published by Texas
A&AMP;M University under the title ``With Santa Anna in Texas: A
Personal Narrative'' _ is important source material for scholars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very complex series of documents written in Spanish,''
he said. ``It's one of the best eye-witness accounts of the Texas
revolution. What makes it even more extraordinary is it's from the
Mexican point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlton said the controversy over Crockett's death is a
``tempest in a teapot'' that does nothing to harm Crockett's record
of bravery.
</P>
<P>
   The hand-written manuscript has been on loan to UTSA since the
late 1970s. It was published in Spanish in the 1950s and in English
20 years later. Many historians and laymen have claimed the memoir
was a 20th-century forgery.
</P>
<P>
   But an examination authorized by the Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield
auction house determined the paper had been made in Portugal in the
early 19th century and was a variety used by the Mexican army. Much
of the memoir was written by de la Pena when he was imprisoned for
opposing the Mexican government.
</P>
<P>
   The document was removed from the UTSA collection last year by
John Peace III, a rare book dealer who put it up for sale. Peace
had predicted the book would sell for $385,000.

INDIAN GOVERNMENT VOWS TO CONTINUE NUCLEAR MISSILE PROGRAM  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BARRY BEARAK    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ In an effort to reassure hard-liners Prime
Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee of India told both houses of
Parliament Tuesday that the government had shunned a proposed
moratorium on producing weapons-grade nuclear material and would
continue to develop an intermediate-range missile system.
</P>
<P>
   Reading from a text Vajpayee seemed intent on making it clear
that although India might be moving toward signing a nuclear test
ban treaty it intended to develop the megaton might that it showed
in May in two underground tests.
</P>
<P>
   India remains committed to maintaining a ``minimum credible
nuclear deterrent,'' he said. But he added, ``This government
remains unequivocally opposed to any suggestions that seek to place
India at a technological disadvantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the tests in May, followed in two weeks with tests by
Pakistan, India has been engaged in talks with American officials,
who felt betrayed by the tests and imposed economic sanctions on
the two countries. The negotiations have involved a proposed
trade-off, weakening the sanctions in exchange for halting a
nuclear buildup.
</P>
<P>
   Seven meetings have been held between the new external affairs
minister, Jaswant Singh, and Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott. An eighth is scheduled for next month here.
</P>
<P>
   The give-and-take of the negotiations has not been made public,
and many politicians have been insisting on a report. The
long-promised briefing Tuesday was received without outraged
comments. Some disappointed legislators said they had learned as
much about the talks from press coverage as they had from the Prime
Minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are getting very mixed signals,'' a member of the upper
house, Nilotpal Basu, said. ``In the entire negotiation process
what reciprocal responses from the United States have been of vital
importance? We still do not know.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington a senior Clinton administration official who
specializes in southern Asia said the speech was an accurate
reflection of the American-Indian dialogue. ``It is also clear that
Prime Minister Vajpayee is trying to build a national consensus for
no more nuclear testing and signing of the test ban treaty,'' the
official said. ``It is also clear that India intends to maintain a
`minimum nuclear deterrent,' but still has not defined just what
that will require. And we will want to discuss that with them.''
</P>
<P>
   In September, Vajpayee, speaking before the United Nations, said
that India had satisfied many security concerns with its nuclear
tests and was inclined toward signing the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty. Tuesday he repeated that. As he has often stated, Vajpayee
reiterated that India's objective for 50 years had been a world
free of nuclear weapons. But ``regrettably,'' he added, ``the
international community, particularly countries that have based
their security on nuclear weapons or a nuclear umbrella, have been
reluctant to embrace this objective.''
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, Vajpayee said, India had to keep its military
options open and, ``after an exemplary nuclear restraint,'' had
yielded to the weaponry, ``given the exceptional security-related
complexities of our region,'' namely tense relations with Pakistan
and China.
</P>
<P>
   He said an extended-range version of the Indian Agni missile was
being developed. ``Flight testing of such an enhanced-range Agni
will be conducted fully in accordance with established
international practice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the duress of the economic sanctions India and Pakistan
have agreed to bilateral talks. The discussions have yet to yield
much in the way of agreements, although they have succeeded
recently in having the United States lift some penalties.

A RICH MAHLER TRADITION IN A PHILHARMONIC SET  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 20) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the New York Philharmonic released ``The Historic
Broadcasts, 1923-87,'' a remarkable archival set of 10 CDs, a year
ago, an obvious question arose: Among the 26 composers represented,
why no Mahler? The Mahler tradition of the orchestra is, after all,
uniquely rich. Like those of the Vienna Philharmonic and the Royal
Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam, it was set in motion by
Gustav Mahler himself as conductor, but unlike those others, it was
not short-circuited in the 1930s and 40s by the anti-Semitic
fallout from Nazi annexation or occupation.
</P>
<P>
   The Philharmonic, the answer came back, was holding the big gun
in reserve, hoping to follow with a set consisting entirely of
Mahler's music. Now that release has impressively materialized on
12 CDs as ``The Mahler Broadcasts, 1948-82'' (NYP 9801/12), and the
obvious question becomes: Among the 10 conductors represented, why
no Bernstein? Leonard Bernstein, after all, though he did not
single-handedly revive the Philharmonic's Mahler tradition, as is
often supposed, certainly took it to its loftiest heights in a
series of performances throughout his tenure as music director,
from 1958 to 1969, and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the Philharmonic is quick to reply. Bernstein's omission,
it turns out, is not for lack of trying. Sedgwick Clark, the set's
producer, explains in booklet notes that of all the Mahler works
the maestro performed with the Philharmonic, all but two are
represented among Bernstein's commercial recordings with the
orchestra, which remain in more or less continual circulation.
</P>
<P>
   One of those absentees, the Eighth Symphony, was not broadcast,
and the orchestra's hopes to release the other, ``Das Lied von der
Erde,'' from 1967, foundered, Clark writes, when it was discovered
that ``rights for the release of Bernstein's Mahler broadcasts are
not available at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the set's conductors are all Mahlerians of substantial
achievement, including notable like John Barbirolli, Dimitri
Mitropoulos, Georg Solti, Leopold Stokowski, Klaus Tennstedt and
Bruno Walter. And some of the performances are certified classics,
of particular value for the light they shed on that murky
pre-Bernstein era of Mahler performance at the Philharmonic, even
if that light is not entirely new.
</P>
<P>
   It is good, for example, to have authorized and excellently
restored issues of Mitropoulos's Sixth Symphony, of 1955, and
Stokowski's Eighth, of 1950, which were previously represented only
by unauthorized or ancient releases of almost identical vintage.
</P>
<P>
   And the ``Lied von der Erde'' finally included, conducted by
Walter in 1948, differs most tellingly from his other indispensable
Philharmonic recordings of the work by including the great English
Mahler contralto Kathleen Ferrier, as she made her American debut,
at 35.
</P>
<P>
   Other landmarks in the orchestra's Mahler history are
represented as well. From its first Mahler festival at Carnegie
Hall, in 1959 and 1960, which commemorated the composer's
centenary, comes the Andante of the unfinished 10th Symphony,
conducted by Mitropoulos; from its second such festival, in 1976,
comes a Third Symphony conducted by Pierre Boulez, with Yvonne
Minton as the mezzo-soprano.
</P>
<P>
   Zubin Mehta's performance of the ``Resurrection'' Symphony, with
Kathleen Battle and Maureen Forrester as soloists, celebrated the
orchestra's 10,000th concert, in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the set offers a wealth of valuable information,
both on disk and in print. William Malloch's two-hour collection of
interviews ``I Remember Mahler,'' originally produced in 1964 for
KPFK radio in Los Angeles, is presented complete, alongside spoken
recollections by Walter, Stokowski and Barbirolli.
</P>
<P>
   Two lavish booklets offer program notes, artist biographies, a
guide to the shifting orchestral roster, lists of Mahler's own
performances with the orchestra and of the orchestra's Mahler
recordings, and groups of essays on Mahler's work as conductor and
composer and on the orchestra's relation to both.
</P>
<P>
   Most fascinating perhaps is the complete list of Mahler
performances by the orchestra (as Philharmonic or New York Symphony
Society, with which it merged in 1928). They range from the
Symphony Society's American premiere of the Fourth Symphony,
conducted by Walter Damrosch in 1904, to the First Symphony
conducted last July by Kurt Masur.
</P>
<P>
   Mahler himself led the American premieres of his
``Resurrection'' Symphony in 1908 with the Symphony Society and of
the First Symphony in 1909 with the Philharmonic, among other
performances. Bernstein took up the cause in 1959 with the funereal
third movement of the First Symphony in a televised Young People's
Concert, and he gave his last Mahler performances with the
orchestra in the ``Resurrection'' Symphony in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   In all, this set may well be a model of its kind. But in the
wake of all the Bernstein explanations, the question remains, Just
what kind is that? Without Bernstein, the collection cannot
remotely be said to represent the Philharmonic's Mahler tradition
in full or even at its best. It can only vaguely be called
historic, on the strength of those few older recordings. There was
evidently not a great deal of pre-Bernstein material from which to
choose.
</P>
<P>
   (According to the performance list, radio broadcasts of Mahler's
music began in 1925, with the second movement of the
``Resurrection'' Symphony conducted at a students' concert by
Willem Mengelberg, but the earliest surviving copy is from 1941, a
First Symphony led by Mitropoulos. In addition to that Mitropoulos
First and the early material in the set, there exist 12 other
copies of pre-Bernstein performances, of whatever quality,
conducted by Walter, Mitropoulos, Artur Rodzinski and Efrem Kurtz.)
</P>
<P>
   What the set amounts to is a collection of good, in some cases
excellent, performances, which are mostly not otherwise available,
at least in reproductions of such high quality. That is no small
thing, and in truth the set does not pretend to be more. Both
Mahler specialists and inveterate fans of the Philharmonic can only
be grateful.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the casual listener would do well to consider the package in
a broader context. (It is available only from the New York
Philharmonic at 800-557-8268 or on line at
www.newyorkphilharmonic.org, for $225 plus handling and shipping,
and at Tower Records stores.)
</P>
<P>
   For this motley armada, with elements both antique and modern,
sets out in perilous waters, crowded with well-organized fleets and
sleek vessels. At a time when classical-recording companies have
largely given up on new projects and fallen back on reissues of
venerable recordings, American orchestras have tried to make up
their losses by mining their archives to claim a share of the
``historical'' market.
</P>
<P>
   And they have had some success, as the Philharmonic did with its
wildly mixed package last year. But in the case of Mahler, the
major labels offer strenuous competition, with a steady diet of
reissues as well as occasional new recordings.
</P>
<P>
   Among the conductors in the Philharmonic package, two were
recently featured in major Mahler reissues. Walter's classic 1954
Columbia recording of the First Symphony with the Philharmonic was
just released in Sony Classical's Masterworks Heritage series (MHK
63328; CD). And EMI has repackaged Tennstedt's complete survey of
the symphonies and ``Das Lied von der Erde'' with the London
Philharmonic in a box commemorating the conductor's death this year
(EMI Classics 5 72799 2; 12 CDs).
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to Bernstein, the commercial labels have the
goods. Deutsche Grammophon has just reissued Bernstein's
magisterial late survey of the symphonies and other works with the
Vienna Philharmonic, the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra and the New
York Philharmonic in a digitally remastered edition (459 080-2; 16
CDs).
</P>
<P>
   Sony, meanwhile, is embarked on its latest reissue of
Bernstein's 1960s Columbia cycle of the symphonies, mostly with the
New York Philharmonic, in its Bernstein Century series.
</P>
<P>
   Just the other day, in fact, Bernstein's 1966 recording of the
First Symphony arrived (Sony Classical SMK 60732; CD), and a
listener who was long ago weaned on this version of the work, as on
other Mahler recordings by Bernstein and the Philharmonic, returned
to it for the first time in many years.
</P>
<P>
   The experience was utterly refreshing, revealing a remarkably
detailed approach to rhythm and articulation and a mercurial relish
for contrasts, all of which had been eroded in the memory by
decades of routine performances of the work in lesser hands and by
Bernstein's own later tendency toward grand visions. Now as then,
those lively qualities contrast fascinatingly with the ineffable
warmth and mystery of that Walter First, another early favorite
given new life.
</P>
<P>
   But between those two benchmarks in the Philharmonic
discography, the orchestra's new set inserts a relatively bland
version of the First Symphony, conducted by Barbirolli in 1959,
shortly before Bernstein's televised analysis of the work's third
movement.
</P>
<P>
   The Barbirolli account is by no means bad, despite a sluggish
tempo in the scherzo and some tenuous intonation in the funeral
march. (Through glasses of a different color, Clark, the producer,
sees ``rustic weight'' in the scherzo and ``deliciously seedy
tone'' in the march.) Yet even without relentless coughing from an
audience ridden with flu or boredom, this version would pale
between its inspired neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Not every case is so clear-cut. Barbirolli's version of the
Ninth Symphony, from 1962, is better than his First, admirable
especially in the intensity of the finale, if still no match for
the eloquent Ninths of Bernstein and Herbert von Karajan with the
Berlin Philharmonic, both on Deutsche Grammophon.
</P>
<P>
   And some comparisons fall in favor of the Philharmonic set. The
Tennstedt recording of the Fifth Symphony, from 1980, carrying the
excitement of live performance in full measure, surpasses the 1978
account in the Tennstedt EMI set, though it is similarly marred by
a maddening inconsistency of focus from this intermittently
brilliant interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining items in the Philharmonic set are a surprisingly
genial Fourth Symphony from Solti in 1962, with Irmgard Seefried as
soprano soloist; a vibrant Seventh from Rafael Kubelik in 1981; the
``Purgatorio'' from the 10th Symphony, led by Mitropoulos in 1958,
and the ``Songs of a Wayfarer,'' conducted by William Steinberg and
inimitably sung by Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   This is all worthwhile material that will thrill any serious
Mahlerian, as on many levels it did this one. But it should not be
anyone's only experience of these works. A Bernstein set, either
Deutsche Grammophon's or Sony's, would be the perfect complement.
But if, on the level of these hefty investments, it must be one or
the other, it should probably be Bernstein, with hope kept alive to
add the Philharmonic set later.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it should be fascinating to see what the
Philharmonic, with this inevitable mission satisfactorily if not
ideally accomplished, and with lessons learned in dealing with
recalcitrant record companies and estates of dead maestros, dreams
up next.

   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Accomplishing in just four weeks what the
Massachusetts Legislature could not in several years, the
Connecticut General Assembly Tuesday night agreed to build and
furnish a new $375 million stadium for the New England Patriots as
part of massive revitalization effort for this struggling city.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly five hours of debate during which the decision to
lure the Patriots away from Massachusetts with the richest deal
ever carved for an NFL team appeared to be losing ground, house
lawmakers finally voted 97-49 in favor, handing Patriots owner
Robert Kraft both a financial and philosophical victory. Kraft, who
tried unsuccessfully to build a stadium in Massachusetts, had said
he would be forced to sell the team if he could not find a home for
the club in New England. With this deal, he could become one of the
richest owners in the league, sports analysts have said.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming show of support in the Connecticut house came
after many legislators rose to criticize the unusual speed which
the deal was constructed and put before them as well as its
enormous cost.
</P>
<P>
   But apparently swayed by last-minute changes in the bill, and
desperate for a way to remake this insurance capitol, lawmakers
surprised observers who had been predicting a close tally and
embraced the ambitious plan to have professional football here by
the fall of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the General Assembly's debate began Tuesday Senate
Minority Leader Louis DeLuca, a Woodbury Republican who was
critical of the proposal, seemed to symbolize the feelings of
several colleagues as he pinched his nose, and said he was going to
vote yes.
</P>
<P>
   The final bill, approved at by the House at 7:25 p.m.,
authorizes the state to borrow $274 million for the stadium,
infrastructure improvements and cleanup on the site along the
Connecticut River. Another $100 million in cash from the state's
projected budget surplus was also earmarked to help pay for the
development, part of a $1 billion downtown revitalization effort
known as Adriaen's Landing.
</P>
<P>
   The state Senate was expected to follow suit and approve the
bill later Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   As the day unfolded, lawmakers scrambled Tuesday to make some
changes in the bill, which has been on an unprecedented fast track
here since Governor John Rowland signed an initial agreement with
Kraft on Nov. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Among the last-minute alterations in the legislation:
</P>
<P>
   _ The short time frame for construction and environmental
permitting was stretched from 10 days to more than a month,
compared to a more typical 18-month process;
</P>
<P>
   _ Kraft's tax exempt status for the NFL retail and virtual
reality pavilion he has committed to build as part of the proposal
was revoked;
</P>
<P>
   _ The cap on a state guarantee to pay for unsold luxury seats
was reduced by 25 percent, limiting Connecticut's liability to a
maximum $13 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   While many lawmakers raised objections to the project, even some
who didn't like all the terms said they would vote for it
expressing a seemingly widespread feeling among lawmakers that the
city's economic and psychic needs outweighed the hundreds of
millions the state will pay for just 10 pro football games a year.
</P>
<P>
   With a single protestor standing in the cold outside the state
Capitol carrying a sign that said ``Welcome to the giveaway city,''
the House plowed ahead, asking questions, trying to answer
questions, and struggling with quantifying the value -- financial
and otherwise -- of a football franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers conceded that they did not know how much the
environmental cleanup costs would be for the proposed stadium site,
which is contaminated from a coal gasification plant that once
stood there. Nor could they guarantee that the 68,000-seat open-air
facility could be built on that site, now occupied by a steam
plant, because costs of moving the facility that heats and cools
many downtown office buildings could run too high.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do know that's not the responsibility of Mr. Kraft,'' said
Representative John Wayne Fox, a conservative Democrat from
Stamford. ``This is not a process I'm proud of. What committee
reviewed this? How many public hearings did we have? One? With all
due respect, it was a dog and pony show....What's the matter with
us?''
</P>
<P>
   Hot dog sales jobs, Fox added, will not be enough to bridge the
widening gap between rich and poor in Connecticut, a state with one
of the highest per capita incomes and three of the poorest cities
in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Mushinsky, a Wallingford Democrat, said she was swayed not
to vote on the project by constituents who called her office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next thing Kraft will want to sleep in Mark Twain's bed,'' she
said, referring to the famous one-time Hartford resident and
author.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, Republicans and fiscal conservatives joined with
liberal Democrats to vote for the enormous project.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a reasonable risk,'' said Representative Edward
Graziani, an Ellington Democrat. ``This is not reckless gambling.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Representative Dominic Mazzoccoli, a Newington Republican:
``Mayor Mike, this vote's for you. Merry Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Mike, as Hartford's leader and civic booster Michael
Peters is affectionately known, took an honorary seat on the
chamber rostrum next to House Speaker Thomas Ritter during the
debate, which stretched for hours into the night.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, the chamber erupted in applause and Ritter,
who just cast his final vote before vacating post, lifted a
Patriots T-shirt in celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut, a state desperate to retain more of its young
people and become more than a stop along the way to Boston or New
York, is looking for a linchpin to make Hartford known more for
than the dry business of insurance.
</P>
<P>
   In an interesting twist, some undecided legislators, angered by
spirited cracks against greater Hartford from Massachusetts media,
cast votes for the stadium in spiteful fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Invoking what became a wave of anti-Boston sentiment during
Tuesday's Special Session, Representative Robert Ward, the House
Minority Leader, said the city, which had been dubbed ``the filing
cabinet of the world'' by Globe sports columnist Dan Shaughnessy,
was gladly opening its drawers. Mayor Peters called the
curly-haired Shaughnessy a Chia Pet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not the filing cabinet of America,'' a jubilant Peters
said after the House vote. ``We're not
Chernoble-on-the-Connecticut. If Boston can't deal with it, I'm
sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland, at a Chamber of Commerce breakfast at the start of the
momentus day, read a poem to the tune of `Twas the Night Before
Christmas': ``To the masses in Boston, I just have to laugh, we may
be a bunch of yahoos, but we managed to land the Krafts.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kraft, in an opinion piece in Tuesday's Hartford
Courant, wrote: ``In hindsight, relocating to Hartford is something
we should have done years ago.''

THREE MORE REASONS TO HAIL A NEW RUSSIA  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 20) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAVID MERMELSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Momentous political shifts always breed unintended consequences,
and frequently the changes are cultural. So when the Soviet Union
collapsed a decade ago, it stood to reason that artistic ground
would begin to shift.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of the happier consequences of that nation's
disintegration has been the reappearance in the West of the Russian
singer.
</P>
<P>
   For years, this special breed of artist was largely absent from
European and American view, a casualty of Stalinism, World War II
and cold-war politics. True, exemplars like the contralto Zara
Dolukhanova, the mezzo-soprano Irina Arkhipova and the soprano
Galina Vishnevskaya achieved some popularity in the West, but they
were deployed both as political tools and as artistic ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, not since the czarist era have Russian singers attained
the unfettered mainstream exposure they currently enjoy, once more
regularly appearing in Western opera houses and signing contracts
with major record labels.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most conspicuous example of their resurgence can be
found on the Philips label, on which the indefatigable conductor
Valery Gergiev spearheads a seemingly endless series of Russian
operas, including many obscure works.
</P>
<P>
   Largely as a result of his efforts, several soloists have
emerged as stars in their own right, including the soprano Galina
Gorchakova, the mezzo-soprano Olga Borodina and, to a lesser
extent, the baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky.
</P>
<P>
   Widely popular and critically acclaimed, these three singers
supplement their operatic work with successful recital tours and
have lately signed exclusive contracts with Philips, which is
practically cornering the market on Russian vocalists these days.
</P>
<P>
   And as three recent disks confirm, the label's confidence in
these performers is not misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   On her disk of Russian romances titled ``Memories of Love'' (446
720-2), Ms. Gorchakova, accompanied by a piano, sings bittersweet
works by Balakirev, Glinka, Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov,
Rachmaninoff and Aleksandr Dargomyzhsky, all of which perfectly
suit this soprano's sepulchral timbre.
</P>
<P>
   The Glinka songs make a particularly deep impression. With a
firm, darkly tinted voice, Ms. Gorchakova provides a pointed
melancholy to ``The Lark,'' delivering with the song's last phrase
_ ``Someone will remember me and sigh in secret'' _ with
devastating effect. For ``I Remember the Wonderful Moment,'' based
on a Pushkin text, she alternates between naivete and
worldweariness. And ``You Will Soon Forget Me'' is a study in rue.
But in the high-spirited ``Bolero,'' the soprano breaks with
restraint and opts for gripping abandon.
</P>
<P>
   In Tchaikovsky, too, Ms. Gorchakova impresses. Listeners may
recall the fine performance of the Letter Scene from ``Eugene
Onegin'' that appeared on a Philips disk two years ago. On this new
record, the soprano animates four of the composer's songs,
beginning with a hypnotic lullaby. The three love songs that follow
find a wistful Ms. Gorchakova highlighting the undercurrent of
loneliness pervading the pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Dargomyzhsky's music may not be familiar outside Russia, but his
songs stir the soul as much any on this disk. Few listeners will be
able to resist the passionate pull of ``I Love Him Still,'' for
instance, in which Ms. Gorchakova spins a simple line with
eloquence and dignity. The sentimental ``Sixteen Years'' is no less
involving, recounting a timid girl's first romance.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the attention lavished on his piano concertos, the
songs of Rachmaninoff remain little known. This is a pity, for
there is a mysterious beauty to these miniature dramas. Ms.
Gorchakova captures that sense of atmosphere completely, especially
in ``A Dream'' and ``Lilacs.''
</P>
<P>
   The pianist Larissa Gergieva (a sister of Gergiev) proves an
imaginative accompanist, her painterly touch enhancing the spell
cast by Ms. Gorchakova. Unfortunately, neither artist is helped by
this CDs overly reverberant acoustics, which makes both singer and
pianist sound as if they're performing in a gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Borodina's album, ``Bolero'' (289 446 708-2), also with
piano accompaniment, is ostensibly a Spanish program rather than a
Russian one. But though the record features music by Falla and
Granados (and even Ravel's ``Spanish Song''), the bulk of the disk
is devoted to works by Shostakovich, Glinka, Dargomyzhsky, Anton
Rubinstein and Mark Minkov, all of whom found inspiration in images
of sunny Iberia.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The record begins with a rarity, Shostakovich's colorful
``Spanish Songs,'' six ballads based on poems by two Russians. To
these evocative pieces, Ms. Borodina brings a plummy tone and
plenty of spunk. ``Farewell, Granada,'' finds a woman departing her
homeland after the death of her lover, and ``Little Stars'' tells
of a cheeky youth who trades guitar and astronomy lessons for
kisses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronda'' is a call to make merry, and this mezzo's warm,
inviting tone makes the offer hard to resist. For the tender ``Eyes
of Ebony,'' Ms. Borodina becomes a girl driven to distraction by
unrequited love.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the fire that pervades Ms. Gorchakova's account of
Glinka's ``Bolero,'' Ms. Borodina favors sultriness, and one can
practically see the mezzo shimmying up to some young gallant and
seducing him.
</P>
<P>
   Falla's ``Seven Popular Songs'' are a bold choice for a Russian
singer, but Ms. Borodina, adopting a Castilian lisp, fully steps up
to the challenge. Naturally, her diction is not as idiomatic as
Victoria de los Angeles's, yet the mezzo connects with these
passionate strains.
</P>
<P>
   Even tongue-twisters like ``Seguidilla From Murcia'' do not
defeat her. She brings poignancy to ``Asturian Song'' and a dreamy
calm to ``Lullaby.'' And she presents a searing account of
``Polo,'' one woman's curse on love itself.
</P>
<P>
   Semyon Skigin's assertive piano accompaniment suits Ms.
Borodina's bold approach. He is a gifted player with more than a
few ideas of his own. (Listen to the extra bounce he lends the
introduction to Falla's ``Jota,'' for example.) Yet Skigin proves
no stranger to nuance, either, as his playing on Minkov's bucolic
``Landscape'' shows.
</P>
<P>
   Hvorostovsky is the most famous singer to have emerged from the
former Soviet Union. In 1989, he won the BBC's Cardiff Singer of
the World Competition, beating Bryn Terfel for top honors. His
latest disk, ``Arie Antiche'' (289 456 543-2), with the Academy of
St. Martin-in-the-Fields conducted by Neville Marriner, breaks new
ground by featuring the baritone in Italian arias of the 17th and
18th centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Though the popularity of these ardent works has declined over
the years, Beniamino Gigli, Ezio Pinza, Janet Baker and other
singers memorably recorded many of them, and the pieces _ by both
famous composers like Handel, Gluck and Vivaldi and neglected ones
like Durante, Caccini and Stradella _ have much to recommend them.
A few, like Gluck's ``Che faro senza Euridice?'' and Handel's
``Ombra mai fu,'' have retained their renown, but most will be
unfamiliar to listeners.
</P>
<P>
   Hvorostovsky begins on an exultant note, with Giacomo
Carissimi's ``Vittoria, mio core,'' in which a man heroically
proclaims his freedom from ``love's vile servitude.'' Here, the
plush-voiced baritone is at his swaggering best, dispatching
coloratura with ease. He's no less fine in Vivaldi's ``Se il cor
guerriero,'' where a martial antiwar cry is set against ``Four
Seasons''-like accompaniment.
</P>
<P>
   In Giuseppe Giordani's ``Caro mio ben,'' the baritone delivers a
declaration of love in a resonant, fervent voice, easily displacing
Pinza's late-in-life recording of the song. Yet Hvorostovsky falls
short of the standard set by Gigli's incomparably sensitive
account, now sadly out-of-print.
</P>
<P>
   Vivaldi's ``Orribile lo scempio,'' yet another antiwar jeremiad,
affords the baritone an opportunity for vocal gymnastics, which he
gleefully seizes. Antonio Caldara's sublime ``Selve amiche,'' is
much gentler stuff, with the singer imploring the woods to grant
his aching heart refuge. But though the baritone feels Caldara's
music, he lacks Gigli's clutching desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Gigli also lingers in the memory when hearing Hvorostovsky in
Alessandro Scarlatti's hymn to the sun, ``Gia il sole dal Gange.''
The baritone takes the tune at an impressively speedy clip and
lends it bluff ardor, but he lacks Gigli's gay, celebratory sense.
</P>
<P>
   This CD concludes with Hvorostovsky's plaintive performance of
Alessandro Stradella's ``Pieta, Signore,'' the longest work on the
record. A plea to God's mercy, the piece benefits from the
baritone's supple treatment and exquisite diction. Actually,
Hvorostovsky's Italian is crisply idiomatic throughout the disk.
</P>
<P>
   For support, the baritone couldn't have done better. Marriner
conducted a similar album for Ms. Baker two decades ago, and his
appreciation for these scores seems only to have grown with time.
Under his keen baton, the academy plays in typically polished
fashion, its strings lissome, winds pellucid and brass glinting.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, circumstances would not have permitted Ms.
Gorchakova, Ms. Borodina and Hvorostovsky their international
careers. Now, Western ears regularly seek out the bold, viscous
sonorities of the Russian singer, and a rudely interrupted line
that began when the gramophone was young thrives yet again. How
lucky for music lovers that times have changed.

NFL PANEL REJECTS FOR PLAYOFFS BUT BACKS IT FOR NEXT SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Instant replay for the playoffs is dead, but upon further review
the National Football League's competition committee wants it back
for the 1999 regular season and playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   After a one-hour conference call with commissioner Paul
Tagliabue, the eight-member competition committee, made up of
owners, general managers and coaches, voted by 7-1 against using
instant replay in the playoffs. Only Jerry Jones, the Dallas owner,
wanted replay for the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   But the committee also voted, by a 6-2 margin, to bring back
instant replay next season. The members not in favor of replay were
the Cincinnati owner Mike Brown and the Tampa Bay general manager
Rich McKay.
</P>
<P>
   The competition committee will now examine all forms of replay,
from the coaching challenge system to a more expeditious form of
the replay system used in the late 1980s, then make a
recommendation to owners at meetings in March.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue said he believed that the officiating in the NFL is
solid, but because of the number of replays that fans see on
big-screen televisions in stadiums, as well as multiple replay
angles at home, replay has almost become a necessity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we have great officiating,'' said Tagliabue, who
favors replay for next year. ``I don't think we've had a decline in
officiating; we've had an increase in technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the committee wants instant replay back next season, it
did not want to experiment with it during the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is made up of the owners Jones and Brown; the
general managers McKay, Bill Polian of Indianapolis, and Charley
Casserly of Washington, and the coaches Dennis Green of Minnesota,
Bill Cowher of Pittsburgh and Mike Holmgren of Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The league had a chance to institute replay before this season,
but a proposal was rejected by owners. Then came several recent
embarrassing calls, and the idea of replay for the playoffs burst
to the forefront.
</P>
<P>
   Jets quarterback Vinny Testaverde scored the winning touchdown
on a run against the Seattle Seahawks on Dec. 6, yet television
replays showed Testaverde's knee had touched down before the ball
crossed the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   One week earlier, there were two erroneous calls in Buffalo's
loss to New England.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the calls changed the complexion of the entire
division. The Jets, at 10-4 and in first place in the American
Football Conference East, need only one victory in their last two
games to win the division. If there was replay, the Bills would
likely be leading the division with the Jets in second place
heading into the rematch at Rich Stadium on Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   There is an assumption among many in the NFL, including
Tagliabue, that instant replay will return for the 1999 season. But
it is by no means a lock to do so.
</P>
<P>
   For that to happen, 24 of 31 owners must vote in favor of it.
There have indeed been defectors to the pro-replay camp, including
Buffalo owner Ralph Wilson, who was fined $50,000 for criticizing
the officiating after the Bills' loss to the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the competition committee in favor of replay are
worried because there isn't a consensus among league owners,
general managers and coaches on what form of replay they want. Some
owners want a system that allows a coach to challenge two calls a
game.
</P>
<P>
   But at least one version of the proposed system involves the use
of timeouts, and there are coaches like Bill Parcells of the Jets
who hate using them for replay. Tagliabue said no one should
``declare the coaching challenge system dead today,'' but added
there is growing sentiment against it.
</P>
<P>
   Other owners and team executives like the system used from
1986-91, when a replay official in a booth reviewed the play and
communicated his ruling to officials on the field, who then
announced if a call was reversed. While that process was heavily
criticized as too cumbersome, some owners think it can be trimmed
to a more efficient procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue added he intends to ask former referees to see if the
system of grading officials can be improved. Officials recently
told players and coaches that the grading system is too harsh.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco quarterback Steve Young said that during a game
this year, an official told him that he was forced to call a
penalty against the 49ers because he would receive a stern memo
from the league office if he did not.  &QL;

RACE CARD NO DUNK IN THIS GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID LEIBOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Finally, truly, the country's basketball war has turned absurd.
Finally, hopefully, we fans in the not-cheap-enough seats will find
the gumption to say to the players and owners both exactly what
demands saying.
</P>
<P>
   Not, ``Oh, please settle the lockout.''
</P>
<P>
   But instead, ``Dear Lord in heaven, please stay out!''
</P>
<P>
   For a season, at least. Or, even better, until the end of time.
</P>
<P>
   America needs these two sets of self-important, whining
greedheads, determined slayers of the golden goose, about as much
as Rep. J.D. Hayworth needs a second mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Or Bill Clinton, the Confessor in Chief, needs to hike his
Viagra dosage.
</P>
<P>
   The backbreaking moment for the NBA came Sunday night, when the
latest issue of ``Newsweek'' hit the street. Until that point, the
basketball lockout had been characterized mostly by fan apathy,
boring news reports and negotiating ineptitude. Enter Alonzo
Mourning of the Miami Heat.
</P>
<P>
   Who can't play hoop well enough to win a title or a big game,
but who certainly plays the race card like a champ.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a perception from the owners even to some
fans that we're Blacks who should be happy with what we got, fair
or not,'' Mourning said. ``I'm not saying it's all about race
because it's not _ but it plays a factor.'' &QL; 
ANALYSIS BAD AS SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   This was seconded by noted sociologist Sam Cassell, who's
enslaved by the New Jersey Nets when he's not busy conducting
psychosocial analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the owners look at us as Black, ghetto guys with tons
of money that we don't deserve,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Garbage. Not as bad as Cassell's shot selection most nights, but
close.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA's lily-White ownership may be a lot of things _
arrogant, cash-obsessed, short on common sense, lacking in
self-restraint, corporate-hearted _ but racist doesn't make the
list. Give the owners some credit: They may be in the midst of
killing their sport, but not before they built a multibillion-buck
business from a game with 90 percent minority players, each earning
an average of $2.6 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   That same business discriminates against Alonzo Mourning to the
tune of $105 million over seven years.
</P>
<P>
   We should all be so painfully indentured.
</P>
<P>
   So disrespected. So kept down.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as a side effect, we might all suffer from Mourning's
disease: Nine digits of separation.
</P>
<P>
   From reality.
</P>
<P>
   What Mourning and his cohorts see as race-tinged, the rest of us
see as lunacy _ not ``Blacks who should be happy,'' but ``fools who
are unhappy,'' with riches and adulation, unfathomable job security
and inestimable perks. &QL; 
NO LOSS IF NBA DIES
</P>
<P>
   No thinking fan dislikes you for your skin, Alonzo. They dislike
you and the owners for seeming so small and so ungrateful in the
face of such plentitude.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same reason no one can find a side to root for in this
fiasco. The same reason basketball ought to just go away.
</P>
<P>
   We would lose nothing tangible in its absence, nothing vital.
Only some entertainment, a commodity already much overvalued
America-wide.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood would fill the minuscule void, if there was one. You
could buy two good novels instead of your one nosebleed seat. Or,
hell, go to a college game. Most of those players get paid in cars
and cash, not in checks that resemble the gross national product.
</P>
<P>
   Though I've loved basketball since childhood, it is still only a
game, merely a sport. Not a reflection of society, or an addition
to it, but, increasingly, an aberration, a drain of money, time and
attention.
</P>
<P>
   With the NBA, there is so much not to like, and all of it has to
do with avarice and priority and values.
</P>
<P>
   Not skin color.
</P>
<P>
   The only race in basketball is to see how far away we can get
from the game, and how fast. Every last fan should run like the
wind. &QL;

IRAQ ACCUSED OF ARMS VIOLATIONS THAT COULD RESULT IN AIR STRIKES 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The chief U.N. arms inspector Tuesday accused Iraq of failing to
cooperate with inspections of its weapons programs, pushing
President Saddam Hussein toward a new military confrontation with
the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Only a month after Iraq averted an American-led attack by
pledging at the last minute to resume full cooperation, Richard
Butler, the chairman of the U.N. Special Commission overseeing the
disarmament of Iraq, declared in a report delivered to the Security
Council Tuesday night that Saddam's government continues to
obstruct inspections.
</P>
<P>
   He accused Iraq of failing to turn over documents that would
shed light on the development of chemical and biological weapons
and barring surprise inspections at a headquarters of Saddam's
Baath Party in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, officials responded grimly to Butler's report,
reiterating the administration's warnings that it was prepared to
respond to Iraqi noncompliance with force if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the House of Representatives' consideration of
four articles of impeachment against him, Clinton now faces a
decision on whether to order American forces into action against
Saddam. Clinton, returning to Washington Tuesday night from a
four-day trip to Israel, is scheduled to meet with his senior
national security aides Wednesday to decide how to respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand this report is very troubling,'' a senior
administration official said Tuesday night, speaking on the
condition of anonymity. ``It finds a lack of compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the timing of any strikes, the official replied
simply, ``We'll set the timetable; not the United Nations and not
Saddam Hussein.''
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating Butler's conclusions, the president's national
security aides had already held a series of meetings, beginning on
Sunday. Secretary of Defense William Cohen and the chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry H. Shelton, postponed their
departures on separate trips to Europe over the weekend, though
their aides cited budget negotiations as the reason.
</P>
<P>
   One government official said the White House had asked military
commanders on the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the U.S. Central
Command to reactivate plans that were put on hold on Nov. 14 only
15 minutes before an attack was to begin.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, with Britain, had been prepared to launch a
first strike of nearly 300 cruise missiles from eight warships in
the Persian Gulf, followed by bombing raids from dozens of F-14 and
F-18 fighters aboard the aircraft carrier Dwight D. Eisenhower and
then from B-52 and B-1 bombers sent to the region.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called off that attack against the advice of most of his
national security team, including Cohen and Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, who argued that Iraq could not be trusted to
keep promises it had made and broken before.
</P>
<P>
   All the firepower the United States was prepared to let loose on
Iraq in November remains in the Persian Gulf. In fact, the Pentagon
has taken steps in recent days that have had the effect of
increasing the amount of weaponry temporarily, coinciding with
Butler's review.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Pentagon announced that it was sending eight
B-52's to replace seven now based on Diego Garcia, the British isle
in the Indian Ocean. Between now and Christmas, all 15 B-52's will
remain in the region.
</P>
<P>
   A group of nine warships led by the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson
is expected to arrive in the Persian Gulf by the end of the week,
joining the carrier Enterprise and 14 other combat warships in the
gulf, eight of them able to fire Tomahawk cruise missiles.

RACE CARD NO DUNK IN THIS GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Finally, truly, the country's basket ball war has turned absurd.
Finally, hopefully, we fans in the not-cheap-enough seats will find
the gumption to say to the players and owners both exactly what
demands saying.
</P>
<P>
   Not, ``Oh, please settle the lockout.''
</P>
<P>
   But instead, ``Dear Lord in heaven, please stay out!''
</P>
<P>
   For a season, at least. Or, even better, until the end of time.
</P>
<P>
   America needs these two sets of self-important, whining
greedheads, determined slayers of the golden goose, about as much
as Rep. J.D. Hayworth needs a second mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Or Bill Clinton, the Confessor in Chief, needs to hike his
Viagra dosage.
</P>
<P>
   The backbreaking moment for the NBA came Sunday night, when the
latest issue of ``Newsweek'' hit the street. Until that point, the
basket ball lockout had been characterized mostly by fan apathy,
boring news reports and negotiating ineptitude. Enter Alonzo
Mourning of the Mi ami Heat.
</P>
<P>
   Who can't play hoop well enough to win a title or a big game,
but who certainly plays the race card like a champ.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a perception from the owners even to some
fans that we're Blacks who should be happy with what we got, fair
or not,'' Mourning said. ``I'm not saying it's all about race
because it's not _ but it plays a factor.'' &QL; 
ANALYSIS BAD AS SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   This was seconded by noted sociolo gist Sam Cassell, who's
enslaved by the New Jersey Nets when he's not busy conducting
psychosocial analy sis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the owners look at us as Black, ghetto guys with tons
of money that we don't deserve,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Garbage. Not as bad as Cassell's shot selection most nights, but
close.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA's lily-White ownership may be a lot of things _
arrogant, cash-obsessed, short on common sense, lacking in
self-restraint, corpo rate-hearted _ but racist doesn't make the
list. Give the owners some credit: They may be in the midst of
killing their sport, but not before they built a multibillion-buck
busi ness from a game with 90 percent minority players, each
earning an average of $2.6 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   That same business discriminates against Alonzo Mourning to the
tune of $105 million over seven years.
</P>
<P>
   We should all be so painfully inden tured.
</P>
<P>
   So disrespected. So kept down.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as a side effect, we might all suffer from Mourning's
disease: Nine digits of separation.
</P>
<P>
   From reality.
</P>
<P>
   What Mourning and his cohorts see as race-tinged, the rest of us
see as lunacy _ not ``Blacks who should be happy,'' but ``fools who
are unhappy,'' with riches and adulation, unfathomable job security
and inesti mable perks. NO LOSS IF NBA DIES
</P>
<P>
   No thinking fan dislikes you for your skin, Alonzo. They dislike
you and the owners for seeming so small and so ungrateful in the
face of such plentitude.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same reason no one can find a side to root for in this
fiasco. The same reason basketball ought to just go away.
</P>
<P>
   We would lose nothing tangible in its absence, nothing vital.
Only some entertainment, a commodity already much overvalued
America-wide.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood would fill the minuscule void, if there was one. You
could buy two good novels instead of your one nosebleed seat. Or,
hell, go to a college game. Most of those players get paid in cars
and cash, not in checks that resemble the gross na tional product.
</P>
<P>
   Though I've loved basketball since childhood, it is still only a
game, merely a sport. Not a reflection of society, or an addition
to it, but, increasingly, an aberration, a drain of money, time and
attention.
</P>
<P>
   With the NBA, there is so much not to like, and all of it has to
do with avarice and priority and values.
</P>
<P>
   Not skin color.
</P>
<P>
   The only race in basketball is to see how far away we can get
from the game, and how fast. Every last fan should run like the
wind.

 New Macs: iBlinking Swiftness  &HT;       
 By Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Apple Computer soon will buff up its &LR;   &LR; top-of-the-line Macintoshes
with new models that meld the elegant design of the iMac with
blur-fast speed, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cupertino company may debut the new Macs next month at the
Macworld Expo trade show in Moscone Center, and ship them by the
end of January. Apple is positioning the new machines, code-named
Yosemite, as successors to the popular Power Mac G3 models for
publishers. Sources said they will come in blue, sport a curved
look and boast microprocessing speeds of up to 333 and 400 MHz.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  The new desktop models are expected to be priced in line with
Apple's current G3 machines, which range from $1,600 to $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apple is making a dramatic bid to court its core audience of
creative professionals with these new machines,'' said Matthew
Rothenberg, content director at MacWEEK.com in San Francisco.
``After greatly shoring up its consumer market with the iMac, it's
time to address the high end.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Apple officials declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  But interim Apple CEO Steve Jobs has repeatedly said Apple is
simplifying its product line so that it can introduce new Macs
every nine months _ rather than the customary 18 months it used to
take. The Power Mac G3 line debuted in November 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Apple is even dropping hints on its Web site ( &LR; store.apple.com &LR; )
of possible new desktop models. Customers who click on the picture
of the Power Mac G3, receive the following message: ``Due to
extremely strong Q1 sales, Apple has sold all Power Mac G3 systems
available, including servers and displays, through the quarter end.
Not to worry, in early January there will be plenty of Power Mac G3
systems, from entry to high-end configurations, including servers
and displays, to meet your demands.''
</P>
<P>
   The message tacitly acknowledges that current G3 models are out
of production and new ones are on the way, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The new computers are expected to dominate product news at the
semiannual Macintosh trade show, where Apple also is expected to
ship an update of its QuickTime multimedia technology and show off
Final Cut, a digital-video editing system it acquired from
Macromedia.
</P>
<P>
   What is less likely is a glimpse of WebMate, a portable version
of the iMac, due in the first half of next year. Expected to cost
about $1,500, it would be aimed at the same type of consumers who
have snapped up iMac, Apple's all-in-one Internet Mac. Also waiting
in the wings is a turbo-charged iMac, which would come with more
memory and computing power than its aquamarine-colored predecessor.
Sources said it may appear in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   But the new G3 Macs could spice up interest at Macworld Expo and
help further aid a financial turnaround, observers said.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent phone interview, Jobs cringed when recalling the
state of the company he inherited as interim CEO last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a mess,'' he said. ``People were told they were losers,
and they believed it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But things have changed, and Apple is back on track,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the credit goes to Steve (Jobs),'' said analyst Charles
Wolf of Credit Suisse First Boston in New York. ``He knows the
company better than anyone else and has made the right strategic
and product decisions. He has that company focused.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, Jobs considers himself a ``talent scout.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is team sports,'' he said in an interview last month at
his modest Pixar Animation Studios' office. ``It's about getting
the best people. The collection of talent we have at Apple is as
good as it's ever been. That has as much to do with Apple's success
as anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Jobs' command, the company has streamlined its product
line and cut costs to put Apple back in the black. A good deal of
the company's recent good fortunes are due to brisk sales of the
high-margin Power Mac G3 and the iMac.
</P>
<P>
   Apple rang up profits of $309 million ($2.10 per share) on sales
of $5.9 billion in its 1998 fiscal year, which ended September 25.
In the previous year, it lost $1 billion ($8.29) on sales of $7.1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock, in the meantime, is hovering near a
three-year high. Yesterday, it closed at $33.56, up $1.06. A year
ago, Apple shares were trading in the low 20s.
</P>
<P>
   In late October, Apple held its first meeting with financial
analysts in nearly two years to outline a five-step ``renewal
process,'' according to a report by Gillian Munson of Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   At the New York briefing, Munson wrote, Apple CFO Fred Anderson
said the PC-maker currently is working on stages three through five
of the following comeback plan: 1) survival, 2)
stability/profitability, 3) setting a product strategy, 4)
regaining application support for Apple platforms and 5) driving
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs described such a ``hierarchy of survival'' _ based on
Abraham Maslow's ranking of societal needs _ at the Macworld Expo
trade show last summer in New York.

 Chevron Plans Job Cuts  &HT;       
 By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
To combat sinking oil prices and boost profits, Chevron Corp.
announced yesterday that it will reduce expenses by $500 million
next year, in part through ``modest'' job cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Like other oil giants, San Francisco's Chevron has been under
pressure to cut costs as the price of crude oil has slumped to
$11.55 a barrel from close to $19 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron has 34,000 employees, including about 8,000 in the Bay
Area. Sources close to the company expect that about 1,500 jobs
could be cut in the United States while 500 new positions are added
at such hot prospects overseas as Kazakstan and West Africa. That
would result in a net reduction of about 1,000 positions.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting with security analysts in New York, Chevron Chairman
Kenneth Derr said Chevron would cut its 1999 capital to $5.1
billion _ 8 percent below this year's projected budget _ and focus
more on attractive overseas prospects than ones in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Derr declined to comment specifically on the merger plans of
Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp., or rumors that Chevron might be
talking with Royal Dutch/Shell Group.
</P>
<P>
   Restating his company's position that it ``will consider mergers
or acquisitions as one possible way to improve business results,''
Derr declared, ``It is not necessary for Chevron to merge with a
competitor to continue to provide top returns to our shareholders.
We need to &UR;  &LR; execute our business plan.''
</P>
<P>
   That means slashing about 10 percent of the $5 billion operating
budget of the fourth-largest U.S. oil company. Capital spending
cuts will occur primarily in Chevron's North American production
and exploration business, where the budget is being slashed to $1.1
billion from $1.3 billion this year. The company expects to make
other major cuts in refining, marketing and chemicals and sell off
some assets like its P&AMP;M coal business in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Chevron named Dave O'Reilly vice chairman to
spearhead the expense-reduction drive. O'Reilly indicated that
since 1991, Chevron has cut more than $2 billion in annual
operating expenses. Along the way, it reduced its payroll from
52,000 to 34,000, in part by selling off businesses like Ortho
consumer products and agricultural chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   During the past seven years, the number of Bay Area employees
has been cut by more than a third to about 8,000.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron spokesman Mike Libbey could not say where layoffs might
occur. He noted that the company eliminated about 400 of 1,700
jobs, many of them in San Ramon, when it decided to ``outsource''
much of its information technology business a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron currently has 2,700 employees at its Richmond refinery
and research labs, 2,400 working for chemical and other operations
in San Ramon, 1,400 in San Francisco, 1,300 at the Concord data
processing center and about 250 in Walnut Creek working on trading
and finance.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron said it plans to invest 73 percent of its capital budget
to look for and produce oil and gas, including $2.6 billion
overseas and $1.1 billion in the United States. The major U.S.
projects are in the Gulf of Mexico, including the half-mile deep
Genesis platform that is expected to start production in January.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron also plans to spend $870 million on refining and
marketing, including $540 million in the United States, where it is
upgrading its 7,899 service stations.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron shares lost $2.69 to close at $83 yesterday.

   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Concluding that big-league status was worth an
expensive gamble, the Connecticut House of Representatives voted
Tuesday night to build a $375 million stadium for the New England
Patriots in downtown Hartford and committed millions more to help
fill it.
</P>
<P>
   The 97-49 vote came after five hours of debate during a one-day
special session of the General Assembly, with opponents complaining
that the bill had been rushed and that crucial details remained
unknown. State Senate leaders said they expected the bill to pass,
and Gov. John G. Rowland has said he would sign the bill in about a
week.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will give Hartford one of 31 National Football League
franchises, a status that even local boosters had considered to be
a pipe dream just a month ago. ``This will change the landscape of
Hartford and the way we look at our capital city for the rest of
our lives,'' Rowland declared.
</P>
<P>
   Several leading sports economists said the package was extremely
generous to the Patriots and constituted the most lucrative lease
ever won by the owner of a professional team. During Tuesday's
debate, opponents worried that the stadium would tie legislators'
hands for years to come and load more debt onto a state with a
below-average credit rating.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the fleecing of Connecticut,'' said state Rep. John
Wayne Fox, a Democrat from Stamford. ``It is unconscionable that we
would incur this unknown expense. We don't have answers to our
liability, to certain basic questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who favored the stadium countered that it was a chance to
transform Hartford's blighted riverfront and generate excitement in
the city, the nation's insurance capital, which has had little to
cheer for in the decades that manufacturing plants have been moving
out and corporations have been consolidating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sends a message to out-of-state businesses that Hartford is
not a city that's going to lay down and die,'' Rep. Edward C.
Graziani, a Democrat from Ellington, said during Tuesday's debate.
``You will have tens of millions of people seeing on their screen
the city of Hartford.''
</P>
<P>
   A group of House Democrats failed in their effort to retain the
rights to sell the stadium's name, which will go to the Patriots
and can be worth tens of millions of dollars. ``We are funding the
stadium 100 percent, but we're not recognizing any of the
benefits,'' said Rep. Stephen Dargan.
</P>
<P>
   Renee A. Boicourt, managing director for state ratings at
Moody's Investors Service, said the vote moved Connecticut in the
opposite direction of many states during the current economic boom
by adding debt instead of paying it. ``This move will compound an
already weak financial picture, and take away some of the long-term
upside potential,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the agreement, the state will build a $350
million open-air stadium on the Connecticut River and provide it to
the team rent free for 30 years. The team is assured a profit by a
provision that requires the state to pay as much as $13 million a
year if luxury seats or suites go unsold.
</P>
<P>
   State budget officials estimate that, considering inflation,
those guarantees will amount to $1 billion over the 30 years of the
lease. But the state and Patriots owner Robert Kraft have vowed to
work together to sell the seats so that few, if any, guarantees
will ever have to be paid.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium, which will have 68,000 seats and a grass field, is
supposed to be ready by the fall of 2001, but state officials have
told the Patriots that the completion date could well slip by a
season. The stadium, which will be shared with the University of
Connecticut, will provide a centerpiece for a long-dreamed-of
development known as Adriaen's Landing, which is to include a
hotel, shops and a convention center.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Connecticut officials had feared that they were being
used as a bargaining chip by Kraft, who had spent years trying to
negotiate a subsidy for a new stadium from the Massachusetts
legislature. But Kraft said Tuesday that he would not give
Massachusetts a chance to match the Connecticut offer. ``If it's
passed, we're coming,'' he said Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The project faces several more hurdles. A steam plant is now on
the land and moving it could cost as much as $100 million _ none of
which is included in the budget for the stadium. The ground is also
contaminated with coal tar left over from a gas plant that operated
there from the late 1800s until 1950.

 Breaking Up A Firm Is Hard to Do  &HT;       
 By Peter Sinton  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; QUESTION: &LR;  I own 60 percent of a business and want to break up with
my partner who is nonresponsive to my messages, has not followed up
on leads and has bounced two checks in our business account. I have
offered to reimburse her out-of-pocket expenses to end our S Corp.
but she says I also need to pay for her 40 percent share. The
company has not made a profit, so theoretically it is worthless. My
question is how can I end this partnership and move on? In the
meantime I have started a new sole-proprietor company so that I can
continue to try to make my concept work.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; Answer: &LR;  In business as in marriage, breaking up is hard to
do and many partners don't spend enough time planning for the worst
instead of the best.
</P>
<P>
   As the majority shareholder in a corporation, you can elect
unilaterally to dissolve the corporation, says San Francisco
attorney Michael Casey Walker. But that doesn't mean there won't be
a fight over the remains.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders holding at least 50 percent of a corporation may
voluntarily decide to dissolve at any time. Your corporate by-laws
may spell out procedural requirements for dissolution and notice.
Typically, all shareholders and creditors must be advised. The
secretary of state or other state agency responsible for
establishing your corporation must be notified, too.
</P>
<P>
   You will need to file a certificate showing that the election to
dissolve was made by the shareholders and signed by the majority of
voting shareholders. A California corporation cannot be dissolved
until the California Franchise Tax Board certifies that all
corporate taxes have been paid.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate creditors must be paid off and if there are assets
left, they should be distributed to the shareholders based on their
ownership position and contribution to the business.
</P>
<P>
   Just because your business is not making money doesn't mean it
it is worthless. Nor does it mean that your partner deserves to get
back exactly what she put in.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps your corporate agreement sets out procedures for
appraising the business in case of dissolution. It should. But if
it doesn't, you will have to try to reach an agreement with your
partner or go to court.
</P>
<P>
   Walker offers one other warning. You may be on thin ice
establishing a sole proprietorship before dissolving your current
business. ``A director of a corporation owes a duty of loyalty to
the corporation and cannot usurp opportunities by competing with
the corporation in the same business lines,'' he warned. Your
partner could sue you for keeping business for yourself that should
go to the corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Pension Planning
</P>
<P>
   Q:  &LR; My previous employer provided a pension plan that allowed &LR; 
 &LR; up to half of contributions to be used for certain investments. &LR; 
 &LR; (I borrowed $30,000 to pay the deposit on my home and pay &LR;   &LR; myself
back at 6 percent interest.) Last December, I &LR;   &LR; incorporated (S
Corp) and my previous employer would prefer &LR;   &LR; that I remove the
funds from his plan but has given me some &LR;   &LR; leeway in timing. How
do I move these funds while retaining the &LR;   &LR; ability to borrow
against them, and how do I handle the amount &LR;   &LR; I still owe to my
fund? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A: Your former employer should continue to grant you leeway
about withdrawing your funds. Pension plan participants with more
than a $5,000 balance cannot be forced out unless they reach
retirement age, die or the plan terminates, says retirement
planning expert Stephen Dobrow, president of Primark Benefits in
Burlingame. Most likely, you can leave your account with the prior
employer until you reach age 591/2.
</P>
<P>
   However, if your former employer doesn't want the hassle of
handling your loan payments, it can adopt a provision that requires
you to either repay the loan or be taxed on the outstanding
balance. A careful review of the plan and the loan documentation
may reveal these details.
</P>
<P>
   If you elected regular C Corporation status for your new company
and adopted an appropriate profit sharing plan, your loan could be
directly transferred to the new plan and you can enjoy
contributions, withdrawals and payments as before. (This new plan
must be qualified under Section 401(a) of the federal tax code; a
Simplified Employer Pension or SEP allows neither transfers nor
loans.)
</P>
<P>
   Unsolicited warning: The 6 percent interest rate you have been
charging yourself on the borrowed funds is too low; it should be
the prime interest rate plus 1 percent or 2 percent, according to
Dobrow. ``You can't give yourself a sweetheart deal with a pension
loan,'' he says. ``Cross your fingers you don't get caught by the
Department of Labor or the IRS.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, you can borrow half of the total in your plan, but only up
to $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Part-Time Help
</P>
<P>
   Q:  &LR; We're a start-up Internet software company with an &LR;   &LR; opening
for a part-time business and marketing position and &LR;   &LR; would like to
offer a competitive salary without going &LR;   &LR; overboard. How do we
find the right person and pay the right &LR;   &LR; price? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; A: Many small-business experts believe understanding your
market and knowing how to address it is one of the primary
responsibilities of the founding team. ``This skill is difficult to
find on a part-time basis,'' says San Francisco attorney Rob
Dellenbach. In the short term he suggests checking consultants who
assist Internet companies with marketing. Be sure to check
references and ask about prior successes.
</P>
<P>
   You might contact friendly Internet companies that offer
complimentary services and find out who they use and what they pay.
Also check the classified ads or help wanted sections of
information technology trade books. But be warned: listed salaries
are not always the final salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Brandt, president of the San Francisco consulting firm
Strategic Technologies Inc., suggests that headhunters can give you
an idea of how much it would cost to fill your position. Beware
that executive search firms usually fill permanent positions and
extract a significant fee.
</P>
<P>
   If you are looking for a seasoned veteran, someone who has been
VP of marketing for a successful startup or the entrepreneurial
division of a larger company, be prepared to pay $120,000 to
$180,000 or half that for a half-time position, Brandt says.
</P>
<P>
   Compensation schedules for particular positions are scarce but
you might know someone at an accounting/consulting firm like Arthur
Andersen or Coopers &AMP; Lybrand that conduct periodic surveys of key
personnel and are familiar with compensation packages.
</P>
<P>
   Granting stock options to employees and stock warrants to
consultants is one way cash-starved startups can conserve money.
Someone who has been successful in the past may not have urgent
cash needs and might be willing to forgo current compensation for
future stock benefits. Dellenbach says you can protect yourself
from giving away too much by making sure that employees and
consultants serve ``at will.'' That way, their grants are
structured in such a way that they receive increasing portions as
long as they remain with the company.

 Recording Industry Tries Out New Tune  &HT;       
 By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
The recording industry yesterday launched a new attempt to stamp
out music piracy, but quickly drew fire from Internet music fans.
</P>
<P>
   The heads of five major record labels, as expected, launched a
new coalition of music and technology firms to decide how to
distribute digital music while protecting artists' royalties and
industry revenues.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The Secure Digital Music Initiative, or SDMI, coalition hopes
to devise a way to protect copyrighted music in time for next
Christmas, though further details about how the new standard will
work were scarce.
</P>
<P>
   The move, announced at a New York press conference, comes in
response to a spate of new digital-music technologies that allow
consumers to reproduce and distribute CD-quality music over the
Internet without paying royalties to the $13 billion music
industry. Most prominent is MP3, a free audio compression format
that has gained popularity through a grassroots Internet movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``In computer-speak, we would call (the plan) `vapor-ware,'
because there was no meat there,'' said Michael Robertson, founder
of a popular Web site, MP3.com, that offers songs in the MP3
format.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said he think the music industry is trying to force
the Internet community to adopt its anti-copying standard. ``For 50
years, the music industry has had a lock on (music distribution)
and for the first time, the Internet is breaking up that
stranglehold.''
</P>
<P>
   The record companies said they weren't necessarily trying to
stamp out MP3.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition will start meeting next month. Technology
companies like Microsoft, Toshiba, Lucent and America Online will
join with music companies like Sony Music Entertainment, Warner
Bros., BMG Entertainment, EMI Recorded Music and Universal Music
Group, to create standards that can be applied to any existing
digital audio technology, including MP3, Liquid Audio and a2b.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about the recording industry imposing a standard on
technology companies,'' said Hilary Rosen, president of the
Recording Industry Association of America. ``We'll simply provide
guidance on the needs of our industry and its customers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``SDMI will enable all of us to continue business in a safer and
much more secure environment,'' said Sony CEO Tommy Mottola.
</P>
<P>
   Liquid Audio, a two-year-old Redwood City company that is
promoting its own proprietary digital technology, hailed the
development.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that's long overdue,'' said Bill Woods,
Liquid Audio marketing director. ``We want to get our music to the
fans, but in a way that's legally responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Hardie, a senior entertainment industry analyst with
Forrester Research of Cambridge, Mass., said the recording
industry's new coalition ``was extremely disappointing because they
didn't say anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry is facing a new distribution channel where they
have no control,'' said Hardie, who noted there are already about
20 million MP3 players and other related programs in use.

JOYFUL NOISE: A KID TALKING WITH SANTA  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I could understand the mother's reluctance. After all, a
stranger was calling with a deeper-than-normal voice and asking to
speak with her 4-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, may I ask who's calling?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Santa Claus.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh. Well that's different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason!'' she yelled, ``There's a really important phone call
for you!''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows that this is the busy time of year for Santa. Big
run on toys and all that. But wouldn't it be great _ to say nothing
of reassuring _ for a kid to get a personal call from the jolly old
elf?
</P>
<P>
   That's the idea behind Santa's Calling, a program sponsored by
Tempe Parks and Recreation and the Retirees of Tempe As sociation.
Of course, Santa himself was too tied up to yak on the phone, but,
much like the Santa's helpers who sit in at malls everywhere,
volunteers came to the Pyle Adult Activity Center over the weekend
and called kids for him.
</P>
<P>
   Parents knew about the calls and had filled out forms with some
pertinent facts about the kids and their Christmas wishes. Hey,
it's Santa who knows who's been naughty and nice and all that, not
the rest of us. &QL; 
THAT'S `DASHER,' WITH A `D'
</P>
<P>
   Armed with that information, as well as a cheat sheet that
included the names of all eight reindeer, a handful of people
manned the phones. I did, as well, and I've got to say, if you're
looking for a heavy dose of Christmas spirit, I can't think of a
better place to find it.
</P>
<P>
   Take the call to Jason, for instance. He was so excited, he
nearly hyperventilated. Sure, he told me what he wanted: a game,
some Christmas money and (maybe a lit tle embarrassingly) a teddy
bear _ but it was the way he told me that made me want to hang
stockings by the chimney with care.
</P>
<P>
   Every word was fraught with impor tance, since it was crucial
that I under stand exactly what he wanted. If there weren't visions
of sugar plums dancing in his head, he certainly faked it well.
</P>
<P>
   His favorite Christmas carol is The Lit tle Drummer Boy, he
said. Could he sing a little? Sure, but the only part he could
remember was, ``fum, fum, fum.''
</P>
<P>
   The volunteers had worked out a plan for exiting the
conversations. We had sleigh bells, which we jingled; the rein deer
were restless and needed to be fed. So after a while, I gave the
bells a shake, and BAM! Jason was in Christmas over drive,
shrieking about the reindeer and Santa to his sisters, who would
soon come to the phone.
</P>
<P>
   You just can't beat sleigh bells for blasting a kid into the
holiday strato sphere. If Jason got a lick of sleep Satur day
night, I'd be surprised. &QL; 
HONESTLY GOOD
</P>
<P>
   A standard question, of course, was asking the children if
they'd been good. I expected Clinton-like answers, avoiding the
real issue. But I was happily surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' 9-year-old Ari said. ``Have I been good?''
</P>
<P>
   What are you going to say to that? I had just enjoyed her
warbling the sweetest two-line version of Silent Night I've ever
heard. ``Yes'' was the only answer I could think of.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goody!'' she squealed.
</P>
<P>
   As for honesty, it's hard to beat 6-year-old Jeremy's response.
Of course he's been good, he said _ ``I know you've been watching
me.''
</P>
<P>
   When it came time to hang up with Jeremy, he turned the tables
and started asking the questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are the elves?'' In the work shop, ho, ho, ho.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you in the workshop?'' Uh, no, in my office. I had to give
the sleigh bells another quick jingle before we got into questions
I couldn't answer.
</P>
<P>
   Not every call was so successful, at least from Santa's
perspective. Four-year-old Kalina asked one question: ``Are you
Santa Claus?'' Of course. And with that she dropped the phone and
left. Her mom coaxed her back, but only for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's so excited,'' her mom said, laughing, after the
happy-but-shy Kalina bolted for the second time.
</P>
<P>
   No kidding. Going to be a long wait till the 25th at their
house, I'll bet.
</P>
<P>
   I'm glad I could help. &QL;

 Cleaning Up the Streets  &HT;       
 By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Plagued by aggressive street people and annoyed customers, Cody's
Books owner Andy Ross figures his well-known Berkeley business lost
$200,000 in the first 10 months of this year as sales slipped 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Telegraph Avenue has had its ups and downs but this has been
the worst year ever,'' said Ross. ``The way things were going, we
couldn't continue to do business.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems along the busy shopping corridor south of the
University of California campus went beyond rudeness. Ross recalls
one day a 64-year-old woman was bitten by a dog in front of his
store. Another afternoon, two women stripped and started whipping
each other.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two months, though, the Telegraph Avenue retail
scene has improved a lot thanks to greater police patrols, drug
busts and a new city ordinance banning lying on the sidewalks. Ross
and his fellow retailers expect things to get even better in
February when the new Telegraph Avenue Business Improvement
District begins to shell out $269,000 a year for ``broom
brigades,'' ``graffiti tag-out teams'' and other services.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign in Berkeley is not unique. To combat vandals and
vagrants, a growing number of merchants, property owners and city
governments are mounting campaigns to clean up specific shopping
districts.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,200 North American cities have created business
improvement districts, where land owners and their tenants assess
themselves to pay for extra services like cleaning streets and
sidewalks, removing graffiti and providing additional security and
social services.
</P>
<P>
   In Northern California a few dozen cities including San Jose and
Sacramento have had BIDs for years. Now more communities are
jumping on the bandwagon:
</P>
<P>
   _ Two weeks ago, the San Francisco Supervisors' Finance
Committee endorsed proposals to spend nearly $1 million annually
over five years to spruce up a 10-block area around Powell Street
from Market to Sutter. The Union Square Business Improvement
District comes up for a full vote by the board of supervisors next
month.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last January, Oakland neighborhood merchants initiated a
business improvement district along a two-block stretch of
Lakeshore Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent survey, 42 percent of small businesses in the Los
Angeles area said graffiti and vandalism were a problem. There has
been no similar poll of Bay Area merchants, who also have to deal
with homeless in their doorways, aggressive panhandlers, sprayed
walls, etched windows, litter and shoplifting. But the sentiment
appears to be much the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of customers don't want to endanger themselves,'' said
Deepak Singh, owner of Kathmandu Imports, who continually battles
graffiti and street people in his doorway at Telegraph near Dwight
Way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business is slow,'' added Yoon Kwon, manager of Pier Luggage
on Powell Street in San Francisco. ``The Asian economy hasn't
helped the tourist business and the tourists who do come are
bothered by people asking them for money.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, it increasingly has fallen on property
owners and merchants to deal with these problems. ``Redevelopment
agencies have been running out of money,'' said BID consultant
Nancy Hormann of Sherman Oaks (Los Angeles County). ``Business
improvement districts that assess themselves have been filling the
gap.''
</P>
<P>
   Merchants can take individual action, Hormann noted, but BIDs
``create a unified voice and economies of scale.''
</P>
<P>
   New York city alone has more than 30 BIDs, including the much
publicized one that cleaned up Times Square. In California, there
are close to 200 BIDs, including about 20 based on property
assessments and devoted to making areas clean and safe. The
majority of BIDs, like the one started in San Jose a decade ago,
are financed by a surcharge on business license fees and designed
primarily for marketing and promotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``BIDS have become ubiquitous because they are incredibly
effective in cleaning up cities and reducing anti-social
behavior,'' said Elizabeth Jackson, president of the International
Downtown Association, a Washington, D.C., organization that
publishes a variety of guides from creating a BID to ``Responses to
Panhandling and Homelessness.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  While Los Angeles already has 17 business improvement
districts and 27 more on the drawing board, according to the Los
Angeles Times, San Francisco is still just approaching the launch
pad. That is due in part to political infighting and opposition by
a homeless coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``In San Francisco you put three people in a room and they find
something to protest,'' said Linda Mjellem, executive director of
the Union Square Association. But after three years she anticipates
approval of the Union Square BID soon and major returns.
</P>
<P>
   She notes that one BID in Portland reportedly reduced crime 20
percent. One in Phoenix contributed to a 26 percent gain in sales
tax revenues over three years. One in Denver helped reduce office
vacancy from 31 percent to 13 percent. Another in Houston cut
litter by 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Many BIDs, like the one in Baltimore, have hired their own
radio-equipped but unarmed security personnel. Even without a BID,
several San Francisco businesses and property owners including
Nordstrom, Macy's, Hilton Hotel and the Flood building have hired
10 sweepers and ``ambassadors'' in red jackets to walk their
sidewalks, keeping them clean and safe.
</P>
<P>
   One recent evening, ambassador Danny Rodriguez politely told a
panhandler named Ron that he was sitting too close to Walgreen's
front door on Powell Street (within eight feet). He asked another
homeless person if he wanted a free token for one of the
coin-operated public toilets.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's BID would double or triple Union Square's
current efforts to clean up the city's premier retail area.
</P>
<P>
   Another tactic cities have used to tune up their shopping
districts is to establish minimal standards of public conduct such
as forbidding sleeping in doorways and blocking sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, Seattle was one of the first cities to pass an
ordinance against ``pedestrian interference,'' says Rob Teir,
president of the Center for Liveable Cities in Washington, D.C.
Seattle also was among the first to ban sitting and lying on
sidewalks in commercial districts during business hours.
</P>
<P>
   Teir notes that San Francisco &UR;  &LR; 50-foot ``zone of prohibition''
is one of the most aggressive ordinances against loitering near
automated teller machines. Meanwhile, Los Angeles and Orange
counties were among the first to ban camping in urban parks. And
Beaufort, S.C., and Madison, Wis., passed noise ordinances that
create a ``reasonable person standard'' rather than a single
decibel-level benchmark.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Berkeley's city council banned people from lying,
but not sitting, on sidewalks and passed a rule against more than
two stationary dogs within 10 feet of each other to help disperse
dogs and drifters.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Many people familiar with street crime and other problems
insist that invoking new laws should be the last resort, not the
first. Marc Weinstein, owner of Amoeba Music on both Telegraph
Avenue and Haight Street in San Francisco, acknowledges that
``oppressing people who already are oppressed'' is not politically
palatable in liberal communities like Berkeley. But with
increasingly angry street people, it has become tougher for
merchants to negotiate their way out of problems as they have in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Nona Smith, director of the Lakeshore BID in
Oakland, says it is important to talk with people who may hang
around your store. She also recommends public education campaigns
to discourage giving directly to panhandlers and contributing
instead to homeless shelters and other programs that support them.
</P>
<P>
   Portland's successful BID, which has an annual budget of $3
million, has taken just such an approach with its ``Real Change NOT
Spare Change'' campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Some tactics to regain control of sidewalks may be effective but
not worth the backlash. For example, some merchants in Portland's
Old Town put up drip irrigation pipes on the edge of their roofs
about 15 years ago to discourage vagrants from leaning against
their buildings. The watering worked but was abandoned due to a
flood of negative publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Teir notes that merchants in some Atlantic seaboard communities
such as Charleston and Virginia Beach piped in ``easy-listening
classics'' to break up disruptive youth packs. Other merchants have
recommended Mahler or Barry Manilow. Such music may be ``an
effective crowd-abatement device,'' said one BID official. But it
is risky. ``Your outside speakers may get trashed,'' he warned.
``And you might also drive away potential customers who don't like
the music either.''
</P>
<P>
   One favored way to keep sidewalks clean and safe seems to be
eternal vigilence. ``The best solution is zero tolerance,'' said
Greg Keiser, owner of Graffiti Control Services, which has three
offices in the Bay Area. But that tactic doesn't guarantee cleaned
buildings stay clean. Even after 10 years, the Association for
Portland Progress removes about 4,000 graffiti tags each month over
a 220-block area.

TRIAL REVIEWS MORE MICROSOFT TACTICS
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When employees of Microsoft Corp. discuss the
company's Windows operating system, their language can be
extravagant, even imperial. In documents and depositions presented
in federal court Tuesday, one described Windows as ``our one unique
and valuable asset.'' Another called it ``the crown jewel.''
</P>
<P>
   As the government's antitrust suit against Microsoft entered its
third month Tuesday, the Justice Department continued to
concentrate on evidence that Microsoft used its monopoly position
in operating-system software to have its way in all manner of
competitive challenges.
</P>
<P>
   In court Tuesday, the government offered new charges that
Microsoft had cajoled or threatened companies that for the most
part posed no obvious threat to Microsoft or Windows. The subjects
of those efforts, the government contended, ranged from IBM and MCI
to Walt Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
   The government presented this evidence in the form of videotaped
depositions from Microsoft chairman Bill Gates and executives from
companies who felt they had been bullied.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the government contended, Microsoft felt that Disney
was getting too cozy with Netscape Communications Corp.,
Microsoft's chief rival in Internet software. Disney vice president
Steve Wadsworth said Microsoft threatened to pull Disney's logo _
an easy link to the company's Web site _ from its Windows channel
bar.
</P>
<P>
   Disney was ``being roughed up by the 1,000-pound guerilla of the
industry,'' Wadsworth testified in a taped deposition. ``These guys
have all the cards. I felt like we were being, you know,
leveraged.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Disney reduced the level of its involvement with
Netscape, afraid to lose its position on the Windows desktop.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding IBM, the government showed that in March 1994, a
Microsoft executive, Joachim Kempin, addressed Gates' apparent
concern over IBM's growing relationship with Lotus _ a Microsoft
competitor in business software _ by stating in an e-mail that the
company needed a ``hit team to attack IBM as a large account,
whereby the OEM relationship should be used to apply some
pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   By that, Kempin apparently meant that Microsoft should take
advantage of IBM's need, as an original-equipment manufacturer, to
install Windows on the personal computers it sold. Eventually, IBM
bought Lotus.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in a videotaped deposition played in court Tuesday about
Kempin's e-mail, Gates said that ``hit team'' was a not-uncommon
term for Microsoft salesmen.
</P>
<P>
   Gates was also asked about an e-mail he received from another
Microsoft executive, Russell Siegelman, in 1994. In that message,
Siegelman said he opposed a request by MCI to have a link to its
Internet server on the Windows desktop, referring to ``the Windows
box'' as ``our one unique and valuable asset.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about that, Gates seemed perplexed and said, ``The Windows
box is a piece of cardboard.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft complained about the playing of videotapes Tuesday,
particularly further use of the tape of Gates' deposition, several
parts of which had already been shown. At one point, the government
played a brief clip in which David Boies, the government's lead
trial lawyer, entered the deposition room as the camera focused on
Gates, who was scowling down at the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good morning, Mr. Gates,'' Boies said. Gates did not look up
or answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the legal significance of whether Bill Gates says
`Good morning' to his inquisitors?'' Microsoft asked in a news
release, one of two documents the company handed out Tuesday to
reporters offering 24 pages of counterarguments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government's reliance on edited videotaped depositions
underscores the weaknesses in the government's case by taking out
of context assertions from Microsoft's competitors and amplifying''
them, the company asserted.
</P>
<P>
   But Boies told the judge that 80 percent of the final tape
played Tuesday was shown at Microsoft's request.
</P>
<P>
   That deposition was of Brian Croll, a Sun Microsystems executive
asked by a Microsoft lawyer about Sun's inclusion of its Hot Java
Web browser with Solaris, Sun's operating system for server
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Microsoft, Croll testified, Sun let users remove its
browser from Solaris and install another.
</P>
<P>
   Gates, asked in his deposition to name Microsoft's rivals for PC
operating systems, listed IBM, Sun and five smaller companies.
</P>
<P>
   But IBM executives testified earlier that the company could not
compete with Microsoft and had stopped marketing its OS/2 operating
system to consumers. Croll of Sun testified that the PC operating
system business ``is closed to us'' because of Microsoft's
monopoly.

QUESTION OF RACE ENTERS NBA LABOR DYNAMIC  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS and MIKE WISE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The negotiations have often been heated during the five-month
standoff between the National Basketball Association's owners and
players. As contract talks have stretched on, forcing the
cancellation of much of the season, there have been screaming
matches, traded insults, lots of posturing and more than a couple
of threats, veiled and otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   In many respects, then, the negotiations have been like any
high-stakes labor dispute, and indeed baseball's long history of
strikes and lockouts has included much the same kind of acrimony.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent weeks, as the specter of a lost season has loomed
larger, both sides in the negotiations _ the 100 percent white
ownership, and the players union that is 85 percent black _ have
come to conclude that the effort to break the impasse and start the
season may have become complicated by a sensitive and combustible
component: the question of race.
</P>
<P>
   Players, including several on the union's negotiating committee,
have found the league's bargaining style to be disrespectful and
provocative, and they suspect that it has been driven at least in
part by a belief that a predominantly black union somehow did not
have to be taken fully seriously.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, members of ownership's negotiating team, as
well as several agents, have acknowledged that the perception that
the negotiations have been racially tinged has served to solidify
the players ranks, and perhaps made them willing to sacrifice the
entire season to make a stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe there are respect issues and maybe there is some
race involved,'' said Dikembe Mutombo, a center for the Atlanta
Hawks and a member of the union's negotiating committee. ``Some
guys are feeling that. The owners think the players want to steal
the power. That's not it at all. We want a fair deal. It's about
money, but it's also about power and respect.''
</P>
<P>
   The players, who admit that they can not point to a single,
overtly racist comment or tactic on the part of the owners or the
league, say they have nonetheless been offended by many aspects of
ownership's stance. They have been offended by what they regard as
ownership's dismissive responses to their contract proposals. And
they believe the owners and league officials like Commissioner
David Stern have all too willingly allowed the players to be
publicly portrayed as greedy materialists interested only in their
multiple car payments, people too unintelligent to appreciate the
financial stakes involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what the owners and Stern think?'' asked Karl Malone,
the veteran forward for the Utah Jazz. ``They tell themselves, `We
know how players live. So you know what, we're going to see? We'll
see if they've got guts or not.' They want to make us suffer.
They're saying to themselves, `These players got all these cars. We
can tell the public so and so can't make the payment on his
Mercedes Benz or his third house.' But that's so childish. They're
trying to show us, like you would your little son or daughter, that
daddy is going to punish you.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA's owners and league officials are adamant that race has
not influenced their position or their treatment of the players and
their union. But privately, members of ownership's negotiating team
believe that the union may be using a sense of racial identity and
pride among the players to sustain their unity and preserve their
bargaining position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe different people might view it through a different
prism, but not the league, not the owners and not me,'' Stern said
of the possibility that the players felt a racial edge to the
contentious negotiations. Stern insisted that the negotiations were
exclusively about ``trying to get 29 teams to function well
economically so the league and the players can survive and
prosper.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The NBA has spent a lot of time proving to the world it's not
about race,'' he said of the league's spectacular marketing success
over the last two decades. ``This is a place, where perhaps better
than any other industry in the world, you do well if you are
talented.''
</P>
<P>
   Without a single major breakthrough in negotiations, the lockout
has plodded into its sixth month. Frustrated by the lack of
progress, both sides are staring at a dubious first in American
sports history: the loss of an entire season to labor strife.
</P>
<P>
   So far, players have lost more than $300 million in salaries and
could lose $1.1 billion if the season is scrapped. Although the
owners have a financial cushion via a television contract with NBC
and Turner Sports, the losses resulting from a cancelled season
could be enormous. Both sides have indicated that if a deal is not
struck in the next several weeks the season likely will be
scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Hunter, the black executive director of the players union,
said he did not currently believe that the question of race has
affected the negotiations, but he conceded that it was probably
impossible for the topic of race not to come up in the course of
difficult talks involving whites and blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you incorporate into the equation that we have a league of
athletes who are 85 percent African-American and a group of owners
who are white, then consequently you get a picture of the
bargaining table with the sophisticated, old boys club on one side
and the young athletes, who by nature are apolitical, on the other
side.'' Hunter concluded: ``People will see what they want to
see.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the negotiations, players have felt slighted by a
league they helped to build. The NBA recovered from its
drug-tainted image of the '70s with a savvy marketing strategy that
created pop culture superstars out of its players. Now, some
players, although they are making exorbitant salaries, sense a tone
in the negotiations that leave them feeling like parts on a
conveyor belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're smearing the players, and in the process, they're
degrading their own product,'' Malone said. ``You can't degrade
your own product. Show me your marketing tool to get all the fans
back when this is over with: It's the players, and it's always been
the players. The league has cast us as dumb and stupid and
uninformed, but they'll be waiting for us to get out there and
pitch computers for IBM. In the end, you've degraded me, called me
unintelligent, but you're going to want to sell me to the public
after this. You're going to want to make money off of me. You don't
treat people that way.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some prominent players have felt as if their intelligence and
resolve been arrogantly challenged by the owners and league
officials. They cite, by way of example, the fact that, after the
players made their initial contract proposal last August, the
owners abruptly broke off talks and walked out of negotiations.
They have, too, interpreted Stern's repeated comments about whether
they fully understand the amount of money they are losing as
condescending.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, members of ownership's bargaining team think the
players have embraced a racial component as a way to help stand
firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't deny the possibility that the union has the ability
to use race as a rallying point,'' said one member of ownership's
negotiating team, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``There
may be code words used to rally its members, code words that have
racial connotations.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Woods, a white agent who represents two black players,
said he was convinced Hunter has subtly used the issue of race to
maintain unity as the weeks have worn on and the financial toll for
the players has escalated. In October, Hunter circulated among the
players copies of a newspaper article that depicted the players as
unprincipled athletes who would crumble in the face of economic
hardship.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the oldest motivational ploys in sports to get them
fired up is to tell a player, `You're not dumb, are you?' Well,
Billy Hunter has essentially said to his players, `David Stern and
the owners think you're dumb. You're not dumb, are you?''' said
Woods. ``Instead of debating business issues, Billy Hunter has
constantly reinforced the emotional issues, which is at the heart
of the unity.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, players, perhaps in an effort to put pressure
on the owners, have begun to speak more openly about the degree to
which questions of race have begun to be infused into the
negotiations and the environment surrounding them.
</P>
<P>
   Jayson Williams of the Nets said that ``for some guys it's hard
not to think about race.'' Williams said that if the season is
cancelled, ``you'll have to look under the carpet and ask why.'' In
an interview with Newsweek magazine, Alonzo Mourning, the Miami
Heat center and member of the union's negotiating committee, said:
``I think there is a perception from the owners to even some fans
that we're blacks who should be happy with what we got, fair or
not. There's a lack of respect given us in large part because we're
athletes. I'm not saying it's all about race, because it's not. But
it plays a factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Buck Williams, the former president of the players union, said
race playing a role was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sense among some of the players that race is a
subtext in all of this,'' former union president Buck Williams
said. ``I say that because there are some in the American public
who have difficulty with African Americans _ some of whom don't
have college degrees _ commanding the salaries that they do in the
league. I think some players may look upon that perception when
dealing with the owners. In the end, it's sheer business. But I
think, just like in society, race is a subtext. I don't think the
N.B.A. is excluded from that.''
</P>
<P>
   The suspicions of the players have been fueled by even the more
minor of details in negotiations. For instance, some players have
questioned why it has almost always been left to Hunter to make the
telephone call necessary to restart talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why doesn't David call Billy?'' Mutombo asked. ``Always Billy
has to make the call. I think it's just respect. I think when
you're the boss and you've got the money, you want control. You
have to be in charge.''
</P>

   If there is a chasm beyond economics that is special to the NBA,
some observers prefer to look at it as more of a generational gap
than a racial divide. The NBA has been predominantly black for the
last three decades, with its union anchored by black leadership.
But even former players such as Isiah Thomas and Oscar Robertson
have questioned the current union's caustic behavior during
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure about the perspective of black vs. white, but I
don't think you have the same kind of intellectual thought process
going on among these union leaders that the NBA once had,'' said
Phil Jackson, the former Chicago Bulls coach and NBA player. `We've
got a group of players that haven't even finished college standing
up there at the podium. I'm not saying college is essential for
understanding these issues, but when Isiah Thomas, Paul Silas, John
Havlicek, Oscar Robertson and people like Bill Bradley were
involved in the union, they looked beyond their own generation to
what was good for the game.''

 UNDATED: cruise missiles. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The timing of any strikes could be complicated by Ramadan, the
Islamic holy month, which begins this weekend. Officials have in
the past speculated that the United States would be unlikely to
have a confrontation with Iraq during the holiday, for fearing of
stoking anti-American sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   The United States would also be unlikely to launch a strike
until the United Nations has had time to remove the remaining arms
inspectors from Iraq. That could take a day or so, leaving a
rapidly narrowing window of opportunity this week if Clinton
decides on an immediate response.
</P>
<P>
   Coming in the midst of Washington's roiling debate over
impeachment, the latest confrontation will inevitably raise
accusations that Clinton may use Saddam as a diversion.
</P>
<P>
   On NBC's ``Meet the Press'' on Sunday, Rep. Tom DeLay, the
majority whip leading the House's impeachment effort, responded
bluntly when asked about the prospect of a strike on Iraq, accusing
the president of manipulating foreign policy to divert attention
from his personal and political crises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, about the time he was supposed to give the
deposition in January, he sent the troops and rattled his sabers at
Saddam Hussein?'' DeLay said. ``Nothing happened. Remember in
November _ I mean in June, he went to China after moving that trip
from November to June, when he thought he was going to be in trial
with Paula Jones? And then again in August, he starts rattling his
saber again and backs off. That's what's happening.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in August, Clinton did order cruise missile strikes
against paramilitary camps in Afghanistan and a pharmaceutical
factory in the Sudan _ on the day Monica Lewinsky appeared for a
second time before the federal grand jury investigating Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Clinton angrily dismiss the notion, pointing out that
the periodic confrontations with Iraq have been driven by Saddam's
defiance.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ It was a classic Bill Clinton rhetorical parallel,
and to American ears perhaps an apt, even poetic, one.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech on Monday in Gaza City to a meeting of Palestinian
leaders, Clinton compared the children of Israelis slain by
Palestinians to the children of Palestinian prisoners in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to find a way for both sets of children to get their
lives back and to go forward,'' he said, in an exhortation that
like much of his speech was improvised, his aides say.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had met them in reverse order I would not have known
which ones were Israeli and which Palestinian,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   But the parallel _ a result of Clinton's reaction to two
meetings with children, here and in Gaza City _ resounded like a
thunderclap in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon strongly protested what they thought smacked
of moral equivalence between murderers and their victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very difficult comparison that caused deep shock in
Israel,'' Sharon told reporters after a meeting Tuesday morning of
Clinton, Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu said, ``Some of those murderers murdered children.''
</P>
<P>
   Protesters rallied outside Clinton's hotel here Tuesday, the
last day of his three-day trip intended to restart the peace
effort. Israeli radio filled with chatter about Clinton's remark,
with many commentators finding naivete in his symmetry.
</P>
<P>
   The commentary reflected the widely held Israeli view that
outsiders simply do not understand what it was like to live in a
country burdened by the daily threat of suicide bombings and other
attacks aimed at civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's ``equation of children whose parents are in Israeli
prisons and children who lost their parents in acts of terror is
unjust,'' one commentator, Nahum Barnea, whose son died in a bus
bombing three years ago, wrote in Tuesday's issue of the daily
Yediot Ahronot. ``Clinton is too intelligent not to know that not
all tears are equal.''
</P>
<P>
   The uproar, which sounded a sour note for a trip that Clinton on
Tuesday called successful, showed how his careful sensitivity to
others' pain and his facility with words can occasionally land him
in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have repeatedly praised the president for
understanding their fears while doggedly driving the parties
forward. But this time, as he tried to thread the needle of Middle
Eastern sensitivities on the highly charged issue of Palestinian
prisoners, he may have slipped.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement negotiated in October at the Wye River
Plantation, the Israelis agreed to release some Palestinian
prisoners. But Netanyahu says, and the Americans agree, that he
never said he would release prisoners who have blood on their
hands.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, disappointment over the Israeli releases of car
thieves and other criminals rather than the men Palestinians regard
as heroes has led to violence by Palestinian protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's advisers said a powerful, emotional appeal by the
president was being misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Berger, the national security adviser, said Sharon raised
the comment with Clinton Tuesday morning ``in a very friendly
way.'' The president, Berger said, noted that he had denounced
terrorism in his speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point he was making is that continued conflict between the
parties produces pain and hardship in which many of the victims are
children,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the president was
trying to point out that ``there were tears by both groups of
children,'' but that ``in no way did he draw any parallel about the
cause of the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same speech on Monday evening, Clinton said, ``No matter
how sharp a grievance or how deep a hurt, there is not
justification for killing innocents.''
</P>
<P>
   From long days negotiating with the American president,
Clinton's hosts have clearly learned what moves him. At an official
dinner here on Sunday night, Netanyahu introduced the president to
the family of Assam Assam, an Israeli being held by Egypt, which
accuses him of being a spy. He also introduced him to children
whose parents had been killed by Palestinians, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at a banquet in Gaza City on Tuesday, Arafat surprised the
president and his aides with an unscheduled meeting: He introduced
him to some young girls whose fathers, he said, were prisoners in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need my father to come home,'' wept one girl, according to
an interpretation for the president by a Palestinian official with
one arm over her shoulders. ``You have a daughter and you know the
feeling.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   She said she had not seen her father in 10 years, and as she
cried into a handkerchief, Clinton clasped her right hand in both
of his and stared down at her.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we have peace without the release of all our
prisoners?'' she asked. ``How can you expect me as a girl to live
without my father?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton thanked the girl for coming to see him. ``Your father
would be very proud of you,'' he said as Arafat stood nearby with
his arms around two other sobbing girls. ``You did a wonderful job
today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported that two of the Palestinian girls
who met with the president had fathers who were serving life
sentences, one for killing an Israeli and one for killing a
Palestinian collaborator.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was not on Clinton's schedule, and some of his aides
said the president had been ambushed. American reporters were not
admitted, but the exchange was covered by Palestinian television.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Clinton addressed the Palestinian leaders after they held
a show of hands ratifying the removal from their charter of clauses
that called for the destruction of Israel. He described the two
groups of children he had met. ``Those children brought tears to my
eyes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must acknowledge that neither side has a monopoly on pain
or virtue,'' he said. The audience applauded.

RED CROSS CRITICIZED FOR SITTING ON FLOOD RELIEF DONATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn., N.D.)  (rl) 
 By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The Minnesota attorney general has accused the
American Red Cross of mishandling disaster relief assistance in the
floods that ravaged the Red River Valley in Minnesota and North
Dakota in the spring of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In a report issued Tuesday, Attorney General Hubert Humphrey III
criticized the Red Cross for not disbursing all of the donations it
collected for flood victims, even though, the report said, there
continue to be people who need help recovering from flood damage _
everything from corroded basements and foundations to medical
problems caused by flood-induced mold and mildew.
</P>
<P>
   ``This report shows how the Red Cross, by withholding millions
of dollars in donations, has failed in its responsibility to
donors, to survivors and to the public at large,'' Humphrey said in
a statement. ``When people gave the Red Cross their hard-earned
money, they expected it would promptly get to those whose lives
were devastated by the floods _ not sit in a bank account for a
year and a half.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Blaul, a spokesman for the Red Cross in Washington, said
the agency did nothing wrong in the way it handled the relief
effort and distributed the donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our response in this disaster has been quick and compassionate
and professional across the board,'' Blaul said. He said the
attorney general's office betrayed ``just a basic lack of
understanding of how the American Red Cross provides disaster
relief.''
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the report is the $16 million in donations that
the Red Cross collected specifically for victims of the Red River
Valley floods in April 1997, which prompted the country's largest
flood-related evacuation and damaged much of Grand Forks, N.D.
</P>
<P>
   After months of inquiries from the attorney general's office,
the report said, the Red Cross acknowledged in June 1998 that it
still held $4.3 million of that money. The report said that after
the attorney general's office pressed the agency and said there
were still people who needed help, the Red Cross announced a plan
to distribute the remaining money.
</P>
<P>
   But Humphrey's office said the Red Cross was slow to carry out
the plan and that about three months later, in late August and
early September, he held public hearings so that flood victims and
local flood relief agencies could make their demands to the Red
Cross directly. At those hearings, Red Cross officials said they
had so far made specific commitments to give victims about $100,000
of the $4.3 million, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Blaul said the Red Cross had been following a timetable proven
to work in disasters and would have announced its distribution plan
in June without the pressure from the attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   Between the June announcement and today, Blaul said, the Red
Cross has distributed $750,000 of the $4.3 million to 435 flood
victims. It has rejected the claims of 370 other people and is
considering the requests of 305 additional cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saying the American Red Cross has withdrawn before the job was
completed _ that is completely untrue,'' Blaul said.
</P>
<P>
   Humphrey's report does not criticize the Red Cross response in
the immediate aftermath of the Red River Valley floods, when
thousands of people were given emergency shelter and assistance.
</P>
<P>
   At the public hearings, people complained about long-range
problems _ damaged basements, loss of income from jobs and mounting
debt to creditors for home repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Roberta Cordano, an assistant attorney general, said Tuesday
that the Red Cross did not effectively publicize that it was still
taking applications and that the application process for people
suffering long-term flood damage was more burdensome than the
process followed by other relief agencies, in part because the Red
Cross often requires victims to exhaust opportunities for federal
and state assistance before it will grant aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we've got elderly people coming out of the woodwork who a
year ago thought they could handle this on their own,'' Ms. Cordano
said. ``Now they've got homes rotting with mold and mildew and they
can't qualify for Red Cross assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also said the Red Cross, asserting that its charter
made it answerable only to Congress and the federal government,
refused to give the attorney general's staff much of the
information they sought. Humphrey wants Congress to make the Red
Cross accountable to state governments, as other charities are.

IN PLACE OF PEOPLE BURIED ALIVE, WOODEN EFFIGIES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 20) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RITA REIF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ In the fifth century B.C., Confucius questioned the
practice of burying people alive alongside the dead in funerary
rituals, calling it a waste of human life. But it was not until 100
years later that the Chu people of Southern China abandoned human
sacrifice, replacing the living in such rituals with carved and
lacquered wooden figures.
</P>
<P>
   Chu artists produced haunting effigies of concubines, slaves,
deer and tigers, all common in the retinues of Chinese rulers
during the late Warring States period (fourth century to third
century B.C.) and the Han Dynasty (206 B.C. to 220 A.D.).
</P>
<P>
   They created images as stark and simple as the Cycladic figures
of ancient Greece and the modernist sculpture of Brancusi and
Nadelman. They lacquered the surfaces in brilliant colors or, in
some cases, dressed the human figures in silk robes.
</P>
<P>
   The pieces ranged in height from one foot to four feet and
predated by a century the spectacular life-size terra cotta
warriors that were excavated in 1974 at Xian. An army of these
figures was removed from the tomb of China's first emperor, Qin Shi
Huang, and has since been exhibited in museums throughout the
world.
</P>
<P>
   But the Chu figures _ as well as horses and mythological
creatures produced at the time elsewhere in China _ are less well
known than the terra cotta pieces, even though museums and
galleries have exhibited examples for a half-century.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, the Metropolitan Museum of Art was given three such
figures _ two standing attendants and a kneeling one _ by Mathias
Komor a New York dealer in ancient art. Two years later, the
British Museum acquired an animal figure with a long tongue and
antlers that served as a guardian.
</P>
<P>
   A large number of Chu works have been excavated over the past 20
years, and recently such works have become more visible in the
market. The most prominent dealer in this material in the West is
Jacques Barrere, who has sold about 60 of the figures at his Left
Bank gallery.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Barrere exhibited five Chu figures at the first Asian
Art Fair in New York, where he sold a two-foot-tall Han guardian
figure of a deer to a collector of modern art for about $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   Five months later, he brought 17 figures to the Biennale
Internationale des Antiquaires in Paris. He sold them to collectors
from many parts of the world as well as to Noriyoshi Horiuchi, a
Tokyo dealer in ancient art. Horiuchi, an adviser to the Miho
Museum near Kyoto, said recently that he was planning an exhibition
of Chu works in Asia. This fall, Barrere exhibited 18 other figures
at his gallery; most of them were bought.
</P>
<P>
   Now because of the soaring prices for Asian art and the
increased cost of conserving them, Barrere would not give the
prices he asks for those he stocks. These include figures of
guardians, attendants, dancers, prancing horses, a unicorn and a
deer with spectacular antlers, which are centuries older than the
carving itself.
</P>
<P>
   The Chu figures are now both the subject of scholarly study and
are being actively collected by museums. Last year, the Brooklyn
Museum acquired an androgynous figure, and the Guimet Museum here
added a phoenix, a deer and two attendants to its holdings.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego Museum of Art will present ``Ringing Thunder: Chu
Treasures from Ancient China,'' an exhibition of ritual bronzes,
jades, gold, glass and lacquer wares, from June 12 to Aug. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1990, when Barrere and his wife, Marie, first saw the
figures in Asia, they were stunned by both their simplicity and
rarity. But their beauty was diminished by water damage; most had
been found in tombs that had been flooded.
</P>
<P>
   Barrere said the figures represented the greatest risk he had
ever taken since he had become an art dealer in 1966 because there
was no guarantee they could be restored.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Barrere said the pieces looked ``shrunken, like bad
Giacomettis.'' Rescuing them, she said, proved to be a daunting
challenge: ``We had one disaster with a wet piece. We removed it
from the plastic film in which it was kept in a box filled with
water. Within a day it began to split and seven days later it had
crumbled into bits and pieces of shrunken wood.''
</P>
<P>
   The Barreres investigated several art conservation laboratories
and finally selected the new commercial division of the Nucleart
Regional Conservation Studio in Grenoble, France, formerly a
government research laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   To restore the figures, they are dried and injected with
polyethylene glycol, a polymer plastic. In a process that takes
eight months to two years, the vivid lacquer colors are muted and
the loose silk garments on some figures wrinkle and skrink, looking
like a skin of crushed taffeta.
</P>
<P>
   ``The figures had to be saved,'' Barrere said. ``They were going
to be lost forever, and we couldn't let that happen without making
an effort. Never mind who owns them now. They belong to something
eternal.''

`SPRINGER': GLIDING FROM MAYOR TO RINGMASTER

<P>
   I cannot promise that a biography of Jerry Springer is worth an
hour of anyone's time, but there is within ``Jerry Springer: In the
Center Ring'' the lesson that the talents that bring success in
politics may smoothly be turned to making a television superstar.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's hourlong edition of ``Biography'' on A&AMP;E goes
over the high and low spots of the activities of this son of
Holocaust survivors: anti-Vietnam War and civil rights causes in
the 1960s; local political office in Cincinnati, leading to a term
as mayor; an apparent taste for prostitutes that brought career and
marriage difficulties (lesson is, don't pay by check); and
ascendence as a talk-cum-commotion-show prodigy, with 25 million
fans around the world.
</P>
<P>
   There may seem to be a dissonance between the ideals of the
onetime Stevenson Democrat (``Jerry was driven by the right
things,'' says a colleague) and the man who presides over ``My
Wife's Sleeping With My Aunt,'' but when has that ever stopped a
smash hit?
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning, when the physical encounters for which his
program became famous may have been more or less impromptu, our
host can be seen saying, ``I don't want to be part of anything that
brings violence into the home.'' But once the revelation dawned
that it was the violence that drew audiences, he evidently
rethought his position. In show business as in politics,
flexibility makes life easier.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Springer is not one of the talk show hosts who
make grand claims for the edifying qualities of their offerings. He
grants that they are silly and advises critics, ``If you don't like
the show, don't watch it.'' And on screen, he manages to keep his
distance from the less restrained participants without discouraging
them from acting out.
</P>
<P>
   But how does his current give-the-folks-what-they-want principle
accord with the principles that moved him to do battle for minority
rights? Well, it doesn't. What Springer evidently learned is that
talent has diverse uses: The amiably audacious style that worked
for the local campaigner has worked in a big way for the television
performer. The values involved are incidental or irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   One may lament that high-mindedness has little to do with
success on television, but that seems a touch pointless at this
stage. More disheartening than the fact that Jerry Springer has
become a multimillionaire by giving his abilities to what he agrees
is silly stuff or worse is the news that his program is aimed at
college students. Yes, viewers, the fans who whoop up shows like
``Confronting One-Night Stands!'' are America's brightest and best.

BUSINESS TRAVEL: CLOCK TICKING ON FREQUENT-FLIER MILES

   Certain miles accumulated in United Airlines and American
Airlines frequent-flier programs are scheduled to expire Dec. 31,
but there is still time to use or preserve them, while miles
originally scheduled to expire in Delta Air Lines' and Northwest
Airlines' programs have been extended a year. As always, miles in
the Continental Airlines and U S Airways programs do not expire at
all.
</P>
<P>
   The miles that will soon expire in the United and American
programs are those that were earned in 1995. But members of either
program who lack enough miles for a free flight may be able to
qualify by transferring miles from their Diners Club Club Rewards
or American Express Membership Rewards programs.
</P>
<P>
   Or they can use their accumulated miles for a rental car or free
hotel stays or upgrades. Or they can donate their miles to a
charity sponsored by the airline. Trans World Airlines' frequent
fliers, for example, have donated more than 5 million miles to the
Salvation Army, which sent 75 volunteers on TWA flights to the
Caribbean to repair homes that were destroyed by Hurricane Georges,
and to provide food to hundreds of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Members with enough miles for a flight but not enough time can
redeem them for a specific flight in 1999 or for an award
certificate. Since a certificate is good for a year from date of
issue, it can be redeemed anytime next year for reservations on a
flight as much as a year in advance.
</P>
<P>
   TWA's miles expire after three years, unless a member makes at
least one round- trip flight every three years. Three-year-old
miles in Delta's frequent-flier program were scheduled to expire at
the end of this year, unless the member made at least one new
flight in the last three years, but the airline extended the
deadline until the end of 1999. Because of the recent pilots'
strike against Northwest Airlines, that carrier is also giving a
year's grace for miles that were scheduled to expire at the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Airlines, which often marches to a different drummer,
does so with its frequent-flier program: A free ticket on Southwest
requires 8 round trips or 16 one-way flights within a 12-month
period, and the ticket (which is transferable) is valid for one
year from the date of issue. &QL;

<P>
   Out of Commission
</P>
<P>
   After striking a reef Monday while leaving St. Maarten in the
French West Indies, Royal Caribbean's Monarch of the Seas has
canceled its scheduled voyage this Sunday and may cancel others,
pending assessment of the damage. Meanwhile, all 2,557 passengers
aboard were safely evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Caribbean said Tuesday that those passengers, as well as
those who were booked on next Sunday's cruise, would receive a full
refund plus a free cruise within a year on a similar itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise Ship Delays
</P>
<P>
   Disney Cruise Line's second ship, the Disney Wonder, will be
delivered next spring, but its maiden voyage is not scheduled until
Aug. 15. Because of the construction delay, not only will the ship
miss most of the traditional summer cruise season, but it has had
to cancel 44 sailings that were scheduled beginning next March. The
first Disney ship, the Disney Magic, had to cancel 40 cruises this
year when construction delays forced it to push back its inaugural
voyage twice _ from March to April, then to July 30.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the size and number of new ships being built, delays
and cancellations are becoming more common, if not yet routine.
Carnival's Holland America had to cancel several sailings of its
Rotterdam VI last fall when the ship was delivered six weeks late,
while the 2,600-passenger Grand Princess, owned by the Peninsular
and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, had to delay its maiden
voyage 12 days this May.
</P>
<P>
   No Smoking. Seriously.
</P>
<P>
   A recent passenger aboard the Carnival Paradise, the industry's
first smoke-free cruise ship, was put off in Nassau, where he had
to pay his own way home. `'All passengers have been warned that
it's a ship for nonsmokers,'' said Jennifer De la Cruz, a Carnival
spokeswoman, ``and we're serious about keeping it that way.''

LOS ANGELES TIMES TO LAY OFF 500, RESTRUCTURE   OPERATIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Admitting it is trailing other newspapers in eight
of 11 Southern California markets, the Los Angeles Times said on
Tuesday it will fire 500 employees and reorganize its local
operations into four regions.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper, a unit of L.A.-based Times Mirror Co., has
slashed 750 jobs, or about 12percent of its work force, since early
November in response to shrinking profits and disappointing ad
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The Times said yet another round of cost reductions will be
announced before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Times is currently the number two paper ... here, a
situation that we must reverse. To become the number one paper, we
need a nimble, decentralized organization in each of our diverse
regions that can compete more effectively,'' said Kathryn M.
Downing, the paper's president and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's cuts, announced 10 days before Christmas and during
Hanukkah, are concentrated in the paper's business units, including
380 telemarketing jobs eliminated in its circulation department.
Other firings were in the Times' finance, human resources and
administrative services divisions.
</P>
<P>
   The total of 500 cuts will cover 130 full-time and 370 part-time
positions. They amount to about 8 percent of the paper's payroll.
</P>
<P>
   No positions were eliminated in the news department during this
round of cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unfortunate time because we are disrupting people
during the holidays and we are disrupting families during the
holidays and I would prefer it not be at this time,'' Downing said.
</P>
<P>
   The paper's new strategy calls for creating two new regions for
business purposes: Los Angeles and the Inland Empire/San Gabriel
Valley region. The Times has Orange County and San Fernando
Valley/Ventura County regions.
</P>
<P>
   Downing said the paper's regular metro edition will continue to
be included in the new regions' editions while management decides
whether to offer readers a regionalized news product similar to
those produced for the Valley and Ventura, and Orange counties.
</P>
<P>
   Full-time employees being fired will receive 18 weeks to two
years of pay, depending on their length of service, while part-time
workers will get from 12 to 18 weeks of pay.
</P>
<P>
   Times Mirror will take a charge of up to $225 million this year
to pay for the restructuring. Its stock closed Tuesday at $55.25,
up 6.25 cents. The cuts were announced after the market closed.
</P>
<P>
   The firings come a week after the company announced it was
giving $1 million to Columbia University's Graduate School of
Journalism to fund a visiting professorship to study diversity in
media issues.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper spokesman Mike Lang said the paper also is planning to
introduce up to 12 ``Our Times'' community news editions next year
throughout Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper industry analyst John Morton said large newspapers
like the Times ``are trying to both broaden and deepen their
franchise and one way to do that is create regional or zoned
editions and attempt to be more than just the big metro paper.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Times Mirror has shed assets to focus on its
newspapers, which include the Baltimore Sun and Newsday on Long
Island, N.Y. But high costs and a soft advertising market,
particularly for classified ads, have led to reduced expectations
for the company and a 10 percent decline in the company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Downing said it is ``critical'' to cut costs wherever possible
to improve the bottom line.

STANFORD'S COLLINS AGAIN BITTEN BY BAD LUCK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Stanford freshman Jason Collins is big, fast,
skilled, intelligent and insightful. But apparently, he was born
without luck.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, a reserve center, had wrist surgery Tuesday and will
miss the remainder of the season. It's the latest setback for the
North Hollywood resident and Harvard-Westlake High graduate, who
played in one game last year because of a knee injury that required
two surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was faced with no alternative,'' Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery said Tuesday. ``Each doctor he talked to recommended
(surgery), so he resigned himself to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much to say. There's not much positive you can
make out of it, because he was playing well and helping the team
and anxious to get back on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins averaged four points and three rebounds in 13 minutes
per game for the No. 7 Cardinal (5-2). He outplayed starting center
Tim Young in several games and was improving by the week, slowly
regaining the timing and confidence that made him one of the
nation's top recruits in 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
   But on Dec. 6, he fell against George Washington and dislocated
his right wrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times guys fall and sprain their wrists, but this was
a different situation,'' Montgomery said. ``Of the small bones in
the wrist, all of them moved. A lot of stuff had to be tied back
together. There wasn't much choice. The alternative was a cast for
two months and another (month) to rehab.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins redshirted last season after tearing meniscus cartilage
in November. He could request a sixth year of eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're investigating,'' Montgomery said. ``But that's not
something that happens every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins will have company on the bench, at least for the moment.
Reserve shooting guard Ryan Mendez will miss several weeks with a
stress reaction in his knee, and reserve point guard Mike McDonald
is out 5-7 weeks with a foot injury.
</P>
<P>
   Coaching dominoes: When Phil Jackson parted company with the
Chicago Bulls in June, it created a ripple effect through the
college coaching ranks that ended with a construction company in
Northern California. The tide of events:
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was replaced by Iowa State's Tim Floyd on July 23.
</P>
<P>
   Five days later, Iowa State hired Utah State's Larry Eustachy.
</P>
<P>
   Utah State hired Colorado State's Stew Morrill on Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado State hired Portland State's Ritchie McKay on Aug. 21.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, Portland State promoted assistant Joel Sobotka to
replace McKay.
</P>
<P>
   Sobotka then hired Santa Clara assistant Sam Sciulli.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Santa Clara replaced Sciulla with Jason Sedlock, a
former player who had been working construction while trying to
break into the coaching business.
</P>
<P>
   Seniors to watch: Keep an eye on Pittsburgh's Vonteego Cummings
and Boise State's Roberto Bergersen during the season and,
especially, as the NBA Draft approaches. Unknown to most of the
nation, they're well-regarded by NBA scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Cummings, a 6-4 guard, was the best athlete in the Puerto Rico
Shootout and proved to one Western Conference scout he could run an
offense despite his scoring instincts. A second-team All-Big East
pick last year, Cummings is averaging 17 points with 49 assists and
31 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Bergersen, a 6-6 wing man, is a Seattle native who played one
year at Washington before transferring to Boise State. He's a
better prospect than Washington's Donald Watts, one scout said, and
scored 60 points in two games in the Indiana Classic last week.
He's averaging 23.9 points, fifth in the country, and shooting 54.8
percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Around the nation: The conclusion of the fall semester signals
eligibility for three impact players. Georgia Tech center Jason
Collier scored 22 points Sunday in his first game since
transferring from Indiana. Arizona State forward Mike Batiste will
play Saturday after missing eight games because of academics. New
Mexico forward Kenny Thomas also returns Saturday; he was suspended
for the semester because of an NCAA eligibility issue dating to his
freshman season...
</P>
<P>
   Think Michigan officials are regretting the promotion of Brian
Ellerbe from interim to permanent coach last spring? He's 0-4
against Mid-American Conference competition in just over a year.
This season, the Wolverines have lost to Western Michigan, Florida
International and Ball State. Duke beat them by a school-record 44
points Saturday...
</P>
<P>
   After an unimpressive first month, Kentucky's Scott Padgett
played like an All-American with 25 points and 13 rebounds in the
Wildcats' victory over Maryland...
</P>
<P>
   Jim Harrick has Rhode Island rounding into form just in time for
his visit to Pepperdine on Dec. 29. URI improved to 5-4 with a
victory Saturday at Ohio. ``We had Kentucky in here last year,''
Ohio coach Larry Hunter said. ``I think this team today was as good
as any we've had here in a few years.''...
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's victory over San Francisco in the Puerto Rico Shootout
may carry more weight in the power rankings than first thought. The
Dons are 7-3 _ their best start since reviving basketball in 1985 _
and are playing so well San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown attended a
recent game...
</P>
<P>
   Portland State wing man Jason Hartman, a Thousand Oaks native
who played one season at Washington, scored 34 points in a 73-62
loss to Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Around the Pacific-10: The most disappointing team so far is
Washington, which lost at Boise State and Gonzaga last week. The
Huskies are simply overscheduled. They played three games in three
days in Hawaii, then flew straight to Chicago for a Great-Eight
loss to Connecticut. They were home for two days before heading to
Boise and Spokane...
</P>
<P>
   That was no misprint: Oregon State lost to an Athletes in Action
team that shot 35 percent from the field...
</P>
<P>
   Word in the Palouse is Gonzaga's Dan Monson may be the next
coach at Washington State if Kevin Eastman doesn't turn it around
quickly...
</P>
<P>
   Arizona walk-on guard Josh Pastner graduated Saturday, three
semesters ahead of schedule. Of course, Pastner ``majored'' in
family studies, just like that noted scholar, Miles Simon.

TESTAVERDE'S ABILITY TO AVOID SACKS HAS JETS ROLLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   These days, Vinny Testaverde is leading the life of luxury. He
stands in what has become one of the safest places in the National
Football League _ the New York Jets' pass pocket _ and fires away.
And when pass rushers actually do get close to him, he sidesteps
them with a mobility that is quite surprising for someone who is 6
feet 5 inches and 238 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Testaverde has now gone 15 quarters _ or nearly
four straight games _ without being sacked. No wonder the Jets
suddenly find themselves a victory away from their first division
title since 1969, a feat they can accomplish by beating the Buffalo
Bills on the road Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   In his first 11 seasons, many of them with inferior teams,
Testaverde was sacked an average of once for every 14 passes. This
year, he is being sacked just once every 20 attempts. Contrast this
situation with the one a year ago when Neil O'Donnell, who would
rather hold than run, got dumped once every 10 passes as the
primary Jets quarterback. Just when the Jets' attack was getting
started, someone would come along and throw O'Donnell down, and it
would be third-and-20.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't happening with Testaverde, who rarely puts the Jets
in a tough situation. His ability to sense pass pressure and
sidestep it, combined with a Jets offense that has a crew of good
pass blockers and good-hands receivers, has allowed Testaverde to
star on third down, which is when opposing defenses normally load
up on the pass rush and tear after the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Simply, Testaverde has become the most dangerous third-down
passer in the game. His quarterback rating, which factors in
various passing statistics, looks like a misprint: it is 128.3. By
contrast, the No. 2-rated passer in the league, the Green Bay
Packers' Brett Favre, is at 110.7. The Denver Broncos' John Elway
is at 96.1.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde is the only quarterback who hasn't thrown an
interception on third down. And only the Miami Dolphins' Dan Marino
has thrown as many touchdowns on third down _ 9 _ and he has thrown
56 more passes than Testaverde.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for all this success is that Testaverde runs
better than people think. Indeed, in his career he has scored 12
rushing touchdowns _ including the phantom winning score against
the Seattle Seahawks two Sundays ago on the quarterback sneak that
actually ended up a foot short. Testaverde also had the option to
pass the ball on that play but chose to try to make the yardage
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, he has a mobile quarterback's rushing statistics: he
came into the season with 297 carries and a 4.7 yards-a-run
average, and he actually once scored on a 48-yard jaunt. This
season, he has produced an 18-yard run and in Sunday night's 21-16
victory over the Dolphins, he ran twice in a row in one offensive
sequence, including a 9-yard sprint on a third-and-8.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to run when I have to,'' he said Tuesday. ``But in our
offense, with the options we have, I can get rid of the ball
quickly.''

MIDEAST TRIP SEEMS TO DISTANCE CLINTON FROM IMPEACHMENT WORRIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subbing 9th graf to correct number of undeclared Republicans) (htv) 
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Near the end of his uniquely stressful Middle
Eastern trip, with the second House impeachment vote in history
looming before him on his return to Washington, President Clinton
unaccountably grinned Tuesday when asked how he managed, as he
claimed, to insulate the peace effort from his deepening political
woes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You show up for work every day,'' he said, his eyes crinkling
up. ``It's not a complicated thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who accompanied Clinton here, said:
``He's boring in. It may well be that his collateral problems are
giving him more motivation for success here.'' On the flight here
on Saturday, Specter said the president ``projects obliviousness''
about impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was a puzzle during this trip, even to some of his
aides. He was clearly concerned about the impeachment vote,
occasionally checking on his position in calls to the chief of
staff, John D. Podesta, or one of his congressional experts, Steve
Ricchetti. But when forced by reporters to address the matter, he
seemed almost indifferent, and gave sullen answers that risked
tipping away the fence-sitters whose support he needs.
</P>
<P>
   He appeared able to put the matter completely out of his head.
Tuesday afternoon, his helicopter flew between tourist stops
commemorating Christian hope in the city of Bethlehem and Jewish
martyrdom on the mountaintop of Masada, where ancient Israeli
soldiers killed themselves rather than surrender to the Romans. The
president gave no outward sign that he absorbed the symbolism. In
transit, he sat quietly reading ``The History of the Jews,'' by
Paul Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last three days, Clinton gave two powerful, if somewhat
controversial, speeches on reinvigorating the peace effort, while
patiently shepherding Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime
minister, and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, back to the
bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
   James Zogby, the president of the Arab American Institute, spoke
with Clinton at lunch in Gaza City on Monday, and found him wound
up about his address later that day to the Palestinian National
Council. ``I think he was totally with the moment,'' Zogby said.
``He gets into that teaching mode, you know, that he gets into. He
was there.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Tom DeLay, the House majority whip, warned on Sunday
that the president was losing authority in foreign affairs,
Specter, a firm supporter of Israel, called the trip ``a
significant success.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has long deflected scandal and sustained his popularity
by focusing on his official duties and generating appealing
television images of himself and his family. But that approach
seems unlikely to help him much with his critical constituency now,
perhaps 18 undecided members of the House.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides acknowledged that the signs from Congress were
not positive for Clinton. ``You've got guys that we thought we
could get that have come out against us,'' a senior aide said.
``There are some people who are with us who seem to be softening.''
But ``the bottom line,'' he added, was that many members of the
House still had not declared a position.
</P>
<P>
   While they were in the Middle East, Clinton never spoke to his
congressional delegation about the possibility of impeachment,
according to Specter and White House aides. Indeed, it seemed on
Tuesday night that Clinton might drop his seeming indifference to
impeachment upon returning to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM HERE)
</P>
<P>
   While he and the congressmen did talk about other matters,
ranging from steel prices to scientific discoveries regarding stem
cells, they dwelled mostly on the peace effort, as they did during
a meeting for more than an hour over coffee and dessert on Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has focused,'' Specter said this evening as Clinton left.
``He's been very, very good.'' Of course, the deep hatreds, deadly
threats and freighted negotiations here would seem likely to focus
even an easily distracted mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's certainly energized by the trip,'' one of Clinton's
senior aides said. But at the same time, said another of his
advisers, also speaking on condition of anonymity, ``he's quite
aware of what's going on back home.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's tourism Tuesday seemed calculated more to advance the
peace effort than anything else, though the images of family comity
might also have pleased some Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In Bethlehem, with Arafat, Clinton managed to squeeze himself
through the 4-foot-high ``Door of Humility'' to enter the Church of
the Nativity. The president and his family spent about 10 minutes
in the basement, by the 14-point silver star that is said to mark
the spot where Jesus was born.
</P>
<P>
   In a striking demonstration of the strengthening relations
between the United States and a man it once treated as a terrorist,
Arafat and his wife, Suha, then stood side by side with the
Clintons as a choir of children sang ``O Little Town of Bethlehem''
and ``Joy to the World.'' Standing between her parents, Chelsea
looked up at her father with a big smile.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons then flew to Masada, a stark mountaintop by the
Dead Sea that is one of the Jews' most revered monuments to their
ancient struggle. For several months beginning in A.D. 72, a group
of 967 Jewish zealots held out there against a Roman siege before
their eventual suicides.
</P>
<P>
   With Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, the Clintons toured the site,
taking in the view of the Dead Sea and the Moab Mountains, and had
a traditional Middle Eastern meal of small mezze dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Every now and then in the last three days, Clinton has seemed to
veer in his public remarks toward an observation that applies as
easily to his predicament at home as to the peril here. In a toast
here on Sunday night, he said that during the mid-1980s, his former
pastor told him that he might be president some day.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will make mistakes,'' he recalled the pastor as having
said, ``and God will forgive you. But God will never forgive you if
you forget the State of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   He closed with a remark that could easily be read as a plea to
the House. ``We are instructed that they who judge without mercy
will be judged without mercy,'' Clinton said. ``But mercy triumphs
over judgment.''

LOS ANGELES TIMES TO LAY OFF 500, RESTRUCTURE   OPERATIONS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Admitting it is trailing other newspapers in eight
of 11 Southern California markets, the Los Angeles Times said on
Tuesday it will fire 500 employees and reorganize its local
operations into four regions.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper, a unit of L.A.-based Times Mirror Co., has
slashed 750 jobs, or about 12percent of its work force, since early
November in response to shrinking profits and disappointing ad
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The Times said yet another round of cost reductions will be
announced before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Times is currently the number two paper ... here, a
situation that we must reverse. To become the number one paper, we
need a nimble, decentralized organization in each of our diverse
regions that can compete more effectively,'' said Kathryn M.
Downing, the paper's president and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's cuts, announced 10 days before Christmas and during
Hanukkah, are concentrated in the paper's business units, including
380 telemarketing jobs eliminated in its circulation department.
Other firings were in the Times' finance, human resources and
administrative services divisions.
</P>
<P>
   The total of 500 cuts will cover 130 full-time and 370 part-time
positions. They amount to about 8 percent of the paper's payroll.
</P>
<P>
   No positions were eliminated in the news department during this
round of cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unfortunate time because we are disrupting people
during the holidays and we are disrupting families during the
holidays and I would prefer it not be at this time,'' Downing said.
</P>
<P>
   The paper's new strategy calls for creating two new regions for
business purposes: Los Angeles and the Inland Empire/San Gabriel
Valley region. The Times has Orange County and San Fernando
Valley/Ventura County regions.
</P>
<P>
   Downing said the paper's regular metro edition will continue to
be included in the new regions' editions while management decides
whether to offer readers a regionalized news product similar to
those produced for the Valley and Ventura, and Orange counties.
</P>
<P>
   Full-time employees being fired will receive 18 weeks to two
years of pay, depending on their length of service, while part-time
workers will get from 12 to 18 weeks of pay.
</P>
<P>
   Times Mirror will take a charge of up to $225 million this year
to pay for the restructuring. Its stock closed Tuesday at $55.25,
up 6.25 cents. The cuts were announced after the market closed.
</P>
<P>
   The firings come a week after the company announced it was
giving $1 million to Columbia University's Graduate School of
Journalism to fund a visiting professorship to study diversity in
media issues.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper spokesman Mike Lang said the paper also is planning to
introduce up to 12 ``Our Times'' community news editions next year
throughout Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper industry analyst John Morton said large newspapers
like the Times ``are trying to both broaden and deepen their
franchise and one way to do that is create regional or zoned
editions and attempt to be more than just the big metro paper.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Times Mirror has shed assets to focus on its
newspapers, which include the Baltimore Sun and Newsday on Long
Island, N.Y. But high costs and a soft advertising market,
particularly for classified ads, have led to reduced expectations
for the company and a 10 percent decline in the company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Downing said it is ``critical'' to cut costs wherever possible
to improve the bottom line.

CLINTON LOSING POTENTIAL SUPPORTERS IN IMPEACHMENT VOTE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: optional ending included) 
 
By JOHN C. HENRY 
and BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's chances of winning a House
impeachment vote dimmed Tuesday as key Republican moderates,
including several from the Democratic-friendly Northeast, announced
plans to vote against the president.
</P>
<P>
   Buffeted by a steady loss of potential supporters, Clinton,
flying home from the Middle East, was weighing advice to again
publicly apologize, but to include a full confession of any
wrongdoing in his effort to conceal his affair with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Speaker-elect Bob Livingston, a New Orleans
Republican, said Clinton should quit in order to end the crisis
engulfing his presidency. ``If the president wants to stop putting
the country through this, he has options available to him, one of
which is resignation,'' Livingston said in an interview with the
New Orleans Times-Picayune.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston's advice to the president makes it unanimous among
top House Republicans who are preparing for only the second
presidential impeachment vote in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton arrives in Washington early today on the eve of the
House impeachment showdown, he will find he has lost the support of
several of the two dozen Republican moderates he had hoped would
side with him against GOP conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was Rep. Jack Quinn, a New York Republican who last
week said he would oppose impeachment and on Tuesday reversed
course. Rep. Chris Shays, R-Conn., an early impeachment opponent,
softened his position Monday and is to meet with Clinton on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   New York Reps. Michael Forbes, Sue Kelly and John McHugh all
held news conferences to announce their belief that Clinton
committed impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Also declaring her intent to support impeachment was Rep. Nancy
Johnson, a Connecticut Republican who has been supportive of
Clinton. ``The president does not have the right to commit perjury
when it is convenient or when he thinks the charges against him are
frivolous,'' Johnson said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Other moderate Republicans who said Tuesday they would support
impeachment are Reps. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., Ann Northrup, R-Ky.,
Clay Shaw, R-Fla., and Fred Upton, R-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic House Caucus Chairman Martin Frost of Texas said
White House and Democratic efforts to win over enough moderate
Republican votes to stave off impeachment have all but failed.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans ``have got the votes'' to impeach, Frost said.
``Republicans are cracking the whip and they're trying to get all
their moderates in line, and they`re going to get most of them.
They're leaning on them pretty hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans hold 228 of the 435 House seats; Democrats hold 206,
and four of them have announced plans to side with the GOP. The
lone House independent has said he will side with Clinton. So far,
three moderate Republicans have said they will oppose impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The White House welcomed proposals from one undecided Republican
moderate, Rep. Michael Castle of Delaware, and from former GOP
presidential nominee Bob Dole for rebuking Clinton but not removing
him from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even at this late date, there are compelling reasons to pursue
a different course with a better solution for our nation,'' said
Castle, who urged the House leadership to allow a vote on a tough
censure resolution that would require Clinton to pay at least $2
million toward the costs of the Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, a former U.S. senator who unsuccessfully challenged
Clinton's re-election in 1996, proposed that Congress end the
impeachment battle by passing a joint resolution of censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot imagine a better way for Republicans to start the new
year than by taking charge and producing just results at this
historic moment,'' Dole wrote in the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   The Castle and Dole proposals were characterized as ``thoughtful
and serious'' by White House spokesman Jim Kennedy. ``While we
haven't endorsed any specific plan, we welcome efforts to find a
bipartisan solution that would allow us to put this behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   Some White House advisers are urging Clinton to make a bold move
to avert impeachment. Aides confirmed that strategy discussions
include the logistically difficult and politically hazardous
appearance before the full House to deliver a plea for censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president can make his case in person before the full
House better than anyone,'' former White House special counsel
Lanny Davis told reporters. ``He should expose himself to that
process, answer questions and be prepared to acknowledge the
reality of what he has done.''
</P>
<P>
   Frost was pessimistic about the prospects of turning enough
Republican votes. ``The Republicans are pushing their people so
hard that I'm not sure there's anything the president could do that
would satisfy them,'' he said. ``They've decided for political
reasons that they want to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston late Tuesday reaffirmed his opposition to allowing
House members to vote on anything other than an impeachment
resolution, which seeks to terminate Clinton's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   A House vote for impeachment Thursday would formally charge
Clinton with ``high crimes and misdemeanors,'' the standard set by
the Constitution for removing a president once two-thirds, or 67
members, of the Senate vote for conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Only one other president, Andrew Johnson, has been impeached by
the House. He went on trial in the Senate in March 1868, and after
74 days of testimony and arguments, which Johnson never attended,
he was acquitted by one vote.
</P>
<P>
   The four articles of impeachment, approved on a party-line vote
last week by the House Judiciary Committee, accuse Clinton of
perjury in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit, perjury
before a federal grand jury, obstructing justice and abuse of
power. All four stem from the president's efforts to conceal his
White House affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A CBS/New York Times poll released Tuesday evening found that 58
percent of adult Americans believe the president should not resign
if he faces a Senate trial. The survey contradicts an ABC
News/Washington Post poll, which on Monday reported that 58 percent
of adult Americans say Clinton should quit if the House votes to
send his case to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, feminist leaders Betty Friedan and Eleanor Smeal held
a news conference to express outrage at the impeachment drive.
Friedan, a women's movement pioneer, blamed the president's
troubles on ``a bunch of dirty old white men,'' trying to overturn
an election result.
</P>
<P>
   Friedan and Smeal emerged from a hastily scheduled meeting with
Livingston to report that he rebuffed their plea for censure rather
than impeachment. Livingston ``compared Clinton to (Richard) Nixon
and said Clinton was worse,'' said Smeal, president of the Feminist
Majority Foundation. ``After this, the impression you have is
there's no stopping and there's no pausing'' on the way to
impeachment.

SPORTS COLUMN: PATRIOTS SEEK GREENER PASTURES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Having siphoned off all the loose funds in one small town, that
charming cinematic scamp known as the Music Man was asked where he
was moving next.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wherever the people are as green as the money,'' he announced.
</P>
<P>
   There are lots of Music Men in sports, which is why peripatetic
teams leave their trail of tears from time zone to time zone,
seeking their pie in the sky box.
</P>
<P>
   In the spirit of Prof. Harold Hill, we now have Robert Kraft
trying to slip his New England Patriots across the Massachusetts
border. Tuesday night the Connecticut legislature was debating
whether to give the Patriots an extravagant gift to put Hartford on
the big-time map.
</P>
<P>
   The zeal of Gov. John Rowland would be hilarious if it did not
have such crushing implications for the citizens, who would build a
stadium at the edge of downtown for $375 million.
</P>
<P>
   This is the normal sports boondoggle. What made Rowland's deal
so generous is that taxpayers would subsidize up to $13 million a
year for unsold luxury boxes and club seats _ a bargain, whittled
down from $17.5 million the governor had been willing to give.
</P>
<P>
   Sports franchises and major events are usually a good deal for
everybody but the locals who pay the bills. The 68,000-seat stadium
would be used mainly for two exhibitions and eight regular-season
games of the Patriots and five games of the University of
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The National Football League points out that the Patriots had
been willing to stay in Massachusetts in a privately financed
stadium, but House Speaker Thomas Finneran would not approve a $72
million package in land and improvements around Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, it also looks as if the league would lose status
in the transition from Boston, the 20th largest city in the
country, to Hartford, which has lost 18.1 percent of its population
since 1990, and has fallen to 184th in population.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have lived off the considerable aura of Boston
since their early days in the 1960s, when they scuttled around like
some rogue MTA train, from Harvard to Fenway Park to Boston
University to Boston College. In reality, there is precious little
urbane about the Patriots, who have been playing, since 1971, in a
rickety stadium in Foxboro, Mass., closer to Providence, R.I., than
to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our clubs are not necessarily going to think of this as a move
from Boston to Hartford, but rather a move from Massachusetts to
Connecticut,'' said Joe Browne, the senior vice president of
communications and government affairs for the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, all visiting teams fly into Providence before a game,
which essentially means that for 27 years no professional football
players have been roaming around downtown Boston, which is just as
good.
</P>
<P>
   As franchise shifts go, this is no biggie. The Rams left
populous Orange County in California for St. Louis, the
49th-largest city; the Raiders fled Los Angeles, the nation's
second-most populous city, to return to Oakland, the 44th-largest;
and the Oilers left Houston, the fourth-largest city, and moved to
Nashville, the 25th-largest city.
</P>
<P>
   One could even make the point that the most-populous city in the
country does not have a team, since the Giants and Jets both play
in another state to the west, but the double triumphs last Sunday
were surely felt in the city itself.
</P>
<P>
   The league smarts at not having teams in L.A. and Houston, and
will surely fill one gap with an expansion team in the next few
years. However, market size is not a gigantic problem in the NFL
since the stadiums are essentially television studios, beaming
games for free.
</P>
<P>
   The league can tolerate some small markets, which is why Green
Bay, the 207th market at 104,500 residents, is a jewel of a
franchise, locally owned, able to afford stars and win Super Bowl
XXXI. For every Packer home game, fans drive from all over
Wisconsin, and there is every reason to assume that most current
Patriot fans will do the same in New England _ and if they don't,
there are always new fans. Besides, the stadium in Foxboro is a
dump, with the worst access roads in sports.
</P>
<P>
   The league can tolerate small markets because of the current
television contract for $18 billion over eight years. Under the
most intelligent revenue-sharing policy in professional sports,
each of 30 teams makes an identical $58 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts can console itself that losing 10 home football
games a year is nothing like losing a baseball team, with its 81
home games. The Bay State can celebrate its stand against giveaways
Wednesday _ the 225th anniversary of the Boston Tea Party. Wonder
what the real patriots in Boston Harbor would have thought about
the proposed giveaway one colony away.?

BASEBALL AGENTS' NEGOTIATING TACTICS CRITICIZED
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ An executive involved in record-setting
contract talks for Kevin Brown said Tuesday that serious problems
exist in the way teams and agents negotiate, and that corrective
action is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Brown signed a seven-year, $105 million contract with the Los
Angeles Dodgers at the beginning of the winter meetings, which
ended blandly here Tuesday with several minor free-agent signings.
Brown turned down offers from the San Diego Padres, for whom he
played this past season, and others.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of Brown's agreement, Larry Lucchino, the San
Diego president, contacted high-ranking members of other
organizations to review the negotiations. He is convinced that the
teams reacted to what he called misinformation from Brown's agent,
Scott Boras.
</P>
<P>
   The best evidence of this, Lucchino said, is in the offers teams
say that they made to Brown. Lucchino said that the Padres offered
Brown a six-year, $60 million deal _ $8 million in 1999, $9 million
in 2000, $10 million in 2001, $11 million in 2002, $12 million in
2003 and $10 million in 2004. The Baltimore Orioles offered Brown a
five-year, $55 million contract, according to two high-ranking
members of that organization who spoke on the condition of
anonymity. The St. Louis Cardinals never made Brown a formal offer,
according to the general manager, Walt Jocketty.
</P>
<P>
   Lucchino said that the Colorado Rockies offered Brown a six-year
deal with the final year of the contract partly guaranteed; Jerry
McMorris, the Rockies' owner, would not confirm Lucchino's
contention or divulge the exact nature of his offer. Reportedly,
Colorado's offer would not have surpassed $81 million if the sixth
year was guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   If all the figures are accurate, then the Dodgers' final offer
surpassed that made by any other team. Lucchino contends this is
partly because they were led to believe the offers from other teams
were higher than they actually were. Lucchino suggested that the
Dodgers offered Brown one more year and perhaps $35 million to $40
million more than any other team ``and that certainly puts an
interesting perspective on the negotiations, certainly.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucchino would not comment directly on how Boras negotiated.
Boras could not immediately be reached for comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm talking about the objective facts about the
negotiations,'' Lucchino said, ``and whether there are flaws in
structure of the process that allows for blindman's bluff. There is
a growing concern about the process that allows for this type of
misinformation circulating.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Peter Angelos, the Orioles' owner: ``This is a many-faceted
problem that needs to be addressed in a number of specific ways.''
</P>
<P>
   McMorris added: ``I don't see anything but good in looking for
ways to improve the system. I know where Larry's coming from, and I
share most of his concern. But it's over and done with and the
player has gone to the Dodgers.''
</P>
<P>
   Teams are not permitted to collude and share directly what
offers they are making. But Lucchino believes teams should somehow
be able to verify that offers have been made. One method being
discussed, Lucchino said, would be to reveal all offers through the
news media. Another would to be to require that all offers be made
in writing.
</P>
<P>
   Lucchino is intrigued by an another owner's proposal that all
offers would have to go through a third party, a verifier. ``If an
agent says that there is an offer from another team, you could then
go to the verifier and determine if there was indeed such an
offer,'' Lucchino said.
</P>
<P>
   Boras also represented Bernie Williams, the Yankees' center
fielder, in his free-agent negotiations this off season. During
talks last month, Boras repeatedly told the Yankees that he had
multiple offers of seven and eight years for Williams, and some
within the Yankees' organization did not believe the agent. George
Steinbrenner, the Yankees' owner, challenged Boras to reveal his
offers, but Boras would not. ``I don't think he has anything,''
Steinbrenner said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   After the Yankees signed Williams to a seven-year, $87.5 million
contract, baseball officials say, the Yankees were told by the
Player Relations Committee that the Arizona Diamondbacks offered
Williams an eight-year, $100 million contract _ confirmation of
Boras' contention. Boston also offered a seven-year deal.
</P>

<P>
   Brown's signing was the highlight of the generally uneventful
winter meetings. The Blue Jays had hoped to trade Roger Clemens
here, but Toronto officials left here Tuesday afternoon not really
sure in what direction those negotiations would turn. The Texas
Rangers seem willing to renegotiate Clemens' contract but unable to
produce the players wanted by the Blue Jays; Houston, Cleveland and
the Yankees are balking at the idea of trading players and then
giving Clemens a contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland General Manager John Hart said Tuesday that the
chances of his team landing Clemens were remote, but the Indians
may have forwarded the most intriguing offer _ outfielder Manny
Ramirez. Cleveland reportedly offered Ramirez for Clemens, one for
one, but Toronto asked for at least three additional players.
</P>
<P>
   The most notable trade of the meetings was St. Louis'
acquisition of shortstop Edgar Renteria; in return, the Cardinals
sent pitcher Braden Looper, shortstop Pablo Ozuna and the
left-handed reliever Armando Almanza to the Florida Marlins.

COLTEC SHARES RISE AS CRANE TRIES TO BLOCK GOODRICH DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By SHARON R. KING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shares of Coltec Industries rose $2 on Tuesday, or 12
percent, as Crane Co. pursued its attempt to block a planned $1.3
billion merger between Coltec and B.F. Goodrich.
</P>
<P>
   Goodrich said it had no plans to drop its offer to buy Coltec, a
maker of aerospace components and industrial products in Charlotte,
N.C. But several Coltec shareholders expressed interest in hearing
Crane's offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to pursue the completion of the merger,'' said Rob
Jewell, a Goodrich spokesman. ``B.F. Goodrich has a binding
agreement with Coltec Industries to merge.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Crane filed a surprise lawsuit against Coltec and
Goodrich, contending that Coltec, by accepting the Goodrich offer,
had broken a 1995 promise to notify Crane of any offers to buy the
company.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan,
seeks to allow Crane to present its offer, which had never been
publicly disclosed, to Coltec's board. It also asks the court to
prohibit the companies from enacting anti-takeover provisions in
their agreement that make it prohibitively expensive for another
company to make an offer for Coltec.
</P>
<P>
   No hearings have yet been scheduled in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Goodrich agreed to acquire Coltec, offering 0.56
share of Goodrich common stock for each Coltec share. The deal also
calls for Goodrich, which is based in Richfield, Ohio, to assume
$610 million in debt. The transaction would be accounted for as a
pooling of interests and would be tax-free to Coltec shareholders.
As of Tuesday, the Goodrich offer was worth about $1.3 billion,
excluding debt.
</P>
<P>
   Goodrich, which left the tire business in the 1980s,
manufactures aircraft-landing gear systems and other aerospace
components.
</P>
<P>
   In letters sent to Coltec chief executive John Guffey, Crane had
offered 0.80 share for each outstanding Coltec share. Coltec has
about 70 million shares outstanding, a company official said.
Crane's offer was worth about $1.6 billion Tuesday, excluding the
debt.
</P>
<P>
   Coltec's stock traded as high as $19.4375 a share Tuesday before
closing at $18.6875. Crane shares fell 25 cents, to $27.75, while
those of Goodrich rose 56.25 cents, to $33.5625.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Gabelli, the chief investment officer of Gabelli Asset
Management, which owns about 2.6 million shares of Coltec and 1.4
million shares of Crane, said that Coltec shareholders should be
presented with Crane's offer.
</P>
<P>
   Gabelli also said he was waiting for Coltec to respond to the
suit to determine whether the company had accepted an inferior
Goodrich bid while knowing about the Crane offer.

NATURE CONSERVANCY BUYS MAINE FOREST TRACT  
(JT) 
 &HT;    
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In an effort to preserve a chunk of Maine wilderness,
an international conservation group announced Tuesday that it was
buying 185,000 acres of forest from a paper company.
</P>
<P>
   The $35.1 million purchase by the Nature Conservancy, the
largest of its kind ever in Maine, comprises two tracts in the
remote northwest corner of the state on the Canadian border. It
includes about 40 miles of the renowned Upper St. John River, an
ecological powerhouse that has one of the highest concentrations of
rare plants in Maine. International Paper Co. has owned most of the
land since the 1920s, using the timberland as a working forest, but
preserving the river area as part of a voluntary agreement with the
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a river that you can put your canoe in and paddle 120
miles without seeing a single house or development,'' said Kent
Wommack, executive director of the the Nature Conservancy in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The Upper St. John, the longest free-flowing river east of the
Mississippi, was threatened with inundation in the 1960s by the
proposed Dickey-Lincoln dam project. A bitter fight on the part of
conservation groups saved it.
</P>
<P>
   The Nature Conservancy plans to keep the lands open for fishing,
hunting, canoeing and other recreation. The woodlands may continue
to supply timber for Maine's paper mills.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came a week after environmentalists cheered a
purchase of 300,000 acres of forest land in New York, Vermont and
New Hampshire from the Champion International paper company for $76
million.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Maine's forest land has changed hands, with about 15
percent of the state going up for sale this year. More land on the
market means more preservation opportunities for conservation
groups, Wommack said, but more openings for land developers .
</P>
<P>
   ``Once land is sold for development, it can never really be
recovered,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Nature Conservancy already owns 10 million acres in North
America. Buying means less dependence on land owners to voluntarily
protect their environmentally important holdings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gentlemen's agreements are great, and we have many with many
landowners, but for a resource that is as nationally significant as
this, it really deserves to be permanently protected,'' Wommack
said.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Hutchinson, executive director for the Forest Society of
Maine, said the area is a home to deer, bears, osprey, great herons
and the Furbish lousewort, a wild snapdragon that grows nowhere
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Maine we've become very spoiled in thinking that these
wonderful things we find in the North Woods would be here
forever,'' Hutchinson said. ``I think they've guaranteed that these
attributes that we've taken for granted for so long will be in
place.''

 &HT;    Day off to honor Chiles
 &HT;    By Charles Elmore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE _ The closing of state offices for the funeral of
Lawton Chiles today has officials scrambling to reschedule events
and in some cases deciding reluctantly to stay open despite Gov.
Buddy MacKay's executive order.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the state's 206,485 employees will be given the day off,
at a cost of $21 million for their salaries, according to the state
Comptroller's office.
</P>
<P>
   No one in the governor's press office could remember the last
time state government was shut down for a day or mourning. The last
governor to die office was Dan McCarty in 1953. State government
has been closed as recently as this year, however, for weather
reasons including hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   The state court system will be closed, though individual judges
will have the discretion to make exceptions for matters previously
scheduled or for emergencies, Chief Supreme Court Justice Major
Harding ordered Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Harding and the other six justices on the state Supreme Court
will not work so they can attend the funeral Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to honor Gov. Chiles,'' Harding said, ``and we will
do it in a way that does not cause needless legal problems for
Florida's people.''
</P>
<P>
   All court deadlines will be extended by a day, so Dec. 16 will
not count toward time limits imposed by rule and statute.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement's 1,500
employees will be given the day off, though an emergency crew
handling criminal-justice information and records will remain on
duty, a spokeswoman said. A number of FDLE officials will attending
or participating in the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Highway Patrol officers will be on the road, though office
workers in the department will be off, and an extra 30 to 35
officers will be assisting with the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Final examinations will go on as scheduled today at the
University of Florida and the law school at Florida State
University, the state's Board of Regents has decided.
</P>
<P>
   ``We mean no disrespect in keeping the exam schedule, but after
discussing the matter with UF and FSU administrators, it became
clear that final exams simply will have to continue at these two
institutions,'' said Acting State Chancellor James Mau in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students, parents and other family members make holiday travel
plans around the final exam schedule, which is set months in
advance,'' he continued. ``To change that schedule now has the
potential to cause undue problems for thousands of students,
including those who graduate this week.''

STANFORD'S COLLINS AGAIN BITTEN BY BAD LUCK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Fixes name of Sciulli in 18th graph) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Stanford freshman Jason Collins is big, fast,
skilled, intelligent and insightful. But apparently, he was born
without luck.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, a reserve center, had wrist surgery Tuesday and will
miss the remainder of the season. It's the latest setback for the
North Hollywood resident and Harvard-Westlake High graduate, who
played in one game last year because of a knee injury that required
two surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was faced with no alternative,'' Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery said Tuesday. ``Each doctor he talked to recommended
(surgery), so he resigned himself to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much to say. There's not much positive you can
make out of it, because he was playing well and helping the team
and anxious to get back on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins averaged four points and three rebounds in 13 minutes
per game for the No. 7 Cardinal (5-2). He outplayed starting center
Tim Young in several games and was improving by the week, slowly
regaining the timing and confidence that made him one of the
nation's top recruits in 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
   But on Dec. 6, he fell against George Washington and dislocated
his right wrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times guys fall and sprain their wrists, but this was
a different situation,'' Montgomery said. ``Of the small bones in
the wrist, all of them moved. A lot of stuff had to be tied back
together. There wasn't much choice. The alternative was a cast for
two months and another (month) to rehab.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins redshirted last season after tearing meniscus cartilage
in November. He could request a sixth year of eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're investigating,'' Montgomery said. ``But that's not
something that happens every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins will have company on the bench, at least for the moment.
Reserve shooting guard Ryan Mendez will miss several weeks with a
stress reaction in his knee, and reserve point guard Mike McDonald
is out 5-7 weeks with a foot injury.
</P>
<P>
   Coaching dominoes: When Phil Jackson parted company with the
Chicago Bulls in June, it created a ripple effect through the
college coaching ranks that ended with a construction company in
Northern California. The tide of events:
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was replaced by Iowa State's Tim Floyd on July 23.
</P>
<P>
   Five days later, Iowa State hired Utah State's Larry Eustachy.
</P>
<P>
   Utah State hired Colorado State's Stew Morrill on Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado State hired Portland State's Ritchie McKay on Aug. 21.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, Portland State promoted assistant Joel Sobotka to
replace McKay.
</P>
<P>
   Sobotka then hired Santa Clara assistant Sam Sciulli.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Santa Clara replaced Sciulli with Jason Sedlock, a
former player who had been working construction while trying to
break into the coaching business.
</P>
<P>
   Seniors to watch: Keep an eye on Pittsburgh's Vonteego Cummings
and Boise State's Roberto Bergersen during the season and,
especially, as the NBA Draft approaches. Unknown to most of the
nation, they're well-regarded by NBA scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Cummings, a 6-4 guard, was the best athlete in the Puerto Rico
Shootout and proved to one Western Conference scout he could run an
offense despite his scoring instincts. A second-team All-Big East
pick last year, Cummings is averaging 17 points with 49 assists and
31 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Bergersen, a 6-6 wing man, is a Seattle native who played one
year at Washington before transferring to Boise State. He's a
better prospect than Washington's Donald Watts, one scout said, and
scored 60 points in two games in the Indiana Classic last week.
He's averaging 23.9 points, fifth in the country, and shooting 54.8
percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Around the nation: The conclusion of the fall semester signals
eligibility for three impact players. Georgia Tech center Jason
Collier scored 22 points Sunday in his first game since
transferring from Indiana. Arizona State forward Mike Batiste will
play Saturday after missing eight games because of academics. New
Mexico forward Kenny Thomas also returns Saturday; he was suspended
for the semester because of an NCAA eligibility issue dating to his
freshman season...
</P>
<P>
   Think Michigan officials are regretting the promotion of Brian
Ellerbe from interim to permanent coach last spring? He's 0-4
against Mid-American Conference competition in just over a year.
This season, the Wolverines have lost to Western Michigan, Florida
International and Ball State. Duke beat them by a school-record 44
points Saturday...
</P>
<P>
   After an unimpressive first month, Kentucky's Scott Padgett
played like an All-American with 25 points and 13 rebounds in the
Wildcats' victory over Maryland...
</P>
<P>
   Jim Harrick has Rhode Island rounding into form just in time for
his visit to Pepperdine on Dec. 29. URI improved to 5-4 with a
victory Saturday at Ohio. ``We had Kentucky in here last year,''
Ohio coach Larry Hunter said. ``I think this team today was as good
as any we've had here in a few years.''...
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's victory over San Francisco in the Puerto Rico Shootout
may carry more weight in the power rankings than first thought. The
Dons are 7-3 _ their best start since reviving basketball in 1985 _
and are playing so well San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown attended a
recent game...
</P>
<P>
   Portland State wing man Jason Hartman, a Thousand Oaks native
who played one season at Washington, scored 34 points in a 73-62
loss to Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Around the Pacific-10: The most disappointing team so far is
Washington, which lost at Boise State and Gonzaga last week. The
Huskies are simply overscheduled. They played three games in three
days in Hawaii, then flew straight to Chicago for a Great-Eight
loss to Connecticut. They were home for two days before heading to
Boise and Spokane...
</P>
<P>
   That was no misprint: Oregon State lost to an Athletes in Action
team that shot 35 percent from the field...
</P>
<P>
   Word in the Palouse is Gonzaga's Dan Monson may be the next
coach at Washington State if Kevin Eastman doesn't turn it around
quickly...
</P>
<P>
   Arizona walk-on guard Josh Pastner graduated Saturday, three
semesters ahead of schedule. Of course, Pastner ``majored'' in
family studies, just like that noted scholar, Miles Simon.

 &HT;    Last-gasp block of sale to appease growers
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving in General News (a) and Financial (f) categories.)
 &HT;    By Larry Lipman and Robert P. King
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Less than 48 hours before the federal government
planned to buy a Glades sugar empire in a crucial step toward
restoring the Everglades, a judge temporarily blocked the sale
Tuesday at the behest of growers who say the deal could hurt the
environment and the economy.
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling that surprised state officials and environmental
activists, U.S. District Judge Thomas F. Hogan stayed Thursday
morning's scheduled $133.5 million sale of Talisman Sugar Corp.'s
50,960 acres to the Interior Department. Hogan scheduled further
hearings Jan. 22, saying he still knows too little about the sale
to decide which side is right.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan made no decision on an injunction the growers had sought,
and he left open the opportunity for either side to seek an
emergency hearing today. He also said the government and Talisman's
parent, Jacksonville-based St. Joe Co., can put the money and title
in escrow. That would allow a neutral party _ such as a bank or a
title company _ to hold them until he makes a ruling.
</P>
<P>
   That means moneycan change hands at Thursday's scheduled closing
in suburban West Palm Beach, involving St. Joe, the Interior
Department and the government's middleman, The Nature Conservancy.
But the sides can't finish the sale.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling ``doesn't cause harm to either side,'' said Interior
Department negotiator
</P>
<P>
   Curtis ``Buff'' Bohlen. ``All sides are committed to the sale.
We just have to wait.''
</P>
<P>
   But the ruling surprised environmentalists, along with the South
Florida water managers who hope to end up owning much of the
Talisman land.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a death knell,'' said Thom Rumberger, attorney for
the Everglades Foundation. ``It's simply that the court is going
slower.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Miedema, spokeswoman for the Sugar Cane Growers
Cooperative of Florida, called on the government to ``follow its
own rules.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to take into account the economic and human and
environmental consequences'' of the sale, said Miedema, whose group
filed the lawsuit last month along with the farming area cities of
Pahokee and Belle Glade and three subsidiaries of Palm Beach-based
Florida Crystals Corp.
</P>
<P>
   They argued that the Interior Department has failed to conduct a
legally required study of how the sale would affect the Everglades
and the economy. But federal officials say the study is unnecessary
because the land will remain in farming for several years while the
government decides how exactly to use the tracts.
</P>
<P>
   Many hopes are riding on the sale of Talisman's holdings in Palm
Beach and Hendry counties, which Vice President Al Gore announced
with much fanfare last year at the 50th anniversary of Everglades
National Park.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has said the land could form
the heart of 60,000 acres of reservoirs needed to replenish the
Everglades. The proposed reservoirs are a fulcrum of the federal
government's $7.8 billion Everglades restoration plan.
</P>
<P>
   But the Interior Department has offered to swap some of
Talisman's scattered parcels to other sugar companies, which could
wind up with land more fertile than their own. In return, the
government would end up with a solid block of land near the
Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   Water managers, meanwhile, hope the swaps would give them land
for a separate, $763 million project aimed at cleaning up farm
drainage flowing into the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   But the talks have stalled over the details of the swaps. The
sugar companies say federal proposals would force them to give up
too much land. Meanwhile, the federal government has resisted a
proposal supported by the state and the South Florida Water
Management District; that deal wouldn't have left the federal
government with enough land, Bohlen said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Lawton Chiles tried to unravel the tangle during a trip to
Washington on Friday, the day before he died. But the growers
rejected the government's latest offer Sunday, Interior Department
counsel Bill Leary said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Chiles) would have made a difference,'' Leary said
Tuesday. ``It's just going to be a little bit more difficult
without his presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Bohlen, the federal negotiator, said no further talks will take
place until Hogan rules. But Bill Malone, the water district's land
management director, said he hopes the feds reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are tantalizingly close to a solution,'' Malone said.

 &HT;    Last-gasp block of sale to appease growers

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Less than 48 hours before the federal government
planned to buy a Glades sugar empire in a crucial step toward
restoring the Everglades, a judge temporarily blocked the sale
Tuesday at the behest of growers who say the deal could hurt the
environment and the economy.
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling that surprised state officials and environmental
activists, U.S. District Judge Thomas F. Hogan stayed Thursday
morning's scheduled $133.5 million sale of Talisman Sugar Corp.'s
50,960 acres to the Interior Department. Hogan scheduled further
hearings Jan. 22, saying he still knows too little about the sale
to decide which side is right.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan made no decision on an injunction the growers had sought,
and he left open the opportunity for either side to seek an
emergency hearing today. He also said the government and Talisman's
parent, Jacksonville-based St. Joe Co., can put the money and title
in escrow. That would allow a neutral party _ such as a bank or a
title company _ to hold them until he makes a ruling.
</P>
<P>
   That means moneycan change hands at Thursday's scheduled closing
in suburban West Palm Beach, involving St. Joe, the Interior
Department and the government's middleman, The Nature Conservancy.
But the sides can't finish the sale.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling ``doesn't cause harm to either side,'' said Interior
Department negotiator
</P>
<P>
   Curtis ``Buff'' Bohlen. ``All sides are committed to the sale.
We just have to wait.''
</P>
<P>
   But the ruling surprised environmentalists, along with the South
Florida water managers who hope to end up owning much of the
Talisman land.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a death knell,'' said Thom Rumberger, attorney for
the Everglades Foundation. ``It's simply that the court is going
slower.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Miedema, spokeswoman for the Sugar Cane Growers
Cooperative of Florida, called on the government to ``follow its
own rules.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to take into account the economic and human and
environmental consequences'' of the sale, said Miedema, whose group
filed the lawsuit last month along with the farming area cities of
Pahokee and Belle Glade and three subsidiaries of Palm Beach-based
Florida Crystals Corp.
</P>
<P>
   They argued that the Interior Department has failed to conduct a
legally required study of how the sale would affect the Everglades
and the economy. But federal officials say the study is unnecessary
because the land will remain in farming for several years while the
government decides how exactly to use the tracts.
</P>
<P>
   Many hopes are riding on the sale of Talisman's holdings in Palm
Beach and Hendry counties, which Vice President Al Gore announced
with much fanfare last year at the 50th anniversary of Everglades
National Park.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has said the land could form
the heart of 60,000 acres of reservoirs needed to replenish the
Everglades. The proposed reservoirs are a fulcrum of the federal
government's $7.8 billion Everglades restoration plan.
</P>
<P>
   But the Interior Department has offered to swap some of
Talisman's scattered parcels to other sugar companies, which could
wind up with land more fertile than their own. In return, the
government would end up with a solid block of land near the
Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   Water managers, meanwhile, hope the swaps would give them land
for a separate, $763 million project aimed at cleaning up farm
drainage flowing into the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   But the talks have stalled over the details of the swaps. The
sugar companies say federal proposals would force them to give up
too much land. Meanwhile, the federal government has resisted a
proposal supported by the state and the South Florida Water
Management District; that deal wouldn't have left the federal
government with enough land, Bohlen said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Lawton Chiles tried to unravel the tangle during a trip to
Washington on Friday, the day before he died. But the growers
rejected the government's latest offer Sunday, Interior Department
counsel Bill Leary said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Chiles) would have made a difference,'' Leary said
Tuesday. ``It's just going to be a little bit more difficult
without his presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Bohlen, the federal negotiator, said no further talks will take
place until Hogan rules. But Bill Malone, the water district's land
management director, said he hopes the feds reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are tantalizingly close to a solution,'' Malone said.

 &HT;    Proposal for new arena rejected
 &HT;    By Mark Rosner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A plan proposed by the San Antonio Spurs to have
a new basketball arena built northeast of downtown has been
rejected by a local school board whose approval was necessary, most
likely killing the project.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting that started Monday night and did not end until
after 1:30 a.m. Tuesday, the North East School District voted 5-2
to withdraw from discussions of a plan that would have dedicated
all property taxes generated by new development in part of the
district as well as increased property appraisals to pay for the
$157 million arena. The arena would have been paid for in 20 to 30
years.
</P>
<P>
   For the plan to reach fruition, approval was needed from the
City of San Antonio, Bexar County and the school district. The
arena would have been located on the abandoned Longhorn Quarry,
which is within the district's boundries.
</P>
<P>
   The rejection ultimately could result in the Spurs moving to
another city, although they have made no such threats. The Spurs
have played in the Alamodome since 1993. But their ownership
believes that the Dome, which was built primarily with hopes of
attracting a National Football League team, is not suitable under
current economic conditions in professional sports. The escalating
salaries of pro athletes are often funded with revenue from luxury
boxes. Though the Dome has 32 luxury boxes available for
basketball, the Spurs say they are too far from the court. Only 14
of the 32 boxes were rented last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Spurs are not the enemy, and I hope we're not the enemy,''
said board member Bill McCabe, who voted to pull out of the
discussions. ``This is an issue about how to finance the arena,
period.''
</P>
<P>
   The City Council is scheduled to vote Thursday on whether to
create the 3,200-acre tax-increment finance (TIF) district needed
to fund the arena. Mayor Howard Peak has said that without the
school board's approval, the project will die.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Spurs' Chairman Peter Holt nor any of his high-level
subordinates were available for comment Tuesday. Team spokesman Tom
James said they would not comment until assessing their options for
the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we believed the proposal on the table would work,''
James said. ``All we can do at this point is sit down with the
ownership group and consulting staff and figure out what the next
step will be. Until we've had those discussions, we can't
speculate.''
</P>
<P>
   Among possible options for the Spurs are remaining in the
Alamodome; building an arena financed by a sales tax increase, as
was the Dome; selling the team; or moving to another city. Public
opinion surveys taken by the Spurs have indicated local citizens
would be unwilling to support a sales tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, school board president Bruce Bennett, a vocal opponent
of the TIF, said he will offer his support to the Spurs should they
seek alternate financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll go out and tell people how important the Spurs are to San
Antonio,'' Bennett said. ``I just don't think education dollars
should be spent for an arena.''
</P>
<P>
   The school board voted Monday after time was allotted for imput
by the Spurs, the City of San Antonio and the school district.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs' financial consulting firm, Paine Webber Inc., has
estimated the arena will cost between $369 million and $519 million
after interest on the bonds issued to finance it is taken into
account.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Moak, a former Texas deputy commissioner of education hired
by the Spurs and Bitterblue Inc., the project's developer,
predicted the school district would lose no revenue and might gain
$7 million over 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Wess Robinson, the school district's superintendent for business
and technology, gave a presentation along with consultants hired by
the district. They concluded the school district would lose $18.5
million, or perhaps a lot more, over 25 years if it joins the
project.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was attended by an estimated 300 people, 50 of whom
signed up to speak to the board, but about half of them left before
trustees began listening to the public imput at 11:30 p.m. Those
who remained were evenly divided among supporters and critics.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NORWICH, N.Y. _ Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., kept his
breakfast date with the Chenango County Chamber of Commerce Tuesday
morning, but he spent only a few minutes on the scheduled subject
of worker training.
</P>
<P>
   One of the last holdouts in the House who has not announced a
position on impeachment, Boehlert told the gathering, about 75
people at Fred's Inn, that he was hoping for some last-minute
action, giving him middle ground to plant his feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are asking me, `Aren't you under a lot of pressure?'''
Boehlert said. ``Yes, I am. It's not pressure from the White House,
promising me something. It's not pressure from the leadership,
threatening. It's pressure from within.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in the Mohawk River Valley, where everyone calls him
Sherry, Boehlert faces little political pressure. He won election
to his ninth term in November with 81 percent of the vote,
defeating a Right to Life candidate; the Democrats did not even
enter the race.
</P>
<P>
   One of the leading environmentalists in the Republican Party,
Boehlert has built a bridge between liberals in the 19th-century
industrial towns of Utica and Rome and the conservatives who
dominate the rural stretches around them.
</P>
<P>
   Despite casting unpopular votes, he has managed to stay
immensely popular by remembering people's names and bringing
federal money home. At 62, he is comfortable in his job, facing no
apparent threat.
</P>
<P>
   And as a sometime maverick moderate from a region of nine rural
counties that fill most of the triangle formed by Albany, Syracuse
and Binghamton, Boehlert also has no realistic ambitions for higher
office or for a position in the House leadership.
</P>
<P>
   So he has little to lose. Yet after a lifetime of public service
_ in the Army, as an aide to two congressional predecessors and as
Oneida County executive before his election to the House in 1982 _
Boehlert feels the pressure of history. He said he was worried that
his work for the environment, and his opposition to gun control,
would be overshadowed by one ``yea'' or ``nay.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of my record,'' he said at the breakfast. ``I'm
saddened by the fact that my legacy might well be, `How did he vote
on the impeachment question?'''
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress like to say they make decisions based on the
facts rather than sticking their fingers in the wind, but here in
New York's 23rd Congressional District, public opinion is not much
help. Calls to district headquarters in Utica since Thursday have
been almost evenly split: 1,502 for impeachment and 1,323 against,
as of 4:30 p.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who disagree with Boehlert's decisions _ his
controversial vote, for example, for Clinton's 1993 budget, or
against the ban on the procedure opponents call partial-birth
abortion _ say they respect him and trust his deliberations. And,
as a practical matter, they appreciate the perquisites that come
with his seniority, like the money he got for his district in last
year's transportation bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sherry is so comfortably entrenched, and I mean that in a very
positive sense, one vote is not going to hurt him,'' said John
Zogby, a national pollster who is based in Utica and has worked for
candidates in both parties. ``He has very good political skills.
And he doesn't thumb his nose at any group.''
</P>
<P>
   Boehlert collects contributions from abortion-rights activists
and unions as well as from banks and business groups. And he has
sometimes abandoned his party on controversial votes _ for the
Brady Bill and the minimum wage increase, for instance _ yet enjoys
a good relationship with Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Boehlert has spent the recent days, weeks and months listening
more than talking. He listened to Shaw Dallal, a retired
businessman who has contributed to Boehlert's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not condone what Clinton has done,'' Dallal said in an
interview, ``but I think that the way the Republicans have gone
over this is unconscionable.''
</P>
<P>
   Another opinion came from Michael Evans, a financial adviser who
has worked in Boehlert's campaigns. ``He is a dishonorable man,''
Evans said of Clinton. ``He doesn't deserve to sit in the highest
office.''
</P>
<P>
   At Boehlert's parish, St. John the Evangelist Catholic Church in
New Hartford, churchgoers said a prayer on Sunday for him and his
colleagues in Congress to have the virtues of wisdom and courage.
</P>
<P>
   The most helpful sounding board, Boehlert said, is his wife,
Marianne, who plays devil's advocate to him.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, and a bit on Tuesday, he answered some of the
thousands of telephone calls streaming into his offices. Between
conference calls with members of the Tuesday Group, moderate
Republicans still trying to arrange a compromise for censuring
Clinton, there was not much else to do. And the staff was swamped.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phones have been ringing and ringing,'' Janet Parilla, a
volunteer, told one caller.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what: You deliver the pizza and I'll put in your
opinion,'' Ms. Parilla said after ordering lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Then she hung up, and asked, ``Does anyone want to know my
opinion?''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ To appreciate the wrenching choice Rep. Sue
Kelly faced before deciding Tuesday to support impeachment of
President Clinton, it helped to listen to the moral ferocity with
which constituents like Eva Coots, John Piccoli and John Farrell
made their feelings known.
</P>
<P>
   As a girl growing up in Nazi Germany, Mrs. Coots saw firsthand
the folly of not taking a political groundswell seriously. So Mrs.
Coots, a 76-year-old retired nurse, convinced that all Clinton did
was tell a ``a stupid lie,'' drove from Ossining to Mrs. Kelly's
Mount Kisco office to voice her view that the ``ridiculous''
impeachment bandwagon must be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought Hitler would disappear because it seemed so
absurd,'' she said, standing in a windbreaker and sneakers in Mrs.
Kelly's district office. ``We should not expect that the Senate
will go around impeachment and it will go away. Nothing goes away
after so much effort is used to stir it up.''
</P>
<P>
   But then Mrs. Kelly was also being tugged _ and threatened _
from the pro-impeachment side by Farrell, a retired mathematics
teacher, and Piccoli, a retired police officer, both of whom also
felt strongly enough to visit her district office.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I, as a police officer, was before the grand jury and lied,
I'd be put in jail,'' Piccoli said.
</P>
<P>
   And Farrell fairly thundered to a young Kelly aide: ``If Mrs.
Kelly votes against impeachment, I will never vote for her again in
my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately the visits and telephone calls that her aides
registered meticulously on yellow legal pads came down to a wash.
So Mrs. Kelly had to fall back on other factors, her aides and
Republican district leaders said, in deciding to support
impeachment: her own philosophical views, an assessment of the
evidence against the president and the reality that opposition to
impeachment would be bucking practically the entire corps of
congressional Republicans, particularly the leadership that
determines her committee assignments, the fate of pet bills and
district allocations.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Tuesday ending the mystery about her view, Mrs.
Kelly said she based her decision to vote for impeachment on the
fact that the United States is a country of law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton is not the first president who lied to the American
people,'' she said. ``He is the first in modern times to perjure
himself in front of a grand jury. He lied not to protect the safety
of American soldiers, to save the Republic nor to trick a foreign
despot in a game of political poker. He lied to thwart a court
proceeding in a sad attempt to conceal. He broke his oath of
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``A CEO in my district would be fired for this; an attorney in
my district would face disbarment; a member of my staff
dismissed,'' she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mrs. Kelly, 62, represents a patchwork district that embraces
contrasting symbols like West Point, the dairy farms of Dutchess
County and the gleaming headquarters of IBM. It takes in the
estates of Bedford, but also the mean streets of Poughkeepsie. Gov.
George Pataki lives in her district.
</P>
<P>
   She also is pulled on by strong abortion rights advocates and
conservative Catholics who dislike her support for the right to
abortion and the Hudson Valley's army of environmentalists, who
laced into her during her first term for caving into the Republican
leadership on issues like clean water. It is a historically
Republican area, but one that gave Clinton 48 percent of its vote
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the district's motley profile, Mrs. Kelly has
never had a free ride. She was elected in 1994 after winning the
Republican primary as the lone woman in a field with half a dozen
men; in 1996 she beat off a vigorous primary challenge from Joseph
DioGuardi, a former congressman. She won a third term in November.
</P>
<P>
   As a relative newcomer, Mrs. Kelly, who before heading to
Washington was a real estate broker, is more vulnerable to
retribution from Republican leaders. She has counted on those
leaders for support in the past and has received fund-raising
visits from Speaker Newt Gingrich.

 &HT;    Hispanic group pushes for correct census count
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Kurylo
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Hispanic leaders will have to convince distrustful
immigrants that the census is confidential and relevant to their
future if they hope to avoid an undercount in 2000, the head of a
national Mexican civil rights organization said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make sure this community is counted,'' said Antonia
Hernandez, president and general counsel of the Mexican American
Legal Defense and Educational Fund, based in Los Angeles. ``They
are the ones who stand to lose the most if they are not counted.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, more than 1.5 million Latinos were not counted
nationwide, MALDEF says, resulting in the loss of millions in
federal funds to the cities where they live. Census figures are
used to determine how federal money is spent on housing, health
care, education and transportation. The information also is used to
determine how many seats each state will have in the U.S. House of
Representatives. The 2000 census is especially important for
Latinos because they are projected to become the nation's biggest
minority group shortly after the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez said her group will open a Southeast regional office
in Atlanta by February in an effort to get every Latino to fill out
a census form. MALDEF is working with officials from the local
Latin American Association.
</P>
<P>
   When it was considering where to open a southeastern office,
MALDEF picked Atlanta over Miami and Orlando because the Hispanic
community here is cohesive and well-organized, Hernandez said.
``The community leaders here work well together. We were really
impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   MALDEF will launch a national advertising campaign to convince
Latinos that the census is confidential and important to the future
of their children, Hernandez said. The ads will run in Spanish and
English on TV, radio and newspapers that cater to Hispanics. Many
ads will run during Spanish soap operas, which have a large
audience, she said. MALDEF also is asking utility companies, banks
and private businesses like Blockbuster and Wal-Mart to include
census information in shopping bags and on billing statements. The
campaign slogan is ``Make Yourself Count!'' Immigrants
traditionally have been undercounted because they do not trust the
government and they think the information may be used against them.
Hernandez acknowledged that it will be difficult to get immigrants,
especially undocumented ones, to fill out census forms.
</P>
<P>
   She stressed that the census forms are confidential and the
information is not shared with any agency, including the INS or the
IRS.
</P>
<P>
   The method used to count people still is in question. The
Clinton administration plans to use a scientific method of
estimating portions of the population, called statistical sampling,
to take account of the millions who might be missed in a
traditional headcount.
</P>
<P>
   But the Supreme Court is considering two cases by opponents who
say a statistical sampling is illegal, prone to political
manipulation and not necessarily more accurate than a traditional
head count.

 Japanese-American Museum Is Expanded  
 The Peninsula Hotel: A Touch of Hong Kong  
 Signing Up for Camping In the National Parks  
 Christmas in the Home of the Reindeer   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A pavilion opening next month at the Japanese American National
Museum in Los Angeles will feature galleries and a library where
visitors will have computer access to photographs and documents.
The addition triples the amount of exhibition space at the museum,
which is in the Little Tokyo Historic District downtown. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The pavilion will open Jan. 23 with the exhibition ``Common
Ground: The Heart of Community,'' which traces the
Japanese-American community in the United States over the past 130
years. Using artifacts, letters and film, the show will describe
Japanese-American pioneers of the 19th century, the internment of
Japanese-Americans during World War II and the adoption of Western
traditions by Japanese immigrants in America. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Admission is $6, $5 for seniors and $4 for students and children
over 5. Information: (213) 625-0414. &QL;

   Visitors to the Peninsula New York who crave a sense of the
hotel's former Beaux-Arts trappings can gaze up at the lobby's
magnificent wedding cake ceiling. But not much else from the past
is on view at the 23-story hotel, which closed for renovations in
January and reopened quietly last month.
</P>
<P>
   The lobby, lined with marble floors and Oriental carpets, is
still grand. But with paintings by Helen Frankenthaler and Robert
Motherwell and a new palette of creams, blacks and pale golds, the
hotel has become more contemporary.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 years as part of the Peninsula Group, the building that
started life in 1905 as the Gotham Hotel on 55th Street just west
of Fifth Avenue bears a striking resemblance to the Peninsula Hong
Kong, provided you don't look out the windows. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Furnishings in the 241 rooms are traditional, with silk
bedspreads, classic French furniture and the handsome Art Nouveau
headboards retained from the previous decor. But the electronic
system is high tech, from the mood lighting to the bedside panels
that regulate the lighting, air conditioning, Do Not Disturb light,
and television and stereo system. Larger rooms have an upholstered
luggage shelf, like those in the Hong Kong Peninsula. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic difference is in the bathrooms, which feature
hand-free telephones, stereo speakers and, in the larger rooms,
separate stall showers and bathtubs, with built-in
remote-controlled television for viewing from the tub.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the 48 simplest rooms, which cost $535 a night,
have more conventional combination showers and tubs. But these,
too, are larger than most in the hotel's pre-renovation days. And
all guests can use the hotel's rooftop spa and pool.

   For Christmas enthusiasts who wish the holiday didn't come but
once a year, Santapark, a Christmas-themed amusement center that
opened last month on the Arctic Circle in Finland offers jingle
bells no matter what the season. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About 500 miles north of Helsinki, outside the town of
Rovaniemi, the unofficial capital of Finnish Lapland, Santapark is
housed in a huge manmade cavern in a hill known as Syvasenvaara
Fell. The $8 million attraction is owned by a group of investors
that includes Finnair. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Visitors enter Santapark by walking through a 650-foot
passageway connecting the outside entrance with a plaza _ 36 feet
high and 108 feet across _ at the heart of the cavern. From there,
four corridors lead to a 56-foot circular hall that surrounds the
plaza. Together, the hall and plaza can handle up to 1,000 visitors
at once. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The hall and plaza contain half a dozen rides and attractions,
including a carousel and a multimedia show that traces the story of
Santa Claus. A Magic Sleigh Ride takes visitors through the far
northern landscape and its seasonal changes, from the deep snows
and dark days of winter to the sunny nights of midsummer.
</P>
<P>
   Santa makes appearances, accompanied by elves and reindeer.
There are also a puppet theater, games, a cafeteria and a gift
shop. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Santapark is open year round. Single tickets are $18.50 and
$12.75 for children ages 4 to 11. Information: (358-16) 333-0000,
fax (358-16) 333-0020.
</P>
<P>
   For a high-tech approach to a letter to Santa, the e-mail
address is santapark(AT)santapark.com. &QL;

FROM ARNIE TO `ALLY,` CAPTURING THE INSECURE HUMAN CONDITION  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 20) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jerry Seinfeld put it as well as anybody. ``I mean,'' he said of
David E. Kelley, ``this guy has done actual things.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley may be this decade's dean of the quality series, but when
the Museum of Television and Radio in Los Angeles honored him and
Seinfeld on the same night two months ago, the speakers seemed to
have trouble describing the essence of the Kelley genius as writer
and producer.
</P>
<P>
   Dylan McDermott, of Kelley's ABC law series, ``The Practice,''
used the words ``quirky, idiosyncratic,'' because somebody had to.
Calista Flockhart, of Kelley's Fox law series, ``Ally McBeal,''
went for the sentimental, describing Kelley as one who ``tells us
what it's like to be people.'' Tom Skerritt, who starred in
Kelley's CBS drama ``Picket Fences,'' referred to ``outrageous
subplots.''
</P>
<P>
   Then a deluge of Kelley television clips began: Roxanne and
Arnie, a bit underdressed, crashing through the ceiling in ``L.A.
Law.'' The hated Rosalind, on the same series, stepping blithely
into an empty elevator shaft. Sheriff Jimmy Brock, on ``Picket
Fences,'' catching his teen-age daughter in bed with a boyfriend.
Lawyers screaming like schoolgirls at the sight of a mouse on ``The
Practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Dignity is one of the first things to go when a character enters
Kelley's fictional world, but his take on life is a little more
complicated than that. A viewing of two dozen or so episodes of his
shows establishes that the characters he creates deal with
embarrassment, vulnerability, emotional neediness, public
misbehavior, the ludicrous and sometimes the grotesque more often
than the average American.
</P>
<P>
   But they also struggle with painful ethical questions and
loyalties and sometimes surprise themselves by doing the right
thing. Kelley, 42, is known as the most prolific writer in
television, but what his scripts convey to a nation of network
viewers about the human condition is probably more important than
the fact that he writes them in longhand on yellow legal pads in
record time.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley's words are intelligent, of course. He deals in real
moral issues and the kinds of conflicting loyalties that are part
of every adult's life. As one episode of ``Picket Fences'' (the
first series Kelley created, as writer and producer, on his own)
asked, is it wrong to do a fetal-tissue transplant, even though you
don't approve of the practice, if it will save the life of a good
friend with Parkinson's disease?
</P>
<P>
   In the show a judge rules against the procedure and carries a
warrant to the hospital when the doctors defy his orders, but he
stops on his way out to tell the patient's wife that his prayers
are with her.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately the grabber in Kelley's teleplays may be the extreme
vulnerability of his characters _ and the fact that the wounds
aren't theoretical. Viewers get to see them make fools of
themselves. Bad things happen to beautiful people. If they make
love in a not completely private place, they get caught.
</P>
<P>
   If a speech or conversation is really important, they say
exactly the wrong thing. When they make confessions, the last
people in the world they'd want to overhear it do.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Ally McBeal,'' Kelley's highly publicized Fox series, the
beautiful blond lawyer Georgia (Courtney Thorne-Smith) shyly admits
to her husband, in the privacy of the show's infamous co-ed office
bathroom, that she has always considered herself ``the fairest one
of them all.'' Then her colleague Ally emerges from one of the
bathroom stalls, and everyone is horrified.
</P>
<P>
   The universal human fear of looking foolish or different may
also account for the appeal of Kelley's occasionally grotesque
imagery: a waiting room full of victims of a serial mutilator who
turn up at the sheriff's office and hold up identical hooks where
their hands used to be, or an entire family known as the Flying
Gianninis arriving at their lawyers' office in a convoy of
wheelchairs.
</P>
<P>
   You the viewer sometimes fear that people are staring at you?
Not compared with this. Or, more accurately, the message may be
that we're all fodder for others' derision, that it's part of the
deal of being human.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest example of Kelley's work in the library of the
Museum of Television and Radio in New York is a 1986 episode of
``L.A. Law'' that he wrote with Jacob Epstein and Marshall
Goldberg. The episode has its serious elements _ a capital
punishment case, the trial of a man with AIDS who helped his lover
die _ but it also includes a file-eating, unhousebroken dog in the
office and the battle of Arnie Becker's parents over which of them
he'll represent during the divorce.
</P>
<P>
   It's Arnie (Corbin Bernsen), the scummy but confident bachelor
lawyer, who gets a taste of real embarrassment. The day after a
bout of impotence, which has him feeling depressed enough, his
beautiful bed partner forgives him by saying, at Arnie's office,
within earshot of co-workers, ``I'm sure you're very adequate when
you're not so distracted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Full Marital Jacket,'' a 1988 episode of ``L.A. Law'' written
by Kelley and Terry Louise Fisher, contains both serious and silly
embarrassments. Benny (Larry Drake), the mentally retarded office
employee, has been wrongfully charged with sexual misconduct. Abby
(Michele Greene) is being wooed by a human cannonball.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart and Ann (Michael Tucker and Jill Eikenberry) are getting
married, but Ann is standing around in her wedding gown with hot
rollers in her hair, refusing to start the ceremony until she gets
more height. The bride and groom are so annoyed with each other by
the time they reach the altar that they both snap ``Fine!'' instead
of ``I do.'' But then Ann says: ``I love you so much, Stuart. Let's
not screw it up, O.K.?'' ``Deal,'' he answers. Viewers have heard
worse updates of the marriage vows.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to forget that Kelley's next accomplishment was a
sitcom, ``Doogie Howser, M.D.,'' about a 16-year-old doctor who
looked 12. Kelley and Steven Bochco, his ``L.A. Law'' mentor,
created the series in 1989, and its title character got started on
potentially humiliating misunderstandings right away.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the premiere episode, an attractive fortyish woman asks
Doogie (Neil Patrick Harris), a boy genius who graduated from
Princeton at age 10, to father her child. Doogie, a virgin, can't
believe his luck and talks to his best friend at length about the
prospect of repeated lovemaking to achieve the goal. But, as it
turns out, the woman has artificial insemination in mind. Viewers
learn this, but Doogie never does.
</P>
<P>
   (Maybe the writers didn't think a teen-ager could handle the
kind of mortification that Kelley's adult characters regularly
endure.) Instead Doogie ponders the matter and wisely declines the
offer.
</P>
<P>
   Preternaturally mature teen-agers are a Kelley phenomenon, all
the better to make the grown-ups feel foolish. In ``Picket
Fences,'' a teen-ager questioned about her sexual experience, if
any, tells her father: ``I'm your daughter. I'm a product of your
influence. Now whether that's a source of fear or comfort to you,
you'll have to decide.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Picket Fences,'' which had its premiere in 1992, revolved
around a small-town husband and wife team _ a sheriff (Tom
Skerritt) and a doctor (Kathy Baker) _ who had their share of
embarrassing moments. They seemed basically sane but were
surrounded by a certain amount of peculiarity: A little girl brings
a severed human hand in a jar to show-and-tell.
</P>
<P>
   A little boy goes to bed in his hockey mask and uniform with his
parents' permission. A young man attempts an armed robbery, with an
Uzi, in the confessional. A judge announces, ``I hate the federal
government'' and nobody in the courtroom bats an eye.
</P>
<P>
   The only Kelley series with a married couple as protagonists,
``Picket Fences'' also celebrated family and commitment. In the
Parkinson's disease episode, Jimmy (Skerritt) catches Jill (Ms.
Baker) kissing an old boyfriend (Jamey Sheridan). They work things
out, but the incident scares them both. ``No matter how strong we
get, it stays fragile,'' says Jimmy. ``It always stays so
fragile.''
</P>
<P>
   In the final scene, Sheridan's character, alone and lonely,
listens to the happy sounds of Jill, Jimmy and their children
having a picnic. This was in 1993, the year Kelley married Michelle
Pfeiffer.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, Kelley created ``Chicago Hope,'' complete
with a singing surgeon (Mandy Patinkin) and a story about Siamese
twins in the first episode. He cut back his work on the show after
two seasons, but his influence seems to live on, at least in terms
of overt quirkiness.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Dr. Lisa Catera, a character named for a play on words
in a Cadillac commercial, and episodes involving a little-boy lama,
freeze-dried cats, a 52-year-old woman going into labor during a
Mediterranean Thanksgiving and a live bird loose in the operating
room. Oh, and Christine Lahti's character, Dr. Kate Austin, has
decided to become an astronaut.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley is still dealing in questions of insecurity, failure and
embarrassment in his two current series, both set in Boston law
firms. On ``The Practice,'' which won the Emmy Award for best drama
series this year, Ellenor (Camryn Manheim) questions Helen (Lara
Flynn Boyle), a district attorney, on the stand about a private
conversation. Ellenor's boss, Bobby (Dylan McDermott), is furious _
because the firm's relationship with the D.A.'s office is more
important than any one case. The testimony wins the case for
Ellenor, but it leads to a lawsuit against the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jimmy (Michael Badalucco) is worried that Bobby
really wants Lindsay (Kelli Williams) to do the closing argument,
because he likes her better. But Lindsay is devastated and guilty
because she defended a beloved former law professor on trial for
murder and lost. Even though she let the professor's wife lie on
the witness stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ally McBeal'' may continue to garner more attention for the
title character's short skirts and the actress's eating habits than
for its subject matter or messages, but at heart, ``Ally'' is the
quintessential Kelley hero.
</P>
<P>
   She is the most vulnerable, insecure lawyer in the world. She's
clumsy (last Christmas she knocked over the tree while attached to
it). She often says the wrong thing (speaking at a funeral: ``The
thing about funerals, the guest of honor is always dead'').
</P>
<P>
   She still isn't over a love affair that ended when she was in
college, and everyone she works with (including the old boyfriend,
now married) knows it. First, let's humiliate all the lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   But Kelley hasn't lost his taste for the deliberately bizarre.
Ally has dancing-baby hallucinations to remind her of her
biological clock; she once did the makeup of a transvestite
prostitute's corpse; she attended a funeral where Randy Newman's
``Short People'' was sung. And on ``The Practice,'' one of
Ellenor's recent clients was a mild-mannered guy who woke up one
morning after a one-night stand at a motel to find his sex
partner's head in his medical bag.

LISTEN WITH THE EAR, NOT THE MIND  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 20) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Present an unfamiliar piece of music to a randomly chosen
audience member, ask an opinion, and I challenge you to get a
simple expository sentence in response. The body language will be
one of retreat; the words will be quick to equivocate. ``That was
interesting,'' or ``I didn't understand it, but maybe I will next
time,'' or ``I should know more about it before I tell you what I
think.''
</P>
<P>
   One longs to hear, ``That was beautiful,'' or ``I hated it,'' or
``It bored me to death,'' for this is what those answers really
mean. The crucial word here is ``understand,'' for the fear of not
understanding is great. Failing to understand marks the unhappy
listener as dense, out of the loop, ill educated.
</P>
<P>
   One of the major achievements of 20th-century composition has
been the intimidation of listeners. The same concertgoer will be
reminded of history's rabble: the insensitive contemporary
audiences that persecuted or ignored great composers during their
lives, only to find themselves demonized by victorious posterity.
</P>
<P>
   Music lovers play a kind of futures market; commitment is scary
when next year's prices might go up or down. To put it another way,
sneering at old rabble is a risk when you yourself might be new
rabble in the making.
</P>
<P>
   Yet I wonder whether we understand music any more than we
understand something that grows in the ground. We look hard at
wisteria, and we like it or we don't. It is the same with Milton
Babbitt and company, who can cite the modern listener's lack of
culture all they want.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the more you stand in front of wisteria, the more roots
and tendrils you notice. But ``understanding wisteria'' implies
that one investigates it, and then judges according to the
findings. That process may work in the courtroom or the laboratory,
but when the senses and not the powers of induction preside, the
order is backward.
</P>
<P>
   In art, one decides what one likes, then finds out why. Knowing
more about trees may give more new details and new responses to
them, but the love is not in the knowing.
</P>
<P>
   My personal experience with ``understanding'' has been the music
of Schoenberg. An ardent admirer of ``Pierrot Lu-naire'' from
youth, I found most of his other music unpleasant. ``I don't
understand it,'' I told myself, while playing Schoenberg records at
breakfast or puzzling through the mysteries of retrograde
inversion. Now I know that I understand Schoenberg reasonably well;
I just don't like it.
</P>
<P>
   I don't like the density. The compositional resourcefulness is
unassailable, but so many ideas packed so close together make my
stomach queasy. Schoenberg's music emits a claustrophobia that
reminds me of Vienna, the city of his roots, and my home for too
many years. I can sort out the 12-tone techniques; I can follow the
counterpoint. But just as we meet immediately dislikable people or
animals _ sometimes even the youngest of children _ so I can hear
the qualities in Schoenberg's music and feel only fleeting
fondness.
</P>
<P>
   You can waste a lot of time and anguish on music you don't like.
As with other people interested in music, there is much that I
don't know or get, but the case of Schoenberg makes me distrust
those who tell me that their music is not beloved because the
public is illiterate and lazy, that its members are descendants of
the mob that drove poor Berlioz crazy.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that immediate esthetic judgment isn't dead
wrong some of the time, but at least it is real. It tells us that
the people out in the seats are alive. Sometimes further exposure
to something we hate the first time changes our mind. But may I
emphasize, sometimes. Posterity as redeemer is, like patriotism, a
last refuge of scoundrels.
</P>
<P>
   I don't suppose I liked Beethoven's last F major Quartet half as
well 40 years ago as I do now. On the other hand, the ``Grosse
Fuge,'' another late-Beethoven string-quartet piece, is as
impenetrable to me today as it was on first hearing.
</P>
<P>
   When patrons at the Metropolitan Opera boo, let your blood race.
Audiences have been browbeaten into a kind of esthetic terror, and
it is splendid to see them take a chance on themselves. Audiences
may be exasperating for coughing, whispering and foot-shuffling,
but given a little distance, one feels respect for them. Listeners
can be conned for a time, but with acquaintance (and not
necessarily new knowledge) they almost infallibly end up knowing
what is good and what isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Are audiences dumber today? They certainly have less first-hand
experience making music. Before the electronic age, people were
their own television sets, record players and radios. With fewer
opportunities to go to concerts or operas, domestic households
engaged in do-it-yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, or almost everyone from the lower middle class up,
played the piano or the violin a little. Beethoven and Haydn
symphonies were experienced in four-hand versions played in the
parlor.
</P>
<P>
   The proliferation of upright pianos into American homes was as
explosive at the turn of the century as that of the compact disk
and laptop computer are today. Just as every major American city
had at least two breweries, it had its piano manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the old catalogs of the French publisher Durand, and you
will find Debussy and Ravel arranged and rearranged for various
combinations of duet, trio or quartet. A familiarity with music
back then depended in large part on the listener's own facility at
one instrument or another, a phenomenon perhaps even more intense
prior to the 19th century, when music was (rightly) taught as a
corollary to mathematics.
</P>
<P>
   Today listeners are more passive. Listening to first-rate
performances of a vast repertory depends no longer on sight-reading
abilities but on the less demanding tasks of switch flipping and
dial twiddling. That is not to the good, and indeed, some blame the
faltering of the classical-music establishment on the quality of
its employees: well-intentioned people who collect records but have
no real connection with the problems of how music is made.
</P>
<P>
   Listeners today, on the other hand, are vastly better informed
than their counterparts of the past. The world's repertory is a
record bin away for any curious shopper. I doubt that the ardent
Viennese concertgoer of 1900 knew that Faure existed. Rachmaninoff
expressed surprise that Schubert had written piano sonatas.
</P>
<P>
   Read no diatribe against new music into all this. Schoenberg was
a genius. Elliott Carter is a brilliant and authoritative composer.
Babbitt is a fascinating geometrician. Think of the paragraphs
above as a modest bill of rights. Its first article guarantees
freedom from intimidation, and it is followed by such propositions
as the inviolability of the personal instinct and the limited power
of the intellect to make esthetic decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Open ears and curiosity are suggested, for there is much music
in our time to love. Learn, for knowing more can enrich judgments,
just as a frame and mat set off a picture we have been drawn to.
Don't ruin your breakfasts with guilt. Feel free to be offended; it
might be the best thing to happen to living composers in a long
time. Honest dislike loosens the limbs and limbers the spirit. From
chemistry like this comes true love as well.

A GOOD MAN TAKEN OVER BY AN IRISH GANGSTER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 20) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ Brendan Gleeson bears an uncanny resemblance
to Martin Cahill, the maverick Dublin gangland boss whom he plays
in John Boorman's new movie, ``The General,'' which opened Friday
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there was another, more subtle, reason for casting the burly
Irish actor as the mobster. In order to convey why Dubliners came
to admire this hardened criminal, murdered by the IRA in 1994,
Boorman needed a likable Cahill. And Gleeson is very likable. But
he also has what the veteran director calls ``essential goodness,''
which is why he almost turned down his biggest movie role to date.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know if I wanted to play him or not,'' the
43-year-old actor said softly, ``partly because he had been a real
person and there were people still grieving him, partly because he
had hurt people. I wondered, why wouldn't you go for the person who
was hurt and tell their story? I found Cahill intensely
interesting, but I didn't find him in any way laudable. Eventually
the script arrived and I did a screen test and it began to take
over, but I was still a bit worried that the fascination and charm
of it were going to blur my integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Gleeson's apprehension was understandable. Cahill carried out
innumerable crimes, big and small, and he cheerfully used bombs and
threats _ as well as refined low-life instincts _ to keep himself
out of jail during most of his long criminal career. Yet the
humorous way in which he challenged all expressions of authority,
from government and police to Roman Catholic Church and Irish
Republican Army, also appealed to the anarchic streak in a good
many Dubliners. Somehow, they identified him with Robin Hood.
</P>
<P>
   So, for Gleeson and Boorman, who based his screenplay on Paul
Williams' 1995 biography, ``The General, Godfather of Crime,'' the
challenge was to strike the right tone, not too dark, not too
romantic. In the view of many critics, they succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   Presented in black-and-white, ``The General'' won Boorman the
best director award at this year's Cannes International Film
Festival. When it was shown at this fall's New York Film Festival,
Janet Maslin in The New York Times said the movie showed the
65-year-old director ``in top form'' and Gleeson performing
``magnificently.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-hour film tracks Cahill from his childhood in a grim
postwar housing project (Eamonn Owens, the lead in Neil Jordan's
1997 movie, ``The Butcher Boy,'' plays him as a teen-age
delinquent) to his emergence as a gang leader nicknamed the General
with a talent for getting away with things. It also re-enacts
Cahill's most famous crimes: his armed robbery of $3 million worth
of gold and precious stones from O'Connors jewelers in Dublin and
his heist of 11 Old Master paintings, including Vermeer's
invaluable ``Lady Writing a Letter With Her Maid,'' from Sir Alfred
Beit's mansion, Russborough House, outside Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   As Cahill was put under 24-hour police surveillance, he became
known to Dubliners as a colorful rascal who would go to any lengths
to avoid being seen by the public. Eventually, in 1987, he allowed
himself to be interviewed on the street for a television
documentary, but he kept his hand over his face for more than an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, his eccentricities were the talk of town: he had numerous
children with both his wife, Frances (Maria Doyle Kennedy), and his
sister-in-law Tina (Angeline Ball); he was a teetotaler; he
disapproved of drug trafficking and he enjoyed breeding racer
pigeons. But his greatest hobby was outfoxing the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, Boorman has taken three senior Irish policemen
whom Cahill considered his nemeses and turned them into the
fictional Inspector Ned Kenny, played with an impeccable Dublin
accent by Jon Voight (who appeared in Boorman's 1972 movie,
``Deliverance''). It is Kenny _ ``beautifully embodied'' by Voight,
as Ms. Maslin put it _ who acts as the counterweight to Cahill, who
keeps reminding that, for all his charisma, the General is a
heartless criminal. And it is Kenny who can finally relax when the
IRA kills Cahill for playing footsie with the Loyalists.
</P>
<P>
   But while the film is about Cahill, it also aspires to say
something about Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of character is really an Irish archetype,'' said
Boorman, an Englishman who has lived here for the past 30 years.
``He is someone who rails against everything and sort of takes on
the world. I think it's partly because Ireland is a colonized
country, not only by the British but also by the Church, so there
is always repression and hypocrisy. But despite its being so
dominated by the Catholic Church, I have always felt that Ireland
is fundamentally pagan. And from time to time, characters like
Martin Cahill erupt from the unconscious to express those pagan
notions.''
</P>
<P>
   For Gleeson, Cahill was also a product of an Ireland that was
suddenly wrenched from its sleepy rural isolation and forced to
confront the problems of most urban societies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember going down to the country and no one locked their
doors,'' he said of childhood summers spent in Tipperary. ``Then,
in the 1970s, with the troubles in the North, guns came south and
society began to get violent and corrupt and we joined the rest of
the world. There was a split between Gaelic Ireland and the
disadvantaged urban poor of Dublin, who felt alienated. So when
Martin Cahill said they weren't going to get him, that's where it
came from: `They don't care about us, so why should we care about
them?' ''
</P>
<P>
   This was not the world of Gleeson's upbringing. Born into a
middle-class Dublin home, his father was a civil servant ``who
basically made sure there was money on the table.'' However, his
mother's love of theater, poetry, music and drawing proved
contagious and, at primary school, young Brendan was soon
performing in plays and concerts.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He had announced at an early age that he would become an actor
and he seemed on track. After leaving school at 18, he even tried
his hand as a street musician. Yet six years later, after acting in
numerous plays while majoring in English and Gaelic at University
College, Dublin, Gleeson turned away from his chosen career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the Abbey Theater and did a hideous audition,'' he
remembered, sitting in a hotel overlooking Malahide Estuary to the
north of Dublin. ``But I also didn't like the atmosphere. I
thought, if I have to make my living here, I'll grow bored. I just
didn't see myself as part of that world. I had no fear of the
stage. I just didn't think I could live with the hustling and being
ignored and rejected. I'd really like to know why I suffered from
such lack of ambition.''
</P>
<P>
   So instead Gleeson became a high school teacher, but he also
continued acting, notably in a company called The Passion Machine,
run by a fellow teacher, Paul Mercier. He also wrote and directed
plays and organized theater groups at his school. Then, after 10
years as a teacher, he found himself back where he had started _
wondering whether he should become a professional actor _ except
now he was 34.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had always said, I'll never reach 35 and regret,'' he
recalled, ``so I thought, why not? Let's go for it.''
</P>
<P>
   He immediately found work at the Abbey, but when he began
playing small roles in movies and on television, he made a painful
discovery: what seemed right on stage became frightful overacting
on the screen. A 10-week stint in a television soap opera gave him
a chance to learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those 10 weeks, I watched myself on national television
and it was just horrific,'' he said with a laugh. ``I learned in
front of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   But he evidently learned quickly, emerging in less than a decade
as one of Ireland's most popular actors. He was soon acclaimed at
home for his television role as Michael Collins in ``The Treaty,''
directed by Jonathan Lewis, and he was noticed abroad when he
played Hamish alongside Mel Gibson in ``Braveheart'' in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   After that, it was as if no Irish film could be made without him
_ among them, Jordan's ``Michael Collins,'' Gillies McKinnon's
``Trojan Eddie,'' ``The Butcher Boy'' and Paddy Breathnach's ``I
Went Down.'' One Dublin film critic even nicknamed him the Irish
Depardieu. In ``The General,'' though, the entire film revolves
around him.
</P>
<P>
   While looking for financing, Boorman ignored pressure to use a
better-known actor _ Gabriel Byrne and Gary Oldman were both
suggested _ yet it took Gleeson a while to get inside Martin
Cahill. He read Williams's biography, he studied the television
film of the gangster to capture his voice and gestures, and he
visited some gangland pubs, but Boorman was not satisfied with the
first screen test.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave a brilliant impersonation of Cahill, but it was only
an impersonation,'' the director recalled. ``I was disappointed and
he was too. It wasn't until the middle of rehearsals, when he was
working with Jon Voight, that it happened. Suddenly he got inside
the character and from that moment he could hardly put a foot
wrong. He was extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Halfway through shooting the film, one of Cahill's sisters
arrived at the set and asked to see Gleeson.
</P>
<P>
   `She'd heard I looked really like him and she was dying to see
him,'' the actor said. ``She said, `No, you're fair, he was kind of
brown.' But it was touching. She just wanted to see him. We chatted
for 45 minutes. She said he'd have loved all the corruption
scandals involving politicians. She also confirmed lots of things.
She said he knew he'd be killed. And he knew there'd be a movie
about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Three, as it happens, so far. The BBC has made a television
version, ``Cast a Cold Eye,'' starring Ken Stott, which has still
to be broadcast. And Kevin Spacey is starring in another film
inspired by Cahill, ``Ordinary Decent Criminal,'' directed by
Thaddeus O'Sullivan, which is currently being filmed in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   By now, of course, Gleeson has moved on. He played a sweet
simpleton in Stephen Bradley's still-to-be-released film, ``Sweety
Barrett.'' And he has just completed location work in Vancouver on
a film called ``Lake Placid,'' directed by Steve Miner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't keep appearing in every Irish movie,'' he said. ``I've
made a little mental note to myself saying it's time I had the
confidence to feel I have something to offer. That's why I did
`Lake Placid.' It's one of four lead roles and I play an American
sheriff.'' He smiled to himself and added: ``I hope that will
release me from being the token Irishman.''

CHEVRON TO CUT CAPITAL SPENDING AND JOBS
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joining the list of major oil companies that are retrenching in
the face of low crude oil prices, Chevron Corp. announced cuts
Tuesday in both capital spending and employment, primarily in North
America.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Derr, the chairman of the company, which is based in San
Francisco, told an analysts' meeting in New York that the goal was
to reduce costs by $500 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In what has become a familiar oil company response to persistent
low prices, Derr said that cuts in capital spending of 8 percent,
to $5.1 billion next year, would come mostly in the company's older
exploration and production, refining and marketing and chemical
businesses in North America.
</P>
<P>
   He said that significant spending would continue in its
promising long- term prospects in Kazakhstan, West Africa and the
Gulf of Mexico, where the company has been able to increase its
production of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
   Derr added that the company would spend about $2.6 billion on
exploration and production outside the United States and $1.1
billion within the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The overall reductions in its work force of 34,000 would be
modest, he said, because of the overseas growth. Mike Libbey, the
manager of media relations, said some employees who faced layoffs
would be given an opportunity to train for jobs in expanding parts
of the company, primarily in overseas exploration.
</P>
<P>
   The Chevron announcement followed a major revamping announced by
the Royal Dutch/Shell Group in London on Monday. It said it would
sell 40 percent of its chemical business, cut staff and take
charges of $4.5 billion in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month Exxon and Mobil, which agreed to merge,
announced they would cut costs by $2.8 billion a year and reduce
employment by about 9,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   There was speculation early last week that Chevron and Royal
Dutch would merge, fed by rumors on the Internet. Derr said Tuesday
that ``we will consider mergers or acquisitions as one possible way
to improve business results, but it is not necessary for Chevron to
merge with a competitor to continue to provide top returns to our
shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We have the financial strength to deal with low oil
prices, poor economic conditions in Asia and other financial
challenges over the next few years.''
</P>
<P>
   With crude about 40 percent lower than a year ago, the oil
companies see little prospect of a recovery, although the January
crude oil contract rose 26 cents, to $11.55 a barrel on the New
York Mercantile Exchange on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   There was some hope that a meeting Thursday among three of the
world's largest producers, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico,
could lead to another round of cuts in crude oil production.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, those three countries initiated a round of cuts
that was joined by other major producers including members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which cut the daily
world supply of 74 million barrels by about 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It had been difficult, however, to agree to further cuts since
the low crude oil prices have severely reduced the producing
countries' revenue. Most are reluctant to cut further, fearing that
other countries would eat into their market share by not abiding by
the lower production levels.
</P>
<P>
   Thus most oil companies, having gone through years of
retrenchment, are preparing for a long period of low crude oil
prices with another round of cost cutting.
</P>
<P>
   The company's work force has fallen to the current 34,000 from
54,000 in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron's stock fell $2.6875, to $83 a share Tuesday in
composite New York Stock Exchange trading.

   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from the introduction to the
House Judiciary Committee's report on the resolution to impeach
President William Jefferson Clinton for high crimes and
misdemeanors and the Democrats' dissent, as provided by
Congressional aides:
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Statement
</P>
<P>
   ``Equal Justice Under Law'' _ That principle so embodies the
American constitutional order that we have carved it in stone on
the front of our Supreme Court. The carving shines like a beacon
from the highest sanctum of the judicial branch across the Capitol,
the home of the legislative branch, and down Pennsylvania Avenue to
the White House, the home of the executive branch. It illuminates
our national life and reminds those other branches that despite the
tumbling tides of politics, ours is a Government of laws and not of
men. It was the inspired vision of our founders and framers that
the judicial, legislative, and executive branches would work
together to preserve the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Equal Justice Under Law'' amounts to much more than a
stone carving. Although we cannot see or hear it, this living,
breathing force has real consequences in the lives of average
citizens every day. Ultimately, it protects us from the knock on
the door in the middle of the night. More commonly it allows us to
claim the assistance of the Government when someone has wronged us
_ even if that person is stronger or wealthier or more popular than
we are. In America, unlike other countries, when the average
citizen sues the chief executive of our nation, they stand equal
before the bar of justice. The Constitution requires the judicial
branch of our Government to apply the law equally to both. That is
the living consequence of ``Equal Justice Under Law.''
</P>
<P>
   The President of the United States must work with the judicial
and legislative branches to sustain that force. The temporary
trustee of that office, William Jefferson Clinton, worked to defeat
it. When he stood before the bar of justice, he acted without
authority to award himself the special privileges of lying and
obstructing to gain an advantage in a Federal civil rights action
in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Arkansas, in a Federal grand jury investigation in the United
States District Court for the District of Columbia, and in an
impeachment inquiry in the United States House of Representatives.
His resistance brings us to this most unfortunate juncture.
</P>
<P>
   So ``Equal Justice Under Law'' lies at the heart of this matter.
It rests on three essential pillars: an impartial judiciary, an
ethical bar and a sacred oath. If litigants profane the sanctity of
the oath, ``Equal Justice Under Law'' loses its protective force.
Against that backdrop, consider the actions of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   On May 27, 1997, the nine Justices of the Supreme Court of the
United States unanimously ruled that Paula Corbin Jones could
pursue her Federal civil rights actions against William Jefferson
Clinton. Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.S. 681 (1997). On Dec. 11, 1997,
United States District Judge Susan Webber Wright ordered President
Clinton to provide Ms. Jones with answers to certain routine
questions relevant to the lawsuit. Acting under the authority of
these court orders, Ms. Jones exercised her rights _ rights that
every litigant has under our system of justice. She sought answers
from President Clinton to help her prove her case against him _
just as President Clinton sought and received answers from her.
President Clinton used numerous means to prevent her from getting
truthful answers.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 17, 1997, he encouraged a witness, whose truthful
testimony would have helped Ms. Jones to file a false affidavit in
the case and to testify falsely if she were called to testify in
the case. On Dec. 23, 1998, he provided, under oath, false written
answers to Ms. Jones's questions. On Dec. 28, 1997, he began an
effort to get the witness to conceal evidence that would have
helped Ms. Jones. Throughout this period, he intensified efforts to
provide the witness with help in getting a job to insure that she
carried out his designs.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 17, 1998, President Clinton provided, under oath,
numerous false answers to Ms. Jones's questions during his
deposition. In the days immediately following the deposition, he
provided a false and misleading account to another witness, Betty
Currie, in hopes that she would substantiate the false testimony he
gave in the deposition. These actions denied Ms. Jones her rights
as a litigant, subverted the fundamental truth-seeking function of
the United States District Court for the Eastern District to
Arkansas, and violated President Clinton's constitutional oath ``to
preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United
States'' and his constitutional duty to ``take care that the laws
be faithfully executed.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning shortly after his deposition, President Clinton became
aware that a Federal grand jury empaneled by the United States
District Court for the District of Columbia was investigating his
actions before and during his civil deposition. President Clinton
made numerous false statements to potential grand jury witnesses in
hopes that they would repeat these statements to the grand jury. On
Aug. 17, 1998, President Clinton appeared before the grand jury by
video and, under oath, provided numerous false answers to the
questions asked. These actions impeded the grand jury's
investigation, subverted the fundamental truth-seeking function of
the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, and
violated President Clinton's constitutional oath to ``preserve,
protect and defend the Constitution of the United States'' and his
constitutional duty to  &UR; `` &LR; take care that the laws be faithfully
executed.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's actions then led to this inquiry. On Oct. 8,
1998, the United States House of Representatives passed House
Resolution 581 directing the Committee on the Judiciary to begin an
inquiry to determine whether President Clinton should be impeached.
As part of that inquiry, the committee sent written requests for
admission to him. On Nov. 27, 1998, President Clinton provided,
under oath, numerous false statements to this committee in response
to the requests for admission. These actions impeded the
committee's inquiry, subverted the fundamental truth-seeking
function of the United States House of Representatives in
exercising the sole power of impeachment, and violated President
Clinton's constitutional oath to ``preserve, protect, and defend
the Constitution of the United States'' and his constitutional duty
to ``take care that the laws be faithfully executed.''
</P>
<P>
   By these actions, President Clinton violated the sanctity of the
oath without which ``Equal Justice Under Law'' cannot survive.
Rather than work with the judicial and legislative branches to
uphold the rule of law, he directly attacked their fundamental
truth-seeking function. He has disgraced himself and the high
office he holds. His high crimes and misdemeanors undermine our
Constitution. They warrant his impeachment, his removal from office
and his disqualification from holding further office.

<P>
   The Democratic Statement
</P>
<P>
   For only the second time in the history of our nation, the House
is poised to impeach a sitting President. The Judiciary Committee
Democrats uniformly and resoundingly dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Fundamentally, Judiciary Democrats believe that the President's
conduct was wrongful in attempting to conceal an extramarital
affair. But we do not believe that the allegations that the
President violated criminal laws of the nation in attempting to
conceal that affair _ even if proven true _ amount to the abuse of
official power which is an immutable, historically rooted
prerequisite for impeaching a President, thereby decapitating the
executive branch and disenfranchising the electorate in its most
important and only collective decision. In short, we do not believe
that the nature of the misconduct is the mettle with which the
founding fathers intended impeachments to be made. And further, we
believe that the evidentiary foundation for the charges of criminal
misconduct by the President to be shaky, at best.
</P>
<P>
   Historian Arthur Schlesinger, appearing before the committee ...
echoed many of our views regarding the grave dangers of
dumbing-down the impeachment process for largely private misconduct
and has pointed out the dangers to the republic of turning the
political equivalent of capital punishment into a political weapon.
He said: ``[The) lowering the bar for impeachment creates a novel,
... revolutionary theory of impeachment, a theory that would send
us on an adventure with ominous implications for the separation of
powers that the Constitution established as the basis of our
political order. It would permanently weaken the Presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   As other constitutional scholars which came before the committee
during this process told us, impeachment is like a wall around the
fort of the separation of powers fundamental to our Constitution;
the crack we put in the wall today become the fissure of tomorrow,
and which ultimately leads to the wall crumbling down. This process
is that serious. It is so serious the wall was not even approached
when President Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus, nor
when President Roosevelt misled the public in the Lend-Lease
program, nor when there was evidence that Presidents Reagan and
Bush gave misleading evidence in the Iran-contra affair.
</P>
<P>
   We note at the outset our profound disagreement with the process
which the Judiciary Committee undertook to report this resolution.
Without any independent examination with fact witnesses, this
committee essentially rubber-stamped a Sept. 9 referral from the
Office of Independent Counsel (O.I.C.) whose lack of independence
and fairness is widely perceived throughout the land and by us. ...
That referral contained largely unproven allegations based on grand
jury testimony _ often inadmissable hearsay evidence _ which was
never subject to cross examination. Indeed the committee's
investigation of this material irresponsibly amounted to nothing
more than simply releasing to the public the referral and tens of
thousands of accompanying pages of often unreliable grand jury
material.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did such unprecedented releases represent a profound
lapse of fairness and due process generally afforded targets of
grand jury probes, it represented a profound lapse in judgement and
tact: its salacious and oftimes pornographic details of alleged
intimate contact was greeted with public outrage by America's
parents and others who decried the transformation of the Internet
into a vessel of smut.
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Democrats also decry the partisanship that accompanied
this sad three-month process at nearly every turn and point out
that unfortunate departure from the experience of Watergate in 1974
and the subsequent judicial impeachments which followed.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is no question that the President's actions were
wrong, and further that the President has suffered, perhaps
properly, profound and untold humiliation and pain for his actions.
But it is undeniable that, when asked squarely about his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky before the grand jury, the President
directly admitted to the improper affair. The core of the charges
against the President, thus, are that he did not adequately
describe the intimate details of the relationship, and that his
attempts to conceal his affair amounted to a conspiracy to violate
the criminal laws of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Our review of the evidence however convinces us of one thing:
there is little support for the suggestion that the President
obstructed justice, tampered with witnesses or abused the power of
his office. A few examples will make the point.
</P>
<P>
   The referral alleges that the President attempted to find Ms.
Lewinsky a job in order to buy her silence. But the evidence makes
clear that efforts to help Ms. Lewinsky find a job began in April
1996, long before she ever was identified as a witness in the Jones
case. Ms. Lewinsky herself testified that ``no one ever asked me to
lie and I was never promised a job for my silence.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, while the referral contends that the President tried
to hide gifts he had given Ms. Lewinsky, the evidence makes clear
that Ms. Lewinsky _ and not the President _ initiated the transfer
of those items to the President's secretary, Ms. Currie. Finally,
by alleging abuses of power by the President, the independent
counsel has simply re-packaged his basic allegation of lying about
sex in a transparent effort to conjure the ghost of Watergate.
Finally, President's statements under oath in the dismissed Paula
Jones case were legally immaterial to that case and would never
have formed the legal basis for any investigation, again raising
the specter that this investigation has been tainted with politics.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For more than 200 years, we have been guided by the brilliant
legacy of our founding fathers and of our Constitution, which,
generation after generation, helps us endure the difficult
political and social questions that face us. We are quite certain
that the drafters of that document would shake their heads in
puzzlement at both the process undertaken and product produced by
the committee.
</P>
<P>
   By now, we are all familiar with the constitutional standard for
impeachable offenses: ``treason, bribery, and other high crimes and
misdemeanors.'' George Mason, one of our founders, said that the
phrase ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' refers to Presidential
actions that are ``great and dangerous offenses'' or ``attempts to
subvert the Constitution.'' Alexander Hamilton, in The Federalist
No. 65, wrote that impeachable offenses ``relate chiefly to
injuries done immediately to society itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Two hundred years later, this committee was called upon to
consider the standard for impeachment of a President in 1974,
during Watergate. Our staff issued a report in February 1974 that
has become a model for scholars and historians. The report
concluded that impeachment is ``a constitutional remedy addressed
to serious offenses against the system of Government,'' and is
directed at ``constitutional wrongs that subvert the structure of
Government, or undermine the integrity of office and even the
Constitution itself.'' Those words are as true today as they were
back in 1974. An impeachment is only for a serious abuse of
official power or a serious breach of official duties.
</P>
<P>
   While Democrats were pleased that the Committee scheduled one
hearing on constitutional standards on Nov. 9 and allowed other
White House witnesses to testify on the matter, we are confounded
by failure to even articulate proper standards for Presidential
impeachment consistent with the committee position adopted by the
committee in 1974 during Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   As explained in greater detail in our staff report on the
constitutional standards for impeachment, committee Democrats do
not believe that the nature of the offenses alleged justify
impeaching the President and sending to the Senate this sordid
affair for a prolonged and protracted Senate trial, which will
divide the nation and produce untold harm to our civic discourse.
</P>
<P>
   In this context we also point out, parenthetically, that since
the election of President Clinton in 1992, that Congressional
Republicans and the independent counsel have spent tens of millions
of dollars of taxpayers monies on investigations into the President
_ investigations which have been discredited in the eyes of the
public. In doing so, Congressional Republicans have perverted the
powers of Congressional investigation into a political weapon,
setting a dangerous precedent for future generations.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, we note that there is virtual unanimity among Democrats
and Republicans that the Senate will not convict the President,
and, thus, that the House is merely using the extraordinary powers
of impeachment to express its displeasure for what the President
has done. We regard this use of the impeachment sword as a
perversion of the Constitutional form of government and as an
arrogation of power by the House Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment is only warranted for conduct that constitutes
``treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors'' as set
forth in Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution. As virtually
all constitutional scholars have noted, there is an important
distinction between criminal and impeachable offenses _ impeachment
serves to protect the nation, not to punish the wrongdoer. A review
of the language of the Constitution, the history and drafting of
the impeachment clause, and subsequent review of its usage all
serve to confirm that the remedy of impeachment should be reserved
for the most egregious abuses of Presidential authority, rather
than misconduct unrelated to public office. It is also clear that
the President is subject to civil and criminal punishment
independently of the impeachment process. The constitutional
process of impeachment should not, therefore, be used for punitive
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the majority have gone to great lengths to
misconstrue the power of impeachment as one that is appropriately
exercised against a chief executive based on any potentially
criminal conduct. This interpretation is flatly inconsistent with
the intentions of the framers and the prior Presidential
impeachments in this country. It also is contrary to the central
conclusions of the staff report produced by the Watergate
impeachment inquiry staff in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although many have inaptly compared the present proceedings to
the genuine constitutional crisis brought about by President
Richard Nixon, there are far more dissimilarities than parallels.
In using the powers granted by the Independent Counsel Act for the
first time to justify the submission of a report to Congress
outlining possible impeachable offenses, the O.I.C. departed from
the traditional deference shown by past Presidential prosecutors.
As these other prosecutors have recognized, it is Congress's
constitutional responsibility to determine whether alleged
misconduct by a chief executive constitutes grounds for
impeachment. Watergate independent prosecutor Leon Jaworski
submitted grand jury materials to Congress that consisted only of
grand jury transcripts and a ``road map'' through the allegations
being investigated by the grand jury. His report ``provided no
analysis and drew no conclusions.'' To this day, that document
remains sealed. Congress, in short, recognized that only it had the
right and the responsibility to level public charges of impeachable
offenses against the President.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's constitutional responsibility is quite distinct
from cataloging laws that may have been violated. The determination
of whether to impeach a President is vastly different than the
determination of whether there is evidence of a legal offense. The
majority, by invoking the language of criminal statutes to describe
the President's alleged misconduct, directly contradicts one of the
main conclusions of the Watergate staff report, which it purports
to endorse:
</P>
<P>
   ``The impeachment of a President must occur only for reasons at
least as pressing as those needs of Government which give rise to
the creation of criminal offenses. But this does not mean that the
various elements of proof, defenses and other substantive concepts
surrounding an indictable offense control the impeachment process.
Nor does it mean that state or Federal criminal codes are
necessarily the place to turn to provide a standard under the
United States Constitution. Impeachment is a constitutional remedy.
The framers intended that the impeachment language they employed
should reflect the grave misconduct that so injures or abuses our
constitutional institutions and form of Government as to justify
impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   The assumption that a President's violation of any of a number
of laws may trigger the impeachment provisions of Article II,
Section 4 of the Constitution is fundamentally misguided. ...
</P>
<P>
   It has been repeatedly argued that the House is like a grand
jury that simply votes out an article of impeachment based on
``probable cause'' to believe that impeachable offense have
occurred and lets the Senate weigh the actual evidence. This view
of the House's role has been offered in support of the proposition
that the House does not have to hear evidence or make decisions
about who is telling the truth because that is the Senate's job.
This cramped view of the appropriate role of the House finds no
support in the Constitution and is completely contrary to the great
weight of historical precedent.
</P>
<P>
   As former Watergate-era Attorney General Elliot Richardson
warned: ``A vote to impeach is a vote to remove. If members ...
believe that should be the outcome, they should vote to impeach. If
they think that is an excessive sentence, they should not vote to
impeach, because if they do ... the matter is out of your hands.''
</P>
<P>
   During the debate over the articles of impeachment, Rep. Frank
reminded the Members that they should not take the House's
independent role to remove the president from office lightly: ``I
have to say that I think it is a grave error constitutionally to
denigrate what we are doing. Yes, it is true that, as a consequence
of this, the President will not be instantly thrown out of office.
It is also true that the only justification and basis for this
proceeding and the only basis on which members can honestly vote
for these articles is the conviction that the President out to be
thrown out of office.''
</P>
<P>
   The argument that the House is merely the body that accuses and
the Senate is the body that tries, undermines the dual protection
against misuse of the impeachment power that the founders intended.
The Constitution requires more than that the House be a mere rubber
stamp for sending allegations of wrongdoing to the Senate; rather
Article II intends that the House as well as the Senate look to the
same evidence with the same standards. As constitutional expert,
Professor John H. Labovitz, concluded with respect to Watergate, in
terms that seem as if they were written for today:
</P>
<P>
   ``There were undesirable consequences if the House voted
impeachment on the basis of one-sided or incomplete information or
insufficiently persuasive evidence. Subjecting the Senate, the
President, and the nation to the uncertainty and potential
divisiveness of a Presidential impeachment trial is not a step to
be lightly undertaken. While the formal consequences of an
ill-advised impeachment would merely be acquittal after trial, the
political ramifications could me much more severe. Accordingly, the
House ... should not vote impeachments that are unlikely to succeed
in the Senate ... the standard of proof applied in the House should
reflect the standards of proof in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Labovitz has meticulously documented how, in the Nixon
inquiry, everyone agreed the majority, the minority, and the
President's counsel that the standard of proof for the Committee
and the House was ``clear and convincing evidence.'' When the
articles of impeachment are weighed against this standard, it is
clear that the constitutional standard has not been satisfied.

BRITISH COMPANY BUYING PUBLISHER OF MOTOR TREND, SNOWBOARDER
MAGAZINES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Petersen Companies Inc., publisher of Motor Trend, Hot Rod,
Guns &AMP; Ammo, Snowboarder, Inline and dozens of other magazines for
readers whose hormone of choice is testosterone and whose speed of
choice is zoom, is being purchased by a British magazine publisher,
Emap PLC, in a deal valued at $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Petersen, which has been one of the fastest-growing magazine
companies _ with a particular focus on the young male audience _
will continue its search for acquisitions as a division of Emap,
according to its current chairman and chief executive, James
Dunning Jr. This insures its continued rivalry with Primedia Inc.,
which has also been picking up niche magazines for young readers at
a fast clip.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, shortly after Petersen started faxing out the news of
its deal, Primedia followed suit with the news that it had acquired
Sterling/Macfadden Teen Network, publishers of Teen Beat, Tiger
Beat, Sixteen and Teen Machine, and the Laufer Publishing Co.,
publishers of BOP and BB (also known as Big Bopper). A company
spokesman said the purchase price was more than $35 million.
</P>
<P>
   William Reilly, Primedia's chairman and chief executive, said in
a prepared statement that Primedia's new stable, coupled with its
2.4-million-circulation magazine Seventeen, gave the company ``an
unmatched authority in the teen category across all ages.''
Primedia is controlled by Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts, a leveraged
buyout firm.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's deal gave Petersen's shareholders a different sort of
bragging right. Many of them doubled or even quadrupled their
investment. Under the Emap deal Petersen shareholders will receive
$34 a share in cash. Last year, Petersen sold 8 million of its 32.5
million shares outstanding to the public for slightly more than
$17.50 a share.
</P>
<P>
   The deal meant that a company purchased in 1996 for $165 million
in equity and $300 million in assumed debt, then recapitalized with
its $141 million public offering in 1997, is passing on the debt to
the new owners while getting $1.2 billion in equity. Willis Stein &AMP;
Partners LP, a Chicago-based private equity firm, is Petersen's
largest single shareholder, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The company has had its circulation successes, too; Motor Trend
has a circulation of 1.25 million, while Hot Rod has 700,000
readers.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Kummerfeld, president of the Magazine Publishers of
America, said that Emap had its roots in outdoor publications like
Angling Times, but that most of its titles _ Nursing Times,
Insurance Age _ belonged to the prosaic trade press.
</P>
<P>
   Emap has also moved briskly into consumer magazines in Britain,
publishing FHM, an upscale men's magazine with a circulation of
750,000. Dunning, who will head Emap's Petersen's Division, said an
American edition of FHM was likely.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Kummerfeld said, Emap has ``a big online operation
in the United Kingdom, and quite a lot of Web sites.'' He added:
``They also have a very profitable radio division. It's become one
of the more aggressive international companies.'' Including the
Petersen magazines, Emap will now publish more than 600 titles.
</P>
<P>
   The keenness of the competition for younger readers in America
is underscored by a recent survey _ sponsored by Primedia _ that
showed that 12- to 19-year-olds have $500 million in spending money
available every week.
</P>
<P>
   Dunning said Tuesday that the new, magazine-rich Emap stable of
publications, with its emphasis on outdoor sports, engines and
electronics, hoped to provide one-stop shopping to advertisers who
want to reach readers of several magazines with a single buy.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of package has already been offered in conjunction
with the ``Gravity Games'' scheduled for broadcast by NBC on
several weekend afternoons next fall. Dunning said advertisers were
offered package deals including TV and 14 different Petersen
magazines that focus on the Gravity Games sports, like
skateboarding.

 By KATHRYN SHATTUCK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On an early afternoon in a sun-dappled corner of their stately
home in New Rochelle, N.Y., Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis were admiring
an enormous poinsettia, its vibrant red leaves shooting out into
all four corners of an otherwise coolly subdued living room.
</P>
<P>
   The plant _ ``the largest, most beautiful, most expensive we
could find,'' said Miss Dee _ was a gift from the couple to each
other on Dec. 9, the day of their 50th wedding anniversary. It will
be the only gift they exchange this year, a symbol for the only
gift they need at this juncture of their lives: each other.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say the event has gone unheralded. In November the
couple published a joint memoir, ``With Ossie and Ruby: In This
Life Together'' (William Morrow), an assessment of their
experiences together and apart. Tuesday night they celebrated with
a benefit at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Manhattan to raise money for
12 regional theaters like the ones in which they got their start.
(``We're giving back,'' said Miss Dee, who is 74.) Wednesday night
they are to join trap drummer Max Roach in ``Theater Pieces,'' an
evening of poetry, prose and music that is part of ``Max Roach's
America,'' a three-concert series at the 92nd Street Y.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the performance is ``Solo on the Drums,'' an
adaptation of a short story by Ann Petry described as ``a jazz
triangle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about a day in the life of a drummer who has just been
told early that morning by his beloved wife that she's leaving him
for the pianist in the band,'' Davis, who will be 81 Thursday, said
in his resonant bass. ``So they go downtown to perform and sitting
right across from him is the man who has taken his wife. And his
anger and his passion to murder fuse into a moment of such high
professionalism that when it's over he no longer feels the need to
kill but is satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We read the short story,'' he added. ``And as we read it, the
music aids and abets. And there we are, as we say, Max on drums,
James Williams on piano, and Ruby and Ossie on words. So we just
sort of jam a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The trio had been clamoring to rework the piece for the stage
since they first performed it for a PBS broadcast in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``Max is one of the icons in a field that is gradually growing
thinner,'' Davis said. ``He is still solid, still there, still
creating a statement. The honor to work with that man, oh my God,
it's hard to put into words. Nobody I know has been as insistent on
the dignity of black music.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are professionals who are out of this world, the way they
do things,'' Roach said of Miss Dee and Davis. ``They can come
right in and deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The son of a self-educated railroad construction engineer, Davis
was raised in rural Georgia, eventually leaving the countryside to
live with his grandmother in Waycross, a larger town, so that he
could receive a better education. After graduating from Howard
University in Washington, he traveled to New York, where he began
his acting career with the Rose McClendon Players in the basement
of the 124th Street Library in Harlem while attending drama classes
at Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of a waiter on the Pennsylvania Railroad, Miss Dee
graduated from Hunter College and went on to work with the American
Negro Theater, in the basement of the 135th Street Library, now
known as the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture.
</P>
<P>
   Though they insist their paths surely must have crossed in the
years they traversed the neighborhood, the couple met in 1945 when
they were both cast in the Broadway production of ``Jeb'' at the
Martin Beck Theater: he as the male lead, she as the understudy to
the female lead, a role she eventually took on. Neither can
remember the moment they met; they recall having felt as if they
had always known each other. They married three years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's here so fast,'' Miss Dee said of the landmark
anniversary. ``And I'm a little embarrassed to talk about it yet
I'm happy to talk about it. Because when you get there it can sound
very smarmy, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis interjected: ``And icky.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Dee added, sighing, ``And sentimental, and oh, my God,
oh.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the marriage has been a good one, producing
three children, seven grandchildren, two successful careers both
apart and in tandem, and an unflinching activism for causes social
and civil. Agreeing to disagree, they say, was often the key to
surviving. They are frank in their discussion of marriage, even, on
the topic of infidelity, which has crept into their safe haven.
</P>
<P>
   ``That we arrived at 50 years together is due as much to luck as
to love, and a talent for knowing, when we stumble, where to fall,
and how to get up again,'' they wrote in ``With Ossie and Ruby.''
``We two scavenged among the changes thrown up by the sexual
revolution that swept across the country, to find what suited us,
and what could be left alone.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s, after 15 years of marriage and with every
intention of staying married but with work that took them away from
each other, putting them in intimate contact with attractive people
for long periods, they decided to give themselves permission to
sleep with other partners ``as long as what we did was honest as
well as private, and that neither of us exposed the family to
scandal or disease,'' they wrote. ``We had to be discreet and, if
the word can be apt, honorable in our behavior, both to ourselves,
to whomever else might be involved, and most of all, to the
family.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea was hers, Davis said. She felt compelled to suggest the
arrangement for her own sake, Miss Dee replied, instead of
wondering where her husband had been and where he would go. She was
angry when he agreed to it. It was an arrangement not unlike many
of its time, and it had its points, like taking the sting out of
the loneliness.
</P>
<P>
   Each had a relationship that sent them looking homeward: she,
with a classical musician with a wife and children; he, with a
nurse on a movie set in Spain. Ultimately, they decided, the
arrangement was not appropriate for them.
</P>
<P>
   That they should share such a personal story with the public was
not out of character with the couple's philosophy of life. Their
marriage, their memoirs, their oral history, all are a part of a
broader picture that Miss Dee and Davis believe will serve future
generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a strange new time coming, and we need to somehow get out
there and test the waters for the people coming after,'' Miss Dee
said. ``We need to make the changes, do the revolutions and make
things right that will make it easier for our children and
grandchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis added: ``If we leave children to explore their own
sexuality unguided, then we end up with unwed mothers by the bushel
who haven't the slightest idea what they're doing or of the
consequences of their sexual actions. So now we cannot do without
absolute sexual frankness, whatever our previous reservations might
have been.''
</P>
<P>
   That the couple put their commitment to the test and survived
does not strike Miss Dee as odd or remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just staying together is not a real virtue, if you're not
happy,'' she said. ``Or you're being denied. Or one person is being
squashed. Or you really don't love each other; you're just there
out of habit. That doesn't work, no matter how many years you stay
together.''

NATIONS AGREE BOSNIA NEEDS CONTINUED INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT

<P>
   MADRID, Spain _ The United States and other countries that
support the Bosnian peace accord met in Madrid Tuesday and agreed
to press for deeper economic and governmental reforms to prepare
the nation to survive on its own.
</P>
<P>
   A Western official attending the third Bosnian Peace
Implementation Council, a periodic meeting of donor nations, said,
speaking on the condition of anonymity, that ``interventionism has
won out'' for at least two years, despite some objections from
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   A key goal of nations helping to carry out the peace accord is
the safe return home of Bosnian war refugees, who are estimated to
number more than one million.
</P>
<P>
   It has been particularly difficult to bring about the return of
refugees to areas controlled by members of other ethnic groups.
They have often met hostility or violence and have found their
homes occupied by members of the controlling group.
</P>
<P>
   The donor nations agreed that they would like to reduce their
aid to Bosnia, but no one here seemed willing to predict when the
international troops and civilian advisers would be sharply
reduced. Javier Solano, NATO secretary general, said an unspecified
number of troops might be withdrawn after June.
</P>
<P>
   Strobe Talbott, the U.S. deputy secretary of state, said, ``An
intensification of our effort in Bosnia is actually crucial to our
exit strategy.'' He added that no nation wants Bosnia to become a
permanent ``ward or protectorate of the international community.''
</P>
<P>
   Nikola Poplasen, who was recently elected leader of the Bosnian
Serb republic and is considered a hard-liner by the United States,
said at a news conference in Madrid Tuesday that the Bosnian people
did not need much outside help to fulfill the 1995 peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Under the accord, reached in Dayton, Ohio, that halted the
nearly four-year civil war, Bosnian Serbs control one part of the
country, and Muslims and Croats control the remainder, with a
tripartite presidency over both entities.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting here received a 39-page proposal, expected to be
approved on Wednesday, that says international assistance in Bosnia
``is at its height'' and ``will inevitably begin to reduce in the
near future.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal includes a detailed plan for refugee return and for
reforms in such areas as fostering economic competition _ in part
through privatization, reducing corruption and creating multiethnic
police forces and an independent judiciary and a free press.
</P>
<P>
   Poplasen said he was concerned that the measures being
considered here would give even more power to the top civilian
international official in Bosnia under the Dayton peace plan,
Carlos Westendorp, to dictate to Bosnian officials.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States and other Western powers, which have
34,000 peacekeeping troops in Bosnia and are providing about $1.5
billion annually in aid, remain skeptical about whether Bosnia is
ready do do without international support and supervision and were
making plans in Madrid to stay deeply involved for at least two
more years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace in Bosnia remains fragile _ it still cannot survive
without substantial international support,'' Westendorp told
representatives of the 47 nations at the conference. ``We must use
the next crucial two-year period to devote all the energy we can
muster to building a modern, democratic Bosnia.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Bosnian leaders are reported to be quite willing to adopt
reforms, but Western officials remain doubtful about Poplasen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's anti-democratic and anti-Dayton,'' said Robert Gelbard,
President Clinton's representative for carrying out the Dayton
accords. ``He is going to have to prove himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Westendorp, a Spanish diplomat, has used his office to enact
measures like a common Bosnian currency and a flag. But many
Western experts say the proposed deeper reforms may prove tougher
to carry out.

IRAQ ACCUSED OF ARMS VIOLATIONS THAT COULD RESULT IN AIR STRIKES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subbing throughout to insert details of report) (htv) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS and BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The chief U.N. arms inspector Tuesday accused Iraq of failing to
cooperate with inspections of its weapons programs, pushing
President Saddam Hussein toward a new military confrontation with
the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Only a month after Iraq averted an American-led attack by
pledging at the last minute to resume full cooperation, Richard
Butler, the chairman of the U.N. Special Commission overseeing the
disarmament of Iraq, declared in a report delivered to the Security
Council Tuesday night that Saddam's government continues to
obstruct inspections.
</P>
<P>
   He accused Iraq of failing to turn over documents that would
shed light on the development of chemical and biological weapons
and barring surprise inspections at a headquarters of Saddam's
Baath Party in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, officials responded grimly to Butler's report,
reiterating the administration's warnings that it was prepared to
respond to Iraqi noncompliance with force if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the House of Representatives' consideration of
four articles of impeachment against him, Clinton now faces a
decision on whether to order American forces into action against
Saddam. Clinton, returning to Washington Tuesday night from a
four-day trip to Israel, is scheduled to meet with his senior
national security aides Wednesday to decide how to respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand this report is very troubling,'' a senior
administration official said Tuesday night, speaking on the
condition of anonymity. ``It finds a lack of compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the timing of any strikes, the official replied
simply, ``We'll set the timetable; not the United Nations and not
Saddam Hussein.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing of any strikes could be complicated by Ramadan, the
Islamic holy month, which begins this weekend. Officials have in
the past speculated that the United States would be unlikely to
have a confrontation with Iraq during the holiday, for fearing of
stoking anti-American sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   The United States would also be unlikely to launch a strike
until the United Nations has had time to remove the remaining arms
inspectors from Iraq. That could take a day or so, leaving a
rapidly narrowing window of opportunity this week if Clinton
decides on an immediate response.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating Butler's conclusions, the president's national
security aides had already held a series of meetings, beginning on
Sunday. Secretary of Defense William Cohen and the chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry H. Shelton, postponed their
departures on separate trips to Europe over the weekend, though
their aides cited budget negotiations as the reason.
</P>
<P>
   One government official said the White House had asked military
commanders on the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the U.S. Central
Command to reactivate plans that were put on hold on Nov. 14 only
15 minutes before an attack was to begin.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, with Britain, had been prepared to launch a
first strike of nearly 300 cruise missiles from eight warships in
the Persian Gulf, followed by bombing raids from dozens of F-14 and
F-18 fighters aboard the aircraft carrier Dwight D. Eisenhower and
then from B-52 and B-1 bombers sent to the region.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called off that attack against the advice of most of his
national security team, including Cohen and Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, who argued that Iraq could not be trusted to
keep promises it had made and broken before.
</P>
<P>
   All the firepower the United States was prepared to let loose on
Iraq in November remains in the Persian Gulf. In fact, the Pentagon
has taken steps in recent days that have had the effect of
increasing the amount of weaponry temporarily, coinciding with
Butler's review.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Pentagon announced that it was sending eight
B-52's to replace seven now based on Diego Garcia, the British isle
in the Indian Ocean. Between now and Christmas, all 15 B-52's will
remain in the region.
</P>
<P>
   A group of nine warships led by the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson
is expected to arrive in the Persian Gulf by the end of the week,
joining the carrier Enterprise and 14 other combat warships in the
gulf, eight of them able to fire Tomahawk cruise missiles.

 UNDATED: cruise missiles. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Iraq did not provide the full cooperation it promised,'' the
report concluded. ``In addition, during the period under review,
Iraq initiated new forms of restrictions upon the commission's
work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq's conduct insured that no progress was able to be made in
either the fields of disarmament or accounting for its prohibited
weapons programs,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   The report catalogs a series of Iraqi refusals to extend full
access to inspectors or provide requested documentation since
inspections resumed in Iraq on Nov. 17, three days after Saddam
Hussein backed away from a total ban on inspections in the face of
an American military attack.
</P>
<P>
   While many monitoring operations were allowed to resume, Butler
said, routine inspections were being blocked by early December and
special surprise visits to new sites also met hurdles. Moreover,
there were places that appeared to have been ``cleaned'' before
inspectors arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``In light of the clear evidence that Iraq had taken advance
actions at certain of the locations planned for inspection in order
to defeat the purposes of inspection, the executive chairman
decided not to conduct the full range of inspections the team had
planned,'' Butler wrote. ``No inspections of presidential sites
took place.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate report, however, the International Atomic Energy
Agency, which monitors the Iraqi nuclear program, said that the
level of cooperation from Iraq since Nov. 17 has been satisfactory.
Independent nuclear experts said that this will lead to pressure
from Iraq's supporters to ``close the file'' on the Iraqi nuclear
program.
</P>
<P>
   In his report, Butler describes Iraqi policies on cooperation
with the inspectors that he considers to be fundamentally out of
line with the disarmament framework and regulations laid down by
the Security Council in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq's current claims that it has fulfilled all of its
disarmament obligations in each weapons area; ceased concealment
policies and actions; and that it has neither proscribed weapons
nor the ability to make them, cannot be accepted without further
verification,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Butler details recent incidents that demonstrate Iraq's
unwillingness to give the inspectors the access that Hussein's
government has promised the Secretary General and the Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
   The report concludes that given Iraq's resistance, the special
commission cannot conduct full inspections and therefore cannot say
with any assurance that Iraq has met its disarmament requirements.
</P>
<P>
   At the State Department, the deputy spokesman, James Foley, said
that Butler's report was ``a very serious matter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect that the President will review Chairman Butler's
conclusions with his senior advisers,'' Foley said. ``I can't
speculate on what decisions the President will make. We believe we
have all the authority we need under relevant Security Council
resolutions to act. All options remain on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the report on Iraqi compliance triggers military
action, it will provide the basis for making decisions about how to
proceed diplomatically with Iraq in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Butler report is, first of all, the key to Iraq's hopes of
getting a comprehensive review of its relations with the United
Nations and the progress or lack of it Baghdad has made in more
than eight years since sanctions were imposed after the August 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, in a covering letter to the Security Council,
Secretary-General Kofi Annan appears to acknowledge that Iraq has
not met the test of full cooperation, but sets out three possible
ways to proceed with the comprehensive review: cancel it, give Iraq
more time to meet its obligations or hold it anyway for the sake of
the Council.
</P>
<P>
   Coming in the midst of Washington's roiling debate over
impeachment, the latest confrontation will inevitably raise
accusations that Clinton may use Saddam as a diversion.
</P>
<P>
   On NBC's ``Meet the Press'' on Sunday, Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas,
the majority whip leading the House's impeachment effort, responded
bluntly when asked about the prospect of a strike on Iraq, accusing
the president of manipulating foreign policy to divert attention
from his personal and political crises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, about the time he was supposed to give the
deposition in January, he sent the troops and rattled his sabers at
Saddam Hussein?'' DeLay said. ``Nothing happened. Remember in
November _ I mean in June, he went to China after moving that trip
from November to June, when he thought he was going to be in trial
with Paula Jones? And then again in August, he starts rattling his
saber again and backs off. That's what's happening.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in August, Clinton did order cruise missile strikes
against paramilitary camps in Afghanistan and a pharmaceutical
factory in the Sudan _ on the day Monica Lewinsky appeared for a
second time before the federal grand jury investigating Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Clinton angrily dismiss the notion, pointing out that
the periodic confrontations with Iraq have been driven by Saddam's
defiance.

   CHEVRON PLANS TO CUT JOBS AND CAPITAL SPENDING &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Joining the list of major oil companies that are retrenching in
the face of low crude oil prices, Chevron announced cuts in capital
spending and employment, primarily in North America.
</P>
<P>
   The company intends to reduce costs by $500 million in 1999 and
cut capital spending by 8 percent, to $5.1 billion, next year,
mostly in its older exploration and production, refining and
marketing and chemical businesses in North America. The cuts in its
work force of 34,000 will be modest, the company said. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A SHIFT IN CASE AGAINST MICROSOFT &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The government's antitrust case against Microsoft turned from
evidence supplied by competitors to allegations of cajoling and
threatening from companies that for the most part posed no obvious
competitive threat, ranging from IBM and MCI to Walt Disney. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Denying Microsoft access to the research of two business school
professors, a federal appeals court ruled that scholars should be
granted First Amendment privileges similar to those of
journalists. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   MAGAZINE PUBLISHER IS SOLD &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Petersen Companies, the publisher of Motor Trend, Hot Rod, Guns
&AMP; Ammo and dozens of other magazines, is being bought by a British
magazine publisher, Emap, in a deal valued at $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Petersen, which has been one of the fastest-growing magazine
companies _ with a particular focus on the young male audience _
will continue to seek acquisitions as a division of Emap, according
to its current chairman and chief executive, James D. Dunning Jr. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>

appointing a committee of scholars to investigate its activities
during the Nazi era. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   STOCKS REBOUND AFTER SELLOFF &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stocks broke a five-session losing streak in a reversal traders
and analysts said was a rebound from a selloff that had gone too
far. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 127.70 points, or 1.5
percent, to 8,823.30. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index gained
21.63 points, or 1.9 percent, to 1,162.83, and the NASDAQ composite
index rose 45.68 points, or 2.32 percent, to 2,012.60. In the bond
market, Treasury prices fell as the yield on the 30-year issue rose
to 5.02 percent. &QL;

   Executives of the Tokyo Stock Exchange will return part of their
salaries to take responsibility for recent computer problems, the

<P>
   NO SIGN OF HIGHER INFLATION &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Labor Department data showed inflation remained subdued in
November. The Consumer Price Index, the government's main inflation
gauge, rose 0.2 percent, matching the October increase. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   COLTEC SHARES RISE IN MERGER FIGHT &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Coltec Industries rose $2, or 12 percent, to $18.6875,
as Crane pursued its attempt to block a planned $1.3 billion merger
between Coltec and B.F. Goodrich. Goodrich said it had no plans to
drop its offer to buy Coltec, a maker of aerospace components and
industrial products in Charlotte, N.C. But several Coltec

</P>

   ``But I have no doubt that a lot of blame also lies with the

indictment, knowing full well that it's almost a certainty that the
Senate will go along with the expressed wishes of the American

JUSTICE DEPT. WARNS GROUP AIDING IRAQ THAT IT NEEDS PERMIT 
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ An American group opposed to sanctions against
Iraq has run into trouble with the federal government for taking
medicines and toys to Baghdad to give to Iraqis who are suffering
from the effects of the embargo.
</P>
<P>
   The group, Voices in the Wilderness, plans to announce at a news
conference Wednesday in Chicago that it and four members had
received a warning from the Office of Foreign Assets Control in the
Justice Department that the organization might be fined more than
$160,000 for taking goods to Iraq without authorization in 1996 and
last year.
</P>
<P>
   An organizer of the campaign, Kathy Kelly, said in an interview
Tuesday that the group intended to reject the warning, which it has
30 days to contest, and instead to demonstrate against sanctions
this month in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't pay any penalties. That's certain,'' Ms. Kelly said.
The group, which has sponsored 18 trips to Iraq, was formed to
oppose sanctions and has made its trips to Iraq public displays of
defiance, saying the dangerous nation is not Iraq, but the United
States. In Baghdad the group has picketed the headquarters of the
United Nations Special Commission, the agency charged with
disarming Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biological warfare is being waged against Iraqi children,''
Ms. Kelly said. ``I've seen a child die before my eyes from a
waterborne disease. And this offensive is being waged by our
country, as our country accuses Iraq of possibly having a huge
threatening arsenal of weapons of mass destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   She cited Iraqi figures, reflected in U.N. reports, that 6,000
children were dying in Iraq monthly because of malnutrition and
treatable diseases that were not treated because of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kelly said the primary goal of her group was to convince
Americans that Iraqis were paying too high a price for U.S. policy.
</P>
<P>
   Other groups have taken medicine, food and other goods to Iraq
without encountering legal problems.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Office of Foreign Assets Control said
Tuesday that it was not against the law to take essential civilian
goods to Iraq, if the group applies for a license. Other groups
have done so, the spokesman said, but Voices in the Wilderness has
not.
</P>
<P>
   Some administration officials and diplomats here say, though,
that Voices in the Wilderness has deliberately provoked
controversy, a contention that the group does not deny, while other
relief organizations have quietly notified the government and U.N.
officials and traveled to Iraq with less publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go very much for spiritual and humanitarian reasons,'' a
spokesman for one group said Tuesday. ``We respect our government,
even if we don't agree with everything they do. We have not gone to
Iraq simply to defy a law.''
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, Ms. Kelly said that her group had taken nearly
$500,000 worth of goods into Iraq on its 18 trips and that it was
also helping Iraqis. She said her passport was impounded in
February 1997, when she returned from a trip. It was returned to
her, and she made a trip last month.
</P>
<P>
   Many items have been confiscated from the four members named in
the warning when they returned from trips to Baghdad, for violating
a rule against importing goods from Iraq. The items included
videocassettes, tapes and objects as small as souvenirs, a stamp,
the label from a water bottle, a necklace and a wood drum.

MICROSOFT DENIED ACCESS TO SCHOLARS' TAPES

<P>
   Denying the Microsoft Corp. access to the research of two
business school professors, a federal appeals court ruled Tuesday
that scholars should be granted First Amendment privileges similar
to those of journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft sought the unpublished notes and tapes of interviews
conducted by the professors for use in its defense in the antitrust
suit brought by the government.
</P>
<P>
   The suit contends that Microsoft used its market power illegally
to thwart competition from its main rival for Internet browsing
software, the Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The rivalry of the two companies is the focus of ``Competing on
Internet Time: Lessons From Netscape and Its Battle With
Microsoft,'' a new book by Michael A. Cusumano, a professor at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management,
and David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft wanted the authors' notes and tapes from interviews
with Netscape executives to help show that the Internet pioneer's
struggles were due to its own missteps _ not a result of
Microsoft's predatory tactics, as the Justice Department alleges.
</P>
<P>
   But the authors argued that they had conducted interviews with
the understanding that the Netscape executives would speak freely
but could ask that sensitive information remain confidential.
</P>
<P>
   Courts routinely recognize that kind of confidentiality
agreement between journalists and people they interview. In its
24-page decision, the appeals court said: ``Just as a journalist,
stripped of sources, would write fewer, less incisive articles, an
academician, stripped of sources, would be able to provide fewer,
less cogent analyses. Such similarities of concern and function
militate in favor of a similar level of protection for journalists
and academic researchers.''
</P>
<P>
   The court's ruling, said Jeffrey Swope, a lawyer for MIT, was a
``signal step in recognizing the validity of confidentiality in
this kind of academic research.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by a three-judge panel, which Microsoft could appeal
to the full appeals court or to the Supreme Court, could be
particularly significant for business school research, which often
depends on the trust of industry executives who share sensitive
information with professors. Cusumano said that he and Yoffie
``both felt that our livelihoods _ and the work of scholars at
business schools across the country _ were at stake.''

JURY VINDICATES ANDREW LLOYD WEBBER 
</HEADLINE>

 By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A day after hearing Andrew Lloyd Webber play excerpts
from his music at the piano, a federal court jury in Manhattan
Tuesday denied a claim by another composer that Lloyd Webber had
stolen a musical passage for use in ``The Phantom of the Opera.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury had been asked to decide if Lloyd Webber used a section
of a 1978 song by Ray Repp, a composer of religious folk music, in
the main theme of ``Phantom.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a charge that the British composer denied in testimony on
Monday. He played selections of his music on a piano moved into the
courtroom to illustrate the genesis of his song.
</P>
<P>
   The jury took little more than an hour to rule in Lloyd Webber's
favor.
</P>
<P>
   For Repp, the verdict was the end of a long legal battle that
began after he first heard the ``Phantom'' theme in 1989. Saying he
was struck by the theme's similarity to his Bible-inspired ballad
``Till You,'' Repp filed a copyright infringement lawsuit a year
later.
</P>
<P>
   After eight years of legal machinations, Repp was granted a jury
trial in January by a federal appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very personal song for me,'' Repp said of ``Till
You.'' ``I am particularly upset at the way it's been used.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the verdict, Repp voiced doubt about overcoming the
reputation of Lloyd Webber, who has won several Tony Awards and was
knighted by Queen Elizabeth II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phantom of the Opera,'' which opened in New York in 1988, has
grossed more than $1 billion worldwide. The recorded version of
``Till You,'' on the other hand, had not yet earned $100 when its
sales were last reported in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   As for Lloyd Webber, the verdict allowed him to return to London
victorious Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been totally vindicated,'' he said in a statement.
``Perhaps we will now see the end of these money-grabbing spurious
cases.''

CONTRADICTIONS SEEN IN REPORT ON POSSIBLE NUCLEAR-WASTE SITE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Nev.)   (mk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After 15 years and $6 billion of research, the
Energy Department plans to release this week its first detailed
analysis of whether Yucca Mountain, in the Nevada desert, is a good
place to bury nuclear waste for what amounts to eternity.
</P>
<P>
   The report is expected to say there is no reason to stop
investigating Yucca Mountain, near Las Vegas, as the site for
storing thousands of tons of long-lived radioactive waste from the
production of electricity and nuclear weapons. But according to
people who have been briefed on the assessment, and public comments
by agencies advising the Energy Department, several contradictory
points are contained within its thousands of pages
</P>
<P>
   First, water has been found to move through the desert mountain
faster than many proponents of the site had hoped, posing the
possibility that nuclear contamination could be carried relatively
quickly into the groundwater under the mountain and then beyond the
boundaries of the waste repository.
</P>
<P>
   Because the mountain alone will not be able to contain the waste
without some help from man, if then, engineering details such as
how the wastes are packaged and how the storage tunnels are laid
out will be crucial, the assessment states.
</P>
<P>
   But the report's supporting documents also predict that the peak
period of radioactive releases from the waste will be so far in the
future _ 200,000 years or more _ that man-made features, like
corrosion-resistant canisters, will not be reliable.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Energy Department, which was supposed to have
begun accepting reactor waste in February, say the report, known as
a viability assessment, merely lays out a path for further research
before 2001, when the department is supposed to make a
recommendation on the site to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Department officials and nuclear-power executives say the
assessment is a step toward the department being able to recommend
the site, even if the rock is not as impermeable as once believed.
</P>
<P>
   But other experts, including independent reviewers brought in by
the department, say that making any predictions about the site will
be extremely difficult if the Environmental Protection Agency,
which must eventually establish the criteria for it, decides that
it must perform well hundreds of thousands of years from now. Two
thousand centuries from now, they say, Yucca Mountain, now one of
the driest and most remote places in the United States, may no
longer be desert.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary William Richardson said in a telephone
interview that predictions would be stated in probabilities.
``That's all one can offer,'' he said. ``I don't think in science
one can offer certainty.''
</P>
<P>
   The assessment runs five volumes; thousands of supporting
documents have already been made public. Many are available at
http://www.ymp.gov/va.htm.
</P>
<P>
   The nuclear industry, which is eager for the government to take
spent reactor fuel off its hands, is asserting that the assessment
shows there are no ``show-stoppers'' that would nullify Congress'
instructions to the Energy Department to investigate Yucca
Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Garrish, an expert on waste at the Nuclear Energy
Institute, the industry's trade association, said study of the
mountain was going through ``a natural progression'' into man-made
aspects of the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're saying what kind of engineering needs to be put into
this site to make this thing work,'' Garrish said. ``This is a
combination of geology and man-made barriers and engineering.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrish also said that the work thus far is sufficient to lay to
rest some concerns _ for example, that a volcano or an earthquake
would disturb the site.
</P>
<P>
   But outside scientists have raised many questions about the
research. Many of these scientists are not hostile to the idea of
burying the wastes at Yucca, but say that evaluation of the 15
years of research points to many unanswered questions.
</P>
<P>
   Recent reviews by outside scientists found that not enough is
known about how water, the main vector in spreading the wastes,
will flow through the mountain in coming millennia, when rainfall
may be triple the mountain's current six inches a year. The time
scale is so long that it probably includes climactic changes
including ice ages.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Greenhouse gas warming is a little blip on the screen,
compared to longer-term changes we're going to see here,'' said
another independent scientist who has seen the statement.
Scientists have already found that in the section of the mountain
where the waste would go, 1,000 feet below the surface, water shows
signs of atomic bomb fallout, which means that it made the trip in
the last 50 years, after atmospheric nuclear testing began.
</P>
<P>
   To carry wastes from the site, the water would have to percolate
down another 1,000 feet to reach the water table, but a report last
month to Congress and the Energy Department by a panel of outside
scientists, the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, found that
water may flow relatively quickly, through rock fractures.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the usefulness of the area above the water table
as a barrier was ``uncertain,'' and that during times when the
climate in Nevada is wetter than it is now, travel times could be
``several hundred years or shorter,'' which is brief compared to
the longevity of the wastes.
</P>
<P>
   How fast the waste moves depends heavily on the amount of
rainfall, but even the U.S. Geological Survey, the organization
that first identified the region in 1976 as a likely site for
burying waste, said in a report to the Energy Department this month
that ``there is surprisingly little'' in the assessment about
``reckoning the uncertainties in either past or future climates.''
</P>
<P>
   Department officials say that shifting the focus of research to
engineering considerations is natural. ``In any scientific
endeavor, it starts off seeming simple, and you will find more and
more questions,'' said one high-ranking department official,
speaking on condition that he not be further identified. Most of
those willing to talk about the study said they did not want to
comment on the record before it is released by Richardson, who
could make changes in its findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``People used to think, 20 years ago, that the geology was so
good, you don't have to worry much about the man-made part,'' said
the official. But no matter what site was chosen, ``you find more
and more you need to explain,'' he said, and eventually, engineers
will have to address the question of how the metal of the waste
containers, and how the heat created by the wastes, will interact
with the rock at the site chosen.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the shift in attention, the department has been
testing the corrosion resistance of a nickel alloy that it wants to
use to package the spent fuel; scientists think those tests could
be used to predict the metal's performance for centuries or even a
few thousand years. But, said one scientist who was asked by the
Energy Department to evaluate its research, ``if you want to
extrapolate from two years to 100,000 years, good luck. There's no
good theoretical basis for your extrapolations.''
</P>
<P>
   And no one is clear on how much extrapolation is necessary,
because the period for which the repository should be expected to
contain the wastes has not been established. In the 1980s, the
Environmental Protection Agency suggested 10,000 years in a draft
rule that was later withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   In 10,000 years the most intensely radioactive wastes, like
cesium and strontium, will have decayed away, but the plutonium and
other man-made elements will still have most of their
radioactivity.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from Richard Butler's report to Secretary
General Kofi Annan, as provided by the United Nations: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the years that have passed and the extensive work
that has been undertaken it has not been possible to verify Iraq's
claims with respect to the nature and the magnitude of its
proscribed weapons programs and their current disposition.
</P>
<P>
   With respect to this latter point two comments are apposite.
</P>
<P>
   First, Iraq's current claims that it has fulfilled all of its
disarmament obligations in each weapons area; ceased concealment
policies and actions, and that it has neither proscribed weapons
nor the ability to make them cannot be accepted without further
verification.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, documents or records available in Iraq in which
relevant details of its proscribed programs and actions are
reported: production records; records of disposition of weapons,
and records of claimed destruction, relevant policy decisions and
decisions on termination of concealment would be invaluable in
helping to close remaining gaps and achieve acceptable confidence
in Iraqi declarations.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council recognized these two aspects in Resolution
707 (1991), when it demanded Iraq provide immediate and
unconditional access to, inter alia, records and demanded that Iraq
cease attempts to conceal prohibited materials.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the commission's requests for relevant documents,
Iraq has repeatedly claimed that they no longer exist or cannot be
located, a claim which very often has been shown to be false,
either because inspection activities have in fact located precisely
such documents or because Iraq has reversed its stated position and
then produced relevant documents.
</P>
<P>
   The commission briefed the council on its assessment of the
existence and the importance of documents in June 1998. The
commission has assessed since the ``chicken farm'' event of 1995
that only selected categories of documents were provided and that
other categories were retained by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   It remains the commission's strong view that under the present
circumstances relevant documentation must exist in Iraq and that
provision of such documentation is the best hope for revealing the
full picture, as required by the relevant resolutions. ...
</P>
<P>
   On 17 November 1998 the commission began to resume its work in
Iraq across the full range of its activities. Accordingly that work
was focused on four main areas, pursuant to the commission's
mandate: requests for information through access to documents and
interviews of Iraqi personnel; monitoring inspections; inspection
of capable sites, and disarmament inspections relating to
proscribed weapons and activities. ...
</P>
<P>
   During the reporting period a biological inspection team
requested Iraq's authorities to provide access to a number of
specific documents. One document had already been seen by the
commission, in 1995. These documents were not given to the
inspection team.
</P>
<P>
   On 19 November 1998, Iraq was requested to provide explanations
and clarifications on outstanding disarmament issues in the
chemical weapons and missile areas. Furthermore, Iraq was requested
to allow the removal for analysis of a number of missile engine
components produced by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   In the chemical weapons area Iraq provided, as requested, a
report on its analysis of the samples from the special missile
warhead fragments. On the issue of VX, Iraq for the first time
claimed that the contamination of the warhead fragments had been
the result of a deliberate act of tampering with the samples taken
to the United States. Iraq made this statement despite the
conclusions drawn by three international expert teams, which
confirmed that all analytical results were valid and conclusive.
...
</P>
<P>
   As is evident from this report Iraq did not provide the full
cooperation it promised on 14 November 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In addition during the period under review Iraq initiated new
forms of restrictions upon the commission's work. Amongst the
commission's many concerns about this retrograde step is what such
further restrictions might mean for the effectiveness of long-term
monitoring activities.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the opportunity presented by the circumstances of
the last month, including the prospect of a comprehensive review,
Iraq's conduct insured that no progress was able to be made in
either the fields of disarmament or accounting for its prohibited
weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in the light of this experience, that is, the absence
of full cooperation by Iraq, it must regrettable be recorded again
that the commission is not able to conduct the substantive
disarmament work mandated to it by the Security Council and, thus,
to give the council the assurances it requires with respect to
Iraq's prohibited weapons programs.

</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Dec. 16:
</P>
<P>
   Just about any citizen who follows the news could write the one
paragraph synopsis of what history will make of William Jefferson
Clinton, a man blessed with great talent and afflicted with a
mysterious passion for lying. But as the members of the House of
Representatives gather in the Capitol, our thoughts must turn to
the question of what history will make of this Congress' handling
of its impeachment powers. That judgment will depend on whether the
designated speaker, Robert Livingston, produces a result that
depends on something other than the fact that he can muster the
votes to do what he chooses. Livingston and his political id, Tom
DeLay, should know that only in the recording of battles does
history applaud the unmitigated application of power. When it comes
to governance, the laurels are reserved for those who demonstrate
wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   To predict historical judgments, of course, one must first
examine past judgments. Why, for example, has Congress' handling of
Watergate and the resulting forced resignation come to be regarded
as a model of constitutional process? The fundamental reasons are
that the congressional consensus to punish Richard Nixon was
bipartisan and that a majority of the American people, including
many of his former supporters, wanted him out of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The Partisan Bias
</P>
<P>
   The opposite realities prevail in the case of Bill Clinton's
crimes. Two-thirds of the American people want him to finish his
term. The vote against him will be almost strictly partisan,
meaning that the Republican victory will meet the arithmetic
requirements of the Constitution, but will not carry its
magisterial authority. History, in our view, will condemn the
Republicans for using their constitutional powers as an instrument
of partisan vengeance. That instrument was intended as a scalpel
for the cutting out of cancers, not for the excising of unsightly
pimples.
</P>
<P>
   We say that from the platform of our record of consistently
criticizing Clinton's ugly little lies, his abject failure to lead
by example and to speak truthfully to the American people, his
equally dismal failure to honor the historic residence entrusted to
him, and his abandonment of his constitutional duty to defend and
uphold the law. He is, in sum, a man you cannot trust whether you
have his handshake, his signature or his word on a Bible.
</P>
<P>
   If impeachment by the House and removal by the Senate would
simply harm him and not the Constitution, we would be all for it.
But under the present circumstances of a polarized party-line vote,
it would assault the Constitution as well as public confidence in
that most precious American asset, the orderly, quadrennial
surrender of power from one chief executive to another and often
from one party to another.
</P>
<P>
   That transfer of power without gunfire or legislative chicanery
is the jewel in the crown of American democracy. It should not be
sacrificed over Bill Clinton's inability to resist looking at thong
underwear. If the Republicans remove him by simple force of
numbers, the debate over whether this was a political coup will
continue for decades and could become a bigger threat to civic
stability than Clinton's mendacity.
</P>
<P>
   Constitutional Precedents
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday will be setting precedents by which the
nation will be governed when this presidency is a memory as distant
and distasteful as that of Warren G. Harding. A basic principle for
impeachment ought to be that presidents stay in office unless the
case against them is so strong that it persuades at least a
substantial part of the public _ and their representatives in
Congress _ on the grounds specified by the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Another basic threat to future interpretation of the
Constitution is the judiciary committee's insistence that
impeachment could be undertaken as a kind of ``ultimate censure,''
rather than a somber, considered recommendation that the president
be removed. This aberrant interpretation of constitutional
procedure invites promiscuous application of the impeachment
process whenever future presidents and Congresses find themselves
in unresolvable partisan conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Although the words allow for a wide range of interpretation, the
Republicans in the House cannot pretend, in the manner of a Bill
Clinton disquisition on the meaning of ``is,'' that they do not
understand the core import of ``high crimes and misdemeanors.'' The
phrase refers to offenses against the state that threaten the
nation's security or the stability of its civic order and to major
personal crimes such as murder.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's offenses threaten us with embarrassment. They threaten
us with the possibility that young Americans will see him as a role
model. They cry out for condemnation so that no citizen will be
tempted to follow his example or regret his departure _ in due
time. But they do not threaten the future of a republic that
defines itself through politics and whose politics defines itself
through conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The Moderates' Duty
</P>
<P>
   We come to that position as a page that has warned often and,
according to some of our critics, too forcefully about Clinton's
poisoning effect on political trust and on Washington's respect for
campaign-finance laws. We believe the evidence presents an ironclad
case that he lied, by plan and repetitiously, while under oath in a
civil suit and before a grand jury. But the lies were those of a
sneak, not those of person plotting to topple or betray the
government. In constitutional terms, the continuity of elections is
more important than punishing these contemptible, but not
nation-threatening failings.
</P>
<P>
   In advocating censure, we have consistently urged the House not
to offer it in the absence of an admission of lying by the
president. But now that the decisive moment is at hand, we urge the
moderate Republicans who hold the balance of power to vote against
impeachment even if Clinton does not confess. The constitutional
logic for that bottom line is explained above. The political logic
is based on our view that the days ahead will bring out alternative
political means of punishing Clinton. Also, there remains a bare
chance that good sense could break out in the White House and
Clinton could make a deal based on confessing to his lies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's Day
</P>
<P>
   As today unfolds, we shall see whether Clinton, like Achilles,
sulks in his tent, or whether he sheds his defendant's weeds and
becomes a shaper of his fate. Surely he sees that he returned to
Washington to find few elements of his presidency intact beyond his
stubbornness and the public's desire to see him finish out the most
disappointing White House tenure since that of Richard Nixon.
Wrapped in dishonor, his face a mask of depression, Clinton
presents his staff and congressional mediators with the highly
unusual task of rousing a president to coping with the realities of
his job and situation.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Clinton is not the only stockholder in this
coalescing disaster. The right-wing captivity of the Republican
Party has never been more destructive. We have to believe that the
much-maligned Newt Gingrich, had he continued to function as
speaker, would have exerted statesmanlike leadership. As a scholar
of history, Gingrich as head of the House would have recognized
that the case developed by Rep. Henry Hyde and the judiciary
committee was not impeachable. As a practicing bully, he would not
have cowered, as Livingston did, before the GOP strong-armers.
</P>
<P>
   A condemnation of judiciary's railroading of the case does not
mean it should not have been investigated. The whiff of scandal and
the tactic of stonewalling have been part of this administration
since 1993. Once organized provable lying emerged as a White House
tactic, as it did early on, the judiciary inquiry was mandatory.
But the constitutional process cannot reach its proper destination
without either a change of course by Livingston, Clinton or wiser
people who step forward either before or after the impeachment that
now looks certain barring dramatic developments Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Wisdom of Censure
</P>
<P>
   To be realistic, the censure option still has a pulse, but it is
as faint as it can get without stopping altogether. While Clinton
was in Israel, the band of 30 or so undecided Republican moderates
dwindled to a handful because the president refused to meet their
price of an admission that he lied under oath. What happens next in
that regard depends in part on whether Clinton and his lawyers
enter the last-minute bargaining being urged by two junior
Republicans, Reps. Chris Shays of Connecticut and Michael Castle of
Delaware. Shays is reportedly willing to bring a half-dozen or so
Republicans and some cooperating Democrats to the White House.
Perhaps they could thread the needle by selling Clinton language
like ``I lied under oath, but that intent was not in my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Moderate Republicans can confidently vote against impeachment in
the knowledge that, if impeachment fails, even the Republican
leaders will want the kind of censure they have disingenuously
dismissed as unconstitutional. Moreover, the proposal by former
Sen. Bob Dole for a joint House-Senate resolution of condemnation
has provoked serious discussion. Even if impeachment passes,
according to Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, such a resolution could
be offered as a binding substitute that would have the force of law
once the president signs it. As such, Moynihan said, it could be
worded so as to make future prosecution a practical impossibility,
freeing Clinton to admit what everyone knows about his repeated and
purposeful lies. We elected him to lead a great nation. He became a
prince of disorder. Now it is up to Congress and the public to
limit the damage caused by his irresponsibility.

ENDEAVOUR LANDS AFTER 12-DAY SPACE STATION MISSION 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Endeavour astronauts ended their 12-day space station
assembly mission late Tuesday, landing at the Kennedy Space Center
in Florida after a fiery re-entry through the Earth's atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle crew touched down at 10:53 p.m., EST, skirting
earlier threats of cloudy skies and rain showers that could have
forced postponement.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the 10th time in the shuttle program's 17-year
history of 93 flights that a shuttle crew has landed in darkness.
With commander Bob Cabana and pilot Rick Sturckow at the controls,
the shuttle crew made its long glide and approach from the
southwest and over the Gulf of Mexico with electronic navigational
aids but no lights.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt it is great to be home after such an exciting
mission,'' said Cabana as the shuttle stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Horowitz of mission control said, ``Thanks a lot for an
awesome job starting our space station adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   Thrilled with the success of their difficult flight after more
than two years of training, the astronauts were eager to get back
to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all packed up and ready to come home,'' said Cabana as
his crew made final preparations to return to Earth. ``We can't
wait to get back, see our families and have a great Christmas''
</P>
<P>
   Cabana and fellow astronauts Nancy Currie, Jim Newman, Jerry
Ross, Sturckow and Russian cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev blasted off
Dec. 4 with the second large component of the new international
space station, a module called ``Unity.''
</P>
<P>
   They rendezvoused with the first component, a Russian-built and
launched power and propulsion module called ``Zarya,'' Russian for
``sunrise.''
</P>
<P>
   Using the shuttle's robot arm and three spacewalks by Ross and
Newman, they linked the two modules, creating a single uninhabited
35-ton, 75-foot-long structure that circles the Earth at more than
240 miles high. The new spacecraft is monitored by ground control
teams in Houston and suburban Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttle astronauts are to return to the fledgling outpost with
more components and equipment in May. All told, the full assembly
will require six years and 45 assembly missions. The first resident
crew is scheduled for launching in January 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Endeavour's crew planned to rest Wednesday in Florida, following
routine medical exams and reunions with their families.
</P>
<P>
   They were to return Thursday to Houston about 2 p.m., CST. The
space agency planned a brief welcoming ceremony at Ellington Field.

BERTELSMANN PLANS INQUIRY ON ITS ROLE DURING NAZI ERA
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bertelsmann AG, the German conglomerate that owns Random House
and is a partner with Barnes &AMP; Noble in its Internet bookstore, is
appointing a committee of scholars to investigate its activities
during the Nazi era.
</P>
<P>
   Bertelsmann chairman Thomas Middelhoff said the decision was in
response to a recent article in the Swiss magazine Die Weltwoche,
which contended that Bertelsmann had misled the public about its
activities during the Hitler regime and that it had also published
pro-Nazi books in the 1930s and '40s. The accusations are also in
the current issue of The Nation in an article by Hersch Fischler, a
German sociologist and researcher who wrote the article for the
Swiss magazine, and John Friedman, a journalist and documentary
filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   After the Swiss article was published, Bertelsmann also withdrew
its corporate history from its Web site for evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Bertelsmann has said it had opposed the Nazis, who closed the
company in 1943. Last summer, Middelhoff said in a speech, ``I am
very fortunate that I work for a company that has always taken a
stand for racial and religious freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Middelhoff said in a phone interview Tuesday that he had
believed that the company's official history, which was published
in 1985, was accurate. ``But when somebody like Fischler says,
`Listen I have another understanding,' then there is a question. Do
we reject that or handle it in an open-minded way?''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the panel investigating the company's past would
include three historians, including an American and one with ``a
Jewish background.'' There would also be a second panel that would
insure the independence of the historians' work. All findings will
be published without any additions and without company censorship,
Middelhoff said.
</P>
<P>
   The Nation article said that Bertelsmann was the biggest
supplier of propaganda books to Hitler's army and the SS. Among its
pro-Nazi books, according to the article, was ``Dr. Martin Luther's
Little Catechism for the Man in Brown,'' intended for Nazi
brownshirts.
</P>
<P>
   Middelhoff, speaking from the company's headquarters in
Guetersloh, said Bertelsmann had published the titles listed by The
Nation. ``We have about 10 or 15 abhorrent books,'' Middelhoff
said. ``I can't read them because there is such an awful content.
We believe about three were banned,'' meaning that after
publication the Nazis deemed them not sympathetic enough despite
their sentiments. One ``banned'' book was ``Dr. Martin Luther's
Little Catechism for the Man in Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nation article also reported that Heinrich Mohn,
Bertelsmann's chief executive at the time, was a ``passive'' member
of the SS, meaning one who paid dues but did not participate in all
its activities. Middelhoff agreed that Mohn had been a passive
member but added, ``I believe that wasn't unusual for that time in
Germany.'' Still, he said, that ``is not an excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said, ``There was no question that Bertelsmann was
closed by the Nazis and three managers were jailed.'' But he said
he did not know whether all the company's divisions had been
closed. &QL;

AT LAST, IT'S OFFICIAL: SPITZER DEFEATS VACCO 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After six weeks of rancorous, highly partisan
dialogue regarding its outcome, the race for state attorney general
was officially settled in a quiet meeting Tuesday at a rest stop
along the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the other winners of statewide offices, the state
Board of Elections certified Eliot Spitzer as the state's 63rd
attorney general. The meeting _ held a day after Dennis Vacco, the
Republican incumbent, conceded defeat _ was at a conference center
at a rest stop in Sloatsburg, about 35 miles north of New York City
in Rockland County.
</P>
<P>
   The board has often used the site because it does not require
extensive travel for either the members from the New York City
metropolitan area or for staff members based in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   The board certified Spitzer the winner by a margin of 25,186
votes _ 2,084,948 to Vacco's 2,059,762 votes.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, it was unclear whether the certification would take
place by Dec. 15, the date required under state law. Vacco charged
that widespread voter fraud in New York City had affected the
results and had asked a judge either to declare him the winner or
to order a new election.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Vacco failed to substantiate his allegations and the
matter was dismissed by a state Supreme Court justice on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   While the certification of the candidates took all of 15 minutes
and went smoothly, some issues were raised. The two Republicans on
the four-member board, while voting to certify the results, asked
to have the record reflect their desire to have Vacco's allegations
investigated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of the record,'' said Lee Daghlian, a spokesman for
the state Board of Elections, ``and I'm assuming they will ask the
New York City Board of Elections to take a closer look at the
charges.''
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said he was ``thrilled and gratified'' that the election
was now settled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm looking forward to a two-week transition that
will be compressed and exciting,'' he said Tuesday.

<P>
   NORWALK, Conn. _ About 2,000 people packed an auditorium to
overflowing Tuesday night in a passionate, sometimes raucous town
meeting to give their views on impeachment to their congressman,
Christopher Shays, one of the few Republicans who has opposed the
charges against President Clinton, until now at least.
</P>
<P>
   Shays told the audience that he would still vote not to impeach
if the vote were held immediately, but he might reconsider his
opposition after a meeting with the president on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Shays said he did not believe that the charges against the
president were impeachable offenses. ``But it is darn close,'' he
said, ``and that's the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Shays hastily called the town meeting Tuesday in part to help
him come to terms with how he should vote when the full House takes
up the matter as early as Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Shays' suspenseful position did not seem to disturb the more
than 1,100 people in the auditorium in Norwalk City Hall and the
800 people who were forced to mill about the City Hall lobby after
the local fire officials ruled that the auditorium was filled to
capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many praised the congressman for being so deliberative.
With Shays moderating with a wireless microphone and the aplomb of
a television talk show host, the audience _ about evenly divided
between supporters and opponents of impeachment _ responded
enthusiastically, with more than 400 speaking. Many broke into
jeers or boos _ or even hoots when some of the racier aspects of
the Monica Lewinsky affair were mentioned. Several also waved
placards stating slogans such as ``Impeach Clinton The Liar'' or
``Vote No.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the short speeches were impassioned, although sometimes
muddled, pleas to impeach or not to impeach, invoking everyone from
Solomon to Nixon to Machiavelli to Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lying under oath to a grand jury, to the American people, is
indeed a high crime and misdemeanor,'' said Victor Kotiadis, 73, a
retiree from Trumbull, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Debra Haffner of Norwalk said she came to the meeting to
``encourage Chris Shays to stay the course and oppose
impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want Monica Lewinsky broadcast into my home for the
next nine months,'' Ms. Haffner added. She said she wanted her
congressman `to stand up to Gingrich and Livingston'' and
conservative Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want him to vote his conscience,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Newman, who lives in nearby Westport, said he might have
addressed the crowd, but he could not get into the main auditorium.
``I didn't give up my citizenship when I became an actor,'' Newman
said from the city hall lobby. He added that he opposed
impeachment. ``I don't think this is what the framers of the
Constitution had in mind when they said `high crimes and
misdemeanors,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shays, 53, a moderate Republican first elected in 1987, said he
began thinking about whether he should reconsider his opposition to
impeachment after talking with Lowell Weicker, the former
Connecticut senator and governor, who was a prominent member of the
Watergate hearings and supports the impeachment of President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have the certainty that I did a week ago,'' Shays told
the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman's office said it had received 14,000 e-mails
over the weekend about the impeachment issue. And on Monday, 1,060
calls came into Shays' office. Fifty-two percent supported
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, a heavy but uncounted number of calls came into Shays'
Bridgeport office and were running about 60 percent against
impeachment, he added.
</P>
<P>
   That division was quite apparent in the remarks at the town
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Morris, 16, of Greenwich, said: ``President Clinton is an
American citizen and should be treated as one, and lying in front
of a grand jury is a crime. And therefore, he should be impeached,
without a doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Manning, 54, said ``We should look at him,'' referring to
Clinton, ``as we look at ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Shays, who kept the town meeting going until late in the night,
said he would digest what he had heard and not divulge how he would
vote.

<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ In what was billed as ``an old-fashioned New
England town hall meeting,'' a group of academics and Democratic
lawmakers rallied to President Clinton's defense at Harvard
University Tuesday night, urging Americans to take a stand against
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Martin Meehan and Edward Markey, both Massachusetts
Democrats, were joined by the Harvard professors Cornel West, Alan
Dershowitz and Phillip Heyman; former Labor Secretary Robert Reich,
and others in condemning the Republican Party for its drive to
impeach the president.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., a member of the House Judiciary
Committee, told the rally by phone that ``today we begin an effort
to repudiate the right wing and to take back the country from this
small, angry, hateful group.''
</P>
<P>
   Markey said: ``Today GOP stands for `get our president.'''
</P>
<P>
   About 500 students, faculty members and others packed the
Science Center auditorium while a few hundred more listened to
loudspeakers outside. Some carried pro-Clinton signs while others
had banners that read, ``Impeach the liar.''
</P>
<P>
   Reich, now a professor at Brandeis University, stood before a
banner that read ``Listen to the people'' and urged voters to hold
Republicans accountable for allowing an impeachment when they are
up for re-election in two years.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton was not spared from attack by the speakers. Robert
Brustein, the artistic director of the American Repertory Theater,
upbraided the president for his domestic policies and his personal
infidelities, but saw no legal basis for an impeachment. Brustein
said, ``Perhaps President Clinton should tattoo a scarlet letter
onto his forehead and get back to work.''

SCHOLARS REQUEST ALGER HISS GRAND JURY RECORDS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fifty years after Alger Hiss was indicted for perjury
in an espionage case that stirred fears that Communists had
infiltrated the federal government, a group of scholars asked a
federal judge in Manhattan on Tuesday to unseal the grand jury
records in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The petition not only seeks to shed light on one of the most
divisive issues of the Cold War, it is also aims to establish a
legal precedent that would allow for the release of secret grand
jury testimony in certain investigations of historical importance.
</P>
<P>
   The historians requesting access to the Hiss records said that
despite new disclosures from American and Soviet archives, the New
York grand jury materials remain one of the last significant
repositories of secret information about the case.
</P>
<P>
   Hiss, a former State Department official, was convicted of
perjury in 1950 for lying about whether he passed secrets to
Whittaker Chambers, an agent of the Soviet Union. He served 44
months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The historians seeking the grand jury evidence said that the
materials, only parts of which have become public, could shed light
on Hiss' activities and those of his opponents, including Richard
Nixon, then a congressman, who testified before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The historians called their effort bipartisan, and cited wide
support, including the backing of Hiss' son, writer Tony Hiss, and
critics, like William F. Buckley Jr., the editor and columnist who
was a friend of Chambers, Hiss' chief accuser.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father believed that vindication would come to him only
when ever fact was spread out in front of everyone,'' Tony Hiss
said at a news conference Tuesday, adding that his father had tried
for years to have the materials made public, and that he was
confident the records would support his father's innocence. Alger
Hiss died in 1996 at age 92.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley, speaking by phone later Tuesday, said he agreed there
was ``a legitimate historical interest'' in making the records
public, but said they would add only ``historical embellishments''
to the case.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley said in a court submission that he thought Chambers
would have supported release of the grand jury records, ``as they
would present all the evidence upon which the grand jury relied in
indicting Hiss, and would provide another counterpoint to what
Chambers believed were the false and incomplete accounts of the
evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The group seeking the records was represented by the Public
Citizen Litigation Group, which was founded by Ralph Nader and has
been involved in other suits seeking access to government records.
</P>
<P>
   One of the group's lawyers, David Vladeck, said it hoped to
surmount the courts' reluctance to lift the veil on grand jury
secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   The group lost a similar lawsuit in a different case in 1997, he
said, but the federal appeals panel that ruled against it did lay
out certain circumstances under which such records might be made
public.
</P>
<P>
   Vladeck said the Hiss case met those standards. They included
the wide interest in the matter, the length of time since the grand
jury investigation ended and the death of most of the principals in
the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that grand jury secrecy does foster important
values,'' Vladeck said, ``but at some point those values erode and
historical interest in seeing those documents takes precedence.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan, which
opposed release of grand jury records in the 1997 case, said the
office had not yet seen the new petition and would have no comment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Those requesting the Hiss records included the American
Historical Association, American Society of Legal History,
Organization of American Historians and Society of American
Archivists.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Hiss said records are being sought from the FBI and the
House Committee on Un-American Activities.
</P>
<P>
   One scholar, Sam Tanenhaus, author of ``Whittaker Chambers,''
said that the grand jury records were unlikely to exonerate Hiss,
but they might illuminate other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The records could offer a fuller account of what Hiss and
Chambers told the grand jury and present a clearer picture of the
underground Communist movement, which remains mysterious in many
respects to this day,'' said Tanenhaus, who is an editor of the
Op-Ed page of The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Weinstein, author of ``Perjury: The Hiss-Chambers Case,''
said many new details would become available should the grand jury
materials be opened.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as to whether this is going to somehow transform our
understanding of the case, I think the answer would be no,'' he
said.

   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Concluding that big-league status was worth an
expensive gamble, the Connecticut General Assembly voted Tuesday
night to build a $375 million stadium for the New England Patriots
in downtown Hartford and committed millions more to help fill it
with fans.
</P>
<P>
   The approval came after eight hours of debate during a one-day
special session, with opponents complaining that the bill had been
rushed and that crucial details remained unknown. Gov. John G.
Rowland has said he wil sign the bill in the next several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will give Hartford one of 31 National Football League
franchises, which even local boosters had considered to be a pipe
dream just a month ago. ``This will change the landscape of
Hartford and the way we look at our capital city for the rest of
our lives,'' Rowland declared.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved the measure by a 97-49 vote, and the Senate
followed with a 27-8 vote. Rowland, a Republican, got solid support
from his own party, while Democrats were divided.
</P>
<P>
   Several leading sports economists said the package was
unnecessarily generous to the Patriots and constituted the most
lucrative lease ever won by the owner of a professional team. In
Tuesday's debate, opponents worried that the stadium would tie
legislators' hands for years to come and load more debt onto a
state with a below-average credit rating.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the fleecing of Connecticut,'' said state Rep. John
Wayne Fox, a Democrat from Stamford. ``It is unconscionable that we
would incur this unknown expense. We don't have answers to our
liability, to certain basic questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who favored the stadium countered that it was a chance to
transform Hartford's blighted riverfront and generate excitement in
the city, the nation's insurance capital, which has had little to
cheer for in the decades that manufacturing plants have been moving
out and corporations have been consolidating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sends a message to out-of-state businesses that Hartford is
not a city that's going to lay down and die,'' Rep. Edward C.
Graziani, a Democrat from Ellington, said during Tuesday's debate.
``You will have tens of millions of people seeing on their screen
the city of Hartford.''
</P>
<P>
   A group of House Democrats failed in their effort to retain the
rights to sell the stadium's name, which will go to the Patriots
and can be worth tens of millions of dollars. ``We are funding the
stadium 100 percent, but we're not recognizing any of the
benefits,'' said Rep. Stephen Dargan.
</P>
<P>
   Renee A. Boicourt, managing director for state ratings at
Moody's Investors Service, said the vote moved Connecticut in the
opposite direction of many states during the current economic boom
by adding debt instead of paying it. ``This move will compound an
already weak financial picture, and take away some of the long-term
upside potential,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, the state will build an open-air stadium on
the Connecticut River and provide it to the team rent free for 30
years. The team is assured a profit by a provision that requires
the state to pay as much as $13 million a year if luxury seats or
suites go unsold.
</P>
<P>
   State budget officials estimate that, considering inflation,
those guarantees will amount to $1 billion over the 30 years of the
lease. But the state and Patriots owner Robert Kraft have vowed to
work together to sell the seats so that few, if any, guarantees
will ever have to be paid.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium, which will have 68,000 seats and a grass field, is
supposed to be ready by the fall of 2001, but state officials have
told the Patriots that the completion date could well slip by a
season. The stadium, which will be shared with the University of
Connecticut, will provide a centerpiece for a long-dreamed-of
development known as Adriaen's Landing, which is to include a
hotel, shops and a convention center.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Connecticut officials had feared that they were being
used as a bargaining chip by Kraft, who had spent years trying to
negotiate a subsidy for a new stadium from the Massachusetts
legislature. But Kraft said Tuesday that he would not give
Massachusetts a chance to match the Connecticut offer. ``If it's
passed, we're coming,'' he said Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The project faces several more hurdles. A steam plant is now on
the land and moving it could cost as much as $100 million _ none of
which is included in the budget for the stadium. The ground is also
contaminated with coal tar left over from a gas plant that operated
there from the late 1800s until 1950.

COLTS vs. GIANTS, DEC. 28, 1958: THE MOST IMPORTANT GAME EVER? 
 (bl) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The National Football League calls it the Greatest
Game Ever Played. Wellington Mara, an owner of the New York Giants
then and now, said Pete Rozelle, later the NFL commissioner,
``always told me that the reason pro football took off was because
that game happened just at that time, in that season, and it
happened in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Frank, a television executive, said, ``It was the moment
when sports became something the networks had to carry.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the NFL championship game on Dec. 28, 1958, a game in
which the Baltimore Colts beat the Giants, 23-17, on Alan Ameche's
1-yard plunge in sudden death. To touch off the 40th-anniversary
celebration, the NFL conducted a teleconference Tuesday with four
Hall of Fame players from that game _ Johnny Unitas and Artie
Donovan of the Colts, and Frank Gifford and Sam Huff of the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Their hourlong byplay sounded like four guys standing around a
bar remembering the good old days. Not all seemed convinced it was
the best football game ever played.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played better games,'' Unitas said. ``We came back once
from 28-7 at halftime against San Francisco and scored 28 points
and beat them. But I think this game accelerated football into what
it is now. It was going to happen anyway, but the way the game was
tied and then with the first overtime ever played, all the things
added up.''
</P>
<P>
   As Gifford recalled: ``It was a great game and had a lot of
drama to it. It brought great focus to pro football that wasn't
there before. And maybe it had the best personnel ever accumulated
on a football field at once until that time.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, 12 players and three coaches in that game were elected
to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The players are Unitas, Donovan,
Gino Marchetti, Raymond Berry, Jim Parker and Lenny Moore of the
Colts, and Gifford, Huff, Roosevelt Brown, Andy Robustelli, Emlen
Tunnell and Don Maynard of the Giants. The coaches are Weeb Ewbank,
the Colts' head coach, and Vince Lombardi and Tom Landry, the
Giants' coordinators.
</P>
<P>
   Tunnell, Ewbank and Lombardi are dead. The 12 others are being
invited to take part in the coin flip for next month's Super Bowl
XXXIII.
</P>
<P>
   Huff's memories of the game are not that fond. For him, the
villain was the 25-year-old Unitas, a quarterback two years removed
from the Pittsburgh sandlots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnny knew where to attack,'' Huff said. ``He found the
weakness in our defense and exploited it to perfection. It was
Unitas to Berry, Unitas to Berry. After 40 years, that still rings
in my ears. Unitas to Berry.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss was doubly disappointing, Huff said, ``because it was a
championship game and I needed the cash.''
</P>
<P>
   Each winning player earned $4,718.77, each losing player
$3,111.33. And the post-game celebration was modest, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see guys pouring champagne over each other now,'' Donovan
said. ``You know what we had? Orange soda. A lot of us went through
a war, and we get orange soda.''
</P>
<P>
   They also got a piece of history. Gifford said the game brought
tremendous attention to professional football. Huff said it helped
bring recognition to the defenses. Donovan called it ``a game that
put the NFL on the way to bigger and better things.''
</P>
<P>
   Others remembered the game, too. One was a 17-year-old
high-school player named Bill Parcells, who slipped away from a
skating party on Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey and sat in a car for
three hours listening to the game.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Bert Bell, the NFL commissioner, had tears in
his eyes because he knew what this event would mean to his sport.
Buzz Nutter, the Colts' center, chased a security guard to retrieve
the game ball and presented it to Marchetti, who broke his right
leg in the fourth quarter. Ameche bolted from the locker room to
appear for $500 that night on ``The Ed Sullivan Show.''
</P>
<P>
   The old Colts and Giants agreed that today's game was much
different. Huff, who does interview shows on radio before and after
Washington Redskins games, told this story about an off-the-air
chat with Michael Westbrook, the Redskins' 26-year-old wide
receiver:
</P>
<P>
   ``He said to me, `Hey, man, you ever play this game?' I didn't
want to show him the Hall of Fame ring on my finger, so I said,
`Michael, I played this game, and some people thought I played it
real well.'''  &QL;

JOUSTING FOR A SONG 
WEIGHTY MATTERS 
WANTED: MONICA'S DRESS
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 By JAMES BARRON WITH BRUCE LAMBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   He signed his affidavit with his full name, James Paul
McCartney.
</P>
<P>
   The former Beatle, who scribbled some of the rock era's most
famous hits in the same hard-to-read handwriting, sent his lawyers
to court hoping to force the return of the original lyric sheet for
``Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.'' He said the lyric sheet,
which has several splotchy cross-outs that suggest that McCartney
reworked the words as he was going along, had been stolen from his
house in London 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The brouhaha began in August, when a collector, Gary Zimet of
Washingtonville, N.Y., offered to sell the lyric sheet page to
McCartney for $550,000.
</P>
<P>
   Zimet denied that the lyric sheet was stolen. ``This is par for
the course,'' Zimet said. ``As a musician, he's a genius. As a
human being, he's beneath contempt. He's a $900 million dollar
gorilla throwing his weight around.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimet said he did not own the lyric sheet. He maintained that it
belonged to a collector he would not identify, adding that he had
got in touch with McCartney without telling the collector he was
doing so.
</P>
<P>
   The collector's lawyer, Peter Cane, who also refused to identify
the collector, said the collector had obtained the lyric sheet
legitimately. ``As far as I know,'' Cane said, ``the first claim he
made that it was stolen was after he was alerted to how much it was
worth.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer representing McCartney, Alan Friedman of Manhattan,
did not return a call seeking comment.

   Mayoral Diet Tips
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is continuing what might be
called a City Hall tradition of diet consciousness. After all, Ed
Koch appeared in commercials for the diet drink Ultra Slim-Fast
(though not until after his term was over).
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Giuliani said he had lost 28 pounds in the last four
months.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor made the disclosure in response to a question from
Rafael Martinez Alequin, a regular at City Hall news briefings who
publishes a newspaper called The Free Press. Martinez observed that
the mayor appeared to have lost weight, and asked if he was
slimming down in preparation for running for something.
</P>
<P>
   And he did not mean next year's New York City Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The diet's great,'' the mayor declared. ``I may write a book
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Diet? What diet? Pritikin or Scarsdale, perhaps, or Bronx? Or
Weight Watchers or Jenny Craig?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicken, fish, lots of salad,'' he said. ``Limit the amount of
bread you eat.''
</P>
<P>
   No pizza? ``Well,'' the mayor acknowledged, ``every once in a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   Pasta? ``Every once in a while, but not too much,'' Giuliani
said, ``and exercise every morning for about 20 minutes or a
half-hour.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not elaborate on what kind of exercise he favored. Nor
would aides say what his weight and height are these days.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit A, Maybe
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was inevitable: Someone wants to buy the notorious Gap
dress that Monica Lewinsky turned over to the Whitewater
independent counsel, Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Rosalie Osias, a Long Island lawyer, said she wanted the dress _
and the T-shirt the president brought back from the Black Dog
restaurant on Martha's Vineyard _ for a traveling exhibit
``dedicated to showing the realities of women in the 20th-century
workplace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that we preserve the historical record intact,
especially from Monica's point of view,'' said Ms. Osias, adding
that her Osias Foundation had given Ms. Lewinsky $10,000 several
months ago when one of Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers appealed for
contributions.

ALUMINUM BATS FACE REVISIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The ``ping'' that has defined college baseball for 24
years may endure for another season after an NCAA committee Tuesday
came to a different conclusion about the future of aluminum bats
than other members of the governing body.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA Championship/Competition Cabinet voted to decrease the
diameter of aluminum bats and reduce the length-to-width
differential for the 1999 postseason. But it opted not to limit
batted ball exit speed as suggested by the Division I baseball
committee, a proposal that bat manufacturers insisted would render
them incapable of creating an acceptable product in time for the
postseason and force a return by college teams to wooden bats.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA says balls coming off aluminum bats achieve such speed
_ up to 113 mph _ that they are dangerous, especially to pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``On that point, we were uncomfortable setting that standard,''
said Jean Lenti Ponsetto, the cabinet's chairwoman and senior
associate athletic director at DePaul. ``But we still feel we're
minimizing the risk for the student-athlete. And that was our
priority.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee voted to decrease bat diameter from 2} inches to
2| and reduce length-to-width differential from five to three. In
other words, a 34-inch bat could be no lighter than 31 ounces, a
change that would reduce bat speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the best compromise,'' ASU Coach Pat Murphy said.
``It was their way of saying, `Let's show our interest in making
the game more safe.' I think eventually you'll see the bats play
more like wood and have the game the way it was meant to be
played.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision now goes to the Executive Committee, which is one
of numerous committees to attack the issues in the past five
months. A verdict is expected soon because most teams open formal
workouts in less than three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA said it initiated bat standard changes because of
concern for player safety, but the integrity of the game also has
come under scrutiny. Sixty-two home runs were hit in this year's
College World Series, 14 more than the previous record. ASU lost to
Southern California, 21-14, in the title game.
</P>
<P>
   The future of the bats beyond the 1999 postseason is
undetermined.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Executive Committee's decision will not impact the
regular season, it likely will prompt moves by individual
conferences. The Pac-10 Conference Council already forwarded a
proposal on bat standards for the 1999 regular season to the
league's chief executive officers on the heels of the NCAA's
decision. The proposal is similar to the NCAA
Championship/Competition Cabinet's suggestions, plus it states that
league teams shall use only aluminum bats by companies that will
provide to the league ``a defense and indemnification from
lawsuits.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have spent an exhaustive amount of time on this,'' Pac-10
Commissioner Tom Hansen said. ``Because of the legal issues, we
have had long conversations with manufacturers, coaches, lawyers
and officials at each university.''
</P>
<P>
   Money and legalities are as much at the heart of this issue as
anything.
</P>
<P>
   The return to wooden bats, which still is a possibility, would
hit coaches hard. About 150 Division I coaches are under contract
to bat companies, which pay them up to $80,000 and provide free
aluminum bats to their teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do a lot for our programs and do a lot for our coaches,''
Murphy said. ``We probably wouldn't all be under contract with
woods because the wooden bat market is the pros, and the aluminum
bat market is college baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy admitted the possible return to wooden bats has made him
``take a good, hard look at what I'm doing, and the reasons I feel
the way I do about wooden bats. Is it money? Or is it the game? The
integrity of the game is what should matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Easton Sports, one of the two biggest manufacturers of aluminum
bats, is suing the NCAA for $267 million, alleging restraint of
trade. Chairman Jim Easton was in Europe on Tuesday and could not
be reached for comment. &QL; 
Cedric Dempsey, NCAA executive director, has alerted university
executives to potential legal risk if they use the previously
allowed bats this season. &QL;

COYOTES MAKE FINAL APPEAR ANCE AT GAR DENS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ One by one, they have toppled like a house of cards,
historical landmarks that painted indelible memories for one
generation to the next and so on, plowed away, stripped down and
forgotten in the name of progress, luxury suites and revenue
streams.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL has said goodbye to many of its famous old arenas in
recent years. See ya, Chicago Stadium. Later, Boston Garden. Adieu,
The Forum in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Coyotes will pay their final visit and respects to
the great Maple Leaf Gardens, the oldest remaining hockey building
in the league, when they meet the Toronto Maple Leafs at 5:30 p.m.
The Maple Leafs are moving out of the 68-year-old building later
this season to play in a new arena several blocks away called the
Air Canada Centre.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be tough, there's a ton of history in that
place,'' said Coyotes forward Keith Tkachuk, who might not even be
able to play because of slight groin pull. ``All the old buildings
are coming down, though, and this is the last one. It's a little
sad.''
</P>
<P>
   The fabled Gardens, which opened its doors on Nov. 12, 1931 _ a
2-1 Toronto loss to the visiting Chicago Blackhawks _ will close on
Feb. 13. Ironically, Chicago will be the visitor in the final game.
Ticket scalpers reportedly are getting as much as $5,000 a seat for
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Nikolai Khabibulin and Jimmy Waite, the Coyotes' two goalies,
wanted to draw straws for the honor to get today's semi-historical
start. Alas, Coach Jim Schoenfeld isn't one to let his goalies make
those decisions. He will go with Khabibulin, who has stopped 75 of
the past 77 shots he has faced in his past two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most famous building left in the NHL,'' said
Khabibulin, who is 9-5-1 with a 2.22 goals-against average lifetime
against the Maple Leafs. ``I've always loved playing there. The
fans are so close to you, so loud, and the boards there seem to
make everything faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Just about everyone on the Coyotes has a favorite story or
special moment about Maple Leaf Gardens. From rookie Bryan Helmer,
who as a kid, used to take a train here from his small hometown
outside of Ottawa to come watch the Maple Leafs play the Canadiens.
To veteran Jyrki Lumme, who first skated on the arena's ice as a
teenager for Finland in the 1986 Junior World Championships.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Simmer, the Coyotes' color commentator on television
broadcasts, said he had one of his best and one of his worst
experiences in The Grand Ol' Dame during his illustrious NHL
playing career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played there when I was in juniors with Sault Ste. Marie,''
Simmer, 43, said, ``and when I turned pro the next year, I was able
to get in there in my third game and score a goal, get an assist
and get a second star award. Growing up in Canada, to skate out
after the game for a second star, or any star at all, was something
I'll never forget. I was shaking for days after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Simmer, who hails from nearby Terrace Bay, Ontario, won't forget
another particular moment here some years later. He entered that
particular game with 56 goals under his belt with a month and a
half remaining in the season. That night, he broke his leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I walk into that building now, I look just inside
the blue line and go, `A lot of pain happened right there,' ''
Simmer said. ``It had been such a good year for me up to that
night. It was disappointing that way in that it took me at least
three years to get back to form. That was the downside, but just to
get in there and play that one game and to skate out for a second
star one time, I could have quit right after that.''
</P>
<P>
   What if ``that'' had been the night he shattered his leg?
</P>
<P>
   ``I still would have walked out there for that second star _
without crutches, too,'' he said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Waite's fondest memory of the Gardens had nothing to do with
hockey at all. It happened a year ago, on Nov. 8, and he spent most
of the game in the visitor's locker room talking on a cell phone to
someone thousands of miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the night my son (Brendon) was born,'' Waite said.
``We were playing here and I couldn't get home, and since I wasn't
playing, I spent most of my time in the dressing room talking to
(wife) Nancy while she was in labor.''
</P>
<P>
   Brendon arrived about an hour after the game, while Waite and
the rest of the Coyotes were on a bus ride to the Toronto airport
for a flight back to Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been there many times and played a few games in that
building, and it's one of the greatest places to play,'' Waite
said, ``but that night will still always be my best memory of Maple
Leaf Gardens.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine how center Jeremy Roenick must feel. The former Chicago
Blackhawk has had some of his finest moments ever at Maple Leaf
Gardens. His 36 goals and 74 points against the Maple Leafs are by
far his most against any other NHL team. He also recorded his first
career hat trick here nine years ago this month. And today,
appropriately enough, will mark his 700th career NHL game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be fun,'' Roenick said. ``Hopefully, I can do
big things like I have there in recent years. I'll miss that
building probably more than I'll miss any building.''
</P>
<P>
   More than old Chicago Stadium, where he was the last Blackhawk
to score a goal?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, no,'' Roenick said. ``I was going to say, `Except for
Chicago Stadium.'' &QL;

<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Cardinals Coach Vince Tobin used to jog until bad
knees forced him to quit.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he rides a stationary bike, not just to keep a boyish
figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good therapy to get the poison out of your system,''
Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin, 55, is under a lot of stress these days as the Cardinals
(7-7) try to reach the NFC playoffs for the first time in a
non-strike season since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   He was just arriving for work Monday morning when Atlanta
Falcons Coach Dan Reeves, 54, checked into a hospital because of
heart problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hits home,'' Tobin said. ``Here's a guy who was very
healthy, very vibrant, coaching one day, and the next day, he's at
the hospital getting ready for an operation for four bypasses. It
puts you back to reality. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``You are well aware that it can strike you very quickly. Life
can change very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten years earlier, Tobin became interim coach of the Chicago
Bears when Coach Mike Ditka suffered a mild heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin will meet Ditka's New Orleans Saints on Sunday at Sun
Devil Stadium in the most meaningful game the Cardinals have played
since moving to Arizona in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Ditka began feeling poorly after working out at the Bears' Lake
Forest, Ill., practice facility on Nov. 2, 1988. The team had just
come off a 30-7 loss at New England.
</P>
<P>
   Paramedics were called, and Ditka was taken in an ambulance to a
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike always worked out,'' Tobin said. ``He took it to a point
where he you would think he was dying, he worked out so hard. He
had a rubber sweat suit he used to wear. He used to drive himself.
He was obsessive in the way he did things.''
</P>
<P>
   (Ditka didn't lose his sense of humor. He told former teammate
Ed O'Bradovich after the heart attack, ``Damn, I thought I was
going to die, and I hadn't gotten my hole-in-one yet.'')
</P>
<P>
   Tobin, defensive coordinator of the Bears at the time, was put
in charge and ran the Bears for two games, guiding them to
victories over Tampa Bay and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Former St. Louis Rams Coach Rich Brooks, now defensive
coordinator of the Falcons, will guide the team in Reeves' absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rich has been a head coach,'' Tobin said. ``For me, it was
uncharted waters. I never dreamed I would be named (interim coach).
There were a lot of coaches on that staff who had been there a lot
longer than I had been.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to bring to the fore what your strengths and
attributes are. But you know it's on an interim basis, so you don't
throw out the baby with the bathwater, so to speak. It's your job
to do the things you think are necessary to give you the best
chance of winning because it's your ship you are steering at that
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ditka was in intensive care when the Bears, under Tobin, beat
the Buccaneers. Ditka was on the sidelines the next week in
Washington but sat on the bench and didn't get involved in
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin said he doesn't fear that he could suffer a similar fate
of Ditka and Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   He works out two to three times a week, lifting weights and
riding the stationary bike.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps (combat) stress, and he does his workouts
religiously,'' said Cardinals trainer John Omohundro, who has been
with the team for 32 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, Cardinals defensive coordinator Chuck Drulis
suffered a fatal heart attack on the team's chartered plane flight
from St. Louis to Houston. The plane made an emergency stop in
Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Now, team medical officials carry a defibrillator and a cardiac
crash kit on the plane for such emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think coaches are different than other people in
high-pressure situations in regular society,'' Omohundro said.
``The thing that's beneficial is they work in an area in which they
are subjected to a lot of opportunities to work out and have some
level of physical fitness.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals require their coaches to have an annual physical
examination. As part of that exam, the coaches take cardiac stress
tests and have their blood fat and cholesterol levels checked.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin, whose team has played seven games that have been decided
by four points or less, said he is able to get over tough losses
fairly quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a pretty good way of enjoying the moment the night of
the game,'' he said. ``The next morning, you still are hanging over
from it a little bit, but I can get rid of it and go on to the next
(game). Some people have a hard time ever turning loose a game that
it lost in the last few seconds. I've really never had that
problem. I'm ready to go to the next game.'' &QL;

THE MELLOWING OF MIKE  
 DITKA SUCCEEDS AFTER GETTING HANDLE ON SELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS - Here in the Big Hangover, in a city where you can
find anything and most of it trouble, the face of football has
changed.
</P>
<P>
   It happened long after the heart attack that sidelined him for,
oh, seven days. After he threw his gum at a fan in San Francisco.
After inviting Doug Flutie to Thanksgiving dinner, infuriating the
rest of his team. After foolishly siding with his replacement
players during the 1987 strike. After challenging a listener to a
fight during his weekly radio show, issuing his address over the
air.
</P>
<P>
   It happened long after he started opening beer bottles with his
teeth. After climbing into the stands trying to attack a heckler in
Tampa. After publicly humiliating Jim Harbaugh on the sidelines in
Minnesota. After selling his image to every taker, and inevitably,
buying it himself.
</P>
<P>
   And it happened shortly after paying off a bet on the sidelines.
After lambasting his new city for its lack of hygiene. After a
roller-coaster debut season in which he wept in his wife's arms
after a loss, threatening to surrender before the season was over.
</P>
<P>
   But it happened.
</P>
<P>
   After 11 years in Chicago, where Mike Ditka was more myth than
reality, after taking a job that had people questioning his sanity,
Ditka is revealing the fiber lining the legend. And across the
country, people are raving about the job he's done resurrecting the
New Orleans Saints.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very sympathetic,'' Ditka said with a gleam in his
eyes. ``They know I'm getting old and weary. That I'll be done one
of these days and they want to say he was a good chap.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it's something different.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things have changed in his heart,'' Saints
quarterback Danny Wuerffel said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Ditka will bring his Saints to Sun Devil Stadium.
They are 6-8, an average team with no offense, yet a team still
alive in the playoff hunt. They play hard and with enthusiasm.
Their defense is in constant attack mode and has scored eight
touchdowns. They are the only NFL team to have never won a playoff
game, but suddenly, there is a future. And much of it comes from
Ditka, who is producing his best season ever as head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in it,'' Ditka said. ``If we win two games, we
might be in it. We've got to win this football game. That's all
that counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, something has changed. Ditka is 59, in the autumn of life,
and there is much fodder for the reincarnation. His father died in
November. He is now deeply religious, and after every home game
last season, he would drive 30 miles to a seminary and pray. He no
longer yells at players in public. He's sworn off swearing and
alcohol, and any time he breaks his new vow, he contributes money
to a special fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been pretty good,'' Ditka said. ``I might say heck or
darn once in a while, but I don't say very much. I gave them a
couple of bucks early in the year because I said a couple of
things. But the word I've tried to stop saying, I've stopped
saying.''
</P>
<P>
   And now he is coaching with great maturity and perspective.
Spreading his will and belief without letting his intensity
scramble the signal. He is in control of his team because he's in
control of himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see someone that's intense and competitive,'' Wuerffel said.
``That isn't going to change because that gives him the edge. But
what people don't see is a guy who has really got a big heart. A
guy who is extremely loyal and fair, and extremely compassionate,
believe it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   There is another reason, too, and it's probably the biggest
trigger in the return to prominence. It's called denial, and five
years after a painful termination to an act gone stale, Ditka is
finally over the Bears.
</P>
<P>
   See, it didn't matter that he should've won multiple Super Bowls
in Chicago, that he dramatically underachieved with great talent,
that from 1984-91 his regular season record was 90-37 while his
playoff mark was a suspicious 6-6. Or, by his own admission, how
anyone could've coached the Bears to a title in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Point is, he was handpicked by George Halas, thereby directly
linked to the origin of the game. He was everything Chicago craved
in a football coach, from the bravado to the mouth that roared. He
was the tough kid from Pennsylvania, son of a railroad worker, the
coach who pulled no punches yet was more than willing to throw a
few. He even looked like a bear, eerily resembling the team logo.
</P>
<P>
   For over a decade, he was king. He was Chicago. And to lose all
of that was more painful than he ever realized.
</P>
<P>
   It is why he took four years off, refusing to interview for
jobs. Why he was an emotional wreck in his rookie season with New
Orleans. Why his wife threw out a room full of priceless
memorabilia last fall _ including the game plan from Super Bowl XX,
the one Ditka had in his hand as he was carried off the field _ and
ordered a trash collector to take it all away.
</P>
<P>
   (The stunned garbage man did just that. He took it right to an
auctioneer, who began selling the items via catalog.)
</P>
<P>
   And it is why, as recently as last summer, Ditka trashed New
Orleans in a ``Sports Illustrated'' cover story, calling the city
``filthy,'' and how he cut short his only visit to Bourbon Street
because he ``couldn't stand the riot of drunks spilling out of
nightclubs and strip joints.''
</P>
<P>
   It is why the mayor of New Orleans responded with the obvious,
that Ditka was homesick for Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   But somewhere along the line, that changed. Ditka finally let go
of the past and embraced the new challenge. He signed a five-year
extension in August. He's committed himself to the Saints, to
finishing what he started.
</P>
<P>
   For all his tough talk, it took a while, longer than he
realized. But Ditka is finally liberated from the baggage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other colors don't look like they ever belonged to me,''
Ditka said. ``That's the way I feel. I want to prove to the people
of New Orleans that I am them.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Ditka is now a Saint. In more ways than anyone ever thought
possible. &QL;

LOS ANGELES TIMES TO LAY OFF 500
</HEADLINE>
 
(Changes wording in 12th paragraph for clarification.) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Moving in the ``a'' national news file, the ``f'' financial news
file and in the ``n'' California news file.) 
By GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Admitting it is trailing other newspapers in eight
of 11 Southern California markets, the Los Angeles Times said
Tuesday that it will fire 500 employees and reorganize its local
operations into four regions.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper, a unit of L.A.-based Times Mirror Co., has
slashed 750 jobs, or about 12 percent of its work force, since
early November in response to shrinking profits and disappointing
ad revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The Times said yet another round of cost reductions will be
announced before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Times is currently the No. 2 paper ... here, a situation
that we must reverse,'' said Kathryn Downing, the paper's president
and chief executive officer. ``To become the No. 1 paper, we need a
nimble, decentralized organization in each of our diverse regions
that can compete more effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's cuts, announced 10 days before Christmas and during
Hanukkah, are concentrated in the paper's business units, including
380 telemarketing jobs eliminated in its circulation department.
Other firings were in the Times' finance, human resources and
administrative services divisions.
</P>
<P>
   The total of 500 cuts comprises 130 full-time and 370 part-time
positions. They amount to about 8 percent of the paper's payroll.
</P>
<P>
   No positions were eliminated in the news department during this
round of cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unfortunate time because we are disrupting people
during the holidays and we are disrupting families during the
holidays, and I would prefer it not be at this time,'' Downing
said.
</P>
<P>
   The paper's new strategy calls for creating two new regions for
business purposes: Los Angeles and the Inland Empire/San Gabriel
Valley region. The Times now has Orange County and San Fernando
Valley/Ventura County regions.
</P>
<P>
   Downing said the paper's regular metro edition will continue to
be included in the new regions' editions while management decides
whether to offer readers a regionalized news product similar to
those produced for the Valley and Ventura and Orange counties.
</P>
<P>
   Full-time employees being fired will receive 18 weeks to two
years of pay, depending on their length of service, while part-time
workers will get from 12 to 18 weeks of pay.
</P>
<P>
   Times Mirror will take a charge of up to $225 million this year
to pay for corporatewide restructurings, including those at the
Times. Its stock closed Tuesday at $55.25, up 6.25 cents. The cuts
were announced after the markets closed.
</P>
<P>
   The firings come a week after the company announced it was
giving $1 million to Columbia University's Graduate School of
Journalism to fund a visiting professorship to study diversity in
media issues.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper spokesman Mike Lang said the paper also is planning to
introduce up to 12 Our Times community news editions next year
throughout Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper industry analyst John Morton said large newspapers
like the Times ``are trying to both broaden and deepen their
franchise, and one way to do that is create regional or zoned
editions and attempt to be more than just the big metro paper.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Times Mirror has shed assets to focus on its
newspapers, which include The Baltimore Sun and Newsday on Long
Island, N.Y. But high costs and a soft advertising market,
particularly for classified ads, have led to reduced expectations
for the company and a 10percent decline in its stock.
</P>
<P>
   Downing said it is critical to cut costs wherever possible to
improve the bottom line.

GAME'S IMPORTANCE OUTWEIGHS INJURIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - The availability of several Cardinals' injured
players could be affected by the enormous stakes of this week's
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are ready to help us, we certainly will use them,''
Cardinals Coach  &UR; Vince Tobin said. ``There is no sense saving them
for the dance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals enter Sunday's game against New Orleans trying to
secure an NFC wild-card playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   They hope to get the return of middle linebacker  &UR; Ronald
McKinnon (knee), cornerback  &UR; Tom Knight (hamstring) and defensive
tackle  &UR; Mark Smith (ankle).
</P>
<P>
   In addition, offensive guard  &UR; Matt Joyce and running back
 &UR; Michael Pittman will try to practice today despite still not being
fully recovered from broken hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going to practice with a ball (cast) on their
hands,'' Tobin said. ``We will have to determine whether they can
help us playing one-handed.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyce hasn't played since Nov. 15 against Dallas. Pittman
suffered his injury 10 days ago against the New York Giants.
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon has been out for the past two games. Knight has missed
three straight games, and Smith sat out last week's 20-17 overtime
victory at Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon and Smith likely could start if they are healthy.
Knight would play behind rookie cornerback  &UR; Corey Chavous, who has
started three consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to risk their health if they come back and play
before they are ready,'' Tobin said. ``We need to see if they can
play better (in their condition) than the guys who have been
playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can't run or move, no matter how willing the heart is,
I don't know how much they could help us.'' &QL; 
Elite company
</P>
<P>
   Running back  &UR; Adrian Murrell needs only 48 rushing yards in the
next two games to become the eighth active player to gain 1,000
yards in three or more consecutive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's  &UR; Barry Sanders has done it 10 consecutive years, two
more than Dallas'  &UR; Emmitt Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Three players _  &UR; Terrell Davis of the Denver Broncos,  &UR; Curtis
Martin of the New York Jets and  &UR; Ricky Watters of the Seattle
Seahawks _ have rushed for more than 1,000 yards the past four
years.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jamal Anderson of Atlanta and  &UR; Eddie George of Tennessee have
broke the 1,000 barrier each of the past three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Murrell has gained 952 yards and six touchdowns on 237 carries. &QL; 
Little pressure
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have gone without a sack in their past two games.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin thinks that's related to the struggle their injury-riddled
defense has had in stopping the run.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're holding for life trying to stop the run, it's hard
to rush the passer,'' Tobin said. &QL; 
Short shots
</P>
<P>
   Ticket sales for Sunday's game have been steady the past two
days, but the team had sold only 38,396 as of early afternoon
Tuesday, more than 34,000 shy of a sellout.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the second week of the season, the
Cardinals aren't in the plus-category in turnover ratio. An
interception and lost fumble against the Eagles dropped them to
even. They have 33 takeaways and 33 giveaways.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver  &UR; Frank Sanders has dropped out of the NFC lead in
receptions. He has 71, two behind leader Jerry Rice of San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals are ranked 15th in the NFL on offense and 19th on
defense.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans is 29th on offense, 30th in rushing. They are 27th
on defense, last against the pass. &QL;
