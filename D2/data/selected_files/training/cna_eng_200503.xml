TAIWANESE GROUPS IN CANADA VOICE OPPOSITION TO ANTI-SECESSION LAW

<TEXT>
<P>
Two Taiwanese groups in Ottawa and Montreal
issued a joint declaration Monday, strongly protesting against
Beijing's proposed anti-secession law aimed at Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the two groups of Taiwanese expatriates in
Canada urged Beijing to drop the plan immediately to help quell
tensions between Taiwan and mainland China. They also called on the
Canadian government and the international community to take concrete
measures to stop Beijing from enacting the law for the sake of peace
and security in the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the People's Republic of China has never
ruled Taiwan for a single day, and Beijing has no right to manage
Taiwan's affairs or unilaterally define Taiwan-mainland relations
through domestic legislation.
</P>
<P>
The anti-secession bill totally ignores the reality existing
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait and is contradictory to
the international understanding of the situation in the region, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Calling the proposed law a scheme to create a legal basis for the
invasion of Taiwan, the statement stressed that its enactment would
seriously damage the cross-strait status quo and greatly affect peace
and security in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The full National People's Congress -- mainland China's
rubber-stamp parliament -- is expected to pass the bill into law in
mid-March.

The smaller local enterprises, especially,

<P>
The Central Election Commission (CEC) on
Tuesday announced that the mission-oriented National Assembly
elections will be held May 14.
</P>
<P>
The polls to elect 300 delegates to the National Assembly will be
open from 7: 30 a.m. to 4 p.m. to give those taking part in a

CEC officials said.
</P>
<P>
All candidates must register with the CEC between March 26 and
30, and the list of candidates and the campaign period will be

</P>
<P>
The 300 delegates elected will be assigned exclusively for the
task of reviewing a draft package of constitutional amendment
proposals passed by the Legislative Yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
The legislature passed several constitutional amendment proposals
at an extraordinary session last August, including the halving of the

CAL, UNI AIRWAYS LAUNCH SCHEDULED TAIPEI-SEOUL FLIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Taiwan carriers -- China Airlines (CAL)
and UNI Airways -- upgraded their regular daily charter flights to
the South Korean capital of Seoul to scheduled flights Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
CAL, Taiwan's largest carrier, has operated one charter flight
between Taipei and Seoul per day since late last year. A CAL
spokesman said the airline will maintain its current one daily flight
for the time being after changing from a charter basis to a scheduled
one.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the spokesman said, the airline will replace its
B737-800 passenger plane on the Seoul route with the larger A300-600R
plane to meet market demand.
</P>
<P>
From March 28, he added, the carrier will add an additional
Taipei-Seoul flight on Mondays and Fridays.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, UNI Airways began to operate scheduled flights daily
between the southern Taiwan port city of Kaohsiung and Seoul from
Tuesday. It plans to inaugurate scheduled flights between Kaohsiung
and Jijou from March 29.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan suspended direct air links with South Korea Sept. 15,
1992, after Seoul switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to
Beijing in August of that year. Charter flights were resumed in 2003,
and the two countries finally signed a new aviation agreement in late
2004 to resume normal direct air links.
</P>
<P>
The CAL spokesman said South Koreans made a total of 8 million
overseas trips in 2004, with about 150,000 visiting Taiwan. Thanks in
part to the growing popularity of South Korean TV soap operas, Taiwan
citizens made 300,000 visits to South Korea last year.

NOTHING BEING RULED OUT ON COUNTERING ANTI-SECESSION LAW: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  1 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government will not rule out any
possibilities on countering Beijing's proposed anti-secession law
targeting Taiwan, Premier Frank Shieh said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the remarks while answering questions from Taiwan
Solidarity Union lawmaker Ho Min-ho, who asked the premier whether
the government would consider holding a defensive referendum to
counter the anti-secession bill, which is expected to be enacted in
the middle of this month.
</P>
<P>
If mainland China enacts the law, it must be held accountable for
the consequences, Hsieh said, adding that the law totally goes
against Beijing's claims of respecting the people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the government is firmly opposed to the
anti-secession law and that it will strongly voice this opposition to
the international community. He warned that complications arising
from Beijing's anti-secession law scheme will aggravate the
cross-strait situation.
</P>
<P>
Regarding a government campaign to change the official titles of
Taiwan's offices overseas and its state-run enterprises to
distinguish them from those of mainland China, the premier said that
the issue will be dealt with on a case by case basis. Relevant
government authorities will devise a set of mechanisms to serve that
end within two or three months, he added.

TRA DOES NOT RECOGNIZE TAIWAN AS PART OF CHINA: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 1 (CNA)
(By P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Tuesday that the
United States' Taiwan Relations Act does not recognize Taiwan as
being part of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Relations Act deals with Washington's unofficial
relations with Taiwan after the severance of diplomatic ties between
the two countries in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the comments while responding to questions
raised by Lin Te-fu, legislator from opposition People First Party,
in a general interpellation session at the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the views of the United States and China regarding
the one-China policy and whether enactment of China's proposed
anti-secession law will harm the climate of cross-strait
reconciliation, Hsieh said that according to his understanding, China
and the United States see the one-China policy slightly differently.
</P>
<P>
Beijing claims that Taiwan is part of China, the premier noted,
while the United States does not use the word "recognize" to describe
its stance on China's claim, and instead only uses the words
"acknowledges and respects."
</P>
<P>
The premier urged the Beijing regime to intuitively perceive
Taiwan's concern over the anti-secession bill issue and to adjust its
plan of enacting it.
</P>
<P>
The Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress
adopted in December of last year a draft of the proposed law, and the
congress is set to pass the bill into law at its annual plenary
session slated to be held in early March.
</P>
<P>
Cross-strait exchanges will be affected if China adopts the
proposed bill, Hsieh continued, adding that China should consider the
feelings of the Taiwan people. He said that the government will react
appropriately in accordance with Beijing's future actions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu said the
same day that Taiwan's current tactic is to urge friendly countries
in the international community to try to stop enactment of the law,
adding that leaders of some countries, including the United States,
have voiced their concerns about the issue.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that Taiwan has not yet considered the measures it
will take to counter the law if China enacts it, Wu said that
currently, Taiwan is doing whatever it can to try to prevent its
enactment.

<TEXT>
<P>
Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng
said Tuesday that he might run for the Kuomintang (KMT) chairmanship
if incumbent chairman Lien Chan decides not to take part in the vote
among party members.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the comments while responding to questions from local
media at the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Wang reiterated that he would consider running for the party's
highest post only if Lien eventually decides not to participate in
the race. This was the first time that Wang, a vice chairman of the
main opposition party, revealed his intent to run.
</P>
<P>
As to a media report that P. K. Chiang, currently a legislator
and also a KMT vice chairman, might also join the contest and stands
a good chance of winning, Wang claimed that he was not aware of the
matter and said that he came to learn about the issue from newspaper
reports.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, aides to Chiang said that he has no idea about all the
developments and ascribed them to media speculation.
</P>
<P>
The issue regarding the new KMT chairmanship has triggered
rampant media speculation over a fierce competition, in particular
between Wang and Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who is also a vice
chairman of the KMT.

TWO PRO-TAIWAN INDEPENDENCE PRESIDENTIAL ADVISERS QUIT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two pro-Taiwan independence advisers to
President Chen Shui-bian resigned Tuesday to show their displeasure
over the president's remarks on the nation's status during his
meeting with opposition People First Party Chairman James Soong last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Koo Kuan-min, senior adviser to the president, and Ng Chiau-tong,
national policy adviser to the president, said they were disappointed
at President Chen's joint statement with Soong in which Chen
reaffirmed his "five noes" from his first inaugural address.
</P>
<P>
The "five noes" refer to no declaration of independence, no
change of the nation's name, no inclusion of "state-to-state"
relations with mainland China in the Constitution, no referendum to
change the nation's status quo and no revocation of the National
Unification Guidelines or the National Unification Council.
</P>
<P>
In response, Presidential Office officials said they are
continuing to communicate with Koo and Ng, hoping to persuade them to
stay on.
</P>
<P>
The officials also explained that President Chen's meeting with
Soong was arranged to put an end to inter-party rivalry and
confrontation and move toward party-to-party cooperation and
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Koo announced in a news conference Tuesday that he will quit the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) as well as his post as a
senior adviser to the president.
</P>
<P>
Koo scathingly criticized the ruling DPP administration and
stressed that from now on he will dedicate himself to the promotion
of writing a new constitution for the nation and rectifying the
nation's name from the ROC to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He said that he will watch what President Chen does and that "if
he is willing to turn back, we are still partners."
</P>
<P>
He said that during his five-odd years as an adviser to the
president, he has mentioned several times to Chen that the "five
noes" would seriously undermine the existence and development of the
nation, so it was with great disappointment that he learned of the
president's reaffirmation of the "five noes" during his meeting with
Soong.
</P>
<P>
"One day the president wants to write a new constitution and the
next day he wants to amend it; this gives the public the impression
that he is constantly wavering," Koo said.
</P>
<P>
He harshly criticized Premier Frank Hsieh's remarks that he will
not forcefully promote the writing a new constitution or the
rectification of the nation's name, saying that the DPP won the right
to rule exactly because these two stances were put forward as needed
changes for the country and Hsieh shouldn't forget why they are
attractive to people.
</P>
<P>
Ng, also chairman of the World United Formosans for Independence,
sent his letter of resignation to the presidential Office Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ng said that he has not fulfilled his duty as a national policy
adviser, and that his advice to the president did not receive the
attention it deserved.
</P>
<P>
In addition, though he supported inter-party cooperation, Ng said
the president paid too high a price in issuing the 10-point joint
statement with Soong.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the pro-independence party, the Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU), said that Koo and Ng had worked with the DPP because of
their long-term dedication to creating a new constitution for the
nation and rectifying the nation's name.
</P>
<P>
Lo Chih-ming, caucus whip of the TSU in the Legislative Yuan,
said that Koo and Ng hoped that President Chen would help them
realize their ideals, but their dream was shattered after Chen's
meeting with Soong.

PREMIER DEFENDS SPECIAL NT$610.8 BILLION ARMS PROCUREMENT BUDGET
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 1 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh on Tuesday spoke in
defense of a special budget proposed by the Cabinet for a NT$610.8
billion (US$18.23 billion) arms procurement package from the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh emphasized during an interpellation session in the
Legislative Yuan that it is necessary for the government to plan a
special budget for the package, saying it will squeeze the other 204
arms procurement items covered by the regular budget if the package
is to be included in the regular budget as well.
</P>
<P>
The package includes six Patriot PAC-III anti-missile batteries,
eight diesel-fueled submarines and a squadron of 12 P-3C
anti-submarine aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said the Ministry of National Defense will step up
communication with the public to try to win their support for the
special budget.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said he understands that there is a prevailing opinion
among the public that such a large amount of money should have been
used to finance social welfare programs.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, Taiwan does not have a choice because
cross-Taiwan Strait peace does not lie unilaterally with the island,
which is targeted by more than 700 missiles deployed by mainland
China.
</P>
<P>
With the NT$610.8 billion to be spread over a 15-year period, the
annual defense budget of the country will be NT$300 billion, or 3
percent of gross domestic product (GDP) , after a NT$260 billion
defense spending package in the regular budget has been taken into
consideration, Hsieh pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Minister of National Defense Lee Jye denied reports
suggesting that the government will have to repay NT$1.2 trillion
including interest for a NT$400 billion loan to fund the special arms
package.
</P>
<P>
On issues regarding reforms to the military service system, Hsieh
said the government is planning to introduce a voluntary military
service system in parallel with the mandatory military service system
in the short run.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that a ratio of six volunteers to four conscripts
will be achieved by the year 2008, he said.

VICE DEFENSE MINISTER WELCOMES VISIT OF U.S. PROCUREMENT GROUP

<TEXT>
<P>
Vice Minister of National Defense Tsai
Ming-hsien said Tuesday the ministry welcomes a foreign procurement
group from the U.S. Department of Defense to visit Taiwan this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
Tsai was responding to media reports that the group will come to
Taiwan Saturday for a five-day visit. During their stay in Taiwan,
they will inspect the island's defense industry, meet with
officials from the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) and the
Ministry of National Defense (MND) as well as hold presentations to
brief Taiwan manufacturers on the requirements and procedures for
U.S. military procurement, the reports also said.
</P>
<P>
Tsai, speaking on the sidelines of a ceremony to honor
outstanding military units and individuals on Military Service Day,
welcomed the U.S. group, but said that the MOEA will be in charge of
the arrangement of the group's visit.
</P>
<P>
If necessary, the MND will also arrange for the group to visit
the Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology -- a military-run
research and development institute under the Armaments Bureau of the
MND.
</P>
<P>
Noting that mainland China's defense budget is growing at a
double-digit pace, Tsai said this is why the MND needs to procure
weaponry from the United States, referring to the six Patriot PAC-3
anti-missile batteries, eight diesel-fueled submarines and a squadron
of 12 anti-submarine aircraft, to maintain stability and peace in the
Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, asked whether he will run for Taichung mayor, Tsai
said that he is not very keen on the post, although he understands
the high expectations of Taichung voters.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Lin Chia-lung, director-general of the
Government Information Office, announced that he was resigning his
post to focus on his campaign for Taichung mayor in the year-end
election.

ONE OF THREE LOBBYING GROUPS TO EUROPE CANCELS TRIP
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of three delegations scheduled to visit
Europe to lobby on Taiwan's behalf has canceled the trip, the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Huang Wei-feng, who
is the co-leader of the delegation that was slated to visit the
Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia and Italy, said through his staff
Tuesday that he has decided to cancel the trip.
</P>
<P>
Huang said that the MAC has a heavy workload and that Beijing's
National People's Congress, the rubber-stamp parliament, is about to
meet to review the "anti-secession law" and is expected to approve
it; therefore, the MAC will have to make preparations for any
contingency, and he has no time for the trip.
</P>
<P>
However, MOFA officials said privately that the trip was probably
aborted because it was announced too early and some countries have
been under pressure by mainland China. Reports have said that Poland
and Italy were considering denying visas to members of the
delegation.
</P>
<P>
Despite the pressure from Beijing, the other delegations to
Scandinavian and Baltic countries will be able to go as scheduled in
early March, the officials added.
</P>
<P>
Yang Maysing, chairwoman of the foreign ministry's Research and
Planning Committee, said last month that in view of mainland China's
proposed "anti-secession law" against Taiwan and the European Union
leaning toward lifting an arms embargo against China, the delegations
hope to help the international community learn more about the threat
faced by Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that the delegations will try to impress upon the
international community the threat faced by Taiwan, prevent Beijing
from enacting its proposed law and oppose the lifting an arms
embargo against Beijing, imposed in the wake of the 1989 Tiananmen
Square massacre.

ECONOMIC GROWTH RATE TO HIT 4.5 PERCENT THIS YEAR: PREMIER HSIEH
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  1 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan is expected to post an economic
growth rate of more than 4.5 percent this year while keeping
unemployment below 4 percent, despite the slowdown of the global
economic expansion, Premier Frank Hsieh said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Fielding questions from lawmakers at the Legislative Yuan, the
premier said the economy has been improving continuously over the
last five years since the Democratic Progressive Party was voted into
power, with the growth rate rising from a minus 2.2 percent in 2000
to a positive 5.71 percent last year, while unemployment figures have
continued to fall.
</P>
<P>
The projected growth rate of 4.5 percent seems small compared to
the 5.71 percent of the previous year but is still remarkable
compared with other countries, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
As for the government's debt, standing at 30 percent of the gross
domestic production (GDP), it is lower than Japan's, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said he favors a balanced government budget and an increase
in government spending that stimulates economic growth.

TOURISM BUREAU WANTS DIRECT CROSS-STRAIT CRUISES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 1 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the successful end of direct charter
flights between Taiwan and mainland China for the lunar new year
holiday, cruise organizers and tourist agencies are optimistic that
direct cross-Taiwan Strait voyages can begin in line with existing
guidelines for offshore transshipments.
</P>
<P>
Star Cruises Group -- the world's third-largest cruise operator
-- is keenly interested in opening such a link, which would be
modeled after the offshore transshipment center at Kaohsiung Harbor
in southern Taiwan, which only handles transshipped products between
Taiwan and mainland China or those destined for a third country or
area.
</P>
<P>
K. C. Lu, Star Cruises general manager in Taiwan, expects direct
cruises between Taiwan and mainland China to attract a large number
of tourists from around the world.
</P>
<P>
Should direct cruises be permitted across the strait, foreign
tourists would be very willing to visit Taiwan, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time that Star Cruises has attempted to
open the door between the two sides of the Taiwan strait. Its
vessels, although registered in Hong Kong and flying the Panamanian
flag, have been forced to detour across the strait due to government
policy restrictions.
</P>
<P>
More then two years ago, the group envisaged a voyage for
enthusiastic local worshipers of the goddess Matsu to her native land
-- Meizhou in Fujian province in southern mainland China -- departing
from southern Taiwan and detouring via a third place. But the plan
was aborted due to the ensuing breakout of severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS).
</P>
<P>
Last year, Star Cruises embarked on an eight-day
Keelung-Okinawa-Shanghai cruise, but customer response was lackluster
as a result of lengthy time spent at sea.
</P>
<P>
Echoing calls from other cruise operators, the Tourism Bureau
under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications is also keen
on promoting the business. But rather than direct cross-strait
routes, the bureau is more interested in wooing visitors traveling
from a third country or area who will head for mainland China via
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Tourism Bureau Director General C. T. Su said that such services
will not violate the government ban on direct shipping with the
mainland, as only foreign passengers would be allowed to enter Taiwan
for sightseeing.
</P>
<P>
Su expressed his belief that such a service will help bring in
foreign tourists to Taiwan, as long as the Mainland Affairs Council
does not insist on cruises detouring via a third place.
</P>
<P>
Although the government has since 2000 been hoping to double
tourist arrivals by 2008 to five million a year, the number has
failed to break three million until now because of the SARS outbreaks
and the heated presidential election last year.
</P>
<P>
There were about 2.62 million foreign arrivals to Taiwan in 2000.
The figure once rose to around 2.97 million in 2004.

FUJIAN OFFICIALS VISIT MATSU TO INSPECT TOURIST ENVIRONMENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 1 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A mainland Chinese delegation, headed by
Fujian Provincial Tourism Bureau Director Huang Xiaoyen, is visiting
Matsu to examine tourist spots on the Taiwan-held frontline island.
</P>
<P>
After touring local attractions including Tienhou Temple, Tunnel
88 --where "kaoliang" rice liquor is made -- and Chinpi village,
Huang said Tuesday that the island is more interesting than he
thought.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, organized by the Kinmen, Matsu and Penghu branch
of the Fujian Provincial Association of travel agencies, arrived in
Matsu Monday via the direct "mini three links" route. Members of the
group included a provincial official in charge of Taiwan affairs, Dai
Xiaofeng.
</P>
<P>
This was the branch's first inspection-oriented visit to Matsu
since its inauguration over a year ago. The delegation will also
travel to Matsu's islets of Nankan, Peikan and Tungyin.
</P>
<P>
The tour is aimed at assessing Matsu's tourist value, a member of
the delegation said.
</P>
<P>
Up until last September the Fujian Province Government did not
allow its residents to make sightseeing trips to the two Taiwanese
territories of Kinmen and Matsu. However, despite the opening, Matsu
people still haven't seen any mainland Chinese tour groups so far,
only several inspection delegations.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan opened direct postal, trade and shipping links between its
two outlying islands and the Fujian cities of Xiamen and Mawei in
January 2002 on an experimental basis, better known as the "mini
three links."

FATE OF CROSS-STRAIT TIES TO BE DECIDED BY THE PEOPLE: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 1 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Tuesday that the
government will keep its mind open to any possibilities on the
eventual development of relations between Taiwan and mainland China
and will respect the decision of the 23 million people on the island.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the remarks during an interpellation session in the
Legislative Yuan in response to a proposal by opposition Kuomintang
Legislator Ting Shou-chung that Taiwan and the mainland form a
confederation similar to the European Union to normalize cross-Taiwan
Strait relations.
</P>
<P>
Ting also suggested that a referendum be held to let the people
vote on this proposed model.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said the government is open to any possibilities under a
framework of cross-strait peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh agreed that Ting's proposal could be a creative resolution
to the cross-strait sovereignty dispute, but he also said that the
choice of the people must be respected.
</P>
<P>
On issues concerning cross-strait agricultural exchanges, Hsieh
said they should be carried out step by step because they cover a
wide range of issues including products, technology, information,
anti-smuggling raids and division of fishery labor.
</P>
<P>
According to Council of Agriculture Chairman Lee Chin-lung,
Taiwan exported agricultural products worth US$290 million to the
mainland in 2004, up 66.1 percent compared with the 2003 figure.
</P>
<P>
Lee noted that the country insists on the principles of "Taiwan
first," reciprocity and risk management while conducting agricultural
exchanges with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The island must also protect itself against the invasion of farm
diseases and pests from the mainland, which would cause great losses
to Taiwan's agricultural sector, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
He said Taiwan is promoting its agricultural products for the
mainland and is targeting markets in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
An official at the mainland's Taiwan Affairs Office said last
week that Beijing welcomes Taiwan's agricultural sector to make
investments on the mainland and will help Taiwanese farmers establish
operations there.

PFP CHIEF DOES NOT RULE OUT VISIT TO MAINLAND CHINA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  1  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong said Tuesday he would not rule out the
possibility of visiting mainland China as a representative of the
government to promote reconciliation and peace across the Taiwan
Strait.
</P>
<P>
"But as mainland China remains suspicious about the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) administration's promise not to declare
Taiwan independence, I don't think I will be able to visit the
mainland, even if the DPP administration authorizes me to talk with
the Beijing authorities," Soong said.
</P>
<P>
Under the present circumstances, Soong said, it is more practical
that the ruling and opposition camps work together to complete the
enactment of a PFP-initiated cross-strait peace promotion bill to
create an institutionalized mechanism to boost cross-strait
reconciliation and peace.
</P>
<P>
Soong made the remarks while attending a changeover ceremony for
senior executives of the PFP legislative caucus.
</P>
<P>
He also took advantage of the occasion to defend his Feb.
24 meeting with President Chen Shui-bian, in which they
reached a 10-point agreement on Taiwan's status, cross-strait
relations, ethnic harmony and constitutional re-engineering. The
agreement has drawn a backlash from pro-independence activists who
criticized Chen for compromising on his promises to write a new
constitution for Taiwan and change the nation's name from the
Republic of China to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"Neither of us has compromised on our basic stances. Given
Taiwan's ever-closer economic interdependence with mainland China, a
majority of Taiwan people hope to see cross-strait reconciliation, "
Soong said.
</P>
<P>
He further claimed that both he and the PFP learned true
democratic principles through his meeting with Chen.
</P>
<P>
"We have learned the gist of democracy. The ruling and opposition
parties should consult to sort out a consensus as well as mutually
acceptable public policy initiatives and common goals," Soong said.
</P>
<P>
In his view, Soong said, the most critical consensus reached in
his meeting with Chen lies in their common recognition that both the
ruling and opposition parties should be loyal to the Republic of
China. "Opposition and ruling parties should communicate sincerely
and pragmatically. Pragmatism is the best way. Taiwan must reconcile
with mainland China, but it cannot waver on its fundamental stance as
well as its liberal, democratic system," Soong said.
</P>
<P>
He further said the PFP legislative caucus is willing to
rationally discuss with its DPP and Kuomintang (KMT) counterparts
crucial bills such as draft amendments to the Executive Yuan
organizational law, the National Assembly operational law, the
cross-strait peace promotion bill, the ethnic equality bill and major
bills regarding people's livelihoods.
</P>
<P>
"The PFP will not hesitate to support reasonably crafted bills
or amendments and will refrain from irrational boycotts implemented
for partisan interests," Soong said.
</P>
<P>
As an opposition party, Soong added, the PFP will continue to
play a strict supervisory role in monitoring the government to
prevent corruption and irregularities.
</P>
<P>
Soong, who served as KMT Chairman Lien Chan's running mate in the
2004 presidential election, said the PFP still insists on the pursuit
of the truth of the election-eve shooting of Chen.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, the case is now a judicial one and should be
resolved by judicial means, not anything else," Soong said.
</P>
<P>
The Lien-Soong ticket narrowly lost to the DPP ticket of Chen and
Vice President Annette Lu in the election last March. Lien and Soong
have filed two lawsuits to have the Chen-Lu ticket's re-election and
even the entire election invalidated. The Taiwan High Court rejected
both suits and Lien has appealed the case to the Supreme Court, which
has yet to rule on the lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
Core supporters of the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the PFP
were unhappy with Soong's meeting with Chen, as they regarded the
meeting as a move by Soong to recognize Chen's presidency.

TSU URGES LEGISLATIVE RESOLUTION TO OPPOSE TO 'ANTI-SECESSION LAW'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  1 (CNA)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU) on Tuesday urged the caucuses of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and the opposition parties in the Legislative
Yuan to work out a resolution to express the will of the people of
Taiwan to oppose the legislation of a proposed 'anti-secession law"
in mainland China.
</P>
<P>
The "anti-secession law" will soon be reviewed by the National
People's Congress, Beijing's rubber-stamp parliament, and is expected
to be approved when it meets in early March.
</P>
<P>
The TSU, in its version of a counter-resolution, noted that
Taiwan is an independent, sovereign state, and that Taiwan people
have the right to decide their own future and fate. China should not
enact any laws that cover the territory and people of Taiwan. The
encroachment on Taiwan's sovereignty is bound to trigger resistance
from Taiwan people.
</P>
<P>
According to the resolution, Beijing's willful promotion of the
"anti-secession law" will undermine cross-strait peaceful development
and trigger tensions in the Asia and Pacific region. As a member of
the international community, Beijing should respect the aspirations
of the region and suspend the promotion of the "anti-secession law."
</P>
<P>
The legislation will not help advance cross-trait peace or
contribute to cross-strait exchanges, but will hurt the feelings of
tens of thousands of mainland-based Taiwan businessmen and 23 million
people on Taiwan and put a damper on Taiwan businessmen's willingness
to invest in the mainland, the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
Lo Chih-ming, TSU party whip, said that Speaker Wang Jin-pyng
had promised to coordinate with other party caucuses Thursday to
produce a resolution that is agreed upon by all parties to convey the
sense of strong protest against Beijing's "anti-secession law."
</P>
<P>
Lo also said that the TSU will go to the Taipei Office of
the Interchange Association of Japan, Japan's de facto embassy in
Taiwan in the absence of diplomatic ties, to impress upon them that
Taiwan people hope China will forego the enactment of the law.
</P>
<P>
The TSU will also call on the Taipei office of the American
Institute in Taiwan, hoping that the U.S. will convey the feelings of
Taiwan people toward the law, he said.
</P>
<P>
On March 6, the TSU will sponsor a large demonstration in
Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan, to protest the proposed law, Lo
added.

The Times: The shoe bomber from a

For two years Saajid Badat hid the evidence of his secret life as
an al-Qaeda suicide bomber in a green case under his bed in his
parents' terraced house in Gloucester. In that bag was the detonator
for the high-explosive device with which he had been ordered to blow
up a transatlantic airliner, killing himself and the hundreds of
passengers on board. Badat, 25, a grammar school boy with four A
levels, was part of the same terrorist until as Richard Reid -- the
British shoe bomber now in prison in the United States. In a plot
hatched by Osama bin Laden and his associates in their Afghan
hideaway, the two britons were to begin the second wave of
spectacular terrorist attacks after those in New York and Washington
on September 11, 2001.

Shui-bian said in a recent interview with Newsweek magazine that his
administration is willing to discuss any kind of peace treaty with
mainland China in an effort to secure peace across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to discuss and talk about any sort of peace
agreement -- short-term, long-term, mid-term, " Chen told staff
reporters at the Presidential Office in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks when asked to express his viewpoints on a
proposal by Kenneth Lieberthal, an advisor to former U.S. President
Bill Clinton on East Asia, that Taiwan and the mainland delay a final
resolution of the island's status for a generation to avoid war,
during which Taipei would agree not to declare independence and
Beijing would agree not to use force against the island.
</P>
<P>
As for another Lieberthal proposal -- that sensitive cross-strait
issues be set aside for 30 years -- Chen said that 30 years is just a
proposed time frame, adding that "if by then China has not achieved a
mature democracy, we could delay it to 50 or 100 years."
</P>
<P>
Asked to envision a future in which Taiwan and the mainland
unify, Chen noted that if the people of Taiwan choose to unify with
the mainland one day, it must be done after their political
situations have achieved complete synergy in which both sides enjoy
democratic elections, multiparty politics, a truly neutral military
and freedom of speech.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Chen added, by then the average income on the mainland
should be about equal to that of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In reply to the question of whether Beijing's plan to enact a new
"anti-secession law" targeting Taiwan will impact the island, Chen
expressed deep concern over the issue, pointing out that Taiwan might
not be able to change Beijing's decision.
</P>
<P>
"This year we successfully arranged charter flights from the
mainland to Taiwan for the Lunar New Year holiday, signifying that
cross-strait relations are making advancements, like flowers
blossoming in the spring. But if they insist on passing the
"anti-secession law, " it would be like casting a shadow and causing
torrential rain, " Chen said, adding that groups in Taiwan have
started talking about enacting counterlegislation such as an
anti-annexation law. "Is this the result the Beijing authorities want
to achieve?" the president asked.
</P>
<P>
Touching on several critics' statement that he has contributed to
cross-strait tension by being needlessly provocative, Chen said
Beijing should understand that the referendum and protests last year
only reflected the people's love for their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
"Some want to misrepresent such events as provocative gestures.
But they have overlooked the aspirations of Taiwan's 23 million
people to be the masters of their own land, and the fact that China
has deployed 706 ballistic missiles targeting us. Should Taiwan just
raise a white flag and surrender?"
</P>
<P>
As for whether any configuration of the Beijing-proposed "one
country, two systems" formula for unification are acceptable, Chen
said that "we hope to see only one system everywhere, and that is the
democratic system."
</P>
<P>
The president voiced the hope that Taiwan's democracy can serve
as a lighthouse for Beijing and that the mainland will become
democratic, even more so than Taiwan is today. "But China lacks
important elements like elections, multiparty politics and a neutral
military," he went on.
</P>
<P>
Asked what he achieved by meeting opposition People First Party
Chairman James Soong last week, Chen said the meeting has proved that
anything is possible, even reconciliation between the ruling party
and the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Chen further said he took the opportunity to reaffirm his
promises, including no declaration of Taiwan independence and no
change of the name of the Republic of China.

U.S. REPORT RECOGNIZES TAIWAN'S HUMAN RIGHTS CONDITIONS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Feb.  28 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. State Department gave a
positive evaluation of Taiwan's human rights conditions in its newly
released annual statement on global human rights practices.
</P>
<P>
Titled "Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for the Year
2004, " it examines the status of human rights in 197 countries. The
10,000-word section on Taiwan recognizes Taiwan's progress in
democratic development, market economy, freedom of the press, freedom
of speech, religious freedom and various human rights protection
measures.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the report also points out several flaws and
deficiencies in Taiwan's human rights practices, including a few
corrupt cases involving judicial personnel, alleged abuse of detained
suspects by police, overcrowding in some prisons and human smuggling
practices.
</P>
<P>
The report begins by defining Taiwan as a multi-party democracy
that underwent its first-ever transition of power between different
political parties in 2000.
</P>
<P>
In the 2004 presidential election, the report says, incumbent
President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu won
re-election a day after they were shot and slightly injured.
Even though the beaten opposition camp filed two unsuccessful
lawsuits to challenge the electoral result, the report says the
election is generally recognized as free and open.
</P>
<P>
The report further says the opposition "pan-blue alliance" won a
majority in last December's free and open Legislative Yuan elections.
</P>
<P>
The report says the 23 million people of Taiwan enjoy a high
standard of living and that their incomes are generally equitable.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Taiwan's government generally respects
human rights, but it points out that there is still room for
improvement, especially in areas such as official corruption, abuse
of detained suspects and human smuggling for the sex trade.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, the report says, no cases involving illegal
killing by the government or government officials were reported.
There were also no reports about the disappearance of any person for
political reasons, the report says, adding that there were no
political prisoners and no forced exiles. All Taiwan people enjoy the
freedom to travel around the country or abroad, the report adds.
</P>
<P>
The report also recognizes Taiwan's freedom of assembly, citing
as an example the large crowds of "pan-blue alliance" supporters that
staged massive protests in front of the Presidential Office after the
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report notes the steady rise of Taiwan women's
role in the political arena, saying that the nation's first-ever
female vice president, Annette Lu, was re-elected and that Yeh
Chu-lan became Taiwan's first-ever female vice premier following the
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Of the 36 Cabinet members, eight were female; of the 25 Control
Yuan members, two were female; of the 20 Examination Yuan members,
three were women; of the 34 Central Standing Committee members of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party, eight were female; and of the
225 legislators, 47 were women.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Taiwan has not imposed any restrictions
on and has cooperated closely with human rights surveys by
international human rights organizations or non-government
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The report lauds Taiwan's prisons as "meeting international
standards." It further says the Taiwan authorities allow
representatives of international human rights organizations to visit
prison inmates. But it points out that 47 Taiwan prisons are
overcrowded and require further improvements.
</P>
<P>
The report praises Taiwan's efforts to upgrade the quality of
police officers by setting up the Central Police University.
</P>
<P>
It also recognizes the DPP administration's efforts at
eliminating vote-buying and official corruption, saying that 1,276
people were indicted in 2003, with 640 cases involving corruption and
the remaining involving vote-buying. Among those indicted, 687 were
government officials and 65 were elected representatives.
</P>
<P>
Regarding press freedom, the report says Taiwan's news media are
vibrant. But it adds that Taiwan's market may be unable to support
such a large-scale media industry, leading to the phenomenon whereby
some media organizations have to rely on government advertisements
and loans from state-owned banks, which the report says could make
those media become reserved in criticizing the government.
</P>
<P>
The report also notes that the legislature passed into law a bill
in late 2003 that requires political parties, the government and the
military to relinquish their stake in the media to rid them of
political interference.

CROSS-STRAIT TRADE VOLUME TOPS US$61.63 BILLION IN 2004
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 1 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The volume of trade between Taiwan and
mainland China amounted to US$61.63 billion in 2004, up 33.1 percent
from the previous year, the Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The figure accounted for 18 percent of Taiwan's total foreign
trade volume, representing an increase of 0.9 percent from 2003,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Exports to the mainland rose 27.2 percent year-on-year to
US$44.96 billion in 2004, which corresponded to 25.8 percent of total
exports by Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Imports from the mainland also jumped 52.2 percent year-on-year
to US$16.67 billion in 2004, which accounted for 9.9 percent of total
imports by Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Trade surplus towards the mainland amounted to US$28.28 billion
in 2004, up 15.9 percent from 2003.
</P>
<P>
BOFT officials said cross-strait trade continued to expand last
year owing to rapid economic growth on the mainland, with monthly
export volume from Taiwan to the mainland registering at between
US$3.7 billion to US$4 billion, despite negative factors such as
Beijing's measures to cool its overheated economy, soaring
international oil prices and appreciation of major currencies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the robust global demand for Taiwan products also
boosted the import of raw materials, electronic parts and components
and intermediates from the mainland, they said.
</P>
<P>
Major items exported by Taiwan to the mainland in 2004 included
electrical equipment and parts, optical products and parts, machinery
and parts, plastics, steel, organic chemical products, man-made
fibers, copper and industrial textiles.
</P>
<P>
Major items imported from the mainland in 2004 were electrical
equipment and parts, machinery and parts, steel, fossil fuel, optical
products and parts, organic chemical products, aluminum, plastics,
cement, and automobiles and parts.

TAIWAN ECONOMY RATED GREEN LIGHT FOR JANUARY: CEPD
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 1 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A green light was recorded for Taiwan's
economy in January for the fourth consecutive month, meaning that the
domestic economy has been growing steadily, according to a government
report released Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report, compiled by the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) under the Executive Yuan, shows that the composite
index, which combines both leading and current indicators, fell to 24
points for January from December's 26 points.
</P>
<P>
Hu Chung-ying, director of the CEPD's Economic Research
Department, attributed the decrease in the composite index mainly to
poor performance of the domestic financial and stock markets during
that period.
</P>
<P>
He added that should the score continue to drop to the 22-point
level, a "yellow-blue light" will be signalled to reflect a
lackluster economy.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the index of leading indicators for
January stood at 102. points, down 2.1 percent from the previous
month's 104. 3 points, the largest decrease since October 2000, while
the index of current indicators moved up by 0.8 percent to 109.0
points.
</P>
<P>
In the CEPD-devised five-color rating system, a red light
signifies an overheated economy, yellow-red indicates a heating-up
economy, green reflects steady growth, yellow-blue stands for
sluggishness and blue represents recession.

LOTTERY TO BE USED TO BOOST ELECTION TURNOUT: CEC HEAD
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 1 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A section titled "Questions with Prizes"
will be tacked on to the election notice for the election of National
Assembly members in May to boost voter turnout, an election official
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chang Cheng-hsiung, chairman of the Central Election Commission
(CEC) , said that voters who answer "Yes" or "No" to the two
questions, which are in fact not questions at all but rather
statements, will be eligible for a lottery with a first prize of NT$1
million by simply handing the section to election officials at
polling stations.
</P>
<P>
They may opt to not hand back the section, the CEC chief said.
</P>
<P>
According to Chang, the first "question" will be: "If the
National Assembly produced through this election approves amendments
to the Constitution, the electoral system of the legislators will be
switched from the current multiple lawmakers per constituency to a
single lawmaker per constituency."
</P>
<P>
The second "question" will be: "In line with the switch of the
electoral system, voters will get two ballots in legislative
elections -- one ballot for their favored party, one for their
favored candidate."
</P>
<P>
Both statements are correct.
</P>
<P>
Chang said the winners of the lottery will be chosen through a
two-phase drawing, with the first phase choosing a county or city
from which the winners will be chosen in the second phase.
</P>
<P>
The game, designed to encourage voters to go to the polls, will
be unprecedented, said Chang.
</P>
<P>
Also, the ballots for the election will be printed in horizontal
type, in line with the change in all official documents, rather than
the traditional vertical type, Chang said.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly members elected will be charged with the
task of amending the Constitution by simply approving or denying the
proposals already tabled and agreed upon by the various political
parties in the legislature.

NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM MARKS 10TH ANNIVERSARY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bureau of National Health Insurance
(BNHI) under the Department of Health (DOH) invited six people
Tuesday who have not seen a doctor over the past five years to
explain their methods of staying healthy as part of the celebration of
the bureau's 10th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
Three of them -- Kung Li-chu, Shih Ming-shang and Chang
chao-hsiung -- are in their late 60s. None of them have ever used
their national health insurance cards to seek medical treatment over
the past five years. They attributed their health to regular
exercise, an optimistic and open-minded attitude toward life and
leading a simple, regulated way of life.
</P>
<P>
According to BNHI tallies, 56,979 people have never seen a doctor
under the national health insurance (NHI) program over the past 10
years and 128,975 people have never used their NHI cards in the past
five years.
</P>
<P>
The BNHI offered special gifts to more than 2,000 of them through
a lottery draw to express its appreciation for their contributions to
the financially troubled insurance program.
</P>
<P>
BNHI tallies show that the health insurance program has offered
medical services to an average of 920,000 insured people every day
for the past decade, with its daily medical spending reaching an
average of NT$1.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
The statistics also show that NT$24 out of every NT$100 spent
under the NHI program was used to care for patients with serious
diseases or injuries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there are 16 doctors to serve every 10,000 people.
</P>
<P>
According to BNHI estimates, people from low-income families can
receive NT$5-worth of medical services for every NT$1 they actually
pay.
</P>
<P>
An official said the BNHI is now working on a second-generation
health insurance program under which the insurance premium will be
calculated in terms of household income instead of personal salaries,
as is the case under the current system.
</P>
<P>
The BNHI has offered interest-free loans to more than 60,000
low-income families annually to pay their insurance premiums, the
official said, adding that the national health insurance program has
had an approval rating of over 70 percent over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the DOH said it plans to raise the ceiling on the
index insurance premiums from the current NT$87,600 to NT$131,700
from April to help keep the shaky insurance program afloat. About
167,000 people will have to pay an average additional NT$145 in
monthly premiums.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the insured amount of the 600,000 government employees,
teachers and military personnel will be raised from the current 82.42
percent of their monthly salary to 87.04 percent.
</P>
<P>
After these two measures are implemented, the BNHI will have an
additional income of NT$3.4 billion annually to support the health
insurance program.

 Taipei, Jan. 1 (CAN) Nearly 60 percent of Taiwan manufacturers
are neutral about their economic prospects for the next three months,
according to the results of a government survey released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted by the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development Council (CEPD) in January, shows that 23
percent of those polled expected the domestic economy to take a turn
for the better, in comparison with December's 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
The ratio for those who expect the economic outlook to take a
turn for the worse during the coming three months remained unchanged
at 17 percent, the survey indicates.
</P>
<P>
In January, sales in Taiwan's manufacturing sector increased by
28.2 percent in value year-to-year, while new orders received by
manufacturers grew by 19.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the utilization rate of installed facilities
averaged 80.3 percent, up 3.2 percent from the same period of last

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian called on the
European Union Tuesday to support Taiwan and not to lift its arms
embargo on mainland China.
</P>
<P>
In a teleconference with several European parliamentarians and
journalists in Brussels, Chen said the E.U.'s possible lifting of the
embargo is a cause of serious concern to the United States and Japan
because both countries understand it would tip the military balance
between Taiwan and the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Citing the repeated resolution of the European Parliament
demanding that Beijing withdraw its missiles targeting Taiwan, the
president said that the number of Beijing's missiles has increased
from 496 in 2003 to 706 this year.
</P>
<P>
The lifting of the arms embargo would also send the wrong message
to the mainland authorities that the communist regime need neither
improve its human rights record nor move toward democracy.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the European states to realize the mainland's
attempts to unilaterally change the status quo across the Taiwan
Strait by enacting an anti-secession law designed to prevent Taiwan
from pursuing its own political identity.
</P>
<P>
The law would give the mainland the legal basis to dictate the
status of Taiwan, which would disrupt the stability across the strait
and pose a serious risk to peace in the Asian Pacific region, Chen
claimed. 
</P>
<P>
He rebutted the criticism from "leaders of certain countries"
of his decision to hold a national referendum along with the 2004
presidential election, saying that referendum is an inherent part of
democracy, and questioned "Why can France hold a referendum but
Taiwan cannot?"

PREMIER DENIES ANY CROSS-STRAIT CONSENSUS ON `ONE CHINA'
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 1 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)

<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh denied Tuesday that
Taiwan and mainland China ever reached consensus on the definition of
"one China" in their landmark 1992 negotiations in Hong Kong -- the
so-called "'92 Consensus."
</P>
<P>
During an interpellation in the Legislative Yuan, the premier
turned down a request from a lawmaker of the opposition Kuomintang to
acknowledge the existence of the "'92 Consensus, " saying that at
best, the two sides merely "agreed to disagree" on the issue.
</P>
<P>
"'Agree to disagree' means 'no coalescence of opinion' at all, "
the premier pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The consensus, purporting to be agreed upon by Taiwan and China
during the 1992 negotiations, has been considered by Beijing as the
basis for its engagement with Taiwan. Beijing insisted on Taiwan's
acknowledgement of the consensus as a condition for the resumption of
bilateral dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh's denial means the political impasse will continue.

<P>
The consensus of a Taiwan-centric identity
would be better built through reconciliation among the political
groups than through fierce partisan bickering, Premier Frank Hsieh
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a defense of his "charm offensive" on the opposition parties,
Hsieh told a lawmaker from his Democratic Progressive Party at the
Legislative Yuan that splitting Taiwan would only weaken the
country's international position and give an "alien regime" an
opportunity to manipulate the country.

E.U. LAWMAKER TO TABLE MOTION AGAINST CHINA'S ANTI-SECESSION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Brussels, March 1 (CNA)
(By Y. S. Lo and Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A German member of the European
Parliament expressed explicit opposition Tuesday to Beijing's plans
to enact an anti-secession law targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
E.U. Parliamentarian Georg Jazembowski said he will initiate a
resolution at the Parliament soon to give the E.U. lawmakers an
opportunity to try to prevent enactment of the proposed law.
</P>
<P>
Jazembowski said the European Parliament should, via a
resolution, tell the Chinese categorically that what the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait need is politicial dialogue, instead of weapons
aimed at each other.
</P>
<P>
Jazembowski made the remarks during a teleconference held
Tuesday, during which Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
exchanged views with a number of E.U. lawmakers as well as
journalists stationed in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
During the video-conference, President Chen called on the
European Union not to lift its ban on arms sales to mainland China,
saying that the possible lifting of the embargo has been a cause of
serious concern to the United States and Japan because both countries
understand it would tilt the military balance across the Taiwan
Strait.
</P>
<P>
Chen also urged the E.U. member states to realize the mainland's
attempts to unilaterally change the status quo across the Taiwan
Strait by enacting an anti-secession law designed to prevent Taiwan
from pursuing its own political identity.
</P>
<P>
Jazembowski, who has visited Taiwan in the past and who referred
to President Chen as "my dear friend" during the teleconference,
claimed that the proposed anti-secession law is a "political weapon"
aimed at Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Jazembowski added that he has been pushing for the European Union
to pay closer attention to the security situations in the
Asia-Pacific region, including some "sensitive" issues involving
Korea, China, Japan and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
During the video-conference, President Chen said that the number
of mainland Chinese missiles aimed at Taiwan has increased from 496
in 2003 to 706 this year despite repeated European Parliament
resolutions demanding that Beijing withdraw the missiles.
</P>
<P>
A lifting of the arms embargo would also send the wrong message
to the mainland authorities that the communist regime need neither
improve its human rights record nor move toward democracy, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the law would give the mainland the legal basis to
dictate the status of Taiwan, which would disrupt the stability
across the strait and pose a serious risk to peace in the Asian
Pacific region.

LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER MIGHT ANNOUNCE BID TO RUN FOR KMT CHAIRMAN SOON
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 2 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, who
also serves as a vice chairman of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) ,
said Wednesday he is likely to run for the party's chairmanship if
incumbent Chairman Lien Chan decides not to seek re-election.
</P>
<P>
Wang said he will see what Lien's true attitude is before making
his next move.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, although Lien has expressed a lack of interest
in continuing his chairmanship, this does not mean he definitely will
not run for re-election.
</P>
<P>
While it is widely believed that Wang will run for the next KMT
chairmanship, he has not made an official announcement.
</P>
<P>
The KMT is scheduled to promulgate on March 21 details of the
chairmanship election which is set for May.
</P>
<P>
Wang said he will make an announcement before the deadline for
registration and start campaigning for his bid if he decides to join
the election.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, another KMT vice chairman,
who announced his decision to run in the chairmanship election last
month, said he has not set up a campaign office.
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, Wang called for unity of the "pan-blue"
alliance of the KMT, People First Party and New Party while
delivering a report to the KMT's Central Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Wang pointed out that Premier Frank Hsieh's policy of
reconciliation and coexistence, which differs from the hard-line
policy adopted by his predecessor Yu Shyi-kun, seems to have won much
popular support.
</P>
<P>
However, Wang said, the adjustments of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) are only a compromise following its setback
in last year's legislative elections, and not a reflection of its
past mistakes.
</P>
<P>
Wang warned that the DPP will restore its old attitude if the
"pan-blue" alliance falls apart.

GIO CHIEF MEETS TOP TAIWAN ENVOY IN JAPAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Tokyo,   March  2  (CNA)
(By Amy Huang and Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Government Information Office (GIO)
Director-General Lin Chia-lung met with Taiwan's top representative
to Japan, Koh Se-kai, Wednesday to exchange views mainly on Beijing's
plans to enact an anti-secession law and its possible impact on
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lin called for consolidation among the political parties in
Taiwan to jointly deal with the challenges that Taiwan now faces,
including Beijing's move to enact an anti-secession law.
</P>
<P>
Lin, who arrived in Tokyo Tuesday for a five-day visit, also
called for the Beijing leadership to stop enactment of the
anti-secession law before it's too late to avoid the Taiwanese people
from taking to the streets or moving to enact an anti-annexation law
in response.
</P>
<P>
The GIO chief is one of the Taiwan officials, including Mainland
Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu, who have been traveling abroad
recently to amplify Taiwan's opposition to and concerns about China's
proposed anti-secession law.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting with Lin, Koh was asked by reporters about
Japanese news reports that President Chen Shui-bian's wife, Wu
Shu-jen, is planning to visit Japan in the near future. Koh said that
his office has yet received any information on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on President Chen's remarks a day earlier that he is
unable to change the nation's official designation of "the Republic
of China" to "the Republic of Taiwan" during his term, Koh said that
changing the national designation and changing the names of Taiwan
offices overseas are two different matters.
</P>
<P>
Noting that changing the names of Taiwan's overseas offices or
missions to include the word "Taiwan" would help Taiwan to be more
clearly identified in the international community, Koh said the
name-change drive should be forged ahead with.
</P>
<P>
Lin, who announced his decision Tuesday to resign from his
Cabinet post to seek the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's
nomination to run for the mayorship of the central Taiwan city of
Taichung, is expected to meet with Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara
as well as Mayor Hiroshi Nakada of the Japanese port city of
Yokohama, during his stay in Japan.
</P>
<P>
He will also tour Yokohama's newly developed commercial zone and
the exhibition site of the 2005 World Expo scheduled to open in the
central Japanese prefecture of Aichi later this month.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Lin will attend a seminar on East Asia security and
prosperity to be held at the Japanese Press Club in Tokyo. The
seminar will bring together scholars, experts and lawmakers from
Japan, the United States and Taiwan to discuss the contents of the
new U.S.-Japanese security treaty as well as the possible impact of
Beijing's anti-secession law and Taiwan's future.

EX-INDEPENDENT LAWMAKER NAMES ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS COUNCIL CHIEF
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 2 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh announced Wednesday the
appointment of former independent aboriginal Legislator Walis Pelin
as chairman of the Council of Aboriginal Affairs, scheduled to take
effect March 10.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said that Walis Pelin has been an independent legislator
elected by aborigine voters for many terms and has constantly kept
abreast of aboriginal affairs and related developments.
</P>
<P>
Walis Pelin, himself an aborigine, has also been supportive of
President Chen Shui-bian's vow to allow Taiwan's aboriginal
population of around 450,000 to run their own autonomous communities,
Hsieh noted.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh added that he exchanged views with Walis Pelin before
making the decision on the appointment and that during the talks, he
became aware that the legislator's perspective on projects to save or
co-operate in aboriginal communities islandwide match those of his
own "islandwide community development plans."
</P>
<P>
Hsieh also made known his admiration for Chen Chien-nien, the
outgoing chairman of the Cabinet-level Council of Aboriginal Affairs,
who offered to resign recently after he was charged by Taitung
prosecutors with vote-buying.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh accepted Chen's resignation Tuesday but noted that being
prosecuted does not necessarily mean Chen is guilty.

U.S. HAS NO COMMENT ON PRESIDENT'S ASSURANCE OF NO ROC NAME-CHANGE

<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. State Department declined to
comment Tuesday on President Chen Shui-bian's latest remarks that he
will not change the official name of his country from the Republic of
China to "Republic of Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
State Department Deputy Spokesman Adam Ereli told a daily press
briefing he was unaware of Chen's comments.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that Chen has made similar assurances
before and that Washington takes them very seriously.
</P>
<P>
"He has certainly made assurances regarding unilateral steps in
the past. We have welcomed those assurances and we continue to put
great store by them," Ereli said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Washington opposes unilateral action on either
side of the Taiwan Strait and believes cross-strait tension should be
resolved through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
In a teleconference with a group of European parliamentarians on
that same day (Taipei time) , Chen said it is unnecessary for Taiwan
to declare independence because it is already a sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he said, it will be impossible during his term to
change the official name of the country as the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party controls less than 50 percent of seats in the
225-member Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Chen also reaffirmed that his planned constitutional reforms will
not involve changes to national sovereignty and territory or issues
regarding unification and independence, on which a majority consensus
is still lacking.
</P>
<P>
Any amendments to the Constitution require the approval of three
fourths of the legislature.

TAIWAN RANKS 19TH IN THE WORLD IN DEFENSE SPENDING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 2 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan spent US$7.3 billion on national
defense in 2003, ranking 19th in the world, the Directorate General
of Budget, Accounting &amp; Statistics (DGBAS) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's 2003 defense budget was far less than the US$32.8
billion spent by mainland China in the same year, DGBAS officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the latest yearbook published by the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), DGBAS officials said
that the world spent US$879 billion on arms in 2003, a record high
since 1992, when such world spending totaled around US$847 billion.
</P>
<P>
The world military spending has gradually dropped since 1992 and
the end of the Cold War, when the Soviet Union disintegrated, to the
lowest point in six years of US$693 billion in 1998, DGBAS officials
quoted the SIPRI report as indicating.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in 1998, however, world defense expenditure has risen
yearly, to the 11-year high of US$879 billion in 2003, DGBAS
officials said.
</P>
<P>
According to the SIPRI Yearbook, the United States, Japan, the
United Kingdom, France and mainland China, in that order, were the
top five defense-spending countries in the world, accounting for a
total of more than 60 percent of the total military spending
worldwide in 2003. The United States now accounts for 43 percent of
world military expenditure.
</P>
<P>
The yearbook also notes marked regional disparities in military
expenditure, DGBAS officials said, adding that in 2003, Saudi Arabia
spent 9.8 percent of its GDP on the military, compared to the United
States' 3.4 percent, Taiwan's 2.3 percent and China's 2.5 percent.
Following Saudi Arabia, the four other top countries in terms of
disparity were Israel, with 9.2 percent, Turkey, with 4.9 percent,
Russia, with 4.0 percent and Iran, also with 4.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan spent 2.3 percent of its GDP on defense in 2003, a decline
of 2.3 percentage points from the 1994 level, DGBAS officials said.

PREMIER URGES BEIJING TO HEED TAIWAN PUBIC OPINION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 2 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh urged mainland China
Wednesday to heed President Chen Shui-bian's recent comment on the
nation's sovereignty and not miscalculate Taiwan public opinion.
</P>
<P>
The premier was referring to Chen's statement Feb. 24 that the
"Republic of China is a sovereign independent country, that the ROC's
sovereignty belongs to the 23 million people of Taiwan and that only
the 23 million people of Taiwan can make a final decision on any
change of the nation's future."
</P>
<P>
The premier made the remarks as mainland China's rubber-stamp
National People's Congress is about to meet to review and approve
Beijing's proposed "anti-secession law." The law will lay the legal
basis for Beijing to use force against Taiwan should the island
declare independence.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said the proposed law has caused revulsion among a great
majority of the Taiwan people and that lawmakers across the party
spectrum are opposed to it.

</P>
<P>
He urged Beijing not to miscalculate Taiwan public opinion and to
adhere to its earlier statement that it "pins its hopes on the Taiwan
people and respects the will of the Taiwan people to be their own
masters."
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said that the recent outcry over the proposed law has shown
to the international community and Beijing the voice of the Taiwan
people, which says they love peace, want to maintain the status quo
and insist on Taiwan's own identity.
</P>
<P>
He urged the international community to pay attention to peace in
the Taiwan Strait and to work toward preventing Beijing's
anti-secession legislation.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh also said that passing the "anti-secession law" would lack
wisdom and undermine the basis for cross-strait co-existence. The
enactment will not only sabotage the positive atmosphere between the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait that developed in the wake of the
charter flights during the Chinese New Year holiday, but will also
have negative impact on cross-strait exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The premier also urged Beijing to contribute more positively to
cross-strait peace and to stop using intimidation as an approach.

The Times: Labour shrugs off risk from
pre-election rate increase.

Home owners are facing the prospect of an interest rate rise just
weeks before an expected general election, although Labour insisted
yesterday that the move would not cost it votes. A quarter-point
increase would add £15 a month to the cost of a £100,000 home loan.
Ed Balls, Gordon Brown's closest ally, said the Chancellor was fully
prepared for a pre-election rise of a quarter point and claimed that
a hike would highlight the strength of the economy rather than anger
voters facing higher mortgage payments.

Financial Times: IMF casts doubt on German economy.

Germany's economic prospects have deteriorated sharply, the
International Monetary Fund believes. Draft figures to be released

0.8 per cent in 2005 against its 1.8 per cent forecast last

TOBACCO TAX TO BE HIKED
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 2 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To reinforce efforts to counter and prevent
tobacco hazards, the Cabinet passed Wednesday draft amendments to the
Tobacco Control Act and the Tobacco and Liquor Tax Law.
</P>
<P>
Executive Yuan spokesman Chuo Jung-tai said at a news briefing
that the amendments are centered on a move to double taxes on tobacco
products, which will as a result hike the price of a pack of
cigarettes by at least NT$5 (US$0.161) if the revisions are approved
by the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Under the revised laws, cigarette taxes will be increased from
NT$5 to NT$10 per pack. It has been assessed that the hike can add
about NT$6 billion to the government's tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to support national heath insurance
operations, according to Chuo.

</P>
<P>
Referring to the world's first global public health treaty -- the
Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) -- which entered into
force Feb. 27, Chuo indicated that a tax increase on cigarettes is
regarded as the most effective and powerful measure to reduce
cigarette consumption in every class of consumers, especially
teenagers.
</P>
<P>
Even though Taiwan is a not a member of the World Health
Organization, which implemented the FCTC, the Legislative Yuan
ratified the convention Jan. 14 to demonstrate the country's
commitment to public health issues.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey conducted by the Bureau of Health Promotion
under the Cabinet-level Department of Health, the number of smokers
in Taiwan are estimated to be 4.89 million. The country spends some
NT$30 billion a year on smoking-related illnesses that take the lives
of an estimated 18,000 people on the island every year, the survey
shows.

FORMER SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT VOICES CONCERN OVER TAIWAN SECURITY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Seoul,  March 2 (CNA)
(By  Y.C. Jiang and Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former South Korean President Kim Young Sam
voiced concern Wednesday over Taiwan's security and claimed that the
international community will not allow Beijing to use its proposed
anti-secession law to invade Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Kim made the remarks during a meeting with a group of lawmakers
from Taiwan led by opposition People First Party (PFP) Legislator
Shen Chih-hwei and composed of Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Yang
Li-huan, ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Chang
Hua-kuan and Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) Legislator Liu Kuan-ping,
among others.
</P>
<P>
Kim pointed out that the international community is gravely
concerned about Beijing's planned legislation of an anti-secession
law aimed at Taiwan and said that the United States and Japan have
made their stance clear by calling Taiwan a common strategic
objective.
</P>
<P>
Shen urged Kim to help transmit Taiwan's opposition to the law to
Beijing and claimed that its enactment will engulf the whole Asia in
the danger of war should Beijing launch an attack of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"The legislation will provide Beijing with the legal basis to
wage a preemptive war against Taiwan, " Shen said.
</P>
<P>
She also criticized Beijing's insistence on enacting the law
despite Taiwan's show of goodwill, referring to the 10-point joint
statement made public late last month by President Chen Shui-bian and
PFP Chairman James Soong.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's National People's Congress is expected to pass the
anti-secession bill into law in the middle of this month.
</P>
<P>
For her part, Chang extended an invitation on behalf of President
Chen inviting Kim to visit Taiwan again in the near future, and
relayed the president's aspiration for peace in the Taiwan Strait and
his pledge not to change the Republic of China's moniker during his
term. Kim visited Taiwan in late October last year.
</P>
<P>
Chang also called for enhanced and closer exchanges between
Taiwan and South Korea, given that the two countries share much
common ground in their political developments.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that the imposition of Beijing's anti-secession law
will undoubtedly stir up strong opposition among the people of Taiwan
and she asked Kim to play the role of a bridge to help ease tension
between Taiwan and the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Although the KMT is an opposition party, she said that it shares
a common view with the government on protecting Taiwan's security and
interests.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Yang's remarks, Liu said that the TSU stands firm with
the Taiwan people against Beijing's scheme to swallow up Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The legislative delegation will take part in a breakfast prayer
meeting Thursday organized by the South Korean government on behalf
of the Republic of China's Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
While here, the Taiwan lawmakers will also visit the South Korean
parliament and meet with their South Korean counterparts before
flying back to Taiwan Friday.

PRO-INDEPENDENCE CAMP ANGERED BY PRESIDENT'S 'NO NAME-CHANGE' WORDS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  2 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The pro-independence opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) accused President Chen Shui-bian Wednesday of
evading his responsibility after he claimed it will be impossible
during his term to change the official name of the country.
</P>
<P>
Chen told a group of European parliamentarians through a
teleconference a day earlier that the bid to change the name of the
country from the Republic of China to "Republic of Taiwan" will not
be achieved during his term in light of the fact that the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) controls less than 50 percent of
the seats in the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Also, Chen noted that his predecessor, Lee Teng-hui, failed to
change the name during his 12-year term and that he believes Lee
would not be able to attain this goal, either, if he were still
president today.
</P>
<P>
Lee is now the so-called "spiritual leader" of the TSU and is
promoting a campaign to officially call the country "Taiwan" and to
draft a new constitution.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the president's comments, TSU Secretary-General
Chen Chien-ming claimed that Lee never put forth any ideas to change
the name of the country during his terms as president.
</P>
<P>
However, he continued, President Chen has expressed on many
occasions his support for efforts by pro-independence groups to
change the name and to introduce a new constitution, but has done
very little to honor his promises.
</P>
<P>
Lo Chih-ming, convener of the TSU legislative caucus, urged
President Chen to stop using Lee as an excuse for evading his own
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Lo agreed that the goal to make Taiwan a truly independent,
sovereign state is not attainable by the president alone because it
requires the collective willpower of all Taiwanese people.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, Chen can call the tune for the 23 million
people on the island and encourage them to work toward the goal,
instead of dampening their spirits.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, independence supporters Koo Kuan-min and Ng Chiau-tong
accused Chen of being capricious for backing away from his own
promise to implement a new constitution for Taiwan in 2008.
</P>
<P>
Koo and Ng resigned in protest Tuesday as senior presidential
adviser and national policy adviser, respectively, after Chen
reaffirmed his "five noes" commitment, including no independence for
Taiwan and no name-change for the country, during a meeting with
opposition People First Party Chairman James Soong last week.
</P>
<P>
In the face of the widespread displeasure within the
pro-independence camp at Chen's recent statements, DPP legislative
caucus leader Lai Ching-teh proposed that senior party members visit
pro-independence groups to seek their support.
</P>
<P>
Lai said the DPP has no intention of alienating the TSU or the
pro-independence camp and he urged the TSU to work together with the
DPP for the unity of Taiwan in order to counter the military threat
from mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Lai pointed out that Lee's efforts to promote democratic reforms
during his 12-year term encountered much obstruction even with the
majority backing of the Kuomintang in the past, and said the
situation faced by Chen now is even more difficult, given that the
DPP and the TSU together enjoy only 101 seats in the 225-member
legislature.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. House Representative Steve Chabot
(R-Ohio) urged the European Union Tuesday not to let the vested
interests of a few arms dealers dictate E.U. policy and not to lift
its arms embargo on mainland China imposed in the wake of the 1989
Tiananmen Square massacre.
</P>
<P>
Chabot, co-leader of the Congressional Taiwan Caucus, a group
friendly toward Taiwan in the U.S. Congress, made the remarks during 
a press conference for the Taiwan media at his office.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, it would be a mistake for the Europeans to lift the
arms embargo," Chabot said, adding that it is "against the interests
of Taiwan, the interests to the United States and ultimately against
the interest of Europeans."
</P>
<P>
He said the House has overwhelmingly passed the resolution
opposing an E.U. lifting of the embargo and expressed the hope that
the E.U. will take that into consideration.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the U.S. Congress will introduce a bill to sanction the
E.U. if it lifts the embargo, Chabot said it is premature
to talk about what the U.S. might or might not do.
</P>
<P>
But he expressed hope that the Europeans will act in their own 
interest, as the lifting will not be in anybody's best interests,
particularly in light of what happened in Tiananmen Square and with
mainland China's human rights record.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that although the United States is trying to
work with the E.U. as closely as possible on a whole range of issues,
he has not seen any weakening of the U.S. opposition to a lifting of
the embargo.

TAIWAN PEOPLE FAVOR LIMITS ON HI-TECH OUTFLOWS: POLL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 2 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most of the people in Taiwan are in favor
of imposing restrictions on the outflow of the country's high
technologies, especially when the issue comes to national security in
terms of mainland China, according to the results of a survey
made public Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The public opinion poll carried out by Taiwan Advocates, a
private think tank promoting Taiwan independence, showed that nearly
70 percent of the people agreed with the government's control of
outflows of Taiwan's hi-tech know-how amid aggressive foreign
competition.
</P>
<P>
The ratio further went up to 72.6 percent when national security
was taken into account, with 65 percent of the respondents favoring
implementing such measures when it comes to the mainland, the poll
discovered. Only 22 percent were in favor of a policy opening.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted Feb. 26-27, with 1,103 valid
questionnaires recovered. It had a margin of error of 2.95 percent.
</P>
<P>
In line with the release of the survey results, Taiwan Advocates
also held a seminar the same day in which scholars and specialists
voiced their views on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Lo Cheng-fang, a professor at National Cheng Kung University,
urged Vice Premier Wu Rong-i, formerly a well-known economist, to
wholly review the government's policy on the grounds that Taiwan's
leadership role in the global semiconductor industry has been
seriously eroded by mainland China, which is posing a great threat to
Taiwan's competitive edge and economic strength.
</P>

National Chiao Tung University Professor Wu Chung-hsing said that
technology flight to mainland China will have a big impact on
Taiwan's national security, accelerating industry's relocations and
worsening unemployment at home.

Taiwan Advocates made the survey after a court case involving
United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC) provoked a heated debate in

<P>
UMC, the world's second-largest chipmaker on a contract basis,
was charged last month by prosecutors with illegal investment in a
mainland-based chip company based in Suzhou. The semiconductor
giant's headquarters and factories in Taipei and Hsinchu were stormed
by more than 80 prosecutors on tips provided by an informant.

INCREASING  ECONOMIC GROWTH A GOVERNMENT GOAL:  PREMIER HSIEH
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 2 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Striving to raise the economic growth rate
this year above the projected 4.21 percent is a government goal,
Premier Frank Hsieh said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the comment during a Cabinet meeting after listening
to a briefing from the Council for Economic Planning and Development
on the current economic situation.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the latest official report that shows the
unemployment has steadily decreased to 4.06 percent in January, Hsieh
said the figure proved the government's economic policies are
working.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan had an economic growth rate of 5.71 percent last year, the
best since 2001.
</P>
<P>
Since the global economy will be impacted by various factors,
including fluctuations in exchange rates and interest rates, as well
as changes in oil prices, the premier instructed his Cabinet to pay
close attention to possible impacts on Taiwan and at the same time to
take action to carry out major construction projects and boost
private investments in public construction plans to preserve economic
growth.

MND STARTS NEW CAMPAIGN TO DRUM UP SUPPORT FOR ARMS DEAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 2 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of National Defense (MND)
started a new campaign Wednesday to drum up support for its proposed
purchase of arms from the United States.
</P>
<P>
The campaign features eight different posters appealing to the
public's desire for peace and security, said Gen. Hu Cheng-pu, the
chief of the Political Warfare Bureau, at a news conference to unveil
the posters.
</P>
<P>
Hu said the posters were designed to bring home to the general
public the importance of pursuing peace through strength and to steer
clear of the political disputes between the ruling and opposition
parties.
</P>
<P>
With each of the eight posters targeting a different group of
people, Hu said the whole campaign will cover most demographics in
Taiwan. The purchase, carrying a price tag of NT$610.8 billion (about
US$ 18.23 billion) , has caused alarm in the opposition-controlled
Legislative Yuan because of its huge amount and because the
government put it in a special budget that is exempt from the legal
cap that exists on the government's ordinary budget.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's campaign last year focused on downplaying the cost
of the package, claiming that the price would only be the cost of a
cup of "pearl milk tea" per person per day, which only angered the
opposition, who dismissed it as misleading.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is eager to have the budget approved as soon as
possible, and Defense Minister Lee Jye has put his career at stake by
threatening to step down if the arms purchase is killed by the
Legislative Yuan.

U.S. CONGRESSMAN WANTS RESOLUTION AGAINST CHINA'S 'ANTI-SECESSION LAW'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  March 2 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U. S. Congressman Steve Chabot said
Tuesday that he is urging the Congress to pass a resolution
introduced by him on Feb. 17 to oppose China moving forward with its
"anti-secession law."
</P>
<P>
Worrying that the legislation could upset the stability and the
status quo in the region, Chabot who is the co-chairman of a
pro-Taiwan group in the Congress -- the Congressional Taiwan Caucus
-- said it would be a great mistake on the part of China to enact the
law.
</P>
<P>
Although outsiders haven't seen the text of the Chinese law at
this point, Chabot said, "We have a pretty good idea of what that
language is going to say...what we've heard is it is very damaging to
the stability of the region."
</P>
<P>
Noting that mainland China may move on the legislation next week,
Chabot said the Congress has to act quickly. "We would encourage the
State Department to join the Congress in convincing the PRC [People's
Republic of China] not to move ahead with this," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian's
statement Tuesday in Taipei that he won't change the name of the
Republic of China into the Republic of Taiwan, Chabot said Chen has
made a good effort to try to lower tensions with mainland China. "I
think he has handled this very responsibly and I commend him for his
actions thus far," Chabot said.
</P>
<P>
In light of mainland China's substantial military buildup, Chabot
urged Taiwan to move forward to modernize its military, saying that
the U.S. is working with Taiwan, but there has been some
foot-dragging in this regard for some time now.

TAIWAN PEOPLE LACK GEOGRAPHY KNOWLEDGE: MAGAZINE INVESTIGATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 2 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan people are not good geographers, as
results of a recent investigation made public Wednesday showed that
nearly 70 percent of the public do not have adequate knowledge about
their country and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
According to the results of a survey jointly carried out last
month by the National Geographic Magazine and the Geographical
Society of China based in Taiwan, 69 percent of Taiwan people failed
to pass the test. The public received an average score of 46.8 points
-- well below the passing level of 60 points based on a 100 scale.
</P>
<P>
Among the more than 1,000 people aged between 15 and 50 years
tested, only nine people received a 100, and 334 people got a passing
grade -- an average passing rate of about 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
Men outperformed women on the test, with a passing percentage of
30 percent to 24 percent, the investigation found.
</P>
<P>
In terms of age, the 31 to 35 age group was the most
knowledgeable, while people living in northern Taiwan noticeably
possess stronger geography knowledge than those residing in southern
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The question most often missed was "Which country earns the most
money from Taiwan?" The answer is Japan instead of mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Only 21 percent know the location of Afghanistan in West Asia,
and 26 percent do not have any idea about Taiwan's population.
</P>
<P>
All this is an indication that Taiwan people are indifferent to
this world and lack a basic understanding of their own country and
the international community, a National Geographic Magazine executive
said.
</P>
<P>
Shen Shu-min, a professor at National Taiwan Normal University,
pointed out that the results should signal an urgent need for greater
education reform to increase local people's knowledge about their own
land and their international prospective.

Saving energy and accelerating
globalization must be key programs for global sustainability, Lee
Yuan-tseh, winner of the 1986 Nobel Prize in chemistry, said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lee, who serves as president of Academia Sinica, Taiwan's highest
research institute, warned in a speech on "living in the rapidly
changing world" that a global crisis will erupt in 20 years if global
consumption of crude oil maintains its current pace.
</P>
<P>
If this is the case, a war among nations that vie for energy
resources may happen, he said.
</P>
<P>
The resolution to the problem would be saving on energy
consumption and accelerating the globalization, he suggested.
</P>
<P>
Globalization would blur the boundaries between nations and
countries would see problems in every corner of the world as their
own domestic affairs and would not resort to the use of force to
resolve international disputes, he explained.

OFFICIAL WORRIES ABOUT PEOPLE'S  REACTION TO 'ANTI-SECESSION LAW'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 2 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chiu Tai-san, vice chairman of the Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) , said Wednesday he is worried that the people
of Taiwan will react drastically against mainland China if it moves
forward with its "anti-secession law" in defiance of strong
disapproval by those on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Citing a survey conducted by the Institute of International
Relations (IIR) under National Chengchi University, Chiu said 82.3
percent of Taiwanese oppose the legislation which analysts say could
justify an attack by mainland China against Taiwan, and 74.1 percent
said they don't believe Beijing's claims that the law won't
compromise the rights of Taiwan people.
</P>
<P>
With this law in place, Chiu claimed that mainland China would be
capable of punishing Taiwanese considered by it as separatists, and
this is especially offensive to 80 percent of those surveyed.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the survey found that 61 percent of the people said
the law would hinder exchanges between the two sides, while 55
percent said it would cast a shadow over future dialogue between
Taiwan and the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The MAC vice chairman said the government is bracing itself for
any negative impacts because of the legislation but is worried that
some people who are not satisfied with the government's moderate
response to mainland China may resort to more violent action.
</P>
<P>
By having recourse to an "anti-secession law," Chiu said mainland
China has left Taiwanese with the impression that it is
"insensitive," "moody" and is pursuing "hegemony."
</P>
<P>
Chiu said the law will also betray mainland China's new
definition of "one China, " which will say that there is only one
China, with mainland and Taiwan being a part of it; thereby deepen
Taiwanese fear of mainland China.
</P>
<P>
The IIR's survey was based on 1,088 valid samples collected by
phone Feb. 25-27 among the island's adults. The margin of error was
not given.

: PM: Vital to balance Budget this year.

In a robust defence of his first Budget as
Prime Minister, Mr Lee Hsien Loong yesterday 
rejected a chorus of calls for a more business-
friendly spending programme.

Take a look at the big picture, he told
Parliament.

Look at what the Government has done for
businesses over the past five years: A raft of 
tax changes have saved business at least $1.8 
billion a year.

And consider the Government's fiscal
position, he said during the Budget debate.

It must balance its books in this year of
steady growth.

If it does not, it has little hope of
balancing its accounts over any business cycle.

The Lianhe Zaobao: PM: No need to hold a
referendum on the casino issue.

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who
disclosed yesterday, two days after the deadline
for submissions, said Government will not hold a
referendum for Singaporeans to vote on the
casino issue. Neither will it lift the Party
Whip for Members of Parliament (MPs) to vote
freely,he said, turning down recent suggestions
from menbers of the House.

FORMER PRESIDENT DISAPPOINTED BY PRESENT PRESIDENT'S REMARKS

<TEXT>
<P>
Former President Lee Teng-hui is
disappointed by President Chen Shui-bian's recent remarks that even
Lee himself couldn't change the name of the country if he were
president today, Lee's daughter said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lee An-ni, vice president of the Taiwan Research Institute think
tank, was referring to President Chen's remarks during a
videoconference with members of the European Parliament, as well as 
academics and journalists in Brussels Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that he couldn't change the official name of the
country from "the Republic of China" to "the Republic of Taiwan"
within the remaining three years of his term and that to say he could
would be fooling himself and others.
</P>
<P>
The daughter of the former president said that to embrace the
idea of a "Republic of China" that doesn't exist internationally and
the goal of unification with China is in itself fooling oneself and
others.
</P>
<P>
Lee defended her father's campaign of rectifying the nation's
name, saying that everything cannot be achieved in a single leap and
that one has to set the goal and work toward it courageously.
</P>
<P>
Lee, a researcher on gender equality, made the remarks on the
sidelines of a press conference sponsored by the opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) to unveil five top priority bills for women.
</P>
<P>
The five bills include an amendment to the domestic violence
prevention law, a childbirth health bill, and a gender equality basic
law bill. The remaining two bills call for the establishment of a
gender equality committee and a national pension system.
</P>
<P>
TSU Chairman Su Chin-chiang urged all legislators across the
party spectrum to lend support to the five bills to promote the
rights of women.

RESIGNED KMT VICE CHAIRMAN DENIES PLAN TO ACCEPT SEF POST
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  3 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vincent Siew, who resigned as a vice
chairman of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) a day earlier, denied
Thursday that his resignation has anything to do with a reported
offer for him to head the semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF).
</P>
<P>
A local daily reported that Siew, who is now chairman of the
government-funded Chung Hua Institution for Economic Research and
founder of an organization promoting a common market across the
Taiwan Strait, could accept the Democratic Progressive Party
government's offer to serve as chairman of SEF after leaving the KMT
position.
</P>
<P>
However, Siew said the report is totally untrue and urged the
media to stop engaging in such speculation.
</P>
<P>
Siew said that President Chen Shui-bian never offered him any
public offices and that he is not interested in accepting any such
offers.
</P>
<P>
Siew announced his decision to resign as KMT vice chairman in a
written statement on Wednesday, saying the move was taken in response
to KMT Chairman Lien Chan's call for changeover of the party
leadership and a request by party members to downsize the KMT's
organization.
</P>
<P>
Siew said that he had tendered resignation several times before
this but was rejected on each occasion and that he thinks the timing
is good for him to leave now.
</P>
<P>
Siew said although he no longer has any official post in the
party, he is still a member of the KMT and will continue to support
the development and reforms of the party.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the matter, Lien confirmed that Siew had made up his
mind to resign long ago and he thanked Siew for his contribution to
the party over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
According to KMT Secretary-General Lin Fong-cheng, Lien hopes
that Siew can finish his term, which is set to expire this August. He
added that Lien will try to contact Siew to discuss this possibility
with him.
</P>
<P>
Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng, who is also a KMT vice
chairman, expressed the hope that Siew could stay to assist Lien in
leading the party. Wang added that he thinks Siew is a perfect
candidate for the post of SEF chairman.

CANADA-BASED TAIWANESE BUSINESSPEOPLE OPPOSED TO ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Ottawa,  March 2 (CNA)
(By S.K.Wu and P.C.Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Taiwanese Chamber of Commerces in the
Canadian cities of Ottawa and Montreal recently released a statement
voicing their firm opposition to China's proposed anti-secession law.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the organization said that neither side of the
Taiwan Strait is subordinate to the other and that the two sides must
resolve the cross-strait differences in a rational and peaceful
manner through consultations.
</P>
<P>
The Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress
adopted last December a draft of the proposed law, and the congress
is set to review the draft at its annual plenary session slated to
open March 8.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that Beijing's unilateral enactment of an
anti-secession law, which is an attempt to dominate the development
of cross-strait relations in the future, is not consistent with the
current status quo in the Taiwan Strait, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that cross-strait relations might be improved in the
future as both sides of the strait reached an agreement on Lunar New
Year holiday direct charter flights and are planning to push for the
signing of a further agreement establishing a definite cross-strait
charter flights system as well as the holding of discussions on
other "three links" issues, the statement said that recent remarks
made by President Chen Shui-bian to urge the two sides to discuss the
signing of a peaceful agreement to replace the anti-secession law
have demonstrated the president's goodwill toward China.
</P>
<P>
Taiwanese businesspeople at home and abroad hope that Beijing can
respond to Chen's goodwill in order to make room for positive
interactions and better economic and trade exchanges between the two
sides of the strait, the statement continued, adding that if China
insists on enacting the law, this will cast a shadow over the
development of future cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
The statement called on Beijing not to enact the proposed law so
as to avoid escalating cross-strait tensions and creating obstacles
in exchanges between Taiwan and mainland China as well as
jeopardizing positive cross-strait interactions and opportunities to
resolve cross-strait disputes peacefully.
</P>
<P>
It also expressed the hope that the Canadian government and the
international community will work to prevent Beijing from enacting
the law so as to avoid destroying the current status quo in the
Taiwan Strait and undermining peace, stability and security in the
Pacific region and other parts of the world.

LEGISLATIVE YUAN TO PASS RESOLUTION AGAINST ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 3 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Legislative Yuan will pass a resolution
against Beijing's anti-secession legislation, Legislative Speaker
Wang Jin-pyng said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the announcement after a cross-party consultative
meeting to discuss certain critical legislative bills.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Wang said, the legislative whips of ruling
and opposition parties reached a consensus on adopting a resolution
to voice opposition to Beijing's so-called anti-secession law
targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the legislative caucuses of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and the opposition Kuomintang and the Taiwan
Solidarity Union have all presented their own versions for the
resolution.
</P>
<P>
"As the party whips have yet to come to terms on the wording of
the common resolution, they will meet again Friday to further discuss
the contents. Once a mutually acceptable version is worked out, it
will be put forth for passage at a legislative plenary session," Wang
said.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, the basic tone of the resolution will lie in
urging Beijing to respect Taiwan's identity and work together with
the island to maintain peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
The DPP caucus was the first to come up with a draft resolution
opposing Beijing's proposed anti-secession legislation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the consultative meeting, DPP legislative whip Chen
Ching-chun urged the opposition parties to support the DPP-initiated
draft resolution, titled "Defending the Republic of China's
Sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the Republic of China is an independent
sovereign state, the DPP draft resolution said the ROC does not
belong to the People's Republic of China and is ruled by a government
distinct from that of the PRC.
</P>
<P>
"And this status quo cannot be changed without the consent of the
people of Taiwan by a democratic referendum and should be respected
and safeguarded by all countries around the world including the the
PRC," the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
It further said any country which intends to challenge this
status quo, regardless of whether through legislation or policy
statements, and especially if by force, will be scathingly condemned
and fiercely opposed by the people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the proposed resolution is in line with the spirit of
the DPP's previous Resolution on Taiwan's Future as well as President
Chen Shui-bian's 2000 and 2004 inaugural speeches and the 10-point
consensus reached at the recent high-profile meeting between Chen and
opposition People First Party Chairman James Soong.

DEFENSE MINISTRY TO TAKE ANOTHER STAB AT PUBLICITY FOR U.S. ARMS DEAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 3 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of National Defense is to
increase its publicity and lobbying for a special budget for a major
military procurement plan, defense ministry officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The new wave of publicity will skirt sensitive political issues
and focus on national security and peace in the hope of winning
greater public backing, they said, admitting that last year's
promotion urging people to "save a cup of tea every day in exchange
for weapons" did little to further the defense ministry's cause.
</P>
<P>
This time around, Defense Minister Lee Jye, Chief of the General
Staff Gen. Lee Tien-yu and Chief of the Political Warfare Bureau Gen.
Hu Cheng-pu have decided to adopt a three-pronged strategy targeting
the public, the legislative caucuses and several individual
legislators to increase understanding of the issue, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will lobby hard at the Legislative Yuan in an effort
to win the support of a number of hardliners, they said. The defense
ministry intends to first push for the passage of the special statute
governing the major arms procurement project during the current
legislative session and then have the arms package budget bill
screened.
</P>
<P>
As a result of boycotts from the opposition "pan blue alliance, "
bills pertaining to the NT$610.8 billion (about US$18 billion) arms
procurement plan failed to be put on the agenda of the steering
committee 14 times before the previous legislature ended in January.
</P>
<P>
The huge budget spurred heated debate at the opposition-dominated
Legislative Yuan and provoked disapproval from the public due to the
government's strained financial situation.
</P>
<P>
With the opening of the sixth Legislative Yuan in February, Lee
said recently at a Spring Festival gathering with reporters that his
ministry is prepared to slash the budget for the deal to NT$590
billion to compromise with the "pan blue alliance" composed of the
Kuomintang, the People First Party and the New Party.
</P>
<P>
The price could be further lowered to NT$480 billion should a
final decision be made not to build the eight diesel-powered
submarines in Taiwan, Lee pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The "pan blue alliance" had asked the defense ministry to cut the
budget by at least NT$300 billion.

Better grading of medical facilities and
patient referrals must be implemented to streamline operations and
avoid wasting resources, Vice Premier Wu Rong-i said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The former president of the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research
made the comments during a seminar on the review and prospects of the
national health insurance system, which is 10 years old this year.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that it is important to have those who suffer moderate or
minor illnesses to seek medical treatment at local clinics or health
care units, instead of big hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Only by grading medical institutions and implementing patient
referrals can precious hospital resources be efficiently used for
patients with serious diseases, Wu explained.

<P>
Saying that "there's no free lunch, " Wu said that the national
health insurance is not a civic welfare program supported by the
national treasury, but is a kind of insurance, as its name implies.
All of those insured must pay for using the system's resources, the
vice premier stressed.

U.S. TO TAKE 'EXTRAORDINARY STEPS' FOR CROSS-STRAIT STABILITY: EXPERT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  March  2 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An American expert on cross-Taiwan
Strait issues urged leaders on both sides Wednesday to take into
consideration the well-being of their people and their relations with
the United States before making any decisions that may upset regional
stability.
</P>
<P>
Alan D. Romberg, senior associate and director of the East Asia
Program at the Henry L. Stimson Center, made the call in an article
entitled "Promoting Cross-Strait Stability, Avoiding Catastrophe, "
ahead of the passage of an "anti-secession law" by mainland China.
</P>
<P>
While both mainland China and Taiwan expect the United States to
take their sides, both will be disappointed because Washington will
only side with cross-strait stability, which is in the interests of
the United States, Romberg said.
</P>
<P>
According to Romberg, Washington will stand up to oppose any
moves by either side that are likely to destabilize the situation
across the Strait and will take "extraordinary steps" if necessary.
</P>
<P>
For example, during a meeting with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao in
December 2003, U.S. President George W. Bush publicly rebuked
President Chen Shui-bian for going ahead with his plan to hold a
referendum alongside the 2004 presidential election; and during the
cross-strait missile crisis in 1996, then-President Bill Clinton
dispatched two aircraft-carrier battle groups to areas near the
Taiwan Strait, Romberg noted.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that mainland China has been pondering enacting a
"unification law" or an "anti-secession law" since the 1990s, but
Beijing only started to put the wheels in motion last year after
President Chen pledged during his re-election campaign to hold a
referendum in 2006 for a new constitution.
</P>
<P>
By enacting the "anti-secession law," Beijing is trying to compel
present and future Chinese leaders to take military action if Taiwan
moves towards permanent separation from mainland China, he said.
</P>
<P>
Very often, Taiwan and China act from their respective
standpoints, prompting the other side to counteract, which feeds a
vicious circle across the Strait, he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged Beijing to take some constructive action, such as
considering allowing Taiwan to take part in the World Health
Organization as an observer, in order to facilitate positive
cross-strait developments.
</P>
<P>
If the "anti-secession law" is to dictate the use of
"non-peaceful means," insist on the "one country, two systems" format
for unification and even make supporting Taiwan independence a crime,
it is foreseeable as to how Taiwan will react, he said.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the United States will take an "extraordinary
step" like it did in the past if the content of this legislation is
worrying to Washington.

All 20 crew members aboard a
grounded Indonesian cargo ship are believed to be safe after some of
them were airlifted by helicopter to Penghu Island off Taiwan's
southwest coast Thursday, while the rest await rescue, coast guard
sources reported.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian bulk carrier "Shinko Ocean" sent out an SOS around
2 p.m. from waters some 14 nautical miles from Makung, Penghu after
the vessel ran aground because of engine failure and stormy weather.
</P>

A Seagull rescue helicopter took off from an air base in Chiayi,
southern Taiwan and successfully airlifted part of the crew to Makung
Airport, where they were transferred to two hospitals in Penghu for
treatment.
</P>
<P>
The Seagull shuttled back and forth from Penghu to transfer the
crew ashore.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian freighter was on its way from Malaysia to
Taichung, central Taiwan, when its engines failed. Stormy weather
then caused the captain of the ship to lose control and the vessel
eventually hit a rock formation in shallow water off Penghu Island.

According to the Hong Kong paper, Dai made the remarks Wednesday
after a travel market inspection tour of Kinmen and Matsu, both of
which lie closer to the southeastern mainland province of Fujian than
to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Mainland authorities formally allowed Fujian residents to make
pleasure trips to Kinmen last December and will soon allow Fujian
residents to travel to Matsu and Penghu for sightseeing. Moreover,
Dai said the Taiwan Affairs Office is also planning to allow
residents in other mainland provinces to make pleasure trips to the
three outlying islands in a gradual manner.
</P>
<P>
At present, Taiwan has only opened Kinmen and Matsu for direct
shipping links with Fujian, while Penghu, which lies close to Taiwan
proper, remains an off-limits area for direct contact with the
mainland.

GIO CHIEF WELCOMES U.S.-JAPAN CONCERN OVER TAIWAN SECURITY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Tokyo,  March 3 (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and  Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Republic of China Government Information
Office (GIO) Director-General Lin Chia-lung welcomed a recent joint
U.S.-Japan statement that cited Taiwan as a "joint strategic
objective" and said that the two countries have sent a clear anti-war
message to Beijing in doing so, a Japanese newspaper reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lin said in the report published by the Maichi Shimbun that the
two countries' inclusion of peace in the Taiwan Strait as a concern
in their joint statement represents a clear point in the Japan- U.S.
security alliance and that he very much welcomes the move which will
help lay a cornerstone of peace in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he pointed out, the two countries transmitted a
clear message to the Beijing leadership about their grave concerns
over peace across the Strait, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Beijing's plan to enact a proposed "anti-secession
law" in the middle of this month, Lin claimed that it will only pour
cold water on efforts to ease tensions between Taiwan and mainland
China, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin, the purpose of the Beijing's law is to empower
itself to define and alter the cross-strait status quo and to use it
to split the Taiwan people and increase its grip on Taiwan
businessmen operating in mainland China.
</P>
<P>
The law can also be used as an excuse by Beijing to attack Taiwan
and apply it to deal with the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands, which are
claimed by Taiwan, mainland China and Japan, he said.
</P>
<P>
The GIO head ascribed Beijing's scheme to the re-election of
President Chen Shui-bian in March 2004 out of its distrust of the
president's Taiwan-centric stance.
</P>
<P>
Describing the Taiwan-mainland charter flight service during the
lunar new year holidays as a part of President Chen's sunshine policy
to improve cross-strait ties, he said that Beijing's "anti-secession
law" will not only dampen Chen's peace-making efforts but will also
annoy the people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan government might be pushed by its angry people to
counter the "anti-secession law " by holding a defensive referendum
in protest against Beijing, he said, adding that it is now facing a
huge test at this juncture.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's National People's Congress is expected to pass the
"anti-secession law" in the middle of this month during its
10th plenary session, which will open on March 5.

BUSINESS GROUPS POSITIVE ABOUT CHEN-SOONG MEETING

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Business and industrial groups are very
positive about a recent meeting between President Chen Shui-bian and
opposition People First Party Chairman James Soong and its historical
significance in ending inter-party rivalry.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese National Federation of Industries, the General
Chamber of Commerce of the Republic of China, the Chinese National
Association of Industry and Commerce and other groups issued a
statement Thursday to hail the move for inter-party reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The groups said in the statement that there will be room for
economic development only if the political situation is stable,
adding that with the confrontation between the ruling and opposition
parties after the 2000 presidential election, which saw the first
power transition between different parties in Taiwan for over five
decades, the continued bickering between the ruling and opposition
parties has seriously undermined economic growth and social harmony
in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the people on the island favor
all kinds of voices but are opposed to rivalries and divisions; they
hope for inter-party reconciliation and an easing of cross-strait
tensions so that Taiwan can better develop.
</P>
<P>
It also said that the gist of democracy is to obey the views of
the majority. As past polls have shown that the majority of people on
Taiwan are in favor of maintaining the status quo, it said those who
are in favor of immediate independence are few.
</P>
<P>
Although the voice of the few should be given due respect, as
head of state, President Chen should listen to the voice of all the
people and not be dictated by a few of them, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Reconciliation instead of confrontation is the mainstream view of
the public, it also said, adding that business groups are happy to
see a truce between various political groups, and that the public was
happy to see the Chen-Soong meeting too, a mood reflected by the rise
in the stock and real estate markets.

'ANTI-SECESSION LAW' TO AFFECT CHINESE LIBERALS, DISSIDENTS: WANG DAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 3 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prominent Chinese democracy activist Wang
Dan predicted Thursday that lives of Chinese dissidents and liberal
intellectuals will become even more difficult after Beijing enacts
its "anti-secession law."
</P>
<P>
Wang, a Harvard University doctoral candidate who is currently on
a research project in Taiwan, said during a talk with Taipei media
Thursday that he has no idea why the Beijing leadership is enacting
the controversial "anti-secession law, " but he speculated that one
reason was an attempt to rein in the growing nationalism around
mainland China.
</P>
<P>
On whether and how the "anti-secession law" -- expected to be
passed by Beijing's National People's Congress March 14 -- will
impact cross-Taiwan Strait relations, Wang said that this will only
be known after the articles of the law are publicized and examined.
</P>
<P>
Wang, whose six-month research project at Academia Sinica's
Institute of Modern History is scheduled to conclude Saturday, said
that he is confident in Taiwan's democratization despite the fact
that political party conflicts have been rife.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's democratization, although raucous, has always been a
window of inspiration for mainland China, Wang noted.
</P>
<P>
On the development of cross-strait relations, Wang said that
improving cross-strait relations is not an issue simply for the
government to address, pointing out that it is a problem for the
people from both sides to tackle.
</P>
<P>
He called for the building of a platform on which intellectuals
from the two sides can talk to try to break the cross-strait
political deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Wang's news conference was arranged by the Taipei Society, which
was founded by a group of liberal scholars who oppose nuclear plants
and social injustice. Wang is the only member of the group from
overseas.
</P>
<P>
In response to Wang's call, Ku Chung-hua, an executive director
of the Taipei Society, said that the group will begin this year to
push for the establishment of a private cross-strait dialogue
platform to allow intellectuals from both sides first to understand
each other and then contribute in efforts to address the cross-strait
political stalemate.
</P>
<P>
On opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Vice Chairman P.K. Chiang's
forthcoming visit to Guangdong to lay a wreath on the tomb of the
Republic of China founding father Dr. Sun Yat-sen, Wang suggested
that when the KMT is engaging the Chinese authorities, the KMT people
encourage the Chinese communists to accelerate China's
democratization, including pushing for the freedom of speech.
</P>
<P>
Wang, founder of the Chinese Constitutional Reform Association in
the United States, has visited Taiwan many times since he first set
foot on the island on March 18, 1999.
</P>
<P>
He was in Taipei in January 2003 to launch his two new books
written in Chinese -- one a collection of poems and the other a work
of prose -- both published by Taipei's Locus Publishing Co.
</P>
<P>
He was in Taipei again in July 2003 for six weeks at the
invitation of the Taipei City Government as an artist-in-residence.
</P>
<P>
Wang was jailed in July 1989 for his part in the pro-democracy
demonstrations and was released in February 1993. He was arrested
again in October 1996 and sentenced to a further 11-year prison term.
</P>
<P>
In April of 1998, he was released on parole on medical grounds
and permitted to travel to the United States for treatment -- a move
that effectively sent him into exile.

LEGISLATURE TO CREATE TASK FORCE ON CROSS-STRAIT AFFAIRS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 3 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A special task force will be assembled by
legislators from across the party spectrum to address cross-Taiwan
Strait issues, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that legislators from the various parties have agreed
to create the task force with the principle of representation
according to the ratio of political parties' presence in the
legislature. The members will be decided by March 20. The task force
will be made up of the legislative speaker, vice speaker and 23
legislators.
</P>
<P>
However, Lai Chin-teh, caucus whip of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party, cautioned in the legislature that matters relating
to cross-strait ties are the responsibility of the president
according to the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Lai urged respect for the Constitution, adding that if the
cross-strait task force affects the purview of the president, then it
will undermine the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
He also asked that the task force not be formed until after
mainland China' s National People's Congress debates its proposed
"anti-secession law" so as to avoid possible trouble.
</P>
<P>
But Wang said that this will not be a problem, adding that 
mainland China's National People's Congress, Beijing's rubber-stamp
parliament, is expected to deliberate on the proposed law, which some
observers say could be an attempt by Beijing to lay a legal basis for
the use of force against Taiwan should it declare independence, and
approve of it even before Taiwan's cross-strait task force is
created.

CAL TO BEGIN FLIGHTS TO VIENNA IN MAY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 3 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China Airlines (CAL) , Taiwan's largest
carrier, will inaugurate flight services to Vienna in May, a company
spokesman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Initially, the spokesman said, CAL will operate two Taipei-Vienna
flights per week. In the future, he added, the company plans to add
an additional flight per week.
</P>
<P>
According to a Taiwan-Austria aviation agreement signed in 1990,
Taiwan can operate seven weekly flights, regardless of whether they
are passenger or cargo flights, between Taipei and Vienna. Over the
past 15 years, only EVA Airways, Taiwan's second-largest carrier, has
been allowed to fly the route. At present, EVA operates three
passenger and two cargo flights.
</P>
<P>
In September 2004, the Taiwan-Austria aviation accord was revised
to allow a second Taiwan airline to ply the route. The revised pact
does not impose any restrictions on the number of cargo flights,
while raising the number of passenger flights to seven per week.
</P>
<P>
Deducting the three passenger flights that EVA now operates, the
Civil Aeronautics Administration assigns the remaining four evenly to
CAL and EVA.
</P>
<P>
EVA said it plans to increase its Taipei-Vienna passenger flights
from the current three to five by mid-May.
</P>
<P>
Despite high gasoline prices and rising interest rates, CAL
posted a record high pre-tax profit of NT$4.02 billion last year on a
business turnover of NT$96.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
CAL President Wei Hsing-hsiung said the airline's business
turnover is expected to break the NT$100 billion mark for the first
time this year, with pre-tax profit expected to hit NT$4.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
EVA also set new records in its business turnover and profit last
year, with its pre-tax profit amounting to NT$3.6 billion on a
turnover of NT$82.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
Both CAL and EVA executives said they are optimistic about the
civil aviation market this year because regular charter flights
across the Taiwan Strait are likely to open in the not-too-distant
future.

SENIOR PRESIDENTIAL ADVISER TO STAY AFTER TALK WITH PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 3 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Senior presidential adviser Wu Li-pei said
Thursday that after talking with the president, he has decided not to
step down from his post.
</P>
<P>
Wu, a long-time advocate of Taiwan democracy and independence,
made the remarks after nearly two hours of discussions with President
Chen Shui-bian at the Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
Wu offered to resign over a recent meeting between Chen and
opposition People First Party Chairman James Soong in which the
president reaffirmed his "five noes, " which are: no declaration of
independence, no change of the nation's official name, no inclusion
of the "state-to-state" theory on cross-strait relations in the
nation's Constitution, no national referendum on changing the status
of the island regarding unification or independence, and no abolition
of the National Unification Guidelines or National Unification
Council.
</P>
<P>
Wu noted that Soong said "Taiwan independence is not an option"
after his meeting with Chen to the dismay of many pro-Taiwan
independence supporters, but the president did not respond or
clarify these remarks, disappointing and upsetting a multitude of
supporters of the president overseas. This was the reason why he
offered to resign, he added.
</P>
<P>
But Wu said that the president explained to him during the
meeting that he had not changed his long-term goals nor had he
reneged on the ideals of the Taiwanese.
</P>
<P>
But as the momentum for inter-party reconciliation has just begun
to build up, it is not appropriate for him to rebut the other party
if the latter has expressed a different stance, according to the
president's remarks to Wu.
</P>
<P>
The president regretted that his reticence has caused
misunderstandings, referring to the recent backlash from
pro-independence supporters, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed to him that to avoid the administration
being mired in constant bickering between the ruling and the
opposition parties, and to allow the government to move forward, he
needed to promote inter-party reconciliation and cooperation, Wu
added.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that he suggested to the president that he should come
forward to mend fences given the number of misunderstandings. Wu said
that he felt that the president will do this eventually at the right
time.
</P>
<P>
But he also said that his staying on does not mean that he agrees
thoroughly with the 10-point agreement reached between Chen and
Soong.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that he agreed with Chen that it is impossible to change
the country's name from the "Republic of China" to the "Republic of
Taiwan" during his term, adding that such a change could only be
achieved by two methods -- revolution or legal procedure, and only
legal procedure applies to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, if the president is unable to achieve that during his
term, he should talk about something that everyone can strive for, Wu
added.
</P>
<P>
Wu also said that though he is staying on, he won't be of much
use, and the president said that he is considering formulating a
mechanism to have presidential advisers provide views regularly and
take part in discussions prior to the formulation of national
policies.

TSU ACCUSED OF CUTTING DPP'S THROAT FOR TRYING TO WOO MEMBERS AWAY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 3 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
officials Thursday accused their ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) , of cutting one another's throats after the TSU openly
encouraged DPP members to join the party.
</P>
<P>
Angered by recent statements by President Chen Shui-bian that he
has no plan to declare independence for Taiwan and change the
official name of the country during his term, officials of the
pro-independence TSU made a public call on Wednesday for DPP members
to join the TSU.
</P>
<P>
In reaction, DPP Deputy Secretary-General Yen Wan-chin criticized
the TSU's move as violating the principle of fair competition between
different political parties.
</P>
<P>
Yen said the TSU should not have tried to expand it size by
making the other party "lose blood" and that he believes the majority
of DPP members will not support such an idea, either.
</P>
<P>
DPP spokesman Cheng Wen-tsan said it is undemocratic of the TSU
to mislead the public with mistaken information and attack the
president with emotional language.
</P>
<P>
Cheng urged the TSU to stop the campaign immediately for the sake
of its brotherhood with the DPP and work on their common objective of
attaining political stability in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Disagreeing with Yen and Cheng, TSU Chairman Shu Chin-chiang said
his party has no reason to reject anyone who identifies with the
party's ideals.
</P>
<P>
Shu denied the TSU has taken the initiative to woo DPP members
away.
</P>
<P>
Just as the TSU has shown respect for the DPP and President Chen,
the party expects the DPP to pay due respect to former President Lee
Teng-hui, who is the TSU's spiritual leader, and other
pro-independence groups, Shu said.
</P>
<P>
President Chen said during a teleconference with a group of
European parliamentarians on Tuesday that it is unnecessary for
Taiwan to declare independence and that it would also be impossible
to change the name of the country from the Republic of China to the
"Republic of Taiwan" during his term.
</P>
<P>
The TSU promotes calling the country "Taiwan" and drafting a new
constitution, things that Chen said Lee would not have been able to
achieve if he were still president today, a comment that irked the
TSU.
</P>
<P>
The TSU is also unhappy with Chen's meeting with opposition
People First Party Chairman James Soong last week, in which Chen made
similar assurances.

JAPAN TO WAIVE VISA REQUIREMENT FOR TAIWAN TOURISTS FROM MARCH 11

<P>
Japan will waive its visa requirements for
Taiwan tourists from March 11 through Sept. 25 as part of its efforts
to attract visitors to the 2005 World Exposition in Aichi Prefecture
in central Japan, government sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transportation
(MLIT) has finalized the visa-waiving plan and will present it for
final approval at a Japanese Cabinet meeting Friday, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The eco-friendly Aichi Expo is scheduled to open March 25 and
last through Sept. 25. To attract more foreign visitors, Japan has
decided to offer visa-free entry to South Korean and Taiwan tourists
between March and September. South Korea is Japan's largest source of
foreign tourists and Taiwan comes in second.
</P>
<P>
As Japan does not maintain formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan,
the Japanese Diet passed special regulations Feb. 16 to allow Taiwan
citizens to enter Japan without a visa for a maximum 90-day stay
between March 11 and Sept. 25.

EXPORTERS CHALLENGED BY SURGING LOCAL CURRENCY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 3 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the face of a surging new Taiwan dollar
in recent days, domestic export-oriented businesses are urging the
government to effectively curb the inflow of hot money to help
maintain their competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
Hsu Sheng-hsiung, chairman of the Taiwan Electrical and
Electronic Manufacturers' Association, said that the recent
stronger-than-expected appreciation of the local currency has taken
many Taiwan companies by surprise and he called on the government to
take countermeasures to stem serious consequences over the long term.
</P>
<P>
According to Hsu, many domestic businesses had expected the local
unit to rise to around 31.5 against the U.S. dollar by this time, but
its rapid gains over the past week have dealt a blow to them, he
said, pointing out that gradual strengthening is more acceptable to
them.
</P>
<P>
The new Taiwan dollar ended at 30.863 against the U.S. unit
Thursday in the Taipei foreign exchange market, breaking the 31.0
mark and moving up slightly by NT$0.015 from the previous day's
finish.
</P>
<P>
Yeh I-chang, secretary-general of the Taiwan Silk and Filament
Weaving Industrial Association, said a continuously appreciating local
currency has become a major problem for may export-oriented textile
makers.
The situation is forcing them to buy production materials in new
Taiwan dollars but sell their goods abroad in U.S. currency, he said.
</P>
<P>
The rapid surge in value of the local currency has slashed their
profits, Yeh said, noting that what they earn is hardly enough to pay
what they lose in currency exchanges.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the development to the inflow of international hot
money speculating on a stronger new Taiwan dollar over a weaker U.S.
dollar and he called on the government to clamp down on such
speculation to prevent fallout on domestic companies.
</P>
<P>
Kevin Grice, a senior economist at American Express Bank,
forecast a day earlier that the new Taiwan dollar is expected to rise
to 30.0 to the greenback by the end of this year, marking a departure
from other analysts who predicted that the local unit will further
rise to a range of between 26.0 and 28.0 by that time.
</P>
<P>
Grice contended that mainland China's renminbi will be allowed to
float in a narrow range of 5 percent this year and that the new
Taiwan dollar will continue to strengthen as long as the renminbi is
under pressure to go up in value on a weak U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that Taiwan's central bank will intervene
gradually to ward off a sharp appreciation of the local unit and
maintain a stable economic growth rate and that the new Taiwan dollar
will not pick up to the 26.0 - 28.0 level this year.
</P>
<P>
He forecast that the Taiwan economy will expand by 5 percent for
2005, higher than the 4.21 percent target set by the Cabinet-level
Directorate of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, given that Taiwan's
unemployment has improved and that the average interest rate of
Taiwan banks remains low.

The Times: Computer tax set to replace TV
licence fee.

The BBC licence fee should be replaced by a tax on the ownership of
a personal computer instead of a television, ministers said yesterday. 

Tessa Jowell told the BBC that the licence fee would be retained for at
least another ten years until 2017 in return for abolishing the Board of
Governors. But the Culture Secretary conceded that technological advances
would mean that a fee based on "television ownership could become
redundant". 



Financial Times: BBC told board of governors to be axed.

The BBC paid the price for the governance failures highlighted
in the Hutton report when Tessa Jowell, culture secretary, on
Wednesday branded its 78-year-old system of self-regulation
"unsustainable" and scrapped its board of governors in favour
of an independent trust. 

But it escaped a far more dramatic overhaul when the green
paper, which paves the way for the renewal of the corporation's
royal charter in 2007, concluded that the BBC should be allowed
to retain the licence fee until 2016 in return for exhibiting a greater
commitment to public service broadcasting and driving the
switchover to digital TV services.

PRESIDENT'S MENTOR CALLS FOR STOP TO IN-FIGHTING
</HEADLINE>

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian's mentor Lee
Hong-hsi called Thursday for a stop to in-fighting among the
pro-independence camp and some members of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) over Chen's recent "no national name-change"
statement.
</P>
<P>
Lee, who was Chen's lecturer at National Taiwan University and is
currently superintendent of Chen's Ketagalan Institute, urged members
of the "pan-green camp" formed by the DPP, the Taiwan Solidarity
Union and some pro-Taiwan independence activists residing overseas,
to be rational and considerate toward Chen's statement that it will
be impossible during his term to change the official name of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that the gist of democracy is to obey the views of the
majority. Since the DPP fared badly in the Dec. 11 legislative
elections and the majority of people of Taiwan, according to recent
opinion polls, are in favor of maintaining the status quo while those
who are in favor of immediate independence are few, the president had
no option but to listen to the people and call a halt to his plans
for a name-change and constitutional re-engineering, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after several pro-independence senior
presidential advisers threatened to resign as an expression of their
anger with Chen's statement and his recent meeting with opposition
People First Party Chairman James Soong in which they agreed to
continue to promote inter-party and cross-Taiwan Strait
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Although Chen was determined to push for constitutional
re-engineering and a name-change, Lee said that as head of state,
Chen must listen to the voice of the people and follow the mainstream
view of society.
</P>
<P>
Describing Taiwan's diplomatic situation in the international
community as a small boat in a stormy sea, Lee appealed to all
members of the "pan-green camp" to throw their support behind the
president, who has been carefully piloting the ship of state.
</P>
<P>
It would be worthy if the president's efforts can win consensus
and support from the majority of the people, who can in turn help
tide him over the difficulties in steering the country in the coming
three years, according to Lee.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that it is cherishable and "exceptional in Taiwan" to
find a politician like Chen who loves his people, has a clear mind
and always demonstrates grass-roots modesty.

LEGISLATURE MIGHT PASS ANTI-ANNEXATION LAW: DPP WHIP
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 3 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Legislative Yuan does not rule out the
possibility of enacting an anti-annexation law to counter mainland
China's so-called anti-secession law, a legislative whip of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar on the possible impact of the mainland's
proposed anti-secession legislation targeting Taiwan, Lai Ching-teh
said the legislative caucuses of ruling and opposition parties have
reached a consensus on adopting a common resolution urging Beijing to
abandon its plan.
</P>
<P>
"This indicates that lawmakers from both the ruling and
opposition camps have felt the pinch of Beijing's new legislative
plan and are determined to take action against it, " Lai said, adding
that if the content of Beijing's new law is too outrageous, the
legislature will not rule out the possibility of passing an
anti-annexation law in retaliation.
</P>
<P>
The National People's Congress -- the mainland's rubber-stamp
parliament -- is expected to screen and approve the law in mid-March.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Lo Chih-cheng, chief executive of
the National Policy Research Institute, and Lin Cheng-yi, director of
the International Relations Institute of National Chengchi
University, suggested that if Beijing passes a "grave" anti-secession
law, Taiwan should hold a referendum simultaneously with the year-end
local government chief elections to express its strong opposition to
Beijing's policy toward Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lo and Lin said the referendum could ask the people whether they
agree with Beijing's "one country, two systems" formula as the only
option for Taiwan's future. Such a referendum, they claimed, would
not violate President Chen Shui-bian's promise of no referendum on
cross-Taiwan Strait unification or Taiwan independence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mainland Affairs Council Vice Chairman Huang Wei-feng
said the government has prepared comprehensive response measures to
cope with Beijing's anti-secession legislation.
</P>
<P>
Describing the anti-secession law is a "war authorization" law,
Huang said the legislation would give the People's Liberation Army a
"blank check" to attack Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"Such a law would hurt the Taiwan people and hinder regional
peace, " Huang said, adding that it would be an "evil law" for both
Taiwan and the mainland.
</P>
<P>
With the enactment of such a law, Huang said, the mainland would
lose flexibility in dealing with cross-strait affairs.
</P>
<P>
While the government has worked out response measures to cope
with various possible mainland versions of the law, Huang said, the
package cannot be divulged at the moment.
</P>
<P>
"Premature revelation would only give mainland China a pretext
for justifying its planned legislation," Huang said.

TAIWAN TO BECOME 'SILK ROAD' TO EAST ASIA: ECONOMIC PLANNERS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 3 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government will develop Taiwan into a
research and development center in East Asia and a new "silk road"
for multinational companies venturing into the East Asian market,
according to a report issued Thursday by the Council for Economic
Planning and Development, the government's economic planners.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the combined exports of East Asian countries
accounted for 25.8 percent of the world's total foreign trade in
2003, the report says foreign trade between countries in the region
made up 12.8 percent of the world's total, following Europe's 23.3
percent and surpassing the 8.5 percent recorded for the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Trade among the countries of East Asia has grown so fast in the
period between 2000 and 2003, it has outpaced trade between the
region and the United States, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The trade surplus accumulated by Taiwan, Singapore, and South
Korea against mainland China and Hong Kong hit US$40.4 billion in
1996 and US$60.8 billion in 2003, the report says.
</P>
<P>
Along with the emergence of the mainland and India as major
economic powers in Asia, the report says, a division of labor among
Asian states is taking shape and the continent is expected to turn
into a world economic powerhouse in the near future.
</P>
<P>
To brace for the new development, the report says the government
is making good use of the island's well-developed infrastructure and
advanced technology to develop the country into a research and
development center in the region and a gateway for multinational
companies breaking into the East Asian market.

Taipei,  March 3 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)

<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian decried Thursday
Beijing's proposed anti-secession law as a dangerous move to alter
the status quo across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Chen told a group of foreign ministers from Taiwan's allies in
Central America that the mainland will use the law to provide a legal
basis for a possible attack on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the mainland is targeting Taiwan with 706 missiles,
which poses a serious threat to the stability in the Asia-Pacific
region, Chen called on the international community not to turn a
blind eye to the mainland's attempts to expand its territory because
of the potential economic benefit in tapping the mainland market.
</P>
<P>
The ministers were in Taiwan for an annual economic conference.

<P>
China is missing the target in its attempt
to rob Taiwan of its option for pursuing independence with an
anti-secession law, former President Lee Teng-hui said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Formosa Television, Lee said Taiwan has long
been a sovereign state that does not belong to China and does not
need to be split from any other country. He also raised the rather
obvious question of how Beijing can apply its laws outside its
jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
As China's National People's Congress is set to review and enact
the anti-secession law before March 15, Lee called on Taiwanese to
take to the streets March 6 to protest the proposed legislation and
to show to the world that Taiwan is not a part of China.
</P>
<P>
As long as the people of the island unite, Lee said, "we can show
to the world that China's anti-secession law is not grounded on any
legal basis."

A Panamanian cargo ship that ran
aground near Penghu Thursday due to engine failure and stormy weather
sank at around 1 a.m. Friday, with all but one of the 20 crew members
having been rescued, coast guard authorities reported.
</P>
<P>
The first mate of the Panamanian bulk carrier "Shinko Ocean, "
named Siman Juntak, remains missing after having fallen overboard
during Thursday's mishap. Rescuers continue their search for Juntak.
</P>
<P>
The nineteen other crew members have been safely helicoptered to
Makung, the capital of Penghu, after being rescued by the Republic of
China Seagull Squad.
</P>
<P>
The bulk carrier sent out an SOS at around 2 p.m. Thursday from
waters some 14 nautical miles from Penghu, located off Taiwan's
southwest coast, after the vessel ran aground because of engine
failure and stormy weather.
</P>
<P>
A Seagull rescue helicopter took off from an air base in Chiayi,
southern Taiwan and successfully airlifted the crew, in marathon
back-and-forth shuttles, to Makung Airport, where they were
transferred to two hospitals in Penghu for treatment.
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian freighter was on its way from Malaysia to
Taichung, central Taiwan, transporting logs, when its engines failed.
Stormy weather then caused the captain of the ship to lose control,
and the vessel eventually hit a rock formation in shallow waters off
Penghu Island.
</P>
<P>
The ship then drifted further away from the northeastern coast of
Makung before sinking at around 1 a.m. Friday as a result of leakage,

NO BAN ON FARM PRODUCE EXPORTS TO CHINA: MAC

<P>
The government has not imposed any ban on
exports of agricultural products to mainland China, a senior mainland
affairs official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mainland Affairs Council Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san was
responding to a recent announcement by mainland Chinese authorities
that they will offer Taiwan farmers greater access to the mainland
market.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said Taiwan has not banned sales of locally produced
agricultural products to mainland China. However, Chiu said that due
to mainland China's tariffs and non-tariff trade barriers, such as
restrictions in marketing, customs clearance and quarantine, Taiwan's
agricultural exports to mainland China have consistently been lower
than its agricultural imports from the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that farm produce has a relatively short shelf life,
Chiu said distribution channels are very important in farm trade.
</P>
<P>
"Unless mainland China provides easier and more convenient
transportation and distribution channels, Taiwan's farm goods exports
to the mainland are not expected to grow substantially with just lip
service from Beijing," Chiu said.

DPP AFFIRMS PRESIDENT'S RECENT MEETING WITH SOONG
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) caucus in the Legislative Yuan said Friday that it fully
supports President Chen Shui-bian's move to seek inter-party
reconciliation and expressed the hope of ending the row triggered by
Chen's recent meeting with People First Party (PFP) Chairman James
Soong.
</P>
<P>
The DPP caucus made the remarks amid criticism from some quarters
within the DPP and from its ally, the pro-independence Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU), of the Chen-Soong meeting last Thursday in
which the president reaffirmed the "five noes" pledge, including no
declaration of Taiwan independence and no change of the nation's
official name.
</P>
<P>
Ker Chien-ming, executive director of the DPP's Central Policy
Committee, said the party supports the president's intentions of
pursuing inter-party reconciliation and stable politics through the
holding of the meeting with Soong.
</P>
<P>
As the National People's Congress, mainland China's rubber-stamp
parliament, will soon review the proposed "anti-secession law" aimed
at Taiwan, Ker said the ruling and opposition parties should unite to
face the "national crisis."
</P>
<P>
Ker said that the DPP is willing to accept the criticism from the
TSU with humility. He also invited the opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
and the PFP to join a DPP-sponsored "Protect Taiwan, Oppose
Annexation" rally set to take place in Taipei Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, several DPP legislators issued a joint statement
Friday to voice opposition to the proposed anti-secession law, urging
the leaders of the opposition parties to declare their stance
clearly.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Pan Meng-an said that on the eve of Beijing's
enactment of the anti-secession law, KMT Chairman Lien Chan is
planning to send KMT Vice Chairman P. K. Chiang to head a delegation
to the mainland, which Pan said will send the wrong message to
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Another DPP legislator, Huang Wei-tze, claimed that Legislative
Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng and Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou -- both of
whom are KMT vice chairmen -- are ambivalent about Beijing's
proposed law, and called for them to unequivocally state their
opposition.
</P>
<P>
Several legislators also urged the government to send lobbying 
delegations to the United States, Japan and European Union to explain
the government's stance.

ROC FINANCIAL MINISTER SOLICITS FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN NEW YORK
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
New York,  March 3 (CNA)
(By C.Y. Tseng and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Republic of China's top financial
official said Thursday in New York that Taiwan's financial reforms
will change the structure of the country's financial market and that
this change will be to the island's advantage in competing with China
to attract foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Financial Affairs Lin Chuan, at the head of a
delegation visiting the city, made the comments while introducing
Taiwan's financial reforms and investment opportunities to local
businesspeople and investors at a seminar.
</P>
<P>
Lin expressed the hope that by attending the seminar, foreign
investors can better understand that Taiwan does not necessarily want
to sell its state-run banks and that they can instead invest in the
banks by means of joint ventures, technology transfers or the
purchase of stocks in the banks.
</P>
<P>
On competition with mainland China to attract foreign investment,
Lin said that Taiwan's stance is to open its financial market and let
market forces decide the value of investments.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the delegation's visit is to give foreign investors a
better understanding of the changes in Taiwan's financial market,
particularly the policies regarding future consolidation and
privatization of the state-run banks, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 200 representatives from international investment
institutions and agencies as well as local businesspeople and
investors attended the seminar to listen to introductions made by
Lin, Thomas Yeh, vice chairman of the Council for Economic Planning
and Development under the Executive Yuan, and a ranking official from
the Financial Supervision Commission on Taiwan's financial climate
and financial reform, and its policies concerning state-run banks'
privatization and consolidation.
</P>
<P>
The ROC Ministry of Finance has actively worked on the
consolidation and privatization of state-run banks since President
Chen Shui-bian expressed last year the hope that the number of
state-run banks in Taiwan should be halved to six within a year.
</P>
<P>
Other members of the delegation include top executives from

MAC VICE CHAIRMAN WARNS OF GRAVE CONSEQUENCES OF ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  4  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice
Chairman Chiu Tan-san urged Beijing Friday not to enact its proposed
anti-secession law, warning of serious consequences if it does so.
</P>
<P>
Chiu made the remarks at a regular weekly news conference
</P>
<P>
Claiming that enactment of the proposed anti-secession law would
clear the way for a mainland Chinese attack against Taiwan at any
time, alter the status quo across the Taiwan Strait, undermine peace
and security in East Asia, and hinder cross-strait exchanges, Chiu
urged Beijing to think twice before doing so.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said that the MAC, Taiwan's top agency in charge of mainland
China policy, is collecting all relevant information on the contents
of the anti-secession law. He added that the agency has yet to work
out countermeasures.
</P>
<P>
Responding to questions on whether enactment of the
anti-secession law would affect the promotion of cargo services
between the two sides of the strait, Chiu asserted that it would
certainly cause pressure on two-way exchanges, as Taiwan is a
pluralistic society, in which freedom of speech and basic human
rights are fully protected.
</P>
<P>
The MAC vice chairman pointed out that the government must make
the people of Taiwan and the mainland leadership aware of the serious
consequences if the law is enacted.
</P>
<P>
The National People's Congress, mainland China's rubber-stamp
parliament, is expected to enact the law in the middle of this month
after it opens its 10th plenary session Saturday.

NAME-CHANGE SHOULD NOT BECOME IDEOLOGICAL: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 4 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Friday the issue
concerning changing the country's official name should not be made to
become an ideological argument.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to legislators during a legislative interpellation
session, Hsieh proposed that the issue be put aside until a
consciousness of common destiny is established in Taiwan so as to
reduce the controversies surrounding the issue.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh agreed that it would be convenient and practical to change
the country's name to "Taiwan" from the "Republic of China" as the
current name can be abbreviated to become "China."
</P>
<P>
However, Hsieh pointed out that Taiwan faces diplomatic deadlock
resulting from an international isolation campaign against the island
initiated by mainland China, which claims "Taiwan is part of the
People's Republic of China."
</P>
<P>
In these circumstances, it is difficult for Taiwan to expand its
foreign relations regardless of whether is uses the name "Republic of
China" or "Taiwan," Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
According to Hsieh, the pro-independence movement in Taiwan is
confusing the international community, making many countries believe
that Taiwan is not yet an independent country and that it is now
trying to gain independence from the PRC.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Taiwan should from now on avoid calling for
independence and instead emphasize that the ROC is an independent and
sovereign state separate from the PRC and that it is not necessary to
declare independence from any country, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said another reason for Taiwan to follow this course is its
own security, as it needs to consider the possible reaction of the
mainland, which has vowed to take military action against the island
if it were to declare independence.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh's remarks were apparently aimed at quelling widespread
anger among pro-independence hard-liners with recent statements made
by President Chen Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
Chen told a group of European parliamentarians in a
teleconference earlier this week that it is unnecessary for Taiwan to
declare independence and that it is not possible to change the
official name of the country to "Republic of Taiwan" during his term
in light of the currrent political reality on the island.
</P>
<P>
Chen made similar assurances during a meeting with opposition
People First Party Chairman James Soong last week.

BEIJING URGED NOT TO HARM STABILITY IN THE TAIWAN STRAIT
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh expressed hope Friday
that China will not make the decision to harm stability in the Taiwan
Strait.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the remarks at the Legislative Yuan while
referring to China's preparations to enact an anti-secession law.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the Executive Yuan already made a serious
statement Wednesday to voice its strong opposition to the proposed
law, Hsieh said the Legislative Yuan should also adopt unanimously an
"anti-annexation law" to counter China's proposed bill.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the ruling and opposition parties differ in
their methods of expressing their stances, they are united in their
determination to support the adoption of an anti-annexation law, the
premier claimed.
</P>
<P>
The Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress
adopted last December a draft of the anti-secession law and the
congress is set to review the draft and pass it into law at its
annual plenary session slated to open March 8.

TSU DRUMS UP SUPPORT FOR ANTI-ANNEXATION DEMONSTRATION

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legislators of the opposition pro-Taiwan
independence Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) urged the public Friday to
take part Sunday in an anti-annexation demonstration in Kaohsiung,
southern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Several TSU legislators spoke in the Legislative Yuan, urging the
public to oppose Beijing's so-called anti-secession law that
will soon be reviewed and approved by the National People's Congress,
Beijing's rubber-stamp parliament.
</P>
<P>
To drum up public support, they also held signs bearing
"anti-annexation, protect Taiwan" slogans outside the legislature,
donned headbands and displayed "306 anti-annexation" stickers on
their faces.
</P>
<P>
Lo Chih-ming, caucus whip of the TSU in the legislature, urged
the public, whether they are in favor of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and its ally the TSU, or the opposition
alliance of the Kuomintang (KMT) , People First Party (PFP) and the
New Party, to either join a "protect Taiwan and oppose annexation "
rally in Taipei Sunday sponsored by the DPP or take part in a "306
anti-annexation" demonstration held by the TSU in Kaohsiung on the
same day.
</P>
<P>
Lo said it is high time that all parties put aside their
differences and jointly stand against Beijing's anti-secession law,
which seeks to lay a legal basis for the use of force against Taiwan
should the island declare independence.
</P>
<P>
Noting that former President Lee Teng-hui, the TSU's spiritual
leader, will attend the Kaohsiung demonstration, Lo expressed hope
that KMT Chairman Lien Chan, PFP Chairman James Soong and President
Chen Shui-bian will also join the demonstration.

NEW PUBLICITY MATERIALS ON ARMS PROCUREMENT SENT TO LEGISLATURE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 4 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of National Defense delivered
a new set of publicity materials to the Legislative Yuan Friday in a
fresh attempt to lobby for lawmakers' support for a NT$610.8 billion
(US$18.23 billion) arms procurement package from the United States.
</P>
<P>
The 13-page booklet underlines the theme of "hope and peace" and
uses simple images to illustrate the connection between the arms
procurement and national security.
</P>
<P>
It makes a clear difference from the controversial material
released by the ministry last year that used a large quantity of
statistics and claimed that the cost of the package would be equal to
"one glass of pearl milk tea every day" per person in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The booklet emphasizes that it would be most appropriate for the
government to finance the arms procurement in the form of a special
budget because it would squeeze other spending if the package were
included in the government's regular budget.
</P>
<P>
The special budget proposed by the Cabinet to buy six Patriot
PAC-III anti-missile batteries, eight diesel-electric submarines and
a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft was shelved by the
previous legislature owing to objections from the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and People First Party, which
argued that the weapons were unnecessary and too expensive.
</P>
<P>
The budget bill is expected to remain a centerpiece in the new
legislature that started Feb. 1.

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian praised Friday the
domestic bicycle industry for setting a textbook model for Taiwan
companies in their quest for industrial upgrading and business
expansion.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while giving a speech at the opening of the
2005 Taipei Cycle Show at the World Trade Center that will run
through March 7.
</P>
<P>
Chen recalled his childhood riding a bicycle on adventures as a
fascinating and exciting experience and expressed hope that his
grandsons will grow up to enjoy the same happiness as he did as a
youngster.
</P>
<P>
The president encouraged local governments to build bicycle
pathways in urban areas to allow their citizens to ride safely -- an
ideal way for commuters that is both healthy and non-polluting.
</P>
<P>
He also hailed Taiwan bike makers, saying that their efforts and
innovation have turned what was formerly a cheap commodity into a
high-priced product sold in exclusive shops.
</P>
<P>
This year's exhibition, the 18th of its kind, has drawn
participants from 620 companies in 29 countries to display their
sophisticated bikes in 2,019 booths -- a more than 20 percent
increase over last year's number.
</P>

LEGISLATIVE YUAN URGES BEIJING TO RE-THINK ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Legislative Yuan drafted a statement
Friday urging China to re-think its proposed anti-secession law
targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The wording of the statement was moderate as it adopted mostly
the versions of the opposition Kuomintang and the Non-Partisan
Solidarity Union. Versions produced by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party -- which says that the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait are under separate rule -- and by the pro-independence Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) , which states that "Taiwan is not part of
China," were not included in the resolution.
</P>
<P>
The statement is expected to be passed as a resolution in a full
Legislative Yuan floor meeting next Tuesday at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
The statement says that the Legislative Yuan is issuing a
proposed resolution on behalf of the Taiwan people on the
anti-secession law that will soon be reviewed and approved by the
National People's Congress, Beijing's rubber-stamp parliament.
</P>
<P>
The proposed resolution says that the Republic of China, since
its founding in 1912, has been a "sovereign, independent county" and
any move to unilaterally change the status quo or try to denigrate
the sovereignty of the nation will run counter to the common will of
the Taiwan people and the international community.
</P>
<P>
The people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait aspire for peaceful
development, the resolution says, adding that if the proposed law of
China violates the rights of the Taiwan people, it will incite
vehement opposition from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
It also says that the cross-strait atmosphere has improved in the
wake of the cross-strait charter flights during the Chinese New Year
holiday and that the governments on both sides should cherish the
opportunity to embark on consultation based on equality and dignity
to create a situation that is beneficial for both sides.
</P>
<P>
The political parties will also promote a China policy based on
equality and reciprocity and do their best to promote cross-strait
peaceful development, it says.
</P>
<P>
The legislative caucuses of the ruling and the opposition parties
said that this is a preliminary appeal and that they will respond
further if Beijing goes ahead to enact the law.

FEMALE DPP LAWMAKERS LAUNCH CYBER PROTEST AGAINST ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 4 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of female legislators from the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) launched a cyber lobby
movement Friday, appealing to the world to heed Taiwan's concerns and
oppose Beijing's imminent enactment of an anti-secession law
targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In an open letter initiating the lobby Web site --
www.mammycare.org.tw -- the DPP legislators, including Kuan Pi-ling,
Lan Mei-chin, Wang Shu-hui, Hsiao Bi-khim and Chang Ching-hui, urged
Taiwan citizens, particularly mothers, to relay the open letter to
influential organizations around the world to let the world know
their concerns and worries over Beijing's plans to pass the law.
</P>
<P>
The open letter, titled "Concerns of an Ordinary Mother, " says
that "China, one of our neighbors and a sister in whose veins runs
the same blood as us, claims sovereignty over Taiwan that nourishes
us, and demands our admission that Taiwan is a part of China despite
the fact that both sides have completely different systems, cultural
backgrounds and institutions. China forces us to accept the logic of
her thinking, and will not take 'no' for an answer."
</P>
<P>
"China is poised to enact the anti-secession law by the end of
March, to provide a legal basis for confining Taiwan, the country my
children and I live in, and unification with China without any
autonomous development. The only choice left for us would be war, "
the open letter says.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped, said Kuan, that the open letter will be forwarded,
with Taiwan mothers' signatures, to people in the European Union, the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the United Nations Security
Council, Japan, the United States and other countries to voice
Taiwan's opposition to the anti-secession legislation and to disclose
Beijing's attempts to annex Taiwan, moves that would eventually
undermine cross-strait and regional peace and stability.

LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER DEFENDS RIGHTS OF LEGISLATURE

<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 4 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Legislative Yuan has rights in terms of
cross-Taiwan Strait affairs as long as it acts within the law and
does not affect the rights of the president at the diplomatic and
administrative level, Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the remarks one day after a majority of legislators
reached consensus on the formation of a task force within the
legislature to handle cross-strait affairs, although lawmakers from
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) also cautioned that
matters related to cross-strait ties are the power of the president
according to the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The DPP and its ally the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) said
Friday that they are opposed to a re-activation of the cross-strait
task force and will not allow members of their parties to be a part
of it. The TSU also pointed out that the task force existed in the
previous legislature but claimed that it was ineffectual and a waste
of time.
</P>
<P>
Members of the task force will include the legislative speaker,
vice speaker and 23 legislators who will be selected in proportion to
the number of the seats each party holds in the legislature.
The members will be decided by March 20.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that if the DPP and the TSU refuse to nominate
delegates, it is their right and will not affect the operations of
the task force.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the responsibility of the president on
cross-strait ties is mainly centered on the diplomatic and
administrative level, while the Legislative Yuan is monitoring
cross-strait affairs and formulating related laws. The task force has
not encroached on the Executive rights, and its operations are
governed by the law, he said.

KMT CALLS FOR BEIJING NOT TO ENACT ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 4 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The legislative caucus of Taiwan's main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) called on Beijing Friday not to enact its
proposed "anti-secession law" as it is a unilateral move that dwarfs
Taiwan's status and harms cross-Taiwan Strait relations.
</P>
<P>
China should cease immediately the legislation of the
controversial bill, which threatens to alter the cross-strait status
quo and endanger the livelihoods of the people across the strait, "
said Chen Chieh, a KMT party whip at the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held at the Legislative Yuan, Chen Chieh
urged President Chen Shui-bian to continue to push for cross-strait
dialogue on peace, noting that KMT Chairman Lien Chan has expressed
his willingness to visit China in his capacity as KMT chief to help
accelerate peaceful engagement between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Underlining a quote by Lien -- "Radical independence means
radical unification, " Chen Chieh said the quote proved to be
prophetic, claiming that the president's previous statements about
pushing for a referendum on constitutional re-engineering were what
prompted Beijing to propose the anti-secession law.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chieh called for the president to respect the ROC
Constitution, to try to secure an environment in which the two sides
of the strait can co-exist peacefully, to resume the long-stalled
cross-strait dialogue and to seek developments that are beneficial to
both sides.
</P>
<P>
The KMT party whip also urged the Beijing leadership to respect
the will of the Taiwan people and to refrain from taking action
harmful to cross-strait peace and stability.

TAIPEI MAYOR URGES TAIWAN, CHINA TO STOP PROVOKING EACH OTHER

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou called on Taiwan
and China Friday to stop making provocative moves so as not to
intensify cross-Taiwan Strait tension.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a Tokyo gathering with a group of Taiwanese
expatriates in Japan, Ma said the government in Taiwan should drop
the ideological pursuit of changing the official name of the country
and drafting a new constitution, which he said will impede the
development of the island.
</P>
<P>
The government should instead concentrate on efforts to improve
the economy, law and order, and national development, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
He also said he believes last week's meeting between President
Chen Shui-bian and opposition People First Party Chairman James Soong
will be helpful to Taiwan's political stability.
</P>
<P>
Chen declared in the meeting that he has no plan to change the
country's name during his term and that his planned constitutional
reforms will not involve changes to national sovereignty, territory
or cross-strait status quo.
</P>
<P>
Ma said it is incomprehensible as to why Beijing decided to enact
an anti-secession law targeting Taiwan after the victory in last
year's legislative elections of the "pan-blue alliance" of the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT), People First Party and New Party, which
opposes independence for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that both sides of the strait stop such provocative
moves and enhance exchanges to build up mutual trust.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the mayor, who is also a vice chairman of the KMT,
said he will start campaigning for his bid to run for the party's
chairmanship after registering his candidacy in late March.
</P>
<P>
He said taking part in the chairmanship election is not
necessarily related to the question of whether he will run for the
2008 presidency.
</P>
<P>
Ma arrived in Japan earlier this week for a four-day visit. He is
scheduled to meet Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara and Yokohama Mayor
Hiroshi Nakada later in the day.

The 2005 Taipei International Cycle Show
opened Friday at the Taipei World Trade Center, with a new high of
620 companies from 29 countries taking part to show their advanced
items at a record 2,019 booths.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan External Trade Development Council Chairman Hsu Chih-jen
hailed Taiwan bike makers for their success in turning the domestic
industry into a value-added business through their innovation, making
Taiwan a world key supply hub for high-end bicycles.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei cycle show is the world's third-largest and the
largest in Asia. President Chen Shui-bian also attended the opening
of the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan Bicycle Exporters' Association Chairman Yang Yin-ming said
that under a labor division strategy between Taiwan and mainland
China, the domestic cycle industry will still be able to register
noticeable sales growth this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Yang, the domestic bike industry has come a long way
in building its own distinguished brand names over the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Although the domestic industry experienced the largest slump in
outbound shipments in 2003 as a result of company relocations to
mainland China and Vietnam, Yang said that it has got back to its
feet in recent years thanks to its exploration of new materials and
new designs.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan bike exports once peaked at a level of more than 10
million units during the heyday in the 1990s, he noted, adding that
the total export level of Taiwan, China and Vietnam reached 30
million units now.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Taiwan bike outbound shipments were about
4.38 million units in 2004, up by some 13 percent compared to the
2003 amount of 3.88 million units.
</P>
<P>
The 2004 export value totaled US$720 million, an increase of 23.7
percent over the 2003 level of US$580 million. Meanwhile, the average
unit price rose to US$164 in 2004 from the previous year's US$150.

<TEXT>
<P>
National Taiwan University (NTU) announced
Friday that it will set up a scholarship program to allow foreign
students from member countries of the University Mobility in Asia and
the Pacific (UMAP) to pursue advanced studies at domestic
universities.
</P>
<P>
Chou Chia-pei, director of the NTU International Academic
Exchange Center, made the announcement during a UMAP board meeting
attended by 20 representatives from 11 member countries.
</P>
<P>
The UMAP Taiwan Scholarship Program will be a three-year student
exchange plan effective between 2005 and 2008, during which 10
excellent students selected from the association's member countries
will be allowed to study at domestic universities every year, while
10 Taiwan students will be sent to those countries to study, Chou
said.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, each student will be offered a scholarship
worth NT$150,000 (US$4,840) annually, she went on.
</P>
<P>
Saying that the program has received support from the Ministry of
Education, Chou said NTU authorities will further discuss related
regulations over how to apply for the scholarships.
</P>
<P>
According to Chou, the scholarship program is expected to come
into force in mid-April.
</P>
<P>
UMAP, a voluntary association of government and non-government
representatives of the higher education (university) sector in the
Asia-Pacific region, was founded in 1993 with the aim of achieving
enhanced international understanding through mobility of university
students and staff.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the association has 19 member countries, including
Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Taiwan and the United States.
NTU President Chen Wei-jao serves as UMAP board chairman.

KMT WILL NOT ATTEND `PAN-GREEN' ANTI-ANNEXATION ACTIVITIES: KMT WHIP
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March  4 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Responding to an invitation from the
"pan-green camp" to an "anti-annexation" rally and demonstration
March 6, an opposition Kuomintang (KMT) whip said Friday that his
party will not take part.

</P>
<P>
Chen Jie told reporters at the KMT legislative caucus office that
the KMT opposes Beijing's move to enact an anti-secession law and
hopes that relations between the two sides across the Taiwan Strait
will maintain the status quo. However, he continued, the March 6
protests are being organized by the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party and its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, and the KMT "does
not want to dance with them."
</P>
<P>
Chen said that his party believes China's drafting of the
anti-secession law was a consequence of President Chen Shui-bian's
vows since assuming power in 2000 to hold a referendum on Taiwan
independence and the writing of a new constitution.
</P>
<P>
The moves have irritated Beijing, the lawmaker said. He noted
that the KMT wants the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to get along
with each other peacefully while trying to jointly boost economic
development on both sides.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-green camp" plans to hold a "protect Taiwan and oppose
annexation" rally in Taipei Sunday while staging a "306
anti-annexation" demonstration in Kaohsiung on the same day.
</P>
<P>
The National People's Congress -- China's rubber-stamp parliament
-- is expected to screen and approve the proposed anti-secession law
in mid-March.

The opposition People First Party (PFP)
will not send any officials to take part in a March 6 demonstration
against Beijing's anti-secession law organized by the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in Taipei, but will not prevent
its supporters from doing so, a party official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chih-pin, a PFP legislative caucus whip, made the remarks
after DPP caucus members invited officials of the main opposition
Kuomintang and the PFP to take part in the protest earlier the same
day. Premier Frank Hsieh and Secretary - General to the President Yu
Shyi-kun will participate in the activity.
</P>
<P>
Chen also ascribed Beijing's plan to enact the law, apparently
aimed at Taiwan, to what he described as President Chen Shui-bian's
"poor handling" of relations between Taiwan and China.
</P>

Chen and Soong released a 10-point joint statement late last

PRESIDENT VOWS TO CREATE WOMEN-FRIENDLY ENVIRONMENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Friday his
administration will do its utmost to create a women-friendly work and
living environment.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the pledge while visiting Chunghwa Telecom Co.'s Taipei
mobile phone call center to greet women workers there ahead of the
March 8 International Women's Day.
</P>
<P>
Chunghwa Telecom has hired a total of 500 women employees with
tertiary education to serve its 8 million-plus mobile phone
subscribers round the clock. The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA)
especially arranged for the president to visit the center ahead of
Women's Day to see for himself the work situation of local career
women.
</P>
<P>
About 90 employees were on duty when Chen arrived in the company
of CLA Chairwoman Chen Chu and Chunghwa Telecom Chairman Ho-Chen Tan
and the president presented a cut rose to each female staffer.
</P>
<P>
With the assistance of Chunghwa Telecom staff, Chen acted as a
call center staffer to answer two phone calls from Chunghwa mobile
phone subscribers, who were surprised when they heard the president's
voice. Chen told the subscribers that he is the real president, not a
fake. He also answered the subscribers' questions.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, Chen delivered a brief speech in which he said that
the government has enacted a workplace gender equality law to prevent
discrimination against women and a package of regulations to help
women land jobs.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he acknowledged that there is still ample room for
the government to improve welfare services for women, including
assistance in day care, child education, senior citizen care and
personal safety.
</P>
<P>
Noting that creating a women-friendly environment is the
government's unshirkable responsibility, Chen said neither career
women nor homemakers should be discriminated against because of their
gender.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the government will take steps to help women who have
quit the job market due to marriage or child-bearing to return to
work by offering vocational training programs catering to their
special professional needs.
</P>
<P>
During this era of focusing on cultivating a humanistic,
congenial working environment, Chen said, women can play a
constructive role in realizing that goal "with their tender hearts
and attentive work attitude."

TOKYO GOVERNOR REBUKES CHINA FOR PUSHING ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>

Tokyo,  March 4 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara rebuked
China Friday for planning to pass an anti-secession law that targets
Taiwan, calling Beijing a troublemaker that is making neighboring
countries nervous.
</P>
<P>
Ishihara made the remarks during a meeting with visiting Republic
of China Government Information Office (GIO) Director-General Lin
Chia-lung.
</P>
<P>
According to Ishihara, such a law is not a guarantee of
territorial integrity, because China will fall apart before it can
use the law against Taiwan if it cannot solve its many domestic
problems.
</P>
<P>
Ishihara said he had exchanged views with U.S. State Department
officials on the issue and that they share his views.
</P>
<P>
On the recent decision by the United States and Japan to list
peace in the Taiwan Strait part of their common strategic objectives
in the region, Ishihara pointed out that China has repeatedly sent
survey vessels and even submarines to areas near Japan's territorial
waters and Guam, which he said prompted Washington and Tokyo to
action.
</P>
<P>
Ishihara said China's military buildup and threat are not only
against Taiwan, but are also targeting the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Under these circumstances, it is necessary for the United States,
Japan and Taiwan to enhance their cooperation to jointly deal with
the problem, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lin went to Nagoya to visit Mayor Takehisa Matsubara after
concluding his meeting with Ishihara.
</P>
<P>
Lin, who arrived in Japan Tuesday for a five-day visit, also met
Yokohama Mayor Hiroshi Nakada and attended a Tokyo seminar on East
Asia security and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Lin has announced his decision to resign from his GIO post to
seek the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's nomination to run for
Taichung mayor in year-end elections.

LEGISLATURE WARNS BEIJING OVER ANTI-SECESSION BILL IN RESOLUTION

<P>
The various political parties in the
Legislative Yuan warned Beijing Friday of Taiwan's resentment over
China's proposed anti-secession bill and urged it to halt immediately
the legislation of the bill.
</P>
<P>
The legislature said it passed a resolution on behalf of the
Taiwan people on the anti-secession law that will soon be reviewed
and approved by the National People's Congress, Beijing's
rubber-stamp parliament.
</P>
<P>
The resolution says that since its founding in 1912, the Republic
of China has been a "sovereign, independent country" and that any
move that tries to unilaterally change the status quo or denigrate
the sovereignty of the nation will run counter to the common will of
the Taiwan people and the international community.
</P>
<P>
The people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait aspire to peaceful
development, the resolution says, adding that if China's proposed law
violates the rights of the Taiwan people, it will incite vehement
opposition from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
It also says that the cross-strait atmosphere has improved in the
wake of the cross-strait charter flights during the Chinese New Year
holiday and that the governments on both sides should cherish the
opportunity to embark on consultation based on equality and dignity
to create a situation that is beneficial for both sides.
</P>
<P>
The political parties will also promote a China policy based on
equality and reciprocity and do their best to promote cross-strait
peaceful development, it says.

A private group urged the
opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan Friday to pass a resolution
authorizing the holding of a referendum on the government's proposed
massive arms procurement package.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Action Alliance (DAA) , which groups scholars and
social activists, said the legislature should pass the resolution in
line with the existing Referendum Law to allow for the arms
procurement referendum to be held simultaneously with the elections

The Central Election Commission has set May 14 as the polling day

Under the arms procurement package, Taiwan plans to purchase
eight diesel-electric submarines, six PAC III Patriot anti-missile
batteries and a squadron of 12 P-3C Orion anti-submarine aircraft
from the United States.

Chang said such a huge arms procurement package should not be
decided just by a handful of politicians.

project's fate," Chang said.

ACADEMIC GROUP URGES PRESIDENT TO DELIVER ON NAME-CHANGE PROMISE

Taipei,  March  4 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Central Taiwan Society (CTS) , a
pro-independence group, called on President Chen Shui-bian Friday to
deliver on his promises to "rectify" or rather, change the country's
official name and to write a new constitution.
</P>
<P>
The group made the appeal in a statement issued in response to a
10-point agreement reached between Chen and opposition People First
Party Chairman James Soong during a Feb. 24 meeting.
</P>
<P>
Among the agreements was that the national status of the Republic
of China as stated in the Constitution defines the de facto and de
jure status quo across the Taiwan Strait and that this sovereignty
status of the ROC deserves recognition and respect by both sides of
the Taiwan Strait and the international community.
</P>
<P>
Chen also reaffirmed his long-standing commitment that during his
term, he will not declare independence for Taiwan, will not change
the official name of the country, will not include the
"state-to-state" theory in the Constitution, will not promote a
referendum to change the cross-strait status quo and will not abolish
the Guidelines for National Unification and the National Unification
Council.
</P>
<P>
The CTS claimed that the Chen-Soong meeting has "strongly
impacted" the people of Taiwan who are working to build their
country, while the 10-point agreement has brought Taiwan back to the
former Kuomintang government's ideology.
</P>
<P>
The group said in its statement that efforts made by the
president to seek inter-party reconciliation should be recognized,
but that he should not lose his own stance for reconciliation's sake.
</P>
<P>
Since the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) came to power in
2000, Chen has constantly shown goodwill gesture towards both China
and pro-unification activists, the statement says, adding that the
people of Taiwan have refrained from expressing their disappointment
with the president's "coddling" toward his political rivals because
they feel that this is just a transitional expediency adopted by the
president.
</P>
<P>
But after the Chen-Soong meeting, CTS said they thinks the
president has fallen short of the expectations of the people of
Taiwan, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement also says that Chen should stop before committing a
serious blunder and refrain from playing political games.

<P>
Since the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party passed a resolution regarding Taiwan's future in 1999 when it
was still an opposition party, there has been a consensus among party
members that the Republic of China is already an independent and
sovereign state and that it is not necessary to declare independence
from any country, Premier Frank Hsieh said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the comment while answering questions during a
legislative interpellation session. He also said that the conclusion
of a meeting between President Chen Shui-bian and opposition People
First Party Chairman James Soong does not contravene the 1999
resolution. On the contrary, it met the resolution's spirit, he
claimed.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, proposed by Chen in 1999, states that Taiwan is a
sovereign and independent country and that any change in the status
quo must be decided by all the residents of Taiwan by means of a
plebiscite.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh noted that both Chen and Soong have agreed that any change
in Taiwan's status quo has to be decided by the people of Taiwan.

Former President of the Control Yuan
Fredrick Chien, who served as the minister of foreign affairs between
1990 and 1996, said Friday that better ties with China would be
helpful for Taiwan's diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
In a news conference to introduce the first two volumes of his
memoirs, Chien said, contrary to public opinion, better ties with
China would help Taiwan to associate with other countries.
</P>
<P>
Public opinion holds that ties with China would actually make it
more difficult for Taiwan to engage with other countries.
</P>
<P>
Chien, who joined the diplomatic service in 1962 and was involved
in the shaping of the country's diplomatic policy for many years,
said the country's top diplomatic priority of joining the World
Health Organization and the United Nations would not be easier if
Taiwan maintained better ties with China.
</P>
<P>
Chien said he would explain his points in the third volume of his
memoirs, which is not yet finished.
</P>
<P>
Chien is the only foreign minister who has claimed while
taking the reins at the foreign minstry that diplomacy should be
dictated by the country's policy toward China.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has tried to join the United Nations since 1993 and to
enter the World Health Organization since 1997, only to see its
repeated bids defeated by China, which has gone out of its way to
shut Taiwan out of the international community.

ANTI-SECESSION LAW WILL AUTHORIZE BEIJING TO USE FORCE: MAC OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 4 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A legislator of the pro-Taiwan independence
Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) quoted Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Huang Wei-feng as saying Friday that
China's proposed anti-secession law would authorize Beijing to use
force against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Ho Min-hao, deputy convener of the TSU legislative caucus, said
Huang made the remarks while delivering a report on Beijing's plan to
enact an anti-secession law targeting Taiwan at a closed-door meeting
with TSU lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
Beijing officials have disclosed that China will use non-peaceful
means against Taiwan if necessary, Huang was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Judging from the statement, the anti-secession law will be an
act authorizing the Beijing authorities to wage war on Taiwan, " said
Huang.
</P>
<P>
As for the government's countermeasures to the proposed
legislation, Ho said that the government should join hands with
friendly countries to protect the rights and interests of the people
of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
While continuing to push for the establishment of a peaceful and
stable cross-Taiwan Strait interaction framework, the government
should intensify its international publicity campaign to let the
international community understand that Taiwan is a sovereign
independent country and that neither side of the Taiwan Strait has
jurisdiction over the other, said Ho.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, the government should also call on the
international community to help cope with Beijing's intention to use
force against the island by enacting its so-called anti-secession
law.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ho disclosed that the MAC, the top agency in charge of
drafting Taiwan's China policy, will do its utmost to deter China
from sabotaging peace and stability across the strait.

</P>
<P>
Once the National People's Congress -- China's rubber-stamp
parliament -- approves the law in a plenary session slated to be held
March 8-14, the MAC will make an appropriate response, Ho went on.
</P>
<P>
He further said that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent
five delegations to the United States, Europe and Japan to meet with
government officials, parliamentarians, think tank experts and local
media in those countries to brief them on Taiwan's basic stance, in
the hope that they will help block the anti-secession law from going
into force.

PATROL RAFT COLLIDES WITH CHINSE SAMPAN NEAR KINMEN, TWO KILLED
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 5 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A patrol raft of the Kinmen Coast Guard
collided Friday night with a sampan from Fujian, southern China, off
the coast of the outlying county of Kinmen, killing two Chinese
fishermen aboard the sampan, according to the Coast Guard Office on
Kinmen.
</P>
<P>
The patrol raft lost power and ran aground after the collision
and the crew were picked up by anther patrol raft after the accident,
said the Kinmen Coast Guard Office.
</P>
<P>
The accident took place when Kinmen Coast Guard radar spotted a
Chinese sampan suspected of carrying smuggled goods sailing toward
Chinyu on Kinmen.
</P>
<P>
Two patrol rafts were sent to intercept the sampan and at about
10 p.m., the sampan, finding it was being trailed by the patrol
rafts, tried to jettison its contraband and escape at speed.
</P>
<P>
The two patrol rafts approached the sampan to stop it, but one of
them collided with the sampan head-on in the dark when the sampan
made a sudden turn in an attempt to escape.
</P>
<P>
Two of the four crew aboard the sampan fell into the sea during
the collision and were rescued by a Chinese fishing boat operating
nearby.
</P>
<P>
After the accident, the Kinmen Coast Guard Office sent another
three patrol boats to the scene to search for the other two crewmen,
only to find their bodies still on the sampan.
</P>
<P>
After checking with their counterparts in the Chinese port of
Xiamen, the Kinmen Coast Guard Office said the sampan came from
Dadeng, Xiamen City. The dead were named as skipper Chang Fucheng and
crew member Zhang Zongrong.
</P>
<P>
After the accident, a dozen Chinese fishing boats surrounded the
abandoned patrol raft and the sampan until six Chinese patrol boats
arrived on the scene Saturday morning to investigate, according to
the Kinmen Coast Guard Office.

DPP, PFP DENY REPORT ON COOPERATION IN YEAR-END ELECTIONS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 5 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
and opposition People First Party (PFP) politicians denied Saturday a
report in a local daily suggesting that the two parties are planning
to cooperate in the year-end mayoral and magistrate elections.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the report, DPP legislative caucus leader Lai
Ching-teh said he had not heard of any such proposal being discussed
by the party leadership.
</P>
<P>
Lai pointed out that such cooperation would have to involve many
practical difficulties because it would lessen the chances of DPP
politicians who wish to take part in the elections and would damage
the DPP's cooperation with its ally, the opposition Taiwan Solidarity
Union.
</P>
<P>
DPP support for a PFP candidate in the elections would likely
also turn "pan-blue alliance" voters away, which would benefit the
KMT, Lai pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Agreeing with Lai, PFP Legislator Liu Wen-hsiung, who is planning
to run for Keelung mayor, said it would be unlikely that the PFP and
DPP will cooperate in the elections in light of the obvious
ideological differences between the two parties.
</P>
<P>
Lu Hsueh-chang, another PFP legislator, said the "pan-blue
alliance" of the KMT and PFP would have little chance of winning if
the alliance should fall apart.
</P>
<P>
Liao Feng-teh, head of the KMT's Organization and Development
Committee, said his party will continue to monitor the situation to
see if there is any substance to the report.
</P>
<P>
Another KMT official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
pointed out that the KMT is prepared to recommend joint candidates
with the PFP in the year-end elections and has revised related rules
to facilitate such cooperation.
</P>
<P>
However, if the PFP wishes to cooperate with the DPP, the KMT
will not object to it, either, the official said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the possibility of the DPP and PFP
cooperating in the elections rose after last week's meeting between
President Chen Shui-bian and PFP Chairman James Soong.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper claimed that the two parties had reached a high
degree of consensus on cooperation in Hsinchu County and might expand
their partnership to Hsinchu City, Miaoli County and Keelung City.
All these localities are currently controlled by the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT), a long-time "pan-blue" ally of the PFP.
</P>
<P>
In one scenario speculated upon, the PFP might support the DPP's
candidate in Hsinchu County in exchange for the DPP's support for its
candidate in Miaoli County.

NO NEED TO FEAR BEIJING'S ANTI-SECESSION LAW: DPP LAWMAKER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 5 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan does not need to fear or overreact
to Beijing's proposed enactment of an anti-secession law, ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Lin Cho-shui said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that Beijing does not need to make a law to attack
Taiwan and crush its independence movement, Lin told the Central News
Agency in an interview that it is simply disapproval from the
international community rather than any lack of a legal basis that
has prevented Beijing from doing so. 
</P>
<P>
Lin said that Beijing's planned legislation of the anti-secession
law reflects its discontent with Washington's Taiwan Relations Act
(TRA) and that Beijing intends to use it to counter what it sees as
U.S. meddling in Taiwan affairs, which Beijing views as an internal
issue.
</P>
<P>
However, Lin pointed out that Beijing's anti-secession law
differs hugely to the TRA, given that the U.S. law only governs
two-way ties and does not infringe upon Taiwan's sovereignty or
intervene in its policy making.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, Beijing's anti-secession law is drafted with the
aim of seeking to arbitrate Taiwan's policy making and dictate Taiwan
affairs as a domestic issue of China, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
But he asserted that Beijing will have no say over Taiwan's
rejection of its law, as Taiwan is not a part of China.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he went on, there is no need for Taiwan to fear or
overreact to it, since international objections to Beijing's use of
force against Taiwan will not disappear just because of a new piece
of legislation. He urged the Taiwan people to strongly air their
opposition to Beijing's scheme to alter the status quo across the
Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Lin's remarks came at a time when Beijing is expected to enact
the law later this month, despite olive branches held out by the
Taiwan authorities.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian and opposition People First Party
Chairman James Soong released a 10-point joint statement Feb. 24,
pledging not to declare Taiwan independence and to secure
cross-strait peace.

12 TAIWAN IT PRODUCTS ENJOY NO. 1 SHARES IN WORLD MARKET: III
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 5 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twelve information technology (IT) goods
made by Taiwan companies enjoyed the largest or second-largest shares
in the world market last year, the semi-official Institute for
Information Industry (III) reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Market Intelligence Center (MIC) at the III, 12
IT products manufactured by Taiwan companies boasted either the No. 1
or No. 2 market shares around the world.
</P>
<P>
Routers posted the largest stake of 89.2 percent in the global
market, followed by WLAN products with 80.3 percent, motherboards and
notebook computers with 78.3 percent, and DSLCPE with 70.9 percent,
MIC statistics show. Other products enjoying the world's leading
market shares included LCD monitors with 67.6 percent, cable modems
with 66.3 percent and switches with 59 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the largest market share is not equal to a guarantee of
handsome earnings, MIC tallies pointed out, indicating that notebook
computers, motherboards and LCD monitors contributed a combined 77
percent of the IT industry's overall output value last year -- some
US$51.9 billion out of US$67.3 billion generated both at home and
abroad.
</P>
<P>
The domestic industry is expected to put out more than US$70
billion in value for 2005. The figure stood at US$54.4 billion last
year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, statistics compiled by the Cabinet-level Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) show that Taiwan
computer firms at home and abroad yielded a total of US$62.7 billion
in production value in 2004, up by 21.5 percent over the previous
year's level.
</P>
<P>
Notebook computers and LCD monitors made up the lion's share of
63 percent of the industry's total revenue last year, or a combined
production value of US$39.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
Some 85.1 percent of the total was put out last year in China, an
increase of 21.8 percentage points year on year, according to the
DGBAS tallies. As high as 91.7 percent of Taiwan companies' main
hardware products are manufactured overseas out of their quest for
cheaper costs.

VICE PRESIDENT PROPOSES 'TWO CHINAS' TO COUNTER BEIJING'S 'ONE CHINA'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 5 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice President Annette Lu proposed Saturday
that the government declare to the world the existence of "two
Chinas" to counter Beijing's "one China" policy.
</P>
<P>
Lu put forth the idea during an interview with a local media
organization in the wake of President Chen Shui-bian's recent
statements that he has no plans to change the official name of the
country from the Republic of China to "Republic of Taiwan" during his
term.
</P>
<P>
Lu pointed out that while there is a communist People's Republic
of China, there is also a free and democratic Republic of China on
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Under this "two Chinas" framework, the anti-secession law that
Beijing is planning to enact will be inapplicable to Taiwan, because
the law will only be effective in territory controlled by the PRC, Lu
argued.
</P>
<P>
According to Lu, Beijing compelled Taipei to accept the "one
China" policy during talks held in Hong Kong in 1992, and both sides
later came to a compromise that allowed either side to express in
oral form their respective interpretations of the meaning of "one
China, " with Beijing insisting that "one China" refers to the PRC
and Taipei insisting that "one China" refers to the ROC.
</P>
<P>
This so-called "1992 consensus" established during the time of
the former Kuomintang (KMT) government reflected the fact that there
are "two Chinas," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Lu suggested that the opposition KMT, as a supporter of the "1992
consensus, " openly confess it is following a policy of "two Chinas"
and take the lead in promoting the idea of "two Chinas."
</P>
<P>
She agreed with Chen that the ROC is the largest area of common
ground between the different political camps in Taiwan on the
controversial issue of national identity.
</P>
<P>
In response to the vice president's proposal, KMT spokesman Chang
Jung-kung said that although the concept of "two Chinas" is closest
to the reality, it cannot solve the problems across the Taiwan
Strait.
</P>
<P>
Chang said the KMT believes the government should allow a certain
extent of ambiguity in dealing with cross-strait issues, because
anything else will only lead to confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the pro-independence opposition Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU) criticized the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
for "deceiving itself and the people of Taiwan" by putting forth the
idea of "two Chinas."
</P>
<P>
According to TSU legislative caucus convener Lo Chih-ming, the
idea will be accepted by neither Beijing nor the international
community.
</P>
<P>
Lo claimed that the ROC vanished from the world after its United
Nations membership was replaced by the PRC in 1971, noting that
nobody recognizes the existence of the ROC today with the exception
of a group of fewer than 30 diplomatic allies bought by Taiwan
through checkbook diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
Lo insisted that the cross-strait status quo is "one China, one
Taiwan" or "one country on either side" and that the destiny of
Taiwan should be decided by its people.

REPORT REFLECTS BEIJING'S REFUSAL TO RENOUNCE USE OF FORCE: MAC
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 5 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao's latest policy
report unmistakably reflects Beijing's unwillingness to renounce the
option of using force against Taiwan, the Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The MAC, the nation's top mainland China policy planning agency,
made the comments in a press release issued after Wen said in his
annual administrative report to the National People's Congress --
China's rubber-stamp parliament -- earlier in the day that China will
beef up its military strength to ensure eventual unification of the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
According to information published by the Beijing authorities,
the MAC press statement said, China's defense budget for 2005 will
increase 12.6 percent from the year-earlier level to reach US$30
billion. The amount does not include many other stealth defense
funds.
</P>
<P>
The MAC statement pointed out that China's largely increased
defense budget will mainly be used to expand its military deployment
against Taiwan and upgrade its international influence.
</P>
<P>
"This trend will become even more concrete and conspicuous after
its so-called anti-secession law is enacted," the MAC statement said,
adding that such a development will have a grave adverse impact on
regional security and stability.
</P>
<P>
While Wen claimed that the Chinese government will work
"sincerely and energetically to bring about peaceful unification of
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, " the MAC statement said,
Beijing's proposed anti-secession law definitely runs against Wen's
claimed goal.
</P>
<P>
Cross-strait relations and regional peace and stability will
certainly be at stake if Beijing insists on going ahead with its
anti-secession legislation, the MAC statement said.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's parliament is expected to screen and approve the
so-called anti-secession law targeting Taiwan during its current
plenary session.

<P>
Opposition Kuomintang lawmaker and former
chief of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Su Chi said Saturday that
the four points spelled out by Chinese President Hu Jintao the
previous day are nothing but a reiteration of China's long-standing
stick-and-carrot approach toward dealing with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with CNA, Su said Hu's statement is similar to

pro-independence Taiwanese from the rest of the population and treats
them differently.

The main points of Hu's remarks are that his administration will
stick to its "one China" policy, will not give up the aim of using
peaceful means to "reunite" with Taiwan until the last and will
never accept a Taiwan permanently independent from China.
</P>
<P>
Su said the anti-secession law contemplated by Beijing is
intended to send a red light warning for Taiwan instead of keeping
flashing a yellow light.
</P>
<P>
With the red light, Su said, Beijing wants to make its bottom
line known to Taiwan rather than let some people on the island keep
pushing the envelope without knowing what will be the last straw.
</P>
<P>
Of course Taiwan should speak out against Beijing's
anti-secession law, but it should be careful not to spoil the
more relaxed atmosphere with China following the charter
flights during the Chinese New Year holidays, Su said, suggesting
that President Chen Shui-bian refrain from commenting on Beijing's
move and to let the MAC to do it instead.

STUDENTS STAGE SIT-IN TO PROTEST AGAINST ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 5 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A small group of university students staged
a sit-in Saturday at the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall complex in
Taipei to protest against Beijing's move to enact a so-called
anti-secession law. 
</P>
<P>
Before starting their sit-in, the students, numbering only around
10 and from schools including National Taiwan University, National
Chengchi University and National Changhua University of Education,
displayed a big white banner bearing Chinese characters reading
"protest against China's enactment of the anti-secession law" and
read out a protest statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement expressed opposition to communist China's move to
enact an anti-secession law, and a petition for Beijing to respect
Taiwan's right to freedom. It also declared that the future of the
Republic of China should be decided by the people of the country and
that no country can assault Taiwan's sovereignty and democratic
values.
</P>
<P>
The statement urged local politicians to stop being aggressive
toward others with different political ideas and asked them to seek
unity in the face of China's attempts to annex Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement also urged the parliaments and people of
other countries around the world to condemn Beijing and to help
maintain peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
After releasing the statement, two students with white headbands
sat down to launch the 24-hour sit-in in relays. Every two hours, a
two-strong team would take over the baton of the protest movement.
</P>
<P>
Kao Ming-lin, a National Taiwan University student in entomology
who was acting as spokesman for the protesters, said they hope more
students and members of the public will join in the protest.
</P>
<P>
The controversial law, which is expected to be screened and
enacted in mid-March, provides a legal basis for China to use force
against Taiwan should the island declare independence.

RULING PARTY URGED TO STICK TO ITS CROSS-STRAIT POLICY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 5 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) should stick firm to its policy in terms of Taiwan's ties with
China to avoid public confusion, opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Legislator Su Chi said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Su's comments came after Vice President Annette Lu said earlier
in the day that the Taiwan authorities should apply a "two Chinas"
policy to deal with the delicate situation across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
As President Chen Shui-bian has recently said in public that he
will not change Taiwan's official designation during his term in
office, Lu suggested in an interview that the "two Chinas" concept --
a reference to the free Republic of China in Taiwan and the communist
People's Republic of China in China -- be used to tackle relations
between the two sides of the strait.
</P>
<P>
She also urged the main opposition KMT to echo her proposal.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the KMT is always supportive of the "one China,
respective interpretations" principle and has never deviated from
that idea, Su said that this is the key point that distinguishes the
KMT from the pro-Taiwan independence DPP.
</P>
<P>
He urged Chen to respond with a clear explanation of Lu's remarks
so as not to further confuse the Taiwan people.
</P>
<P>
Su once served as chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council, Taiwan's top China policy planning agency, in the previous
KMT-led government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, KMT spokesman Chang Jong-kung said that Lu's "two
Chinas" proposal is not helpful in easing cross-strait tension and he
suggested that the DPP government refrain from confronting China and
maintain an ambiguous position in Taiwan-China dealings.
</P>
<P>
Cross-strait relations have been sensitive in recent days prior
to an anticipated enactment of an anti-secession law in the middle of
this month by Beijing's National People's Congress -- a move widely
believed to be designed to provide a legal basis for China to attack
Taiwan should the country continue moving toward independence.

ANTI-SECESSION LAW TO MARK WATERSHED IN CROSS-STRAIT TIES: VP
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March  5  (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice President Annette Lu predicted
Saturday that the passage of an anti-secession law by China will mark
a watershed in cross-Taiwan Strait relations.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with a local media organization, Lu speculated
that Beijing will shift to a proactive approach in dealing with
relations with Taiwan after the enactment of the law.
</P>
<P>
Although China has not made public the content of the
legislation, intelligence shows that Beijing will stick to the
principles of "one China, " "peaceful unification," "one country, two
systems" and "no toleration of Taiwan independence" in the law,
according to Lu.
</P>
<P>
She said China has made the Taiwan question an international
issue and is imposing its "one China" policy in the international
community.
</P>
<P>
She also urged the public to take part in "anti-annexation"
demonstrations organized by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
and the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union Sunday in Taipei and
Kaohsiung, respectively, to express their objection to the
anti-secession law.
</P>
<P>
However, Lu said she and President Chen Shui-bian will not
participate in the activities, because it would not be appropriate
for the head of state to make such an eye-catching move.

A two-day training camp to foster
democratic spirit among young people and train them to advocate
democracy in modern society, the first of its kind in Taiwan, opened
in the southern port city of Kaohsiung Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The event, organized by the National Youth Commission (NYC), was
held at the Bureau of Human Resource Development for Civil Servants
and Teachers under the Kaohsiung city government, with around 60
young people participating.
</P>
<P>
NYC Chairwoman Cheng Li-chun and Acting Kaohsiung Mayor Chen
Chi-mai were on hand to deliver opening speeches.
</P>
<P>
The training camp can serve as a continuation of last year's
National Youth Conference, Cheng said, adding that disagreements are
normal in a democracy, while respecting individual differences is one
of the true democratic principles.
</P>
<P>
Chen encouraged the participants to advocate the democratic
essence in their communities after finishing the training so that the
public can exercise their right to join in formulating public
policies.
</P>
<P>
The commission intends to foster in the young participants the
abilities to organize and facilitate public discussion forums on
democracy and will select some of them to act as hosts of this year's
National Youth Conference, Cheng added.

FOREIGN INVESTORS TAKE SIDELINES PRIOR TO BEIJING ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  5 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Foreign investors have taken to the
sidelines in the Taiwan Stock Exchange out of concern over possible
negative impact on the domestic bourse of an anticipated
anti-secession law by Beijing against Taiwan, market analysts said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors are reserved about buying Taiwan shares due to
Beijing's move to enact the law, evidence in that market turnovers in
recent days were markedly lower than usual, market watchers said.
</P>
<P>
The weighted index, the key gauge for the domestic stock market,
finished 8.76 points lower Friday at 6,193.62 points on a market
turnover of NT$81.29 billion (US$2.62 billion) . The market closed at
6,202.38 points Thursday on a market turnover of NT$78.43 billion,
down by 22.87 points from Wednesday's finish.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts, however, were positive about the mid-term and
long-term prospects for the domestic bourse if Beijing does not come
up with provocative content in the anti-secession law, which is
expected to be passed in the middle of this month.
</P>
<P>
The market will be provided with new leads should the law fail to
clear Beijing's parliament or contain only lax rules, they contended,
adding that the falls in the Taiwan Stock Exchange over the past few
days only represent a temporary break amid a continued inflow of
foreign capital.

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian accepted on behalf
of the government Saturday a collection of the late Vice President
Chen Cheng's personal effects and documents donated by his family.
</P>
<P>
Chen Li-an, Chen's son who once served as Control Yuan president,
handed over the large collection of historical documents, photos and
artifacts to President Chen in a ceremony held at Academia Historica.
</P>
<P>
The donation ceremony coincided with the 40th anniversary of the
late vice president's death March 5, 1965.
</P>
<P>
It was the first batch of historical documents handed over to
Academia Sinica since the presidential and vice presidential archives
management statute was enacted in January 2004.
</P>
<P>
The collection includes more than 5,600 historical documents,
more than 17,000 photos and more than 1,100 of the late vice
president's personal effects.
</P>
<P>
Chen Cheng joined the military in China and took part in many
important battles in the Republic of China's history, including the
fight against warlords, the War of Resistance against Japan and the
campaign against Mao Zedong's Chinese communist army.
</P>
<P>
After the Kuomintang-led government moved its seat to Taiwan from
China, Chen Cheng contributed greatly to re-organizing the ROC troops
and subsequent land reforms.

ROC TIES WITH DIPLOMATIC ALLIES REMAIN STEADFAST: MOFA

<P>
Relations between the Republic of China and
its three Central American allies -- Guatemala, El Salvador and
Honduras -- have remained steadfast, Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) spokesman Michel Lu said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Lu was responding to media reports that Wang Zhen, deputy
director of the international affairs office of China's Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, is heading a delegation on visits to the three ROC
allies in an effort to lure them into switching diplomatic allegiance
from Taipei to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the ROC embassies in the three Central American countries
have been closely monitoring the mainland delegation's activities.
The governments of the three countries have assured the ROC embassies
that their diplomatic relations with the ROC have remained unchanged
and steadfast.
</P>
<P>
In the face of Beijing's constant diplomatic offensive against
Taiwan, Lu said the government has spared no efforts to cement ties
with the country's diplomatic allies. Lu said he hopes local people
will not worry about the nation's diplomatic prospects.
</P>
<P>
Ko Chi-sheng, director of the MOFA's Central and South American
Affairs Department, said the mainland delegation's visits to the
three Central American will not affect Vice President Annette Lu's
upcoming visit to the region.
</P>
<P>
With its economic strength growing in recent years, Ko said,
China has often organized the so-called trade missions to visit the
ROC's diplomatic allies and take advantage of such trips to lobby
them to switch diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing.
However, Ko said, mainland China's such efforts have so far not
succeeded.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Lu is scheduled to leave Taipei March 12 at the
head of a delegation of industry and business executives to visit
Guatemala and El Salvador to survey investment opportunities and
promote bilateral exchanges and cooperation.

<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh will deliver an
important policy speech at an anti-annexation rally Sunday to clearly
explain the government's stance on Beijing's proposed anti-secession
legislation targeting Taiwan, political sources said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The rally will be organized by the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) at Chengyuan Senior High School in Taipei to express
Taiwan's opposition against China's soon-to-be-passed anti-secession
law.
</P>
<P>
During the rally, DPP sources said, Hsieh will reiterate the
government's strong opposition to China's legislative plan and will
also for the first time offer a comprehensive report on the
government's thinking, attitude and response measures toward the
so-called anti-secession law.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, the sources said, Hsieh will remind local people
to pay heed to China's concrete action instead of its lip service.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Office Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun, DPP Chairman
Su Tseng-chang and representatives of major local pro-independence
private groups will attend the rally.
</P>
<P>
DPP Chairman Su will also speak on the occasion with a softer
tone than Hsieh's, urging Beijing leaders to respect Taiwan people's
rights to determine their own future and let the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait co-exist peacefully, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, the DPP's traditional
ally, will sponsor an "anti-annexation, protect Taiwan" march in the
southern Taiwan port city of Kaoshiung Sunday to express Taiwan
people's determination to pursue peace while opposing Beijing's
attempt to annex the island.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Japan is worrying about China's planned
enactment of a so-called anti-secession law targeting Taiwan,
Government Information Office (GIO) Director-General Lin chia-lung
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Lin made the remarks after his return from a five-day visit to
Japan.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Lin attended an international seminar on the
new U.S.-Japan security agreement, Beijing's anti-secession
legislation and regional security issues.
</P>
<P>
Lin said many of the Japanese politicians, scholars, experts and
journalists he met during the visit had expressed serious concern
about Beijing's anti-secession legislation.
</P>
<P>
"They worry that such a law could destabilize the Taiwan Strait
situation, " Lin said, adding that he hopes the Japanese government
can dissuade Beijing from enacting such a detrimental law.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Lin, who has announced his decision to quit his
current post to seek the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's
nomination to run in the year-end mayoral election in the central
city of Taichung, said he also met with Tokyo Governor Shintaro
Ishihar and mayors of two large Japanese cities -- Yokohama and
Nagoya to learn from their experience in municipal administration.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou also concluded a visit to
Japan and returned to Taipei Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ma said he invited Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara and Yokohama
Mayor Hiroshi Nakada to attend a "healthy city" forum to be held in
Taipei late this year. Nakada has agreed to attend the forum while
Ishihara has yet to make a final decision, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
Ma added that he has learned much from the just-concluded visit.
"The experience will be conducive to boosting Taipei's urban
development and municipal administration," he explained.

CROSS-STRAIT ENGAGEMENT AS "CONTEST OF BRAVERY" DANGEROUS: MAYOR

<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou urged both sides
of the Taiwan Strait Sunday to make reciprocal concessions in dealing
with China's proposed anti-secession law, saying that engaging in a
cross-Taiwan Strait "contest of bravery" in handling the matter is
very dangerous.
</P>
<P>
The mayor made the remarks at a refugee house donation ceremony
held at a campsite in suburban Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that China's preparations to enact the law will not only
harm the cross-strait status quo but will also escalate tension in
the strait.
</P>
<P>
A statement made by Chinese President Hu Jin-tao Friday, which
came after President Chen Shui-bian and opposition People First Party
Chairman James Soong recently reached an agreement on various issues,
including constitutional reform and future cross-strait relations,
eased cross-strait tensions, Ma claimed, adding that even if Beijing
insists on enacting the anti-secession law, it should not excessively
irritate those who support Taiwan independence.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Hu refereed to some positive factors in
cross-strait relations and the Chen-Soong agreement is believed to be
one of the positive factors.
</P>
<P>
Saying that the basic rule in maintaining peace between the two
sides of the strait is that "China does not use force and Taiwan does
not declare independence, " the mayor noted that if neither side can
respect this rule, cross-strait relations will be jeopardized.

DPP TO FOLLOW CANADA IN PROMOTING DEMOCRACY IN AFRICA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Ottawa,   March  5  (CNA)
(By S.K. Wu and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A member of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) claimed Saturday that her party will follow
Canada to help push for democracy in Africa and share Taiwan's
democratic experience with other countries.
</P>
<P>
Chou Ching-yu, a member of the DPP's Standing Committee, made the
comments while speaking at a workshop presided over by Raymonde
Folco, vice president of Liberal International, held during the
Biennial Convention of the Liberal Party of Canada.
</P>
<P>
Saying that the DPP has a permanent human rights representative
at London-based Liberal International, Chou expressed the hope that the
DPP can follow Canada in promoting democracy in Africa.
</P>
<P>
She also said that her party can learn a lot from the Liberal
Party of Canada, which has had years of experience in governing the
country.
</P>
<P>
A group of farsighted people formed the DPP 18 years ago when
Taiwan was still under the rule of martial law, Chou said, adding
that the island has gradually moved toward democratization and
freedom after the lifting of martial law and introducing a direct
presidential suffrage system. "We would like to share these
experience with other countries, " she said.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that China's hostility and Taiwan's lack of
membership in the World Health Organization and the United Nations
have done Taiwan a lot of harm, Chou said that the island needs
everyone's support.
</P>
<P>
During the convention, Chou, accompanied by H.H. Hsieh, deputy
director of the DPP's department of international affairs, also met
with Canadian Defense Minister William Graham, Canadian Leader of the
Government in the House of Commons Tony Valeri, Minister of Public
Works Scott Brison and Don Boudria, chairman of the Canada-Taiwan
Congressional Friendly Association, and exchanged views on various

5.9-MAGNITUDE JOLTS WAKE TAIWAN, NO MAJOR DAMAGE REPORTED
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two magnitude 5.9 earthquakes struck at
around 3 a.m. Sunday in Ilan County, eastern Taiwan, waking people in
eastern and northern Taiwan, the Central Weather Bureau (CWB)
reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the CWB Seismology Center, the two 5.9-magnitude
quakes rattled Ilan in two consecutive minutes beginning at 3:06
a.m., with the epicenter of both jolts located 6.4 km
northeast of Ilan at a depth of 8.5 km beneath the surface of
the sea, CWB seismologists said.
</P>
<P>
Because the quakes occurred in a relatively shallow area, it was
felt in almost every area from eastern Taiwan to northern and central
parts of the island.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 aftershocks, including several of magnitude 5.0,
were recorded afterwards, the seismologists said.
</P>
<P>
As of noon Sunday, no major damage or injury had been reported,
although walls in two hospitals in Ilan were reported to have cracked
and rocks fell along some sections of the Central Cross-Island
Highway, the weather bureau reported.
</P>
<P>
"We can expect to see aftershocks with a magnitude of around 5.0
on the Richter scale over the next two weeks or one month, " said Kuo
Kai-wen, director of the CWB Seismology Center.
</P>
<P>
According to Kuo, as the geological structure around Ilan is
uniquely complicated, earthquakes in those areas could be results of
both squeezing and rupturing actions when the Pacific Plate and the
Eurasian Plate collide, and when another deep-sea fault is broken.
</P>
<P>
The quakes had an intensity of 5.0 in Ilan City, 4.0 in the
eastern county of Hualien and the northern county of Taipei, 3.0 in
Taipei City, Taoyuan County, Keelung City and Hualien City, and 2.0
in Miaoli, Nantou, Changhua and Toulio in central Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The administration of the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park
-- the prime mover of Taiwan's high-technology industries -- reported
Sunday that the earthquakes, which had an intensity of 3.0 in
Hsinchu, did not disrupt the power system and that no damage was
caused at the science park.

TAUP CALLS FOR PROTECTION OF TAIWAN'S STATUS IN WTO
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  6 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Taiwan Association of University
Professors (TAUP) called on the government Sunday to take concrete
measures to prevent Taiwan's designation and status in the World
Trade Organization (WTO) from being degraded.
</P>
<P>
TAUP Chairman Tai Pao-tsung told a news conference that the WTO
Secretariat is planning to issue a new correspondence directory in
mid-March and that Taiwan's designation and sovereignty implications
will probably be changed by WTO Director-General Supachai
Panitchapkdi in the directory.
</P>
<P>
Even the current embassy-equivalent status of Taiwan's mission in
world trade regulatory body could also be degraded due to China's
strong pressure on Supachai and the Taiwan government's inadequate
response to the issue, Tai said.
</P>
<P>
Tai urged the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other related
government agencies to study and adopt concrete countermeasures to
protect the nation's rights and interests in the WTO.
</P>
<P>
"If Foreign Affairs Minister Tan Sun Chen compromises with
Supachai on his action to alter the designation of the country's
mission to the WTO, Taiwan will be deprived of its status implying
national sovereignty and the Democratic Progressive Party government
will thus become a traitor," Tai claimed.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Huang Chao-tang, chairman of the
Taiwan Independence Union and a TAUP member, said that the government
should make it clear to the world that Taiwan is an independent
country with national sovereignty and do its utmost to safeguard the
country's WTO interests and rights.
</P>
<P>
According to Taiwan's WTO admission terms, its representative
office at the WTO is the "Permanent Mission of the Separate Customs
Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu."
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the "Permanent Mission" has "sovereignty"
implications, Beijing has asked the WTO Secretariat to change
Taiwan's designation to the "Permanent Representative Office" in line
with the formula adopted by Hong Kong and Macau.
</P>
<P>
In response to the TAUP's appeal, Foreign Affairs Ministry
spokesman Michel Lu reiterated that the Foreign Ministry has never
asked Taiwan's WTO mission to waiver its formal diplomatic title
granted by the Swiss government.
</P>
<P>
Despite Beijing's intention to degrade Taiwan's international
position, Lu said, Taiwan's status in the WTO remains unchanged
thanks to untiring efforts by the WTO mission.
</P>
<P>
According to Lu, the Beijing authorities pushed for the WTO
Secretariat to downgrade Taiwan to the level of a local government by
changing the designation of its mission last year when the
secretariat reprint the roster of WTO permanent member states.
</P>
<P>
The WTO is one of the few international organizations that admit
both Taiwan and China.

FORMER PRESIDENT TERMS ANTI-SECESSION LAW AS ACT OF AGGRESSION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 6 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former President Lee Teng-hui blasted China
Sunday for its plan to enact a so-called anti-secession law targeting
Taiwan, saying that such legislation is tantamount to an act of
aggression.
</P>
<P>
Lee, who is the so-called "spiritual leader" of the
pro-independence opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) , made the
remarks while addressing a joint graduation ceremony for three groups
of students who had completed their studies at the Lee Teng-hui
School.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing authorities are seeking to annex Taiwan by enacting
an anti-secession law that will probably provide China with a legal
basis to use force against the island, Lee pointed out, adding that
the people of Taiwan should join hands to block such a barbaric act
of aggression.
</P>
<P>
Lee urged the public to voice their strong protest against
China's proposed law to draw the international community's attention
to the growing military threat the island is facing.
</P>
<P>
The outspoken former president said that building a Taiwanese
identity and making the island a normal country are common goals of
all the people of Taiwan, while changing the country's official name
and writing a new constitution are the most important missions to be
achieved at the current stage.
</P>
<P>
Some people who are concerned over the future of Taiwan are
disappointed with the results of the Dec. 11 legislative elections,
during which the "pan-green camp" of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party and the TSU failed to win a majority in the new
legislature, Lee said, adding that it is inevitable to face
difficulties while pursuing a far-reaching goal.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the "pan-green camp's" setback in the legislative
elections shows that education on Taiwanese identity should be
further intensified, Lee disclosed that his school is planning to
organize a series of alumni forums aimed at integrating efforts of
local civic groups and TSU parliamentarians to help build a strong
Taiwanese identity.

TAIWAN PUSHING FOR FTA WITH MALAYSIA: MNNA

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Republic of China (Taiwan) is
pushing for a free trade agreement (FTA) with Malaysia in an attempt
to further prop up substantive ties between the two countries,
Taiwan's representative to Malaysia was quoted by the Malaysian
National News Agency (MNNA) as saying Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Wu Wen-ya, head of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in
Malaysia, was quoted by MNNA as saying that two-way trade between
Taiwan and Malaysia totaled US$6.5 billion in 2004, marking an
increase of 22 percent over the year-earlier level.
</P>
<P>
Taiwanese investments in Malaysia over the years have exceeded
US$9.5 billion, making Taiwan the third-largest source of foreign
capital, second only to the United States and Japan, Wu told the
MNNA.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Wu said, the number of Malaysian students seeking to
pursue advanced studies in Taiwan has reached 36,000, making the
Malaysians the largest foreign student group in Taiwan.
Currently, about 3,000 Taiwan students are studying in Malaysia and
about 1,200 Malaysians seek to go to Taiwan to study
every year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chou Mei-fen, a Malaysian vice minister of women,
family and community development who studied in Taiwan, said she will
push for closer cooperation between the ministry and the Taipei
Economic and Cultural Office in efforts to allow the Malaysian
government to recognize the academic degrees conferred to Malaysian
students by institutes from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
According to Chou, following the Malaysian government's
recognition of degrees from six Taiwan medical schools for Malaysian
graduates, the Malaysian Ministry of Health announced recently that
Malaysian graduates from the Department of Pharmaceutics in three
Taiwan universities can become pharmacists in Malaysia immediately
after they return to Malaysia.

OFFICIALS, CITIZENS RALLY TO OPPOSE BEIJING'S LEGISLATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A large number of people, including
officials and supporters of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) got together Sunday at a rally in Taipei to say "no" to
Beijing's imminent passage of an anti-secession law targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh, DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang and Presidential
Office Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun, among other officials,
delivered speeches at the rally to express opposition to Beijing's
attempts to annex Taiwan under the pretext of a Chinese law.
</P>
<P>
DPP Secretary-General Lee Yi-yang said in his speech that Beijing
will soon pass the anti-secession law, which he described as a law
that violates the principles of the international law and infringes
on the sovereignty of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
As the ruling party in Taiwan, the DPP must make its stance
clearly known to Beijing and win support from around the world on
this concern, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
He added that although the anti-secession law is a domestic law
of China, Beijing is poised to use it to deal with Taiwan, allowing
it to use force against Taiwan, another country.
</P>
<P>
Lee urged the opposition Kuomintang and the People First Party to
forgo the so-called "92 consensus" that runs counter to mainstream
public opinion in Taiwan and to instead throw their support behind
the DPP to jointly say "no" to China.
</P>
<P>
Other prominent figures that took part in the rally included
Executive Yuan Secretary-General Lee Ying-yuan, DPP legislative party
whip Lai Ching-teh, DPP Legislator-at-large Tsai Ying-wen and Wu
Li-pei, a senior presidential adviser.
</P>
<P>
A similar street rally was held in the southern port city of
Kaoshiung that same day, in which some 50,000 people took to the
streets to vent their anger with China's anti-secession legislation.
</P>
<P>
The rally, titled "Against Beijing's annexation of Taiwan, " was
sponsored by the Taiwan Solidarity Union, an ally of the DPP. It was
led by former President Lee Teng-hui, the TSU's so-called "spiritual
leader."

UNCERTAIN IF BEIJING WILL USE ANTI-SECESSION LAW AGAINST TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
San Francisco,  March 5 (CNA)
(By C. Chiang and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former U.S. Ambassador to China
James Lilley said Saturday that even if China enacts an
anti-secession law, it is uncertain that Beijing will take any action
against Taiwan in accordance with the law, as "law is what you say,
policy is what you do."
</P>
<P>
Lilley also served as former director of the American Institute
on Taiwan's Taipei Office, which has dealt with unofficial relations
between Taipei and Washington since Washington shifted its diplomatic
recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the annual meeting of the Taiwan-U.S. Science and
Technology Industry Association, Lilley noted that China passed a
bill in 1992 to include Taiwan and Tiaoyutai in its territory. "But
its a law, not policy, " he said, adding that China's current
enactment of an anti-secession law is similar to that of the earlier
law.
</P>
<P>
The anti-secession law itself is not a cross-Taiwan Strait
problem and only the escalation of tension by both sides of the
strait will cause problems, he further said, adding that he neither
sees tension in the Taiwan Strait nor any provocation from Taiwan to
challenge China. Lilley also said he believes Taipei and Beijing can
resolve their differences peacefully.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the United States does not want to hear the
Taiwan government remark that "if China attacks Taiwan, the United
States will protect the island."
</P>
<P>
According to Lilley, Taiwan's economic achievements and
democratic development can counter China's attacks, but the island
should also take responsibility for its own defense, including the
procurement of weapons from the United States.

RESTRICTIONS ON APPLICATIONS FOR INDONESIAN WORKERS LIFTED
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 6 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Restrictions over applications for the
employment of Indonesian workers will be lifted, effective
immediately, an official of the Bureau of Employment and Vocational
Training (BEVT) under the Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs
(CLA) said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the resolution to lift restrictions
was adopted at the First Taiwan-Indonesia Labor Committee Meeting
jointly presided over by BEVT Director-General Kuo Fang-yu and Gusti
Made Arka, director-general of the Overseas Labor Placement Bureau
under the Indonesian Manpower and Transmigration Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Under the resolution, the CLA will begin to accept and handle all
applications for employment of Indonesian workers, while
controversial cases, if any, will be investigated with the BEVT's
help in order to shorten the investigation time and expedite the
handling procedure, the official said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the official went on, both parties also agreed to
set up a channel for "direct employment" to reduce Indonesian
laborers' financial burden to unscrupulous labor brokers and enhance
workers' physical checkup quality control.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan lifted a freeze on imports of workers from Indonesia late
last year, ending a two-year-and-four-month hiatus, but many
restrictions over applications were still imposed.
</P>
<P>
The CLA imposed an across-the-board ban on the import of
Indonesian workers Aug. 1, 2002 in retaliation for Indonesia's
failure to cooperate with Taiwan in fixing the high absconding rate
of Indonesian workers in Taiwan, as well as unreasonable brokerage
fees charged by Indonesian brokers.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are about 24,000 Indonesian workers in Taiwan,
ranking fourth in terms of the number of foreign laborers working on
the island.

T-COMMERCE A NEW CASH COW IN TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Television commerce, better known as
T-commerce, is a new cash cow industry poised to change Taiwan's
consumer purchase habits as well as create a new marketing system for
traders.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a symposium on integration of service industries and
the inspiration of T-commerce, Government Information Office
Director-General Lin Chia-lung said that T-commerce generated
business worth over NT$30 billion (approximately US$1 billion) in
Taiwan last year, an amount exceeding the total yielded by all cable
TV channels in Taiwan the same year.
</P>
<P>
Lin said that T-commerce operators are optimistic that similar
business will shoot up to the tune of NT$100 billion in three or five
years.
</P>
<P>
The GIO head, who is the top official in charge of Taiwan's
television, broadcasting and related affairs, said that although this
new business area deserves support and encouragement, it also needs
proper control to prevent it from eventual failure as a result of
fighting and competition.
</P>
<P>
Also addressing the symposium, Gary Wang, chairman of the General
Chamber of Commerce of the Republic of China, which is co-sponsoring
the symposium, said that "shopless" retail sales such as T-commerce
generated a total of NT$61.9 billion in business transactions in
Taiwan last year, up 12 percent over that posted in 2002.
</P>
<P>
Although T-commerce is still relatively a new business in Taiwan,
Wang said, its business turnover has grown by leaps and bounds in the
last two years to constitute 2.1 percent of the business turnover
posted by the entire retail business sector in Taiwan in 2004.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan's T-commerce has been growing at a pace faster
than that in the United States and Japan, Wang suggested that the
government include the T-commerce industry into the "Digital Taiwan
Project" that is already underway.
</P>
<P>
Wang is the CEO of the Eastern T-Commerce Channel, one of the
major T-commerce operators in Taiwan, and an affiliate of the Eastern
Multimedia Group.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chen Po-chih, chairman of the Taiwan Thinktank,
another co-sponsor of the symposium, said T-commerce is regarded as a
cash-making machine, with profits snowballing.
</P>
<P>
T-commerce, which has "the disparities of small-amount sales" as
a unique characteristic, offers a new niche for small- and
medium-sized enterprises in Taiwan seeking business breakthroughs,
Chen noted.
</P>
<P>
He warned, however, that the government should oversee the
development of T-commerce properly so as to prevent it from becoming
a cartel of business circulation and distribution.

TAIWAN WILL NEVER PROVOKE CHINA: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 6 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh claimed Sunday that
Taiwan will "never provoke China" and that China's leaders should be
held responsible for any tension in the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a rally organized by the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) in Taipei to express its opposition to Beijing's imminent
passage of an anti-secession law targeting Taiwan, Hsieh said that
Taiwan should continue to make efforts to show the international
community that Taiwan is a peace-loving nation.
</P>
<P>
The National People's Congress, China's rubber-stamp parliament,
is scheduled to screen the proposed law March 8.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is an independent sovereign nation with the official
designation of the Republic of China, the premier noted, adding that
any change to the country's status quo must be subject to the consent
of the 23 million people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Although Beijing is trying to make the so-called Taiwan issue a
domestic affair, Taiwan has achieved a great breakthrough in
internationalizing the matter in light of a recent joint statement
from the U.S.-Japan Security Consultative Committee that lists the
peaceful resolution of issues concerning the Taiwan Strait through
dialogue as one of their common strategic objectives.
</P>
<P>
He criticized Beijing's proposed anti-secession law for trying to
unilaterally change the status quo of the Taiwan Strait and for
trying to purport that the issue is an internal rather than an
international affair.
</P>
<P>
A large number of people, including government officials and DPP
supporters got together at the rally to say "no" to Beijing's
attempts to annex Taiwan under the pretext of the proposed law.
</P>
<P>
Other prominent figures that took part in the rally included
Presidential Office Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun, Executive Yuan
Secretary-General Lee Ying-yuan, DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang, DPP
Secretary-General Lee Yi-yang, DPP legislative party whip Lai
Ching-teh, DPP Legislator-at-large Tsai Ying-wen and Wu Li-pei, a
senior presidential adviser.

TSU TO PROMOTE LEGISLATION AGAINST BEIJING'S ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  6 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The pro-independence opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) will present a draft anti-annexation of Taiwan
bill at the Legislative Yuan in retaliation for Beijing's proposed
anti-secession law, TSU legislative whip Lo Chih-ming said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Given that the National People's Congress, China's rubber-stamp
parliament, is scheduled to screen the proposed law, which is
believed to target Taiwan, Lo said that his party has elaborated a
five-article draft bill on the anti-annexation of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The draft bill clearly defines the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
as two separate sovereign nations and that the territories under
Taiwan's effective jurisdiction include Taiwan proper, Penghu,
Kinmen, Matsu, the Dongsha (Pratas) Islands, the Nansha (Spratly)
Islands, Green Island and Orchid Island, Lo revealed.
</P>
<P>
The draft bill also stipulates that any changes to Taiwan's
status quo and other matters related to the country's sovereignty and
future must be subject to the consent of the people of Taiwan
demonstrated through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan will never accept any decision on its future that is made
through non-peaceful means, including economic sanctions, embargo,
unilateral legislation or intervention in Taiwan's internal affairs,
it adds.
</P>
<P>
Both the president and parliament would be authorized to initiate
a referendum on measures to be taken by the government should the
country face the threat of annexation, invasion or intimidation, it
says.
</P>
<P>
The president should inform the parliament immediately if he
decides to take measures against any kind of threat, including
suspending all exchanges and communications with China, according to
the TSU draft bill.
</P>
<P>
The content of the draft bill will be increased in tune with the
final outcome of Beijing's anti-secession law, Lo said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Legislator Ker Chien-ming, chief of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party's Policy Coordination Committee, said
the DPP will adopt a wait-and-see attitude toward Beijing's
legislation, as the Legislative Yuan has already issued an official
statement to express its opposition to the proposed anti-secession
law.
</P>
<P>
The DPP is the largest party in the 225-member Legislative Yuan
with 89 seats, while the TSU controls just 12 seats.

TAIWAN OFFICIAL VOICES OPPOSITION TO ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
New York,  March 6 (CNA)
(By Eric Tseng and Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Taiwan official in Chicago urged China
Sunday to take Taiwan's positive efforts to maintain cross-Taiwan
Strait peace seriously prior to enacting an "anti-secession law"
which is expected to upset regional stability.
</P>
<P>
Ben Shao, director of the Information Division at the Taipei
Economic and Cultural Office in Chicago, made the call in a letter to
the editor entitled "Disturbing the Peace" in the Chicago Sun-Times.
</P>
<P>
Shao said China's plan to pass the law is worthy of the world's
serious concern.
</P>
<P>
"Beijing wishes, by making such a law, to unilaterally define and
then change the status quo of the Taiwan Strait. When and if matters
run out of control, the outcome would require a response from the
United States," Shao warned.
</P>
<P>
Shao expressed his approval of the U.S. government's opposition
to the European Union's plan to lift its arms embargo against China,
which he said has increased its number of deployed missiles targeting
Taiwan to more than 700.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the bellicosity of China, Taiwan is a positive
player in East Asia which has a pluralistic society with a vibrant
democracy and robust economy and which readily gives back the fruits
of its success to the international community, Shao said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that maintaining cross-strait peace and security
is the desire of the people of the Taiwan and the wish of the
international community.
</P>
<P>
While making a trip to Taipei last week, former U.S. President
Bill Clinton called on China and Taiwan to set aside their
differences because "our common humanity matters more," Shao noted.
</P>
<P>
"For Beijing to continue to distort Taiwan's democratization and
reject President Chen Shui-bian's repeated offering of the olive
branch will lead China nowhere," Shao said.
</P>
<P>
"For its own good, China should heed the voices of the global
village," he added.

adopt active measures to oppose the law.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was jointly organized by a local Taiwanese
expatriate association and other Taiwanese-American organizations in
Dallas in front of the monument to former U.S. President John F.
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
A leading member of the association said that China will
officially pass its proposed anti-secession bill into law in the
coming few days in order to create a legal excuse to use force
against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan people should loudly voice their desire before the
Chinese National People's Congress votes on the bill, he said, adding
that the 23 million people of Taiwan should decide their own future.
</P>
<P>
An advisor to the association also said that the anti-secession
law is in preparation to swallow Taiwan up and that all the freedom
and democracy-loving people of the world should stand up to jointly
oppose such a law.
</P>
<P>
Concerned that Taiwanese tourists and businesspeople in China
could be arrested if their words violate the anti-secession law, the
advisor said that protesting against the law will not only protect
Taiwan's security, but will also protect the security of those
Taiwanese on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Wu Ming-kee, president of the Formosan Association for Public
Affairs, a pro-Taiwan organization in the United States, stressed
during the demonstration that as U.S. President George W. Bush had
said in his inauguration speech that he would stand by free nations
forever, Washington should clearly express its opposition to the
anti-secession law.
</P>
<P>
Besides the demonstration held in Dallas, rallies organized by
other Chinese-American organizations in the United States have also
been held in cities around the country, including Houston, Chicago
and Washington, D.C., over the past few days.
</P>
<P>
The organizations have urged the U.S. Congress to ask the Bush
administration to press Beijing not to enact the law.

BIOLOGICAL SON OF LATE ROC PRESIDENT TO BEGIN USING SURNAME CHIANG
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  7 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition Kuomintang Legislator John
Chang, an illegitimate son of the late President Chiang Ching-kuo,
confirmed Monday that he will officially begin using the surname
Chiang from today to "reflect the truth."
</P>
<P>
Chang confirmed that the process of officially changing his name
to Chiang has been completed. He applied for the name change with the
Ministry of the Interior in May 2002.
</P>
<P>
From Monday, Chang said, he will formally begin going by the name
John Chiang, which appears on his new identification card.
</P>
<P>
"My three adult children support my decision, and they will also
follow suit by changing their surname soon, " Chiang said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the Legislative Yuan, Chiang -- who
along with his twin brother Winston Chang were born in Gueilin in the
southwestern mainland province of Guangxi in 1941 to parents Chiang
Ching-kuo and Chang Ya-juo out of wedlock -- said his name-change is
basically a family affair.
</P>
<P>
"I made the decision after extensive discussions with members of
my immediate family and relatives. The change represents a respect
for history, a return to the facts, and a realization of my parents'
wishes," Chiang said.
</P>
<P>
Chiang, a former minister of foreign affairs and KMT
secretary-general, said that it is no longer a secret that Chiang
Ching-kuo is his birth father.
</P>
<P>
"Not only are the people of Taiwan well aware of this fact, but
also a large number of mainland Chinese residents know about it, " he
said.
</P>
<P>
Chiang added that he and his family will travel to the mainland
in April to sweep the tombs of the Chiang ancestors.
</P>
<P>
Chiang and his twin brother, who died of a stroke in Taipei
several years ago, were raised by their maternal grandmother after
their mother died when they were still infants. Until now, Chiang's
ID card had listed his uncle Chang Hau-juo and aunt Chi Chen as his
parents.
</P>
<P>
Chiang, the only surviving son of the late president, is now
serving his second term as an opposition KMT lawmaker.

JAPAN'S VISA WAIVER INAPPLICABLE TO TOP 5 ROC OFFICIALS: MINISTER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's top five officials are still
required to apply for a visa if they decide to visit Japan during the
2005 World Exposition in the central Japanese prefecture of Aichi,
Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen said Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, Japan's visa exemption privilege for
Republic of China citizens during the Aichi world exposition, also
known as Aichi Expo, does not apply to the nation's top five
officials -- President Chen Shui-bian, Vice President Annette Lu,
Premier Frank Hsieh, Vice Premier Wu Rong-i and Tan Sun Chen himself.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while presiding over the opening of a
diplomatic affairs training camp for volunteer workers in the
Nanyuan Ranch in the southern county of Tainan.
</P>
<P>
As part of its efforts to attract more tourists to the Aichi
Expo, the Japanese government has decided to waive visa requirements
for ROC passport holders from March 11 through Sept.25.
</P>
<P>
However, Chen said the Japanese government has imposed certain
restrictions, including that the above-mentioned five officials still
have to apply for a visa if they want to visit Japan during that
period.
</P>
<P>
For fear of offending China, Japan has traditionally been
reluctant to issue visas to senior ROC leaders. The eco-friendly
Aichi Expo is scheduled to open March 25 and last through Sept. 25.
To attract more foreign visitors, Japan has decided to offer
visa-free entry to South Korean and Taiwan tourists between March and
September. South Korea is Japan's largest source of foreign tourists,
followed by Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
As Japan does not maintain formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan,
the Japanese Diet passed special regulations Feb. 16 to allow Taiwan
citizens to enter Japan without a visa for a maximum 90-day stay
between March 11 and Sept. 25.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the diplomatic affairs training camp, Minister Chen
said China's diplomatic suppression against Taiwan has not eased
since the meeting between President Chen and opposition People First
Party Chairman James Soong.
</P>
<P>
"The Taiwan people generally feel that the domestic political
divisions between the ruling and opposition camps have been tempered
following the Feb. 24 Chen-Soong meeting," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, our diplomatic situation remains difficult.
Despite the smooth operations of the unprecedented two-way, non-stop
charter flights across the Taiwan Strait during the Chinese Lunar New
Year holiday, China has not slowed its diplomatic offensive against
Taiwan in the international arena.China will not hesitate to suppress
Taiwan diplomatically simply because of the Chen-Soong meeting, " he
added.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that diplomacy is a symbol of national sovereignty,
Chen said the Taiwan people should use every possible means to
support and assist in the government's diplomatic work.
</P>
<P>
With China's rise as a economic powerhouse, Chen said, Beijing
has been using its new economic clout to step up its diplomatic
squeeze against Taiwan.

CHINA WON'T SHOW TAIWAN MERCY: ROC FOREIGN MINISTER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Tainan  County,  March  7 (CNA)
(By P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Foreign Affairs Minister Chen
Tan-sun said Monday in Tainan County that the easing of the crisis
between Taiwan and China since the "Chen-Soong meeting" is only a
"false, short-term phenomenon, " claiming that China will not show
mercy in its efforts to suppress Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the comments while presiding over a ceremony to
mark the opening of a diplomatic research camp in the county.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that most of the Taiwan people feel the domestic
political atmosphere has improved since President Chen Shui-bian met
with opposition People First Party Chairman James Soong Feb. 24, the
minister, however, said that the island still faces difficulties and
challenges in developing its relations with other countries due to
China's continued diplomatic offensive to isolate the country
internationally.
</P>
<P>
Chen and Soong reached an agreement during their meeting on
various issues relating to constitutional reform, cross-strait
relations and other matters.
</P>
<P>
Saying that China's economy has vastly improved in recent years
and that Taiwanese businesspeople have played a significant role in
this development, the minister reminded the Taiwan people not to be
misled by China as Beijing will "not show mercy to Taiwan" just
because of the holding of a"Chen-Soong meeting."
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan people should intuitively perceive the difficulties
faced by the government in promoting foreign relations and should
support the government, he further said, adding that this will become
the new thought of Taiwan's future diplomatic work.

INVESTIGATIONS INTO PRESIDENTIAL SHOOTING SHOULD CONTINUE: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 3 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh recognized Monday the
efforts of law enforcement agencies in achieving what they described
as a "major breakthrough" in the investigations into the election-eve
shooting of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu
last March and said that similar efforts should continue until the
truth is uncovered.
</P>
<P>
The State Public Prosecutor-General's Office under the Supreme
Court announced Monday that the police had achieved a major
breakthrough in the investigations, naming Chen Yi-hsiung, a resident
of the southern city of Tainan, as the major suspect in the shooting,
in which two bullets grazed Chen and Lu as they campaigned in an
open-topped jeep in Tainan City one day ahead of the March 20
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The police reported that Chen Yi-hsiung, who was found drowned in
a canal in Anping, Tainan City, on March 28 last year, is so far the
most likely suspect, based on videotapes of the scene, related
evidence and witness accounts.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh issued the directive that investigations should continue to
find if Chen had any accomplices or whether he was manipulated by a
crime ring.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh lauded the law enforcement authorities' endless efforts
over nearly a year and claimed that the newly achieved breakthrough
will contribute to stabilizing social and political conditions.
</P>
<P>
The premier added that if necessary, the government should invite
Henry Lee, a renowned Chinese-American forensic scientist who led an
expert team to Taiwan to conduct forensic investigations into the
shooting last April, to make another visit to Taiwan to further
deepen the investigations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hou You-yi, director of the Criminal Investigation
Bureau under the National Police Administration, who concurrently
serves as deputy convener of the 319 shooting investigative team,
said during a news conference designed to explain details of the
progress of the investigations that now that Chen Yi-hsiung is
believed to be the most likely suspect, the police will continue
other efforts to crack the case, including the whereabouts of the gun
used in the attack.
</P>
<P>
The investigators will continue to track a man in a grey jacket
as well as four other men and one woman that appeared in the "hot
zone" of the videotapes showing the scene on the street where the
shooting occurred, Hou said.
</P>
<P>
Hou added that although Chen Yi-hsiung's family claim to have no
idea about the gun Chen allegedly used, they said they would help the
police find the weapon by offering several possible places that Chen
might have hidden it.
</P>
<P>
Hou said during the press conference that the 319 shooting
investigative team has concluded that Chen Yi-hsiung was most likely
the shooter based on three major accounts: that he appeared in all
three videotapes taken by a jewelry shop near the scene, that he
apparently changed his style of attire after March 19, 2004 and
according to his wife, his temperament changed drastically after that
day, and that his family claim to have met secretly March 30, after
Chen had died, to decide to keep silent about Chen. They also burned
three copies of a will that they alleged Chen left.
</P>
<P>
President Chen beat his sole challenger, opposition Kuomintang
Chairman Lien Chan, in the presidential election by a slim margin.
Lien filed two lawsuits in an attempt to nullify Chen's re-election
victory. The Taiwan High Court rejected the re-election annulment
suit, but Lien appealed the case to the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Many opposition politicians and supporters have disseminated
outrageous speculation about the shooting, including allegations that
it was staged by Chen to sway sympathy votes in his favor.

POLICE IDENTIFIES SUSPECT IN PRESIDENT'S SHOOTING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 7 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man who died in a suspected suicide a
year ago has been identified as a suspect in last year's election-eve
shooting of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu,
police said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Police traced Chen Yi-hsiung three months after they found the
maker of the two home-made bullets used in the shooting of March 19,
2004, according to Hou Yu-ih, commissioner of the Criminal
Investigation Bureau and a key member of a special task force probing
the shooting.
</P>
<P>
According to police, Chen had obtained a remodeled gun and
bullets from a criminal ring led by Tang Shou-yi and that his image
also appears in three videotapes taken near the crime scene at the
time of the shooting -- when the president and vice president were
greeting well-wishers in an open-topped jeep on the campaign trail in
Tainan City.
</P>
<P>
After checking with Chen's family, police decided that he "could
have" committed the shooting to vent his resentment at the political
situation, Hou said.
</P>
<P>
The family told police that Chen appeared rather depressed after
police released March 26 the image of a "bald man in a yellow shirt"
who they were looking for, and when asked by his wife if he was
involved in the shooting, Chen said "I'll take care of the things I
did," Hou said.
</P>
<P>
According to Hou, Chen later had his wife shave off his sideburns
and burned the yellow shirt that he wore on the day of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
On March 28, Chen was found drowned wearing a new suit and shoes
in the fishing port of Anping, and the family later destroyed three
letters he allegedly left for his wife, daughter and son, Hou said.
</P>
<P>
However, Wang Wen-chung, head of the Tainan City Police
Headquarters, pointed out that the case can only be declared resolved
if the letters and the gun used in the shooting are found.
</P>
<P>
Another suspect in the shooting, identified as Huang Hung-jen,
was also found dead at his home of a suspected self-inflicted gunshot
wound on May 26, 2004, according to police.
</P>
<P>
Although the gun used in the president's shooting has yet to be
found, the police are sure it was supplied by Tang through forensic
examination of the bullets, Hou said.
</P>
<P>
Police confirmed in December last year that Tang, an underground
gunsmith in southern Taiwan, was the maker of the two bullets used in
the shooting.
</P>
<P>
Tang was found to have remodeled a total of 53 guns, 39 of which
have been retrieved, Hou said.
</P>
<P>
Police have "pinpointed the whereabouts" of the other 14,
although they have not actually found them, according to Hou. He did
not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, police have screened 4,824 ex-convicts
involving in the illegal possession of firearms in addition to
carrying out raids on underground gun-remodeling outfits.
</P>
<P>
Police have also checked on 434 people appearing in videotapes
taken at the crime scene, including 46 in a "hot zone" considered to
be the most likely spot from where the shooter fired the shots.
</P>
<P>
Four recognizable people have not been identified, while the
images of two other men are unclear and six others are totally
unrecognizable, police said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in an effort to single out suspicious individuals,
police have also examined more than 7.1 million households
islandwide.
</P>
<P>
The opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and People
First Party has alleged that the shooting, which left President Chen
and Vice President Lu slightly injured, was set up by the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party to give it an advantage in the March 20
election.

A Tainan man allegedly responsible for last
year's presidential election-eve shooting of President Chen Shui-bian
and Vice President Annette Lu was said by his acquaintances Monday to
be a supporter of the opposition "pan-blue alliance."
</P>
<P>
Chen Yi-hsiung, who was found drowned in a suspected suicide
March 28, 2004, was reported by police earlier in the day to be a
suspect in the March 19 shooting.
</P>
<P>
According to workers at a Tainan wrestling association that Chen
had headed, he was a silent and honest man who had a deep interest in
politics.
</P>
<P>
A 30-year neighbor of Chen said he was a supporter of the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and People First
Party and had argued with others in public because of differences in
political preferences.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chen's neighbors said they were surprised to hear of
his drowning, because he was known to be a good swimmer and diver.

POLICE TO CONTINUE TO LOOK INTO 319 SHOOTING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 7 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police said Monday that they will continue
to look into suspicious points surrounding the election-eve shooting
of President Chen Shui-bian last year, even though they claim to have
identified the key suspect in the case.
</P>
<P>
In what they claimed was a "major breakthrough," police announced
that Chen Yi-hsiung, a former head of the Wrestling Commission of the
Tainan Training Association, is the key suspect in the shooting that
slightly injured the president and Vice President Annette Lu March
19, 2004, when they were canvassing in an open-topped jeep in Tainan,
southern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen later won by a razor-thin margin of a little more than
25,000 votes against his rival out of more than 13 million votes
cast. Despite having no evidence to support their allegations, the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" accused the president of staging the
shooting to win sympathy votes.
</P>
<P>
Police said that although the key suspect died March 28, they
will continue to look into his connections and the possible locations
of the gun he is alleged to have used, and the distribution of the
guns sold by the underground gunsmith alleged to have sold him the
gun, as well as screening suspicious figures videotaped near the "hot
zone" of the shooting scene.
</P>
<P>
Hou Yu-ih, commissioner of the Criminal Investigation Bureau,
also attempted to explain why it had taken so long for police to make
their breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
Hou said that Chen Yi-hsiung has long been on a list of suspects,
as he was one of the figures who appeared in the videotapes taken at
the crime scene.
</P>
<P>
Hou pointed out that Chen was found drowned and that when his
body was recovered the following day, his family is alleged to also
have found three suicide notes. The family decided to cremate his
body hastily to avoid an autopsy and never to discuss the matter. The
alleged notes were also burned by the family and the police did not
explain why the family broke its silence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wang Wen-chung, chief of the Tainan Police Bureau,
said it is not easy to determine if Chen's family will bear criminal
responsibility for failing to come forward, but he pointed out that
should Chen one day prove to have been the shooter, the family will
not be able to claim the reward of NT$53 million (US$1.72 million)
as they did not supply the information voluntarily.

Minister of Education Tu Cheng-sheng
exhorted the Kinmen Institute of Technology (KIT) Monday to further
globalize its teaching and development so as to make it the
locomotive of education in all outlying islands of the Republic of
China.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a ceremony to mark the inauguration of the KIT First
Dormitory, Tu said the institute should strive to attract more youths
from Kinmen families that have emigrated abroad to return to Kinmen
to study. 
</P>
<P>
Should Kinmen, which is known as one of the "hometowns of
overseas Chinese, " succeed in attracting more youths from Kinmen
families residing abroad, it will also contribute to Kinmen's
economic development and investment, as the arrival of students will
bring about closer ties and exchanges, Tu said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tu said, the KIT can also be an option for China-based
Taiwanese businessmen when they are choosing where to send their
children to study.
</P>
<P>
The KIT, the highest level educational institute in all ROC-held
outlying islands, can also be an option for China-based Taiwanese
businessmen themselves who intend to pursue advanced studies, such
as EMBAs, Tu added.
</P>
<P>
According to Tu, the KIT became operational in the autumn of
2004. Of the students it received last year, 93 percent were from
Taiwan proper while only some 7 percent were from Kinmen and
Matsu, another ROC-held outlying island located even closer
to the coast of China.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Tu, a number of officials and local government
leaders, including Kinmen Magistrate Lee Chu-feng, attended the
ceremony to inaugurate the dormitory, construction of which carried a
price tag of NT$101.86 million (US$3.28 million), fully footed by the
Ministry of Education.
</P>
<P>
Also addressing the ceremony, Lee suggested that the KIT open its
door to students from China, making the institute an "experimental
point" from which Taiwan democracy can be channeled into China via
education.
</P>
<P>
In response to Lee's suggestion, the education minister said that
this idea would involve the country's China policy, which is under
the charge of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council.

ANNUAL INCREASE OF CPI UP BY 1.94 PERCENT IN FEBRUARY: DGBAS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 7 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The consumer price index (CPI) rose by 1.94
percent in February, thanks to the Chinese New Year holiday, the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
DGBAS officials said some commodities and certain services, such
as babysitters, housemaids, beauty parlors and taxis traditionally
impose extra fees during the Chinese New Year holiday, which is why
the CPI in February increased by 0.64 percent from January.
</P>
<P>
As Chinese New Year fell in January last year, the comparison
base was comparatively lower, making the CPI annual increase in
February surge 1.94 percent when compared with the same period of
last year, representing a new high since last October.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that the annual increase of the wholesale
price index (WPI) in February was 2.62 percent mainly because
international oil prices were still hovering at a high level.
</P>
<P>
The WPI in February was down by 0.2 percent from January, mainly
because the price of electric parts was down and because of the
appreciation of the new Taiwan dollar against the U.S. dollar.

<P>
The Industrial Technology Research
Institute (ITRI) and the Netherlands Organization for Applied
Scientific Research (TNO) signed a memorandum of understanding Monday
to boost research and development cooperation and exchanges between
the two institutions.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, which was entered into at a ceremony
witnessed by ITRI President Johnsee Lee and TNO Vice President Cees
van Duyvendijk, both parties will focus their cooperation on research
and development of herbal medicine using systems biological
technology in the initial stages.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, Lee said the TNO is a non-government
organization funded by the Netherlands Ministry of Education, Culture
and Science as well as the Ministry of National Defense and that its
research scope includes life sciences, environmental, information and
communication technology, and defense industry technology.
</P>
<P>
Lee pointed out that TNO and ITRI have already started
cooperation in research and development of herbal medicine, adding
that several ITRI researchers are stationed in TNO laboratories where
they are conducting research.
</P>
<P>
After completing herbal medicine research and development
projects, the two institutions will extend their cooperative ties to
other fields, such as nanotechnology, opto-electronics and flat panel
displays, Lee said.

DPP TO STAGE NATIONWIDE DEMONSTRATION IF BEIJING LAW HURTS TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 7 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) said Monday that if Beijing's proposed anti-secession law tries
to change the cross-Taiwan Strait status quo or hurts the national
interests of Taiwan, it will stage a nationwide demonstration to
underscore the Taiwan people's determination to vehemently oppose the
law.
</P>
<P>
DPP Secretary-General Lee Yi-yang issued the statement following
remarks made by DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang the previous day.
</P>
<P>
Su said during a "defend Taiwan, oppose annexation" rally in
Taipei that the DPP will mobilize a large-scale demonstration if
Beijing passes the proposed law that tramples on Taiwan's dignity and
squeezes the rights of the Taiwan people. President Chen Shui-bian,
who did not take part in Sunday's rally, will also take to the
streets with the people in such a rally, Su assured those present at
the rally.
</P>
<P>
Lee outlined "three ifs" upon which holding a large-scale
demonstration will depend: if the anti-secession law stipulates
punishment, persecution or extradition of Taiwan people; if it allows
sanctions, boycotts or the use of violent methods to change the
cross-strait status quo; or if it threatens the existence of the
Taiwan people, sabotages the basis of Taiwan's democracy and freedom,
or hurts the nation's basic interests.
</P>
<P>
Lee pointed out that the key tensions in cross-strait relations
lies in Beijing's refusal to recognize the independent sovereignty of
the nation, its threat of force and deployment of missiles to
threaten the peace and security of the Taiwan Strait, and its harsh
methods used to squeeze Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The legislation of the anti-secession law will only make the
problem worse, Lee said, urging Beijing to reflect upon its policy
toward Taiwan and not to further hurt the feelings of the Taiwan
people.
</P>
<P>
Tung Li-wen, director of the DPP's Department of Chinese Affairs,
also said that the DPP cherishes every opportunity to ease
cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
But he strongly questioned the formulation of the anti-secession
law, describing it as "a sugar-coated bomb" that will be the
beginning of legal warfare and provocation of cross-strait peace on
the part of Beijing.

PREMIER VOWS TO PROMOTE GENDER EQUALITY IN POLICYMAKING

<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Monday that the
government is determined to eliminate gender discrimination and to
implement gender equality in political participation and the policy
formulation process.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the pledge while attending an activity promoting
women's rights on the eve of March 8 International Women's Day.
</P>
<P>
Noting that women account for half of Taiwan's population, Hsieh
said women have contributed greatly to the nation's development over
the decades.
</P>
<P>
"We have had many outstanding career women. In public service,
female civil servants are known for their diligence and integrity.
There have been few corruption cases involving female civil servants,
" Hsieh said, adding that he is convinced women can play an even more
important role in the political arena if they are given the
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
Now that it has achieved its economic miracle, Hsieh said, Taiwan
should continue to create a "cultural miracle" to deepen Taiwan's
values in promoting freedom, democracy, human rights and gender
equality.
</P>
<P>
"We should work together to ensure co-existence and cooperation
between the genders, " Hsieh said, adding that he hopes the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait will give up the arms race and instead compete
in promoting women's rights and welfare services.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Minister of the Interior Su
Jia-chyuan said women have traditionally assumed more of the burden
of duty in caring for elderly family members, child-rearing and
household chores than their male counterparts.
</P>
<P>
"We should pay more heed to women's opinions, give them a greater
say in policy making and assist them in resolving the dilema of
balancing career and family life," Su said.
</P>
<P>
During the "Let Women's Dreams Come True" activity, a film was
screened introducing the aspirations and dreams of local women in
different age groups and at various social levels. The program was
also aimed at inviting local people to select a song that can best
represent or reflect Taiwan women's merits and virtues.

KAOHSIUNG UNIVERSITY TO OPEN IEMBA CLASSES IN VIETNAM
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 7 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
National University of Kaohsiung (NUK) is
planning to open IEMBA classes in Vietnam to facilitate studies by
key employees of Taiwanese-operated companies in that country, NUK
President Huang Ying-chung disclosed Monday.
</P>
<P>
Huang said that he will lead a group of NUK executives on a trip
to Vietnam to negotiate with Vietnamese officials over the technical
details of the cooperative project.
</P>
<P>
If everything goes smoothly, Huang said, NUK will begin to
solicit students wishing to attend IEMBA classes in May and classes
will start in September.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese government officials and entrepreneurs will also be
welcome to attend the planned IEMBA classes, thus contributing to
academic exchanges between the two countries, according to Huang.
</P>
<P>
Huang further said that NUK is also considering opening EMBA
classes in cooperation with the Kinmen county government so that
China-based Taiwanese manufacturers can study on the outlying island
that lies closer to the Chinese coast than it does to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Managers of Taiwanese-operated companies in China have been keen
to take EMBA courses in the past, but now most of them choose to
study in Taiwan because diplomas issued by schools in China are not
recognized by the Ministry of Education, Huang noted.
</P>
<P>
To help Taiwanese manufactures save time and money, Huang added,
his university will open EMBA classes at the Kinmen Institute of
Technology (KIT).
</P>
<P>
The NUK head said the program will not only enrich Taiwanese
manufacturers with advanced business management knowledge but will
also boost exchanges among Taiwan, Kinmen and China.

KMT MARCH 19 DEMONSTRATION TO GO AHEAD AS SCHEDULED
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 7 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) will stage
a large demonstration March 19 on the first anniversary of the
shooting of President Chen Shui-bian as scheduled to underscore the
damage they claim the incident has done to Taiwan democracy, a KMT
spokesman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chang Jung-kung was responding to questions as to whether the
demonstration will proceed as scheduled after police announced a
major breakthrough earlier that day that they have identified who
they think might have been the gunman in the shooting, although the
man committed suicide shortly after the shooting and no weapon has
been found. The KMT has refused to accept the finding.
</P>
<P>
According to Chang, March 19 marked a regression of Taiwan's
democracy, adding the KMT's belief that "two bullets swayed the
result of the presidential election" and that a national referendum
was held simultaneously with the March 20 presidential election,
which the KMT also disagreed with.
</P>
<P>
President Chen won the presidential election by a razor-thin
margin and the opposition "pan-blue alliance" has accused him of
staging the shooting to win sympathy votes, although it has failed to
provide evidence to substantiate the claim.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Li-wen, vice chairperson of KMT's Culture and
Communications Committee, said that the KMT, the New Party and the
People First Party (PFP), as well as various civic groups, will be
invited to take part in the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
She estimated that between 50,000 and 100,000 will take part in
the demonstration. The protestors will start at the Sungshan Tobacco
Factory and end on Ketagalan Boulevard in front of the Presidential
Office, Cheng said, adding that KMT Chairman Lien Chan will attend.
</P>
<P>
Upon hearing the demonstration will go ahead as scheduled, the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) urged the KMT to rethink
its decision.
</P>
<P>
DPP Secretary-General Lee Yi-yang said the party respects the
views of the experts involved in the investigations and supports
their tenacious efforts in solving the shooting.
</P>
<P>
If the KMT chooses to return to Ketagalan Boulevard as it did in
the massive protests following its election defeat last year, it will
signify a backpedalling of the party, according to Lee.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan has paid a hefty price in the past, " Lee said, adding
that now that the confrontational atmosphere has eased, there is no
reason to continue to incite feelings of hatred in the people and add
further to the rift in society.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a PFP spokesman said that the party will reflect upon
itself March 19 and will not take part in the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh Kung-ping noted that PFP Chairman James Soong led the
people to the streets last year over the shooting, but was accused by
the KMT as being a "violent and radical" party. Such comments have
"totally unnerved us," he said.
</P>
<P>
The PFP will not take part in the demonstration, although Hsieh
said the party still admires the participants for their courage in
pursuing the truth of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh's remarks came on the heels of a recent meeting between
Chen and Soong in a high-profile Feb. 24 meeting touted as
"inter-party reconciliation."

INVESTIGATORS' FINDINGS IN 319 SHOOTING DRAW PARTISAN RESPONSE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 7 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Political parties reacted along party lines
Monday to a special team of investigators' claims that they had
identified the the person who might have shot President Chen
Shui-bian March 19, 2004.
</P>
<P>
The March 19 assassination attempt on the president has been at
the center of a bitter dispute between the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and
People First Party (PFP) over the legitimacy of Chen's successful
re-election.
</P>
<P>
The KMT and PFP, which fielded a joint ticket in the presidential
race, claim that the assassination was a campaign trick choreographed
by Chen's camp to win over voters.
</P>
<P>
In addition to filing two lawsuits in attempt to deny Chen the
presidency, they formed the 319 Truth Investigation Commission to
carry out an investigation into the shooting.
</P>
<P>
The KMT has called for its supporters to take to the streets on
March 19, the anniversary of the shooting, to turn up the heat on the
government to get to the bottom of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
However, the government's investigation team consisting of
prosecutors and police detectives claimed earlier in the day that
they had identified a suspect, who apparently committed suicide March
28 last year.
</P>
<P>
Lawmaker Lai Chin-teh, the secretary-general of the DPP caucus at
the Legislative Yuan, welcomed Monday's finding, claiming that it
clears the president of suspicion that he staged the assassination to
win sympathy in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
He expressed thanks to the investigators, saying their findings
will promote the ongoing process of reconciliation between the DPP
and the opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Lai urged the KMT to call off its March 19 demonstration, saying
it will only prompt further upheaval rather than finding the truth.
</P>
<P>
The DPP's political ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, shared his
view. TSU Secretary-General Chen Chien-ming acknowledged the
investigators' hard work and called on the various political parties
to respect and affirm their findings and refrain from speculation
that will only impede the probe.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the KMT and PFP unanimously decried the investigators'
findings as unconvincing.
</P>
<P>
KMT Chairman Lien Chan shrugged off journalists' requests for
comment on the investigators' findings, but his aides said the KMT
chief finds them "ridiculous."
</P>
<P>
KMT Spokesman Chang Jung-kung said his party is worried that the
truth of the case might be buried forever now that the police have
pointing the finger at a dead person as the chief suspect.
</P>
<P>
"If that is the government's final reply to the mysterious
shooting, it only shows that the government has no intention of
getting to the bottom of the case and the Taiwan people, as well as
the international community, will keep questioning the fairness of
the 2004 presidential election," Chang claimed.
</P>
<P>
Citing six questions raised by the 319 Truth Investigation
Commission about the shooting, Chang said the government's claims
that the suspect has been found fails to address these questions.
</P>
<P>
PFP Spokesman Hsieh Kung-ping noted that the investigators timed
the revelation of their "major breakthrough" just two weeks before
the anniversary of the shooting and speculated that the timing is
apparently for "political purposes."
</P>
<P>
"Instead of stopping speculation, pointing to a deceased as the
suspect will only fuel the rumors," Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
PFP Legislator Lee Yung-ping, who is secretary of the PFP caucus
at the Legislative Yuan, said the findings will probably satisfy the
authorities but not the general public.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the investigators' inability to substantiate their
claims with evidence also proves the necessity of having the 319
Truth Investigation Commission, which ceased its work Jan. 19, carry
on its probe.
</P>
<P>
Commission spokeswoman Wang Chin-feng said the investigators'
findings have raised more questions than they have answered.
</P>
<P>
She said the investigators never mentioned the findings to her
commission during their interviews with the commission workers and
therefore there is a shadow of doubt cast over their findings.
</P>
<P>
However, she went on, her commission has been unable to get to the
bottom of the case because of a boycott by the DPP administration.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Council of Grand Justices has downgraded the
commission to an agency under the Legislative Yuan, which Wang
described as the nation's "most cruel political arena, " she said her
commission cannot carry out its job "independently" with such a
status and is not expected to conduct an investigation "free from
political interference."

Several legislators from the ruling and
opposition parties promised Monday to jointly introduce a resolution
at a meeting of the Legislative Yuan urging the Beijing authorities
to release all detained pro-democracy activists, including Dr. Wang
Bingzhang.
</P>
<P>
Ruling Democratic Progressive Party legislators Lin Cho-shui,
Hsiao Bi-khim, Chiu Chuang-chin and Chen Chung-hsin, as well as Wu
Chih-yang of the Kuomintang and Kao Szu-po of the People First Party
were attending a press conference jointly called by the World
Organization for Human Rights, the Chinese Association for Human
Rights and the Taiwan Association for Human Rights at the
legislature.
</P>
<P>
Kao said that Wang was jailed on suspicion of collecting
information for Taiwan's intelligence agencies, so the people of
Taiwan have an obligation to help the pro-democracy activist clear
himself of the false accusation.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Beijing authorities to shake hands with
political dissidents and to free Wang.
</P>
<P>
Lin said giving moral support to Chinese pro-democracy activists
will make them more confident in their efforts to promote democracy
in China and he voiced the hope that all 1.3 billion Chinese people
can one day enjoy the universal value of human rights.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Timothy Cooper, executive director of the World
Organization for Human Rights, thanked the legislators for their
support for all Chinese pro-democracy activists.

VP BLASTS CHINA OVER ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 7 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice President Annette Lu blasted China
Monday for its plan to enact a so-called anti-secession law targeting
Taiwan, saying that such legislation will upset peace across the
Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Lu made the remarks while receiving a delegation of the Jewish
Institute for National Security Affairs at the Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
"China's rubber-stamp parliament -- the National People's
Congress -- will begin to deliberate the so-called anti-secession law
March 8, thus making International Women's Day a non-peaceful day, "
Lu told her guests.
</P>
<P>
"Once the proposed anti-secession law is enacted, " Lu said,
"Taiwan will face a serious military threat from China as the new law
will provide Beijing with a legal basis for using force against the
country."
</P>
<P>
As for current cross-strait relations, Lu went on, the
maintenance of the status quo means "no unification, no independence
and no use of force." She added it is an undeniable fact that Taiwan
is an independent country with sovereignty, no matter what
designation it uses.
</P>
<P>
It is China that is trying to unilaterally change the status quo
of the Taiwan Strait because Beijing has constantly enhanced its
military intimidation of Taiwan, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Although Beijing officials have repeatedly declared that Taiwan
is a part of the People's Republic of China based on Resolution No.
2758 adopted by the United Nations in 1971, Lu said the U.N. only
granted China's seat to the PRC through the resolution, which
mentions nothing about Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
As for the "one China" principle recognized by the United States
in the 1972 Shanghai Comunique, Lu noted that it is still worth
discussing whether such a principle is acceptable to the 23 million
people of Taiwan who enjoy freedom, democracy and human rights.

TAIWAN'S FOREIGN TRADE DECREASES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 7 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's exports and imports amounted to
US$10.87 billion and US$11.77 billion in February, down 17.3 percent
and 10.8 percent year-on-year, respectively, according to statistics
released Monday by the Ministry of Finance (MOF).
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that Taiwan's foreign trade posted negative
growth in nearly two years, MOF Statistics Department Director Hsu
Kuo-chung said.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the decrease to relatively fewer working days in
the month due to the week-long Lunar New Year holiday.
</P>
<P>
Hsu predicted that the country's foreign trade will return to its
growth track in March, with exports moving up by 5.92 percent and
imports by 10.67 percent.
</P>
<P>
He also estimated that Taiwan's exports and imports will grow by
7.44 percent and 11.02 percent, respectively, in the first quarter of
this year.
</P>
<P>
For the first two months of this year, he added, Taiwan's exports
and imports expanded by 8.3 percent and 11.2 percent, respectively,
leaving a trade deficit of US$700 million.

TAIWAN WILL REVIEW POLICY AFTER CHINA'S ANTI-SECESSION LAW: OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  7 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government will review its policy
toward China if it enacts an anti-secession law, Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Calling the bill a show of "remarkable malice" against Taiwan, Wu
said this cannot be ignored because of Chinese President Hu Jintao's
seemingly gentle remarks about Taiwan March 4.
</P>
<P>
"The Mainland Affairs Council cares more about what Chinese
leaders are doing than what they are saying," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Although the MAC has no idea what the exact text of the
anti-secession law will be, information from various sources points
to the fact that the wording of the law has been considerably
softened by its author, apparently because of the serious concerns it
has raised in the international community and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The United States has played a significant role in the change, Wu
said, noting that U.S. officials who disapprove of China's move amid
an easing of tension across the Taiwan Strait had pressed China with
harsh words to temper the hostility displayed in the decision to
enact the law.
</P>
<P>
Instead of telling his office how to change tack in response to
the anti-secession law, the MAC chief said President Chen Shui-bian
respects the MAC's authority and has given it a blank check to carry
out reviews and adjustment.
</P>
<P>
Wu, however, refused to reveal what changes will take place
should China make the bill into law, saying it depends on the content
of the law and that in any case the fundamental principles of seeking
peace and development with China will not be changed.

PREMIER SUPPORTS CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS TO COUNTER BEIJING LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Tuesday he will
not hesitate to support the proposal to phase out the general
provisions of the existing Republic of China Constitution if Beijing
passes a law that allows it to attack Taiwan anytime and that makes
Taiwan a part of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the remarks at a Legislative Yuan interpellation
session where opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Su Chi asked
Hsieh about his stance on constitutional amendments.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said that each major domestic party has its own fundamental
stances on the constitutional amendment issue and that respecting the
existing ROC Constitution is a consensus of the ruling and opposition
parties.
</P>
<P>
While the opposition KMT and its "pan-blue alliance" ally -- the
People First Party -- think that the existing ROC Constitution is
good, Hsieh said the ruling Democratic Progressive Party thinks that
the constitution needs to be amended and updated in order to meet
current realities.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said that he personally supports the proposal to revise
certain provisions of the ROC Constitution. As to the extent of the
revisions, Hsieh said it will depend on the state of relations across
the Taiwan Strait.

U.S.-JAPAN JOINT STATEMENT NOT LINKED TO ANTI-SECESSION LAW: MAC HEAD
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 8 (CNA)
(By P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's top official in charge of mainland
affairs has said the joint statement issued by the United States and
Japan in February is a product of China's increasing military power
and has nothing to do with Beijing's proposed anti-secession law.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Wu, chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), made
the remarks in an exclusive interview conducted with the Central News
Agency Monday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Defense Secretary
Donald Rumsfeld, Japanese Foreign Minister Nobutaka Machimura and
Defense Minister Yoshinori Ohno held a security consultation meeting
in Washington, D.C., Feb. 19. In a joint statement after the meeting,
the U.S. and Japanese officials listed "encouraging a peaceful
resolution of issues concerning the Taiwan Strait through dialogue"
as part of their common strategic objectives in the Asia-Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that although Washington and Tokyo have voiced their
serious concerns about China's proposed anti-secession law, there is
no connection between their joint statement and the bill. He noted
Washington already had plans in place regarding the U.S.-Japan
relationship prior to U.S. President George W. Bush's inauguration
for a second term.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement is relevant to China's military deployments
and expansion in recent years, the MAC head said, adding that the
mainland's military deployment targeting Taiwan also poses threats to
other countries.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the Korean Peninsula and the Taiwan Strait are
two areas where a wider East Asian conflict could potentially erupt,
Wu said that the United States and Japan both feel that any
instability in these regions poses a direct threat to them.
</P>
<P>
On reports that Japan has recently paid more attention to the
Taiwan Strait issues, Wu said that the rapid and increased Chinese
military deployment has made Japan feel differently and that there
have been delicate changes in the relationship between Japan and
China. "China's hostility toward Japan has increased, and China's
defense white paper has also put more pressure on Japan," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
On Taiwan-Japan ties, the MAC head said that the Taiwan
government maintains very close unofficial relations with Japan,
adding that the two countries can also engage in a security dialogue
through an unofficial mechanism and that such dialogue can be
strengthened if necessary.

KEY POINTS OF BEIJING'S ANTI-SECESSION LAW UNVEILED
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Beijing,  March 8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China unveiled Tuesday the key points of
its proposed anti-secession law, including authorizing the State
Council and the Central Military Commission to take "non-peaceful"
action against Taiwan in certain situations.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhaoguo, a vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress -- China's rubber-stamp parliament --
unveiled the highlights of the controversial draft law in a report at
the parliament's ongoing plenary session.
</P>
<P>
Wang said peaceful reunification and the "one country, two
systems" scheme are Beijing's basic approach to achieving "peaceful
reunification."
</P>
<P>
However, he also stressed that China is entitled to use force to
check secessionist activities.
</P>
<P>
"Using non-peaceful means to stop secession in defence of our
sovereignty and territorial integrity would be a last resort for us,
after all our efforts for a peaceful reunification proved futile, "
Wang told mainland lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
He said the draft legislation, which is expected to be passed
next week, provides for the use of force "in the event that the
Taiwan independence forces should act under any name or by any means
to cause the fact of Taiwan's secession from China."
</P>
<P>
Beijing has yet to publicize the full text of the so-called
anti-secession law targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Wang's report focused on explaining the necessity and feasibility
of enacting the proposed law, the purpose and the scope of the law,
the nature of the so-called Taiwan issue, measures to realize
peaceful unification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, and the
use of "non-peaceful" means to stop secession activities.

MINISTER WOOS BRITISH INVESTMENT IN TAIWAN BANKS PRIVATIZATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
London,  March 7 (CNA)
(By  N.K. Han and Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Minister of Finance Lin Chuan on Monday
wooed British investment in the privatization of Taiwan's public
banks at an investment seminar in London.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to nearly 200 executives of British investment and
financial agencies at the seminar, Lin urged them to seize the
business and cooperation opportunities between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Lin said that the Ministry of Finance is slated to release late
next year its holdings of government shares of all Taiwan's public
banks except for the Bank of Taiwan to allow for a greater degree of
foreign ownership of domestic banks in line with a government
privatization project.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that Taiwan is poised to do so to sharpen its banking
industry's competitive edge as part of its bid to build Taiwan into a
regional financial hub, Lin assured that relevant legislation has
been underway to encourage mergers and consolidation among banks.
</P>
<P>
According to the finance minister, there are currently more than
50 banks in Taiwan, including 12 government-controlled ones that
account for more than 60 percent of the domestic banking industry's
assets. 
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that profits posted by the public banks
lag far behind those of private banks and that this is the reason
behind the government's decision to launch the privatization plan to
increase their profitabilities.
</P>
<P>
Council for Economic Planning and Development Vice Chairman Hsieh
Fa-ta and Financial Supervisory Commission Secretary-General Huang
Tien-mu also gave speeches at the seminar explaining Taiwan financial
policy and management.
</P>
<P>
Republic of China Representative to Britain Edgar Lin and Vice
Representative Shih Wen-pin also attended the seminar.
</P>
<P>
At the head of an official delegation, Lin flew to London from
New York on a tour to attract foreign investment in Taiwan's
state-run banks and enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corporation
and seven leading financial holdings companies, including Mega
Financial Holdings and Hua Nan Financial Holdings, make up the

SOUTH AFRICAN MINISTER SOLICITS TAIWANESE INVESTMENT

South African Trade and Industry
Minister Mandisi Mpahlwa on Monday called for Taiwanese
businesspeople around the world to use South Africa as a springboard
for making inroads into other parts of the continent.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the appeal while addressing an annual meeting
held by the board of directors and supervisors of the World Taiwanese
Chambers of Commerce in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
Since South Africa is the largest economy on the continent and
has a stable political and economic environment as well as good
economic relations with other countries, Taiwanese businesspeople can
use it to make inroads into other markets on the continent, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister expressed the hope that with economic growth of 4
percent last year and a healthy industrial sector that will
strengthen the country's competitiveness, South Africa can lure more
investment from Taiwan in the future.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, total annual Taiwan-South Africa trade
registered a vast increase from US$4.9 billion in 1994 to about US$9
billion in recent years. South Africa's main exports to Taiwan have
been metal products, while its major imports from the island have
been high-tech goods.

The Straits Times
: HDB gives developers a bigger role.

Home-buyers looking to buy a newly-
constructed Housing Board flat in Tampines in
the next year or two are set for a big surprise.

Instead of arranging the purchase with the
HDB, they will find themselves face-to-face 
with a private developer.

In a bold experiment, the Government
announced yesterday that it will allow private 
developers to design, build, price and sell 
some HDB flats in Tampines Avenue 6.

The Lianhe Zaobao: HDB to announce 3 new
measures.

The public housing sector is up for a
makeover, starting with a pilot plan to allow 
private developers to design, build and sell 
HDB flats.

National Development Minister Mah Bow Tan
also announced other changes in Parliament, 
like relaxation of rental rules to encourage 
residents to be more self-reliant.

'ANTI-SECESSION LAW' EXPOSES CHINA'S INTENT TO INVADE TAIWAN: MAC
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 8 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) lodged a
strong protest Tuesday at what it called China's attempt to use an
"anti-secession law" to unilaterally change the status quo across the
Taiwan Strait, saying the law has exposed Beijing's intent to take
over Taiwan by force.
</P>
<P>
The MAC issued the statement after China's National People's
Congress unveiled the key points of the draft law earlier in the day,
which include the use of "non-peaceful" means to check secessionist
activities in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"The government hereby expresses its strongest protest at the
vicious attempt and brutal means of China to sabotage peace in East
Asia and stability across the Taiwan Strait, ignore the will of the
Taiwan people, and interfere with the freedom of choice of the Taiwan
people," the MAC said.
</P>
<P>
The MAC said China is attempting to negate the sovereignty of the
Republic of China and to change the cross-strait status quo
unilaterally by introducing the law.
</P>
<P>
The move has cause regional tension, which proves that the
worries of the international community and Taiwan are not
unwarranted, according to the MAC.
</P>
<P>
It said the law has exposed China's ambition to take over Taiwan
by force and to build up regional dominance and has virtually given
the Chinese military the permission to attack Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The MAC pointed out that the Republic of China is a sovereign
state, with the two sides of the Taiwan Strait being independent of
each other.
</P>
<P>
"The people of Taiwan will never accept the arrangement of 'one
country, two systems' because the future of Taiwan must be decided by
the 23 million people on Taiwan, which is a fact that Chinese
authorities must face up to," the MAC said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the government has made many efforts to try to
improve cross-strait relations over the past five years, which
include putting forth a proposal to establish a framework for
cross-strait peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
The "anti-secession law" will impede cross-strait exchanges and
the resumption of cross-strait dialogue and disregard the efforts
made by Taiwan, it continued.
</P>
<P>
The MAC urged the international community to pay attention to the
hegemonic ambition of China and take concrete actions to help
maintain the cross-strait status quo and peace.

U.S. DOESN'T SUPPORT 'ANTI-SECESSION LAW': MOFA OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 8 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States's stance on China's plan
to enact a so-called "anti-secession law" targeting Taiwan is that
such legislation will not be beneficial to the situation across the
Taiwan Strait, an official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Victor J. Chin, director-general of the MOFA's Department of
North American Affairs, made the remarks after China's rubber-stamp
parliament -- the National People's Congress -- began to deliberate
on the law the same day.
</P>
<P>
ROC government officials have exchanged views with their U.S.
counterparts on Beijing's proposed "anti-secession law" since late
January and have explained the eventual impact of the new law on
stability and peace across the Taiwan Strait and in the Asia-Pacific
area to the U.S. government, Chin said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Chin noted that both the U.S. spokesman and other officials
have expressed their viewpoints on the legislation from different
angles, adding that Washington has said it is unnecessary for Beijing
to enact such a law.
</P>
<P>
According to Chin, the U.S. government doesn't support and is
even opposed to Beijing's move to unilaterally change the status quo
in the Taiwan Strait or to define future cross-strait situation.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan will continue to keep a close eye on developments of
the law by China's National People's Congress while maintaining close
contacts with the United States to safeguard regional peace
and stability.

PREMIER RULES OUT PRE-CONDITIONS FOR CROSS-STRAIT NEGOTIATIONS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Tuesday that
Beijing should not impose any prerequisites for reopening
negotiations between Taiwan and mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the remarks while answering questions from People
First Party Legislator Lee Ching-an in a legislative interpellation,
who enquired about the government's stance on the impending enactment
of Beijing's "anti-secession law," which observers say could be aimed
at curbing Taiwan independence. The lawmaker suggested the government
recognize the "1992 consensus" in its dealings with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh called on Beijing to put aside its sovereignty disputes
with Taiwan and forswear any other preconditions to display a greater
degree of goodwill for rekindling bilateral negotiations on the
grounds that the "bigger should compromise more."
</P>
<P>
Stressing that peace is the cornerstone of cross-Taiwan Strait
relations, he said that the government is willing to start two-way
talks on direct cargo services based on parity and dignity and even
those on direct trade, passenger transport and postal links based on
the pattern of the recent Taiwan-mainland charter flights during the
lunar new year holidays.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question from Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Su Chi
about whether President Chen Shui-bian's stated desire to write a new
constitution for Taiwan provokes Beijing, the premier said that what
matters is its contents.
</P>
<P>
Since what the president referred to focuses on a streamlining of
the legislative and executive branches and will not touch on the
nation's official designation or change his "five noes" policy, such
contents should not constitute a provocation to Beijing, he said.
</P>
<P>
While fielding questions from KMT Legislator John Chang on
opening regular links across the strait, he also vowed to strive for
Taiwan's co-existence with the mainland at a time when Beijing's
parliament is anticipated to finish the "anti-secession" legislation
next week. He pledged not to give up the goal no matter how difficult
the situation.

KMT OPPOSES CHINA'S ATTEMPT TO USE FORCE AGAINST TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  8 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers
objected Tuesday to China's proposed "anti-secession law," which will
authorize Beijing authorities to use force against Taiwan under
certain circumstances.
</P>
<P>
According to the key points of the draft law unveiled earlier in
the day by the National People's Congress of China, Beijing can take
"non-peaceful" action "in the event that the Taiwan independence
forces should act under any name or by any means to cause the fact of
Taiwan's secession from China."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the legislation, KMT legislative caucus whip Chen
Chieh asserted that the Republic of China is an independent,
sovereign state and will not tolerate any attempt by Beijing to
change or downgrade the status of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He also urged President Chen Shui-bian to avoid provoking China
and stop promoting a campaign to draft a new constitution and change
the official name of the country.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator Lin Yi-shih said it will be impossible for Taiwan
and China to start peace talks unless China renounces the use of
force against the island.
</P>
<P>
Although Beijing is aiming its military action at the
pro-independence movement, all people on Taiwan will get hurt should
any Chinese missile hit the island, Lin pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Lin urged Beijing to stop trying to resolve the problem of Taiwan
independence by force, because he said this will panic the Taiwan
people and hinder the resumption of cross-strait dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Shuai Hua-min, another KMT legislator, said all people on Taiwan,
regardless of their political affiliations, are opposed to China's
military intimidation of Taiwan.

<P>
Vice President Annette Lu called on the
international community Tuesday to condemn China's plan to enact a
so-called "anti-secession law" targeting Taiwan, claiming that such
legislation will unilaterally challenge and sabotage the status quo
in the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
China's rubber-stamp parliament -- the National People's Congress
-- on Tuesday began to deliberate the much-anticipated
"anti-secession law" that will probably provide its military with a
legal base for using force against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Resolving all disputes through peaceful talks is a fundamental
international practice in the 21st century, Lu said. She added that
any attempts to deal with disputes through non-peaceful means will
violate this international practice.
</P>
<P>
"China has expressed explicitly in its presentation of the draft
legislation that should Taiwan be reluctant to accept unification
with China or the "one China" policy, Beijing will resort to
non-peaceful means to solve the issue," Lu pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that such a move will infringe upon current
international practice, Lu said that Beijing's attempts to upset the
peace across the Taiwan Strait should be vehemently condemned and
blocked by the international community.

GOVERNMENT HELPING SME DEVELOPMENT: VICE ECONOMICS MINISTER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 8 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Republic of China government continues
to help small and medium enterprises (SMEs) develop, Vice Minister of
Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-long said Tuesday at an Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum meeting in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
The APEC Symposium on Industrial Clustering for SMEs is being
held at the Taipei International Convention Center. The conference is
part of a series of prelude meetings for the 2005 APEC SME
Ministerial Meeting, which will take place from Aug. 28 to Sept. 3 in
Daegu, South Korea.
</P>
<P>
In a keynote speech at the symposium, Chen introduced the
government's policy regarding industrial clustering.
</P>
<P>
The economist said industrial clusters have played a key role in
the island's successful economic development, citing the formation of
the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park.
</P>
<P>
Describing the facility in northern Taiwan as the best example of
industrial clustering, Chen noted that there are currently more than
300 companies operating in the park, creating a total output value of
US$25 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
Industrial clustering covers a broad range of economic
activities, which, beside business gatherings, include market and
technology information exchanges, Chen explained, adding that this
helps lower production and trading costs while ensuring more
efficient resource sharing.
</P>
<P>
Chen stressed that industrial clustering is an important strategy
for a country to boost economic development, while it also plays a
key role in SME development. Because of these reasons, the ROC
government will continue efforts to construct and develop
science-based industrial parks, help build a supply chain for local
SMEs, set up an SME contact network, and promote cooperative
relations between the industrial, official and academic sectors, he
said.

The Times: Credit card fraud hits new high
despite chip and PIN.

Credit and debit card fraud has soared to a record £500 million
despite the introduction of new chip-and-PIN technology, it emerged
today. Banks, credit card companies and shop owners hoped that the
new technology would reduce fraud because a four-digit personal
identification number is harder to reproduce than a signature. But
far from deterring fraudsters, the new measures have encouraged
criminals to steal more cards. Figures from Apacs (the Association
for Payment Clearing Services) show that losses to thieves rose by 20
per cent last year, equivalent to £10 for every adult in Britain. An
average of 100,000 credit and debit cards were posted to consumers
every day last year. Many were intercepted by criminals, resulting in
a 62 per cent rise -- to £73 million -- in "mail non-receipt" fraud.

ANTI-SECESSION LAW WILL NOT CAUSE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN: KMT OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Johannesburg,  March 7 (CNA)
(By C.C. Liu and Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An impending anti-secession law by
Beijing is not expected to spur an economic downturn in Taiwan, P. K.
Chiang, a vice chairman of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT), said
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chiang predicted that the law will not drag down foreign
investment in Taiwan or the operations of Taiwan and foreign
companies at home. He added that its impact on the political front
will depend on to what extent Taiwan reacts.
</P>
<P>
However, Chiang said he believes the enactment of the
anti-secession law will hinder Taiwan investment willingness in
mainland China, although he does not expect the law to trigger war
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
He contended that the effects of the proposed law will not cause
negative effects on the Taiwan economy any more than those of
Taiwan's own moves to create a new constitution or to change its
official designation of the Republic of China -- movements which have
proven to be provocative to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
As Taiwan has over the past few years been at loggerheads with
the mainland, a piece of legislation by Beijing in itself will not
aggravate the situation across the Taiwan Strait and further trigger
an economic dwindling in Taiwan, he claimed.
</P>
<P>
Chiang said the KMT will fully cooperate with other parties in
the legislation of a bill initiated by its ally the People First
Party with the aim of boosting cross-strait peace and he called on
the government to take substantive measures to serve that end.
</P>
<P>
Cross-strait peace and domestic political stability are the two
fundamentals upon which Taiwan's economic development rests, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the KMT vice chairman, the party is slated to send a
delegation late this month to China to help pave the way for
bilateral talks related to agriculture and direct cargo and passenger
flight services.
</P>
<P>
Chiang, formerly a chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development in the previous KMT-led government,
traveled to South Africa at the head of a legislative mission to take
part in a board meeting of the World Taiwanese Chamber of Commerce
held here earlier the same day.

TSU CALLS FOR 'DEFENSIVE REFERENDUM' TO COUNTER ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials of the pro-independence
opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) called on President Chen
Shui-bian Tuesday to initiate a "defensive referendum" to counteract
China's proposed anti-secession law against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
TSU Secretary-General Chen Chien-ming said the law, which will
authorize the Beijing authorities to use non-peaceful means to check
so-called "secessionist" activities in Taiwan, is evidence of China's
intention to change the status quo across the Taiwan Strait and
suppress Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that President Chen launch a "defensive referendum"
in accordance with the Referendum Law to exhibit the resolve of the
Taiwan people to defend the country's sovereignty and survival.
</P>
<P>
Lo Chih-ming, convener of the TSU legislative caucus, said the
party will propose a referendum to let the people vote on "whether
Taiwan is part of China" if the president does not exercise his
right.
</P>
<P>
Also, Lo said, the TSU will release Friday details of its
"anti-annexation law" in retaliation for the anti-secession
legislation that China is expected to pass next week.
</P>
<P>
According to Lo, Beijing's claim that Taiwan is part of China is
inconsistent with reality and the cross-strait status quo.
</P>
<P>
Lo said the China-proposed "one country, two systems" format for
unification is unacceptable to the people of Taiwan, because any
changes to the status quo must be decided by the people of Taiwan
through a democratic process.
</P>
<P>
The anti-secession law is tantamount to a license for the
People's Liberation Army to attack Taiwan and a measure coercing the
Taiwan people to accept China's annexation, according to Lo.

"As I look back over the last four years, engaging China and
handling its peaceful rise is inevitably the top priority, " Kelly
said.
</P>
<P>
There will be no profound changes in President George Bush's
foreign policy in his second term, given that many policy aspects
worked reasonably well in Bush's first administration, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Also, he went on, both Bush and Secretary of State Condeleezza
Rice have been intimately involved in every important component of
East Asia-Pacific policy over the last several years, while Deputy
Secretary of State Robert Zoellick has both affinity for and
first-hand experience in Asian political questions as well as the
economic issues.
</P>
<P>
Although there has been an increasing number of issues on which
Washington and Beijing cooperate very well, Kelly admitted there are
a number of issues over which the two sides have strong
disagreements, such as human rights and protection of intellectual
property rights.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China has changed a lot over the last decade, Kelly
said the economic growth and improvements in the lives of many
Chinese and a rising nationalism shape Beijing's current thinking.
</P>
<P>
With regard to where China is headed, he said some believe China
is headed for a bad end, while others are optimistic given China's
movement toward becoming a global power.
</P>
<P>
There are conflicting possibilities and the United States must be
mindful of all of them, he said.

TAIWAN-NICARAGUA FTA TALKS TO BE COMPLETED IN APRIL: OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   March  8  (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan-Nicaragua consultations on a
proposed free trade agreement (FTA) are expected to be completed in
April this year at the earliest, an official of the Ministry of
Finance (MOF) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chien Liang-chi, director of the MOF's Department of Customs
Administration, said that Taiwan and Nicaragua have so far conducted
three rounds of bilateral FTA talks and that both parties have
reached consensus on several issues, such as anti-dumping duties and
countervailing duties.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua has expressed its satisfaction with a Taiwan-produced
list of Nicaraguan farm and industrial products that will be allowed
in, according to Chien.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that the Nicaraguan government still has
different opinions concerning tariff concessions on several kinds of
products. He added that regulations on countries of origin have yet
to be discussed.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Chien said, the two sides agreed to hold a fourth
round of consultations in the Nicaraguan capital of Managua April 18-
22, in the hope that the two countries will complete their bilateral
consultation talks and enter a formal FTA in the first half of this
year. If everything goes smoothly, Nicaragua is expected to become
Taiwan's second FTA partner after Panama.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chien disclosed that the first round of
Taiwan-Guatemala FTA negotiations have also been completed and that a
second round of talks is scheduled to be held April 11.
</P>
<P>
Noting that signing a FTA will be beneficial to economic and
trade exchanges between the two signatory countries, Chien said that
since the FTA signed between Taiwan and Panama came into force Jan. 1
last year, Taiwan's exports to Panama grew by around 100 percent in
2004, while imports from Panama posted a phenomenal growth of 200
percent.

DPP DELIVERS BROADSIDE AGAINST CHINA'S ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   March  8  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The leaders of ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) lambasted China's anti-secession law Tuesday
as Beijing's National People's Congress (NPC) was set to pass it, but
have not decided whether to organize a large-scale demonstration to
protest against it.
</P>
<P>
The DPP Central Standing Committee professed in a resolution its
firm objection to the law, calling it a war-mandating bill that will
disrupt the stability across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
The resolution urges China to refrain from enacting the law,
saying NPC discussion of the law has already stirred up Taiwan
people's opposition and indignation. As the ruling party of Taiwan,
the DPP will not sit idly by when Taiwan's status is changed by China
unilaterally, the foundation of Taiwan's democracy is undermined, and
the fundamental interests of Taiwan are hurt.
</P>
<P>
DPP Secretary-General Lee Yi-yang said the anti-secession law is
a regressive act that provides China with an excuse to invade Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He said his party wants to develop a peaceful framework with
China to ensure long-term peace across the Taiwan Strait, but China
should refrain from hurting the feelings of the Taiwan people and
stop disrupting the peace and stability between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The DPP secretary-general refused to say whether his party will
greet the enactment of the law with a large-scale demonstration,
saying that it depends on the text of the law, which has not yet made
public.
</P>
<P>
The DPP has vowed to stage a mass demonstration in three
scenarios -- if the anti-secession law imposes penalties on Taiwan
people, or leads to changes to the status quo across the strait, or
damages Taiwan's basic national interests.
</P>
<P>
In a related development Tuesday, DPP Legislator Lai Chin-teh,
the whip of DPP caucus at the Legislative Yuan, said his caucus would
support whatever responses are taken by the DPP leadership and
administration, such as amending the Constitution or staging a
protest.
</P>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh suggested earlier in the day deleting the
General Provisions of the Constitution which provide for the
country's official name as the Republic of China should the
anti-secession law mandate China to invade Taiwan with force at
whatever time it wishes.
</P>
<P>
Lai said the people of Taiwan will certainly support the
premier's suggestion if the scenario he described takes place.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that China's attempt to enact the law has destabilized
the peace in the region, Lai called on the United States and the
European Union to weigh in and mediate the disputes between Taiwan
and China.
</P>
<P>
Yen Wan-chin, DPP deputy secretary-general, said the law gives
China the option for taking over Taiwan by "non-peaceful means" under
certain situations and pointed out that "non-peaceful means" is a
euphemism for "use of force."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the law is nothing but a war-mandating law, Yen said,
adding that some political parties still claim the law is aimed at
pro-independence activists in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He urged these parties to forge a common front with the DPP in
facing up to China.
</P>
<P>
Yen said his party would like to encourage exchanges with China,
including the start of direct transportation links across the strait,
but added that the party has the responsibility to warn local people
that Beijing has not given up its designs against Taiwan, a point
they should keep in mind when dealing with China.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Chen Ching-chun, who is the secretary of the DPP
caucus at the legislature, criticized China for turning a blind eye
to the fact that Taiwan has been a separate state from China for a
long time.
</P>
<P>
The anti-secession law has shown China's failure to realize the
political reality and has underlined its aggressive characteristics,
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the DPP will not accept China's shameless assumption
that it has the right to determine Taiwan's future and will never
waver in its determination to defend the sovereignty of Taiwan.

PFP CHAIRMAN URGES TAIWAN, CHINA TO HANDLE TIES  CALMLY

<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong urged Taiwan and China Tuesday to deal with
cross-Taiwan Strait affairs with calm and reason to avoid a
miscalculation and to facilitate reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Soong made the remarks in response to China's proposed
anti-secession law, which will authorize the Beijing authorities to
use non-peaceful means to check what it describes as "secessionist"
activities on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The National People's Congress of China is expected to pass the
law next week.
</P>
<P>
Soong pointed out that the cross-strait deadlock has resulted
from the different choices made by Taiwan and China in terms of their
economic and political systems, which he said is neither an ethnic
problem nor a conflict between two countries.
</P>
<P>
Soong said that promoting the establishment of a Taiwanese
identity is not equal to pushing for independence and that Beijing
should respect the desire of the Taiwan people to be their own
masters.
</P>
<P>
According to Soong, maintaining peace and the status quo should
be the guiding principle in dealing with cross-strait relations
because any unilateral move to change the cross-strait status quo
will be unacceptable to the international community and to the people
on both sides of the Strait.
</P>
<P>
He called Beijing's attention to what he said is a change in
Taiwan's political situation after a meeting between himself and
President Chen Shui-bian two weeks ago, in which Chen promised he
will not change the official name of the country or draft a new
constitution during his term.

WIDOW OF ALLEGED '319' SHOOTER APOLOGIZES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The widow of a man who police believe shot
and slightly wounded President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President
Annette Lu March 19, 2004 apologized Tuesday for her late husband's
actions.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on a videotape shown by the Criminal Investigation
Bureau (CIB) , the widow of Chen Yi-hsiung said her husband had
admitted firing the shots on the eve of the 2004 presidential
election, which were widely claimed to have swung the vote in
President Chen's favor.
</P>
<P>
"Concerning the shooting of President Chen, he (my husband) had
taken responsibility, " said the woman, who kept her back to the
camera. "I am deeply sorry for (the event's) causing harm to society.
I apologize to the public and hope the whole thing will end here."
</P>
<P>
Chen Yi-hsiung, 63, was found dead in Anping harbor in the
southern Taiwan city of Tainan March 29 last year -- 10 days after
the shooting -- in what police have said was an apparent suicide.
</P>
<P>
His widow's videotaped apology came a day after police identified
Chen Yi-hsiung as the key suspect in the shooting.
</P>
<P>
CIB Commissioner Hou Yu-ih, a key member of a special task force
probing the shooting, said after showing the videotape at a news
conference that he hopes the public will adopt a lenient and
forgiving attitude toward Chen Yi-hsiung's bereaved family.
</P>
<P>
According to Hou, Chen Yi-hsiung's family members were "innocent
third parties."
</P>
<P>
"It was understandable and forgivable that his family was
reluctant to cooperate in the initial stage of the investigation, but
they have finally come to the decision to face up to reality and make
an apology for their loved one's action. I hope the public can also
rationally face up to the reality and show leniency to Chen's
bereaved family to avoid adding up to divisions and confrontation in
society," Hou said.
</P>
<P>
President Chen and Lu were slightly wounded March 19, 2004 when
two homemade bullets grazed them as they campaigned in an open-topped
jeep in Tainan. After the Chen-Lu ticket narrowly won re-election the
following day, the sole challenging ticket of Kuomintang Chairman
Lien Chan and People First Party Chairman James Soong accused the
president of having staged the shooting to win sympathy votes and
filed two lawsuits to challenge the election result. The shooting is
believed to have gravely aggravated hostility between the ruling and
opposition camps.
</P>
<P>
Hou said the police have devoted enormous amounts of manpower and
energy to finally track down Chen Yi-hsiung.
</P>
<P>
"Throughout the investigation, the team has strictly followed Dr.
Henry Lee's directive to track the gunman by tracing the flow of
bullets and the gun used in the shooting, " Hou said, adding that the
renowned Chinese-American forensic expert has contributed a great
deal to the investigation with his comprehensive forensic report on
the evidence collected at the crime scene.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the breakthrough in the investigation was the
hard-won result of concerted efforts of all team members, Hou said
the breakthrough was not achieved with information provided by any
private informer.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, there will be no problem of who is eligible to claim
the NT$53 million reward offered by the government for providers of
useful clues to uncover the key suspect," Hou said.
</P>
<P>
According to Hou, the investigative team targeted Chen Yi-
hsiung's family for intensive monitoring and repeat visits for at
least four months.
</P>
<P>
"It was no easy task to 'break their psychological defense,'" he
said.
</P>
<P>
"After we came to learn through wiretapping that they were
preparing to destroy certain evidence, we decided to separately
interrogate each family member. Through such isolated interrogation,
we secured a major breakthrough last weekend. The family members
underwent lie detection Sunday," Hou added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kuo Chen-ni, a chief prosecutor responsible for the
case, said that Chen Yi-hsiung's son, daughter-in-law and youngest
daughter have all been listed as defendants because they claim to
have burned their father's suicide notes and other evidence.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Kuo said the trio may not necessarily be indicted
because the Criminal Code exempts family members from the duty of
reporting their loved ones' criminal activities. She said the family
has been subject to maximum-guard protection by the investigative
team and he urged the public and the media to refrain from harassing
them.
</P>
<P>
Kuo further said the investigative team has targeted several
places for an intensified search of the homemade pistol believed to
be used in the shooting. She said Chen Yi-hsiung bought agun from an
underground gunsmith through his brother-in-law. Kuo stressed that
many witnesses have proved that Chen Yi-hsiung bought the gun prior
to last March, but she would not reveal further details.
</P>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said earlier in the day that the CIB report a
day earlier on the major breakthrough does not mark an end to the
investigation of the case.
</P>
<P>
"I personally sanctioned the report with a view to preventing the
spread of rumors. After the key suspect's family confessed to his
criminal action, the media would very quickly gain information. If
the CIB failed to give an authoritative first-hand report, rumors
would fly in our free-wheeling pluralistic society," Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
The premier, a lawyer-turned-politician, said the investigative
team must continue its probe into the whereabouts of the handgun used
in the shooting and other evidence to back up its "breakthrough"
report.

PRESIDENT MEETS WITH NSC TO COPE WITH ANTI-SECESSION LAW

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian has met with the
National Security Council to cope with China's plan to enact an
anti-secession law targeting Taiwan, Premier Frank Hsieh said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh told lawmakers during a legislative interpellation session
that the president will make a final decision as to what steps the
government will adopt in reaction to the legislation.
</P>
<P>
According to the key points of the draft law unveiled by the
National People's Congress of China earlier in the day, the law will
authorize the Beijing authorities to use non-peaceful means to check
what they call "secessionist" activities on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said Chen will still follow his "five noes" commitment
regarding national status after the passage of the law by China.
</P>
<P>
The "five noes" refers to Chen's promise that if Beijing has no
intention of using force against Taiwan, he will not declare
independence, will not change the official name of the country, will
not include the "state-to-state" theory in the Constitution, will not
promote a referendum on independence or unification to change the
cross-strait status quo and will not abolish the Guidelines for
National Unification and the National Unification Council.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said the government will not make any pro-active moves to
amend the Constitution to counter the anti-secession law, but said he
supports efforts by the people to change the Constitution based on a
national consensus.
</P>
<P>
As to whether Taiwan and China will still remain in a state of
peace after the enactment of the anti-secession law, Hsieh said the
Cabinet will respect Chen's interpretation of the issue.

BEIJING URGED TO PONDER PEOPLE'S WELFARE WHILE ENACTING NEW LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 8 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leaders of several domestic industrial and
business organizations voiced the hope Tuesday that China will take
into consideration the long-term welfare of China and Taiwan
residents when dealing with the anti-secession law targeting the
island.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan government should also seek to hold negotiations with
the Beijing authorities so as to turn the crisis into a good
opportunity to safeguard the rights and interests of the people of
Taiwan, they said.
</P>
<P>
Wang Tiao-chun, secretary-general of the Council for Industrial
and Commercial Development, and Chen Cheng-yi, spokesman for the
General Chamber of Commerce of the Republic of China, made the
appeals after China unveiled key points of the much-anticipated
anti-secession law, including authorizing the State Council and the
Central Military Commission to take "non-peaceful" action against
Taiwan in certain situations.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who has been trying to act as a communication bridge
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait and was also one of the
promoters of the special direct cross-strait chartered flights
launched during the Lunar New Year holiday, said that the proposed
anti-secession law will certainly be passed by China's rubber-stamp
National People's Congress (NPC) due to strong pressure from
Beijing's diehard lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
However, Wang said the Beijing authorities have "softened" the
wording of the new law to make a concession to Taiwan. For instance,
"non-peaceful means" is used as a substitute for "use of force," Wang
noted, adding that according to Beijing's presentation on the draft
legislation, should China be forced to take military action against
Taiwan, its military will do everything possible to protect the
personal safety of the people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Terming the planned anti-secession law as a stick in a
carrot-and-stick approach adopted by the Beijing leadership, Wang
said the government should seriously ponder what Taiwan needs at the
moment, such as the island's presence in the international arena, and
then seek to hold talks with Beijing on such issues.
</P>
<P>
Sharing Wang's viewpoints, Chen said that although the passage of
the anti-secession law will not be blocked, the Beijing leadership
should refrain from showing its hostility toward the people of Taiwan
so that their feelings are not hurt.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that China postpone promulgating the anti-secession
law or make it a political statement, which he said would make the
people of Taiwan more confident of "China's goodwill" toward the
island.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhaoguo, a vice chairman of the NPC's Standing Committee
unveiled the highlights of the controversial draft law in a report at
the parliament's ongoing plenary session.
</P>
<P>
Wang said peaceful unification and the "one country, two systems"
scheme are Beijing's basic approaches to achieving "peaceful
reunification." However, he also stressed that China considers itself
entitled to use force to check secessionist activities on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"Using non-peaceful means to stop secession in defence of our
sovereignty and territorial integrity would be a last resort for us,
after all our efforts for a peaceful reunification proved futile, "
Wang told mainland lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
He said the draft legislation, which is expected to be passed
next week, provides for the use of force "in the event that the
Taiwan independence forces should act under any name or by any means
to cause the fact of Taiwan's secession from China."
</P>
<P>
Beijing has yet to publicize the full text of the so-called
anti-secession law targeting Taiwan.

exports.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan pavilion will hold a series of activities during the
exhibition, including the introduction of new products and
taste-testing, to promote Taiwan's quality products based on health,
safety and tastiness, he added.

PRESIDENT MAKES CASE FOR TAIWAN'S SOVEREIGNTY TO AUSTRALIA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Sydney,  March 8 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
made a strong case for Taiwan's sovereignty in a television interview
with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In the 25-minute interview, Chen stressed that his country is a
sovereign state that has never been ruled by the People's Republic of
China (PRC) , therefore the PRC's claim that Taiwan is one of its
provinces is groundless. The international community should not let
Beijing take over the island and rob Taiwanese of their hard-earned
freedom, democracy and rights, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president reiterated a promise he made in his 2000 inaugural
address that he will not flirt with the idea of Taiwan independence
during his term and stressed that he will refrain from declaring
Taiwan independence as long as China refrains from invading Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He expressed regret that Australian Foreign Minister Alexander
Downer ruled out the possibility in Beijing last August that his
country would help the United States to defend Taiwan in line with a
treaty between Sydney and Washington.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the Taiwan issue is more than an issue of just Taiwan
but is also an issue of the Asia-Pacific region and an issue of the
entire world. If Taiwan, which is a strategic hub in the region, were
to be annexed by China, the security of all the states in the region
would be threatened, he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged Australia, as well as the United States and New Zealand,
to have some empathy with Taiwan and to prevent the island from
becoming an "orphan in international society."
</P>
<P>
In order to conduct the interview, an ABC TV crew flew to Palau
and the Solomon Islands to meet with Chen when he visited those two
South Pacific allies between Jan. 27-31. They caught glimpses of his
trip there and accompanied him on his way back to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
They also followed the president during his return to his Tainan
home Feb. 9 for Chinese New Year and filmed him worshipping his
ancestors, giving out red envelopes to his fellow townsmen, and
chatting with the elderly.

The Cabinet-level Department of Health
(DOH) confirmed Tuesday that consuming U.S. beef is safe and that it

The Executive Yuan will decide if U.S. beef will be allowed to
re-enter the Taiwan market after it receives the report, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan suspended beef imports from the United States in December

SCHOLARS SEE FEW NEW IDEAS IN CHINA'S ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 8 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The anti-secession law to be enacted by
China is more a declaration than a law with legal effect, Chang
Wu-yueh, a professor of the Chinese Study Center at Tamkang
University in Tanshui, Taipei County, claimed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The law is a document combining the current China policy toward
Taiwan, mainly the eight-point guidelines spelled out by former
Chinese President Jiang Zemin in 1995 and the four-point guidelines
drawn up by Chinese President Hu Jintao March 4.
</P>
<P>
However, the disputes between Taiwan and China cannot be settled
unilaterally and the prospects that China can settle them through a
domestic law are slim, Chang said.
</P>
<P>
He disputed some local politicians' claims that the
"non-peaceful" phrase used in the law means "military force," arguing
that there are non-peaceful means short of the use of force, such as
economic sanctions and psychological warfare.
</P>
<P>
In view of the great concern the bill has raised among Taiwan
people, Chang urged Beijing not have recourse to the law to avoid
alienating the Taiwan people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Huang Chieh-cheng, another professor from Tamkang
University, said the law is harsher than expected and has ignored
Taiwan public opinion. The Taiwan authorities should respond solemnly
rather than with emotional criticism, he said.

good sense for one single day, the world would become moral. To be
moral, a man depends entirely upon himself and not upon others."

U.S. OPPOSES NON-PEACEFUL MEANS ON TAIWAN ISSUE: BOUCHER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,   March  8  (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Commenting on China's proposed
anti-secession law, a U.S. State Department spokesman said Tuesday
that the United States has always opposed any attempt to determine
the future of Taiwan by non-peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
Although the full text of the anti-secession law targeting Taiwan
has not actually been released, Wang Zhaoguo, a deputy chairman of
the Chinese National People's Congress Standing Committee, described
the keys points of the law Tuesday to the nearly 3,000 NPC members
gathered at the Great Hall of the People. The law includes the
authorization of non-peaceful actions to resolve the Taiwan issue in
certain situations.
</P>
<P>
When asked about this point, U.S. State Department spokesman
Richard Boucher quoted a journalist as noting that the anti-secession
law calls for non-peaceful means possibly to be directed at Taiwan.
"We have always opposed any attempt to determine the future of Taiwan
by other than peaceful means," Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
"We've talked about this with people in the PRC as well as people
on Taiwan. We've had continuing discussions with both sides and we
expect that dialogue and discussion will continue," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he also said that the anti-secession legislation issue
had not come up when Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice talked with
her Chinese counterpart, Li Zhaoxing, over telephone the day before.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether Rice will raise the issue during her meetings
with Chinese leaders when she visits Beijing next week, Boucher said
that "if eventually I confirm that she's going to make a trip and
that China might be part of that trip, then I would expect her to
discuss the Taiwan questions in Beijing."
</P>
<P>
In a written statement issued Tuesday evening, the State
Department said that Rice and other members of the U.S.
administration have expressed concern to Chinese officials that the
anti-secession law "may be counterproductive and is not helpful in
the current environment, where there are opportunities for exchanges
that could move forward a peaceful resolution of outstanding
cross-strait differences."

U.S. PACIFIC COMMANDER CALLS ANTI-SECESSION LAW 'DISCONCERTING'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China's proposed anti-secession
legislation is disconcerting, the commander of the U.S. Pacific
Command said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Adm. William Fallon, who assumed his post in late February, made
the remarks at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing during which
he was asked to give his general evaluation of Beijing's so-called
anti-secession law and the U.S. aircraft carrier deployment in the
West Pacific in light of this new development.
</P>
<P>
"It's disconcerting that this legislation has been put forward,
because I think it hardens the line, and it apparently gives them a
legal basis of sorts for the potential for military action later on,"
the admiral said.
</P>
<P>
Fallon added that he doesn't think the new legislation would be
useful in lessening tensions between Taiwan and China.
</P>
<P>
As to U.S. capabilities in the West Pacific, Fallon said the
presence of a carrier strike group in the Far East certainly has been
very useful in the past for a number of events.
</P>
<P>
"This ready capability forward-deployed, I think, is a very good
idea, particularly given the vast distances across the Pacific, " he
said, adding that "having this much robust power forward-deployed
gives us a lot of options for quick response."
</P>
<P>
"And some of it is certainly to deter potential military actions,
but there are other times when it comes in very handy, like the
tsunami relief effort, when we happened to have another carrier out
there that was nearby and could divert down there and work the
issue," Fallon said.
</P>
<P>
The National People's Congress -- China's rubber-stamp parliament
-- began to screen the so-called anti-secession bill Tuesday and is
expected to pass it next week.

NEARLY 80 PERCENT OF SCHOOLCHILDREN ARE HAPPY: POLL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 9 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over three-quarters of schoolchildren in
Taiwan are happy, according to a poll by the monthly magazine Power.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted on Grade 5 and 6 students in 41 elementary
schools around Taiwan, found that 78.5 percent of the schoolchildren
respondents said they feel happy. A total of 2,019 valid samples were
collected in the survey.
</P>
<P>
By region, central Taiwan showed the highest percentage of happy
children, at 80.2 percent, while northern Taiwan had the lowest, at
75 percent.
</P>
<P>
Some of the reasons cited by the schoolchildren for their
happiness included having a warm family and good friends, and not
having to worry about food or clothing. The survey found that
performance on school exams and pocket money were not factors
determining a child's level of happiness.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that only 41 percent of schoolchildren feel
that they will be even happier in the future. Interpreting this
result, Chai Sung-lin, a national policy adviser to President Chen
Shui-bian, and Tsai Wen-tze, a psychiatrist at National Taiwan
University Hospital, said it reflects the feeling of uncertainty
among schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the survey also showed that 88.8 percent of the
schoolchildren respondents are happy to go to school. Among those who
said they are not happy going to school, 58.7 percent cited a heavy
school workload as the reason, while 23 percent mentioned punishment
by school teachers or feelings of boredom. Chai said this shows that
education institutions still have room to improve.

SENIOR CITIZENS ACCOUNT FOR 9% OF TAIWAN'S TOTAL POPULATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Senior citizens made up 9 percent of
Taiwan's overall population in 2004, higher than the global average
of 7 percent, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan ranked third in Asia in terms of the ratio of senior
citizens to total population, trailing only Japan, at 19 percent, and
Hong Kong, at 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 2004, DGBAS officials said, the global aging index, calculated
by dividing the number of people aged 65 or over by the number of
people aged below 14, stood at 23.3. A higher index indicates a
greyer population.
</P>
<P>
By continent, North America had the highest aging index, at 57.1,
while Africa had the lowest, at 7.1. Asia's average index was 20,
with Japan's standing at an whopping 135.7.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan became an aging society as defined by the United Nations
in 1993 when the ratio of the country's senior citizens reached 7
percent of the total population for the first time. Over the past
decade, DGBAS officials said, Taiwan's population has been greying at
a rapid pace, with the aging index rising from 28.2 in 1993 to 45 in
2004.
</P>
<P>
In terms of life expectancy, North American people topped the
list in 2004, with an average life span of 78 years, while Africans
had the lowest life expectancy, at 52 years.
</P>
<P>
Asia's average life expectancy was 67 years in 2004, while
Taiwan's was 76 years, or the same level as in 2003.

SPEAKER OPPOSES MEMBERSHIP FEE REQUIREMENT FOR KMT CHAIRMAN ELECTION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 9 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legislative Yuan speaker Wang Jin-pyng, who
serves as a vice chairman of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT), voiced
opposition Wednesday to a party rule requiring members to pay
membership fees to gain the right to vote in the chairmanship
election.
</P>
<P>
Raising the issue at the party's weekly Central Standing
Committee meeting, Wang said a majority of KMT members will not be
able to participate in the election because of this requirement.
</P>
<P>
While the KMT has more than one million members, only about
200,000 to 300,000 members, most of whom are elderly, will determine
the outcome of the election because of the membership fee
requirement, Wang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the KMT must study whether the membership fee
requirement is in violation of legal principles and, if it is found
to be so, amend the rule.
</P>
<P>
Wang claimed that the membership fee requirement stipulated in
the existing rules governing the chairmanship election is against the
party charter which states that party chairman should be elected by
all rank-and-file members.
</P>
<P>
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, another KMT vice chairman, said he
supports any rules that are fair, reasonable and open.
</P>
<P>
Ma has announced his bid to run in the next chairmanship election
set for May, and Wang is also expected to announce his decision to
run for the post soon.
</P>
<P>
The KMT had originally planned to pass its schedule for the
election during the meeting. However, the item was not included in
the agenda owing to the dispute over the membership fee issue.
</P>
<P>
Liao Feng-teh, head of the KMT's Organization and Development
Committee, said the chairmanship election is being held according to
established rules and that amendments will be required if party
members disagree with any of these rules.

DPP UNWAVERING ON OPPOSITION TO ANTI-SECESSION LAW: PARTY WHIP
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 9 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China's war-mandating anti-secession law is
a heartless piece of legislation that completely disregards the fact
that Taiwan is a sovereign state, the whip of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party at the Legislative Yuan said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Lai Ching-teh, head of the DPP legislative caucus,
said that the DPP lawmakers are unwaveringly determined to defend the
sovereignty of Taiwan and will fight to the last ditch against the
law that gives China the option for taking over Taiwan by
"non-peaceful means."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference held at the Legislative Yuan, Lai
quoted former Chinese President Jiang Zemin as saying to the CPC
Central Military Commission when he resigned from his post as the
head of China's military Tuesday that "the military should prepare
itself to take over Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
"This indicates explicitly that Beijing has been playing a
two-handed game -- claiming attempts to push for peaceful unification
with Taiwan while enacting a law to give it an excuse to invade
Taiwan -- to fool the people of Taiwan," Lai claimed.
</P>
<P>
Lai said that prior to Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait, the
former Iraqi president also had a law enacted that claimed that "the
Kuwaiti people were looking forward to Iraqi rule of Kuwait."
</P>
<P>
Describing China's legislation as no different from the Iraqi
model, Lai called for the Chinese leaders Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao
not to follow Saddam's path, which will eventually lead the two sides
to doomsday.
</P>
<P>
Lai also called for party leaders from across Taiwan's political
spectrum to meet for a summit soon to jointly craft Taiwan's
countermeasures against the anti-secession law.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kuo Chun-ming, a deputy DPP party whip at the
Legislative Yuan, noted that Beijing kept the "sack" wide open before
Hong Kong was returned to China, but tightened the opening gradually
after Hong Kong's handover in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Kuo urged the people of Taiwan to view Hong Kong's situation
today, particularly its increasingly depleting democracy, and take
the Hong Kong example as a lesson.
</P>
<P>
Kuo also urged opposition parties to throw their support behind
the government in its arms procurement plan, saying that only by
beefing up Taiwan's defense capability can the island talk to Beijing
from a position of strength.

EDUCATION MINISTER OPPOSES CHINA'S ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Minister of Education Tu Cheng-sheng
expressed opposition Wednesday to China's enactment of an
anti-secession law, although he added that it is more appropriate for
heads of other relevant government agencies to make remarks in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
Tu made the remarks at a Legislative Yuan session after
opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) Legislator Lo Chih-ming
pressed Tu for an answer on his position regarding Beijing's
legislation of the anti-secession law.
</P>
<P>
Lo said that while the Ministry of Education (MOE) is teaching
Taiwan's next generation that the Republic of China is a sovereign
state, Beijing is enacting a law stipulating that Taiwan is a part of
China, which will not compromise on threats to its territorial
integration.
</P>
<P>
Lo demanded that Tu teach Taiwan's youth that Taiwan is not a
part of China.
</P>
<P>
In response, Tu said the MOE will enhance teaching about the
country and further nurture patriotism in students so that they can
then make their own judgments about themselves and the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the education minister said that the ministry's policy
of subsidizing the education of children of Taiwanese businessmen
operating in China -- known in Taiwan as "Taishang" -- will continue.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taishang children are also the children of Taiwan, Tu
said that if the government does not exert any influence on Taishang
children, they will end up receiving Chinese education and being fed
Chinese ideology.
</P>
<P>
Tu continued that the MOE is also planning to allow Taishang
children to attend schools ranging from elementary schools to
technology institutes in the ROC-held outlying islands of Kinmen and
Matsu.
</P>
<P>
Tu made the remarks in response to questions raised by TSU
Legislator Tseng Tsan-deng, who accused the MOE of inappropriately
spending too much money on Taishang childrens' education.
</P>
<P>
It is unfair that the government should foot the bill of about
NT$30,000 for each Taishang child each year while the Taishang pay no
taxes in Taiwan under the current taxation laws, Tseng pointed out.

KMT OPPOSES BEIJING USE OF FORCE AGAINST TAIWAN: PARTY CHAIRMAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 9 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) strongly
opposes Beijing's use of force against Taiwan and will do its utmost
to secure the welfare of the Taiwan people by upholding the Republic
of China Constitution, KMT spokesman Cheng Lee-wen said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Cheng was quoting remarks made by KMT Chairman Lien Chan in the
weekly meeting of the party's policy-deciding Central Standing
Committee.
</P>
<P>
According to Cheng, Lien said that the KMT is opposed to
Beijing's threats to launch military action to resolve its disputes
with Taiwan and he claimed that Taiwan independence is unnecessary.
Lien vowed to protect the benefits and interests of the people on
both sides of the Taiwan Strait under the framework of the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Regarding Beijing's ongoing legislation of an anti-secession law
apparently aimed at curbing Taiwan independence, Lien was cited as
saying that pro-Taiwan independence activists represent only a small
number of people in Taiwan society.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan-centric concept is very important but it is not
tantamount to Taiwan independence, Lien said, urging Beijing to
adequately deal with the ROC and its people.
</P>
<P>
To safeguard Taiwan, the KMT will not yield to any pro-Taiwan
independence movements, such as "one country on either side of the
strait, " the "two-state theory, " "writing a new constitution" or
"holding a referendum on Taiwan's future" and the "one country, two
systems" formula, he noted, insisting that the ROC is an independent

</P>
<P>
Under the prerequisite that the cross-strait status quo remains
intact, the KMT fervently hopes that Taiwan and China will re-open
stalled negotiations as soon as possible to step up bilateral
exchanges and avoid confrontation in any form, he said.
</P>
<P>
The KMT is Taiwan's leading opposition party, controlling 79
seats in the 225-member Legislative Yuan, behind only the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party, which has 89 seats.

CEC HEAD DOES NOT EXCLUDE POSSIBILITY OF REFERENDUM ON BEIJING LAW

<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 9 (CNA)

<TEXT>
<P>
Central Election Commission (CEC) Chairman
Chang Cheng-hsiung said Wednesday that he does not exclude the
possibility of Taiwan holding a nationwide referendum to say "no" to
Beijing's anti-secession law legislation.
</P>
<P>
Chang said it is possible that a nationwide referendum opposing
China's anti-secession law could be held simultaneously with the
elections for the mission-oriented National Assembly (NA) if an
endorsement on the referendum initiative is completed 40 days ahead
of the NA elections.
</P>
<P>
The CEC has set May 14 as the polling day for the National
Assembly election.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the CEC has no right to initiate a referendum, Chang
said, however, that it would be relatively difficult for the 23
million people of Taiwan to call for a referendum 40 days ahead of
May 14 and noted that it would be easier if the Legislative Yuan or
President Chen Shui-bian were to take the initiative to start a
nationwide referendum.

OPPOSITION URGED TO MAINTAIN REASON DESPITE DOUBTS OVER 319 SHOOTING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 9 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh urged the opposition
Wednesday to avoid resorting to irrational methods to express their
doubts over the investigations into last year's presidential
election-eve shooting of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President
Annette Lu.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the remarks during a Cabinet meeting after a "major
breakthrough" recently reported by the police on their investigations
into the shooting of March 19, 2004 that left Chen and Lu slightly
injured was dismissed by the Kuomintang (KMT) -led opposition as
totally implausible.
</P>
<P>
Police said Monday they had identified a man found drowned in a
suspected suicide last year as the alleged shooter by tracing clues
left by the two home-made bullets used in the shooting, although the
gun has yet to be found. The man was said to be an opposition
supporter who allegedly committed the shooting to vent his resentment
at Chen's administration.
</P>
<P>
The KMT, which believes the shooting was set up by the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party to give it an advantage in the election,
is planning to mobilize 100,000 people in a rally in front of the
Presidential Office on the anniversary of the shooting next Saturday
to press for the "truth."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the KMT's move, Hsieh said taking to the streets
will not help resolve the problem because the pursuit of truth should
be based on mutual trust.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh promised that the government will continue its
investigations into the shooting to answer the many doubts raised by
the public.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the shooting has polarized Taiwan society
into two camps that believe two extremely different stories and that
many people, including the president, vice president, medical workers
and security officials, have been hurt in the face of the disbelief
and doubts.
</P>
<P>
Under these circumstances, people tend to reject facts and
evidence that are inconsistent with their beliefs, Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said he agrees with Chinese-American forensic expert Henry
Lee, who called the breakthrough "extraordinary" in light of the lack
of direct evidence in the case.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said he has requested the police to improve their
investigation skills and continue to track down the gun and
investigate the cause of the suspect's death.
</P>
<P>
If necessary, the police can seek the assistance of international
experts, he added.
</P>
<P>
The premier said he understands that finding the truth behind the
319 shooting is the common expectation of the people, even though
they may have differing interpretations of the case.
</P>
<P>
He urged political parties and their leaders to help build up a
trustful and rational society that values evidence and facts.

PRESIDENT WILL NOT ACCEPT VIOLENT MEANS TO VENT DISCONTENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 9 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President
Annette Lu are willing to accept criticism and suggestions, but they
cannot accept anyone using violent means to vent their
dissatisfaction, a spokesman for the Presidential Office said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Wen-chung, director of the Department of Public Affairs of
the Presidential Office, made the remarks in response to suggestions
by the pro-independence opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) that
President Chen should apologize to the Taiwan people for his poor
performance in office and pardon the family of an alleged gunman who
shot the president on the eve of the 2004 presidential election.

</P>
<P>
The TSU urged President Chen to emulate the approach of
"sagacious kings of the past" who would issue an imperial order to
blame themselves for poor performance that caused suffering for the
people. President Chen should blame himself for the economic downturn
and even the March 19 shooting, according to the TSU.

</P>
<P>
In response, the presidential spokesman said that a task force is
still investigating the gunman and truth of the March 19 shooting and
that the case is yet to be solved.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone should respect the professional and independent
investigation of the law enforcers and the judicial proceedings in
uncovering the truth, " the spokesman said, adding that not even the
president or the vice president should intervene in the case.
</P>
<P>
He said President Chen and Lu have done their best during their
past five years in office and are willing to accept criticism and
suggestions with humility, although a smooth administration will
require the concerted efforts of the ruling and the opposition
parties.
</P>
<P>
"We are unable to accept anyone who uses violent methods, or even
shooting, to vent their dissatisfaction, " the spokesman said, adding
that such deeds are intolerable in a democratic society and a nation
based on human rights.
</P>
<P>
TSU Secretary-General Chen Chien-ming said Wednesday that although
there is indirect evidence to show that the alleged gunman, Chen
Yi-hsiung, shot the president due to disappointment and discontent
over his poor performance, he has since committed suicide and the gun
he used has not been found, so that the police have been unable to
announce a solution of the case.
</P>
<P>
TSU officials also said the president owes an apology to the
general public and that he should pardon the family of the suspect so
as to create an atmosphere conducive to the reconciliation of the
people and not just target one party for reconciliation. They were
referring to a high-profile meeting between President Chen and
opposition People First Party Chairman James Soong Feb. 24, which was
touted as "inter-party reconciliation."

The IRA meant to kill when it offered to shoot Provisionals who
murdered the Belfast man Robert McCartney, the Northern Ireland chief
constable said today. Hugh Orde also confirmed that his detectives
know the identities of the gang members suspected of stabbing the
father of two to death, but their investigation is being thwarted by
witnesses refusing to give evidence. Mr Orde appealed for a return to
the rule of law in the wake of the astonishing statement from the
Provisional IRA offering to shoot the men blamed for the murder of
Robert McCartney. The macabre offer was made to Mr McCartney's family
by a Provisional representative following a five-hour meeting between
IRA members and Mr McCartney's five sisters and fiancee.

CONTROL YUAN SHOULD NOT BE PHASED OUT: EX-CHIEF
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Control Yuan, the nation's supreme
watchdog body that supervises government operations, should not be
abolished or incorporated into other branches in the future
constitutional re-engineering plan, a former Control Yuan chief said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Former Control Yuan President Frederick Chien made the appeal in
an acceptance speech delivered after receiving a decoration from
President Chen Shui-bian at the Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
Chen decorated Chien with the Order of Chiang Chung-cheng with
Grand Cordon in recognition of Chien's contributions to upgrading the
Control Yuan's functions in protecting human rights and enhancing
political accountability and transparency, as well as boosting
Taiwan's democratic development in a sound and positive direction.
</P>
<P>
Chien, a career diplomat who once served as minister of foreign
affairs and representative to the United States, said the Control
Yuan has been a very important organ in the Republic of China's
constitutional political system.
</P>
<P>
"The ROC Constitution devotes six chapters to regulating the
powers and functions of the executive branch of the central
government. And the number of provisions concerning the Control Yuan
is only second to the number of clauses related to the presidency.
This indicates that the initiators of our constitution had high
expectations of the role of the Control Yuan in the government's
operations, " Chien said, adding that more than 100 countries around
the world now have organs similar to the Control Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Some people have suggested that the Control Yuan be abolished and
that its powers be incorporated either into the legislative or
administrative branch in the government's constitutional
re-engineering project.
</P>
<P>
"My observation is that such proposals would adversely affect the
exercise of the Control Yuan powers. The Control Yuan powers must be
exercised independently to ensure neutrality and impartiality in
supervising government operations," Chien said, adding his hope that
Chen will take his views into consideration.
</P>
<P>
Chien's tenure ended Jan. 31 along with all other Control Yuan
members. President Chen has presented a list of nominations for new
Control Yuan president, vice president and 27 seats in the watchdog
body for the approval of the opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan
in line with the Constitution. However, the legislature has so far
declined to screen the list and has instead asked the president to
come up with a new list. Chen has rejected such a demand, saying that
the request infringes upon his power of nomination.

ANTI-SECESSION BILL IS PROVOCATIVE: U.S. HOUSE REPRESENTATIVE

<TEXT>
<P>
David Wu, the only representative of
Taiwanese origin in the U.S. House of Representatives, said Tuesday
that China's decision to enact a so-called anti-secession law
targeting Taiwan is a provocative act.
</P>
<P>
It is regrettable that the People's Republic of China has started
to screen an anti-secession bill at a moment when cross-Taiwan Strait
relations are improving significantly, said Wu.
</P>
<P>
In conjunction with several other representatives, Wu (D-Oregon)
introduced Resolution No. 70 at the House of Representatives, urging
the U.S. government to express opposition to Beijing's proposed
anti-secession law.
</P>
<P>
China's rubber-stamp parliament -- the National People's Congress
-- began to screen the bill Tuesday, which provides the legal basis
for China's use of non-peaceful means against Taiwan in certain
situations, and is expected to pass it next week.

The people of Taiwan stay up longest and

to bed after midnight and 26 percent not getting up until after 9
a.m., according to the results of a study released recently by
ACNielsen.
</P>

14,100 consumers in 28 countries across the Asia Pacific region,
Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
It was found that 40 percent of people in the Asia Pacific region

TAIWAN VOICES CONCERN TO U.S. OVER CHINA'S ANTI-SECESSION LAW: MOFA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has
relayed the government's grave concern to Washington over China's
proposed anti-secession legislation targeting Taiwan, MOFA spokesman
Michel Lu said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the MOFA has transmitted Taiwan's stance and concern to
Washington and added that the government has noted the remarks made
by the U.S. government on the issue.
</P>
<P>
According to Lu, the MOFA views Washington's remarks as a repeat
of its long-standing stance on cross-Taiwan Strait relations -- that
it opposes any attempts by either side to change the status quo and
that it opposes any non-peaceful means to settle Taiwan's future.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher reiterated a call
for dialogue between Taiwan and China, pointing out that "passage of 
legislation is not going to help resolve the problem" across the
strait.
</P>
<P>
Boucher said it has been the long-term U.S. stance to oppose any
attempts to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful
means. He suggested that Beijing reconsider the enactment of the
proposed anti-secession law and called on the two sides to be
rational and to avoid confrontation.
</P>
<P>
The National People's Congress (NPC) , Beijing's ceremonial
parliament, is currently reviewing the anti-secession provisions
aimed at curbing Taiwan independence. It is expected to pass the law
next week, the full text of which will be made known by that time.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhaoguo, vice chairman of the NPC's Standing Committee,
explained the anti-secession law Tuesday, saying that Beijing will do
its best to obtain peaceful unification with Taiwan but that it will
use non-peaceful means and other necessary measures to protect its
sovereignty and territorial integrity should all possibilities for
peaceful unification be exhausted.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council immediately responded by
blasting the law as a blank check for an invasion of Taiwan.

Taiwan expatriates residing in Australia
went to the Chinese embassy in Canberra Wednesday to protest against
China's proposed anti-secession law.
</P>

The proposed law is now being reviewed by the National People's

Nearly 300 Taiwan expatriates and representatives from Sydney,
Melbourne, Brisbane, Canberra and Perth converged on the Chinese
embassy to deliver a protest letter and to urge Beijing to address
Taiwan public opinion by refraining from enacting the law.

The protesters then went to the U.S., British and Japanese
embassies and expressed appreciation to a recently issued joint
statement by the U.S. and Japan that Taiwan is a mutual security
concern during a Security Cnsultative Committee meeting in Washington

COA STILL HAS MISGIVINGS ABOUT ALLOWING U.S. BEEF INTO TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  9 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Council of Agriculture (COA) said
Wednesday that it still has misgivings about allowing beef from the
United States to enter Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Officials from COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection
and Quarantine made the remarks in the wake of confirmation the
previous day from the Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) on the
safety of consuming U.S. beef and that the DOH will present its
conclusion next week to the Executive Yuan for a final decision.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan purchased US$325 million-worth of U.S. beef and beef
products in 2003 and was the sixth-largest importer of U.S. beef
before it imposed the ban in December 2003 in the wake of a case of
mad cow disease in Washington State. Since then, Australian beef has
replaced U.S. beef in the Taiwan market.
</P>
<P>
The DOH suggested that when imports of U.S. beef are allowed,
only beef that is less than a certain number of months old will be
allowed in, and that offal and the bones will still be prohibited.
</P>
<P>
But bureau officials noted that the United States only started to
regulate the registration of cattle last July, and they questioned if
the regulations have been fully implemented and monitoring rigorously
carried out.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they said that the methods used to determine the age
of the cattle vary and that the results are not necessarily correct.
</P>
<P>
They further said that Japan, which is an affected area of bovine
spongiform encephalopathy, the scientific name for mad cow disease,
has expressed safety concerns about reopening its markets to U.S.
beef.
</P>
<P>
"As a non-affected country, Taiwan must act even more
cautiously," they said.

U.S. Senator Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.) said
Tuesday that if the European Union lifts its arms embargo against
China, some in Congress might support sanctions against companies in
the EU who trade with China.
</P>
<P>
Hagel said that what the United States worries about is dual-use
technology falling into the hands of the wrong people, adding that "
...obviously, sophisticated technology enhances anyone who possesses
that technology -- their defense capability, their intelligence
capacity."
</P>
<P>
But he also said, "We have some rather stringent laws in the
United States to ensure, as best as we can, that doesn't happen."
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he thinks Congress will impose sanctions against
companies if the embargo is lifted and companies start trading with
China, Hagel replied that he didn't know if that would be an option.
</P>
<P>
"But there are those here in Congress who might well support
something like that," Hagel said.
</P>
<P>
Hagel is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations International
Economic Policy, Export and Trade Promotion Subcommittee and the
co-chairman of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed the arms embargo against China shortly after its
bloody crackdown in Tiananmen Square in 1989. Recently, the EU has
been mulling lifting the ban.

Wednesday to grant permanent visa-free treatment to visitors from
Taiwan on the eve of temporary half-year, visa-exemption privileges
that begin Friday.
</P>
<P>
A foreign ministry spokesman called on Japan to continue its
visa-free treatment designed for Taiwan tourists visiting the 2005
World Exposition, to be held in Aichi from March 25 to Sept. 25,
after the event to help bolster two-way exchanges and to reciprocate
Taiwan's treatment of Japanese tourists.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has been offering visa-free treatment for Japanese
visitors since 1993, the spokesman noted.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Cabinet approved the visa-free measures on March 4
to lure Taiwan tourists to the Aichi World Exposition.
</P>
<P>
In compliance with the set of measures, visitors from Taiwan with
valid Republic of China passports will be allowed to enter Japan
visa-free from March 11 to Sept. 25 for up to 90 days.
</P>
<P>
However, the rule is not available for those Taiwan people who
plan to work or engage in money-making performances in Japan and the
Japanese government is entitled to deny entry to non grata
individuals.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government also has the power to temporarily and
fully or partially suspend the measures.

GIO TO ISSUE EXPLANATORY BOOKLETS ON 319 SHOOTING: OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 9 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Government Information Office (GIO) is
scheduled to publish explanatory booklets in English to expound on
recent developments surrounding the March 19 shooting of President
Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu, outgoing GIO
Director-General Lin Chia-lung said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lin, who tendered his resignation last week in preparation for
seeking the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's nomination to run
in the year-end mayoral election in the central city of Taichung,
made the remarks during a meeting with his successor, Yao Wen-chih,
president of TTV Culture Co., a publishing arm of Taiwan Television
Enterprise Ltd.
</P>
<P>
GIO staff are working hard to compile explanatory booklets in
English concerning the incident, Lin said. He added that contents of
such pamphlets will include results of the two lawsuits filed by the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People
First Party (PFP) in an attempt to nullify President Chen's
re-election victory in the March 20 election, subsequent developments
of a "319 shooting investigation commission" and the latest progress
made by the police in the investigation into the mysterious
election-eve shooting.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin, all the explanatory booklets will be offered to
foreign media organizations through Republic of China's
representative offices so that the international community can gain a
better understanding of related developments after the presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
Chen and Lu were slightly wounded in the election-eve shooting
when two bullets grazed their bodies as they campaigned in an
open-topped jeep in the southern city of Tainan. They defeated the
"pan-blue alliance" ticket of KMT Chairman Lien Chan and PFP Chairman
James Soong by a slim margin of less than 30,000 ballots, or 0.228
percent of the 13 million votes cast.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-blue alliance" insinuated that the shooting was staged
to boost the chances of Chen's re-election and filed two lawsuits to
appeal for an annulment of Chen's victory and for a new election.
Both suits were rejected.

'ANTI-SECESSION LAW' MARKS STARK VIOLATION OF U.N. CHARTER: VP LU
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice President Annette Lu said Wednesday
that Beijing's proposed "anti-secession law" is a brutal piece of
legislation to force Taiwan into its fold. 

</P>
<P>
"The proposed legislation reveals China's desire to use the law
to unilaterally change the status quo across the Taiwan Strait. It's
an act of provocation and a stark violation of the U.N. Charter, " Lu
said.
</P>
<P>
The outspoken vice president made the comments during an informal
meeting with the media a day after Beijing unveiled the draft version
of its so-called "anti-secession law" targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lu said although Beijing claims it will pursue peaceful
unification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, it sets a
prerequisite for negotiations that Taiwan must accept its cardinal
"one China" principle and its ultimate goal of unification.
</P>
<P>
"The gist of China's 'anti-secession' bill lies in Beijing's
demand that Taiwan unify with China. If Taiwan accepts this, peace
could prevail. Otherwise, Beijing could use non-peaceful means
against Taiwan. Once the bill is enacted, cross-strait relations will
be in an extremely dangerous state, " Lu said.
</P>
<P>
By clearly stating in the "anti-secession" bill that completing
China's unification is a sacred mission for all Chinese people,
including Taiwanese residents, Lu said the provision has revealed
China's ambition for hegemony.
</P>
<P>
"Beijing intends to annex Taiwan. Should that be the case, the 23
million people of Taiwan would form 1.8 percent of China's total
population. How outrageous is such hegemonic thinking," Lu lamented.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the use of "non-peaceful" means prescribed in
China's "anti-secession" bill is the use of force in disguise, Lu
claimed that the enactment of the bill would unilaterally change the
status quo across the Taiwan Strait. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tantamount to an act of provocation and runs against the
U.N. Charter and the 1984 U.N. declaration that recognizes people's
rights to enjoy permanent peace," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Lu, a legal scholar-turned-politician, urged local academics in
international law to prudently study how Taiwan can protect its
security, dignity and well-being in the face of China's new "legal
battle" against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the ruling Democratic Progressive Party will
organize a large protest march against Beijing's "anti-secession
law, " Lu said she will respect President Chen Shui-bian's decision.
"Protest can come in various forms. We can resort to soft-tone
diplomatic measures to express our indignation and protest," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Lu is scheduled to leave Taipei this weekend for a Central
America diplomatic tour that will take her to two of the Republic of
China's diplomatic allies in the region -- Guatemala and El Salvador.

DEFENSE MINISTER SUPPORTS REFERENDUM ON ARMS PROCUREMENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Minister of National Defense Lee Jye said
Wednesday he supports the proposal to hold a referendum on the
government's long-stalled massive arms procurement project
simultaneously with the May 14 National assembly elections.
</P>
<P>
Lee made the remarks while fielding questions at a Legislative
Yuan question-and-answer session.
</P>
<P>
It marked an about-face in Lee's attitude toward holding a
referendum on arms procurement issues. In the past, Lee once said
that as arms procrement involved professional judgment, such issues
should not be put forth for a referendum.
</P>
<P>
Lee said as local people have become more supportive of the
procurement project, he is convinced that the referendum
result will be in favor of the project.
</P>
<P>
The opposition-controlled legislature has declined to screen a
special statute that would authorize the administration to
appropriate special funds to purchase three kinds of advanced
weapons from the United States -- eight diesel-electric submarines,
six PAC III Patriot anti-missile batteries and a squadron of 12
anti-submarine aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the results of recent public opinion poll show that the
number of proponents of the special arms procurement project has been
increasing steadily.
</P>
<P>
During the legislative session, Lee also said if the legislature
eventually cuts the budget for the project, the Ministry of National
Defense will give the priority to purchasing eight diesel-electric
submarines.

CHINA IS BREAKING THROUGH DEFENSIVE ISLAND CHAIN: DEFENSE CHIEF
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 9 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland China is breaking through the
defense line of Japan, Taiwan and the Philippines, which Minister of
National Defense Lee Jye referred to Wednesday as the "first island
chain."
</P>
<P>
Fielding questions from lawmakers during an interpellation
session at the Legislative Yuan, Lee said Chinese naval ships and
submarines have often been spotted recently in waters east of Taiwan
and in the Western Pacific, a fact that demonstrates its ability to
project its military forces beyond the "first island chain."
</P>
<P>
The defense chief said China is aggressively acquiring advanced
warships in an attempt to control the seas far from its territory,
and is stepping up the capabilities of its armed forces for
amphibious landings and joint operations of aircraft and ships.
</P>
<P>
This, coupled with the Kilo-class submarines it is purchasing
from Russia, means that Beijing could easily build a cordon of
submarines around Taiwan to deprive it for a length of time from
obtaining imported materials, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that China's military is capable of attacking Taiwan via
an amphibious landing and from the air, and its ballistic missiles
deployed across the Taiwan Strait from Taiwan -- estimated to be
around 700 -- could saturation bomb the island for 10 hours. Taiwan's
armed forces would have a hard time defending itself with its current
arsenal, Lee admitted.
</P>
<P>
The operating range of Beijing's new jet fighters can cover the
seas east of Taiwan; this, combined with its long-range precision
attack weaponry, poses a serious threat to Taiwan and translates to
the entire island of Taiwan being the frontline in the event of war,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister said he didn't see any imminent danger of
invasion from China despite the legislation of its "anti-secession
law," which Lee said would set back bilateral ties to the 1950's when
the Chinese Communists and the Nationalists were still engaged in a
bitter civil war.
</P>
<P>
However, if Taiwan's political status quo remains unchanged, the
minister said, the possibility that Beijing will attack Taiwan is
slim.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister said that the controversial arms purchase
package offered by the United States which is under consideration by
the legislature in Taiwan will give Taiwan a military superiority at
the Taiwan Strait, the island, however, would need help from the U.S.
to win an all-out war with China.

CROSS-STRAIT TRANSPORT TO BE  PHASED IN: MAC
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 9 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) is
planning to phase in direct transport between Taiwan and mainland
China, although the cross-Taiwan Strait situation will remain an
uncertain factor on the way, an MAC official in charge of the issue
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chien Chuan, deputy director of the MAC's Economic Affairs
Department, made the remarks at a seminar held by a sub-group of the
main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) at the Legislative Yuan. Officials
from relevant government agencies, legislators and private-sector
executives discussed the pros and cons of the matter.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that setting up direct Taiwan-mainland transport
services is a set government policy, Chien, however, pointed out that
an improvement in the fragile cross-strait situation is the key. He
added that the MAC is projecting to phase in the links and is trying
to seek the mainland's agreement to open talks.
</P>
<P>
He said that the MAC is currently reviewing the lunar new year
charter flights and revealed that it will come up with an initial
decision in one month as to whether cross-strait passenger and cargo
transport negotiations can be modeled after the charter flights
pattern by commissioning the private sector to hold talks.
</P>
<P>
Lee Chieh-chia, director of the Assistant Chief of the General
Staff Office under the Ministry of National Defense, asserted that
the military is capable of monitoring plane movements and will deploy
adequate ground troops to safeguard Taiwan's security as long as
cross-strait airlink routes and schedules are fixed.
</P>
<P>
Lin Chih-ming, director of the Navigation and Aviation Department
under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, made it
clear that no technical problems will arise from the issue. But he
added that prior negotiations with the mainland side are a must.
</P>
<P>
Hu Chung-ying, director of the Economic Research Department at
the Council for Economic Planning and Development, opined that direct
Taiwan-mainland transport is advantageous for Taiwan in its bid to
achieve its Asia-Pacific business operations hub dream.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator Ho Chih-huei asked the government to allow exports
of Taiwan farm products to the mainland and permit charter passenger
and cargo services between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator Chu Fong-chih suggested that all Taiwan people be
included in future charter flights to help slash operating costs of
carriers.

MND WILL GIVE TOP PRIORITY TO BUYING SUBMARINES: DEFENSE MINISTER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 9 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Should the special budget required for the
purchase of U.S.-made advanced weapons be cut by the legislature, the
Ministry of National Defense (MND) will give priority to the
procurement of submarines, followed by anti-submarine aircraft and
Patriot anti-missile batteries, Minister of National Defense Lee Jye
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Fielding questions at a meeting of the National Defense Committee
under the Legislative Yuan, Lee stressed that the priority for
procurement of the proposed weapons will not be adjusted again.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet has listed a special budget of NT$610.8 billion
(US$18.23 billion) for a proposed massive arms procurement package,
under which the country plans to purchase eight diesel-electric
submarines, six PAC III Patriot anti-missile batteries and a squadron
of 12 P-3C Orion anti-submarine aircraft from the United States.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Legislator Ku Chung-lien of the opposition
People First Party said Therese Shaheen, former managing director of
the American Institute in Taiwan, has suggested that Taiwan shouldn't
buy submarines, so he questioned whether the United States just
intends to test Taiwan's loyalty and sincerity through the military
procurement proposal.
</P>
<P>
In response, the defense minister said U.S. officials have told
him that the U.S. government will not change its policy of selling
arms to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The MND has delivered a new set of publicity material to the
Legislative Yuan in a fresh attempt to lobby for lawmakers' support
for the proposed arms procurement package. In the 13-page booklet,
the ministry uses simple images to illustrate the connection between
the arms procurement and national security.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Lin Chin-hsing of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) said at the meeting that the contents of the explanatory
pamphlets are too simplistic for DPP lawmakers to defend the
government's military procurement plan.

'ANTI-SECESSION LAW' EXPOSES BEIJING'S MALINTENTIONS: DPP

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) reiterated its opposition Wednesday to China's proposed
"anti-secession law, " which it said has exposed Beijing's intent to
change unilaterally the status quo in the Taiwan Strait and to
disrupt peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
The DPP China Affairs Department described in a statement the
draft law unveiled by China's rubber stamp parliament -- the National
People's Congress -- a day earlier as a war-mandating law.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft law, the statement noted, Beijing can take
"non-peaceful" action against Taiwan under certain circumstances.
</P>
<P>
It is tantamount to giving Beijing authorities a blank check to
use force against Taiwan and will destabilize cross-strait relations,
the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the statement went on, the draft of the law is just
like an order during wartime to "protect" the citizens of Taiwan and
their property by using force.
</P>
<P>
The opposition to China's legislation, which is aimed at Taiwan,
is to defend Taiwan people's dignity and the Republic of China's
status, it stressed.

They urged the government to purge the schools' textbooks of any

EU URGED NOT TO LIFT ARMS EMBARGO AGAINST CHINA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Berlin, March 9 (CNA)
(By Y.L. Lin and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A spokesman for Germany's ruling party said
Wednesday that the European Union should not lift its arms embargo
against China at a time when Beijing is reviewing whether to enact an
anti-secession law which has escalated tensions in the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, who is responsible for foreign affairs of the
Social Democratic Party, made the remarks in an exclusive interview
recently with the West German Broadcasting Co.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has revealed the key points of the
proposed anti-secession law, but it has yet to make public the full
text of the law.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the EU has been considering lifting the arms
sales ban before June of this year, the spokesman said he thinks it
shouldn't lift the ban as it does not want to be seen as supporting
the enactment of such a law.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a senior member of Germany's opposition Christian
Democratic Party has warned that if the EU insists on lifting the ban
without considering Washington's opposition, then all efforts that
might reduce cross-strait distrust and misunderstanding will be
undermined.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the EU to be very cautious in dealing with relevant
issues and to first consult with the United States before voicing its
stance regarding the lifting of the ban.
</P>
<P>
A lawmaker from Germany's Green Party also called for the EU to
do whatever it can to maintain its arms ban on China due to the new
threat posed by Beijing to Taiwan.

U.S. CONGRESS URGED TO OPPOSE ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  March 9 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S.-China Economic and Security
Review Commission sent a letter Wednesday to the speakers of the two
houses of the U.S. Congress to suggest that Congress "immediately and
strongly" urge Beijing not to enact the proposed anti-secession law.
</P>
<P>
The commission said in the letter that enactment of the law can
only escalate tensions in the Taiwan Strait and that the law runs
directly counter to Washington's one-China policy.
</P>
<P>
The mandate of the commission, which was set up by Congress in
2000, is to examine the influence of the Sino-American economic
relationship on the United States' national security.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, the commission said that although the text of the
anti-secession law has not been released, descriptions of its nature
and thrust have been circulated throughout the global international
affairs community.
</P>
<P>
"It is apparent that its passage would needlessly inflame the
China -Taiwan situation and complicate the task of maintaining
stability in that relationship. The significant U.S. interest in
maintaining the peaceful status quo in the region would be adversely
affected, " it said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China's unilateral action of enacting such a law
would unlikely have a practical effect concerning international law
or policy, the commission said that its principal impact would be to
destabilize the already tenuous cross-strait balance by provoking
Taiwanese reaction as well as inflaming Chinese nationalist
sentiments and limiting the political maneuvering room for Beijing's
leadership to take innovative steps that might lead to a lessening of
cross-strait tensions.
</P>
<P>
The commission also said in the letter that China's intention in
enacting the law is "to create a purported legal basis for it to take
Taiwan by force."
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the anti-secession law runs directly counter to the
U.S. position that neither side of the Taiwan Strait should try to
unilaterally change the status quo, the commission said that it
believes Congress should "immediately and strongly" oppose the
enactment of the law.

CROSS-STRAIT TENSIONS LIE IN BEIJING'S ONE-CHINA PRINCIPLE: ROC REP
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
London,  March 9 (CNA)
(By N.K. Han and Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The crisis in the Taiwan Strait lies in
Beijing's insistence on its "one-China principle, " the Republic of
China representative to Britain said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Edgar Lin made the remarks when the anchorwoman of BBC
News 24 TV asked him to comment on the threat to Taiwan posed by
Beijing's proposed anti-secession law which authorizes the "use of
non-peaceful means" against the island in certain situations. The
National People's Congress (NPC), China's rubber stamp parliament, is
expected to enact the law before its annual session ends Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lin pointed out that Taiwan has been a sovereign, independent
country for over the past five decades and is not part of the
People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
The crisis in the Taiwan Strait lies in Beijing's insistence on
its one-China "principle, " Lin said, noting that in fact, other
countries have only acknowledged the one-China "policy."
</P>
<P>
The principle and policy are two different things, Lin explained,
noting that a principle cannot change, while policy, which is the
decision made by a certain body, can be altered through negotiations.
He added that this is the reason why Taiwan keeps urging China to
engage in negotiations with the island.
</P>
<P>
The ROC representative stressed that Taiwan hopes to live with
China peacefully because after all, Taiwan is in a disadvantageous
position when under military threat from China.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that in addition to deploying more than 800
missiles along its coastal provinces targeting Taiwan, Beijing has
also relentlessly squeezed Taiwan's maneuvering space
internationally.
</P>
<P>
The proposed anti-secession law is in fact an attempt by Beijing
to create an excuse to annex Taiwan, Lin claimed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an Amnesty International representative who was
interviewed during the same program said that 16 years after the
Tiananmen Square Massacre, China's human rights record has yet to
improve. He said that many who were detained before the bloody
crackdown have still not been released.
</P>
<P>
Recently, a great number of people in China have been detained
for pushing for more human rights, he said, adding that some have
even been arrested simply for visiting Web sites advocating more
human rights.
</P>
<P>
The representative from the international human rights group also
said that China executes 100,000 people a year, more than the number
of people executed in all other countries combined.
</P>
<P>
Chinese authorities have not relaxed their suppression of
political and religious groups, he continued, adding that Amnesty
International has not see any signs of improvement in China's human
rights record.
</P>
<P>
He added that if the European Union lifts its arms embargo
against China, which it has been considering for the last several
months, this will send a weird message to human rights activists in
China.
</P>
<P>
Lin agreed with the Amnesty International representative's
remarks on China's human rights record. However, he added that the
international community has focused on political suppression, saying
that this is only "a drop in the bucket" of Beijing's human rights
violations. He added that in looking at China's human rights record,
attention should also be paid to its economic exploitation of women,
children and minority groups.

TAIWAN GROUP TAKING PART IN U.N. COMMISSION ON STATUS OF WOMEN SESSION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
New York,  March 9 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A delegation of Taiwan women is taking
part in the 49th session of the United Nations' Commission on the
Status of Women being held Feb. 28-March 11 in New York.
</P>
<P>
The 23 Taiwan women are participating in their capacity as
members of non-governmental organizations (NGOs).
</P>
<P>
The delegation, led by Chang Chueh, an associate professor of
public health at National Taiwan University, has participated in
various round-table discussions, hosting three of them.
</P>
<P>
In a discussion on "Military Conflict Prevention From a Gender
Perspective" held Tuesday, the participants urged the international
community to pay attention to women's calls for peace.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen Jau-hwa, an associate professor of philosophy
at Soochow University, there is still much room for improvement in
Taiwan regarding the implementation of the Beijing Declaration and
Platform for Action for equality, development and peace adopted
during the 4th World Conference on Women in 1995.
</P>
<P>
For example, Chen said, women's participation is lacking in the
making of defense policy in Taiwan, and the government is wasting a
lot of money on arms procurement despite women's calls for peace.
</P>
<P>
Chen proposed that an independent organization be set up to
monitor the government to ensure that a gender perspective is
included in every policy.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the discussion has facilitated in-depth exchanges
between Taiwan representatives and those from other countries and has
enhanced participants' understanding of the progress of the
international peace movement.
</P>
<P>
The advocacy for peace by Taiwan women has also won international
support, which is expected to further boost the involvement of Taiwan
women in the peace movement, Chen added.
</P>
<P>
On March 1, the Taiwan delegation hosted two discussions on the
themes of promoting mental well-being of Asian women and girls
education as a key to poverty eradication.

LIFTING ARMS BAN AN ENCOURAGEMENT FOR BEIJING TO ATTACK TAIWAN: CHEN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 10 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday
that if the European Union lifts its ban on arms sales to China, the
move will be tantamount to encouraging a non-democratic, non-peaceful
country to use force against democratic Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while meeting with a delegation from the
U.S.-based Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs, a private
think tank.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the European Union imposed the arms ban against China
after the 1989 Tiananmen Massacre, where Chinese troops were
mobilized to crush a massive pro-democracy demonstration, in an
attempt to pressure Beijing to improve its human rights situation,
stem arms proliferation and retain the military balance in the Taiwan
Strait, Chen said China has since done little to meet the E.U.'s
demands.
</P>
<P>
"Since the reasons that the E.U. arms embargo was imposed in the
first place remain as before, I don't see any legitimate reason
justifying lifting the ban," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 16 years, Chen went on, China's annual defense
budget has been growing at an average rate of 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Worse still, Beijing has never renounced the option of using
force against Taiwan and has deployed more than 700 ballistic
missiles along its southeastern coast aimed at Taiwan, " Chen said,
adding that this poses a grave threat to the status quo across the
Taiwan Strait and Asia-Pacific regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
If the E.U. goes ahead and lifts the arms embargo against China,
Chen said it will be tantamount to encouraging and supporting an
undemocratic, non-peaceful country to use force against Taiwan -- one
of the most vibrant democracies in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Chen further said the joint statement issued at the end of a
recent U.S.-Japan security meeting for the first time included the
Taiwan Strait issue as one of the two countries' common strategic
objectives.
</P>
<P>
In their joint statement, the United States and Japan also
encouraged the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to talk and resolve
bilateral disputes peacefully.
</P>
<P>
"It is extremely regrettable that Beijing's proposed
'anti-secession' legislation runs completely against this common
strategic goal of maintaining regional peace and stability, " Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
While the United States and Japan have called for peaceful
solutions to cross-strait issues through dialogue, Chen said
Beijing's new legislation authorizes the use of "non-peaceful means"
to resolve cross-strait disputes.
</P>
<P>
During his recent Europe visit, Chen said, U.S. President George
W. Bush expressed his concern about the E.U. plan to lift its arms
sales ban against China because it could upset the cross-strait
military balance.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government, Congress and think tanks have also expressed
grave concern about Beijing's proposed 'anti-secession' legislation,
Chen said, adding that he is very grateful for the support from the
U.S. for Taiwan's cause.
</P>
<P>
Chen also reiterated that Taiwan will consistently serve as a
defender of the world order and guardian of democracy. "Democracy and
peace are universal values, and peace cannot be achieved without
democracy," he added.

RULING DPP TO HOLD LARGE PROTEST AGAINST 'ANTI-SECESSION LAW'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 10 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) is slated to hold a large protest March 26 in Taipei in
response to Beijing's "anti-secession" legislation targeting Taiwan,
DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Su said that the DPP plans to call 500,000 people to take to the
streets and that he may personally invite political leaders to take
part in the demonstration, including Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan, People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong, Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) Chairman Su Chin-chiang and Taipei Mayor Ma
Ying-jeou.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that he has not reported the plan to President Chen
Shui-bian nor has he invited the president to take part, Su said that
the president should weigh the issue on his own in his capacity as
head of state.
</P>
<P>
In the face of the impending passage of the law next week crafted
to stem Taiwan independence, the 23 million people in Taiwan,
regardless of their political affiliations or stances, should unite
to counter Beijing's intimidation, he said, adding that it is time
that the people of Taiwan show their solidarity to the international
community.
</P>
<P>
Saying that the proposed "anti-secession law" is tantamount to
writing a blank check for Beijing to invade Taiwan at any time, the
DPP chairman called it clear proof of Beijing's long-term plan to
alter the cross-Taiwan Strait status quo and to dictate Taiwan's
future by force despite the olive branches extended by President Chen
in the past.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the planned demonstration will be peaceful to
underscore the Taiwan people's firm resolve to protect their values
and lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, PFP spokesman Hsieh Kung-ping said that Soong will not
participate in the protest and urged Taiwan and mainland China to be
rational in order not to breach the valuable opportunity to forge
rapport now at a time when cross-strait tensions have showed initial
signals of improvement.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh also called on Beijing to treasure Taiwan's middle-road
efforts after Chen and Soong issued a 10-point joint statement late
last month promising to maintain the name of the Republic of China in
view of the fragile cross-strait situation. Both sides of the strait
should engage in peace-making for mutual benefits, he urged.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, pro-Taiwan independence groups, such as the TSU and
the Human Chain Alliance of Taiwan, said that they will mobilize
supporters to take part in the March 26 demonstration with the DPP.
</P>
<P>
The alliance issued a declaration demanding a name change of
Taiwan's official designation, a new constitution, a referendum to
decide Taiwan future status and entry into the United Nations as well
as insisting that Taiwan is an independent and sovereign state.

STARTING APRIL 1 SEPARATING GARBAGE FOR PICKUP MANDATORY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   March  10  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a three-month grace period
accompanied by publicity, the requirement to separate garbage will be
fully implemented in 10 cities and counties islandwide beginning
April 1, with violators facing fines, the Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Household garbage or refuse from shops is to be classified into
three categories -- ordinary garbage, recyclable garbage and food
scraps -- before they are taken out to garbage trucks, EPA officials
said.
</P>
<P>
The 10 cities and counties that are included in the first phase
of the islandwide garbage classification program are the cities of
Taipei, Kaohsiung, Keelung, Hsinchu, Taichung, Chiayi, and Tainan;
and the counties of Ilan, Taichung and Kaohsiung.
</P>
<P>
Garbage that does not fall into any of the three categories will
not be collected in regular pickups. Violators will be issued tickets
for fines ranging from NT$1,200 (US$39) to NT$6,000 (US$195).
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 1 this year the EPA began to educate Taiwan citizens
about the garbage classification and recycling program.
</P>
<P>
The program is scheduled to be expanded to all 25 cites and
counties nationwide next year.
</P>
<P>
Taipei City has been using a similar program for more than two
years.

SUICIDE NOTES BELIEVED TO HAVE EXISTED DESPITE MEDIA REPORTS: OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 10 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A chief investigator of the election-eve
shooting of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu on
March 19, 2004 said Thursday that five family members had read the
suicide notes of the shooting suspect, despite news reports that no
notes were left behind.
</P>
<P>
Legislators Lee Ching-hua and Sun Ta-chien of the opposition
People First Party cited media reports that alleged that the
suspect's sister and nephew had come forward to say that Chen
Yi-hsiung -- the prime suspect in the shooting -- did not leave any
suicide notes as claimed by his wife and that police had not followed
proper procedures in questioning her.
</P>
<P>
Hou Yu-ih, commissioner of the Criminal Investigation Bureau,
said: "As everyone sees the case from different angles, I'll respect
their views and shoulder all responsibility for the case,."
</P>
<P>
The legislators asked if the media reports were true.
</P>
<P>
Hou said that based on a wiretap, police took Chen Yi-hsiung's
wife and children in for questioning because they suspected they
might have destroyed evidence. However, they were released in less
than 24 hours. Police subsequently questioned them again.
</P>
<P>
All the questioning was recorded, Hou said, adding that this
would show that proper police procedures were followed.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the suicide notes, which police said were destroyed by
Chen Yi-hsiung's wife, Hou said that Chen Yi-hsiung's family said
that only five of his closest family members read them, and that Chen
Yi-hsiung's family decided in a meeting shortly after he allegedly
committed suicide by drowning March 28 that they would not reveal the
contents to anyone. They are the only ones who know what was actually
contained in the suicide letters, Hou said.
</P>
<P>
On the location of the gun that was allegedly used to fire shots
at President Chen and Vice President Lu, Hou admitted that it would
be rather difficult to locate, adding, "This is probably the most
difficult case in my life."
</P>
<P>
Even if the gun is found, police still cannot be 100 percent
certain that it is the gun used in the shooting, Hou said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that police were correct to identify Chen Yi-hsiung
as the prime suspect, although all the evidence need to be
substantiated.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, legislators asked if Chen Yi-hsiung's family had been
put under house arrest. State Public Prosecutor-General Wu Ying-chao
said this was not the case and that he will convene a meeting to
discuss the possibility of making Chen Yi-hsiung's family available
to the media and human rights groups, although he said that the
wishes of the family must be respected.
</P>
<P>
Hou said that police obtained prior consent of the family before
they were relocated away from their residence on Monday, and that
they have complete and unrestricted freedom of movement.
</P>
<P>
Kuo Jen-ni, chief prosecutor of the Tainan Prosecutor's Office,
categorically denied that police have put Chen Yi-hsiung's family
under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that the family wanted to be taken away from the
dogged pursuit of the media and had asked for police protection. The
media shouldn't blame the police because the family wants its
privacy.
</P>
<P>
She said that the family now feels safe and are not all staying
in one place.
</P>
<P>
Police announced Monday that they had identified Chen Yi-hsiung
as the key suspect, although he apparently committed suicide off
Anping Harbor in Tainan March 28. His body was recovered the
following day and hastily cremated. The suicide notes were burned and
the gun that he allegedly owned has not been found.
</P>
<P>
The assassination attempt took place in the southern city of
Tainan where the president and the vice president were riding in an
open jeep during eleventh-hour campaigning. President Chen won
reelection the following day by a razor-thin margin against his
rival, Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan, who said the shooting was
staged and unfairly swayed the result of the election.

BEIJING UNWISE TO ENACT 'ANTI-SECESSION' LAW: ANALYST
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  March 9 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the Beijing authorities were wiser,
they would refrain from enacting the so-called "anti-secession" law
targeting Taiwan, Nancy Bernkopf Tucker, a professor of history at
Georgetown University, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tucker, who specializes in American-East Asian relations, made
the remarks the day after China's rubber-stamp parliament -- the
National People's Congress -- began to screen an "anti-secession"
bill Tuesday, which will provide a legal basis for China's use of
non-peaceful means against Taiwan in certain situations. 
</P>
<P>
"After having waited with great concern about what the
"anti-secession" law might say, we can, on the one hand, be relieved
that it is fairly mild and allows Beijing to act with flexibility
should it wish to do so, " Tucker said. "It imposes no explicit
deadlines and doesn't use the term 'one country, two systems, '" she
went on.
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, there are undesirable portions that can cause
future difficulties," Tucker said, adding that it essentially revives
a third 'if'; that indefinite delay is unacceptable, leaves vague
what is meant by a major incident that would trigger the use of
force, and is confusing over what actions by Taipei might be judged
as going too far.
</P>
<P>
"Beijing would have been wiser not to have enacted the law and
its likely use to parry the U.S. Taiwan Relations Act probably will
no doubt lead to future problems," Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Relations Act, passed by the U.S. Congress and signed
into law by President Carter in 1979 after Washington switched its
diplomatic ties from Taipei to Beijing, has served to regulate
unofficial relations between Taipei and Washington.

FOREIGN SPOUSES TO ENJOY PRENATAL CHECK-UP, CONTRACEPTION SUBSIDIES

<P>
The government will subsidize the costs of
prenatal examinations and birth control for foreign spouses who are
not covered by the National Health Insurance program, officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to Su Shu-chen, head of the Maternal, Infant and
Genetic Health Division of the Bureau of Health Promotion under the
Department of Health, the policy has been approved by the Cabinet,
and the date of implementation will be announced by the Ministry of
the Interior soon.
</P>
<P>
In the future, the government will subsidize NT$600 (US$19.49)
for each prenatal visit by foreign wives for up to five visits and
NT$1,000 for the installation of intra-uterine devices as a means of
contraception, Su said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, foreign husbands will enjoy a subsidy of NT$2,500 for
sterilization surgery, Su said.
</P>
<P>
Su said the policy is aimed at protecting the health of the
foreign spouses and their children, many of whom are financially
disadvantaged.
</P>
<P>
The number of foreign wives residing in Taiwan, including those
from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau, totalled 338,000 as of the
end of 2004, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Foreign spouses of Taiwan nationals can only join the National
Health Insurance program four months after they enter the country.
</P>
<P>
The new policy is estimated to cost the government NT$13.5
million a year, Su said.

<P>
Foreign response has been enthusiastic to
a Taiwan Machinery Promotion Project (TMP) , as scores of machinery
tool distributors from across the world will travel to Taiwan to take
part in the 2005 Taipei International Machinery Tool Show set to open
March 15, organizers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA), which is
in charge of organizing the annual exhibition, said that foreign
buyers from Brazil, Canada, India, Italy, Japan, Germany, Mexico,
Poland, South Korea, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates will also
participate in a series of seminars from March 14 to March 18 to
explain their purchasing policies.
</P>
<P>
Companies among them include ATLAS and VITOR from Brazil, Gross
Machinery Group from Canada, IWEMA from Germany, MIND, VISMAC and UTS
from Italy, MEPEPSA from Mexico, BPLANALP from Poland, PHU BINH from
Vietnam and LAROSA from the United Arab Emirates, according to TAITRA
officials.
</P>
<P>
In addition, TAITRA officials said that the Korea Machine Tool
Manufacturers' Association composed of 11 companies, the Turkey
delegation made of 13 companies and the 20-company India mission will
hold negotiations with Taiwan counterparts on their own.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan-made machinery tools have gained increased popularity
among foreign buyers thanks to their fine quality and reasonable
prices, they said, adding that the TMP plan initiated by TAITRA this
year is set to serve as an efficient broker to introduce domestically
made products to professional foreign distributors.
</P>
<P>
The non-profit TAITRA, Taiwan's leading trade promoter and
formerly known as the China External Trade Development Council, was
set up in 1970 to help Taiwan businesses explore international trade
opportunities.

OVERSEAS TAIWANESE TO CAMPAIGN AGAINST 'ANTI-SECESSION' LAW

Members of Taiwanese communities in
Boston and New England met recently to voice their opposition to
Beijing's enactment of an "anti-secession" law targeting Taiwan,
officials from the Boston Chapter of the Global Alliance for
Democracy and Peace (GADP) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Taiwanese and overseas Chinese communities in the
United States decided to make phone calls or send e-mails to
influential people or media to amplify their opposition to the
soon-to-be passed Chinese law that would allow the Chinese military
to use "non-peaceful means" should Taiwan move toward independence.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, jointly sponsored by the GADP -- a
democracy-championing arm under the auspices of Taiwan's Overseas
Chinese Affairs Commission -- the Formosan Association of Public
Affairs, the Taiwanese Clan Association in Boston and several Taiwan
trade associations in New England, also issued a five-point
statement.
</P>
<P>
The five points are: to oppose the enactment of the
"anti-secession" law by the totalitarian government of China; to ask
the European Union to retain its arms embargo against China; to urge
the Chinese regime to respect the will of the 23 million people on
Taiwan; to staunchly support peaceful exchanges between people across
the Taiwan Strait; and to safeguard the universal values of
democracy, freedom, peace and human rights.

Taiwan during her upcoming visit to Asia.
</P>
<P>
At a question-and-answer session, Culberson said that he would
like to bring the people of Taiwan to Rice's attention, and described
Taiwan as who he described as "a shining city on a hill demonstrating
to the people of China the benefits of democracy and freedom."

Culberson said to Rice: "I sincerely hope that you, in your visit

of Taiwan and the good work that they have done in building their
democracy and freeing up their country, because they truly are a city
on a hill, and I hope that we can do something tangible there to
encourage them."
</P>
<P>
Rice apparently dodged this part of Culberson's remarks as she
continued to talk about other matters. Noting that time was limited,
Rice cut short her comments regarding Culberson's statement and asked
the representative's consent to allowing her to supplement her
answers in written form. .

CONVICTED YUNLIN MAGISTRATE TO BE RELIEVED OF DUTIES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 10 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yunlin County Magistrate Chang Jung-wei
will be relieved of his duties for having been convicted of
vote-buying by the Supreme Court, the Ministry of the Interior (MOI)
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
An MOI spokesman made the remarks after the Supreme Court meted
out its final verdict earlier in the day that Chang was guilty of
buying votes in 1994 when he was vying for reelection as speaker of
the Yunlin County Council.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court upheld the Tainan High Court's one-year
sentence for Chang, plus a two-year deprivation of his civil rights.
The Supreme Court ruling was final.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has not yet received the Supreme Court's verdict,
the spokesman said, adding that it will relieve Chang of his duties
once it receives it.
</P>
<P>
According to current regulations, the MOI must relieve a local
government chief of his or her duties if he or she is given a prison
term that can neither be suspended nor commuted into a fine.
</P>
<P>
As the tenure left by Chang is less than two years, the MOI
spokesman said no by-election has to be held to elect a successor.
Instead, the Cabinet is authorized by law to name a replacement to
serve out the remaining term.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Chang has already been suspended and detained since last
December for his alleged involvement in a corrupt scandal. His deputy
is now acting as Yunlin county magistrate. However, the MOI spokesman
said, the law requires Chang's deputy, a political appointee, to be
relieved of his duties along with Chang.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court also upheld the high court's sentence for
Chang's wife, Wang Yue-hsia -- an eight-month prison term with
three-year suspension.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen Yunlin County councilors at the time who accepted a free
overseas trip from Chang in return for their support for his bid for
speaker were each given seven-month jail terms, but the sentences for
all but five of them were suspended for two years, according to the
Supreme Court verdict.
</P>
<P>
Chang, who served as speaker of the Yunlin County Council from
1990 to 1997, and from 1999 to 2001, was elected as magistrate in
2001. He was suspected of bribery surrounding the construction of an
incinerator in Linnei, Yunlin County during his term as magistrate
and was wanted by prosecutors for questioning. He was arrested by
police Dec. 10, 2004 for ignoring public prosecutors' subpoenas.

VP LU SUGGESTS LEGAL BATTLE TO COUNTER 'ANTI-SECESSION' LAW

<P>
Vice President Annette Lu suggested
Thursday that international legal means be used to repel Beijing's
"anti- secession" law aimed at quelling Taiwan independence.
</P>
<P>
Lu made the remarks at the Presidential Office during a meeting
with local reporters.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a plan by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) to organize a large demonstration March 26 in Taipei to protest
Beijing's "anti-secession" legislation, Lu contended that "a
demonstration must be staged, " but she added that "it is by no means
the only way" in the face of Beijing's move to enact a law with the
aim of eventual unification with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lu proposed the government make its case to the international
community by launching a legal battle in view of the law's
anticipated passage in the middle of next week.
</P>
<P>
She called for wisdom and solidarity to counter Beijing and urged
the government not to dance to the tone of Beijing and refrain from
emotional reactions.
</P>
<P>
The vice president expressed her belief that the international
community will respond to Beijing's "anti-secession" legislation on
the grounds that the law is counterproductive to international
interests and goes against the universal principles of the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang announced earlier the same day that
the DPP will hold a large protest against Beijing, planning to
attract 500,000 people to join forces with the party.
</P>
<P>
Pro-independence groups, including the Taiwan Solidarity Union --
a political ally of the DPP -- also voiced support for the planned
rally and promised to show solidarity with the DPP in the activity.

TAIWAN INDUSTRIAL PARK IN EL SALVADOR COULD BE REALITY WITHIN 3 YEARS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 10 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice President Annette Lu on Thursday said
she hopes that a proposed "Taiwan Park" for industries to set up shop
in El Salvador could be accomplished in the remaining three years of
President Chen Shui-bian's term.
</P>
<P>
Lu will leave Taiwan Saturday at the head of a large delegation
to visit El Salvador and Guatemala. She will attend the Democratic
Pacific Assembly's American regional meeting in Guatemala and inspect
the environment of El Salvador for the possibility of establishing a
"Taiwan Park."
</P>
<P>
Lu said that a high-tech advisory committee under the
Presidential Office first broached the idea and President Chen
instructed the Executive Yuan to study the project.
</P>
<P>
After the project was approved, she called El Salvador President
Elias Antonio Saca, who was excited and said he would work to make
the project a reality, including providing sufficient water and
electricity to the park.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that the project requires El Salvador to provide 200
hectares of national land in the first stage. Taiwan will then help
with the introduction of agricultural and livestock concerns and
aquaculture and processing industries in the park. The companies can
aim to create their own brands to export to all of America.
</P>
<P>
In comparison with past economic assistance Taiwan offers to
the ROC's diplomatic allies, Lu said the project will not only give
fish or fishing rods, but will be to "grow fish" together with the
allies, adding that the successful experience of Taiwan industries
will be able to expand to other allies in Central America.
</P>
<P>
Noting that President Chen has only a little more than three
years left in office, Lu said that if the project is feasible, it
will be the first time that the government, working hand in hand with
the private sector, will have made such an inroad into Central
America, which will contribute to Taiwan businessmen reaching out to
the world and help Taiwan's bid to become an observer of the
Organization of American States.
</P>
<P>
Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-long, who
will concurrently serve as the head of the delegation's inspection
team, said that five countries in Central America are now discussing
with the United States the signing of a free trade agreement and an 
American Free Trade Zone covering 34 countries in the region will
also be established. 
</P>
<P>
If Taiwan businessmen establish factories in Central America,
they will enjoy 30 percent tariff incentives for their textile
products, Chen added.

Taiwan's economic growth rate for 2005 is
projected at more than 4.5 percent, but the government will try its
best to challenge the goal of 5 percent, according to the
Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD).
</P>
<P>
Affected by a global economic slowdown, the island's economic
growth this year is forecast to move between 4.0 percent and 4.7
percent, the CEPD said in a report delivered Wednesday to the
Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Among other economic development goals is to have the per capita
income hit US$15,000 this year, reach 4 percent for the jobless rate
and less than 2.0 percent for the consumer price index growth rate,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Although domestic electricity and water rates are expected to be
raised, the impact of an increase in the rates on domestic consumer
prices will be reduced should such hikes be done in different stages,
the CEPD pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the CEPD said that the slowdown in international raw
material price hikes and the continued appreciation of the local
currency against the greenback will help reduce imported commodity
prices and wholesale prices.

RATIO OF ABORIGINES IN FREE TRADE ZONES TO BE CUT TO 1 PERCENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 10 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ratio of aboriginal people working in
Taiwan's free trade zones will be cut to 1 percent from the 5 percent
as currently stated in regulations, the nation's top economic planner
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hu Sheng-cheng, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD), was responding to questions by Legislator Lai
Shyh-bao of the opposition New Party about the progress of the free
trade zones.
</P>
<P>
According to regulations governing the establishment of the free
trade zones, the ratio of aborigines should account for 5 percent of
the total workforce in the zone. Enterprises have complained about
this figure, saying that the ratio is too high considering the fact
that the number of aboriginal people in the proportion of the total
population is low.
</P>
<P>
According to bills to protect the rights of aboriginal peoples,
government agencies, public schools and public enterprises in cities
and counties other than the outlying islands of Penghu, Kinmen and
Lienchiang County, those institutions that employ over 100 people
must have at least 1 percent aboriginal people in their workforce
</P>
<P>
In private schools, groups or private companies whose total
workforce surpasses 200, the employment of aboriginal people should
no be lower than 0.5 percent of the total workforce.
</P>
<P>
Judging from the ratio, the requirement of 5 percent seems to be
too stringent, Hu noted.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that the CEPD has coordinated with related government
agencies and determined that the ratio for employing aboriginal
workers be cut to 1 percent, although the figure will still have to
be discussed with the Council of Aboriginal Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Taichung Harbor will be the country's third free trade zone. The
first one was the northern Keelung Harbor, which started operations
in October 2004, and the other one was the southern Kaohsiung
Harbor, which started operations earlier this year.

BE CALM IN THE FACE OF 'ANTI-SECESSION' LAW: KMT

<TEXT>
<P>
The legislative caucus of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) said Thursday that the cross-strait situation must
be dealt with calmly amid reports that China will soon enact an
"anti-secession" law targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Tseng Yung-chuan, executive director of the KMT Policy Committee,
said that the KMT caucus is against the "anti-secession" law, adding
that Taiwan should handle cross-trait situations in a calm and
rational fashion.
</P>
<P>
"We must solve and not create problems, " Tseng said, adding that
the proposed "anti-secession" law will only be finalized next Monday
and that the KMT will respond properly after seeing the final result.
</P>
<P>
Noting that legislators from the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party and its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, have proposed their
own draft "anti-annexation laws" to counter Beijing's
"anti-secession" law, Tseng said that the KMT has yet to see the
draft laws, and will decide whether to support them only after seeing
their contents.

NY TIMES REPORTER CLARIFIES WORDING ABOUT '319' SHOOTING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 10 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A New York Times reporter who described
Taiwan police's identification of a dead man as the key suspect in
the mysterious election-eve shooting of President Chen Shui-bian last
year as something out of a "one dime novel" has rephrased his wording
in a follow-up report, the Government Information Office (GIO) said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Keith Bradsher told GIO officials stationed in New York a day
earlier that it was not his intention to denigrate Taiwan police and
prosecution authorities' efforts at investigations into the March 19,
2004 shooting of President Chen and Vice President Annette Lu, GIO
Director-General Lin Chia-lung said.
</P>
<P>
Bradsher was quoted as having clarified that his "one dime novel"
wording in the first place was mainly aimed at highlighting the
theatrical nature of the event. He said he already changed the
wording to "a sequence of events worthy of a pulp crime novel" in his
later article, titled "Suspect in shooting of president identified, "
published in the March 8 edition of the International Herald Tribune.
</P>
<P>
After Bradsher's "one dime novel" report was posted on the New
York Times Web site Tuesday, Lin said, it was widely quoted by local
opposition politicians and news media and given a negative
interpretation, resulting in a distortion of the image of local law
enforcement agencies. Therefore, Lin said, the GIO's New York office
took the initiative to inform Bradsher of the misunderstandings in
Taiwan because of his report.
</P>
<P>
Since the team investigating the shooting unveiled its latest
findings and investigative procedures early this week, Lin said the
GIO has translated all relevant data and information into English and
presented them to the nation's overseas offices and journalists
posted in Taiwan by major international news organizations for
reference.
</P>
<P>
Lin said foreign news media has generally given faithful reports
about the professionalism and strenuous efforts shown by local police
and prosecution authorities in probing the case.
</P>
<P>
The special investigative team identified Chen Yi-hsiung, 63, as
the key suspect in the March 19 shooting Monday after several months
of tracking down numerous clues. Chen Yi-hsiung was found dead in
Anping Harbor in the southern city of Tainan March 29 last year -- 10
days after the shooting -- in what police have said was an apparent
suicide.
</P>
<P>
President Chen and Lu were slightly wounded when two homemade
bullets grazed them as they campaigned in an open jeep in Tainan.
After the Chen-Lu ticket narrowly won reelection the following day,
the sole challenging ticket of Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and
People First Party Chairman James Soong accused the president of
having staged the shooting to win sympathy votes and filed two
lawsuits to challenge the election result. The shooting is believed
to have gravely aggravated hostility between the ruling and
opposition camps.

MAC URGES CHINA TO RESPECT DEMOCRACY IN HONG KONG AFTER TUNG RETIRES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 10 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) official
urged the Beijing leadership Thursday to respect the people of Hong
Kong and their pursuit of freedom and democracy in the future now
that Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa has confirmed that he wishes to
step down.
</P>
<P>
Tung citing health reasons for the move, and hoped that his
bosses in Beijing will approve his resignation "as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
MAC Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san said Thursday that generally
speaking, Hong Kong's freedom and democracy that were developed
during British colonial rule, have been oppressed under Beijing's
"one country, two systems" formula imposed since Hong Kong was
returned to China in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Beijing authority should respect the people of Hong Kong and
their desire for freedom and democracy, Chiu said, adding that
hopefully relations between Taiwan and Hong Kong will improve instead
of retrogress after a new Hong Kong chief executive is appointed by
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
In a statement announcing his resignation, Tung said that over
the past eight years, Hong Kong has successfully showcased the "one
country, two systems" initiative, in which the people of Hong Kong
govern themselves, enjoy a high degree of autonomy and continue to
live in a free and democratic society.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said that he has no idea why Tung resigned and that it is
the MAC's established policy not to comment on personnel changes in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Chiu would not speculate on who will succeed Tung or the future
of Hong Kong, saying only that Taiwan looks forward to closer ties
with Hong Kong in the years to come under a new leader.

ARMS PACKAGE NEEDED TO MAINTAIN MILITARY BALANCE: DEFENSE MINISTER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  10 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Minister of National Defense Lee Jye
appealed to opposition lawmakers once again Thursday to support the
defense ministry's purchase plan for arms from the United States,
saying that if no new purchases are made, the cross-strait military
balance will severely tilt in China's favor by 2012.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China's defense budget is growing at a double-digit
pace, Lee said that the cross-strait military balance will seriously
favor China if Taiwan fails to secure the weapon systems that it has
planned to purchase from the United States since 1996.
</P>
<P>
Lee was referring to the six Patriot PAC-3 anti-missile
batteries, eight diesel-fueled submarines and a squadron of 12
anti-submarine aircraft.
</P>
<P>
By 2012, Lee said, when China's and Taiwan's air and navy combat
capabilities are at a prospective ratio of 2.87: 1, the mainland will
be sufficiently capable of taking Taiwan by force.
</P>
<P>
This, of course, does not necessarily mean that China will invade
Taiwan in 2012. The truth is that the "red light" may flash in the
cross- strait military balance by that year, with Taiwan being on the
vulnerable side, if the island continues to lag in procuring advanced
weaponry, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Lee made the remarks at a news conference after he paid courtesy
calls on lawmakers from the opposition Kuomintang and the Taiwan
Solidarity Union while lobbying for the passage of the budget for the
U.S. weapon systems.
</P>
<P>
Noting that a cut in the budget is acceptable and understandable,
Lee said hopefully the cut will be reasonable and not result in
having to abandon the purchase plan.

PRESIDENT REAFFIRMS DETERMINATION TO BOOST CROSS-STRAIT RAPPROCHEMENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   March  10  (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian Thursday
reaffirmed his administration's pragmatic stance of boosting
reconciliation and rapprochement with China to secure peace and
stability in the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the reaffirmation while addressing an annual Hsieh Nien
Fan business dinner organized by the American Chamber of Commerce in
Taipei.
</P>
<P>
"The major obstacle to cross-strait rapprochement resides in
different political systems and Beijing's reluctance to give up using
'non-peaceful means' to resolve disputes between the two sides,"
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Taiwan has sincerity and goodwill in seeking
reconciliation with China and that the country will never retreat
from its efforts to achieve this goal.
</P>
<P>
However, the president stressed that his administration will by
no means give up its long-standing cause -- safeguarding Taiwan's
democratic system -- while seeking cross-strait rapprochement.
</P>
<P>
The most pragmatic way to deal with cross-strait issues isn't to
use "non-democratic, non-peaceful" means, which will make both sides
turn away from each other, Chen noted, stressing that only through
boosting democracy and freedom can the fruits of cross-strait
civilian, economic and trade exchanges be secured.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Chen also quoted former U.S. President Bill
Clinton and incumbent President George W. Bush as saying that
democracy and peace are not only the common languages of Taiwan and
the United States but also great incentives for the promotion of
bilateral economic and trade exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Chen reiterated that his administration is willing to join hands
with the United States to promote sustainable economic development
and co-prosperity and will do everything possible to seek inter-party
reconciliation, solidify the democratic system, seek cross-strait
peace and participate in the international community.

PRESIDENT CALLS FOR INCREASING TAIWAN-U.S. ECONOMIC INTERACTION

<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian called Thursday
for a further increase in Taiwan-U.S. economic interaction, which he
said has played the most important role in the development of
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the annual Hsieh Nien Fan business dinner of the
American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei, Chen said that he has been
satisfied with the increasing economic exchanges between the two
countries in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan and the U.S. resumed sub-Cabinet-level trade consultations
last November in Washington, D.C. under the bilateral Trade and
Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) after a six-year hiatus, Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day meeting, Chen said, the two sides had
constructive talks on the trade of agricultural and pharmaceutical
products, telecommunications, government procurement accords and
issues related with the new round of talks of the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. delegation to the meeting recognized that Taiwan had
made tremendous progress in cracking down on commercial piracy and in
IPR protection, he noted, adding that the Office of the U.S. Trade
Representative (USTR) subsequently removed Taiwan from its "Special
301 priority watch list" in January.
</P>
<P>
The fact shows that Taiwan-U.S. trade and economic ties have been
further strengthening, he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
The president also said that his administration will create more
room for Taiwan's substainable development and international
cooperation based on the principles of speeding up globalization,
easing restrictions regarding certain laws and regulations,
increasing infrasctructure construction and improving the cultivation
of talented people.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is ready to face the rapidly changing era of globalization
and its economic transformation, he affirmed.
</P>
<P>
Vice Premier Wu Rong-i, Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen,
Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh, Council for Economic
Planning and Development Chairman Kung Jaw-sheng and American
Institute in Taiwan's Taipei Office Director Douglas Paal were also
present at the annual event.

Taiwan is expected to continue to enjoy

U.S. MILITARY BRASS CONCERNED ABOUT CHINA'S 'ANTI-SECESSION' LAW

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Admiral William Fallon, commander of
the U.S. Pacific Command, Thursday said he was concerned about
China's "anti-secession" legislation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a full committee hearing on the FY2006 defense budget
request at the House Armed Services Committee, Fallon said that the
"anti-secession" legislation that contains language that includes
other-than-peaceful means as a potential step in dealing with the
Taiwan issue is "certainly not something we would like to see."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military cannot solve the problem on its own, he noted,
suggesting that it needs help from all the agencies of the government
and U.S. allies as well.
</P>
<P>
The first step would be reemphasizing U.S. policy regarding the
status quo, emphasizing no unilateral moves by either sides of the
Taiwan Strait, he went on.
</P>
<P>
"We might facilitate efforts to peacefully resolve this by
emphasizing those areas of shared interests, particularly between
ourselves and China, stability in the Korean peninsula, the
tremendous economic benefits that flow today and could continue to
grow, the very, very robust cross-strait economic activities, as one
example, the reestablished commercial air travel between Taiwan and
the mainland," he added.
</P>
<P>
Fallon pledged that he plans to do the best he can to support a
peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue.

Whatever things you do not wish that others should do unto you, do
not do unto them. In your public life in the State as well as in your
private life in your family, give no one just cause for complaint
against you."

SCHRODER URGED NOT TO SUPPORT LIFTING OF EU ARMS BANS ON CHINA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
(By Y.L. Lin and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Berlin, March 10 CNA) Four members of the European Parliament
from various German political parties on Thursday jointly sent a
letter to German Chancellor Gerhard Schroder to voice their
opposition to a lifting of the European Union's arms embargo against
China.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentarians who sent the letter are Elmar Brok of the
Christian Democratic Party, who is president of the EP's Foreign
Affairs Committee, Alexander Lambsdorff of the Liberal Democratic
Party, Cem Ozdemir of the Green Party, and another Green Party
member.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese National People's Congress revealed at its current
annual plenary session being held in Beijing the key contents of the
anti-secession bill. The congress is expected to pass the bill into
law before the conclusion of the annual session Monday.
</P>
<P>
Urging the German chancellor to change his stance of supporting a
lifting of the arms sales ban against China, the parliamentarians
said in the letter that a lifting of the ban, which was imposed after
the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre, would violate the EU's human
rights policy, as well as jeopardize the close relations between the
EU and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Schroder had reiterated his support for a lifting of the ban at
the U.S.-EU summit meeting held two weeks ago in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
The German Bundestag is set to discuss at its March 17 session
issues regarding the anti-secession law and the lifting of the arms
embargo against China.
</P>
<P>
The EU has been considering lifting the arms sales ban for
several months. Both the United States and Taiwan are fiercely
opposed to a lifting of the ban.

TAIWAN OFFICIAL INVITES MINNESOTA GOVERNOR TO VISIT

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An official of the Republic of China's
mission in Chicago has invited Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty to
visit Taiwan during his trip to China and Hong Kong later this year.
</P>
<P>
Shao Ping-yun, an information official of the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Office in Chicago, made the invitation in a letter he sent
to the Minneapolis Star Tribune, the largest newspaper in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
Pawlenty is scheduled to lead a delegation to visit China and
Hong Kong in November mainly to inspect the information technology
(IT) industry there.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan is geographically close to China and Hong Kong
and excels in the IT industry, Shao urged the governor to include
Taiwan in his visit to the region.
</P>
<P>
Shao noted that Taiwan is the 17th largest economic entity in the
world, and the United States' eighth largest trading partner, as well
as Minnesota's 14th largest export market.
</P>
<P>
Although China's population is 56 times that of Taiwan, Taiwan
people purchased an average of US$940 worth of American products last
year, compared with only US$30 purchased on average by mainland
citizens, Shao noted.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan excels in a number of industries, Shao said, noting that 
it is the third largest IT industry producer. Taiwan is also very
industrialized, and has a strong demand for Minnesota's agricultural,
environmental protection and other products, he pointed out.

TAIWAN 'COMFORT WOMEN' PROTEST AFTER JAPANESE COURT REJECTS CLAIMS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 11 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two representatives of former Taiwanese
"comfort women" on Friday protested against the Japanese government's
"inhumanity" and demanded an apology after their request for
compensation was rejected by a Japanese court late last month.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Chen Tao, 83, accompanied by members of a women's group and
a dozen legislators, said that she was forced into sex slavery by the
Japanese Imperial Army during World War II while she was still a
girl.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want compensation. I want an apology from the Japanese
government. Let the world know this, and I'll be content, " said
Cheng, who sells coconuts in Pingtung, southern Taiwan for a living.
</P>
<P>
Another former comfort woman, Chen Yan, asked for assistance from
all quarters in her pursuit of justice.
</P>
<P>
Liao Yin-chi, chairwoman of the Taipei Women's Rescue Foundation,
noted that the Japanese court rejected the compensation claims on the
grounds that the 20-year statute of limitations period had expired
before the claims were filed and on the grounds that individuals
cannot be the main claimants in a suit involving national
compensation.
</P>
<P>
The foundation will sponsor a "Million People Around The World
Sign Up" signature gathering campaign at the Tamshui MRT Station
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In April, the group will join hands with its counterparts in South
Korea, Indonesia, and the Philippines -- where women were also forced
to serve in Japanese military brothels during WWII -- to appeal their
case at the U.N.
Human Rights Committee.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan will not rule out the possibility of filing war
compensation claims at the International Criminal Tribunal at The
Hague, Liao added.
</P>
<P>
The women's group also suggested that the topic of comfort women
be included in senior high school history textbooks, that a memorial
monument at a site in Hualien, believed to have housed a military
brothel during WWII when Taiwan was under Japanese colonial rule, be
established, complete with historical photo exhibition, that pressure
be applied to the Japanese government to enact a law to compensate
the comfort women, and that a million signatures be collected
globally to lend support for the cause of the comfort women.

DPP SOLICITS SUPPORT FOR RALLY AGAINST ANTI-SECCESSION LEGISLATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 11 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) continues to solicit support from all sectors of society around
Taiwan to take part in a nationwide demonstration set for March 26 to
vehemently oppose Beijing's proposed anti-secession law, DPP Chairman
Su Tseng-chang said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Su called for people of all ages and walks of life to take part
in the rally to say "no" in a democratic way to the anti-secession
law targeting Taiwan. The anti-secession law is expected to be
enacted by the Chinese National People's Congress at its ongoing
annual session which closes March 14.
</P>
<P>
Su visited several private groups Friday to try to broaden the
support base for the DPP-initiated nationwide rally, in which some
500,000 people, including President Chen Shui-bian and former
President Lee Teng-hui, are expected to participate.
</P>
<P>
Among the business executives that Su also visited Friday was
Taiwan Federation of Industry Chairman Lee Cheng-chia, who said that
members of his federation will throw their support behind the ruling
DPP in its efforts to lead the Taiwan people to oppose the law, which
allows "non-peaceful means" to be used should Taiwan move toward
independence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lai Ching-teh, a DPP whip at the Legislative Yuan,
said that the DPP caucus will soon initiate an endorsement drive
calling for support from leaders of parties from across Taiwan's
political spectrum for the March 26 nationwide "Defend Taiwan, Oppose
Annexation" rally.
</P>
<P>
Lai said it is hoped that opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien
Chan, People First Party Chairman James Soong and Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU) Chairman Su Chin-chiang will lead their supporters to
take part in the rally to reflect the truth that all the 23 million
people in Taiwan are determinedly opposed to the anti-secession law
which he said aims to unilaterally change Taiwan's future.
</P>
<P>
He further said that the DPP legislative caucus will also
initiate a resolution soon to ask all party leaders to take part in a
leadership summit to jointly craft countermeasures against enactment
of the anti-secession law.
</P>
<P>
The March 26 nationwide demonstration will be the largest-ever
that the Taiwan people hold to say "no" to China, Lai added.
</P>
<P>
DPP Secretary-General Lee Yi-yang issued a statement earlier this
week saying that the rally will be held based on "three ifs, " namely
"if the anti-secession law stipulates punishment, persecution or
extradition of Taiwan people; if it allows sanctions, boycotts or the
use of violent methods to change the cross-strait status quo; or if
it threatens the existence of the Taiwan people, sabotages the basis
of Taiwan's democracy and freedom, or hurts the nation's basic
interests."
</P>
<P>
Lee pointed out that the tensions in cross-strait relations lie
in Beijing's refusal to recognize the sovereignty of Taiwan, its
threat of force and deployment of missiles which threaten the peace
and security of the Taiwan Strait, and its harsh methods used to
squeeze Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The anti-secession law will only make the problem worse, Lee
said, urging Beijing to reflect upon its policy toward Taiwan and not
to further hurt the feelings of the Taiwan people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, during a session at the Legislative Yuan Friday, TSU
legislators called for President Chen to immediately initiate a
nationwide referendum to demonstrate the Taiwan people's relentless
determination in opposing China's attempts at annexation.
</P>
<P>
Also responding to DPP lawmakers' appeals, KMT Legislator Kuo
Su-chun said that the KMT party members and their supporters would be
happy to take part in the March 26 rally if the DPP could prepare
500,000 Republic of China national flags for the people attending the
rally.

U.S. HOPES TAIWAN CAN ACT WITH RESTRAINT REGARDING ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington, March 10 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A ranking official of the U.S. Defense
Department said Thursday that he hopes Taiwan can "act with
restraint" in responding to China's anti-secession law.
</P>
<P>
Peter W. Rodman, assistant secretary of defense for international
security affairs, made the comments while responding to questions
raised by a reporter from Taiwan's CTI TV News Channel.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese National People's Congress is expected to pass the
anti-secession bill into law at its current annual plenary session
being held in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Rodman also said that the United States does not think that what
Beijing has done regarding the law is a "constructive step."
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he expressed the hope that Taiwan will not
overreact to the matter. "We hope our friends on Taiwan will act with
restraint. We should consult on this," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld declined to
respond to Taiwan reporters' questions the same day regarding the
anti-secession law, saying that he has not seen the law nor been
briefed on the matter and that it is better for the U.S. State
Department to talk about the relevant issues.

PREMIER HAS YET TO DECIDE ON REPLACEMENT OF YUNLIN COUNTY CHIEF
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 11 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh has yet to decide on a
replacement to serve out the remainder of Yunlin County Magistrate
Chang Jung-wei's term following Chang's conviction in a speakership
election bribery case, Cabinet spokesman Cho Jung-tai said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Cho was commenting on media reports that the central government
has contacted former Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Su
Chih-fen from the southwestern county of Yunlin to ask her whether
she is interested in filling the vacancy.
</P>
<P>
Cho said the report is not true, insisting that Premier Hsieh is
unlikely to handle the matter before the Ministry of the Interior
(MOI) receives the Supreme Court's final ruling on the vote-buying
case.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court handed down its ruling for Chang Thursday,
sentencing him to 12 months in jail for his involvement in the 1994
Yunlin County Council speakership election bribery case.
</P>
<P>
According to current regulations, the MOI must relieve a local
government chief of his or her duties if he or she is handed a prison
sentence that cannot be suspended or commuted into a fine.
</P>
<P>
As there are less than two years remaining in Chang's term, no
by-election has to be held to elect a successor. Instead, the Cabinet
is authorized by law to name a replacement to serve out the remainder
of the term.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Chang has already been suspended and detained since last
December for his alleged involvement in the corruption scandal. His
deputy is now acting as Yunlin county magistrate. However, the law
requires Chang's deputy, a political appointee, to be relieved of his
duties along with Chang.
</P>
<P>
Cho said once the MOI receives the Supreme Court ruling, it will
refer a short list of candidates to the premier to choose a preferred
replacement. Cho said the replacement will be announced before the
end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Besides Su, two other DPP politicians -- Lin Kuo-hua and Kao
Meng-ting -- have also expressed a keen interest in securing the
post. Whoever becomes the acting county chief is expected to gain an
edge in the year-end magistrate election.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the legislative caucus of the DPP's "pan-green" ally
-- the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) -- suggested that TSU
Secretary-General Chen Chien-ming, a former legislator, be named
acting Yunlin county magistrate.
</P>
<P>
TSU legislative whip Lo Chih-ming said he has presented the
proposal to Premier Hsieh.
</P>
<P>
Lo quoted Hsieh as having said that so long as DPP Chairman Su
Tseng-chang and TSU Chairman Su Chin-chiang can come to terms on the
proposal, he would name Chen to serve out the remainder of Chang's
term.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that Chen is well known throughout the country, Lo said
he is a perfect replacement for the post.
</P>
<P>
"With three DPP hopefuls vying for the post, naming Chen as
acting Yunlin magistrate could be the best strategy to prevent the
'pan-green' camp from splitting and guarantee a victory in the
year-end election," Lo claimed.
</P>
<P>
After learning of Lo's statement, Premier Hsieh denied that he
has ever promised to have Chen serve in the post.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh stressed that he has yet to consider the replacement issue
and is unlikely to make such a promise as quoted by Lo. "How could I
make any promise before the MOI comes up with a comprehensive report
about the issue?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he is determined to run for the Yunlin magistrate post
in the year-end election regardless of whether Hsieh names him as
acting magistrate or not. Chen, a Taipei City resident, said he will
move his legal abode to Yunlin County next Tuesday to qualify for
running in the year-end election.
</P>
<P>
There have also been reports that top government authorities
prefer to have incumbent Cabinet Secretary-General Lee Ying-yun, a
Yunlin County native, named as the acting Yunlin magistrate. Lee said
that he is pleased with his current job and that his current priority
is assisting the premier in pushing the opposition-controlled
Legislative Yuan to pass five critical bills, including the massive
arms procurement package and the government restructuring plan.
</P>
<P>
While fielding questions at a Legislative Yuan plenary session,
Premier Hsieh also said that he will not name Lee as acting Yunlin
County chief becasue he badly needs Lee assistance at the moment.

MAC TO WORK OUT COUNTERMEASURES AGAINST ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 11 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) will
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of China's anti-secession law and
work out countermeasures after the law's expected enactment next
week, an official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The law, which the National People's Congress of China is
expected to pass at its ongoing annual session which ends Monday,
will authorize Beijing authorities to adopt "non-peaceful means and
other necessary measures" should Taiwan move toward independence.
</P>
<P>
According to MAC Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san, the so-called
"non-peaceful means and other necessary measures" refer not only to
military actions, but also blockades, economic sanctions and
diplomatic suppression.
</P>
<P>
In light of the lack of a clear definition of what "other
necessary measures" means, the law could seriously impact
cross-Taiwan Strait relations and cross-strait trade and economic
activities, Chiu said.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said one possible example of "non-peaceful means" could be
the cutting off of water supply to Hong Kong by Beijing, which would
disrupt the life and economic activities of the people in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chiu declined to make any comment on the large-scale
demonstration being planned by the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party for March 26 against the enactment of the anti-secession law.
</P>
<P>
However, Chiu urged China to carefully consider the possible
consequences of the law on cross-strait relations and the feelings of
the Taiwan people.

'PAN-BLUE ALLIANCE' COOPERATION URGED IN YEAR-END LOCAL ELECTIONS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 11 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several legislators from the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First
Party (PFP) urged cooperation Friday between the two parties as they
announced their bids for the year-end mayoral and magistrate
elections.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator Lee Chia-chin, in announcing his bid for the
Taipei magistrate spot, said he will follow the party's procedure in
seeking nomination.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that five or six aspirants within the KMT are also keen
on the post and that he had already inquired as to the views of KMT
Chairman Lien Chan, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng and Taipei
Mayor Ma Ying-jeou -- the latter two who concurrently serve as KMT
vice chairmen.
</P>
<P>
According to Lee, Lien encouraged all the aspirants to make
public their intentions and urged cooperation between the KMT and the
PFP to ensure maximum victory in the election.
</P>
<P>
Lee also said he agreed with a proposal by PFP Legislator Chou
Hsi-wei that polls will decide who will come forward to serve as the
joint candidate of the KMT and the PFP in Taipei County.
</P>
<P>
Lee's words came one day after Hakka Affairs Council Chairman Lo
Wen-jia tendered his resignation so that he can concentrate on his 
bid for Taipei magistrate.
</P>
<P>
A KMT spokesman said the schedule for nominating the party's
candidate will remain unchanged and that after it finalize the list,
it will coordinate with the PFP.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chou claimed that he is the top choice in opinion
polls for the position among all the aspirants hoping to run.
</P>
<P>
The public hope for a younger, healthy person with professional
capability to serve the post, he claimed.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that the KMT will present a fair
nomination mechanism and coordinate with the PFP for one joint
candidate.
</P>
<P>
Chou made the remarks in a PFP press conference in which the
party introduced him, as well as legislators Liu Wen-hsiung, Hsu
Yao-chang and Chung Shao-he and former Legislator Hsieh Chang-chieh,
as the party's candidates for Taipei County, Keelung City, Miaoli
County, Kaohsiung County and Changhua County, respectively, in the
year-end elections.
</P>
<P>
Chung said that among the five aspirants, he will run under the
greatest pressure, noting that southern Taiwan is traditionally a
stronghold of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.

BEIJING HOPES TO DISCUSS CHARTER FLIGHTS FOR TOMBSWEEPING DAY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 11 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China's Civil Aviation Association (CAA)
</P>
<P>
has expressed hope that both sides of the Taiwan Strait can start
to discuss charter flight services for the Tombsweeping Day period
based on the same model used for the Chinese New Year holiday.
</P>
<P>
CAA Executive Director Pu Zhaozhou sent a letter to Michael Lo,
head of the Taipei Airlines Association (TAA) Friday outlining his
desire for talks on the subject.
</P>
<P>
TAA Secretary-General Su Hsien-jung said the TAA immediately
notified the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) -- the top charter of the
nation's China policy -- of the letter and was waiting for the MAC to
decide whether it will commission the TAA to discuss the matter with
its Beijing counterpart.
</P>
<P>
Pu and Lo, on behalf of each side of the Taiwan Strait, completed
discussions on the charter flights during Chinese New Year holiday in
early January, and adopted the model of joint-participation of air
carriers on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, as well as two-way
flights without stops in Hong Kong or Macau.
</P>
<P>
Su said that although the New Year charter flights were quite
successful, it was an isolated case and that if both sides intend to
promote charter flights during the Tombsweeping Day period, new
discussions will be needed.
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition People First Party said it "would be
better to slow down" on discussing cross-strait charter flights at
this moment.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chih-ping, PFP caucus whip in the legislature, said that as
China will soon enact an "anti-secession law" targeting Taiwan, it
would be "a bit strange" for both sides to discuss the charter
flights issue.

CANADA OPPOSES UNILATERAL MOVE THAT COULD CHANGE TAIWAN'S STATUS: FM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Ottawa,  March 10 (CNA)

<TEXT>
<P>
Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Pierre
Pettigrew reiterated Thursday that the government of Canada opposes
unilateral moves taken by either side of the Taiwan Strait that could
change Taiwan's status, build up cross-Taiwan Strait tension and
affect political stability and economic prosperity in East Asia.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question raised at the Canadian Parliament by Don
Boudria, a leader of the Canadian Reform Conservative Alliance, who
asked Pettigrew whether Canada is taking a similar stance as the
United States on Beijing's enactment of an anti-secession law
targeting Taiwan, Pettigrew said that how China's National People's
Congress is processing the proposed law is unknown yet, but he added
that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will try to gain further
understanding of the law once it is passed and publicized.
</P>
<P>
Boudria, who is also chairman of the parliamentarian
Taiwan-Canada Friendship Association, said during an interpellation
session that Washington has recently voiced its opposition to
Beijing's enactment of the proposed law, which would provide Beijing
with a legal basis to adopt "non-peaceful means" to resolve
cross-strait problems if it thinks Taiwan is making moves toward
independence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Stockwell Day, a spokesman for the Canadian Reform
Conservative Alliance, said during the interpellation session that
the Chinese communist regime's expected enactment of the proposed
anti-secession law once again reveals Beijing's attempts to invade
Taiwan and its intention of taking Taiwan by force.
</P>
<P>
Day claimed that when what he described as Taiwan's "allies" such
as the United States and Japan, have spoken loudly to express their
concerns over a democracy infringed upon by totalitarians, Canada
should also render its support to Taiwan.

TSU UNVEILS DRAFT OF 'ANTI-ANNEXATION LAW'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 11 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The pro-independence opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) unveiled Friday a draft of an "anti-annexation
law" designed to counter an anti-secession law that China is expected
to pass next week.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft, in the event of the cross-Taiwan Strait
status quo being at stake, the government should take steps such as
calling a referendum and amending the Constitution to safeguard the
sovereignty of Taiwan, and can resort to non-peaceful means to resist
China's annexation.
</P>
<P>
TSU Chairman Shu Chin-chiang pointed out that the anti-secession
law, which will authorize the Beijing authorities to use non-peaceful
means should Taiwan move toward independence, will pave the way for
military action against the island and will jeopardize cross-strait
security and peace in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Shu urged the United States and Japan to take concrete action
against the imminent threat posed by China.
</P>
<P>
The draft states that Taiwan has existed alongside China since
the foundation of the People's Republic of China on Oct. 1, 1949,
with the status quo being that the two sides are independent of each
other and have no jurisdiction over each other.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is already an independent, sovereign state and it is not
an issue for Taiwan to declare independence or seek separation from
China, the draft says.
</P>
<P>
It says Taiwan and China must respect the fact of their existing
alongside each other and negotiate with each other on an equal
footing in order to resolve their differences, adding that the
Beijing-proposed "one country, two systems" format for unification is
unacceptable to the people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan and China should maintain peace and stability across the
strait and respect each other's independence and autonomy in terms of
domestic and foreign affairs, it says.
</P>
<P>
The draft says the two sides should expand their economic and
cultural exchanges to enhance mutual understanding and trust, and
proposes that a cross-strait military confidence-building mechanism
and code of conduct be set up to protect regional peace and
stability.

TAIWAN BAR ASSOCIATION VOICES OUTCRY OVER ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 11 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Taiwan Bar Association issued a public
statement Friday calling for China to pull back on its enactment of
an anti-secession law targeting Taiwan "before it's too late."
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Bar Association, which groups some 4,000 lawyers
practicing in Taiwan, urged the Chinese communist regime not to enact
the proposed law to avoid undermining an atmosphere that is conducive
to accelerating cross-Taiwan Strait engagement and shun actions that
will lead both sides of the strait to a mutually destructive
doomsday.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan lawyers said that after failing to push its
"pro-unification, anti-independence" scheme, Beijing authorized its
State Council and Central Military Commission to take Taiwan by
"non-peaceful means" if it thinks Taiwan is making moves toward
independence.
</P>
<P>
This pre-emptive plot will change the cross-strait status quo
unilaterally and also hurts the feelings of the people of Taiwan, the
statement says, adding that the law also infringes upon the Taiwan
people's rights to survival and autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Warning that the proposed anti-secession law will curtail Taiwan
people's pursuit of democracy, freedom and human rights, the Taiwan
Bar Association said it will initiate a petition among all bar
associations around Taiwan soon to express their indignation with and
disdain for Beijing over the anti-secession legislation.
</P>
<P>
The association will also seek support from its counterparts in
the international community, as well as international human rights
bodies, according to the statement.

JAPAN'S VISA WAIVER FOR TAIWAN TOURISTS COMES INTO FORCE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Tokyo,  March  11 (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Japan's visa waiver for tourists from
Taiwan during the Aichi World Exposition came into force Friday, with
the arrival of 151 Taiwan visitors in the northern Japanese island of
Hokkaido via a China Airlines charter plane.
</P>
<P>
They were the first group of Taiwan tourists to enjoy the
visa-free privilege.
</P>
<P>
Japanese public television channel NHK footage showed an arriving
Taiwan tourist who said the people of Taiwan generally welcome
Japan's visa waiver.
</P>
<P>
A Taiwan tour guide told an NHK reporter that he believes the
visa-free privilege will help boost the number of Taiwan visitors to
Japan by 20 percent to 30 percent this year. The number of Taiwan
tourists to Japan broke the 1 million mark for the first time last
year.
</P>
<P>
With a view to attracting more foreign visitors to the
eco-friendly world exposition to be held in the central Japanese
prefecture of Aichi March 25-Sept. 25, Japan passed regulations in
February to waive the visa requirements for Taiwan tourists between
March 11 and Sept. 25.
</P>
<P>
During the period, Taiwan passport holders can enter Japan
without visas for sightseeing purposes for a maximum 90-day stay.
</P>
<P>
Japanese government officials said they will also consider
whether to offer Taiwan citizens permanent visa-free privileges after
the Aichi World Exposition.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is Japan's second-largest source of foreign tourists after
South Korea. Japan began to offer similar visa waivers to South
Korean citizens early this month.

NORMAL CROSS-STRAIT CHARTER FLIGHTS NEEDS NEGOTIATION: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  11 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Friday that
opening of normal charter flights across the Taiwan Strait is
"possible in principle" if both sides can shelf their differences and
meet for talks.
</P>
<P>
Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, Hsieh said that
although the exchanges of "two-way, non-stop" passenger charter
flights across the Taiwan Strait during the Chinese New Year holiday
had some shortcomings, they created a favorable basis upon which the
two sides could continue to talk about expanding the program to make
it available during three other major Chinese festivals --
Tombsweeping Day, Dragon Festival and Moon Festival -- in the
following year.
</P>
<P>
Opposition lawmakers raised the topic of cross-strait charter
flights Friday after Pu Zhaozhou, executive director of China's Civil
Aviation Association expressed hope that both sides of the Taiwan
Strait can start to discuss charter flight services for the
Tombsweeping Day period based on the same model used for the Chinese
New Year holiday.
</P>
<P>
Pu sent a letter to Michael Lo, head of the Taipei Airlines
Association (TAA) Friday outlining his desire for talks on the
subject.

GOVERNMENT URGED NOT TO TALK WITH BEIJING ON CHARTER FLIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 11 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) said Friday that the government should put talks on
cross-strait charter flights during the Tombsweeping Day period on
hold and should reassess its China policy overall.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chin-chun, whip of the DPP legislative caucus, made the
remarks after Pu Zhaozhou, executive director of China Civil
Aviation Association, sent a letter to Michael Lo, head of the Taipei
Airlines Association, earlier Friday inviting him to discuss the
charter flights during Tombsweeping Day period based on the same
model used for the Chinese New Year Holiday.
</P>
<P>
Pu and Lo, on behalf of each side of the Taiwan Strait, completed
discussion on the charter flights during Chinese New Year holiday in
early January, in which the model of joint-participation of air
carriers on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, as well as two-way
flights without stops in Hong Kong or Macau, was adopted.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that the successful launch of cross-strait charter
flights during the Chinese New Year holiday should be conducive to
the easing of cross-strait relations, but the good atmosphere
has not stopped China from putting aside its legislation of its
proposed "anti-secession law" targeting at Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He said that China threatens "non-peaceful means" against Taiwan
in the proposed law, but the law also stipulates that it will
encourage and promote cross-strait economic exchanges and
cooperation, establish direct trade, postal and transportation links
and closer economic relations for mutual benefits.
</P>
<P>
Chen described Beijing's talk about charter flights during the
Tombsweeping Day period as a "carrot and stick" approach that he said
lacks true goodwill.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties were also lukewarm about talks on the
Tombsweeping charter flights, with the main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) saying that the government should deal with it with wisdom.
</P>
<P>
KMT spokesman Chang Jung-kung claimed that Beijing made the offer
because its proposed "anti-secession law" has caused revulsion among
the Taiwan people and because the DPP has put a hold on the promotion
of cross-strait exchanges such as cargo charter flights, so that
Beijing has to extend an olive branch.
</P>
<P>
Chang said the United States was positive about cross-strait
charter flights during the Chinese New Year holiday and claimed that
if Taiwan cannot agree to such services for Tombsweeping Day, the
United States could apply pressure to the DPP government.
</P>
<P>
The KMT's ally, the People First Party, said it "would be better
to slow down" on discussing cross-trait charter flights at present.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chih-ping, whip of the PFP caucus in the Legislative Yuan,
said that because of the anti-secession law, it would be "a bit
strange" for the two sides to discuss the charter flight issue.
</P>
<P>
The pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) said it
opposes the flights.
</P>
<P>
Lo Chih-ming, whip of the TSU caucus in the legislature, said the
party is opposed to charter flight service on various festive days,
claiming that the service is an attempt to accomplish the
normalization of direct flights.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the anti-secession law is like a big stick aimed at
Taiwan, and the island should not kowtow to China. Until Beijing
responds with goodwill, Taiwan should not be over-enthusiastic, he
said.

Earlier in the day, the possibility of the government making its

PREMIER DEFENDS DPP-INITIATED RALLY AGAINST ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  11 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh defended a ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) plan to organize a huge rally to
protest China's anti-secession law aimed at Taiwan, saying that
opposition parties should not give the cold shoulder to the planned
rally.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the remarks in response to questions from DPP
Legislator Lee Chun-Yi during a general interpellation session of the
Legislative Yuan. Lee asked the premier to express his viewpoint on
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou's recent remarks that the DPP's plan to
stage a demonstration against the law is a provocative action. Ma
serves concurrently as a vice chairman of the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT).
</P>
<P>
"It is not Taiwan that is taking the initiative in arousing so
much dispute over the so-called anti-secession law, " Hsieh said,
adding that now is an opportune chance for the people of Taiwan to
let the international community understand that Taiwan is not a
"tension-maker."
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the planned rally will show the international
community that Taiwan is a democracy- and peace-loving country, Hsieh
said the people of Taiwan will be considered numb if they show no
reaction to China's proposed law.
</P>
<P>
China's rubber-stamp parliament -- the National People's Congress
(NPC) -- began Tuesday to screen the bill, which provides the legal
basis for China's use of non-peaceful means against Taiwan in certain
situations, and is expected to pass it next week.
</P>
<P>
In response, the DPP is planning to stage a rally in Taipei March
26. DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang called on all sectors of society
Friday to take part in the demonstration to vehemently oppose the
legislation. Around 500,000 people, including President Chen
Shui-bian and former President Lee Teng-hui, are expected to
participate.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council have
said that the law is tantamount to a "blank check" authorizing the
Chinese military to use force against Taiwan, and accused Beijing of
jeopardizing peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lai Ching-teh, a DPP whip at the Legislative Yuan,
said that the DPP caucus will soon initiate an endorsement drive
calling for support from leaders of parties from across Taiwan's
political spectrum for the March 26 anti-annexation rally.
</P>
<P>
Lai said it is hoped that KMT Chairman Lien Chan, People First
Party Chairman James Soong and Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) Chairman
Su Chin-chiang will lead their supporters to take part in the rally
to reflect the truth that all the 23 million people in Taiwan are
determinedly opposed to the anti-secession law, which he said aims to
unilaterally change Taiwan's future.
</P>
<P>
China still considers the island part of its territory despite
their split in 1949 after a civil war. Beijing has repeatedly
threatened to use force against Taiwan if the island declare
independence.

TAIWAN EXPORTS TO MAINLAND CHINA FLOCK TO CENTRAL REGION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  11 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan exports to mainland China are
increasingly going to Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces in the central
part of the country, with the two provinces accounting for nearly 60
percent of Taiwan's mainland-bound shipments last year, according to
government tallies released Friday.
</P>
<P>
The statistics made public by the Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT)
under the Ministry of Economic Affairs show that along with rapidly
growing Taiwan investment in central mainland China, Taiwan exports
to Jiangsu and Zhejiang accounted for 58.3 percent of the country's
total outbound shipments to the mainland in 2004.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 43.3 percent of Taiwan investment went to Jiangsu,
while 28.9 percent and 8.5 percent went to Guangdong and Fujian
provinces, respectively, BOFT tallies show. Zhejiang Province took
6.6 percent. At the same time, 54.8 percent of Taiwan's total exports
to mainland China were shipped to Jiangsu, while 30.9 percent went to
Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
In terms of product category, 85.5 percent of optical exports and
47.3 percent and 27.7 percent of chemical goods exports were shipped
to Jiangsu and Zhejiang, respectively.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 percent of other Taiwan exports bound for the
mainland, such as electrical engineering, machinery, rubber, steel,
man-made fiber products, were also destined for Jiangsu and
Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
According to BOFT officials, mainland-bound exports from Asian
neighbors, including Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia,
Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines have also increasingly
focused on the central region rather than the southern region, with
Jiangsu outpacing other provinces.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh urged Taiwan
businesses to exercise greater caution with regard to their
investments in the mainland at a time when Beijing's anti-secession
law aimed at Taiwan is expected to be approved next week.
</P>
<P>
Ho made the remarks Thursday at an economic forum while giving a
keynote speech on cross-strait economic development and strategies.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that it is undeniable that Taiwan investment in
mainland China has benefited Taiwan, Ho nevertheless called on Taiwan
companies to take political factors into consideration while weighing
investment plans in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Ho said her ministry will retain its current mainland China
investment rules for the time being until after the national security
authorities hammer out an assessment on the fragile cross-Taiwan
Strait situation.
</P>
<P>
A very strict mainland China investment policy is very likely to
erode Taiwan companies' competitive edge in other countries, as many
of them have relocated to the mainland and are dedicated to
export-oriented business, she added.

CHARTER CARGO FLIGHTS SHOULD TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER PASSENGER LINKS: MAC
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The government will have to assess the
value of launching direct charter passenger flights across the Taiwan
Strait during the upcoming Tomb-sweeping Day holiday in the face of
Beijing's proposed "anti-secession" legislation, an official said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san made
the remarks after China's Civil Aviation Association (CAA) expressed
the hope earlier in the day that both sides of the Taiwan Strait
could start discussing the opening of cross-strait charter flight
services during the Tomb-sweeping Day period based on the same model
used for the just-concluded Chinese Lunar New Year holiday.
</P>
<P>
CAA Executive Director Pu Zhaozhou sent a letter to Michael Lo,
head of the Taipei Airlines Association (TAA) Friday outlining his
desire for talks on the matter. TAA Secretary-General Su Hsien-jun
said Pu's message has been conveyed to the MAC, which charts Taiwan's
cross-strait policy.
</P>
<P>
While Beijing's figurehead parliament is screening the so-called
"anti-secession" bill targeting Taiwan, Chiu said it's hypocritical
for the CAA to propose talks on the flights now.
</P>
<P>
As the Tomb-sweeping Day holiday lasts for a couple of days, Chiu
said, the opening of direct cross-strait charter flights during the
would not contribute any to bilateral commercial exchanges.
</P>
<P>
In his view, Chiu said, the opening of cross-strait cargo flights
would have far more positive effects on economic development on both
sides of the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said if Beijing is sincere in promoting constructive
cross-strait engagements and maintaining regional stability, it
should scrap its "anti-secession" legislation plan and give priority
to negotiating the launch of direct cross-strait charter cargo
flights to meet market demand.
</P>
<P>
Tomb-sweeping Day, which falls on April 5, is one of the most
important festivals in Chinese society.
</P>
<P>
Under a landmark deal reached in January, six carriers from each
side of the Taiwan Strait were allowed to operate a total of 48
direct, non-stop charter flights between Taipei/Kaohsiung and
Shanghai/Guangzhou/Beijing during the Chinese Lunar New Year period
to facilitate the return of Taiwan business people operating on the
mainland for holiday celebrations.
</P>

ARMS PURCHASE WILL DETER CHINA'S INVASION OF TAIWAN: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 11 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Friday that the
government's proposed NT$610.8 billion (US$18.23 billion) arms
procurement package from the United States will deter a Chinese
attack of Taiwan because China "is bound to lose."
</P>
<P>
However, failure to acquire the weapons will tilt the military
balance across the Taiwan Strait in China's favor, Hsieh warned.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the remarks during an interpellation session in the
Legislative Yuan ahead of the expected enactment of an
"anti-secession law" by China, which will authorize the Beijing
authorities to use non-peaceful means should Taiwan move towards
independence.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet has been lobbying the legislature to support an
expensive budget proposal for the procurement of six Patriot PAC-III
anti-missile batteries, eight diesel-electric submarines and a
squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft from the United States.
</P>
<P>
According to Minister of National Defense Lee Jye, the side on
the offensive will be certain to win if its has three times the
strength of the deffense and
the result will be uncertain if it has only two times the strength of
the defense. 
</P>
<P>
If the ratio between the strenthes is lower than "1.5, " the side
on the defensive will be certain to win, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
While the current ratio of military strength between China and
Taiwan is 1.46, the it will increase significantly to 2.87 between
2020 and 2035 if Taiwan does not buy new weapons to maintain its
defense capabilities against China's continued military buildup, Lee
said.
</P>
<P>
The arms procurement will slow down the rate of increase and keep
the ratio at 1.67, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said China is not going to launch an attack of
Taiwan now because the chances of success are meager.

TAIWAN TO SEEK U. S. UNDERSTANDING REGARDING MARCH 26 PROTEST
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 11 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government will make its stance fully
known to the United States and other friendly countries regarding a
large protest planned by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) against Beijing's "anti-secession" law, Premier Frank Hsieh
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the remarks while fielding questions from DPP lawmaker
Julian J. Kuo, who asked the premier whether the government is ready
to explain Taiwan's stance to the United States, as Washington has
called on both sides to refrain from emotional actions in order not
to fuel tensions across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
According to Hsieh, he personally expects all the people in
Taiwan to take part in the demonstration set for March 26 in Taipei.
Since it is a rally hoped for by the private sector, the government
will try to seek understanding and support from the United States and
other friendly countries for such an activity to counter Beijing's
intimidation.
</P>
<P>
The DPP hopes that at least 500,000 people will take to the
streets.
</P>
<P>
The National People's Congress, Beijing's ceremonial parliament,
is anticipated to pass the "anti-secession" legislation next week to
prevent Taiwan from edging toward independence. The law is expected
to include provisions to allow Beijing to deal with Taiwan with
"non-peaceful" means.
</P>
<P>
DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang announced a day earlier that the
party will organize a large protest against Beijing in view of its
"anti-secession" legislation aimed at Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration will be peaceful to underscore the strong
desire of the Taiwan people to protect democratic values and their
lifestyles, Su said.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Su's call, Hsieh urged Beijing later the same day to
treasure Taiwan's middle-road efforts after President Chen Shui-bian
met People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong late last month and
issued a 10-point joint statement pledging to maintain the national
moniker of the Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Both sides of the strait should engage in peace-making for mutual
benefits, he said.
</P>
<P>
Many pro-independence organizations, including the Taiwan
Solidarity Union, a political ally of the DPP, have showed
willingness to take part in the activity in a gesture of solidarity
with the DPP.
</P>
<P>
They blasted that the enactment of the law is tantamount to
writing a blank check for Beijing to invade Taiwan at any time and
called it clear proof of Beijing's plot to change the cross-strait
status quo and to dictate Taiwan's future by force despite the olive
branches extended by President Chen.
</P>
<P>
According to a PFP spokesman, Soong will not participate in the
March 26 protest. He also urged both Taiwan and mainland China not to
breach the good opportunity to forge rapport now at a time when
bilateral ties have showed initial signals of improvement in the wake
of the lunar new year charter flights.

TAIPEI MAYOR TO CALL NEWS CONFERENCE ON 'ANTI-SECESSION' LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 11 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou is scheduled to
call an international news conference March 14 to express his
opposition to China's "anti-secession" law aimed at Taiwan, a Taipei
City Government official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Yu Tzu-hsiang, director of the Information Department, said that
China's rubber-stamp parliament -- the National People's Congress --
is expected to pass an "anti-secession" bill next Monday morning to
provide the legal basis for China's use of non-peaceful means against
the island in certain situations.
</P>
<P>
All county magistrates and mayors from the ruling and opposition
parties will be invited to attend the planned news conference, during
which Ma will strongly protest Beijing's "anti-secession"
law targeting Taiwan, Yu pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Yu went on to say that all local government chiefs present at the
news conference will sign a joint protest letter that will be sent to
international media organizations. He said that he hopes that this
will help Taiwan obtain support from more foreign countries for the
island's opposition to this "anti-secession" law.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, acting Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai called on Ma to
take part in a ruling Democratic Progressive Party-initiated
anti-annexation rally slated for March 26.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that the planned rally offers a good chance for all
different ethnic groups and supporters from across the political
spectrum to show their determination to defend Taiwan and oppose
annexation by China.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council have
said that the law is tantamount to a blank check authorizing the
Chinese military to use force against Taiwan, and accused Beijing of
jeopardizing peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
China still considers the island part of its territory despite
their split in 1949 after a civil war. Beijing has repeatedly
threatened to use force against Taiwan if the island declares
independence.

INTER-PARTY TALKS ON NEW '319 TRUTH COMMISSION' BREAK DOWN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 11 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The legislative caucuses of the ruling and
opposition parties failed to reach agreement Friday on the
re-organizing of a special commission to investigate the
assassination attempt on President Chen Shui-bian last March,
commonly known as the "319 shooting."
</P>
<P>
The caucuses also failed to come to terms on the opposition
People First Party-initiated (PFP) proposal that a new special
commission be formed to scrutinize all records documenting the
procedures of law enforcement authorities' investigation into the
mysterious "319 shooting."
</P>
<P>
The opposition-controlled fifth Legislative Yuan passed a special
statute authorizing the establishment of an independent "319 truth
commission" to investigate the case in which President Chen and Vice
President Annette Lu were shot and slightly wounded. However, the
statute was later ruled by the Council of Grand Justices (CGJ) to be
unconstitutional. According to the CGJ's interpretation, the
commission's tenure expired with the expiration of the fifth
legislature at the end of January this year.
</P>
<P>
The opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and
the PFP continues to control a slim majority in the current
legislature and intends to re-organize the "319 truth commission" to
probe the incident.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Ker Chien-ming, who concurrently heads the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) policy coordination department,
said the legislature should give priority to revising the "319"
special statute to pave the way for the formation of a viable and
legal "319 truth commission."
</P>
<P>
As to the PFP proposal to form a commission to review records
regarding law enforcement units' procedures regarding the "319
shooting" investigations, Ker said it's extremely inappropriate for
the legislature to form such a commission at the moment.
</P>
<P>
"Police and prosecution authorities are still probing the case.
It's inappropriate for the legislature to review relevant documents
at present because such moves would interfere with the exercise of
judicial powers," Ker said.
</P>
<P>
It remains unclear when legislative caucuses from across the
political spectrum will hold inter-party consultations on the issue.
</P>
<P>
President Chen and Vice President Lu were slightly wounded March
19, 2004 when two homemade bullets grazed them as they campaigned in
an open jeep in the southern city of Tainan. After the Chen-Lu ticket
narrowly won re-election the following day, the sole challenging
ticket of KMT Chairman Lien Chan and PFP Chairman James Soong accused
the president of having staged the shooting to win sympathy votes and
filed two lawsuits to challenge the election result. The shooting is
believed to have gravely aggravated hostility between the ruling and
opposition camps.
</P>
<P>
The special police team investigating the incident identified
Chen Yi-hsiung, 63, as the key suspect in the "319 shooting" Monday
after several months of tracking down numerous clues. Chen Yi-hsiung
was found dead in Anping Harbor in Tainan March 29 last year -- 10
days after the shooting -- in what police have said was an apparent
suicide.
</P>
<P>
Lin Teh-hua, deputy commissioner of the Criminal Investigation
Bureau (CIB) , said Friday that pegging Chen Yi-hsiung as the "319"
gunman was not "wild speculation" even though the investigative team
has so far failed to secure direct evidence proving its assumption.
</P>
<P>
"The bullets and various prior owners of the gun alleged to have
been used in the shooting, the footage of security tapes at the crime
scene and testimonies of the man's family members all showed that
Chen Yi-hsiung was the most likely suspect," Lin said.
</P>
<P>
Lin said the team is still working hard in hopes of recovering
the homemade pistol used in the shooting. He clarified that the team
has never set the upcoming March 19 anniversary as the deadline to
solve or close the case as media has reported.
</P>
<P>
"We'll continue looking into the case regardless of how difficult
it may be," Lin said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Liu Wei-chung, a Tainan chief prosecutor and a member
of the investigative team, reiterated that Chen Yi-hsiung's family
members are all free and have not been subject to any restrictions in
movement and communications. After one-and-a-half days of dredging
in the Anping Harbor where Chen Yi-hsiung's body was found,
investigators have failed to find the gun allegedly used by the
suspect. Investigators said they will not search the area again
unless there are new leads or information. Instead, the team will
focus on several other possible locations.

<TEXT>
<P>
An extraordinary session of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) National Congress will be opened
Saturday, two days before China's National People's Congress is
expected to pass an "anti-secession" law aimed at Taiwan next Monday.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian is scheduled to deliver a keynote speech
at the session, during which the DPP will pass a draft statute
governing the nomination of candidates for the mission-oriented
National Assembly elections slated for May 14, a DPP official said.
</P>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh and DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang will also
attend and deliver speeches at the session, the main theme of which
will be "Persist in Reforms, Defend Taiwan, " the official went on.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the closing of its national congress special session,
the official pointed out, the DPP will issue a statement expressing
its strong opposition to Beijing's "anti-secession" law and its
determination to safeguard Taiwan's sovereignty and to push for
constitutional reforms.
</P>
<P>
According to a DPP preliminary plan, the party will nominate
around 150 candidates for the mission-oriented National Assembly
elections. A total of 300 delegates will be elected exclusively for
the task of reviewing the constitutional amendment proposals passed
by the Legislative Yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
The legislature passed several constitutional amendment proposals
at an extraordinary session last August, including the halving of the
number of seats in the current 225-seat legislature, the adoption of
a "single seat, two votes" electoral system for the legislature, the
abrogation of the National Assembly, and the inclusion of the
referendum right into the Constitution.

GOVERMENT'S REPORT WARNS OF CHINA'S RAPID INDUSTRIAL UPGRADING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  11 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China is upgrading and adjusting its
industrial structure to better its competitiveness, a situation that
could find China overtaking Taiwan in eight years or less in
manufacturing technologies, the Industrial Development Bureau (IDB)
under the Ministry of Economic Affairs reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The bureau identified the electronics sector as being the most
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
The IDB research was aimed at forecasting the competitiveness of
Taiwan products against those from the mainland in the international
market through analysis of U.S., Japanese and European Union
statistics on trade, as well as relevant statistics released by the
governments of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Through the research, the bureau build an indicator regarding
cross-strait industrial development, a system to forecast the export
growth rate, and an economic impact indicator.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, in 2003, Taiwan's largest exports were
in the manufacturing sector of electronic parts and components,
Accounting for 19.25 percent of all of the country's exports. The
second largest export item, at 19.14 percent that year, was from the
computer telecommunications and video and audio electronic production
sector.
</P>
<P>
The figures were not very much different from those in 1993, the
report said, indicating, however, that the ratio of mainland exports
from these two sectors to the whole surged from 6.91 percent to 24.27
percent during the 10-year period, while that regarding the food and
textile sectors declined from 20.84 percent to 12.38 percent.
</P>
<P>
The numbers showed China's electronic sector is expanding at a
speed that might threaten Taiwan's industrial competitiveness, an IDB
official said.

<P>
Taipei City Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said
Saturday he might not take part in the March 26 rally organized by
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to protest China's
"anti-secession" law targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Ma said he would join the chiefs of various counties and cities
from around Taiwan in decrying the law in a news conference for
foreign journalists March 14 when the law is expected to be passed by
the National People's Congress -- China's rubber-stamp parliament.
</P>
<P>
In that news conference, Ma said, he and the local government
chiefs will unveil an open letter to worldwide media to protest the
law and to appeal for international support for Taiwan in its
opposition to the law.
</P>
<P>
"I think that would be enough to show our stance," Ma said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the news conference would be boycotted by DPP
county and city chiefs, Ma said: "I am not worried about it."

CAT, DOG VACCINES IN SUFFICIENT SUPPLY: COA

<P>
The Council of Agriculture (COA) said
Saturday that vaccines for cats and dogs are in sufficient supply and
urged owners to take their pets to the veterinarian to receive their
regular shots.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health
Inspection and Quarantine noted that the government lifted late last
year the ban on imports from the United States of cat and dog
vaccines containing ruminant serum, and that so far, 409,761 doses
have been imported
</P>
<P>
The officials said that in view of the fact that around 70,000
doses on average are used in Taiwan every month, the current supply
should be sufficient to meet demand for the first half of the year.
Further imports will come later, they added.
</P>
<P>
They reminded pet owners to take their cats and dogs to
veterinarians to receive vaccinations regularly to ensure the health
of their pets and to avoid diseases that could be contracted by
people also.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan imposed a ban on cat and dog vaccines that contain
ruminant serum in December 2003 in the wake of a case of mad cow
disease in Washington State. Taiwan also banned the import of U.S.

TAIWAN EXPATS IN TORONTO PROTEST AGAINST 'ANTI-SECESSION LAW'
</HEADLINE>

Toronto, March 11 (CNA)
(By Chang Chun-yu and Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly 300 Taiwanese expatriates residing
in Toronto held a rally in the Canadian city Thursday to protest
China's plan to enact an "anti-secession law" targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Holding green banners symbolizing Taiwan, the protesters chanted
slogans such as "One China, One Taiwan!" "China, Hands Off Taiwan!"
"Let Taiwan into the United Nations! " and "Let Taiwan into the World
Health Organization! " as they marched to the Chinese Consulate
General in Toronto to lodge their protest.
</P>
<P>
The protesters stressed that the fate of Taiwan should be
determined by its people and urged the Canadian government to throw
its support behind the island.
</P>
<P>
According to Huang Ta-tun, a leader of the Taiwanese community in
Toronto, Taiwan is a sovereign state independent of the People's
Republic of China, and the "anti-secession law" will be inapplicable
to Taiwan because it is a domestic law of China.
</P>
<P>
Huang called on China to resume dialogue with Taiwan based on the
principle of equality between sovereign nations and seek to resolve
cross-Taiwan Strait differences through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
The "anti-seccession law, " which the National People's Congress
of China is expected to pass next week, authorizes Beijing
authorities to use "non-peaceful means" against Taiwan should the

ANTI-SECESSION LAW ABSURD: MAC
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 12 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) urged
Beijing Saturday not to enact its "anti-secession law," calling it an
absurd law that has stirred up resentment among the people in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that Beijing cannot hide or lessen the absurdity of the
law no matter how hard it tries, the MAC said in a statement that
what matters now for Beijing is to put an end to the legislation in
order to secure peace and the status quo in the Taiwan Strait. It
added that it would be a great mistake for Beijing to go against the
Taiwan people's aspirations for peace.
</P>
<P>
The MAC made it clear that the law has fully exposed Beijing's
hegemonic mindset and paranoid intent to arbitrarily determine
Taiwan's future as seen in the provision that authorizes the use of
"non-peaceful means" in dealing with Taiwan. It pointed out that the
provision is proof that Beijing's calls for peace and exchanges
across the strait are all a lie.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet-level MAC is Taiwan's top agency in charge of
mainland policy planning.
</P>
<P>
MAC Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san said Beijing's insistence on
enacting the law despite the Taiwan people's disapproval is
counterproductive to the fragile cross-strait relations, describing
the latest remarks by a ranking Beijing official on the law as "the
same old lines."
</P>
<P>
Chiu said that the international community will not accept
Beijing's military action against Taiwan and that it is beyond doubt
that Beijing is seeking to unilaterally deny the Republic of China's
sovereignty through the "anti-secession law."
</P>
<P>
Chen Yunlin, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office under
Beijing's State Council, repeated late Friday that the
"anti-secession" legislation is not aimed at the majority of the
Taiwan people, but rather at "a few separatists seeking Taiwan
independence."
</P>
<P>
The National People's Congress, Beijing's ceremonial parliament,
is expected to pass the law before the conclusion of its ongoing
annual session Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Ching-chun, a legislative caucus whip of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), urged leaders of the two sides to
sit down and open peace talks. He said that Beijing should give up
its "anti-secession" legislation if it really wants peace with
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen's counterparts in the People First Party and the Taiwan
Solidarity Union echoed his comments, saying that the law is a scheme
by Beijing to downgrade the ROC and make Taiwan surrender and become
a part of mainland China.
</P>
<P>
To counter Beijing's military intimidation, the ruling DPP is
planning a large-scale protest for March 26 in Taipei. At least half
a million people are expected to take part in the demonstration.

WANG PROMISES PEACEFUL CAMPAIGN IF HE DOES RUN FOR KMT HEAD
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng
said Saturday that he still has to assess over the next few days
whether to run for the Kuomintang (KMT) chairmanship, and that if he
does run for the post, the campaign will be rational and peaceful.
</P>
<P>
The politically-savvy speaker made the remarks while attending a
ceremony marking the establishment of the "Friends of Jin-pyng in
Kaohsiung County" support group in the southern Taiwan county. A
similar group was established in Pingtung County the same day.
</P>
<P>
Wang earlier said that he wants incumbent KMT Chairman Lien Chan
to continue in the post. Lien has yet to publicly announce his
intention to step down, although he has said several times that the
party needs a generational transition.
</P>
<P>
Wang, a legislator for 10 consecutive terms, expressed
appreciation to his supporters, saying that the party, after losses
in the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections, has faced a number of
problems.
</P>
<P>
Feeling the passion of his hometown supporters, Wang said he will
give serious consideration to whether to run for the party's top
post. He said he will consider whether he is fit to serve in the
post, to continue the reforms started by Lien, to integrate the KMT
and its two splinter parties, the New Party and the People First
Party (PFP) , to deal with the controversial issue of the party's
assets, and to inject new blood into the party and make it
"Taiwanese."
</P>
<P>
As cross-strait relations are crucial to the existence and
development of the nation, Wang said, he will consider whether he is
capable of handling cross-strait relations and increasing exchanges
and cooperation with the international community.
</P>
<P>
Amid misgivings within the KMT that the chairmanship election,
which is set for May, might turn into a battle between Wang and
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou -- both of whom are KMT vice chairmen --
and divide the largest opposition party, Wang promised that this
wouldn't be the case.
</P>
<P>
"If I do join the election, the campaign will be rational and
peaceful, " Wang said, adding that the public "will have a "different
look at the party, " and that it will "by no means splinter the
party."
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator Lin Yi-shih said that if the KMT wants to flourish
in southern Taiwan, it will need a chairman from Kaohsiung County.
</P>
<P>
PFP Legislator Chung Shao-he said that Wang's running for the
party chairmanship will only be the beginning. Looking ahead to the
2008 presidential election, only Wang is capable of integrating the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT, PFP and the New Party, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Yeh Yao-peng, former Control Yuan ombudsman, said that the
"pan-blue alliance" is more popular in northern Taiwan, while the
"pan-green camp" of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and its
ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, has wider support in southern
Taiwan. If Wang could serve as KMT head, this would help the
"pan-blue alliance" to make gains in the "pan-green" stronghold, he
added.
</P>
<P>
It is generally believed that Wang is supported mainly by party
members in the south while Ma is popular among urban citizens,
especially those in the north.

66% OF GRADUATING COLLEGE STUDENTS WORRIED ABOUT UNEMPLOYMENT: POLL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 12 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over 60 percent of Taiwan college students
graduating this summer are worried they might have difficulty finding
employment after graduation, according to the results of a survey
released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In the survey, conducted by the 1111 Job Bank on 1,104 students
between Feb. 26 and March 11, 66 percent of the respondents said they
are worried about not being able to find a job after graduation. The
survey is said to have a margin of error of plus or minus 2.9
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
Of those surveyed, 62.86 percent said they plan to enter the
workforce immediately after graduation, 14.49 percent said they plan
to continue their studies, 9.6 percent plan to perform their military
service, and 8.33 percent plan to prepare for employment-related
examinations.
</P>
<P>
The average "workplace competitiveness" score of those
respondents planning to seek employment immediately upon graduation
was only 64.2 points on a 100-point scale.
</P>
<P>
The top five favored occupations among the respondents were
administration and general affairs (27.72 percent) , accounting and
finance (22.64 percent), computer hardware and communications (17.93
percent), restaurant, tourism and transportation (14.86 percent), and
sales and trade (14.67 percent).
</P>
<P>
On average, the respondents expect to receive NT$26,804.43
(US$869.7) per month for their first job, or NT$1,600 higher than the
figure in a similar survey conducted last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in another survey conducted by the job search Web site
between Feb. 23 and March 11 on 725 employers, 74 percent of the
respondents said they are willing to hire fresh graduates.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 26 percent said they are not willing to hire fresh
graduates because of the graduates' poor ability to deal with stress,
their lack of work experience and professional skills, and their poor
work attitude, as well as the high costs involved in training new
workers.
</P>
<P>
Among the respondents who said they are willing to hire fresh
graduates, the considerations cited in determining whether to hire
one included the graduates' field of specialization, part-time work
experience, involvement in extra-curricular activities, reputation of
the schools they graduated from, and achievements in competitions as
well as whether they served as class leaders.
</P>
<P>
The qualities that employers are looking for in fresh graduates
include a good work attitude, a strong ability to deal with stress,
good communication skills, and an enthusiasm for work.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, NT$25,146.82 is the average starting salary that the
respondents believe is reasonable for fresh graduates. The figure is
NT$2,384 higher than that found in a similar survey conducted last
year.

Taipei City Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said
Saturday that he will formally kick off his campaign for the

</P>
<P>
After learning that Wang was on a trip Saturday to his hometown
of Kaohsiung to consult with his supporters about the possibility of
his entering the race, Ma said he has never expected to run
unopposed, adding that having more candidates enter the race is
better for the KMT because it means more people are interested in
serving the party.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the KMT would begin candidate registration after
March 21, Ma said he would announce his candidacy probably in April
at which time he would begin seeking the sponsorship of party members
to enter the race.

PRESIDENT ON CROSS-STRAIT POLICY: 'RECONCILIATION, BUT NO CONCESSION'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  12  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian reaffirmed
Saturday the government's pragmatic attitude in the face of Beijing's
proposed "anti-secession" legislation, saying that Taiwan will uphold
its policy of "reconciliation, but no concession; steadfastness, but
no confrontation."
</P>
<P>
Chen made the reaffirmation during an inspection tour of an Air
Force base in suburban Tainan in southern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China's proposed "anti-secession" law reveals its
attempt to use "undemocratic, non-peaceful" means to alter the status
quo across the Taiwan Strait, Chen said the government will deal with
any evident and urgent threat from the mainland with a pragmatic
attitude.
</P>
<P>
"We'll continue our reconciliatory attitude, but we'll never
compromise on our core values and basic stances. While we'll remain
steadfast, we'll not be provocative or confrontational," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that peace and democracy are Taiwan's core values, Chen
said protecting Taiwan's hard-won freedom and democracy will be the
most constructive contribution Taiwan can make to the international
community.
</P>
<P>
Chen further said mainland China's continued military buildup has
threatened regional stability and caused serious concern in the
international community.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Japan have for the first time announced in
their recent joint security communique that peace in the Taiwan
Strait is a common strategic objective, Chen said, adding that the
United States has also voiced opposition on many occasions to the
European Union's plan to lift its 16-year ban on arms sales to China.
</P>
<P>
"All these developments spotlight that China's military expansion
is no longer just a potential threat and has instead become an
evident and even imminent crisis," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that Taiwan's conviction for peace and democracy has
set it far apart from mainland China, Chen said Taiwan is determined
to defend its pluralistic, democratic lifestyle as well as the
international order.
</P>
<P>
In the face of China's mounting threat, Chen said the nation's
armed forces should understand the necessity and urgency of upgrading
their defense capabilities.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the government's pending massive arms procurement
from the United States, Chen said the plan is by no means aimed at
engaging in an arms race with China.
</P>
<P>
"The package is part of our efforts to build up an elite
deterrent force to back up the government's goal of setting up a
cross-strait military buffer zone and a viable cross-strait military
trust and consultative mechanism," Chen explained.
</P>
<P>
The arms procurement package, which is pending legislative
approval, includes eight diesel-electric submarines, six PACIII
Patriot anti-missile batteries, and a squadron of 12 P-3C Orion
anti-submarine aircraft.
</P>
<P>
This was President Chen's third visit to the Tainan air base. In
addition to joining military staff stationed at the base and their
dependents in making dough figurines, Chen also reviewed combat
facilities and military training exercises during his half-day
inspection tour.

CHEN URGES E.U. NOT TO LIFT ARMS EMBARGO AGAINST CHINA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian on Saturday urged
the European Union not to lift its arms embargo against mainland
China before Beijing improves its human rights record and implements
genuine democracy.
</P>
<P>
The president made the appeal while addressing a provisional
meeting of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party congress held at
the Taipei International Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
President Chen pointed out that Beijing has refused to address
the aspirations of the Taiwan people for democracy and peace, has
never renounced the use of force against Taiwan for the purpose of
unification, and has dismissed the efforts of the Taiwan people to
pursue democratization as unilateral provocation.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's verbal attacks and military intimidation has continued
unabated, Chen said, adding that it is now planning to use
"non-peaceful" and undemocratic means to sabotage the fruits of
Taiwan's democracy achieved over the past five decades.
</P>
<P>
With the situation in the Taiwan Strait stable and with the
success of the Chinese Lunar New Year cross-strait charter flights,
the two sides should move towards a further opening up to each other.
</P>
<P>
He lamented the fact that Beijing has instead pushed for the
enactment of an "anti-secession" law, which he said has raised
cross-strait tensions.
</P>
<P>
The president said that although China's national security has
been less threatened over the past decade than at any other period in
recent history, Beijing's defense budgets have increased by
double-digit figures during the last ten years.
</P>
<P>
China has deployed 706 missiles targeting Taiwan, and the number
is growing at 120 missiles every year, Chen said, adding that this
has tilted the military balance in the Taiwan Strait and led the
United States and Japan to say that "Taiwan is a mutual security
concern" in a joint statement following a Security Consultative
Committee meeting in Washington, D.C. late last month.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that China's military expansion as well as
its unfriendly attitude toward its neighbors have threatened the
democracy and security of Taiwan as well as regional peace and
stability.
</P>
<P>
"Before China improves its human rights record and implements
genuine democracy, there is no reason for the E.U. to lift its arms
embargo, " the president said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that many E.U. members are founders of the modern
democratic movement and that they have defended democracy with blood,
Chen said that if they were to allow an "undemocratic and
totalitarian" country to invade a free and democratic country, this
would be the biggest blemish in the history of democracy.
</P>
<P>
The president also said recently that if the E.U. were to lift
its arms embargo, imposed shortly after the 1989 Tiananmen Square
Massacre, it would be tantamount to "encouraging and supporting" an
"undemocratic and non-peaceful country" to use force against a
"democratic Taiwan."

LG TO PLACE US$1.4 BILLION WORTH OF ORDERS IN TAIWAN FOR 2005
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 12 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LG Electronics, the world's leading maker
of electronic products, plans to purchase US$1.4 billion worth of
electronic parts and components in Taiwan this year, the South Korean
company's CEO said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In 2004, LG Electronics bought US$500 million worth of Taiwanese
products.
</P>
<P>
Kim Ssang Su held a news conference in Taipei to announce LG's
2005 procurement plan in Taiwan. Asked whether the electronics giant
would continue to increase its orders on the island, Kim said that as
long as Taiwan maintains its competitiveness, LG will not only
continue buying more Taiwanese products, but will also seek
cooperation ties with Taiwanese companies.
</P>
<P>
The CEO told reporters that since the mainland Chinese market for
electronic products has been increasingly expanding, LG has forecast
that its operational revenue in the greater Chinese market, which
covers the mainland, Taiwan, Hong Kong and several Mandarin-speaking
areas, will account for 30 percent of the company's total operational
revenue in the near future.
</P>
<P>
In 2004, LG's operational revenue hit US$31 billion, and the
figure is expected to surge to US$41 billion this year, Kim said,
adding that his company has set the target of US$100 billion by 2010.
</P>
<P>
LG Electronics has declared its ambition to rank among the top
three electronics, information and telecommunication firms in the
world by 2010 in a statement posted on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
Of LG's US$1.4 billion worth of orders from Taiwan for this year,
semiconductor products, major electronic parts and LCD TV panels will
make up the bulk of the orders, according to Kim.

GOVERNMENT URGED TO TEMPORARILY SUSPEND CROSS-STRAIT EXCHANGES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 12 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government should temporarily suspend
cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges in the face of mainland China's
impending passage of an "anti-secession" law, scholars suggested
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar held by the Taiwan New Century Foundation,
Chen Ming-tung, a professor at National Taiwan University and a
former vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council, said that
Beijing's aim is to challenge the U.S. role in dictating the
cross-strait situation and to try to cross the red line of "no Taiwan
independence, no Beijing military action" set by Washington.
</P>
<P>
The enactment of the law could bring the entire Asia-Pacific
region to the dangerous verge of war, and both the United States and
Japan could also be drawn into a military conflict against mainland
China, he warned.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the passage of the law, expected to happen
Monday, will hinder cross-strait exchanges and upset the positive
atmosphere created by the success of the special lunar new year
cross-strait charter flights. In the current situation, it would be
very hard to continue two-way exchanges, including opening talks on
direct air links, he added.
</P>
<P>
Su Chin-chiang, chairman of the pro-independence Taiwan
Solidarity Union and a former national security advisor, urged the
government to cut cross-strait interaction for the time being.
</P>
<P>
Su stressed that Beijing has been trying to use every means,
including the "anti-secession" law, to bully Taiwan. The law is by no
means aimed at "a few separatists seeking Taiwan independence" as
Beijing has claimed, he argued.
</P>
<P>
Lin Cheng-yi, director of the Institute of International
Relations at National Chengchi University, proposed holding a
defensive referendum to counter the "anti-secession" law.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the "anti-secession" legislation reflects a
"pre-emptive" military strategy being mulled by Beijing against
Taiwan, Lin warned that it will eventually push Taiwan further away.
</P>
<P>
He contended that the "anti-secession" law is a war-mandating law
that will provide Beijing with a legal excuse to define the
cross-strait status quo and wage war against Taiwan under the
conditions that it sets.
</P>
<P>
To highlight Taiwan's right to say "no" to Beijing
internationally, the government should consider holding a referendum
to make the world aware of the Taiwan people's desire to safeguard
their democratic values and maintain their lifestyle, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also opined that the government should do its utmost to push
through a major military procurement budget as quickly as possible at
the Legislative Yuan and that it should step up its lobbying efforts
to persuade the European Union not to lift its ban on arms sales to
the mainland.
</P>
<P>
He added that at a time when Beijing is set to enact the
"anti-secession" law, the government in Taiwan should display its
courage and wisdom to the world.

PRESIDENT CALLS FOR ONE MILLION PEOPLE TO JOIN MARCH 26 RALLY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  12 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian on Saturday
called for "one million people" to participate in a rally set for
March 26 against the expected enactment of China's "anti-secession
law."
</P>
<P>
Chen urged the Beijing authorities to respect the free will of
the Taiwan people and not to miscalculate the situation, saying the
people on this island will not remain silent on China's stubborn move
to push through the legislation.
</P>
<P>
The "anti-secession law," which the National People's Congress of
China is expected to pass during its on-going session that ends
Monday, empowers Beijing authorities to use "non-peaceful means"
against Taiwan should the island moves toward independence.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the second provisional meeting of the 11th National
Congress of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , Chen
warned that China will further estrange people on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait by introducing a unilateral, unreasonable law to try to
legitimize the use of force against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"The 'anti-secession law' will allow China to determine the fate
of Taiwan unilaterally disregarding the right to free choice and will
of the Taiwan people," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
"The so-called 'non-peaceful means' is also in violation of the
international consensus that 'cross-strait differences should be
resolved through peaceful dialogue' and will lead to a unilateral
change in the cross-strait status quo and seriously hurt the feelings
of the Taiwan people," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the people of Taiwan expect continued peace in
the Taiwan Strait, and the leaders of China should try to resolve the
cross-strait deadlock with wisdom instead of damaging the atmosphere
of cross-strait reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Not to be outdone by Hong Kong, which saw 500,000 residents take
to the streets on July 1, 2003 to protest against a proposed
"anti-subversion law, " the DPP will try to draw at least one million
people to join the March 26 rally to protest the "anti-secession
law," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The president urged the people, regardless of their sex, age,
political affiliation and occupation, to participate in the rally to
demonstrate to the international community their resolve to defend
the democracy and peace of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Also during the meeting, DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang said Taiwan
is facing an unprecedented crisis with its freedom and democracy
being at stake.
</P>
<P>
As a party that has always stood by the people, the DPP is
obliged to exhibit its firm opposition to the enactment of the
"anti-secession law," Su said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou planted trees on
Mount Chinan in a northern suburb of the city Saturday to mark Arbor
Day.
</P>
<P>
The tree-planting activity was held to publicize the city
government's achievements in relocating villagers from dangerous
landslide prone areas on the mountain and to raise public awareness
of the importance of water and soil conservation, according to
officials from the Department of Economic Development under Taipei
City Government.
</P>
<P>
The tree-planting activity began with a ceremony during which
Mayor Ma bestowed awards on a water conservation association and Shih
Chien University for their assistance in making arrangements
regarding the tree-planting activity.
</P>
<P>
While addressing the ceremony, Ma said he hopes that Mount Chinan
could become a mountain filled with forests and that everybody could
remember the Republic of China founding father well on this day.
March 12 was designated as Arbor Day by the government in 1929 to
commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen who passed away on that date in 1925.

President Chen Shui-bian is expected to
take part in the large-scale rally being organized by the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) for March 26 against China's
"anti-secession law," a DPP lawmaker said Saturday.
</P>
<P>

According to Lai, the DPP had originally set the target of
500,000 participants in the rally, and the party now hopes at least
one million people will come out to "protect Taiwan."

SENIOR ROC OFFICIAL ARRIVES IN JAPAN FOR VISIT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Tokyo,  March 12 (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Republic of China Premier Frank Hsieh's
chief of staff arrived in Nagoya Saturday for a visit aimed at
learning from Japan's experience in organizing the upcoming Aichi
World Exposition, also known as Aichi Expo.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet Secretary-General Lee Ying-yuan was the first senior ROC
official to take advantage of Japan's new visa-free privilege for
Taiwan tourists to visit the country.
</P>
<P>
Lee said his visit is mainly aimed at touring Aichi Expo
facilities and studying the exposition's operational formula for
reference in organizing a world exposition in Taiwan in 2008.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials of the three counties selected to be sites of
the planned 2008 Taiwan world exposition -- Taoyuan, Chiayi and
Tainan -- are accompanying Lee on his current visit. The officials
include Chiayi County Magistrate Chen Ming-wen, Taoyuan County Deputy
Magistrate Huang Min-kung and Tainan County Deputy Yen Chun-tsou.
</P>
<P>
ROC Representative to Japan Koh Se-kai traveled from Tokyo to
Nagoya to greet Lee and other delegation members. The ROC officials
will visit Taiwan farm produce sales counters and restaurants selling
Taiwan-flavor foods and snacks at Aichi Expo theme park Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The eco-friendly Aichi Expo is scheduled to open March 25 and
last through Sept. 25.
</P>
<P>
With a view to attracting more foreign visitors to the Aichi
Expo, Japan passed regulations in February to waive the visa
requirement s for Taiwan tourists between March 11 and Sept. 25.
</P>
<P>
During the period, Taiwan passport holders can enter Japan
without visas for sightseeing purposes for a maximum 90-day stay.
</P>
<P>
Japanese government officials said they will also consider
whether to offer Taiwan citizens permanent visa-free privileges after
the Aichi Expo.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is Japan's second-largest source of foreign tourists after
South Korea. Japan began to offer similar visa waivers to South
Korean citizens early this month.
</P>
<P>
However, Taiwan's top five officials are still required to apply
for a visa if they decide to visit Japan during the world exposition
in the central Japanese prefecture of Aichi.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by ROC Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun
Chen last week, Japan's visa waiver is inapplicable to top five ROC
officials -- President Chen Shui-bian, Vice President Annette Lu,
Premier Frank Hsieh, Vice Premier Wu Rong-i and Tan Sun Chen himself.
</P>
<P>
For fear of offending China, Japan has traditionally been
reluctant to issue visas to senior ROC leaders.

PREMIER INVITES OPPOSITION TO PARTICIPATE IN MARCH 26 RALLY
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 12 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh on Saturday urged all
the Taiwan people, including backers of the opposition parties, to
take part in the March 26 rally in Taipei against Beijing's
"anti-secession" law.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh called for opposition supporters to join forces with the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in a gesture to show
Taiwan's solidarity to the world in the face of the impending
enactment of a law aimed at curbing Taiwan's independence.
</P>
<P>
Despite their different political stances, the people of Taiwan
should unite to protect Taiwan and loudly express their opposition to
the "anti-secession" law, the premier said, asserting that the
"Taiwan first concept" is shared by all the people in their pursuit
of making Taiwan into a sound and a great nation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) voiced its
opposition to the law for authorizing the use of "non-peaceful" means
in dealing with Taiwan and urged Beijing to rethink its planned
enactment of the law set for Monday.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan identity is not tantamount to Taiwan independence, and
Beijing should refrain from non-peaceful means to settle cross-Taiwan
Strait disputes, a KMT official said, adding that the KMT will do
everything it can to protect the dignity of the Republic of China and
maintain peace in the strait.
</P>
<P>
The DPP forecasts that at least half a million people will take
part in the March 26 demonstration.

VICE PRESIDENT LEAVES FOR VISIT TO TWO CENTRAL AMERICAN ALLIES

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice President Annette Lu left Taiwan
Saturday for an official visit to El Salvador and Guatemala -- two
diplomatic allies of the Republic of China in Central America.
</P>
<P>
The vice president will also make transit stops in Houston and
Miami during the 12-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Lu, at the head of the 152-member delegation, said prior to her
departure at CKS International Airport that the visit is aimed at
cementing diplomatic ties and introducing Taiwan's industries to its
allies.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, which in addition to government officials,
includes executives of state-owned and private enterprises, the vice
president said, hoping to introduce Taiwan's traditional and
high-tech industries to its allies and further increase trade
exchanges with them.
</P>
<P>
According to delegation's itinerary, Lu will inspect the
possibility of establishing a "Taiwan Park" for industries in El
Salvador, in the hopes that the park's construction can be completed
and its operations begin within the remaining three years of
President Chen Shui-bian's term.
</P>
<P>
If all goes well, the park project would be the first time that
Taiwan's public and private sectors join hands to make inroads into
the Central America, which would not only help Taiwan businesspeople
to reach out and flex Taiwan's economic and industrial muscle, but
would also help the island's bid to become an observer in the
Organization of American States.
</P>
<P>
Lu will also attend a regional meeting of Democratic Pacific
Union (DPU) in America in Guatemala. Not only six Central American
allies, but also five non-ally countries in North, Central and South
America will attend the meeting, Lu said, adding that this will be a
a warm-up to a DPU regional organization that will be established in
Taipei August 14.
</P>
<P>
During the 12-day visit, the vice president will call on
Salvadoran President Elias Antonio Saca and Vice President Ana Vilma
De Escobar and Guatemalan President Oscar Berger.
</P>
<P>
She will also be decorated by the two governments and will
deliver speeches to the parliaments of both countries.
</P>
<P>
On March 19, the vice president will have a tea party with the
media to give a major talk on the first anniversary of the
controversial election-eve assassination attempt against herself and
President Chen.
</P>
<P>
The opposition has accused the presidential election-eve shooting
as a set-up to win sympathy votes. President Chen won by less than
30,000 votes out of 13 million cast in the March 20, 2004 election.

DPP PASSES 'PROTECT TAIWAN' DECLARATION
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) passed a declaration at a provisional party congress Saturday,
reaffirming its commitment to promoting sweeping reform and
protecting Taiwan's sovereign status in the face of Beijing's
proposed "anti-secession" legislation.
</P>
<P>
The declaration, titled "Insist on Reform, Protect Taiwan, "
slammed Beijing's so-called "anti-secession" law as a piece of
legislation aimed at using force or non-peaceful means to alter the
present status quo across the Taiwan Strait and sabotage peace in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The proposed law is in violation of the international law and
detrimental to stability and security in the Asia-Pacific region, the
DPP declaration said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that Taiwan is an independent sovereign state, the
declaration said Taiwan's sovereignty belongs to its 23 million
residents and that only the people of Taiwan have a final say on any
change to its future.
</P>
<P>
With an aim to defend the 23 million Taiwan people's rights to
determine their own destiny, the declaration said, the DPP will join
hands with other domestic political parties and social groups to
organize a mass rally March 26 to make known to the world Taiwan
people's resolve to defend Taiwan with freedom, democracy and peace.
</P>
<P>
The declaration also urged the international community to adopt
effective common actions to prevent the Beijing government from
enacting the so-called "anti-secession" legislation which it said
would wreck cross-strait peace and Asia-Pacific stability.
</P>
<P>
As Taiwan's ruling party, the declaration added, the DPP will
staunch protect the 23 million Taiwan people's freedom and right to
determine their own destiny.
</P>
<P>
The declaration also reaffirmed the DPP's support for a
constitutional amendments package passed by the Legislative Yuan last
August, which will pave the way for Taiwan's constitutional
re-engineering project.
</P>
<P>
The declaration said the DPP will win as many National Assembly
seats as possible to facilitate the passage of the constitutional
amendments package by the mission-oriented National Assembly to be
elected May 14.
</P>
<P>
The DPP provisional party congress was aimed at discussing
nomination rules for selecting its candidates for the May 14 National
Assembly elections. A total of 300 seats will be up for grabs and the

STEPHEN M. YOUNG MAY BE NEW DE FACTO U.S. AMBASSADOR TO TAIPEI

<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 12 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stephen M. Young, incumbent U.S.
ambassador to the Kyrgyz Republic, is likely to succeed Douglas Paal
as the de facto U.S. ambassador to Taiwan, informed sources said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Paal, director of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) -- the
United States' unofficial office in Taipei -- is expected to leave
his current post in the middle of this year, the sources said, adding
that Young is Paal's most likely successor.
</P>
<P>
Young, a career diplomat, was appointed U.S. ambassador to the
Kyrgyz Republic, a former Soviet republic, in April 2003. During his
childhood he once lived in the southern Taiwan port city of Kaohsiung
along with his family for two years. He later twice worked at the
AIT, including serving as AIT deputy director from summer of 1998 to
summer of 2001.
</P>
<P>
Before Young's departure from the AIT deputy director post,
President Chen Shui-bian decorated him with the Order of Brilliant
Star with Grand Cordon, making him the first AIT official to receive
such an honor since the United States switched its diplomatic
recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Young has a Ph.D. in history from the University of Chicago. If
he truly becomes the new AIT chief, he will be the first U.S.
ambassador ever to transfer to the top AIT post in Taipei. In the
past, only AIT chiefs became U.S. ambassadors to other countries
after ending up their Taipei tenures.
</P>
<P>
Paal took over as the unofficial U.S. ambassador to Taiwan in
April 2002. U.S. officials said in private that Paal is epxtected to
end his Taipei tenure this summer. Paal's wife already returned to
the United States in February to take up a federal government post.
</P>
<P>
U.S. government authorities were not available at the moment to
comment or confirm the reports about the exact timing of Paal's
departure and his possible successor.

Yunlin County magistrate following the incumbent county chief's
conviction in an election bribery case, political sources said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Lee, a lawyer-turned-politician, once served as mayor of the
northern port city of Keelung. Lee was quoted as having said that he
has keen interest in serving as acting Yunlin county chief because he
is familiar with local government affairs.
</P>
<P>
Before assuming the PCC post in February, Lee had been vice
minister of the interior. He also once served as deputy
secretary-general of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).
</P>
<P>
A number of politicians have coveted the Yunlin magistrate post
since the Supreme Court handed down its ruling for former county
chief Chang Jung-wei Thursday, sentencing him to 12 months in jail
for his involvement in the 1994 Yunlin County Council speakership
election bribery case.
</P>
<P>
In addition three former DPP legislators from Yunlin county -- Su
Chih-fen, Kao Meng-ting and Lin Kuo-hua, opposition Taiwan Solidarity
Union Secretary-General Chen Chien-ming have also expressed keen
interest in the post.
</P>
<P>
According to current regulations, the Ministry of the Interior
must relieve a local government chief of his or her duties if he or
she is handed a prison sentence that cannot be suspended or commuted
into a fine.
</P>
<P>
As there are less than two years remaining in Chang's term, no
by-election has to be held to elect a successor. Instead, the Cabinet
is authorized by law to name a replacement to serve out the remainder
of the term.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Chang has already been suspended and detained since last
December for his alleged involvement in the corruption scandal. His
deputy is now acting as Yunlin county magistrate. However, the law
requires Chang's deputy, a political appointee, to be relieved of his
duties along with Chang.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet spokesman Cho Jung-tai said Saturday Premier Frank Hsieh
will decide on the replacement of Chang after a comprehensive study
of various possible candidates' qualifications. Whoever becomes the
acting county chief is believed to gain an edge in the year-end
magistrate election.

Confucius' lesson of the day: "A man who can resist the
long-continued attempts of others to insinuate prejudice into him, or
one who cannot be influenced by a sudden appeal to his own personal
safety -- such a man may be considered a man of perspicuity. Indeed,
a man who can resist such an influence, or such an appeal, must
really be a superior man."

<TEXT>
<P>
The military is closely monitoring China's
military movements after Chinese President Hu Jintao was elected
chairman of the CPC Central Military Commission Sunday, replacing
Jiang Zemin, a spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Liu Chih-Chian said that the Republic of China military has
heightened its alert in response to Hu's succession as China's top
military chief. It was reported that prior to Jiang's resignation, he
said to Hu that if the People's Liberation Army (PLA) plans to take
Taiwan by force, "It had better be sooner than later."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on news reports that the PLA has been ordered to "make
whatever preparations needed" against "possible countermeasures" that
Taiwan may adopt in protest against Beijing's enactment of an
"anti-secession" law, Liu reiterated that it is the defense
ministry's established policy and duty to prevent a war, safeguard
the national territory and fight terrorism regardless of the odds.
</P>
<P>
Liu stressed that the defense ministry has built up effective
deterrents and defensive capabilities to address any contingency and
the military will react swiftly if necessary.
</P>
<P>
The draft "anti-secession" law is expected to be ratified by a
vote in the Chinese National People's Congress Monday, the last day
of its annual session.
</P>
<P>
The law says China could use "non-peaceful means" to stop
Taiwan's secession from China should all efforts for peaceful
unification prove futile.

MTAC, RDEC HEADS TO BE NAMED AS DPP CANDIDATES FOR NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  13  (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cabinet-level Mongolian and Tibetan
Affairs Commission (MTAC) Chairman Hsu Chih-hsiung as well as
Research, Development and Evaluation Commission (RDEC) Chairman Yeh
Jiunn-rong will be nominated by the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) as candidates for the mission-oriented National Assembly
elections in May.
</P>
<P>
DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang said at a news conference Sunday that
both Yeh and Hsu are jurists who have devoted themselves to
constitutional research, so they will appear in the DPP's list of
candidates for the National Assembly elections slated for May 14.
</P>
<P>
During an extraordinary national congress held Saturday, the DPP
passed a special statute governing the nomination of candidates for
the upcoming elections, under which a total of 150 candidates will be
nominated by the party.
</P>
<P>
The top 60 candidates will be selected from among DPP chapter
chairmen, prominent experts and scholars as well as the elite of
society, while the rest will be recommended by DPP chapters'
executive committees, Su pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Su also announced that the DPP will select two prominent young
people from those who were born between Jan. 1, 1980 and May 13, 1982
and include them in the party's list of candidates for the
March 14 elections.
</P>
<P>
Noting that youth should not be absent from Taiwan's sweeping
constitutional reforms, Su encouraged young people to take part.
</P>
<P>
Su said that those wishing to participate in the selection
process must meet five requirements: have a strong passion for the
soil and people of Taiwan, persist in constitutional reforms, have
abundant experience in handling public affairs, share the DPP's
political concepts, and satisfy regulations governing National
Assembly elections.
</P>
<P>
Young people who satisfy the requirements are welcome to sign up
online at youngguns.iparty.org.tw or www.dpp.org.tw between March
13-17.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent announcement by the Central Election
Commission, 300 delegates will be elected exclusively for the task of
reviewing the constitutional amendment proposals passed by the
Legislative Yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
The legislature passed several constitutional amendment proposals
at an extraordinary session last August, including the halving of the
number of seats in the current 225-seat legislature, the adoption of
a "single seat, two votes" electoral system for the legislature, the
abrogation of the National Assembly, and the inclusion of the right
to hold referendums written into the Constitution.

WASHINGTON POST CRITICIZES CHINA FOR ITS BRAZEN TACTICS TOWARD TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  March  12  (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and P.C. Tan g)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Washington Post on Saturday
published an editorial criticizing China for using straddling
tactics to deal with its relations with Taiwan and panned the
European Union and for its "irresponsible" policy of lifting its arms
sales ban on China.
</P>
<P>
Saying that the Beijing leadership was worried that the world
would get the wrong idea from the recent flurry of conciliatory
gestures and concessions it has made with the Taiwan government that
suggested the possibility of a civilized and peaceful cross-Taiwan
Strait rapprochement, the editorial, entitled "Brazen China, " noted
that President Hu Jintao has now made it clear that Beijing's policy
of openly threatening Taiwan with a war of aggression remains intact.
</P>
<P>
The centerpiece of the Chinese National People's Congress meeting
this month is "anti-secession" legislation that "legally binds China
to attack the island if it fails to meet China's political demands,
" it said, adding: " Chief among these is that Taiwan's
democratically elected president, Chen Shui-bian, drop one of the
central planks of his platform, which is reform of Taiwan's
Constitution."
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that Chen has yet taken any steps toward
constitutional reforms since suffering a defeat in last December's
legislative elections, the editorial said that the president has been
reaching out to China and even struck a deal with a pro-Beijing
opposition leader in which he pledged to work to relax investment and
transportation restrictions and reiterated promises not to seek
independence for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
It also noted that China's military buildup in recent years has
been designed to prepare for an invasion of Taiwan and to repel U.S.
forces that might seek to intervene, saying that "hundreds of
missiles have been deployed within range of Taiwan, and new surface
ships and submarines have been purchased from Russia."
</P>
<P>
Criticizing the totalitarian Beijing government that has openly
renewed its determination to wage war and is working hard to acquire
the means to do so, the editorial also said that despite the Bush
Administration and Congress's appeals and warnings, the European
Union is preparing to lift its arms sales ban on China.
</P>
<P>
"France and Germany -- fierce opponents of military force when
used by the United states against a vicious dictator -- remain eager
to sell weapons systems to a regime that has formally committed
itself to aggression against a democracy, rather than joining with the
United States to help keep the peace in Asia, " it said.
</P>
<P>
"In effect, the Europeans place their own narrow commercial
interests above security cooperation with their NATO ally. It is a
grossly irresponsible policy," the editorial also said.

JAPAN URGED NOT TO SIT IDLY BY ON CHINA'S 'ANTI-SECESSION' LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Taipei, March 13 (CAN) Former President Lee Teng-hui called on
Japan Sunday to refrain from sitting idly by in the face of China's
proposed "anti-secession" law, saying that the Japanese government
should take action to block Beijing's legislation.
</P>
<P>
Lee, who is the so-called "spiritual leader" of the
pro-independence opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) , made the
remarks while addressing a seminar held in Taoyuan, northern Taiwan,
for 70 members of the Association of Lee Teng-hui's Friends in Japan.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Lee thanked all association members for their
participation in a rally held Feb. 28 in Tokyo to oppose Beijing's
plan to enact the "anti-secession" law, which provides the Chinese
military with a legal basis to use force against Taiwan in certain
situations.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Taiwanese expatriates, many of Taiwan's friends
from Japan and Tibet also took part in the demonstration to protest
China's desire for hegemony, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Beijing authorities are seeking to annex Taiwan by
enacting the "anti-secession" law, Lee said that Japan should not
adopt a wait-and-see attitude but should help the Taiwan government
block the possibility of China invading the island.
</P>
<P>
Should Taiwan and Japan fail to do anything, East Asian countries
can expect to face a serious disaster in the foreseeable future, Lee
claimed.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the outspoken former president urged all democracy-
and peace-loving countries to join hands to safeguard stability and
peace in the East Asian region.
</P>
<P>
China's rubber-stamp parliament -- the National People's Congress
-- is expected to pass an "anti-secession" bill next Monday morning
to provide the legal basis for China's use of non-peaceful means
against the island in certain situations.

BEIJING LAW COUNTER TO TERMS OF TAIWAN RELATIONS ACT: V.P. LU
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Houston,  Texas,  March 12 (CNA)
(By Yang Chia-hui and Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Visiting Republic of China Vice
President Annette Lu said Sunday that Beijing's draft
"anti-secession" law targeting Taiwan runs counter to U.S.-China
diplomatic ties mandating that China should resolve the Taiwan issue
in a peaceful manner.
</P>
<P>
Lu, who arrived in Houston Saturday night for a three-day transit
stay en route to El Salvador for a state visit, said during her
flight to Houston that if the "anti-secession" law were indeed passed
and allows the People's Liberation Army to use "non-peaceful means"
against Taiwan, the law would seriously contradict the principles of
the "Taiwan Relations Act" -- a U.S. law passed after Washington
established formal diplomatic relations with Beijing in 1979 with an
important condition that China will resolve the cross-strait issue
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Lu departed Taipei Saturday (Taipei time) for an
official visit to El Salvador and Guatemala -- two diplomatic allies
of the ROC in Central America. She is also scheduled to make transit
stops in Houston and Miami during her 12-day trip.
</P>
<P>
Lu said Beijing's "anti-secession" law is not just a problem for
Taiwan, it is a problematic concern for the whole world, particularly
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The vice president added that before departing Taipei, she has
exchanged views with President Chen Shui-bian several times over
Beijing's enactment of the law. She said she does not need to convey
the words of the president to the United States regarding the law
since the president maintains "very smooth" channels of communication
with America.
</P>
<P>
Lu was accorded a reception befitted a visitor of her status upon
her arrival in Houston, with William Brown, acting chairman of the
American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) , and David Lee, Taiwan's top
liaison officer in the United States, going aboard Lu's charter
flight to welcome her.
</P>
<P>
The vice president is scheduled to greet Arkansas Governor Mike
Huckabee and Congressman Solomon Ortiz from the state of Texas
Sunday morning via telephone.
</P>
<P>
Lu is scheduled to eat at a Houston steakhouse that President
Chen visited in June 2001 Sunday noon and meet with a group of
pro-Taiwan lawmakers in Texas.
</P>
<P>
In the evening, Lu is scheduled to deliver a speech on the
implications of Beijing's enactment of the "anti-secession" law at a
dinner with some 300 overseas Taiwanese who will come from around the
state of Texas.
</P>
<P>
Lu is scheduled to visit the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) headquarters Monday morning, making her the
first ROC vice president to tour an official U.S. organization such as
NASA during a transit stop.
</P>
<P>
Lu, at the head of a 152-member delegation, said prior to her
departure at CKS International Airport that the visit is aimed at
cementing diplomatic ties and introducing Taiwan's industries to its
allies.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, which in addition to government officials,
includes executives of state-owned and private enterprises, the vice
president said, hopes to introduce Taiwan's traditional and high-tech
industries to its allies and further increase trade exchanges.
</P>
<P>
According to the delegation's itinerary, Lu will inspect the
possibility of establishing a "Taiwan Park" for industries in El
Salvador, in the hopes that the park's construction can be completed
and its operations begun within the remaining three years of
President Chen's term.
</P>
<P>
Lu will also attend a regional meeting of the Democratic Pacific
Union (DPU) in America in Guatemala. Six Central American allies and
five non-allied countries in North, Central and South America will
attend the meeting, Lu said, adding that this will be a warm-up to a
DPU regional organization to be established in Taipei August 14.
</P>
<P>
During the 12-day visit, the vice president will call on
Salvadoran President Elias Antonio Saca and Vice President Ana Vilma
De Escobar and Guatemalan President Oscar Berger.
</P>
<P>
She will also be decorated by the two governments and will
deliver speeches to the parliaments of both countries.

TAIPEI, BEIJING SHOULD NOT PROVOKE EACH OTHER: U.S. SECRETARY OFSTATE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  March 12 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice said Friday that the United States hopes neither side of the
Taiwan Strait will provoke the other side and that as the U.S. is
continuing to modernize its military, China should realize it will be
unable to have a unilateral advantage in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The secretary made the remarks while responding to questions
raised regarding the rise of China as well as possible tensions and a
military imbalance in the Taiwan Strait in an exclusive interview
with the Washington Times. The full text of the interview was
released by the State Department Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Saying that China is a rising political and economic influence in
terms of its global interests and that China's peacekeeping forces in
Haiti is a positive contribution, Rice, who will soon visit several
Asian countries, including China, Japan and South Korea, said,
however, that such a rise has to be managed in a couple of ways.
</P>
<P>
"First of all, it's very important to be clear about American
policies and interests in the region and that means being very clear
about the policies. The second is to be active in making certain that
our alliances in the region are as strong as possible. Third is that
you have to recognize that China is going to be an influence and so
try to steer that influence into positive directions, not negative
ones," according to Rice.
</P>
<P>
Talking about U.S.-Taiwan relations, Rice said that the United
States has had and continues to have a "one China" policy and plays
the role as a kind of anchor, adding that Washington does not expect
"either side to try to exploit the situation or to provoke the other
side."
</P>
<P>
"We've been very clear to the Chinese that we have obligations
under the Taiwan Relations Act, " the secretary also said, noting
that she already said when she visited China before that arms sales
to Taiwan are a matter of record and the United States has already
agreed to do this.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the United States has a lot of leverage when it

KINMEN RESOLVED TO BUILD GIANT PEACE-INSPIRING MOTHER BUDDHA STATUE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Kinmen,  March 13 (CNA)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
People in Kinmen have resolved to build a
giant statue of Mother Buddha, or Avalokitesvara in Sanskrit, to
serve as an inspiration for peace across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
The Kinmen residents, including Buddhism followers and people's
representatives, as well as local government officials, elected
Kinmen Magistrate Lee Chu-feng Sunday to chair a committee
supervising the building and management of a 36-meter white stone
statue of the bodhisattva, better known to Chinese as Guanyin.
</P>
<P>
The Kinmen people enthusiastically envisage building the former
anti-communist bastion into a mecca for Buddhism followers, which
will also serve as a "torch of peace" for people across the Taiwan
Strait, Lee said after attending the first meeting of the committee.
</P>
<P>
It was decided by Kinmen-based Buddhism followers last June that
the outlying island should build the 36-meter Guanyin statue using
white stone from Quanzhou, Fujian province, to make the Mother Buddha
a landmark of Kinmen.
</P>
<P>
In a very short period of time, nearly NT$18 million (US$0.58
million) was raised for the initial spending of the building of the
statue.
</P>
<P>
Participants at Sunday's meeting failed to reach a consensus on
where the statue should be established. At least four rural township
chiefs lobbied for their places as the "most ideal" location for the
giant statue.
</P>
<P>
Lee decided that the location issue will be discussed again in
the committee's next meeting slated for mid-April.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Braving a chilly drizzle and wearing only
thin vests, a group of women, organized by the Non-war Action
Alliance of Taiwan, gathered in front of the Legislative Yuan Sunday
in protest against Beijing's soon-to-be-passed "anti-secession" law.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators put up posters and chanted "non-war" and
"peace" to express their opposition to the legislation that would
authorize the Beijing authorities to use "non-peaceful means" in
dealing with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chou Shen-hsin, convener of the alliance, said that almost all
wars were initiated by men, and women -- who account for half of the
global population -- were always the victims.
</P>
<P>
The activity was designed to demonstrate not only Taiwan people's
resolve in opposing the enactment of Beijing's "anti-secession" law,
but also her alliance's pursuit of peace, she claimed.

KAOHSIUNG HARBOR FREE TRADE ZONE TO SEEK GREATER INVESTMENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Kaohsiung,  March  13 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC) will re-double its efforts to help attract more
investment to the Kaohsiung Harbor Free Trade Zone to expand the
port's role, Vice Minister of Transportation and Communications Yu
Fang-lai said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Yu made the remarks while delivering a report on current
operations of the free trade zone at the southern port city during a
seminar jointly sponsored by the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) , the Kaohsiung City Government and
the Republic of China Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
According to Yu, the MOTC will target shipping companies that
have leased container wharfs at Kaohsiung Harbor, as well as
warehousing and logistics companies while seeking to lure more
investment to the free trade zone.
</P>
<P>
Yu said he hopes that economic benefits of the Kaohsiung Harbor
Free Trade Zone will be significantly expanded with investments by
domestic business sectors in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the seminar, CEPD Chairman Hu Sheng-cheng disclosed
that the government will revise various out-dated regulations in an
effort to boost development of the free trade zone, which became
operational Jan. 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
Hu said domestic entrepreneurs have opined that the ratio of
aboriginal people working in a free trade zone -- 5 percent of the
total workforce -- as stated in the Statute Governing the
Establishment of Free Trade Zones will scare away hopeful investors
because the ratio is too high in consideration of the fact that the
number of aboriginal people in the proportion of the total population
is low.
</P>
<P>
CEPD officials are actively communicating with the Legislative
Yuan to revise this regulation to facilitate attracting more
investors, Hu said, adding that his council will come up with a set
of new measures to help upgrade aboriginal people's employment rate.
</P>
<P>
Kaohsiung Harbor, along with Keelung Harbor in northern Taiwan,
are the country's first two ports authorized by the central
government to run free trade zones.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Executive Yuan has also given the green light to
a plan to set up a free trade zone at Taichung Harbor in central
Taiwan, which is expected to start operations at the end of this
year.

TAIWAN PEOPLE OPPOSE NON-PEACEFUL MEANS ON CROSS-STRAIT ISSUES: POLL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 13 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ninety-three percent of Taiwan people are
opposed to adopting "non-peaceful means" to resolve cross-Taiwan
Strait issues, particularly sovereignty issue, results of the latest
public opinion poll published Sunday showed.
</P>
<P>
The poll, authorized by the private think-tank the Institute for
National Policy Research, found that 93.4 percent of the respondents
disagree with Beijing's use of "non-peaceful means" against Taiwan
when it addresses the cross-strait sovereignty issue.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 84 percent of the respondents said it is absolutely
unacceptable that Beijing's draft "anti-secession" law, which follows
part of the PRC Constitution, says that Taiwan is a part of the PRC.
</P>
<P>
About 71 percent said it is absolutely unacceptable that the
"anti-secession" law stipulates that cross-strait disputes are
"internal affairs" of the PRC entitled to no "interference" by any
foreign country.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 85 percent said that the last thing they would believe is
that the "anti-secession" law would not infringe upon the rights and
interests of the Taiwan people.
</P>
<P>
The poll was conducted by Berkeley BIGC Co. March 9-12 soon after
the Chinese National People's Congress began to talk about the
enactment of the law targeting Taiwan. The law is expected to be
ratified by a vote by the NPC Monday.
</P>
<P>
The poll of adults selected randomly islandwide, obtained 1,067
valid responses, with a margin of error of 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the findings of the poll, Huang Wei-feng, vice
chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council, said that the
enactment of the "anti-secession" law revealed China's belligerent
and hegemonic nature. It attempts to deny the sovereignty of the
Republic of China and change the status quo across the Taiwan Strait,
tantamount to issuing a "blank check" for the People's Liberation
Army to attack Taiwan, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
He added that while Taiwan as well as the world are watching
closely China's enactment of the law, the Beijing leadership is
turning a deaf ear to Taiwan people's voices and the concerns from
the international community.
</P>
<P>
Huang stressed that it is imperative that the government review
its China policy in the wake of the enactment of the law. Beijing
authorities will take full responsibility should the passage of such
a law causes any repercussions leading to the retrogression of
cross-strait relations, he argued.

ANTI-SECESSION LAW CLEARLY RAISES CROSS-STRAIT TENSIONS: RICE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice said Sunday that China's anti-secession law clearly raises
tensions in the Taiwan Strait and that it is not necessary nor a good
thing to raise tensions.
</P>
<P>
The secretary, who is set to depart this week on a week-long trip
to Asia, which will include a stop in China, made the comments in an
interview on ABC's "This Week" program.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese National People's Congress is expected to pass the
anti-secession bill into law Monday -- the last day of its annual
session being held in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the United States has told both sides of the Taiwan
Strait that taking unilateral steps that raise tensions in the
cross-strait situation is not helpful, Rice said that the
anti-secession law clearly raises tensions.
</P>
<P>
"The United States has been an upright anchor in this dispute for
a long time. We have a 'one China' policy. Everybody understands
that. The key is that there should be no effort on either side to
unilaterally change the status quo, " she said.

DPP, TSU CONDEMN BEIJING FOR PASSING ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March  14 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) condemned Beijing Monday for
passing the Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan, saying the law is
causing irreparable damage to the development of cross-strait
relations.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, the DPP caucus condemned the move as
severely infringing upon the freedom, dignity and security of the
Taiwan people, and urged the Taiwan people to spare no efforts in
denouncing it.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the Republic of China is an independent
sovereign state belonging to the 23 million people of Taiwan. Any
move to change Taiwan's status quo, if not agreed upon by the Taiwan
people through a democratic referendum, is unacceptable, it added.
</P>
<P>
The Republic of China and the People's Republic of China are two
separate political entities, it said, adding that the fact that the
ROC government exercises exclusive sovereignty in the Taiwan area
should be respected by the PRC and the international community as
well.
</P>
<P>
The DPP caucus called for the international community to denounce
Beijing's Anti-Secession Law, saying that the law authorizes
"non-peaceful means" against Taiwan and is poised to escalate
cross-strait tension and undermine stability in the Asia-Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
The law also goes against the U.N. Charter's aim of safeguarding
world peace and runs counter to the universal values of freedom,
democracy and human rights, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, members of the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), an ally
party of the ruling DPP, have decided to hold a 24-hour hunger strike
beginning 4 p.m. Monday to express their vehement opposition to
Beijing's passage of the Anti-Secession Law.
</P>
<P>
The sit-in -- to be staged by TSU Chairman Su Chin-chiang,
ranking TSU officials and major party members -- is also aimed at
urging President Chen Shui-bian to immediately initiate a nationwide
defensive referendum, TSU legislative party whip Lo Chih-ming said.
</P>
<P>
Lo said that the Executive Yuan should designate March 14 as
"Taiwan Anti-Aggression Day" to mark the day that China passed a law
to try to legitimatize its suppression of Taiwan's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
He added that the government should immediately close all
communication channels with China and freeze all exchanges across the
Taiwan Strait to prevent Taiwan from "falling into China's trap."

The Straits Times
: Only $8,000 claimed from $60m held by Govt.

The Government owes members of the public
a whopping $60 million, but only $8,000 has 
been claimed since details were put on the 
website www.unclaimedmonies.gov.sg in November 
last year, says a Finance Ministry spokesman.

No claims have been made with the Law
Ministry, which holds a $50 million chunk. And 
just 15 claims have been made to the Manpower 
Ministry, the Singapore Examinations and 
Assessment Board, and the Supreme Court.

Monies available range from deposit
refunds for inactive refuse disposal accounts 
with the National Environment Agency, to 
outstanding Supreme Court deposits - one of which
is for more than $525,000.

The $60 million is owed by ministries, the
Subordinate Courts and the Supreme Court, and
excludes unclaimed money held by statutory
boards, of which the National University of
Singapore (NUS) has the largest number of people
who are owed money at more than 500.

An NUS spokesman said the people owed money
were mostly students from the past seven years
who had about $20 each left in their accounts,
and had either closed their Giro accounts or had
not left their contact details.

TAIWAN MAYORS, MAGISTRATES ISSUE STATEMENT AGAINST ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Kaohsiung, March 14 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seventeen Taiwan mayors and magistrates
issued a joint statement Monday opposing China's newly enacted
so-called Anti-Secession Law, saying the "ill-intended" legislation
destroys peace in East Asia and stability in the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Led by acting Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai, the 17 Taiwan local
government chiefs said in their joint statement that the
Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan ignores the sovereignty of the
Republic of China, counters the collective will of the people of
Taiwan and infringes upon the Taiwan people's freedom of choice.
</P>
<P>
As the mayor of Taiwan's second largest city, Chen took the
initiative to draft the joint statement and asked other local
government chiefs to support his drive by signing their names on the
document. With a view to making known to the world their opposition
to the law, Chen published an English version of the joint statement
in the Taipei-based English daily Taipei Times.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the question of who splits from whom does not
exist across the Taiwan Strait, the joint statement said the ROC has
always been a sovereign and independent nation and that any actions
to unilaterally change the status quo or downgrade Taiwan's
sovereignty goes against the will of the Taiwan people.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement, titled "Safeguarding Democracy and Peace,
Opposing Military Annexation: An Objection to China's Anti-Secession
Law, " said the crux of the problem in cross-strait relations lies in
China's refusal to recognize the ROC's sovereignty, its use of its
military might and missiles to threaten the peace and stability in
the Taiwan Strait, and its use of aggressive means to sabotage
Taiwan's international standing.
</P>
<P>
As the Anti-Secession Law completely disregards the ROC's
sovereignty, the statement warns that the legislation will worsen
cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that developing cross-strait peace and stability is not
only the universal goal of the international community but also the
common hope of the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, the
joint statement urged Beijing to be prudent regarding enacting the
"ill-intended" legislation.
</P>
<P>
Besides Chen, other signatories included Taoyuan County
Magistrate Chu Li-luan; acting Taipei County Magistrate Lin Hsi-yao;
Ilan County Magistrate Liu Shou-cheng; Hsinchu County Magistrate
Cheng Yung-chin; Miaoli County Magistrate Fu Hsueh-peng; Nantou
County Magistrate Lin Tsung-nan; Changhua County Magistrate Weng
Chin-chu; acting Yunlin County Magistrate Chang Ching-liang, Chiayi
County Magistrate Chen Ming-wen; Chiayi City Mayor Chen Li-jen;
Tainan County Magistrate Su Huan-chih; Tainan City Mayor Hsu
Tian-tsair; Penghu County Magistrate Lai Fong-wei; Kaohsiung County
Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing; acting Pingtung County Magistrate Wu
Ying-wen; and Taitung County Magistrate Hsu Ching-yuan.

TAIWAN SHOULD BE CLEAR ON ITS STANCE REGARDING NEW LAW: SCHOLAR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 14 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan should make its position clearly
known in the wake of Beijing's passage of the Anti-Secession Law, but
Taiwan should also avoid crossing China's "line in the sand, "
Professor Byron Weng with National Chi Nan University in Puli,
central Taiwan, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Analyzing the Chinese National People's Congress' passage of the
Anti-Secession Law Monday, Weng, a Hong Kong scholar who has lectured
in Taiwan for several years, said it is justifiable and
understandable that Taiwan society is indignant and opposes Beijing's
Anti- Secession Law, given that the law reflects China's total
ignorance of the truth that Taiwan is an independent, sovereign
state.
</P>
<P>
Weng said that the March 26 street rally that the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party is planning with the hope of a turnout
in excess of one million people is one way for Taiwan to make clear
its stance on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Clause 8 of the new law states: "If Taiwan independence forces,
under any name or by any means, cause secession, a major incident
causing Taiwan to split from China occurs, or if possibilities for
peaceful unification are exhausted, the state can use non-peaceful
means and other necessary measures to safeguard national sovereignty
and territorial integrity."
</P>
<P>
Passage of the Anti-Secession Law was not a surprise, Weng said,
adding that Beijing has "internal conflicts" to settle, prompting it
to spell out a clear warning to Taiwan, and China also knew that the
law would be for foreign consumption, particularly the United States
and Japan, on cross-Taiwan Strait relations.
</P>
<P>
While Weng claimed that the world has denounced the
Anti-Secession Law as " irrational, " the authors of the law argue
that it is aimed at reflecting the "rational side" of China on the
development of cross- strait relations.
</P>
<P>
However, Weng said that the passage of the law is not the end of
the world, and there are always options and possibilities for a
change in the situation.
</P>
<P>
Weng suggested that Taiwan make further efforts to improve its
diplomatic and legal projection, and bolster its techniques in
psychological warfare to consolidate its position.
</P>
<P>
If cross-strait relations continue as they are or no solutions
suitable to both sides are forthcoming, the situation should remain
stable, Weng said, but cautioned that the situation could turn
dangerous should one or the other cross the imaginary line in the
sand that could trigger the use of the new law.

ROC ECONOMICS MINISTER CONFIRMS HUSBAND WORKING IN CHINA

<TEXT>
<P>
Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh
confirmed Monday that her husband is working in mainland China with a
Japanese company but that this in no way violates any Republic of
China regulations.
</P>
<P>
Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, Ho said that her
husband began to work with the Japanese company in China long before
she became a minister and she reported the matter to Yu Shyi-kun when
he was still premier.
</P>
<P>
Ho made the explanation in response to Legislator Tu Wen-ching
from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, who claimed that
personnel from the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) or their
relatives could be in cells of China's "fifth column" of intelligence
agents.
</P>
<P>
Tu asked Ho to check how many relatives of MOEA staff are working
in China and even working for the People's Republic of China
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ho said that in light of Beijing's passage of the
Anti-Secession Law, her ministry would welcome an Executive Yuan move
"the sooner the better" to push for an overall review of Taiwan's
business and trade policy with China.
</P>
<P>
Ho said that the move had better be taken within one or two
months to lessen the impact of uncertainties on the industrial and

SHANGHAI-BASED TAIWAN BUSINESSMEN SAY NEW LAW WILL NOT IMPACT THEM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Shanghai, March 14 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most of the Taiwan businessmen operating
in Shanghai declined to talk about the impact of the just-passed
Chinese Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan Monday, saying that they
only care about the prospects of direct air links across the Taiwan
Strait.
</P>
<P>
The general manager of a Taiwanese real estate company said that
he does not feel the heat of the Anti-Secession Law and he speculates
that the law will not have any major impact on Taiwanese businesses
in China in the long term.
</P>
<P>
The general manager, who preferred to speak on condition of
anonymity, said that both sides of the Taiwan Strait have been too
"political." Instead, he said, the governments of both sides should
pay more attention to efforts to stimulate the economy and strengthen
development in affairs concerning the people's livelihood and
wellbeing.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that authorities from both sides try to resolve the
cross-strait issue from a global perspective, saying that a
cross-strait rhetorical tug of war does no one any good.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chen Fu-chuan, a Taiwanese president of a Shanghai
suit and accessory company, said he does not see a major impact from
the Anti-Secession Law on the operations of Taiwan businesses in
China.
</P>
<P>
Noting that cross-strait political bickering is benefiting none
of the Taiwanese businesses in China, Chen said that only the opening
of direct cross-strait air links would be conducive to constructive
development of cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
He lamented, however, that the increasing cross-strait political
impasse seems to have curtailed the prospects for the opening of such
links.
</P>
<P>
The president of a Taiwan human resources company based in
Shanghai said that as a businessman, he prefers not to talk about
politics and he does not care about the Anti-Secession Law.

'PAN-BLUE ALLIANCE' REGRETS BEIJING'S PASSAGE OF ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 14 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) on Monday expressed
anger and regret over the passage of the Anti-Secession Law by
China's parliament.
</P>
<P>
The National People's Congress passed the law earlier in the
day.
</P>
<P>
Clause 8 of the new law states: "If Taiwan independence forces,
under any name or by any means, cause secession, a major incident
causing Taiwan to split from China occurs, or if possibilities for
peaceful unification are exhausted, the state can use non-peaceful
means and other necessary measures to safeguard national sovereignty
and territorial integrity."
</P>
<P>
Chen Chieh, KMT caucus whip in the Legislative Yuan, said that
China rashly approved the law despite the opposition of all Taiwan
and without prior discussion with Taiwan leaders.
</P>
<P>
"Beijing has not shown any goodwill toward us, and we're angry
and regretful," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Chen also said that the KMT will have to first see what the
nature of the planned March 26 ruling Democratic Progressive
Party-sponsored rally against the new law is before committing to
joining it.
</P>
<P>
If the rally turns out to be a forum for pro-independence groups
to promote a new constitution, then it only will create conflicts and
rivalries, he said.
</P>
<P>
A KMT spokesman also issued a four-point statement that said that
the party will follow the Constitution, oppose Taiwan independence,
oppose the use of force and promote cross-strait peace through
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Chang Jung-kung noted that the Republic of China has been a
sovereign and independent country since 1912 and that both sides of
the Taiwan Strait have been under separate rule since 1949 and are
not interdependent on each other.
</P>
<P>
There is no question of Taiwan independence, Chang said, adding
that Taiwan independence is not the mainstream view of Taiwan. A
majority of Taiwan people want to maintain the status quo and will
not allow Taiwan independent advocates to give Beijing an excuse to
use force against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The KMT will adamantly oppose the use of force to threaten
Taiwan, Chang said, adding that the innocent Taiwan people have no
reason to suffer from the consequence of problems created by Taiwan
independent advocates.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the PFP said that it regretted that the passage of the
bill into law has caused worries in the international community and
made the people of Taiwan nervous.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chih-ping, PFP caucus whip in the legislature, said that the
best policy of Taiwan is to stick to the 10-point agreement reached
between President Chen Shui-bian and PFP Chairman James Soong during
their recent meeting, including the reiteration of President Chen's
promise of no declaration of Taiwan independence and no change of the
official name of the nation,
</P>
<P>
Chen expressed the hope that both sides of the Taiwan Strait can
address cross-strait issues calmly and rationally without radicalism
which could heighten cross-strait tensions.
</P>
<P>
Addressing President Chen Shui-bian's call for one million people
to take to the streets to oppose the law on March 26, another PFP
legislator was reserved about the idea.
</P>
<P>
Lee Yung-ping noted that since Beijing has already passed the
law, a demonstration by the DPP two weeks after the fact loses the
benefit of proper timing if the exercise was to try to stop passage
of the bill.

ANTI-SECESSION LAW THREATENS TAIWAN: LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 14 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng
said Monday China's newly enacted Anti-Secession Law threatens
Taiwan's survival and has caused anxiety in local society.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the remarks after China's rubber-stamp parliament --
the National People's Congress (NPC) -- passed earlier in the day a
law giving its military a legal basis to attack Taiwan if the island
moves towards independence.
</P>
<P>
Clause 8 of the new law states: "If Taiwan independence forces,
under any name or by any means, cause secession, a major incident
causing Taiwan to split from China occurs, or if possibilities for
peaceful unification are exhausted, the state can use non-peaceful
means and other necessary measures to safeguard national sovereignty
and territorial integrity."
</P>
<P>
The Republic of China's Legislative Yuan passed a unanimous
resolution earlier this month attempting to dissuade China from
enacting the ill-intended legislation, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
"Much to our dismay, the NPC failed to give any goodwill response
to our appeal, " Wang said, adding that he feels deep regret over
Beijing's new legislation.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the legislature's cross-strait affairs task force has
yet to begin operations.
</P>
<P>
At this critical moment, Wang said, the ruling and opposition
parties must remain calm and conduct a rational and in-depth
evaluation of the possible impact of the Anti-Secession Law and then
map out responses based on the common interests of all local people.
</P>
<P>
In his view, Wang said, the government's policy toward relations
across the Taiwan Strait should not undergo drastic changes abruptly.
Both sides of the Strait should exercise self-restraint and avoid
escalating tension and confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Both Taiwan and China should avoid provoking each other and
instead pursue genuine reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he would take part in a large rally to be organized
by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party March 26 to protest the
law, Wang, also a vice chairman of the opposition Kuomintang, said he
has yet to make a final decision. "I need to look into the matter
more before making a decision," he added.

the Anti-Secession Law passed earlier by China's parliament will not
endear the people of Taiwan, but they hoped that leaders on both
sides of the Taiwan Strait can exercise wisdom and rationality in
handling the matter.
</P>
<P>
The business leaders made the remarks after the National People's
Congress, China's rubber-stamp parliament, passed the law at the end
of its meeting in Beijing earlier that day.
</P>
<P>
Wang Tiao-chun, secretary-general of the Council for Industrial
and Commercial Development, said that one can see from the law that
China has done its best to try not to offend the feelings of Taiwan
people, to the point that as long as Taiwan does not seek
independence, it will be a law without teeth.
</P>
<P>
Beijing also has proposed consultations in the law that both
sides can now engage in, and Taiwan should seize the opportunity to
have dialogues with the other side, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
He said that rationally speaking, there are also voices within
Taiwan that oppose the island's independence and he believes that
Beijing's enactment of the law has been a response from the pressure
within.
</P>
<P>
Chen Cheng-yi, spokesman of the General Chamber of Commerce of
the ROC, also said that Beijing did try to convey goodwill to Taiwan
in addition to stating its stance on the law.
</P>
<P>
However, as the law targets Taiwan, it will inevitably hurt an
already democratized island, Chen added.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the law is a unilateral discussion about the rights of
Taiwan people, which will be unacceptable to Taiwan people who have
enjoyed freedom and democracy, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is only natural that Taiwan is mulling countermeasures
regarding the law, he said, adding that Beijing should also
understand cross-strait differences.
</P>
<P>
The law has already hurt the feelings of Taiwan people, Chen
said, adding that business groups don't like to see this, and hope
that cross-strait relations can return to more positive
developments in the wake of cross-strait charter flights during the
Chinese New Year holiday.
</P>
<P>
Hsu Sheng-hsiung, president of the Taiwan Electrical and
Electronic Manufacturers' Association, said that the Anti-Secession
Law is related to the cross-strait political situation, and any
political questions should be dealt with by political means.

DAA TO STAGE RALLY FOR DEMOCRACY AND PEACE MARCH 19
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 14 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Democratic Action Alliance (DAA) is
scheduled to stage a demonstration aimed at pursuing peace and
democracy March 19 on the first anniversary of the shooting of
President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu.
</P>
<P>
Huang Kuang-kuo, one of the DAA initiators, told reporters that
persons from all walks of life will be welcomed to take part in the
planned rally to help re-build Taiwan's value systems of peace,
democracy, justice and veracity.
</P>
<P>
Pursuing the truth of the 319 shooting will be part of the DAA's
appeals during the demonstration, Huang said. Chen and Lu were
slightly wounded in the election-eve shooting when two bullets grazed
their bodies as they campaigned in an open-topped jeep in the
southern city of Tainan. They defeated the "pan-blue alliance" ticket
of KMT Chairman Lien Chan and PFP Chairman James Soong by a slim
margin of less than 30,000 ballots, or 0.228 percent of the 13
million votes cast.
</P>
<P>
According to Huang, DAA initiators will call on leaders of the
ruling and opposition parties and ask them to lead their supporters
to participate in the rally with the main theme -- "Light up Taiwan's
Democracy, Pray for the Island's Peace."
</P>
<P>
As for President Chen's plan to take part in a ruling Democratic
Progressive Party-initiated (DPP) rally slated for March 26 to
protest China's Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan, Huang said that
it is really inappropriate for the head of state to participate in
the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
Terming Beijing's Anti-Secession Law as a domestic one, Huang
explained that the law is by no means binding on the Republic of
China because the ROC is an independent country with sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
He called on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to use peaceful
means to resolve their disputes, stressing that the DAA will strongly
oppose Beijing's use of force to deal with cross-strait disputes.
</P>
<P>
China's rubber-stamp parliament -- the National People's Congress
-- passed the Anti-Secession Law Monday, which provides the Chinese
military with a legal base to use non-peaceful means against Taiwan
in certain situations. 
</P>
<P>
In response, the DPP is planning to stage a nationwide rally
against China's enactment of the law March 26. Chen called for one
million people Saturday to participate in the demonstration to show
their determination to defend the island.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council have
said that the law is tantamount to a "blank check" authorizing the
Chinese military to use force against Taiwan, and accused Beijing of
jeopardizing peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
China still considers the island part of its territory despite
their split in 1949 after a civil war. Beijing has repeatedly
threatened to use force against Taiwan if the island declare
independence.

TAIWAN SOLIDARITY UNION MEMBERS BURN CHINESE FLAG IN PROTEST
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 14 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
Chairman Su Chin-chiang led several TSU party officials in a burning
of the flag of People's Republic of China in front of the Legislative
Yuan Monday to protest Beijing's Anti-Secession Law, hours after it
was passed by Beijing's National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Wearing headbands bearing the words "China invades Taiwan", Su
and the other party officials shouted anti-PRC slogans while setting
fire to the flag.
</P>
<P>
Su said the protesters will also stage a 24-hour fast in front of
the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Su said his party, which controls 12 seats in the 225-member
legislature, will motion to ask the Legislative Yuan to designate
March 14 as "anti-invasion day."
</P>
<P>
Lawmaker Lo Chih-ming, who is the convener of the TSU caucus at
the Legislative Yuan, urged President Chen Shui-bian to hold a
referendum along with the May 14 elections of National Assembly
members on the question: "Do you agree that Taiwan is a part of the
People's Republic of China?"
</P>
<P>
In addition to calling for resolution from the
Legislative Yuan tp condemn Beijing's Anti-Secession Law, Lo also
called on his colleagues at the Legislative Yuan to approve a
NT$610.8 billion (US$18.23 billion) budget for arms procurements and
to support an anti-invasion, peace-promotion bill that will be put
forward by his party to the legislature soon.
</P>
<P>
Before the protest, Su released a statement endorsed by the TSU's
so-called "spiritual leader, " former President Lee Teng-hui,
condemning the Anti-Secession Law, which provides the legal basis for
China to use non-peaceful means to take over Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the TSU decries the Anti-Secession Law as a law
approving war against Taiwan and stresses that Taiwan is a state
separate from China and that no one will be allowed to damage its
democracy, freedom, peace and stability.

ROC VP URGES U.N. TO CONDEMN BEIJING OVER ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Houston,  Texas,  March 13 (CNA)
(By Yang Chia-hui and Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Visiting Republic of China Vice
President Annette Lu urged the United Nations Sunday to stridently
condemn China over its enactment of a law authorizing the use of
force against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lu, who arrived in Houston Saturday evening for a three-day
transit stay en route to a Central America diplomatic tour that will
take her to El Salvador and Guatemala, made the appeal in a speech
delivered at a dinner given in her honor by major Taiwanese
associations in Texas.
</P>
<P>
The dinner happened to coincide with the passage of the
Anti-Secession Law by China's rubber-stamp parliament -- the National
People's Congress -- in Beijing before the conclusion of its 10-day
annual plenary session.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Article 8 of the law states: "If Taiwan independence
forces, under any name or by any means, cause secession, a major
incident causing Taiwan to split from China occurs, or if
possibilities for peaceful unification are exhausted, the state can
use non-peaceful means and other necessary measures to safeguard
national sovereignty and territorial integrity, " Lu said the
legislation is actually a "war authorization law" in which China
gives itself the rights to legislation, interpretation and sanction.
</P>
<P>
In her view, Lu said, the law is "not a law, " but rather a
political statement aimed at forcing Taiwan to accept its "one China"
principle as an ultimate unification term.
</P>
<P>
By enacting the law, Lu said, Beijing has unequivocally revealed
a move to unilaterally alter the status quo across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Noting that such a move is clearly in violation of common global
interests, Lu said the international community should condemn
Beijing's new legislation. As China is a member of the U.N. Security
Council, Lu said, the United Nations should condemn China over its
stark violation of the U.N. charter, which bans the use of force in
resolving any international disputes.
</P>
<P>
The outspoken vice president also urged the United States to show
moral courage by denouncing the Anti-Secession Law, which Lu said
runs against the fundamental U.S. premise of peaceful solution to
cross-strait disputes under which it established diplomatic ties with
China in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Lu, a legal scholar-turned-politician, said Taiwan's future --
independence or unification -- is basically a political issue, not a
legal one.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan is not subject to China's law and the so-called
Anti-Secession Law is inapplicable to Taiwan. Even though the
cross-strait situation is grim, we need not be panicked by the new
Beijing legislation. We should remain calm and redouble our efforts
to accelerate our national development and beef up our defense
capacity to counter Beijing's ever-mounting military threat," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Lu had lunch with a group of pro-Taiwan Texan
lawmakers at a Texas-style steakhouse in downtown Houston visited by
President Chen in June 2001. She received special gifts of a cowboy
hat and a waistcoat. Later in the day, she attended a cowboy festival
show at Reliant Park -- the world's largest cowboy showground and
American football stadium. Lu was accorded high-level courtesies,
circling around the 1.9 million-square- foot stadium aboard an open-topped
limousine and being introduced to a full house as "Taiwan's vice
president."
</P>
<P>
Wearing a cowboy hat, Lu waved to the crowd and received a
resounding two-minute welcome. Many Taiwan expatriates were surprised
and excited by Lu's unexpected appearance. The show was also
broadcast live to 52 countries around the world, helping to enhance
Taiwan's international visibility.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China's consulate in Houston mobilized a group of
Chinese expatriates and students in Texas to demonstrate outside the
restaurant where Lu dined with representatives of the Taiwanese
community in the southern U.S. state.
</P>
<P>
Lu is scheduled to visit the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) headquarters Monday morning, making her the
first ROC vice president to tour an official U.S. organization such
as NASA during a transit stop. Lu was greeted by William Brown,
acting chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), and David
Ta-wei Lee, Taiwan's de facto ambassador to the United States, upon
her arrival in Houston aboard a charter flight Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
Lu and her 152-member entourage will leave for El Salvador Monday
to start her two-leg Central America diplomatic tour aimed at
cementing ties with the ROC's diplomatic allies and exploring
investment opportunities for Taiwan businesses.
</P>
<P>
According to her itinerary, Lu will look into the possibility of
establishing a special industrial park to accommodate Taiwan-invested
firms in El Salvador.
</P>
<P>
She will also attend a regional meeting of the Democratic Pacific
Union (DPU) in America in Guatemala. Representatives from six Central
American allies and five non-allied countries in North, Central and
South America will attend the meeting, which will be a warm-up to a
DPU regional organization to be established in Taipei Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
During her diplomatic tour, Lu will meet with Salvadoran
President Elias Antonio Saca and Vice President Ana Vilma De Escobar,
as well as Guatemalan President Oscar Berger. She will also deliver
speeches at the two countries' parliaments.

BEIJING'S LAW VIOLATES INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS AGREEMENTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   March   14  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The enactment in China of its
Anti-Secession Law violates human rights agreements passed by the
United Nations and enshrined in the U.N. Charter, the Taiwan Bar
Association (TBA) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
TBA Secretary-General Su You-cheng said the association urged
Beijing to refrain from enacting the law but the latter turned a deaf
ear to the opposition of the Taiwan people to the law, which was
passed by the National People's Congress, China's rubber-stamp
parliament, earlier that day.
</P>
<P>
Faced with Beijing's high-handed action, the association will
take part in a March 26 demonstration initiated by the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party to express the exasperation and protest
of Taiwan lawyers, Su said.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the Taiwan public seek petitions to protest
against the law and send suitable representatives to the United
Nations to deliver the letter of protest and arouse international
attention.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, several civic groups said that the sovereignties on
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are independent of each other and
that there is therefore no question of secession.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei Secretariat of the Global Partnership for the
Prevention of Armed Conflict (GPPAC) , which is comprised of several
civic groups, made the remarks shortly after Beijing passed the law.
</P>
<P>
Chien Hsi-chieh, executive director of the Peacetime Foundation
of Taiwan, said that both sides of the Taiwan Strait are separate and
that only the question of whether to integrate with each other in the
future remains.
</P>
<P>
The enactment of law is even more threatening to Taiwan than
Beijing's earlier verbal warnings, Chien said, adding that the
approach will only make cross-strait relations regress and further
hamper cross-strait negotiations.

STATEMENT REACHED IN CHEN-SOONG MEETING HELPS COUNTER BEIJING'S LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 14 (CNA)
(By Nick Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If President Chen Shui-bian can act upon
the statement reached in his recent meeting with opposition People
First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong, Taiwan can counter the impact
of the passage of Beijing's Anti-Secession Law by China's
rubber-stamp parliament, the National People's Congress, Soong said
Monday at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
It is urgent for China and Taiwan to bury the hatchet and
emotional confrontation should come to an end right away, Soong said,
adding that the Taiwan people should voice their opposition to
annexation, independence and war with Beijing. They should also
appeal for peace, dignity and an equal basis for dialogue with
Beijing, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to a joint statement released Feb. 24 after the
Chen-Soong meeting, the two agreed that the national status of the
Republic of China as stated in the Constitution defines the de facto
and de jure status quo across the Taiwan Strait, and that this
sovereign status of the ROC deserves recognition and respect by both
sides of the Taiwan Strait and the international community.
</P>
<P>
Abiding by the Constitution, maintaining the status quo and
maintaining peace should be leading principles for cross-strait ties
and Chen pledged that during his term, he will not announce
independence for Taiwan, will not change the official designation of
the country, will not cover the "state-to-state" theory in the
Constitution, will not facilitate a referendum to change the
cross-strait status quo and will not wipe out the Guidelines for
National Unification and the National Unification Council, according
to the statement.
</P>
<P>
Chen and Soong agreed that the ruling and opposition parties have
to seek consensus on constitutional reforms to beef up the country's
competitiveness and the government's efficiency, but that the reforms
should not deal with changes to national sovereignty, territory and
cross-strait status quo.
</P>
<P>
To normalize cross-strait relations and establish a framework of
peace and stability, the two leaders decided that both sides will
work together to institutionalize a mechanism for cross-strait peace.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the government should negotiate with China on
cross-strait charter cargo flights and the opening of direct
cross-strait transportation links. The government should also review
and amend restrictions that hamper industrial development and
national competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Chen and Soong determined that any changes to the cross-strait
status quo must have the consent of the 23 million people of Taiwan
and that Taiwan will not rule out any possibilities in terms of the
future development of its relations with China.
</P>
<P>
On national security, they agreed that the government will
procure armaments necessary to step up the country's defense
capabilities under the strategic objectives of maintaining national
security, cross-strait stability and regional peace.
</P>
<P>
They affirmed that Taiwan will not engage in an arms race with
China and will seek to establish a cross-strait military buffer zone
and military confidence-building mechanism to temper cross-strait
tensions.
</P>
<P>
On the issues of ethic harmony, Chen and Soong agreed that anyone
using language or behavior that is abusive and discriminatory against
a particular ethnic group should be subject to punishment and that
both sides will promote the enactment of a basic law to protect the
rights of different ethnic groups and enhance ethnic harmony and
equality.
</P>
<P>
Lastly, they agreed that the government should ensure that
different ethnic groups enjoy equal rights and status regarding
economic, social, educational, cultural and examination issues.

Premier Frank Hsieh said Monday that
Taiwan's economic growth rate, or the gross domestic product (GDP)
growth rate, is estimated at 4.21 percent for 2005.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the remarks after presiding over a meeting of
officials in charge of economic and financial affairs.
</P>
<P>
The premier said the meeting focused on strategies to cope with
the general present economic and financial situations, as well as
relevant work agendas.
</P>
<P>
Given the current global market situation, Hsieh said, Taiwan
might be unable to achieve its previously projected economic growth
rate for 2005.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the government has decided to adopt a number of
stimulus projects, including an emerging market exploration program,
a broadband market expansion project, a TFT-LCD promotion project and
an NT$80 billion flood control project, to increase job opportunities
and stimulate economic growth," Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
If all those projects proceed smoothly, Hsieh added, Taiwan's GDP
growth could even reach 4.5 percent this year.

NO TALKS ON CROSS-STRAIT EXCHANGES BEFORE MARCH 26: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 14 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Monday that the
Cabinet will not discuss cross-strait industrial exchanges before
March 26, when a mass demonstration initiated by the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party will be held to protest against
Beijing's Anti-Secession Law.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh was responding to questions about the law targeting Taiwan,
which was passed by the National People's Congress, China's
rubber-stamp parliament, earlier that day.
</P>
<P>
The premier noted that the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
has conveyed the stance of the government in a statement that the
sovereignty of the Republic of China belongs to the 23 million people
of Taiwan and will not allow Beijing to infringe upon it by any
means.
</P>
<P>
"Cross-strait relations have been more tense than before and now
is the time when Taiwan people feel most revulsion toward China, " he
said, citing public polls showing that 93 percent of Taiwan's people
have responded negatively to the law.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the government's policy on facilitation of
cross-strait cargo transportation and industrial exchanges, the
premier said the Cabinet will not talk about the issues until the
Taiwan people have had a chance to express their views freely on
March 26.
</P>
<P>
Cho Jung-tai, spokesman of the Executive Yuan, also said that the
administration will not make any substantive responses to
cross-strait issues, saying that "with the current cross-strait
unfavorable atmosphere, it is obvious we cannot embark on any
dialogue on cross-strait exchanges."
</P>
<P>
Legislators across the party spectrum are expected to focus on
the response of the government to Beijing's Anti-Secession Law at 
Tuesday's general interpellation session in the Legislative Yuan, and
the Cabinet will work overnight to set the tone, Cho said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the premier said that the easing of the daily
fluctuation ceiling of stocks will be eased from the current 7
percent to 15 percent and will be put into practice "in due time."
</P>
<P>
The premier noted that the weighted price index of the Taiwan
Stock Exchange ended 48.72 points down, or 0.8 percent lower, at
6,155.51 Monday despite of the passage of Beijing's new law, which he
said shows that the stock market is mature.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh noted that the measure to ease the daily fluctuation
ceiling of stock prices was originally set to be implemented in
September, but he added that he has asked the Financial Supervisory
Commission to study related measures and then put them into effect,
based on considerations of both market development and stability.

MAC WELCOMES HONG KONG TO OPEN REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE IN TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 14 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)

<TEXT>
<P>
The Republic of China government would
welcome a decision by the Hong Kong authorities to set up a
representative office in Taiwan, a senior official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu was responding to
remarks made by Hong Kong acting Chief Executive Donald Tsang in an
interview with the Central News Agency earlier in the day that he is
willing to boost economic and cultural exchanges with Taiwan for
mutual benefit and that the Hong Kong government is considering
opening a trade office in Taipei to facilitate bilateral exchanges.
</P>
<P>
As the Hong Kong chief executive is not elected by Hong Kong
residents but appointed by Hong Kong's rulers in Beijing, Wu said, he
is not aware of whether Tsang's "opening representative office"
initiative has been approved by Beijing.
</P>
<P>
If the proposal is endorsed by Beijing and the Hong Kong
government really intends to open a representative office in Taipei,
Wu said, the MAC, which charts Taiwan's policy toward China and
handles exchanges with Hong Kong and Macau, will negotiate with the
Hong Kong authorities to realize this constructive proposal as early
as possible.

Premier Frank Hsieh said Monday that
Taiwan's economic growth this year is initially set at 4.21
percent and could possibly reach 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the remarks while presiding over the first financial
meeting of the Cabinet since he assumed the premiership Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
He said it is initially estimated that the economic growth this
year will be 4.21 percent, but could well be lower than that.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, the Cabinet will unveil new emerging market
project, a broadband market project and a TFT-LCD project, and will
approve an eight-year NT$80 billion (US$2.54 billion) flood
prevention project to help raise the economic growth rate to 4.5
percent through public investment and job creation projects.
</P>
<P>
The premier also said that the privatization of state-owned banks
should proceed as scheduled so as to build up momentum for the
government's plan to promote mergers among banks as a means of
strengthening the competitiveness of Taiwan's financial market.

ANTI-SECESSION LAW SAID 'STRATEGIC MISTAKE'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 14 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China's anti-secession legislation is a
strategic blunder, a defense strategist said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lin Chong-pin, a military strategy professor at Tamkang
University who also once served as vice defense minister, said the
anti-secession law came at a wrong time.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin, Beijing has long been planning to enact a law
to codify the use of force or non-peaceful means to stop Taiwan's
movement toward de jure independence.
</P>
<P>
However, Lin said, the situation across the Taiwan Strait had in
fact eased to some extend after Taiwan's pro-unification opposition
"pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First
Party (PFP) won more than half seats in last December's legislative
elections and President Chen Shui-bian and PFP Chairman James Soong
reached a 10-point agreement on cross-strait relations in February.
</P>
<P>
Lin said it is regrettable that Beijing's slow-pace political
operations failed to keep abreast of the swiftly changing Taiwan
political situation.
</P>
<P>
In his view, Lin added, the anti-secession law came at a wrong
time. "Now that pro-independence sentiment has been tempering, it's
unwise for Bejing to enact such a law to hurt Taiwan people's
feelings," he added.
</P>
<P>
The new Beijing legislation has not only drawn backlash from
Taiwan people but has also invited harsh criticism in the
international community, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
"In Taiwan, not only the pro-independence 'pan-green' camp has
voiced scathing opposition and even the pro-unification 'pan-blue'
alliance has slammed Beijing's move," Lin said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Taipei Society, a self-proclaimed legislature
watchdog, said the anti-secession law would only increase hostility
and distrust between the peoples on both sides of the Taiwan Strait
and force a retreat in cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
It further said in a press statement that by authorizing the
mainland administration and military to use "non-peaceful means" to
deal with Taiwan, the anti-secession law is actually a absurd
anti-human rights, anti-civilization and anti-democracy law.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Tsai Ing-wen of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party, who also once served as Mainland Affairs Council chairwoman,
said the anti-secession law will restrict mainland leaders'
flexibility in handling cross-strait affairs and thus makes it harder
in resolving cross-strait disputes.
</P>
<P>
"As the law allows for the use of 'non-peaceful means' against
Taiwan, cross-strait engagements will become riskier and Taiwan
people will face more risks while visiting the mainland," Tsai said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the anti-secession law will have a profound impact on
cross-strait ties, Tsai said, the government must make a
comprehensive evaluation and map out long-term strategies to cope
with the new challenges ahead.

TAIWAN  INVESTMENT IN CHINA MAY BE SLOWED:  MOEA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 14 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Economic Affairs Minister Ho Mei-yueh said
Monday that the ministry will slow down the pace at which certain
industries are allowed to invest in China and the pace at which bans
on certain imports from China are relaxed.
</P>
<P>
Ho made the remarks at an interpellation session at the
Legislative Yuan after the passage of the Anti-Secession Law by
China's National People's Congress, the rubber-stamp parliament.
</P>
<P>
Although the Cabinet has yet to decide on the direction of
cross-strait trade relations following Beijing's enactment of the
law, Ho said that cross-strait trade relations will not backpedal.
</P>
<P>
She said that Taiwan will not shy away from the items that are
already permitted in cross-strait trade, but the pace of opening to
items still under control will be slowed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a ranking official of the nation's top economic
planning agency, said Monday that the opening of high-level
technology to China will have to take national security into
consideration.
</P>
<P>
Yeh Ming-feng, vice chairman of the Council for Economic Planning
and Development, made the remarks when he attended a finance meeting
presided over by Premier Frank Hsieh.
</P>
<P>
Yeh said that the promotion of trade should be based on the
principle of mutual benefit. The unfriendly gesture of Beijing in the
enactment of the law has hurt the feelings of the Taiwan people, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the government has in recent years adopted
an "active opening, effective management" policy regarding
cross-strait trade exchanges, showing that apart from a few
industries, the government has not restricted manufacturers
going to China.
</P>
<P>
Although Taiwan has shown the maximum goodwill, China has not
shown appreciation and has not reciprocated in kind, which has had a
bad effect on cross-trait trade activities, he said.

GOVERNMENT URGED TO VOICE STRONG OPPOSITION TO ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 14 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several scholars and experts called on the
government Monday to drum up support from the international community
for Taiwan's opposition to China's newly enacted Anti-Secession Law
targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
They made the appeal after China's rubber-stamp parliament -- the
National People's Congress (NPC) -- passed the law earlier in the day
to provide the Chinese military with a legal basis for using
non-peaceful means against Taiwan if the island moves toward
independence.
</P>
<P>
Lai Yi-chung, director of the Department of International Affairs
of the Taiwan Thinktank, said that the NPC passed the law amid strong
opposition from major countries, such as the United States and Japan,
so Beijing is expected to show a goodwill gesture toward Taiwan in
bilateral economic and trade exchanges in an attempt to reduce
criticism from the international community.
</P>
<P>
However, Lai stressed that China's further boosting of economic
and trade exchanges with Taiwan cannot offset the serious impact of
the new law on political relations between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
The passage of the law means that Beijing will not accept any
options other than unification while dealing with cross-strait
political relations, Lai explained. But due to strong pressure from
the international community, he predicted, the Beijing leadership
will refrain from having a showdown with Taiwan in the short term.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the government should prepare for the worst and
integrate the efforts of the ruling and opposition parties and the
public in general to voice Taiwan's strong opposition to the law, Lai
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Huang Chieh-cheng, a former vice chairman of the
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council, said that the passage of the
law has not only undermined the previously created atmosphere of
cross-strait detente but has also raised the international
community's concern that China will probably resort to the use of
force to resolve the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
Originally, the Beijing authorities intended the law to deter
pro-Taiwan independence forces from causing the island to "split"
from China, but now the people of Taiwan strongly oppose the law
while several major countries have also voiced concern over the
issue, Huang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Huang further said that in the face of the law, the government
should take concrete action to safeguard Taiwan's sovereignty, adding
that taking to the streets is a feasible way to make China seriously
face the strong opposition of the people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the government to seize the opportunity to improve
relations with major countries and to send delegations to European
countries to lobby against any lifting of the EU arms embargo on
China.

NP LEADER TERMS ROC CONSTITUTION BEST RESPONSE TO ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 14 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition New Party (NP) Chairman Yok
Mu-ming called for the government Monday to use the connotation of
"one China" as shown in the Republic of China Constitution to respond
to Beijing's "one China" principle, saying that only in this way can
Clause VIII of China's newly enacted Anti-Secession Law be nullified.
</P>
<P>
Yok made the appeal at a news conference after China's
rubber-stamp parliament -- the National People's Congress -- passed
the law earlier in the day to provide the Chinese military with a
legal basis for using non-peaceful means against Taiwan if the island
moves toward independence.
</P>
<P>
Clause VIII of the new law states: "If Taiwan independence
forces, under any name or by any means, cause secession, a major
incident causing Taiwan to split from China occurs, or if
possibilities for peaceful unification are exhausted, the state can
use non-peaceful means and other necessary measures to safeguard
national sovereignty and territorial integrity."
</P>
<P>
Yok said that only by complying with the Constitution being
implemented in Taiwan can the government effectively cope with this
clause and allow the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to co-exist
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
He also asked the government to insist that cross-strait
unification should be approved by the 23 million people of Taiwan and
that Taiwan independence should also be approved by the Chinese
people.
</P>
<P>
In this way, Yok went on, the cross-strait status quo would not
be changed unilaterally and both sides could set aside the
unification versus independence debate to conduct constructive
competition.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Yok called on the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of
the Kuomintang and the People First Party not to take part in a
ruling Democratic Progressive Party-initiated rally slated for March
26 to protest the Anti-Secession Law.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that maintaining the status quo is the mainstream
opinion in Taiwan and said he is confident the people of Taiwan will
be able to deter pro-Taiwan independence forces from achieving their
goal.

CONDEMNATION BEST RESPONSE TO BEIJING'S LAW: MAINLAND AFFAIRS CHIEF
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 14 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The best way to counter China's enactment
of its Anti-Secession Law is to "unite the international society in
condemning it bitterly, " Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
In his first response to the Anti-Secession Law, which provides
legal basis for China to take over Taiwan by non-peaceful means, Wu
said that "China will bow to the ever-growing condemnation from
Taiwan and international society, and will show its remorse in action
toward Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
A referendum on the country's future is not an option being
considered by the government, he added.
</P>
<P>
The MAC, however, will review exchanges with China in light of
the newly enacted law but will not stop exchanges altogether,
according to Wu.
</P>
<P>
As to the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's plan to stage a
mass anti-Beijing protest March 26, he said "it is the people's
spontaneous expression of their opinion and the government won't
meddle."
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment the opposition Kuomintang's plan to send a
delegation on a tour of China later this month, Wu said it is the
party's prerogative to decide whether it is wise to visit China amid
the public indignation over Beijing's Anti-Secession Law and that the
party should be prepared for a public backlash if it goes ahead with
its plan.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed as "shameless propaganda" Chinese Premier Wen
Jiabao's offer earlier in that day for regular direct cross-strait
charter flights, saying that Taiwan is interested in direct charter
cargo flights but China has not responded to Taiwan's overtures.
</P>
<P>
He said Wen's proposal in the wake of the Anti-Secession Law is
like giving Taiwan a Band-Aid after flogging it. "We can't accept it
for the time being," he added.

PREMIER UNCOMMITTED ON WHETHER TO PARTICIPATE IN 326 RALLY

Taipei,  March 14 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh is happy to see any
civic activities which promote Taiwan's interests but has not yet
decided on whether he will participate in the March 26 protest
against Beijing's Anti-Secession Law, Executive Yuan spokesman Cho
Jung-tai said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Cho said the Executive Yuan is pleased to learn that more than 1
million people are expected to take part in the rally, which is sure
to draw international attention to the evil character of Beijing's
Anti-Secession Law, but the government plays a different role to that
of the private individual and the premier will decide upon his
response to it after taking into account reactions at home and
abroad.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officials from the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party, which is organizing the Taipei rally, said more than 150
private groups have signed up to take part.
</P>
<P>
Given that more than 1 million people could show up on the
streets of Taipei on that day, the party is planning to lead the
protesters through the streets along 10 different routes, all of
which will end at the square before the Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
DPP Secretary-General Lee Yi-yang called on the public to attend
the rally regardless of their party affiliation and ethnic groups, to
show the world their indignation toward China.

HONG KONG CIVIC GROUPS PROTEST BEIJING'S ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Hong Kong,  March 14 (CNA)
(By Jason Lu and Huang Kwang-chun)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Representatives of more than 10 civic
groups in Hong Kong staged a demonstration Monday in front of China's
liaison office in the special administrative region in protest
against Beijing's just-passed Anti-Secession Law.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators put up posters and chanted slogans against the
passage of the law earlier that day by China's rubber-stamp
parliament -- the National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
They left a letter of protest on the fence of the liaison office
before peacefully dispersing, as the office refused to send an
official out to receive the petition.
</P>
<P>
Lee Kwok-keung, chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Trade Union
Council, criticized Beijing after attending the protest for
hegemonically rushing through the bill regardless of strong
opposition from the people of Taiwan and concerns from the
international community.
</P>
<P>
He described the legislation as a dangerous move that he said
would not only cause regression in cross-Taiwan Strait ties but will
also heighten the Taiwan people's indignation toward China.
</P>
<P>
Lee suggested the two sides resume cross-strait talks immediately
and put an end to the hostility between them.
</P>
<P>
Leung Hon-wah, a spokesman for a youth service group in the
demonstration, also criticized Beijing for repeatedly ignoring
Taiwan's democratization and its pluralistic society.
</P>
<P>
Beijing did not consult the people of Taiwan prior to enacting
the law targeting the island, he pointed out, adding that his
organization supports increased exchanges and an accelerated pace of
negotiations on matters of mutual concern based on the principles of
equality and reciprocity.
</P>
<P>
Noting that neither side should unilaterally change the
cross-strait status quo, he called on the Beijing authorities to
respect the Taiwan people and recognize the reality of the Republic
of China's existence and its sovereignty.

Taipei,  March 14 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan called on both sides of the Taiwan Strait Monday to return to
the 1990's, when Taiwan forsook independence while China renounced
the use of force against Taiwan, and resume dialogue.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement issued after Beijing enacted an
Anti-Secession Law to justify the use of force against Taiwan under
certain circumstances, Lien said that "we insist that the Taiwan
issue should be solved peacefully, and we oppose firmly any recourse
to use of force."
</P>
<P>
Lien, whose party has always warned that the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's pro-independence policy will lead the country on
a collision course with China, said that the Anti-Secession Law
reflects the Beijing leadership's high degree of uncertainty about
Taiwan leaders' policy, and local pro-independence activists'
ever-increasing push for an independent country has only sharpened
their worries.
</P>
<P>
Noting that conflict is not yet unavoidable even with the passage
of the Anti-Secession Law and saying that the issue will remain
unresolved even all Taiwan people take to the streets in protest, the
statement said the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should heed what
the KMT has always preached -- stepping up economic cooperation and
resuming dialogue.

: Anti-secession law on Taiwan 'not a war Bill'.

Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao yesterday said
that the newly-passed anti-secession law on 
Taiwan was not a 'war Bill' but was meant to 
bring about peaceful reunification with the 
island.

Taiwan was quick to condemn the passage of
the law.

The island's top official on mainland policy
demanded that Beijing apologise to the Taiwanese
people.

'Not only is this kind of serious
provocation unhelpful' to relations, but it also
brought ' emotional pain to the Taiwanese
people', said Mainland Affairs Council chairman
Joseph Wu.

The Lianhe Zaobao: China pass the
anti-secession law on Taiwan.

The China National People's Congress (NPC)
voted 2896 to nil, with two abstentions,
yesterday morning to adopt the anti-secession
law on Taiwan.

U.S. VOICES OPPOSITION TO BEIJING'S ANTI-SECESSION LAW

Washington, March 14 (CNA) The U. S. State Department again
voiced its concern over Beijing's Anti-Secession Law Monday, calling
the law's passage earlier the same day "unfortunate" and reiterating
its opposition to the use of force to decide Taiwan's future.

E.P. COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN CRITICIZES ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Berlin,  March 14 (CNA)
(By Y.S. Lo and P.C.Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A leader of the European Parliament on
Monday criticized China's Anti-Secession Law passed earlier in the
day, saying that the law has provided Beijing with a legal basis to
use force against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Elmar Brok, chairman of the E.P.'s Committee on Foreign Affairs,
made the criticism in an interview with Berlin Public Broadcasting
News.
</P>
<P>
He also warned China that it should realize that the law "equals
opposition with Western countries."
</P>
<P>
Brok, a member of the E.P.'s largest political group -- the Group
of the European People's Party and European Democrats (EPP-ED) --
also said that establishing a legal basis for the use of force can
develop at anytime into the actual use of force which he said could
lead to a catastrophe for the whole region.
</P>
<P>
On the European Union's ban on arms sales to China, the chairman
said that although most E.U. members agree that the ban should
eventually be lifted, the E.P. still considers that it is not the
right time to do so as China has demonstrated a poor human rights
record. He added that with the passage of the Anti-Secession Law, the
E.U. has even more reason not to export weapons to China.
</P>
<P>
Brok had joined three other E.P. members from various German
political parties to send a letter to German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroder March 10 to voice their opposition to a lifting of the arms
embargo against China.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Buro Georg Javzembowski, a E.P. member and spokesman
of the EPP-ED for Chinese affairs, said in a statement issued
following passage of the Anti-Secession Law that the 23 million
people of Taiwan have the right to decide their own future, whether
it be reuniting with China or maintaining their sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the law has established a legal basis for China
to threaten Taiwan by force and possibly take military action against
the island, Javzembowski said that this fundamentally violates
international law.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is a democratic country, Javzembowski said, adding that
Western countries should make clear that they will protect democracy
and human rights. He also said that the E.P. will firmly oppose
interference in Taiwan's internal affairs with the Anti-Secession
Law.

2ND CHEN-SOONG MEETING CURRENTLY NOT IN THE WORKS: PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 15 (CNA)
(By Soifa Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Presidential Office doesn't rule out
the possibility of arranging a second meeting between President Chen
Shui-bian and opposition People First Party (PFP) Chairman James
Soong, an official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Office staff member was responding to media
reports that President Chen will meet with Soong again in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
The official said no plans for a second Chen-Soong meeting are in
the works at the moment. However, if it becomes necessary or if an
opportunity presents itself, the Presidential Office doesn't rule out
the possibility of holding such a meeting in the future, he added.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on media reports that Presidential Office
Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun telephoned PFP Secretary-General Chin
Chin-sheng Monday to discuss a possible Chen-Soong meeting, the
official said the Yu-Chin telephone conversation didn't touch on the
topic.
</P>
<P>
After China's rubber-stamp National People's Congress passed its
so-called "anti-secession law" Monday morning, Soong publicly urged
President Chen to faithfully implement the 10-point consensus reached
at their Feb. 24 meeting to avert the possibility of China using
"non-peaceful means" against Taiwan as mandated by the new Beijing
law.
</P>
<P>
"In response to Soong's public appeal, Yu phoned Chin to reaffirm
Chen's commitment to substantiating the 10 conclusions reached at the
first Chen-Soong meeting. Yu also exchanged views with Chin on the
'anti-secession' law's possible impact on Taiwan's domestic political
situation. But Yu and Chin didn't discuss any proposal regarding a
second Chen-Soong meeting," the official explained.
</P>
<P>
In the 10-point agreement, President Chen reaffirms that his
"five noes" pledge will remain good during his tenure as president,
that the country's name is the Republic of China as stated in the
Constitution, and that the rewriting of the Constitution will not
upset the status quo across the Taiwan Strait.

TSU EXTENDS SIT-IN PROTEST AGAINST ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 15 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU) on Tuesday extended its 24-hour hunger-strike protest
against passage of China's Anti-Secession Law.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chien-ming, TSU secretary-general, said that as supporters
in southern Taiwan want to join the sit-in protest in front of the
Legislative Yuan building, it has been extended to 30 hours and will
end at 10 p.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
TSU Chairman Su Chin-chiang, party officials and legislators
began the sit-in at 4 p.m. Monday after the National People's
Congress -- China's rubber-stamp parliament -- passed the
Anti-Secession Law which authorizes the use of force against Taiwan
should the island move toward independence.
</P>
<P>
Wearing a surgical mask and donning a headband which read "China
Invades Taiwan, " Su shouted the slogan "Oppose Aggression, Protect
Taiwan" while burning the national flag of the People's Republic of
China.
</P>
<P>
At 10 a.m. Tuesday, effigies of mainland Chinese President Hu
Jintao, Premier Wen Jiabao and former President Jiang Zemin were
decapitated by supporters of the sit-in to show their resentment
toward the three for advocating the Anti-Secession Law and to
demonstrate Taiwan's determination in fighting against the new law.
</P>
<P>
Two Cabinet officials -- Lee Ying-yuan, secretary-general of the
Executive Yuan, and Cho Jung-tai, spokesman of the Executive Yun --
also went to the site of the sit-in to lend support to the TSU
officials.
</P>
<P>
Fifty Japanese fans of former President Lee Teng-hui who are
visiting Taiwan also showed up to give support to the protestors. Lee
is TSU's spiritual leader.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the TSU is planning to initiate a defensive referendum
targeting Beijing's new law. The TSU said that Article 17 of the
Referendum Law empowers the president to initiate a "defensive
referendum" on national security issues should the nation come under
the threat of external force. The party also plans to present a
petition with signatures to President Chen Shui-bian to hold such a
referendum.
</P>
<P>
Yu Shyi-kun, secretary-general of the Presidential Office, said
that there has been no discussion within the Presidential Office on
whether the current situation meets the conditions stated in Article
17 for holding a defensive referendum.
</P>
<P>
Yu said that he is not clear about the contents of TSU's petition
to the president, adding that all related matters must await his
meeting with TSU Chairman Su later Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
President Chen initiated the island's first ever "defensive
referendum" on March 20, 2004, the same day as the last presidential
election.

MAC CHIEF SEEKS GLOBAL BACKING AGAINST ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Joseph Wu urged the international community to join forces with
Taiwan in its bid to counter Beijing's Anti-Secession Law, which he
said seriously threatens peace in the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Wu renewed the call Monday night in an interview with
Singapore-based CNBC and ASIA radio stations. The National People's
Congress, Beijing's figurehead parliament, approved the law earlier
the same day with the aim of warding off Taiwan independence at any
time.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that any use of non-peaceful means to settle
cross-strait disputes would be a violation of the United Nations
charter. Wu said that Beijing coming out with such measures in its
legislation has had a very negative impact in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's scheme to take Taiwan by force has not only aroused
conspicuous international concern but has also prompted different
political parties in Taiwan to protest against the law, he said.
</P>
<P>
He appealed the international community to express stronger
opposition to Beijing's serious provocation that is set to roil
cross-strait stability and claimed that fiercer international
criticisms may lead Beijing to rethink and employ peaceful and
democratic means in dealing with issues related to Taiwan.

</P>
<P>
The people of Taiwan strongly object to the law, as Beijing has
never ruled Taiwan for a single day over the past 56 years since the 
two sides of the Strait split in 1949, he argued.
</P>
<P>
According to the MAC chief, Beijing has got it wrong about
Taiwan's democratization and its constitutional re-engineering task,
which he reaffirmed has nothing to do with the sovereignty issue and
will not alter the cross-strait status quo.

PREMIER POSITIVE ABOUT MARKING MARCH 14 REMEMBRANCE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Tuesday that it
is a good idea to set March 14 as a special day to mark the passage
of the Anti-Secession Law in China.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the remarks when he was asked by Legislator Cho
Po-yuan of the opposition Kuomintang about the approval of the
Central Standing Committee of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) to set March 14 as "anti-annexation day."
</P>
<P>
The premier said that he was not aware of the event, but that it
sounded like a good idea, adding that what exactly to call the day
can be worked out later.
</P>
<P>
DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang said earlier that to galvanize the
will of the people of Taiwan, the party will suggest marking the day
that the National People's Congress, China's ceremonial parliament,
passed the law as "anti-invasion day" so that the people will
remember it.
</P>
<P>
Su made the remarks while attending a seminar on "Believe in
Taiwan and Say No to China" sponsored by the DPP, the Taiwan
Association of University Professors, the Taiwan Teachers' Alliance
and the Nuke-4 Referendum Initiative Association.
</P>
<P>
Su said that Taiwan has shown goodwill to the mainland for a long
time, hoping to maintain peace, but Beijing has stubbornly passed the
law, and the party, to galvanize the people's will, will suggest to
the government to mark the day as "anti-invasion day."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Anti-Secession Law sees Taiwan as a part of
China, and authorizes non-peaceful means -- military force -- against
a "free and democratic Taiwan, " in total disregard of the fact that
peace and human rights are mainstream values around the world.
</P>
<P>
Asked if President Chen will take part in a protest rally
launched by the DPP on the Anti-Secession Law, Su said: Wait and see
whether Chen will appear in front of the protest rally."
</P>
<P>
He urged all people in Taiwan not to condone the law tacitly, but
come forward to take part in the rally irrespective of their party
affiliation. They should show the true voice of Taiwan people whom
Beijing has said on whom it "pins its hopes."

TAIWANESE IN EAST CANADA ISSUE STATEMENT AGAINST ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Ottawa,  March  14 (CNA)
(By S. K. Wu and Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chapters of the Global Alliance for
Democracy and Peace in Ottawa, Montreal and Toronto issued a joint
statement Monday condemning Beijing's "anti-secession" legislation
targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has no right to meddle in Taiwan's internal affairs
because the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China have
been independent and sovereign states under separate rule since 1949,
the statement said, adding that the so-called Anti-Secession Law is
totally unacceptable to Taiwanese expatriates.
</P>
<P>
It called the law a plot by Beijing to unilaterally alter the
status quo across the Taiwan Strait and to legalize an invasion of
Taiwan under the conditions it sets, the statement said, claiming
that Beijing must be fully held accountable for the tension it fans
in the region.
</P>
<P>
The law has seriously hurt the sentiments of the people in Taiwan
and will extensively cast a shadow over cross-strait exchanges and
undermine detente in the wake of the special lunar new year charter
flights, it said, appealing to the Canadian government and the
international community to prevent Beijing from upsetting security in
the region.

DPP CAUCUS CALLS FOR OPPOSITION SUPPORT FOR ARMS PROCUREMENT PACKAGE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  15 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) urged opposition parties Tuesday
to support a long-stalled arms procurement bill in the wake of
China's enactment of what it called an "ill-intention" law targeting
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
DPP legislative whip Lai Ching-teh made the appeal a day after
China's rubber-stamp National People's Congress (NPC) passed almost
unanimously the so-called Anti-Secession Law that authorizes the use
of "non-peaceful means" to stop Taiwan from moving toward
independence.
</P>
<P>
In addition to passing the "bullying legislation," Lai said the
ceremonial NPC also passed China's 2005 military budget, which
amounts to US$29.5 billion (NT$1 trillion). If its hidden
defense budget is calculated, Lai said, China's total annual military
spending could reach NT$3 trillion.
</P>
<P>
"China has more than 700 ballistic missiles aimed at Taiwan and
its submarines have stalked Taiwan's eastern coast from time to time.
Now it has enacted the Anti-Secession Law. The passage of the war
bill-like law has changed the status quo across the Taiwan Strait, "
Lai lamented.
</P>
<P>
In the face of Beijing's ever-mounting saber-rattling, Lai said
Taiwan badly needs to beef up its defense capabilities. However, Lai
said, the government's plan to purchase a package of advanced weapons
from the United States, including eight diesel-electric submarines,
six PAC III Patriot anti-missile batteries and a squadron of 12 P-3C
Orion anti-submarine aircraft, has been pending legislative approval
for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
"The package requires an outlay of less than NT$600 billion over
a 15-year period, a negligent portion in comparison to China's
astronomical defense budget, " Lai said, adding that the
opposition-controlled legislature should stop boycotts of the package
and accelerate screening of the bill to facilitate upgrading of the
nation's defense capabilities.

KMT TO DISCUSS PUTTING OFF PARTY CHAIRMAN ELECTION UNTIL JULY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 15 (CNA)
(by LIlian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposal to postpone the election of the
chairman of the largest opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), for
two months until July will be discussed at the KMT Central Standing
Committee meeting Wednesday, a KMT official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lin Feng-cheng, KMT secretary-general, confirmed that the
proposal was made by a party think tank.
</P>
<P>
The think tank suggested that the party chairman election be put
off to avoid conflicting with the election of a mission-oriented
National Assembly, which has been set for May 14, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
The move is also related to the year-end city and county
elections, which will require time to coordinate with the party's
allies in the "pan-blue alliance, " which also includes the People
First Party and the New Party.
</P>
<P>
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Tuesday that he
supported the idea of putting off the party chairmanship election.
</P>
<P>
Wang, also a KMT vice chairman, said that by doing so the party
can focus on the election of representatives to the mission-oriented
National Assembly, which will be established for the purpose of
approving a series of constitutional amendments made last August.
</P>
<P>
The nomination of the party's candidates for the year-end city
and magistrate elections will also begin at that time, and the party
does not want the party chairmanship election to interfere.
</P>
<P>
But Wang said that he would announce his candidacy for chairman
Friday as scheduled, and that his campaign will continue despite the
postponement of the election.
</P>
<P>
With Wang soon to join the party chairmanship election, a KMT
official expressed concern that Wang and Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou --
who has also announced his intention to run -- might divide the party
since they both carry equal political weight.
</P>
<P>
Huang Chao-shun, vice executive director of the KMT's Policy
Committee, said that rank-and-file members are worried that the
competition between the two could further split and weaken the party.
</P>
<P>
She urged current KMT Chairman Lien Chan to mediate between the
two, saying that he has the duty and obligation to do this to ensure
a smooth transition.

MAC WILL PONDER LAW'S IMPACT WHILE EVALUATING CROSS-STRAIT EXCHANGES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 15 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san said Tuesday that the government
will take into account the impact of China's newly enacted
Anti-Secession Law on Taiwan and reaction of the public in general to
the law while evaluating new measures on boosting civilian, economic
and trade exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Chiu made the remarks at a Taipei symposium on Beijing's
Anti-Secession Law targeting the island jointly sponsored by the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and several local civil
groups, including the Taiwan Association of University Professors.
</P>
<P>
The MAC, the top government agency in charge of drafting Taiwan's
policies toward China, will conduct an overall evaluation on the new
cross-strait situation and future exchanges in various fields after
China's National People's Congress passed the Anti-Secession Law
Monday to provide the Chinese authorities with a legal basis for
using non-peaceful means against Taiwan if the island moves toward
independence, Chiu said.
</P>
<P>
Touching on cross-strait economic and trade exchanges, Chiu said
that in principle, those exchanges which are beneficial to Taiwan
will remain in place while those not being in favor of the island
will be suspended. For instance, Chiu added, no ban will be put on
exports of Taiwan farm products to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Chiu also said the Anti-Secession Law has demonstrated that China
is a dictatorial and bellicose regime, adding that many countries
have voiced their opposition to the law.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China's enactment of the law has triggered concern in
the international community that Beijing will probably resort to
the use of force to resolve cross-strait disputes, Chiu said that the
government will closely cooperate with the international community not
only in coping with the law but also regarding other issues.
</P>
<P>
The DPP has decided to stage a nationwide rally against the law
March 26. President Chen Shui-bian called for one million people
Saturday to participate in the demonstration to show their
determination to defend the island.
</P>
<P>
China still considers the island part of its territory despite
their split in 1949 after a civil war. Beijing has repeatedly
threatened to use force against Taiwan if the island declare
independence.

PRESIDENT CHEN VISITS TAIPEI MACHINE TOOL SHOW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  15 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian hailed the
machine tool industry Tuesday as the "mother of all other industries,
"saying that the government is planning to make central Taiwan a hub 
for the domestic industry, which is forecast to have an annual output
of NT$300 billion (US$9.68 billion).
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while giving a speech at the opening of the
2005 Taipei International Machine Tool Show, which opened March 15
and will run through March 20 at the Taipei World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
A record of more than 600 companies are exhibiting their advanced
items at a new high of 2,588 booths in the world's third-largest show
of its kind. More than 60,000 people are expected to visit the show,
including 3,000 foreign buyers.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government attaches a high degree of importance
to the industry and promised that it will do its utmost to help in
its upgrading.
</P>
<P>
He elaborated that the government's mid- and long-term project is
to turn the central part of Taiwan into a hub for the precision
machinery, nano-tech and bio-tech industries, taking advantage of the
Taichung area's air and sea traffic facilities to reach further
internationally.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, the domestic machine infrastructure
based in central Taiwan will be able to create a production value of
NT$300 billion by 2007, with an addition of nearly NT$20 million
coming from royalties.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's machine tool industry ranks as the world's
fourth-largest in terms of export amounts, lagging Germany, Japan and
Italy but ahead of Switzerland, Britain and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The country's outbound shipments totaled US$12.3 billion for
2004, up by 21 percent over the 2003 level -- the largest increase in
history.

LEGISLATURE ASKS PRESIDENT TO HOLD 'DEFENSIVE REFERENDUM'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 15 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Legislative Yuan adopted a non-binding
motion Tuesday urging President Chen Shui-bian to initiate a
"defensive referendum" in reaction to China's Anti-Secession Law that
authorizes Beijing to use force against Taiwan under certain
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
The "defensive referendum" refers to a right enshrined in the
Referendum Law in which the president can call a referendum, after
obtaining the Cabinet's approval, on issues of "national security
concern" in the event of a foreign threat that places national
sovereignty at stake.
</P>
<P>
The motion put forth by the pro-independence opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) also urged the Cabinet to revise related
regulations to make March 14 "Taiwan Anti-Invasion Day" and freeze
all dialogue and exchanges with China, which include cross-Taiwan
Strait charter flights.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the motion suggested that the legislature pass a
resolution to express its position towards the Anti-Secession Law and
pass an "anti-invasion and peace law" as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
According to a draft resolution entitled "uniting Taiwan,
resisting invasion and upholding freedom" put forth by the TSU,
legislators across party lines were unanimous in uniting the nation
and all freedom and peace-loving people around the world to halt the
vicious, aggressive conspiracy by a minority warlike syndicate within
China and safeguard peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and
in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The draft notes that freedom and democracy are universal values
pursued by all mankind, adding that the people of Taiwan have walked
out of the shadows of the Kuomintang-Communist civil war and Cold War
over the past decades and are committed to seeking freedom, peace,
democracy and economic development to become a prosperous, democratic
and free modern nation.
</P>
<P>
The minority warlike syndicate of China is attempting to change
the peaceful cross-strait status quo unilaterally by enacting the
Anti-Secession Law, which can include "non-peaceful means" of
unifying Taiwan and China that have been disdained by the
international community as an attempt to try to invade and annex a
democratic country, the draft says.
</P>
<P>
It states that the announcement of the termination of the "period
of national mobilization for suppression of the Communist Rebellion"
by Taiwan in 1991 marked the end of the civil war between the
Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party and the start of
cross-strait interaction on an equal footing.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decades, Taiwan has repeatedly shown its goodwill
to cooperate sincerely with China and has assisted with China's
economic development with capital and technology, but this goodwill
has not been reciprocated, it says.
</P>
<P>
It points out that the people of Taiwan and China have never used
force against each other and that Taiwan has become the greatest
moving force behind China's economic development and will be a major
catalyst allowing the Chinese people to enjoy freedom and democracy
in the future.
</P>
<P>
It urges the Chinese authorities to prioritize the well-being of
its people and not to become a" sinner" who damages cross-strait
peace and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
It says that Taiwan and China are independent of each other and
that the Anti-Secession Law is an invasion of Taiwan's freedom and
democracy.
</P>
<P>
The text of the resolution will be finalized through inter-party
consultations, according to Legislative Yuan Deputy Speaker David
J.C. Chung.

<P>
The International Organization of
Scenographers, Theatre Architects and Technicians (OISTAT) has
resolved to move its secretariat from the Netherlands to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was adopted Monday at an annual OISTAT world
congress, which is being held in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
During Monday's session, Taiwan's delegate to the world congress
-- Chang Wei-wen -- was elected one of the new members of the OISTAT
Executive Commission.
</P>
<P>
According to Chang, the OISTAT's decision to move its secretariat
to Taiwan shows its recognition of the contributions made by the
island's scenographers, theatre architects and technicians.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the non-governmental organization also hopes to use
Taiwan as a foothold to expand its development in Asia, Chang said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is a member state of the OISTAT, subsidized by the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). A
joint meeting of the OISTAT Management Commission and Theatre
Architects Evaluation Commission took place in Taiwan between Sept.
30 and Oct.
4 last year.
</P>
<P>
OISTAT is a cooperative, non-governmental organization and
operates under the auspices of UNESCO. OISTAT's main purpose is to
foster opportunities for cooperation between and among theatre
organizations. Since 2001, there are opportunities for individual
members in countries where no OISTAT center exists to take part in

TAIWAN RESPONDS WISELY TO BEIJING'S ANTI-SECESSION LAW: U.S. EXPERT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  March 14 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu, Oliver Lin and Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An American expert on cross-Taiwan
Strait issues said Monday that Taiwan's top China policy charter has
responded wisely to the Anti-Secession Law passed by the National
People's Congress, China's rubber-stamp parliament.
</P>
<P>
Alan D. Romberg, director of the East Asia Program of the Henry
L. Stimson Center, a think tank in Washington, D.C., made the remarks
in an interview with the Central News Agency in which he commented on
the new law.
</P>
<P>
Romberg said Taiwan's Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
expressed the opposition and indignation of the government and people
of Taiwan regarding the passage of the Anti-Secession Law,
underscoring Taipei's resolve to act responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, instead of reacting directly in response to the wording
of the law, the MAC wisely reserved any decisions on a concrete
response until after it sees what action Beijing might take to
implement the law, he said.

</P>
<P>
He also lauded Beijing for trying its best in the law's wording
to give some flexibility during the enactment of the law.
</P>
<P>
He cited Article 2 of the law that reads: "both the mainland and
Taiwan belong to one China, " instead of the original text of "Taiwan
is part of China."
</P>
<P>
In Article 8, Beijing says it will resort to non-peaceful means
and other necessary measures, in a situation in which the
"possibility, " instead of the original "conditions" for peaceful
unification have been exhausted, he continued.
</P>
<P>
Beijing also wants to make clear that the law is designed to
block steps that would formalize independence and totally close the
door to unification, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a senior associate of the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, another Washington-based think tank, said the
law can set in motion a series of steps by Taiwan that could lead to
a negative action-reaction cycle in cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
Bonnie Glaser termed this as "unfortunate, even if
understandable."
</P>
<P>
Noting that "the interests of the people on both sides of the
strait would be best served by the pursuit of positive initiatives by
both sides that promote cross-strait interaction and dialogue, " she
expressed the hope that Beijing will put forward goodwill gestures to
Taipei to limit the negative consequences of this law and help to
calm Taiwan's fears.

FM PITCHES FOR U.N. ACTION AGAINST CHINA'S NEW LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 15 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen
said Tuesday that the United Nations should take concrete action
against China's newly enacted Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while meeting with foreign mission chiefs
in Taipei to expound upon the government's stance on the
Anti-Secession Law.
</P>
<P>
The meeting came a day after China's rubber-stamp legislature
approved the law that authorizes the use of "non-peaceful means" to
stop Taiwan from moving toward formal independence.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Chen stridently condemned Beijing's new law,
saying it reveals China's "bullying and hegemonic" nature.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he hopes the international community can realize that
China has become ever-more menacing by enacting the law.
</P>
<P>
Since Beijing unveiled its legislative plan and key points of the
draft bill a few months ago, Chen said, the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs has instructed the ROC's overseas missions to explain to
their host countries the negative effects of the legislation.
</P>
<P>
Through their responses, Chen went on, he is fully aware that the
international community is unanimously opposed to China using
"non-peaceful means" to resolve disputes.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Chen said, China has accused Taiwan of being a
"troublemaker" in its international publicity campaigns and has
smeared Taiwan's referendum and constitutional re-engineering
projects as acts designed to change the status quo across the Taiwan
Strait.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the enactment of the Anti-Secession Law has exposed
Beijing's true nature, Chen said the United Nations should not sit
idly by and should instead take concrete action to invalidate the
law, which he said is in stark violation of the U.N. charter.
</P>
<P>
Chen stressed that the 23 million people of Taiwan love peace and
are "neither likely nor willing" to provoke China.
</P>
<P>
The minister further said the international community should not
hesitate to lend support to Taiwan or think that it is only Taiwan
that will fall victim to Beijing's new legislation.
</P>
<P>
"The world should never forget the historical lessons of World
War II, when international appeasement of Hitler eventually led to a
global war," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Beijing's citing of America's civil war lesson to
lobby the Bush administration not to oppose its anti-secession
legislation, Chen said Beijing misquoted former U.S. President
Abraham Lincoln's adage.
</P>
<P>
In his view, Chen said, Lincoln's famous maxim "United we stand,
Divided we fall" is more inspiring to Taiwan. In the face of China's
mounting missile threat, he said, the people of Taiwan should stand
united regardless of their party affiliation.

CHINA'S ANTI-SECESSION LAW MARKS TURNING POINT FOR TAIWAN: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 14 (CNA)

<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh claimed Tuesday that
China's enactment of the Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan is not
only a crisis but also a turning point for the nation.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the remarks in response to questions on the
Anti-Secession Law from ruling Democratic Progressive Party
Legislator Tang Bi-a during a general interpellation session of the
Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
No country in the world has enacted any law to legalize its
eventual use of force in the way China has done, Hsieh said, adding
that pursuing peace and co-existence is a current international
trend.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said the enactment of the Anti-Secession Law has not only
infringed upon international trends but has also let the
international community see that China is a bellicose regime while
Taiwan is a peace-loving country.
</P>
<P>
The premier called on the people of Taiwan to keep calm in the
face of Beijing's newly enacted law, saying that many friendly
countries have voiced their opposition to China's use of non-peaceful
means to resolve the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
During her interpellation, Tang invited Hsieh to sound a "peace
bell" to mark the common desire of the people of Taiwan for a
permanent peace.
</P>
<P>
China's rubber-stamp parliament -- the National People's Congress
-- passed the Anti-Secession Law Monday to provide the legal basis
for China's use of non-peaceful means against Taiwan if the island
moves toward independence.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council have
said that the law is tantamount to a "blank check" authorizing the
Chinese military to use force against Taiwan, and accused Beijing of
jeopardizing peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
China still considers the island part of its territory despite
their split in 1949 after a civil war. Beijing has repeatedly
threatened to use force against Taiwan if the island declare
independence.

SPECULATION RIFE ON WHETHER PRESIDENT WILL JOIN ANTI-BEIJING PROTEST
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 15 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian kept the public
guessing Tuesday about whether he will join the March 26 street march
initiated by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to protest
Beijing's Anti-Secession Law.
</P>
<P>
His chief of staff, Yu Shyi-kun, hedged when asked whether his
boss would be in attendance. Yu was leaving a meeting of the DPP's
Central Standing Committee Tuesday, and played down the significance
of Chen's participation.
</P>
<P>
He said the protest is aimed at airing the public's indignation
with the law which empowers Beijing authorities to use force against
Taiwan in certain situations.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the president's appearance at the protest isn't that
important, " Yu said, without confirming a report that Chen has
decided to lead the protest.
</P>
<P>
Noting that a consensus is beginning to coalesce among people at
home and abroad that the Anti-Secession Law is unwelcome and should
be condemned, Yu said the protest is sure to accomplish the goal of
bringing the situation to the attention of the international
community.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang hinted strongly that Chen
would indeed be at the protest.
</P>
<P>
Citing the fact that Chen has encouraged everyone to take to the
streets, Su said: "You can guess whether the president will attend
himself.
</P>
<P>
"Although former President Lee Teng-hui has kindly suggested that
Chen absent himself from the protest to give the public a free hand
to express their opinion, the president, who has always stood in
front of the people and given them leadership, is sure to stand at
the best position at the protest," Su said.
</P>
<P>
Chen is not the only government leader who is keeping his own
counsel. Premier Frank Hsieh told the Legislative Yuan the previous
day that he was still weighing the pros and cons of taking part in
the demonstration, noting that the role of government officials is
different from that of private individuals.

U.S. CONGRESS URGED TO CONDEMN CHINA OVER ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  March 14 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Formosan Association for Public
Affairs (FAPA), an overseas Taiwanese pro-independence group, urged
the U.S. Congress Monday to condemn China over the enactment of the
Anti-Secession Law that authorizes the use of force against Taiwan
under certain circumstances.
</P>
<P>
FAPA said in a statement that the law, which unilaterally defines
Taiwan as being subordinate to China, is absurd and inconsistent with
the status quo across the Taiwan Strait and is in violation of the
Taiwan policy of the United States.
</P>
<P>
FAPA pointed out that Washington "acknowledges" China's
sovereignty claim towards Taiwan but has never formally recognized
this claim.
</P>
<P>
The Anti-Secession Law provides China with the legal basis to
change the cross-strait status quo unilaterally and legitimizes
China's attempt to "compel Taiwan into accepting unification by the
use of force," according to the group.
</P>
<P>
Citing Carnegie Endowment for International Peace Senior
Associate Robert Kagan, FAPA said the three conditions set down in
the law under which "non-peaceful means" are applicable against
Taiwan mean that China can attack Taiwan merely because the island
"refuses to be absorbed by China by a timely manner," even if no move
toward independence is made.
</P>
<P>
This is against the long-standing policy of the United States and
has seriously jeopardized U.S. interests in the East Asia region, it
said.
</P>
<P>
According to FAPA President Wu Ming-chi, the group has started
lobbying U.S. Congress members to hold a press conference to openly
deplore China's move.
</P>
<P>
The group has also proposed that the U.S. Congress pass a
resolution to express its support for Taiwan's thriving democracy and
to reiterate the U.S. commitment towards Taiwan's security and its
policy that the future of Taiwan should be determined through
peaceful means and with the approval of the 23 million people of
Taiwan, Wu said.

ROC VP ARRIVES IN EL SALVADOR FOR OFFICIAL VISIT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
San Salvador,  March  14 (CNA)
(By Yang Chia-hui and Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Republic of China Vice President
Annette Lu arrived in San Salvador Monday after a three-day transit
stop in Houston, Texas.
</P>
<P>
Lu received a red-carpet welcome complete with full military
honors upon her arrival in the capital city of El Salvador for an
official visit aimed at cementing diplomatic relations with the
Central American ally and boosting bilateral trade and economic
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
ROC Ambassador Hou Ching-shan, Salvadoran Vice Foreign Affairs
Minister Eduardo Calix and many other officials greeted Lu and her
152-member entourage at the airport.
</P>
<P>
During a dinner with Taiwan expatriates in El Salvador, Lu said
she is hopeful that Taiwan businessmen at home and in El Salvador can
join forces to build an industrial park in El Salvador to accommodate
Taiwan-funded firms, facilitating bilateral trade and economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"The planned park should meet what she called the 'Three P'
goals, namely, the park should be productive, environmentally
protective and have perspective, " Lu said, adding that the park is
expected to begin operation before the end of President Chen
Shui-bian's presidential term in May 2008.
</P>
<P>
Lu will attend a meeting Tuesday to discuss details regarding the
planned park with Salvadoran officials and business representatives,
as well as inspect the planned site of the park.
</P>
<P>
On the last day of her transit stop in Houston, Lu paid a visit
to NASA headquarters, where she received courteous treatment
befitting a visitor of her status. She was granted the privilege of
entering the Mission Control Center -- NASA's nerve center.
</P>
<P>
NASA sent a Taiwanese-American astronaut, Edward Tsang Lu, to
guide Lu on a tour of Mission Control. Lu was also welcomed onto the
flight deck of a space shuttle to get a rare glimpse into the
interior of the spacecraft. The vice president also invited Edward
Tsang Lu to visit Taiwan to help inspire local youths' interest in
space technology.
</P>
<P>
Aboard the charter flight from Houston to San Salvador, Lu was
interviewed by the Central News Agency, in which she said she had yet
to decide on whether to take part in a large street parade to be
organized by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party March 26 to
protest China's newly enacted Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"It depends on the development of the situation across the Taiwan
Strait. At the moment, the most important thing is to calm down and
consolidate domestic unity. We should refrain from excessively
emotion-charged reaction and instead pool our wisdom to work out
appropriate response measures," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
China's rubber-stamp National People's Congress (NPC) on Monday
passed the Anti-Secession Law that authorizes the use of
"non-peaceful means" to stop Taiwan from seeking formal independence.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the law is in stark violation of the United Nations
charter, the United Nations declaration on world peace and human
rights and the United States' Taiwan Relations Act, Lu said the
international community should now come to understand that China is a
real troublemaker.
</P>
<P>
Major countries around the world, including the United States,
Japan and the European Union, have voiced opposition to China's new
law, Lu said, adding that she believes Beijing will have to pay a
heavy price for its "ill-intentioned" legislation.
</P>
<P>
El Salvador is the first leg of Lu's current Central America
diplomatic tour that will also take her to Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
According to Lu's itinerary, Lu will attend a regional meeting of
the Democratic Pacific Union (DPU) in America in Guatemala.
Representatives from six Central American allies and five non-allied
countries in North, Central and South America will attend the
meeting, which will be a warm-up to a DPU regional organization to be
established in Taipei Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
During her diplomatic tour, Lu will meet with Salvadoran
President Elias Antonio Saca and Vice President Ana Vilma De Escobar,
as well as Guatemalan President Oscar Berger. She will also deliver
speeches at the two countries' parliaments.

DPP ORDERS PARTY MEMBERS TO ATTEND ANTI-BEIJING PROTEST
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 15 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) ordered all of its party members Tuesday to attend a party-
initiated March 26 protest to show Taiwan's resentment of Beijing's
Anti-Secession Law.
</P>
<P>
As a part of its all-out efforts to ensure a good turnout at the
protest, the party's Central Standing Committee brought out a most
urgent party decree to make sure that all its members show up and
stand alongside the rest of the public in the protest.
</P>
<P>
In order to meet the party's goal of mobilizing at least 200,000
of its people March 26, the decree assigns party lawmakers a quota of
demonstrators they are supposed to bring to the protest.
</P>
<P>
The quota varies according to the distances of the lawmakers'
constituencies from Taipei where the protest will be held. For each
lawmaker elected from Taipei County and Taipei City, the quota is
2,025 people, for lawmakers from northern Taiwan, it is 1,350 people,
and for lawmakers from Hualien and Taitung in eastern Taiwan, it is
900 people.
</P>
<P>
Together with members of other private organizations that have
signed up to join the protest, the organizers predicted a record 1
million people will be brought together for the protest.
</P>
<P>
The DPP Central Standing Committee also unveiled TV and radio
commercials that will be played on local TV and radio stations in the
lead-up to March 26 to encourage people to join the protest.
</P>
<P>
The commercials are compilations of films of Chinese Foreign
Minister Li Zhaoxing's bitter criticism of Taiwan, Hong Kong's march
for democracy July 1, 2004, and a human chain formed in Taiwan as a
symbol of its defense Feb. 28, 2004.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the protest is defined as "peace and democracy, "
which are universal values. Other political calls, such as renaming
the country, are not included, according to DPP Secretary-General Lee
Yi-yang.
</P>
<P>
The protesters will be led through downtown Taipei along 10
different routes and will converge in the square in front of the
Presidential Office, according to the DPP.
</P>
<P>
A DPP official said his party will meet with other sponsors of
the protest, all private groups, on Wednesday to work out further
details.

KMT LAWMAKERS REGRET PASSAGE OF ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 15 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers
expressed Tuesday their regret and worry that China has "willfully"
enacted the Anti-Secession Law against Taiwan despite objections by
Taiwan politicians across party lines.
</P>
<P>
A statement released under the name of the KMT legislative caucus
said that cross-Taiwan Strait peace and prosperity is the expectation
of people in the Asia-Pacific region and on both sides of the strait
and that the caucus firmly opposes any military threat against
Taiwan, a cross-strait arms race and the use of force.
</P>
<P>
The caucus pointed out that cross-strait confrontation and
conflict could intensify tension between the two sides, which it said
is in violation of the interests of the people on both sides.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan and China should instead interact based on goodwill,
resume dialogue, promote economic, sports and agricultural exchanges
and work to open direct cross-strait transportation links, the caucus
proposed.
</P>
<P>
Saying that Taiwan people are not equal to pro-independence
activists and that the Taiwanese consciousness does not equal
independence consciousness, the caucus urged the Democratic
Progressive Party government to pay attention to what it claimed is a
mainstream "anti-independence" public opinion in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
It asked the government to stop any provocative move such as
promoting a referendum on a new constitution and a campaign to change
the official name of the country from Republic of China to "Republic
of Taiwan" so as not to create any excuse for China to invade.
</P>
<P>
It said the government should abide by the Constitution and
uphold the sovereignty of the ROC to safeguard the well-being of the
country and its people.

Education officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Vice Minister of Education Lu Mu-lin will head the delegation to
the fair, which will be held March 26-27 at the Seoul Convention and
Exhibition Center, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will introduce Taiwan's education policies and

The fair is the biggest study abroad exhibition in Korea and is
the focal point of attention of Korean students eager to obtain
first-hand information and professional, career-related advice from
experienced Korean and foreign educators, according to the
organizers.

<P>
A group of Taiwanese expatriates in western
Japan issued a joint declaration Tuesday to protest against China's
enactment of its Anti-Secession Law.
</P>
<P>
The declaration was released during a seminar attended by more
than 70 members of the Taiwanese community in the region.
</P>
<P>
The declaration states that the Republic of China is a sovereign
state that is committed to maintaining peace and security across the
Taiwan Strait and pursuing economic development.
</P>
<P>
The enactment of the Anti-Secession Law has trampled on the
rights and public opinion of the people of Taiwan and is a despotic
move that has jeopardized security and peace across the strait and in
the entire Asia-Pacific region, the declaration says.
</P>
<P>
It says the law has also placed the property and lives of more
than one million China-based Taiwanese businessmen at stake.
</P>
<P>
It points out that Taiwan has become a true democracy after the
transition of power in 2000 and that public opinion in Taiwan does
not want to merge with a totalitarian China.

KMT MIGHT PUT OFF PARTY CHAIRMAN ELECTION TO JULY 23

Taipei,  March  15 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
passed a draft program Tuesday on the election of the party's new
chairman, under which the election date might be postponed from the
originally set May 28 to July 23.
</P>
<P>
The draft program, adopted at an extraordinary KMT central
working-level meeting, is expected to be approved by the party's
Central Standing Committee at its weekly meeting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to KMT officials, the preliminary program on the
elections of the party's new chairman and delegates was drafted based
upon a proposal made by Tsai Hsun-hsiung, executive director of a
party think tank,
</P>
<P>
Tsai suggested that the election of KMT chairman be put off to
avoid conflicting with the election of a mission-oriented National
Assembly slated for May 14.
</P>
<P>
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who serves concurrently as a KMT vice
chairman, has announced his intention to run for the chairmanship,
while Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, also a KMT vice
chairman, is scheduled to announce his candidacy Friday.
</P>
<P>
Both Ma and Wang also supported the idea of putting off the party
chairmanship election so that the party can focus on the election of
delegates to the mission-oriented National Assembly, which will be
established exclusively for the task of approving a series of
constitutional amendments adopted by the legislature last August, the
official said.

FARMERS URGED TO DEFEND TAIWAN IN FACE OF CHINA'S ANTI-SECESSION LAW

<P>
An elderly farmer called on the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) Taitung County Chapter Tuesday
to summon local farmers to form a "salvation team" with the aim of
saving the country in the wake of China's enactment of its
Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-nine-year-old Liu Chin-yu said that he will invite his
counterparts from the eastern county to join the team and ask them to
refrain from investing in China, even though the Beijing authorities
are set to give Taiwan's agricultural sector greater access to the
China market.
</P>
<P>
Saying that there has been one country on each side of the Taiwan
Strait since the former Kuomintang government fled to Taiwan
following its civil war defeat in 1949, Liu said that the enactment
of the Anti-Secession Law by Beijing has fully exposed China's
hegemony.
</P>
<P>
Liu also called for local farmers to take part in a DPP-initiated
nationwide rally slated for March 26 to protest the law, which
provides the Chinese authorities with a legal basis for using
non-peaceful means against Taiwan if the island moves toward
independence.

ANTI-SECESSION LAW HELPS ENHANCE TAIWAN IDENTITY: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  15 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Tuesday that
China's enactment of its Anti-Secession Law means both a crisis and
an opportunity for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Fielding questions at a Legislative Yuan interpellation session,
Hsieh said the anti-secession legislation targeting Taiwan exposes
the true nature of China's bellicosity.
</P>
<P>
"The enactment of the Anti-Secession Law has made China the only
country in the world to codify war as a means of resolving disputes,"
Hsieh said, adding that the act runs against the mainstream world
trends of pursuing peace, reconciliation and co-existence.
</P>
<P>
China's rubber-stamp National People's Congress passed almost
unanimously the law that authorizes the use of "non-peaceful means"
to stop Taiwan from seeking formal independence.
</P>
<P>
"Such an ill-intentioned piece of legislation will only make the
world understand that China's conviction that power comes from the
barrel of a gun has not changed, " Hsieh said, adding that Beijing
has invited criticism from all over the world for enacting the
controversial law.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, he went on, Taiwan has invariably committed itself
to safeguarding peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and has
consistently sided with the democratic camp.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, the Anti-Secession Law has helped enhance
local people's consciousness of Taiwan's separate identity from that
of China, citing the results of the latest opinions polls that show
more than 90 percent of the respondents voiced opposition to China's
new legislation.
</P>
<P>
"Although we are all very angry at Beijing's ill-motivated
legislation, we must remain calm and refrain from any irrational
extreme reaction," Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer-turned-politician further said Beijing's new law has
actually altered the peaceful status quo across the Taiwan Strait and
that the present situation meets the requirement for Taiwan to hold a
defensive referendum to protect its sovereign status.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he continued, the nation should exercise
self-restraint to let the world understand that Taiwan is a
peace-loving country that is determined to make every possible effort
to protect cross-strait peace.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he will take part in a March 26 street parade to be
organized by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party to protest the
new law, Hsieh said: "As a Taiwanese I want to join but now I'm also
the premier and I have to consider (the consequences) . My presence
might give the impression that the activity is organized by the
government."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hsieh said that President Chen Shui-bian and the
National Security Council (NSC) are weighing the law's possible
impact on Taiwan from a broad perspective.
</P>
<P>
"The NSC will monitor international reaction as well as the
sentiments and feelings of the people on both sides of the strait
until the end of this month, " Hsieh said, adding that the government
will then decide whether and how to revise its cross-strait policy.
</P>
<P>
Before the deadline, Hsieh said the government will not consider
any proposal about the opening of cross-strait charter flights or
personnel and commercial exchange programs.

TAIWAN WINS INT'L SUPPORT IN DISPUTE WITH CHINA: FOREIGN MINISTRY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 15 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan has successfully exposed Beijing's
threat against regional security and is winning increasing support
from major powers in its dispute with Beijing, according to a report
presented to the Legislative Yuan by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Bracing for Beijing's enactment of its Anti-Secession Law, the
ministry said in its report that it sent out delegations to the
United States, Japan and European Union member states in January to
brief them of Taiwan's opinion that the proposed law is "undesirable,
unnecessary, unconstructive and stupid."
</P>
<P>
These delegations also reiterated Taiwan's stance on its disputes
with Beijing, namely that it should be settled peacefully through
dialogue and that neither side should alter the status quo in terms
of their relationship to each other.
</P>
<P>
The efforts paid off, the report said, citing White House Press
Secretary Scott McClellan as saying March 9 that Beijing's
legislation of the Anti-Secession Law runs counter to the recent
trends toward a warming in cross-strait relations, and urging Beijing
to reconsider passage of the law.
</P>
<P>
The European Union also believes that the Taiwan issue should be
solved peacefully through dialogue between Taiwan and China, and that
neither side should take action that could increase the tension
between them, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Minister of Foreign Affairs Nobutaka Machimura told
Beijing Feb. 23 about his country's strong desire for a peaceful
resolution of the Taiwan issue and about Japan's great concerns about
the negative impact of Beijing's law.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's security also become a cause for concern of the United
States and Japan, with a joint statement Feb. 19 saying that the
Taiwan Strait is one of their common strategic objectives, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's military buildup is also being questioned, said the
report, citing the Japanese government's latest Outline for National
Defense Plan, which says China's military modernization and its
increasing naval presence deserve Japanese notice.
</P>
<P>
Also, the report said, Porter J. Goss, director of the Central
Intelligence Agency of the United States, told the Senate Feb. 16
that China's military modernization is tilting the military balance
across the Taiwan Strait and is posing a threat to the U.S. armed
forces in the region.

Koizumi was reported as telling the parliament that his

Manila Bulletin: 23 dead in
jail assault

The crisis at the Metro Manila District Jail
(MMDJ) in Camp Bagong Diwa, Taguig came to a bloody
end before noon yesterday with 23 people killed -- 22
of them detained Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) members and
one policeman -- and six other lawmen wounded after
lawmen assaulted the jail to finish the stand-off with
the detainees who staged a jail uprising Monday
morning. 

The Philippine Daily Inquirer: Cops storm jail;
23 dead 

VIRTUALLY all they had were handguns but it was
clear to the police commandos that the Abu Sayyaf
bandits were ready to fight to the death. 

The Philippine Star: Troops storm jail; 23 dead

Loud explosions rocked a maximum security jail at
Camp Bagong Diwa in Bicutan, Taguig City yesterday
morning, heralding the start of an assault on the
facility by government troops to end a daylong
standoff with Abu Sayyaf detainees.

The Manila Times: 23 killed as cops storm Bicutan
jail

Twenty-three people including a policeman and
three top leaders of the Abu Sayyaf were killed when

: Abu Sayyaf chiefs killed as police storm
prison.

Three high-ranking Abu Sayyaf leaders were
killed in a failed jailbreak in the Philippines 
that left 28 people dead yesterday, but this will
do little damage to the Muslim terrorist group 
and may even aid recruitment, analysts say.

Galib Andang, alias Commander Robot;
Alhamzer Limbong, alias Commander Kosovo; and
Nadjmi Sabdulla, alias Commander Global, were
killed in a mid-morning assault on Manila's Camp
Bagong Diwa prison ordered by President Gloria
Arroyo.

The assault went ahead after more than 120
Abu Sayyaf members involved in the uprising
rejected an ultimatum to surrender following a
30-hour stand-off.

BEIJING LAW CONTRADICTS BASIC SPIRIT OF DEMOCRACY: PREMIER HSIEH
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 16 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Wednesday that
China's enactment of its Anti-Secession Law goes against the
fundamental spirit of democracy.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said that from the remarks and statements made by the
Chinese leadership over the last few days on the new law targeting
Taiwan, he has come to realize that the Chinese communists do not
have any sense of the principle of democracy.
</P>
<P>
"Our system is one which we chose freely, and our freedom of
choice cannot be deprived by any group of people with any
'non-peaceful means,'" Hsieh reiterated.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during an Executive Yuan meeting to weigh the
Anti-Secession Law's impact on Taiwan, the premier said that most of
the people in Taiwan are angry with the new law and that the
international community has also voiced its explicit opposition to
the law.
</P>
<P>
Noting that peace is a universal value, Hsieh stressed that the
Taiwan people and the international community will not stand for
Beijing's codifying of war as a means of resolving disputes.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said that Beijing's renewed threats are helping to further
consolidate the people of Taiwan. "At this crucial juncture, only
unity will make us strong, and the whole country should make
explicitly known our consciousness of Taiwan's separate identity from
that of China," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We must, however, express our consciousness of identity in a
peaceful manner, and nobody should resort to anything other than
peaceful means under any circumstances in this regard," he added.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh stressed that despite Beijing's mounting suppression and
provocation of Taiwan, the government is resolute in continuing to
push for reforms and national development.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the premier also said that the raising of the maximum
allowed daily fluctuation in the stock market from the current 7
percent to 15 percent will be put into effect "in due time."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the measure was originally set to be implemented
this September but that he has asked the Financial Supervisory
Commission to study related measures and put them into effect based
on considerations of both market development and stability.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh also pointed out that since Beijing's passage of the
controversial Anti-Secession Law Monday, Taiwan's bourse has
continued to perform within the normal range, indicating that the
island's economic development is mature and that investors are
confident about the country's future.

UNILATERAL MOVES NOT HELPFUL TO CROSS-STRAIT RELATIONS: RICE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  March 15 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unilateral moves are not helpful to
the development of cross-Taiwan Strait relations, U.S. Secretary of
State Condoleezza Rice said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Rice made the comments aboard her flight to India -- the first
stop of her six-nation Asian tour that will also take her to
Pakistan, Afghanistan, Japan, South Korea and China.
</P>
<P>
The United States "has a kind of upright anchor position, " Rice
said, adding that "it is our responsibility to say to both the
parties of China and Taiwan that unilateral moves that increase
tensions are really not helpful and that the Anti-Secession Law is
not helpful in reducing cross-strait tensions."
</P>
<P>
"And, therefore, we have said to the Chinese that we would have
hoped that this (enactment of the law) would not have been done, "
she said.
</P>
<P>
However, Rice added that enactment of the Anti-Secession Law
doesn't mean that China and Taiwan can't continue to try to improve
cross-strait relations and that talks shouldn't continue on the links
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure that investment continues, and it's important that we
recognize that they need to continue to pursue these positive goals.
We'll encourage both sides to continue to pursue the positive goals,"
Rice continued.
</P>
<P>
"But our 'one China' policy and the three communiques and the
responsibilities under the Taiwan Relations Act really demand that
the United States make clear to both parties that unilateral moves
are just not helpful," she reiterated.
</P>
<P>
On whether Beijing's enactment of the Anti-Secession Law will
have any effect on a possible lifting of the European Union's arms
embargo against China, Rice said that "it's obvious that the
Europeans are examining this issue. They know very well our views on
the arms embargo, that this is not a time to end the arms embargo."
</P>
<P>
"It's a time when Asia is in transition, when the military
balance needs to be maintained. It's a time when human rights
concerns continue coming out of Tiananmen, which was the original
reason for the arms embargo. But I would hope that it would at least
remind the Europeans that there are still serious security issues in
the region and in the Taiwan Strait in particular," she said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Christopher Hill, who
is expected to be named an assistant secretary of state for East
Asian and Pacific affairs, said Tuesday during a hearing at the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee that any other than peaceful means
should not be adopted to resolve cross-Taiwan Strait issues.
</P>
<P>
While responding to Sen. Lisa Murkowski's question about
Beijing's enactment of the Anti-Secession Law, Hill said that "this
type of measure, this type of law, is a unilateral approach. We have
to insist to both sides not to resort to unilateral approaches."

FOREIGN MINISTER CALLS FOR BEIJING TO GIVE TAIWAN ROOM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 16 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen
called for the Beijing authorities Wednesday to make room for Taiwan
in the international community and to allow Taiwan greater access to
global activities.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on speculation that Beijing will probably make some
concessions on the diplomatic front as a form of compensation to
Taiwan after passing its Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan, Chen
said that if China is sincere in wanting to mend fences with Taiwan,
it should help Taiwan improve its living space in the international
community and allow Taiwan to take part in activities of more global
organizations than just the World Health Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks at an interpellation session at the
Legislative Yuan Foreign Affairs Committee.
</P>
<P>
He said he had not been informed about the speculation through
"normal channels."
</P>
<P>
Opposition People First Party Legislator Sun Ta-chian asked Chen
whether Taiwan would accept China's help in taking part in the World
Health Assembly and its activities under a title that is acceptable
to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen answered that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would welcome
such an initiative, but added that if Beijing is sincere in wanting
to improve its relations with Taiwan, it should not restrict its
"goodwill" to one case involving only the WHA and related activities.
</P>
<P>
He added that his office has learned that the United States, like
last year, will continue to throw its support behind Taiwan this year
in its bid to enter the WHA as an observer.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chen said he considers the south Pacific nation of
Vanuatu to no longer be a diplomatic ally after a flip-flop on
bilateral ties since he and Vanuatu Prime Minister Serge Vohor signed
a communique in Taipei Nov. 2, 2004 to establish formal diplomatic
relations.
</P>
<P>
Although Vohor was ousted by the Vanuatu parliament in
mid-December and Beijing claimed that Vanuatu would repeal all
accords and consensuses reached with Taiwan, the MOFA has not been
formally informed by Vanuatu that the ties are null and void, Chen
noted.
</P>
<P>
As of today, the number of countries that maintain formal
diplomatic relations with the ROC is 25, he added.

KMT CHAIRMANSHIP ELECTION SET FOR JULY 16
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 16 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) decided
Wednesday to hold its next chairmanship election July 16 instead of
the originally scheduled May date.
</P>
<P>
According to a schedule finalized by the party's Central Standing
Committee, the party will publish details of the election May 16 and
accept registration from interested candidates from May 25 to June 8.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the KMT is expected to consider next week a proposal
to lift a party rule that prohibits party members who have not paid
their membership fees from running and voting in the chairmanship
election, according to KMT spokeswoman Cheng Li-wen.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said the party decided to hold the ballot in July because
there are already a number of other political events on the agenda
between March and June.
</P>
<P>
While the party is set to hold its preliminary for the year-end
magistrate and mayoral elections during the period, the election for
the ad hoc National Assembly is scheduled for May 14, Cheng pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
According to Cheng, KMT Chairman Lien Chan pledged during the
committee meeting that the next chairmanship election will be open
and fair.
</P>
<P>
Lien said the election should not be held in a hurried manner and
that people interested in running for the post should be given ample
opportunity to communicate with fellow party members face to face.
</P>
<P>
The KMT had originally planned to hold the election May 28 but
later changed its plan and came up with a proposal to hold the ballot
July 23.
</P>
<P>
The date was finally set at July 16 in the wake of criticism that
it would facilitate candidates to recruit new members into the party
to boost their chances of winning if the date set was July 23.
</P>
<P>
According to KMT rules, members gain the right to vote in the
chairmanship election after they have been party members for four
months.
</P>
<P>
There was also speculation that Lien favors Legislative Yuan
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng as his successor and that putting off the
election from May to July would give Wang an advantage over Taipei
Mayor Ma Ying-jeou in the chairmanship race.
</P>
<P>
Wang and Ma, who both serve as vice chairmen of the KMT, are
expected to run for the chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Wang urged the public to stop making such
speculation, saying that the date of the election was always subject
to change before it was finalized by the Central Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating his claim that all party members should be allowed to
vote in the election regardless of whether they have paid their
membership fees, Wang said a chairman who is elected by all 1.09
million members will naturally enjoy a broader mandate than one who
is elected by only 200,000 to 300,000 paid-up members.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ma said he is against postponing the chairmanship
election to July because it would spark a lot of unwarranted
speculation and damage the party's reputation.

COA HOPES TALKS LEAD TO EXPORTS OF TAIWAN FARM PRODUCE TO CHINA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  16  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's top official in charge of
agricultural affairs welcomed Wednesday recent news reports that
China is prepared to allow Taiwan farm produce to make inroads into
the Chinese market, but suggested that the two sides build up
channels for communication and consultation first.
</P>
<P>
Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, Lee Chin-long,
chairman of the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture, said that the
council has worked out preliminary guidelines to oversee Taiwan farm
produce exports to China.
</P>
<P>
Under these guidelines, the COA will invite Taiwan's intermediary
body, the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) to hold talks and
communication with the Chinese authorities to facilitate the exports,
Lee said.
</P>
<P>
If the SEF cannot take up this mission, he went on, then the SEF
can recommend qualified organizations from the private sector to
conduct the talks on the Taiwan side.
</P>
<P>
"Negotiations and consultations are essential before the
agricultural products can head toward China," Lee added.
</P>
<P>
He noted, however, that Beijing's passage of the Anti-Secession
Law targeting Taiwan Monday has landed a blow on efforts to warm up
bilateral exchanges across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Anti-Secession Law has hurt the feelings of the
Taiwan people, Lee told the legislators that the COA will "wait and
see" how the situation unfolds before making a prudent judgment on
its export policies.

ONLY TAIWAN PEOPLE CAN DECIDE  NATION'S FUTURE: PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his first public response to the
passage of China's Anti-Secession Law, President Chen Shui-bian said
Wednesday that only the 23 million people of Taiwan can decide the
island's future and that Beijing has no say in the matter.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks at the Presidential Office when he
received participants in a workshop for Global Alliance for Democracy
and Peace regional chapter leaders.
</P>
<P>
The National People's Congress, China's rubber-stamp parliament,
passed almost unanimously the Anti-Secession Law Monday, authorizing
the use of "non-peaceful means" against Taiwan should the island move
toward independence.
</P>
<P>
The president reminded the public that Beijing is used to a
double-handed, carrot-and-stick approach and that they should not be
fooled by it.
</P>
<P>
One million Taiwan people are expected to take to the streets
March 26 to say that "more than 2,000 delegates of China's National
People's Congress cannot decide the fate of the 23 million people of
Taiwan, and that only the great Taiwan people can decide Taiwan's
future with freedom, democracy and peace," the president said.
</P>
<P>
In a six-point statement, Chen expressed his grave concerns and
regret over the newly passed law on behalf of the government.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the Republic of China is a sovereign and
independent country and that 90 percent of the people believe that
only the people of Taiwan have the right to decide on the country's
future.
</P>
<P>
If Beijing leaders really "pin hopes on Taiwan people" as they 
claimed, they should listen to the voice of the majority of Taiwan
people, accept the fact of the existence of the Republic of China and
respect the choice of Taiwan people in free will.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's enactment of the law has shown the stark differences in
the systems on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, but the resolution of
the differences will not be achieved by the Anti-Secession Law, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that "both sides should solve bilateral differences
through dialogue based on the principles of democracy, freedom and
peace, " and that "any undemocratic or non-peaceful means, no matter
under what pretenses, will not be condoned by the international
community and will only further divide cross-strait relations and
cause the peoples on both sides to drift further apart."
</P>
<P>
The president noted that despite the international community's
overwhelming opposition to the law and repeated appeals not to enact
the law, Beijing has turned a deaf ear and went ahead with the 
legislation.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "any laws that advocate the use of force, no
matter for what reasons or excuses, are a smear of the universal
values of freedom, democracy and human rights and a regression of
human civilization."
</P>
<P>
The president said the Taiwan people love peace and are
determined to safeguard the country's democratic system. Although he
is happy to see the emergence of China, he said Beijing has continued
to engage in military expansion for a long time, increased its
missile deployments targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen again appealed to the European Union not to lift a
16-year-old arms embargo against a potential invader before Beijing
guarantees peace and renounces "non-peaceful means" to take Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He said the law is Beijing's attempt to unilaterally change the
status quo in the Taiwan Strait, which has resulted in a most grave
negative impact on cross-strait relations, which were eased somewhat
in the wake of cross-strait charter flights during the Chinese New
Year holiday.
</P>
<P>
He said Taiwan is willing to share its development experience
with China, saying that Taiwan can offer its "democratic system,
complete freedom and human rights protection."
</P>
<P>
Finally, the president appealed for public participation in a
protest march March 26, saying that as the international community
opposes the law, the Taiwan people must not remain silent.
</P>
<P>
The march will be the "most peaceful, rational and humble" voice
of Taiwan people to say "no" to the law, the president said.

SEATTLE-BASED PRODIGY TO RETURN TO TAIWAN ON EDUCATION PROMOTION TOUR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 16 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Andrew D. Hsu, a 13-year-old prodigy
university student in Seattle, Washington, is scheduled to come to
Taiwan this Friday to raise funds for his World Children Organization
activities aimed at providing poor children with English learning
materials.
</P>
<P>
Hsu, currently a student at the University of Washington and
expected to obtain a bachelor of science degree next year, has been
working on the compilation of a 130-volume series of basic
English-learning books in the hope that initially, 10,000 sets can be
printed to be distributed to poor children worldwide who have no
access to education, according to Hsu's grandfather, who still lives
in Taipei after his son and daughter-in-law emigrated to Seattle when
the child was a baby.
</P>
<P>
Hsu and his younger brother Patrick jointly established the World
Children Organization in 2002, committed to consolidating global
resources and strengths to help poor children without access to
education, food or shelter.
</P>
<P>
Hsu, who received admission from the University of Washington at
10 but delayed his enrollment until he was 12, said in a videotape
that some charitable organizations provide poor children with food,
clothes, clean water and medical care, and some help build schools
for them, but almost no organization provides basic education to
needy children to allow them to learn by themselves.
</P>
<P>
The World Children Organization English books will help the needy
children to learn English on a self-taught basis, even if they have
no class to attend and no teacher to listen to, said Hsu.
</P>
<P>
Hsu is scheduled to stay in Taiwan for one week and is expected
to call on Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh and leaders of
several public-interest organizations.
</P>
<P>
In addition to raising funds for his books, he is also expected
to pick up some tips in Taiwan on how to establish and operate a
foundation of funds, according to his grandfather.

CABINET APPROVES PROPOSED ARMS PROCUREMENT STATUTE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 16 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cabinet approved during its weekly
meeting Wednesday a proposed "statute for major arms procurement" put
forth for the second time by the Ministry of National Defense.
</P>
<P>
A similar bill regarding the government's latest plan to buy six
Patriot PAC-III anti-missile batteries, eight diesel-electric
submarines and a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft from the
United States was passed by the Cabinet and sent to the previous
legislature for consideration last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the proposed statute, together with a proposed budget
for the procurement, was shelved by the legislature owing to
objections from the majority "pan-blue alliance" of the opposition
Kuomintang and People First Party. With the proposed statute and
budget technically killed at the end of the last legislative term in
January this year, the Cabinet had to submit them again to the new
legislature that started Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
The ceiling for the procurement package was marked down from the
original NT$610.8 billion to NT$480 billion (US$15.48 billion) in the
new proposal because a plan to make the submarines in Taiwan was
dropped, while the new Taiwan dollar has appreciated against the U.S.
dollar, officials said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Premier Frank Hsieh urged the Legislative
Yuan to pass the proposed statute as soon as possible to maintain the
government's credibility and the country's defense capabilities.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh also ordered the relevant authorities to step up
communication with the public and lawmakers to win their support for
the important statute and budget.
</P>
<P>
According to Cabinet spokesman Cho Jung-tai, the government will
not be able to go ahead with the procurement unless the statute is
passed by the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Cho said the government is under intense time pressure, as the
agreed amount and items of the procurement might change if there are
further delays.

BUSH URGED TO VOICE GRAVE CONCERN OVER ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  March 16 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of U. S. congressmen jointly
introduced a resolution Monday urging President George W. Bush to
voice the grave concern on the adoption of the Anti- Secession Law by
Beijing earlier that day.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, initiated by Henry Hyde, chairman of the
International Relations Committee under the House of Representatives,
asks Bush to express the U. S. government's opposition to the law and
its worry that the law might unilaterally change the status quo
across the Taiwan Strait by non-peaceful means on Beijing's part.
</P>
<P>
Citing a report in 2004 by the Department of Defense on China's
military power, the resolution points out that Beijing had deployed
about 500 short-range ballistic missiles aimed at Taiwan and that the
arms buildup of missiles and other offensive weapons by Beijing in
the areas adjacent to the Taiwan Strait poses threat to the peace and
security of the Western Pacific.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Relations Act, enacted in 1979, makes it clear that
Washington's decision to set up diplomatic relations with Beijing
rested upon the expectation that the future of Taiwan should be
determined by peaceful means with the consent of the people in
Taiwan, the resolution says.
</P>
<P>
It is Washington's policy to maintain the capacity of the United
States to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion that
would jeopardize the security or the social or economic system of the
people in Taiwan, it says.
</P>
<P>
The resolution puts forward the following four key points:
</P>
<P>
1. China's Anti-Secession Law provides a legal justification for
the use of force against Taiwan, altering the status quo in the
region and thus posing grave concern to the United States;
</P>
<P>
2. the president should direct all appropriate United States
government officials to reflect the grave concern with which the
United States views the adoption of the Anti-Secession Law in
particular, and the growing Chinese military threat to Taiwan in
general, to their counterpart officials in the government of the
People's Republic of China;
</P>
<P>
3. the government of the United States should reaffirm its policy
that the future of Taiwan should be resolved by peaceful means and
with the consent of the people of Taiwan; and
</P>
<P>
4. the government of the United States should continue to
encourage dialogue between Taiwan and the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
The resolution is expected to be approved Wednesday by the House,
sources from the Congress said.

TAITRA BOOSTS EFFORTS TO PROMOTE TRADE WITH SPAIN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Madrid,  March 15 (CNA)
(By T.L. Chang and Elizabeth Hsu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan has listed Spain as one of its key
trade targets with efforts being made to boost Taiwan-Spain economic
and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
Walter M.S. Yeh, vice president of the semi-official Taiwan
External Trade Development Council (TAITRA), was scheduled to sign an
agreement with Madrid Chamber of Commerce (MCC) General Director Jose
Maria Isardo Wednesday at the MCC headquarters to boost the council's
cooperative relations with the Spanish business group, an economics
official at the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Madrid said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Ming-shih, chief of the office's economic division, pointed
out that under the agreement, the existing business information
service to businesses of the two countries will be reinforced, while
the TAITRA and MCC will make joint efforts to organize trade fairs
and exchange visits.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that following the signing ceremony, Yeh will deliver a
speech to introduce the investment environment and trade
opportunities in Taiwan. Chen will then inform Spanish participants
in the event of Taiwan's official statistics concerning bilateral
cooperative ties in trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, TAITRA has decided to open a branch office in
Barcelona to promote Taiwan-Spain trade and investment relations,
preparations for which are already being made, according to the
group, which is Taiwan's foremost non-profit trade promotion
organization.
</P>
<P>
According to the economic division's statistics, in 2004 Taiwan
exports to Spain reached US$970.5 million, posting a growth of 20.9
percent over the level of the previous year, while imports from Spain
amounted to 370.1 million euros, representing a growth 16.6 percent.

OPPOSITION AFFIRMS PRESIDENT'S RESPONSE TO BEIJING'S LAW

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First
Party (PFP), the two major opposition parties that are often at odds
with President Chen Shui-bian on political issues, unanimously
affirmed Chen's restrained response to Beijing's Anti-Secession Law
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Chen Chie, the whip of the KMT caucus at the
Legislative Yuan, said the president, as head of state, should voice
the people's rejection of and resentment toward Beijing's
Anti-Secession Law, which provides China with a legal basis for using
force against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
However, Taiwan's dispute with China cannot be solved through
confrontation and the leaders of the two sides should use their
wisdom to steer their countries clear of the fruitless political
struggle, Chen Chie said.
</P>
<P>
Their attention would be better used to address problems
concerning their people's daily lives, the KMT lawmaker said.
</P>
<P>
He refused to comment on a March 26 protest initiated by the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party, saying that the individual
members of the public can decide for themselves whether or not to
participate.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Chen Chih-ping, the convener of the PFP caucus at the
Legislative Yuan, said the president made a good point when he told
visiting foreign dignities earlier in the day that Taiwan 's future
should be determined by its 23 million people rather than by the
2,000-odd members of Beijing's National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
The PFP legislator, however, claimed that the president knows
better than to take part in the March 26 protest, as doing so would
indicate that he is at the end of his tether in terms of countering
Beijing's intimidation.
</P>
<P>
"As head of state, Chen better keep a cool head in the face of
Beijing's provocation and he should not drop any hints that might
make Beijing think he feels forced into a corner," the lawmaker said.

<P>
Visiting Republic of China Vice
President Annette Lu said Tuesday that she wishes to share Taiwan's
experience with El Salvador to make the Central American country a
regional business operation center.
</P>
<P>
Lu made the remarks while attending a seminar on the Taiwan-El
Salvador industrial park project on the second day of her three-day
visit to the country. Also in attendance were El Salvador Vice
President Ana Vilma De Escobar; Patricia Figueroa, head of the
national investment promotion board; and Sandra de Barraza from the
National Development Committee.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that this was her third visit to El Salvador, and that
she came with friendship the first time, with best wishes the second
time, and this time with Taiwan's "experience and dreams" to share.
</P>
<P>
ROC Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-long also spoke
on plans to build the industrial park.
</P>
<P>
The industrial park will mark the first time government and the
private sector will have joined forces to build an industrial park in
El Salvador, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The park is initially planned at 200 hectares and will introduce
agriculture and livestock technology, aquaculture, manufacturing and
processing, warehousing and transportation, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan and El Salvador will soon set up a committee to hammer out
the details of the project, Chen said, expressing the hope that the
government of El Salvador will provide tax incentives, low-interest
loans, and establish a fast clearing system in airports and harbors
to lure Taiwan companies to set up shop in the park.
</P>
<P>
He also urged El Salvador to sign a free trade agreement (FTA)
with Taiwan to upgrade bilateral trade exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Escobar said that El Salvador, at the center of
America, has signed an FTA with neighboring countries, such as the
United States and Canada, which will help Taiwan businessmen make
inroads into the North American market.
</P>
<P>
She promised that her country will provide all necessary
assistance to the investment project.
</P>
<P>
Lu and her entourage then traveled to the site of the projected
park near Comalapa International Airport.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, Lu attended a luncheon hosted by Escobar.
</P>
<P>
Lu spoke at the luncheon of her childhood, studies, having been
diagnosed with cancer as well as her life in jail after the
"Kaohsiung Incident, " a peaceful rally to mark international human
rights day that turned violent in 1979.
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon, Lu was bestowed with an honorary doctorate at
Dr. Jose Matias Delgado University and delivered a speech there.
</P>
<P>
Lu also announced that Taiwan will offer full scholarships to
three students from the school every year to study in Taiwan for
their master's degree.
</P>
<P>
The vice president noted that both countries are similar in size
and populations, and both face the threat of communism, although the
threat to El Salvador comes from civil war, while the threat to
Taiwan comes from China across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Lu is scheduled to meet with El Salvador President Elias Antonio
Saca Wednesday and will then hold a news conference. She will also
deliver a speech to the El Salvador Parliament later that day.

Nothing militarily out of the ordinary is

Lu's comments came after Premier Frank Hsieh said that the
enactment of the Anti-Secession Law by China Monday has changed the

Lu, currently visiting El Salvador on her two-nation visit of

DPP HOPES FOR QUICK REVIEW OF PROPOSED ARMS PROCUREMENT STATUTE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 16 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A leading ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) legislator Wednesday expressed the hope that the
opposition-controlled legislature will start reviewing the
Cabinet-proposed "statute for major arms procurement" soon.
</P>
<P>
Lai Ching-teh, a whip of the DPP legislative caucus, said he
hopes the proposed statute can be included in the agenda of
Legislative Yuan for March 25 and passed on to a legislative
committee for review.
</P>
<P>
The proposed statute regarding a plan to buy six Patriot PAC-III
anti-missile batteries, eight diesel-electric submarines and a
squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft from the United States
was approved by the Cabinet earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the DPP caucus on the arms procurement, Minister of
National Defense Lee Jye stressed that the three kinds of weapons are
most needed by the Republic of China military.
</P>
<P>
Lee explained that the amount of the procurement has been reduced
from the original NT$610.8 billion to NT$480 billion (US$15.48
billion) because the government has dropped a plan to make the
submarines in Taiwan, while the new Taiwan dollar has appreciated
against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the procurement needs to be covered by a special budget
since the government will have a difficult time including such a
large amount in its regular budget.
</P>
<P>
A similar proposed statute, together with a proposed special
budget for the procurement, was shelved and technically killed by the
previous legislature owing to objections from the majority "pan-blue
alliance" of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party
(PFP), which thought the package was too expensive.
</P>
<P>
Lai Hsin-yuan, a leader of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union
legislative caucus, said her party will definitely support the arms
procurement.
</P>
<P>
However, Lai said NT$480 billion is still an exorbitant amount
and she urged the Ministry of National Defense to bargain with the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, PFP legislative caucus convener Chen Chih-pin said his
party insists that any arms procurement must be covered by the
government's regular budget instead of a special budget.
</P>
<P>
Lin Yu-fang, a PFP legislator who serves as a convener of the
National Defense Committee, said the arms procurement will do little
help to defending Taiwan against the imminent threat from China
because the submarines will only be delivered to Taiwan nine to 15
years after an order is placed.
</P>
<P>
Holding a similar view with the PFP, KMT legislative caucus whip
Chen Chieh said adjusting the amount of the arms procurement does not
mean the actual prices of the weapons have become less and that the
party still insists that the procurement be included in the
government's regular budget.

TSU CALLS FOR PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR MARCH 26 RALLY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 16 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) called
Wednesday for public support for the March 26 protest in Taipei
against Beijing's adoption of the Anti-Secession Law aimed at
quelling Taiwan independence.
</P>
<P>
Lo Chih-ming, a TSU whip at the Legislative Yuan, issued the call
echoing President Chen Shui-bian's appeal earlier the same day that
"Taiwan's future must be determined by its 23 million people and
Taiwan people should speak out loudly their desire for freedom,
democracy and peace by taking part in the demonstration."
</P>
<P>
Voicing the TSU's full agreement with the president's stance, Lo
said that all the people in Taiwan should throw their backing behind
the president to help him better deter Beijing's threats. He
suggested amending the Referendum Law to allow the people to directly
express their viewpoints on Taiwan's future.
</P>
<P>
Former President Lee Teng-hui, spiritual leader of the
independence-minded TSU, has publicly showed his willingness to
participate in the large-scale protest in a display of solidarity
with the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).
</P>
<P>
DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang announced last week that the party
would organize a massive rally and he claimed that at least one
million people would take to the streets to show their fierce
objection to the Anti-Secession Law.

of how the integration of the two forms could enhance the entire
exhibition and further develop tourism.
</P>
<P>
Masks from Honduras will be on display at the show, Villela said,
adding that her country's cultural affairs department will send two
artists to Taiwan to tape the festival for reference should Honduras
decide to put on a similar show.

ANTI-SECESSION LAW NOT IN FORM ACCEPTABLE TO BOTH SIDES: WANG DAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Los Angeles, March 15 (CNA)
(By Laurence Chiu and Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Democracy, rather than a law, is the
key to Beijing's desire for unification with Taiwan, Wang Dan, a
prominent former student leader at the 1989 Tiananmen Square
democracy movement in Beijing, said Tuesday in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting with the Chinese-language media, Wang said
that mainland China's democratization is the best remedy for Beijing
to achieve eventual unification with Taiwan. He said that its
Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan independence is not in a form
acceptable to both sides of the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, eventual Taiwan-mainland unification must be
accomplished in a way that is acceptable to both sides. Only mainland
China's democratization will keep Taiwan under its wing, he
commented, adding that "the sooner this happens, the better."
</P>
<P>
He also termed the Anti-Secession Law as unwise at a time when
cross-strait relations have shown signs of warming after the special
lunar new year charter flights and Taiwan's legislative elections
late last year.
</P>
<P>
Wang, now in exile in the United States, studies at Harvard
University.

CHEN REITERATES OFFER OF PEACEFUL RESOLUTION TO CROSS-STRAIT DISPUTES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  16  (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian reiterated
Wednesday that Taiwan is willing to resolve disputes between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Receiving a visiting Iceland parliamentary delegation at the
Presidential Office, Chen told his guests that the international
community should not agree with Beijing's intention of using
"non-peaceful means" against Taiwan as stipulated in its recently
passed Anti-Recession Law.
</P>
<P>
Democracy, freedom and protection of human rights are three of
Taiwan's characteristics that the people on China have not yet
enjoyed, Chen noted, adding that he hopes the democratic achievements
made by Taiwan can serve as a beacon for China.
</P>
<P>
Criticizing the recent passage of China's Anti-Secession Law by
its rubber-stamp parliament -- the National People's Congress -- that
authorizes Beijing authorities to resort to "non--peaceful means"
against Taiwan, Chen emphasized that no foreign countries'
parliaments can decide the future of Taiwan and only the 23 million
people of Taiwan can do this.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized the exclusion of Taiwan from the United
Nations and the World Health Organization, claiming that this
violates the U.N. principle of universality, the spirit of health
without boundaries and the Taiwan people's rights to enjoy the best
health care available.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the international community should not discriminate
against the people of Taiwan, Chen pledged that his government will
continue to seek international support for and recognition of the
Taiwan people's rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
Chen expressed his appreciation and support for a proposal by
Solveig Petursdottir, chairperson of the Iceland Parliament Foreign
Affairs Committee and head of the delegation, to establish a liaison
office in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen told his guests that he hopes the proposal can be made a
reality as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The five-member Iceland parliamentary delegation and their
spouses arrived in Taipei Monday for a six-day visit.

OVERSEAS CHINESE GROUP DENOUNCES BEIJING'S ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 16 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An overseas Chinese group threw its weight
behind Taiwan in its disagreement with China over Beijing's
Anti-Secession Law, which permits an attack on Taiwan under certain
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
The Global Alliance for Democracy and Peace, which was organized
in 2002 by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission under the
Executive Yuan, said in a statement issued in Taipei that the
Republic of China is an independent country owned by its 23 million
people. It is separate from China and any alternation to its current
status should be based on the consent of its people.
</P>
<P>
It said that the Anti-Secession Law is just another piece of
evidence showing China's ignorance of the political reality
prevailing across the Taiwan Strait. It also shows China's abject
carelessness about how the people of Taiwan feel and the
international community's concerns.
</P>
<P>
In light of the current international trend of solving disputes
through peaceful means, the statement said, China's unveiled attempts
to use force against Taiwan are doomed to be condemned by the whole
world.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the United States and Japan have expressed
disapproval of the Anti-Secession Law and have made it clear that
their defence alliance would apply to the Taiwan Strait and the area
around it, the statement said China is threatening stability in the
region by falling afoul of its neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
The statement urged major powers in the Asian-Pacific region to
allow Taiwan to take part in their group security system to improve
the peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
It also called on Chinese the world over to understand the evil
character of the Communist Chinese regime.

quarter of last year, up 20 percent over the previous year's level,

COUNTIES CHIEFS AND COUNCILORS TO BE ELECTED AT SAME TIME IN 2009
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Chiefs and councilors for counties and
cities will be elected simultaneously in 2009, Minister of the
Interior Su Jia-chyuan said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with CNA, Su said the decision was made in line
with former Premier Yu Shyi-kun's instruction to cut down the number
of elections held in the counties.
</P>
<P>
According to Yu, the national elections, such as those for the
president and legislators, and local elections, such as those for
county/city chiefs and councilors, would best be held alternately
every two years.
</P>
<P>
As the terms of the chiefs and the councilors are the same --
four years -- it would be relatively easier to have them elected at
the same time, Su said. 
</P>
<P>
However, since the chiefs of counties and cities are set to be
elected in December this year, while the councilors are due for
election next March, Su said it would be too hasty to move the
councilor's elections ahead to the same time as the elections for the
city/county chiefs now.
</P>
<P>
That means they will be held together in 2009 at the earliest, Su
said.
</P>
<P>
As to the synchronization of national elections, the minister
said, it entails the revision of certain laws and his ministry is
still working on the revisions; hopefully, they will be approved by
the Legislative Yuan before the next national elections.

CHINA DRAWS AVALANCHE OF INTERNATIONAL CRITICISM: MAC CHIEF

<TEXT>
<P>
China has drawn an avalanche of criticism
ever since its enactment of the controversial Anti-Secession Law
which permits it to attack Taiwan under certain circumstances,
Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Citing statistics compiled by the Government Information Office,
Wu said there have been more than 1,700 overseas stories which cast
the law in a negative light and have brought enormous pressure on
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The MAC chief said major global powers such as the United States,
Japan, the European Union, Australia, Canada and others have
expressed, in very strong words, their disapproval of China's
legislation and the numbers are increasing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
Stunned by the huge backlash, Wu said, China is scrambling to
control the damage by trying to reach out to Taiwan, but all its
proposals, such as an open market to Taiwan agricultural products,
are insignificant.

FOREIGN WORKERS NEEDED TO SPEED UP TUNNEL CONSTRUCTION: MOTC
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  17  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC) hopes to import 200 foreign workers to help
speed up construction of the Shueishan Tunnel, the centerpiece of the
Peiyi Freeway project, an official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
An average of 1,500 workers are now working on the Shueishan
Tunnel project, the official said, adding that more workers are
needed to ensure smooth completion of the freeway before the end of
this year as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Because of the tough working conditions, the official said, local
people have been reluctant to work on the construction project.
</P>
<P>
"We have long faced a serious labor shortage problem, " the
official said, adding that the MOTC hopes the Council of Labor
Affairs can allow the ministry to import some 200 foreign workers for
the project on a special case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
Boring on the Shueishan Tunnel, also known as a "tunnel beneath
troubled waters" for its engineering difficulties, began 13 years
ago. After many twists and turns, the earth boring work of the
12.9-km tunnel was finally completed last September.
</P>
<P>
The Shueishan Tunnel has been called one of the most challenging
road construction projects in the world. It is the longest highway
tunnel in Asia and the fifth longest in the world.
</P>
<P>
Construction has long been delayed because of the special
geological formation of Shueishan (Mount Snow) through which the
tunnel passes. Construction on the 31-km Peiyi Freeway which links
Taipei to Ilan began in 1991. Boring work has often been halted due
to the frequent welling up of water at the construction site as well
as mud slides.
</P>
<P>
Because of the engineering difficulties, no insurance company has
been willing to provide safety coverage for the project. MOTC
Minister Lin Ling-san once said that whoever manages to bear through
to the completion of the Shueishan Tunnel will secure a place in
Taiwan's engineering history.
</P>
<P>
When the freeway is completed by the end of 2005, driving from
Taipei to Ilan will take only 40 minutes, compared to the two hours
required at present.

Manila Bulletin: Abu Sayyaf
dead laid to rest

The remains of the 22 suspected members of the Abu
Sayyaf Group (ASG), who were killed by policemen in
the Tuesday assault at the Metro Manila District Jail
(MMDJ) in Bicutan, Taguig City were buried yesterday
at the Muslim Cemetery also in Taguig. 

The Philippine Daily Inquirer: 22 Abus buried as
'martyrs' 

TO MANY, the 22 were plain bandits. To their
relatives, they were martyrs and buried them as such.
Two of them had been accused of beheading hostages in
the days when they terrorized civilian communities.
One was linked to the torching of a town in Zamboanga
del Sur province in which more than 50 people were
killed.

The Philippine Star: Sayyaf victims shed no tears

Victims of the Abu Sayyaf are happy that some of
its most notorious leaders have been put out of
business. The family of former Abu Sayyaf hostage
Gracia Burnham expressed relief yesterday at the
outcome of the standoff between Philippine government
forces and rioting detainees at Camp Bagong Diwa in
Taguig City that led to the killing of three notorious
bandit leaders. 

The Manila Times: Alit: Jails escape-prone

The country's run down prisons are conducive to
escape, officials admitted Wednesday, noting the
failed jailbreak by Abu Sayyaf militants that ended in
a bloody prison uprising, leaving close to 30 dead.

: Many more S'poreans are obese.

Many more Singaporeans are overweight and

and diabetes than was previously thought.

The conclusion follows the Government's
revision yesterday of its guidelines on the ideal
ratio of weight to height, measured by the 
widely-used international measure called body 
mass index, or BMI.

With the change, which comes about after
studies showed Asians have 4 to 5 per cent more 
body fat than similarly-built Caucasians, half 
the population will now be classified as 
overweight or obese.

This up from 30 per cent before.

police, with over 500 more offenders nabbed last
year, despite well-publicised campaigns to stem
the tide. The 2929 arrested last year surpassed
the 2389 figure for 2003.

Increased enforcement was behind the

LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER ANNOUNCES BID FOR KMT CHAIRMANSHIP
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 17 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng
announced Thursday his bid for the chairmanship of the opposition
Kuomintang, whose election is set for July 16.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference, Wang expounded his ideals for party
reforms following the party's consecutive losses in the 2000 and 2004
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the Legislative Yuan will play a pivotal role in
the reforms and will play the role of a checks-and-balances force.
</P>
<P>
The party will also make efforts to try to win elections at all
levels in the hopes of building a solid basis for regaining the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
On the controversial issue of the KMT's assets, Wang said that he
will handle the issue properly if elected so that it won't be a
persistent burden to the party. At the same time, he vowed to protect
the rights and livelihood of current and retired party workers amid
recent reports that the party is trying to streamline due to
financial problems.
</P>
<P>
On concerns that the race for party chairmanship between himself
and Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, both of whom are KMT vice chairmen,
might turn into a confrontation between the two and in turn divide
the party, Wang said: "Actually, there will only be cooperation, not
confrontation, between us."
</P>
<P>
Although the person who wins the KMT chairmanship is widely
expected to have a strong advantage in vying to be the "pan-blue
alliance" candidate in the 2008 presidential election, Wang said that
he would have the national interests in mind when considering whether
to run in the presidential election and that everything would depend
on the "public will."
</P>
<P>
"As long as the ideal of regaining ruling power can be realized,
I'll devote myself to accomplishing the historical task, although
success will not depend on myself alone," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and its two
splinter parties, the People First Party (PFP) and the New Party,
have to unite and cooperate in response to the aspirations of the
voters.
</P>
<P>
If there is no cooperation among the three parties, there will
be no possibility of winning the 2008 presidential election, Wang
said, adding that "this is the destiny of the trio, and the leaders
of the three parties have to face it honestly."
</P>
<P>
Wang also said that if elected as party chairman, he will stick
to the official names of the party as well as the nation and that the
Constitution of the Republic of China will not be abrogated.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 incumbent KMT legislators and 60 former legislators
attended the press conference, showing the immense popularity of the
10-term legislator. Two of Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou's supporters,
namely KMT Legislator Wu Yu-sheng, who formerly served as a Taipei
City Government spokesman, and New Party Legislator Lai Shyh-bao,
also attended on Ma's behalf.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mayor Ma, pointing to Wang's background and style,
expressed confidence that the race for the KMT chairmanship will be a
"battle between two gentlemen."
</P>
<P>
As Thursday was Wang's 65th birthday, Ma also sent a birthday
cake and flowers to him to express his best wishes.

CHINA'S SUBMARINES IN STRAIT MEAN MORE THAN BLOCKADE: MAC
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 17 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Joseph Wu said Thursday that China's submarine deployment in the
Taiwan Strait indicates a "higher strategic ambition" than blockading
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Wu urged the international community to take the situation
seriously and take measures to deal with the problem.
</P>
<P>
Wu told the legislature's Home and Nations Committee that three
shipbuilders on China are currently rushing submarine construction
orders placed by the Chinese military.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Ming-class, Song-class and Yuan-class
submarines, China is equipped with Type-093 and Type-094
nuclear-powered attack submarines and has purchased a total of 12
Kilo-class submarines from Russia, Wu pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Wu said blockading the Taiwan Strait does not require such a
large number of submarines and China obviously has a "higher
strategic ambition" than that.
</P>
<P>
On the government's plan to promote cross-strait charter cargo
flights, Wu said the special cross-strait charter flight service
provided during this year's Chinese Lunar New Year holiday could be a
model for the government to follow while arranging charter cargo
flights.
</P>
<P>
However, after the recent enactment of the Anti-Secession Law by
Beijing, the ROC government will have to assess the changes in
cross-strait relations to decide when and how cross-strait talks on
the charter cargo flights will be conducted, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will protect the interests of the country
and its people while carrying out the policy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a report to the legislature's Foreign and Overseas
Chinese Affairs Committee, MAC Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san said
China's Anti-Secession Law is aimed at declaring to the international
community that the Taiwan issue is an internal affair and is a
confrontation of the United States' Taiwan Relations Act.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said the Anti-Secession Law dictates unification as the only
option for the ultimate development of cross-strait relations and
defines a legal basis for China to annex Taiwan by force, which he
said is tantamount to unilaterally proclaiming a change in the
cross-strait status quo.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's law contradicts the cross-strait reality in which
Taiwan and China are independent of each other and increases the
uncertainties across the Taiwan Strait and in the Asia-Pacific
region, Chiu said.
</P>
<P>
By enacting the law, Beijing is also trying to temper nationalist
sentiments on China and deal a blow to the pro-independence movement
in Taiwan, according to Chiu.
</P>
<P>
He said the law symbolizes that China's cross-strait policy has
shifted from "promoting unification" politically to "compelling
unification" legally.
</P>
<P>
He warned the development will increase Taiwan people's
resentment towards China, intensify cross-strait confrontation and
hinder cross-strait exchanges and the resumption of dialogue.

PREMIER PLEDGES TO END FLOODING IN TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 17 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Thursday that the
Cabinet will introduce an eight-year, NT$80 billion (US$2.58 billion)
flood-prevention project in an attempt to end flooding in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the remarks while inspecting the construction of the
Yuanshantzu flood-prevention sluice along the Keelung River.
</P>
<P>
With the construction work having been delayed after the
half-completed facility was used to help drain flood water from the
Keelung River during typhoon season last year, Hsieh ordered that the
construction be completed by May.
</P>
<P>
Calling flooding a symbol of backwardness, Hsieh said the problem
should not be allowed to continue in a country where people enjoy an
average per capita income of nearly US$15,000.
</P>
<P>
According to Hsieh, the Cabinet currently only earmarks NT$1
billion every year to subsidize the flood-control projects for local
governments, which would take more than 80 years to resolve the
flooding problem.
</P>
<P>
Under these circumstances, the Cabinet plans to funnel NT$80
billion over eight years into a comprehensive project to resolve the
problem 70 years early, Hsieh said.

BEIJING INCAPABLE OF LAUNCHING FULL ATTACK ON TAIWAN AT PRESENT: MND
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 17 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China's military is currently incapable of
launching a full attack on Taiwan across the Taiwan Strait, Minister
of National Defense Lee Jye said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, if Taiwan doesn't purchase from the United States the
package of six Patriot PAC-III anti-missile batteries, eight
diesel-electric submarines and a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine
aircraft, Beijing will be able to attack Taiwan between 2020 and
2035, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Lee made the remarks while reporting on a special budget for arms
procurement to the National Defense Committee at the Legislative
Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the Anti-Secession Law shows China's intention to invade
Taiwan. This, coupled with its military expansion and various of
drills and exercises every year, points to the fact that Beijing is
actively preparing to wage war against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the establishment of missile defenses and the
capability to repel an attempt at blockading the island are the most
urgent tasks for the ministry, Taiwan definitely needs the U.S. arms
package, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the amount of the procurement has been marked
down from the original NT$610.8 billion to NT$475.9 billion
(US$15.48 billion) because the government has dropped a plan to make
the submarines in Taiwan, while the new Taiwan dollar has appreciated
against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Tang Huo-sheng of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party said that the passage of the Anti-Secession Law by Beijing has
created a degree of uncertainty, and wondered if more weaponry should
be acquired.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that the ministry has estimated what weaponry is
required using computer models, and the present package should meet
current needs.
</P>
<P>
Independent Legislator Li Ao pointed out that U.S. officials
recently expressed to James Soong, chairman of the People First
Party, during the latter's visit to the United States, that even if
Taiwan buys the U. S. package, Taiwan cannot protect itself, and can
only show that the island has the determination and sincerity to
safeguard itself.

ANTI-SECESSION LAW NOT A LAW OF PEACE: ROC DIPLOMAT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  March 16 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing's Anti-Secession Law is by no
means a law of peace because it cuts short mainland China's
decision-making process for war, and threatens cross-Taiwan Strait
relations and stability in the region, Republic of China
Representative to the United States David Lee said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lee made the remarks while giving a speech on the law's impact on
the cross-strait situation to a group of Taiwan Congress Caucus
members under the House of Representatives at the Rayburn Office
Building.
</P>
<P>
He said that Beijing's adoption of the law has taken the Taiwan
authorities and its people by surprise and stirred up deep concern
among them at a time of detente evidenced in a series of events that
have helped bilateral ties, such as the historic direct lunar new
year charter flights and a joint statement issued by President Chen
Shui-bian and People First Party Chairman James Soong vowing not to
change the national title of the ROC.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the law is not in any form a law of peace as
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao claimed, he said that by delegating power
to the State Council and the Central Military Committee to decide on
and execute non-peaceful means and other necessary measures, it
enables Beijing to initiate hostilities in circumvention of even
their own existing checks and balances and aggravates its military
threat against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the law defies the key element of the U.S. policy
toward Taiwan -- no unilateral change of the status quo across the
strait and a peaceful resolution of disputes, he said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he added that the law is a direct challenge to the
Taiwan Relations Act, which states that "any effort to determine the
future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means is...a threat to the
peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern
to the United States." Peace and stability in the region are vital to
U.S. interests.
</P>
<P>
According to the ROC de-facto ambassador to the United States,
the law is not only detrimental to cross-strait relations but also
poses great harm to the world order.
</P>
<P>
Citing results of recent polls, Lee pointed out that 93 percent
of the Taiwan people are against the Anti-Secession Law, while 91
percent want to have their own say on the future of Taiwan. More than
80 percent prefer the status quo to Beijing's "one country, two
systems" unification formula, he added.
</P>
<P>
Urging the United States and the international community not to
underestimate its seriousness and to continue to take a firm and
principled position as remedies for the law, he reaffirmed that
Taiwan will stand firm on its commitment to boosting peace, democracy
and prosperity in the region and the rest of the world.

The Republic of China government is

Anti-Secession Law, a Presidential Office spokesman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Wen-tsung, director of the Presidential Office's Public

Representatives passed a resolution by a vote of 424-4 condemning
China's newly enacted law targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"We appreciate the U.S. congressional resolution expressing grave
concern about Beijing's ill-intentioned piece of legislation, " Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China's "anti-secession" legislation codifies the use
of non-peaceful means against Taiwan, Chen said he is convinced that
no government or individuals who value freedom, democracy and peace
could accept such an act or sit idly by.
</P>
<P>
Since Beijing's rubber-stamp National People's Congress passed
its Anti-Secession Law March 14, Chen said many countries around the
world have voiced concern and support for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"The Presidential Office is very grateful for the warmth and
friendship shown by the international community toward us at this
critical moment," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House resolution demands that the Bush administration
voice its grave concern about Beijing's provocative action in
enacting a law authorizing the use of force to stop Taiwan from
seeking formal independence.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also urges the administration to reaffirm the U.S.
policy that the future of Taiwan should be resolved by peaceful means
and with the consent of the people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was introduced by Chairman of the House
International Relations Committee Henry Hyde and the Committee's
ranking member Tom Lantos along with a handful committee members,
including Chris Smith, Dan Burton, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Dana
Rohrabacher, Steve Chabot, Darrell Issa, Jo Ann Davis, Joe Wilson and
Connie Mack.
</P>
<P>
The resolution concludes that:
(1) The Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China
</P>
<P>
provides a legal justification for the use of force against
</P>
<P>
Taiwan, altering the status quo in the region, and thus is of
</P>
<P>
grave concern to the United States;
(2) The president of the United States should direct all appropriate
</P>
<P>
officials of the United States Government to reflect the grave
</P>
<P>
concern with which the United States views the passage of China's
</P>

Anti-Secession Law in particular, and the growing Chinese

KFC SAYS TAIWAN OUTLETS DO NOT USE SUSPECTED CANCER AGENT SUDAN 1 DYE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 17 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan management of the U.S. fast food
restaurant franchise Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) said Thursday that
all dishes offered in its restaurants around Taiwan are safe and free
from the suspected cancer-causing dye Sudan 1.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan KFC Managing Director Olga Wu told the media that
suppliers of Taiwan KFC and those in China are different and all the
food materials and ingredients provided in Taiwan have been monitored
strictly to ensure their quality and safety.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan KFC contacted the media Thursday after KFC China pulled
two chicken dishes off its menu across the country Wednesday after
discovering they contained Sudan 1 dye, a synthetic industrial
chemical banned from use in food. Sudan 1 dye was found in red pepper
powder used as an ingredient in the KFC restaurants' New Orleans
wings and drumstick burgers.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the ingredients used in the KFC restaurants around
China were locally-sourced, Wu said that the red pepper powder used
in Taiwan's KFC restaurants is imported from Spain.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Wu reiterated, use of dyes like Sudan 1, 2, 3 and 4 are
strictly controlled in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
As of noon Thursday, news reports from mainland China said that
Sudan 1 -- used in petrol and shoe polish but banned from food
because it heightens the risk of cancer -- was distributed by a
Guangzhou-based factory to suppliers in nine provinces across China
for use in foods.
</P>
<P>
Sudan 1 triggered a food scare across much of Europe last month.
In Britain, for example, hundreds of sauces, soups and ready-made
meals have been taken off supermarket shelves since the discovery of
the chemical in food on Feb. 18.

U.S. HOUSE RESOLUTION EXPRESSES GRAVE CONCERN ABOUT NEW BEIJING LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  March  16 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives
passed a resolution by a vote of 424-4 Wednesday expressing the grave
concern of the Congress regarding China's recent enactment of its
Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The resolution demands that the Bush administration voice its
grave concern about Beijing's provocative action in enacting a law
authorizing the use of force against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
It also urges the administration to reaffirm the U.S. policy that
the future of Taiwan should be resolved by peaceful means and with
the consent of the people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was initiated by House International Relations
Committee Chairman Henry Hyde and the Committee's ranking member Tom
Lantos along with a handful committee members, including Chris Smith,
Dan Burton, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Dana Rohrabacher, Steve Chabot,
Darrell Issa, Jo Ann Davis, Joe Wilson and Connie Mack.
</P>
<P>
Noting that President George W. Bush stated Dec. 9, 2003 that it
is the U.S. policy to oppose any unilateral decision, by either China
or Taiwan, to change the status quo across the Taiwan Strait, the
resolution says the passage of the Anti-Secession Law by China's
rubber-stamp National People's Congress March 14, 2005 constitutes an
unilateral change to the cross-strait status quo.
</P>
<P>
Citing a report in 2004 by the Department of Defense on China's
military power, the resolution points out that Beijing had deployed
about 500 short-range ballistic missiles aimed at Taiwan and that the
arms buildup of missiles and other offensive weapons by Beijing in
the areas adjacent to the Taiwan Strait poses threat to the peace and
security of the Western Pacific.
</P>
<P>
The resolution further says that the Taiwan Relations Act,
enacted in 1979, makes it clear that Washington's decision to set up
diplomatic relations with Beijing rested upon the expectation that
the future of Taiwan should be determined by peaceful means with the
consent of the people in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
It is Washington's policy to maintain the capacity of the United
States to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion that
would jeopardize the security or the social or economic system of the
people in Taiwan, the resolution says.
</P>
<P>
The resolution concludes that:
(1) The Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China provides
</P>
<P>
a legal justification for the use of force against Taiwan,
</P>
<P>
altering the status quo in the region, and thus is of grave

Acting Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai
pledged Thursday to continue to encourage filmmakers to shoot their
films in the port city by offering them various incentives.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he hopes to turn Kaohsiung into a city similar to

</P>
<P>
Chen noted that Kaohsiung is the first city in Taiwan to have put
forth a film policy, offering cash prizes to support the domestic
film industry and encourage filmmakers to shoot their films in the
city.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the city government will in the future study the
possibility of expanding the policy to the television industry and
provide more resources, assistance and tax deductions to filmmakers
to develop Kaohsiung into a city of digital imaging.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his gratitude for the city government, Tsai said he
will soon return to Kaohsiung to shoot a new film.

GIO TO LAUNCH PUBLICITY DRIVE AGAINST CHINA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 17 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Government Information Office (GIO)
will launch a publicity drive to counter China's series of campaigns
against Taiwan and to underscore Taiwan's own identity, GIO
Director-General Yao Wen-chih said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the Education and Culture Committee at the
Legislative Yuan, Yao pointed out that Beijing has waged war on
Taiwan using public opinion, legal and psychological forces and its
parliament has just passed the Anti-Secession Law to unilaterally
redefine the status quo in the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Beijing is also attempting to use its "one China" myth to squeeze
the maneuvering space of Taiwan internationally, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yao said that to break the myth and reveal the anti-democratic
nature and hegemonic mentality of Beijing, the GIO has asked the
nation's overseas missions to strike back through such activities as
video conferences, seminars, press conferences, interviews or sending
letters to media organizations, hoping that major world media will
report on news about Taiwan and present the island in a positive
light.
</P>
<P>
He also said that to enhance the international understanding of
Taiwan so that the world lends support to the democratic island, the
GIO is also engaging in a national image program. The publicity drive
will vary in content in different countries, although the purpose
will all be to underscore the identity of the nation and to avoid
being confused with the other side of the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
He cited the examples of the GIO running national image ads at
the Athens Olympics last year under the name of Chinese Taipei or
Taiwan, while ranking government officials use Republic of China
(Taiwan) as the nation's name to avoid confusion with the People's
Republic of China, which is the official name of China.

WANG WILL WITHDRAW KMT CHAIRMANSHIP BID IF LIEN SEEKS RE-ELECTION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 17 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng
said Thursday that should opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan decide to seek re-election, he will withdraw his candidacy for
the party's chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who formally announced his bid the same day for the KMT
leadership at a news conference, made the remarks after his meeting
with Lien.
</P>
<P>
Terming Lien as the most suitable candidate to lead the KMT, Wang
said if Lien is willing to continue to shoulder the future of the
party, he will immediately end his campaign and fully support Lien's
re-election.
</P>
<P>
Even though Wang, who serves concurrently as a KMT vice chairman,
has announced his decision to vie for the party's chairmanship, he
has maintained his attitude of "respecting Lien" while seeking
support from party members.
</P>
<P>
Wang is scheduled to head for the United States April 4 to take
part in a series of volunteer fire fighters activities in his capacity
as chairman of the Republic of China National Volunteer Fire Fighters
Association. He will also meet with U.S. congressmen and take
advantage of the trip to drum up support from overseas KMT members
for his chairmanship bid.
</P>
<P>
Seventy incumbent KMT legislators, 60 former lawmakers as well 15
county and city council speakers or deputy speakers attended Wang's
news conference, showing the immense popularity of the 10-term
legislator from the southern county of Kaohsiung. He was re-elected
legislative speaker of the new legislature in February.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Chiu Yi of the opposition People First Party (PFP)
Legislator Liu Kuan-ping of the Taiwan Solidarity Union, as well as
three lawmakers from the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union -- Yen
Ching-piao, Lin Ping-kun and Chang Li-shan -- also appeared at the
news conference to wish Wang luck.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the press conference, Wang noted that if elected as 
party chairman, he will stick to the official names of the party as 
well as the nation and that the Constitution of the Republic of China
will not be abrogated.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and its two
splinter parties -- the PFP and the New Party -- have to unite and
cooperate in response to the aspirations of the voters.
</P>
<P>
If there is no cooperation among the three parties, there will be
no possibility of winning the 2008 presidential election, Wang said,
adding that "this is the destiny of the trio, and the leaders of the
three parties have to face it honestly."
</P>
<P>
Wang's announcement followed that of Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou,
also a KMT vice chairman, who made public his candidacy for the
party's leadership last month. The election of a new KMT chairman is
set for July 16.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
expressed deep gratitude Thursday to the U.S. House of
Representatives for passing a resolution to voice its grave concern
over Beijing's recent passage of its Anti-Secession Law targeting
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives passed the resolution
introduced by Chairman of the House International Relations Committee
Henry Hyde (R.-Il) by a vote of 424-4 Wednesday, demanding that the
Bush administration voice its grave concern about China's provocative
action in enacting a law codifying the use of non-peaceful means

</P>
<P>
The resolution also urges the administration to reaffirm the U.S.
policy that the future of Taiwan should be resolved by peaceful means

<P>
Taiwan, altering the status quo in the region and thus being of

<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said the
government will make every effort to safeguard judicial independence
and the rule of law, and that no one should doubt the judiciary's
impartiality.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks in an article posted on his
personal Web site Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The article came at a time when the supporters of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) are planning to hold a rally Saturday to mark the
presidential election-eve shooting of President Chen on March 19,
2004.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the People First Party
said the shooting was set up to win sympathy votes for President Chen
in his re-election bid. Chen won by a little more than 25,000 votes
out of more than 13 million ballots cast. The "pan-blue alliance"
filed two lawsuits against the election and the result of the
election, but both suits were rejected.
</P>
<P>
The president said that he has fought all his life for the ideal
of "everyone is equal before the law, " and that to carry out the
ideal, the government will safeguard the "independent judicial system"
and the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that no one should ever think that a judicial verdict
was made in Taiwan out of self interest; otherwise,
social order will break down, and "justice and righteousness
will fall," adding that only through a respect of the judicial
system can the democracy in Taiwan mature.

BE WARY OF INFLUX OF FARM PRODUCE FROM CHINA: PINGTUNG OFFICIALS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  17 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the wake of China's offer to allow
imports of Taiwan agricultural produce, officials of the Pingtung
county government have warned of an influx of Chinese farm products
and subsequent complications they might cause.
</P>
<P>
Huang Chen-lung, head of the Agriculture Bureau, suggested that
the central government should weigh the issue comprehensively by
asking what its policy will be should China demand that Taiwan also
open its market to Chinese produce.
</P>
<P>
Huang said Chinese agricultural goods might outperform domestic
produce in the domestic market thanks to their cheaper prices, but he
warned of the risk of disease from Chinese products due to lax
quarantine.
</P>
<P>
Tsao Chi-hung, formerly a legislator from the southern Taiwan
county, pointed out that China will only allow certain kinds of
Taiwan fruit to enter its market, such as papayas, star fruit, bell
fruit and guavas, which are difficult to cultivate in China.
</P>
<P>
According to Tsao, many Chinese agricultural products have
already entered the domestic market, dealing a heavy blow to local
produce.
</P>
<P>
If China demands that Taiwan import agricultural products under
the framework of the World Trade Organization, it will do great harm
to domestic agriculture, Tsao warned, urging the central government
to be cautious when mulling the issue, especially at a time when many
Taiwan fruit growers have relocated to China and are reshipping their
produce back to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
For instance, many mango growers from Taiwan have successfully
planted the tropical fruit in China, and Taiwan's Council of
Agriculture has come under pressure to accept shipments of mangoes
from these farmers, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Huang Juei-chi, an official at the Pingtung County Farmers
Association who visited China last year to negotiate agricultural
exports, said that the officials they met promised to grant market
access to 12 kinds of Taiwan agricultural goods at low customs
tariffs and with easy customs procedures.
</P>
<P>
According to Huang, they expressed their hope that the Chinese
authorities will live up to their promise not to demand that Taiwan
open its market to Chinese products in return.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said March 14 following Beijing's
adoption of the Anti-Secession Law that China is willing to allow
more agricultural products to enter its market, especially those from
southern Taiwan, in a gesture to play down the law's threat against
Taiwan.

ROC VP ADDRESSES SALVADORAN PARLIAMENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
San Salvador,  March  16 (CNA)
(By Yang Chia-hui and Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Visiting Republic of China Vice
President Annette Lu said Wednesday thaT the people of Taiwan will
never yield to China's threats or saber-rattling.
</P>
<P>
Lu, who is currently on a three-day official visit to El
Salvador, made the remarks in a speech delivered at the Salvadoran
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 50-plus years, Lu said, China has used all sorts of
coercion and tricks in attempts to compel Taiwan to surrender to its
unification terms.
</P>
<P>
On March 14, Lu said, China's rubber-stamp National People's
Congress even passed almost unanimously its Anti-Secession Law to
codify the use of non-peaceful means against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"Beijing has 710 ballistic missiles pointed at Taiwan. Now its
ceremonial parliament has adopted the so-called Anti-Secession Law to
authorize the use of force to annex Taiwan, " Lu said, adding that
the international community should not sit idly by and should instead
take concrete action to condemn Beijing's ill-intentioned
legislation.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the United Nations will celebrate its 60th
anniversary this year, Lu said the ROC used to be a U.N. founding
member. However, the ROC has been shut out of the world body since
1971, when the United Nations gave the China seat to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Despite China's diplomatic suppression and military threats, Lu
said, the ROC will never give in and will instead make every possible
effort to safeguard its freedom, democracy, national dignity and
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Lu paid a visit to Salvadoran President Elias
Antonio Saca to exchange views on a range of topics of mutual
concern, including Beijing's provocative anti-secession legislation.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Saca reaffirmed his country's staunch support
for Taiwan, saying his administration's support for Taiwan's cause
will never waver.
</P>
<P>
Lu presented pictures featuring the Salvadoran capital of San
Salvador taken by the ROC satellite Formosa II.
</P>
<P>
During their hour-long talk, Saca and Lu also discussed a
proposed bilateral cooperative project to build a special industrial
park in El Salvador to attract investment from Taiwan businesses as
well as Salvadoran entrepreneurs in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The project will mark the first time the ROC government has
joined forces with the private sector to set up an industrial park in
El Salvador.
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon, Lu met with Salvadoran Vice President Ana Vilma
De Escobar. On behalf of the government, Lu decorated Escobar with a
medal in recognition of her contributions to the promotion of
bilateral relations. In return, Escobar conferred upon Lu a medal on
behalf of the Salvadoran government.
</P>
<P>
Escobar denounced Beijing's Anti-Secession Law, saying that any
dispute should be resolved by peaceful means and that the use of
force should never be legalized. In addition to offering diplomatic
support for the ROC, Escobar said El Salvador will urge other Central
American countries to lend support to Taiwan's cause.
</P>
<P>
Later, they held a joint news conference to brief the press on
key points regarding the proposed "Taiwan Park" project.
</P>
<P>
In response to press inquiries about Taiwan's aid for its
diplomatic allies and the issue of alleged political contributions,
Lu said the ROC has consistently conducted comprehensive feasibility
studies before finalizing specific aid projects.
</P>
<P>
Lu said recipients of aid should formulate effective supervisory
mechanisms to oversee the implementation of aid projects and the use
of the funds. The ROC can do little to supervise the flow of funds
after their appropriation to the recipient country, she explained.
</P>
<P>
Lu arrived in San Salvador Monday at the head of a 152-member
delegation for a visit aimed at cementing bilateral diplomatic ties
and boosting trade and economic cooperation. She will also visit
Guatemala before ending her two-leg diplomatic tour.

PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR MARCH 26 RALLY VITAL FOR DEMOCRACY: PRESIDENT

<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian called on the
public Thursday to take part in a March 26 rally to protest China's
Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan, saying that their passion and
support for the demonstration will be a pivotal cornerstone for the
nation's democracy, freedom and progress.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while receiving a group of representatives
from the Taiwan Junior Chamber at the Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
Over 200 civic groups have so far expressed support for the
nationwide rally against Beijing's Anti-Secession Law, which provides
the Chinese authorities with a legal basis for using non-peaceful
means against Taiwan if the island moves toward independence, Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
Chen expressed his heartfelt thanks to four international
organizations -- the Taiwan Junior Chamber, the Taiwan District of
Kiwanis International, the Taiwan Chapter of Lions Clubs
International and Rotary International Taiwan -- for joining hands
with the ruling Democratic Progress Party to initiate the rally.
</P>
<P>
The president said he hopes that people from all walks of life
will enthusiastically participate in the demonstration to show their
solid support and strong desire for freedom, democracy and peace.

TAITRA PLANS TO SET UP 10 MORE OVERSEAS POSTS THIS YEAR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  17 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Taiwan External Trade Development
Council (TAITRA) , a non-profit trade promotion entity, plans to
establish 10 more overseas posts this year, TAITRA Secretary-General
Chao Yung-chuan said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chao did not reveal exactly where the 10 projected overseas posts
will be established, saying only that they will be in Asia, Eastern
Europe and the Americas.
</P>
<P>
The new offices will bear the name "Taiwan Trade Office" if
possible, he added.
</P>
<P>
Given that many of TAITRA's overseas posts were established
during the era of the China External Trade Development Council
(CETRA) before it was renamed TAITRA, Taiwan's largest trade promoter
has been conducting a drive since 1999 to change all the names into
"Taiwan Trade Center" with the aim of avoiding confusion with Chinese
organizations, Chao explained.
</P>
<P>
The name-changing movement has been going smoothly thus far, with
all 35 TAITRA overseas offices re-designated as "Taiwan Trade Center"
except those in Moscow, Mexico, Hong Kong and India, he added.

U.S. HOUSE RESOLUTION FAVORABLY RECEIVED BY TAIWAN POLITICAL PARTIES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 17 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All parties across Taiwan's political
spectrum expressed welcome Thursday to a U.S. House of
Representatives resolution denouncing Beijing's recent passage of the
Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives passed the resolution by an
overwhelming vote of 424-4 Wednesday, demanding that the Bush
administration voice its grave concern about China's provocative
action in enacting a law codifying the use of non-peaceful means
against Taiwan should Taiwan seek formal independence.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also urges the U.S. administration to reaffirm the
U.S. policy that the future of Taiwan should be resolved by peaceful
means and with the consent of the people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the passage of the resolution, Chen Chin-chun, a
legislative whip of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) ,
said the U.S. lawmakers voiced their strong support for Taiwan by
almost unanimously passing the resolution.
</P>
<P>
However, by comparison, Chen claimed, Taiwan's lawmakers lack any
esprit de corps in the wake of China's enactment of the
ill-intentioned legislation, consequently resulting in a failure to
pass a similar resolution introduced by the opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) , an ally party of the DPP with just 12 seats
in the 225-seat legislature, several days ago.
</P>
<P>
Chen called for the opposition Kuomintang and People First Party
to demonstrate unity and consolidation by explicitly voicing Taiwan's
opposition to the law and by jointly passing the TSU-introduced
resolution entitled "unite Taiwan, resist invasion and uphold
freedom."
</P>
<P>
Chen also urged the people of Taiwan to come out March 26 in a
nationwide rally aimed at saying "no" to China.
</P>
<P>
Expressing welcome to the U.S. House of Representatives' passage
of the resolution Wednesday, TSU party whip Lo Chih-ming said that
people's standards of seeking freedom, democracy and human rights are
identical in the United States and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lo claimed that the Anti-Secession Law passed by the Chinese
rubber stamp National People's Congress March 14 violates the Taiwan
Relations Act, a U.S. law that stipulates that no non-peaceful means
should be used to undermine peace across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
The Anti-Secession Law has also stepped on the U.S. "red light
zone" regarding cross-strait relations, Lo added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chen Chieh, a legislative whip of the opposition
Kuomintang, offered his appreciation for the U.S. House of
Representatives for its support for Taiwan and for its opposition to
China's military threats against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the cross-strait issue is a thorny one, Chen Chieh
called for the leaders on both sides of the strait to use wisdom and
patience in jointly resolving cross-strait differences in a peaceful
manner.
</P>
<P>
As important trade partners, the two sides should further enhance
exchanges and allow political differences to be resolved through
peaceful negotiations and consultations, Chen Chieh added.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chih-ping, a PFP legislative whip, attributed the
U.S. House of Representatives resolution to the success of Taiwan's
expressions of indignation at China.
</P>
<P>
The outcry of the Taiwan people over the Anti-Secession Law has
gained support and sympathy from the international community, Chen
Chih-ping said, adding that the government should continue to expand
Taiwan's diplomatic front to secure broader global support.

MOFA WORKS TO PUT ANTI-SECESSION LAW DISPUTE TO U.N. DEBATE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 17 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen
said Thursday that the his ministry is working on strategies aimed at
putting China's controversial Anti-Secession Law up for debate at the
United Nations through Taiwan's diplomatic allies.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that Beijing has called on allied pro-China countries
to push for a publicity drive on its enactment of the Anti-Secession
Law, a piece of legislation which he said has triggered a "tidal
wave" of opposition and concern worldwide.
</P>
<P>
To counter Beijing's lobbying efforts, Chen said, the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs has worked out several strategies of its own,
including sending Taiwan publicity groups to important and
influential countries to make Taiwan's stance more clearly known,
distributing President Chen Shui-bian's position papers through
Taiwan's diplomatic missions overseas and enabling the cross-Taiwan
Strait disputes derived from the enactment of the law to reach the
U.N. Assembly for debate through Taiwan's diplomatic allies.
</P>
<P>
On allegations that Beijing will probably make some concessions
on the diplomatic front as a form of compensation to Taiwan after
passing the ill-intentioned law targeting Taiwan, Chen described this
as wishful thinking.
</P>
<P>
He added that if China is sincere in wanting to mend fences with
Taiwan, it should help Taiwan improve its living space in the
international community instead of tossing Taiwan some "tiny favors."

U.S. URGED TO PRESSURE BEIJING OVER ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 17 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government is hopeful that the United
States will continue to put pressure upon China over its newly
enacted Anti-Secession Law aimed at Taiwan, Executive Yuan Spokesman
Cho Jung-tai said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Cho made the remarks after the U.S. House of Representatives
passed a resolution to voice its great concern over the passage of
the Anti-Secession Law by China's National People's Congress Monday,
as it provides the legal basis for the use of non-peaceful means
against Taiwan if the nation moves toward formal independence.
</P>
<P>
According to Cho, the U.S. House of Representatives stresses in
its resolution that the future of Taiwan should be decided by the 23
million people of Taiwan.

</P>
<P>
Noting that this is a very important concept, Cho voiced the hope
that the U.S. government will continuously express its grave concern
over the Anti-Secession Law and press for the Beijing authorities to
resolve all disputes triggered by the law.
</P>
<P>
As for an upcoming visit to China by U.S. Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice, Cho said she is expected to bring the international
community's concern over the issue to the Beijing leadership and that
the government will keep a close eye on related developments.
</P>
<P>
As for the question of whether China will show goodwill toward
Taiwan's presence in the international arena following the enactment
of the Anti-Secession Law, Cho said that Taiwan will seek to
participate in international organization on its own and will never
soften its solid stance due to any "insignificant favor" from China.

<P>
Taiwan's exports to China amounted to
US$61.6 billion for the whole of 2004, up 33.1 percent from the
previous year's level, according to government statistics released
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of Taiwan's dependence on China in terms of exports
climbed to an all-time high of 25.8 percent in 2004, up 1.3
percentage points from the 24.5 percent of 2003, an official of the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics under the
Executive Yuan said.
</P>
<P>
If shipments to Hong Kong are excluded, exports to China hit
US$45 billion last year, posting an annual growth rate of 27.2
percent, the official said, adding that machinery and related spare
parts ranked first in terms of export value (US$14 billion), followed
by optical instruments and spare parts (US$5.7 billion) and machine
tools and spare parts (US$5.6 billion).
</P>

CHINA'S ENACTMENT OF ANTI-SECESSION LAW MAY BENEFIT TAIWAN: MINISTER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   March  17  (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China's recent enactment of the
Anti-Secession Law will benefit Taiwan if the nation handles
repercussions of the legislation prudently, Minister of Foreign
Affairs Tan Sun Chen said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The United States House of Representatives approved a resolution
by an overwhelming vote of 424-4 Wednesday urging President George
Bush's administration to voice grave concern about China's
provocative action in enacting the law, in which Beijing gives itself
the authority to use "non-peaceful means" against Taiwan, Chen noted.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate is expected to pass a similar resolution in a few
days, he added.
</P>
<P>
Washington may reconsider a proposal by Taiwan to amend the
Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) to enhance Taiwan's security in the wake
of China's legislation, the minister went on.
</P>
<P>
The TRA has been in effect for more than 25 years and the U.S.
rejected a similar proposal several years ago in light of the fact
that it is a U.S. internal law and that China's reaction might have
made the situation more complicated, Chen pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Japan, which listed the Taiwan Strait issue as one
of their common strategic objectives in a joint statement issued
after concluding their Security Consultative Committee meeting Feb.
19 in Washington, might further realize the importance of protecting
the area's security after China's ill-intended legislation, he
continued.
</P>
<P>
Also, he said, the European Union, which is mulling the lifting
of an arms embargo on China by the end of June, might reconsider its
intent in the face of increasing pressure from the United States and
the international community following Beijing's enactment of the
controversial law.

DPP CAUCUS CALLS FOR OPPOSITION PARTIES TO HELP SHOW TAIWAN'S UNITY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  18 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) urged its opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) and People First Party (FPF) counterparts Friday to jointly
denounce Beijing's enactment of the so-called "anti-secession law"
targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lai Ching-teh, a DPP legislative whip, said that members of the
U.S. House of Representatives voiced their strong support for Taiwan
by passing a resolution almost unanimously Wednesday that urges the
Bush administration to voice grave concern about China's provocative
action in enacting the law, in which Beijing gives itself the
authority to use "non-peaceful means" against Taiwan should the
island move toward independence.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also urges the U.S. administration to reaffirm the
U.S. policy that the future of Taiwan should be resolved by peaceful
means and with the consent of the people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate is expected to pass a similar resolution in a few
days, according to Foreign Affairs Minister Tan Sun Chen.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Lai claimed, Taiwan's lawmakers have lacked unity in
the wake of China's enactment of the "ill-intentioned" legislation,
resulting in a failure to pass a similar resolution introduced
several days ago by the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), an
ally party of the DPP.
</P>
<P>
Lai said that inter-party efforts to oppose the anti-secession
legislation, through which he claims Beijing aims to unilaterally
determine Taiwan's future, have so far been non-existent because the
KMT and the PFP have closed the door to any negotiations after their
attempts to resume the "truth investigation mechanism" on the March
19, 2004 presidential election eve shooting failed.
</P>
<P>
Lai called for the KMT and PFP to demonstrate Taiwan's unity and
consolidation by joining the DPP in explicitly voicing the country's
opposition to the Beijing law and passing a resolution of Taiwan's
own.

ARMED FORCES POLICE COMMAND DENIES PRESENCE OF WIRETAPPING CENTER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 18 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Armed Forces Police Command (AFPC) has
categorically denied the presence of any wiretapping center in the
basement of its headquarters in Taipei as reported by the local news
media.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said that in addition to the wiretapping center at
the Military Intelligence Bureau under the Ministry of National
Defense, military intelligence authorities have another electronic
eavesdropping stronghold which has never been exposed before.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, the maximum-guarded wiretapping center
is located in the basement of the AFPC's Taipei headquarters.
</P>
<P>
"The reports are not true, " the AFPC said in a press statement,
adding that the command has never installed a so-called wiretapping
center in its history.
</P>
<P>
The statement said a group of lawmakers from the Legislative
Yuan's Defense Committee made an inspection tour of the AFPC last
year to check whether the command had a wiretapping center and found
that it did not, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The AFPC 's statement came a day after ruling Democratic
Progressive Party Legislator Huang Chien-hui complained about what he
called local prosecutors' abuse of their power to authorize wiretaps
at a meeting of the legislature's Judicial Committee.
</P>
<P>
Quoting official tallies, Huang said local prosecution
authorities approved more than 19,000 wiretap applications in 2004,
almost two times the number authorized in the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Is this reasonable? " Huang asked. "The United States has a
population of more than 200 million, while Taiwan has only 23 million
people. It seems to me that the number of our authorized wiretaps has
gone out of proportion to our population and indicates that our
prosecution authorities do not respect local people's privacy and
human rights," Huang claimed.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Minister of Justice Shih Mao-lin
and State Public Prosecutor General Wu Ying-chao said they share
Huang's view that the number of authorized wiretaps is "too high."
</P>
<P>
Both Shih and Wu promised to demand that prosecutors tighten
screening of wiretap requests in the future. They also promised to
study the feasibility of delegating the power of wiretap
authorization to judges. Prosecutors currently have the power to
authorize wiretaps.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics compiled by the State Public Prosecutor
General's Office, a total of 19,485 wiretap applications were
approved in 2004, marking a whopping increase from about 3,000
recorded in 2000.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 percent of the authorized wiretaps were related to
drug trafficking and firearm trading investigations, and less than 10
percent were related to corruption probes, Wu said, adding that the
wiretapping periods for some cases lasted more than a year.

TAIWAN KFC FOOD CONTAINS NO CANCER-CAUSING SUDAN 1 DYE: DOH
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  May 18 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Department of Health (DOH) announced
Friday that no suspected cancer-causing dye Sudan 1 has been found in
ingredients used in Taiwan's Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC)
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
According to Hsiao Tong-ming, deputy director of the DOH's Bureau
of Food Sanitation, Taiwan management of the U.S. fast food
restaurant franchise KFC submitted their documents to the food
sanitation bureau for examination Thursday proving that the
ingredients used in its restaurants islandwide are safe and free from
Sudan 1 dye.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Food Sanitation carried out a surprise inspection
of a KFC ingredient preparation factory located on Roosevelt Road,
Taipei City, Thursday night and discovered that the company's
ingredients, especially red pepper powder, contained no synthetic dye
Sudan 1, which has triggered a food scare over the past several days
in mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Sudan 1, a synthetic chemical used in petrol and shoe polish but
banned from use in food products because it is suspected of
increasing the risk of cancer, was found to have been used in two KFC
dishes in China. The chemical was illegally used in food because it
is light-resistant and helps retain red pepper powder's fresh color,
said Hsiao.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan KFC Managing Director Olga Wu told media that suppliers of
Taiwan KFC and those in China are different and all the food
materials and ingredients provided in Taiwan have been monitored
strictly to ensure their quality and safety.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan KFC contacted the media Thursday after KFC China pulled
two chicken dishes off its menu across the country Wednesday after
discovering that they contained Sudan 1 dye. Sudan 1 dye was found in
red pepper powder used as an ingredient in the KFC restaurants' New
Orleans wings and drumstick burgers.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the ingredients used in the KFC restaurants around
China are locally-sourced, Wu said that the red pepper powder used in
Taiwan's KFC restaurants is imported from Spain.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Wu reiterated, use of dyes like Sudan 1, 2, 3 and 4 are
strictly controlled in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
News reports from mainland China Thursday said that a
Guangzhou-based factory was supplying Sudan 1 to distributors in nine
provinces across China for use in food products.
</P>
<P>
Sudan 1 triggered a food scare across much of Europe last month.
In Britain, for example, hundreds of sauces, soups and ready-made
meals have been taken off supermarket shelves since the discovery of
the chemical in food products on Feb. 18.

<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Friday that he
will conform to the Republic of China Constitution and will not
change the nation's official designation during his term before the
Constitution has been amended.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the remarks while answering questions from opposition
People First Party lawmakers Cheng Chin-ling and Chung Shao-ho during
an interpellation session at the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The premier pledged not to alter the nation's official title or
push for a new constitution while serving in the post, but he pointed
out that the "one China" framework presented in the current
Constitution could be amended as long as a national consensus is
forged and reactions from the international community and Beijing are
weighed across the board.
</P>
<P>
At a time when Beijing has passed its Anti-Secession Law aimed at
Taiwan, the people in Taiwan, regardless of their political
affiliations, should unite to counter Beijing's threats and strongly
voice their objections to the international community, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh also said that the government will exercise extreme caution
when handling cross-Taiwan Strait relations based on the strong
public desire for peace and democracy, which he said are universally
recognized values and the largest common ground shared by the people
in Taiwan.

Lecturers and students from National
Taiwan University continued a sit-in Friday to vehemently express
their opposition to Beijing's enactment of the Anti-Secession Law
targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The sit-in began March 15 at noon, one day after China's rubber

KMT ESTIMATES 100,000 WILL TAKE PART IN 319 MARCH
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 18 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) estimated
Friday that 100,000 people will take part in a march Saturday to mark
the first anniversary of the March 19 presidential election-eve
shooting of President Chen Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
KMT Chairman Lien Chan and New Party Chairman Yok Mu-ming, as
well as two KMT vice chairmen -- Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang
Jin-pyng and Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou -- will take part in the
march, which will start at 1: 30 p.m. at the Sungshan Tobacco Factory
and end on Ketagalan Boulevard in front of the Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
The activity at Ketagalan Boulevard will start at 3:20 p.m.
Wang, Ma as well as lawyer Wang Ching-feng will deliver speeches.
Lien will give the last speech and participants will sing "Tomorrow
will be a Better Day" before ending the activity at 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
KMT spokeswoman Cheng Li-wen estimated that 100,000 will take
part in the rally. The KMT will mobilize supporters living north of
Miaoli, estimated at 50,000, while the rest will come voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chieh, KMT caucus whip in the legislature, said that to
pursue "truth" for the sake of Taiwan democracy, he believes many KMT
members will take part in the march voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that the march was launched by "Democratic Action
Alliance, " a group comprised of academic, social movement and
cultural figures, and that the KMT identifies with its ideals.
</P>
<P>
Chen also said that the truth of the shooting is still
unanswered, and claimed that this has caused a lot of damage to
Taiwan's democracy.
</P>
<P>
James Soong, chairman of the opposition People First Party (PFP),
will not take part in the rally.
</P>
<P>
PFP Legislator Chou Hsi-wei said that the PFP members can decide
for themselves whether they want to take part, but he predicted that
many party members will want to attend.
</P>
<P>
Lien and Soong, who represented the "pan-blue alliance" of the
KMT and the PFP in the 2004 presidential election, claimed that the
shooting, which slightly injured the president, was staged to win
sympathy votes for Chen's second bid for the presidency.
Chen won by a little more than 25,000 votes out of more than 13
million cast in the election. Lien and Soong filed two lawsuits
against the election and the result of the election, both of
which were later rejected by the courts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Taiwan Solidarity Union said Friday that the
contention revolving around the shooting is a judicial issue and
should not be the subject of protest marches.
</P>
<P>
The TSU urged the KMT to exercise self-restraint and act
rationally or face its responsibility in history.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Lo Chih-ming, TSU caucus whip in the legislature, also
said that Ma is the highest official in charge of the social order of
the capital city and should not take part in Saturday's march so as
to avoid being "a player and a referee at the same time."

Opposition legislators and a civic group
staged a skit in downtown Taipei as a warmup to a protest rally to
mark Saturday's first anniversary of the March 19 presidential
election-eve shooting of President Chen Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Li-wen, spokeswoman of the opposition Kuomintang, KMT
Legislator Hung Hsiu-chu, People First Party (PFP) Legislator Sun
Ta-chien and five other people donned white costumes to display the
words "there would be peace if there weren't bullets" in a skit
performed in front of the Taipei Guest House.
</P>
<P>
Chang Ya-chung, founder of the 319 Action Committee, claimed that
the two bullets fired March 19 last year "smashed values and
democracy in Taiwan" and that the public's hopes for the truth had
been illegally squeezed and unreasonably suffocated. The 319
Action Committee was formed by the Democratic Action Alliance, a
group of academic, social movement and literary figures.
</P>
<P>
The public can only use the simplest method of taking their
protest to the streets, using their shouts to express their demand
that the president provide truth so as to free them from being
"duped" and so that Taiwan will have "genuine justice and democracy,"
Chang said.
</P>
<P>
The opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the PFP claimed
that the shooting, which slightly injured President Chen and Vice
President Annette Lu, was staged to win sympathy votes for Chen's
second bid for the presidency. Chen won by a razor-thin margin
against his rival KMT Chairman Lien Chan. The KMT and the PFP filed
two lawsuits against the election and the result of the election,
both of which were later rejected by the courts.

Even though Taiwan is an island country, few people here know
much about the culture of the ocean or have the disposition of
magnanimity and toleration that the ocean demonstrates, according to
Taibang Lesale.
</P>
<P>
For the April yachting voyage, the 10 participants will embark
from the southern port city of Kaohsiung to Batan Island, the
northernmost island in the Philippines, to experience an ocean voyage
that was taken by the ancestors of Taiwan's aboriginal people
hundreds or thousands years ago, Taibang Lesale said.
</P>
<P>
He added that people in the Batan island group speak almost
exactly the same language as that spoken by the aboriginal people of
Tao on Taiwan's Orchid Island. The two peoples also look very alike,
share the same dietary habits and live in the same kind of dwellings.
</P>
<P>
The Kaohsiung city government organized a cultural exchange
between Orchid Island and Batan in 1998, kicking off exchanges
between peoples from the two sides. In 2002, Taiwan and the
Philippines signed an agreement to further bolster agricultural,
fishing, cultural and leisure exchanges and cooperation between the
two countries, Taibang Lesale said.

MEMBERSHIP FEES BECOME ISSUE IN KMT CHAIRMAN ELECTION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 18 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng
said Friday that whether members of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
who have not paid their membership fees will be allowed to take part
in the KMT chairman election will be decided by a KMT Central
Standing Committee meeting next week.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who announced his bid to run for the party's top post the
previous day, made the remarks as the seemingly trivial issue popped
up with he and Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou joining the race, since both
are considered to be of equal weight politically.
</P>
<P>
It is generally believed that Wang favors allowing non-paid up
members to take part in the vote.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that whether to allow such members to take part in the
party chairman election will be decided in a vote by the KMT Central
Standing Committee members if coordination on the matter fail to
achieve a result.
</P>
<P>
Asked about reports citing Wang as saying that even if Ma fails
in the KMT chairman election, Ma will still be a potential
presidential candidate in 2008, Wang said only that if he is elected
KMT chairman, the opposition "pan-blue alliance" will nominate the
presidential and vice presidential candidates with the best chance of
winning.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ma said that the membership fee issue should be viewed
from the angle of the party system.

</P>
<P>
Ma said that while the KMT claims it has 1.09 million members,
"everyone knows" that the figure is a far cry from the actual figure.
</P>
<P>
He said that the party should first do a census to check the
exact number and ascertain how many have paid membership fees. It can
then assess the membership fee system and the advantages and
disadvantages of whether to keep the system before making a "more
comprehensive" decision.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the KMT's Organization and Development Committee is
now doing a census of the party members, which is expected to be
completed by the end of April.

ALL PARTIES WELCOME AT 326 RALLY AGAINST ANTI-SECESSION LAW: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 18 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Friday that the
March 26 rally organized by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) against China's Anti-Secession Law will be a non-partisan
event.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said during a legislative interpellation session that
members of all political parties are welcome to join the rally and
that participants are free to bring along national flags or their
party flags.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said the government will encourage people to take part in
the rally, even though it is not organizing the event, and that he
will announce Sunday or Monday whether he himself will participate.
</P>
<P>
He said the Anti-Secession Law infringes on the right of the
Taiwan people to choose their future and that the rally will stick to
the theme of peace and democracy to fight for the best interests of
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, DPP spokesman Cheng Wen-tsan said members of a DPP-led
"democracy and peace" alliance supporting the rally will visit the
opposition Kuomintang, People First Party and Non-Partisan Solidarity
Union, as well as Legislative Yuan speaker Wang Jin-pyng and Taipei
Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, to invite them to take part.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said the alliance is opposed to China's use of non-peaceful
means to threaten Taiwan's democracy and cross-Taiwan Strait peace.
</P>
<P>
While protecting Taiwan is a consensus between the "pan-blue" and
"pan-green" camps, the DPP welcomes all parties to take part in the
rally, Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
Cheng called on opposition leaders to put aside political
differences and join the DPP in participating in the rally to exhibit
the public opinion of Taiwan and jointly protect the island.
</P>
<P>
Also Friday, DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang attended an event held
by several Hakka women's groups to promote the rally, which hopes to
attract 1 million participants.
</P>
<P>
According to Su, a large number of people from around the island
have signed up for the rally over the past week and the alliance is
currently tallying the number of participants.

ROC-GUATEMALA TIES REMAIN STEADFAST: VP LU
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Guatemala City, March 16 (CNA)
(By Yang Chia-hui and Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China's attempts to lure Guatemala
to switch diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing has failed as
relations between the Republic of China and Guatemala have remained
steadfast, visiting ROC Vice President Annette Lu said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lu, heading a 152-member delegation of government officials and
senior business executives, arrived in the Guatemalan capital of
Guatemala City in the morning on the second leg of her current
Central America diplomatic tour that already took her to El Salvador.
</P>
<P>
As Lu came on the heels of the departure of a large Chinese trade
mission, many journalists asked Lu whether Taiwan's diplomatic
relations with Guatemala would be affected by China's lobby with
lucrative trade and investment deals.
</P>
<P>
Despite China's strenuous lobby campaign, Lu said ROC-Guatemalan
relations have remained unchanged and steadfast. Lu said Guatemalan
President Oscar Berger Perdomo is scheduled to visit Taiwan in August
to attend the inaugural ceremony of the Democratic Pacific Union.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to show his staunch support for Taiwan, Lu said,
Berger has ordered a Guatemalan commercial and industrial delegation
to cancel its planned market inspection visit to China. The group was
originally scheduled to visit the mainland next month, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
As to reports that Guatemala is unhappy with Taiwan's plan to
build a special industrial park in El Salvador to attract investment
from Taiwan and ethnic Salvadoran entrepreneurs in the United States,
Lu said each country has its own unique business environment.
</P>
<P>
To the best of her understanding, Lu said the Guatemalan
government has not been dissatisfied with the "Taiwan park" project
in El Salvador.
</P>
<P>
"With opportunities presenting themselves, El Salvador took the
lead in coming up with the 'Taiwan park' project. The ROC government
doesn't rule out the possibility of launching similar projects in
other countries, including Guatemala, " Lu said, adding that one
purpose of her current visit is to explore Guatemala's investment
environment.
</P>
<P>
Since the Democratic Progressive Party administration took power
in Taiwan, Lu said, it has consistently attached great importance on
cementing relations with the ROC's diplomatic allies. In the future,
Lu said the government will continue making every possible effort to
boost trade and economic cooperation with Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
Lu received a red-carpet welcome complete with full military
honor upon her arrival at the Guatemala City airport. Guatemalan Vice
President Eduardo Stein and many other senior officials as well as
ROC Ambassador Ou Hong-lien greeted Lu and her entourage at the
airport.
</P>
<P>
Shortly afterwards, Lu paid a visit to the Guatemalan parliament
where she was granted the highest-level courteous treatment. Jorge
Mendez Herbruger, speaker of the Guatemalan parliament, decorated Lu
with a medal in recognition of her contribution to boosting bilateral
ties.
</P>
<P>
Lu then delivered a speech to Guatemalan lawmakers, urging them
to pass a resolution to protest China's enactment of its so-called
anti-secession law targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"I admire your country's courage in aligning with the ROC based
on its conviction of peace, humanity and justice. We are grateful
that Guatemala has not been daunted by China's threat and has
consistently support Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations and
other major international organizations," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Beijing's anti-secession law legalizes the use of
"non-peaceful means" against Taiwan, Lu said the international
community should condemn such a provocative act.
</P>
<P>
"As Taiwan is facing mounting threat from China, we need your
support. I hope the Guatemalan parliament can take a concrete action
to support our cause by passing a resolution condemning China's
ill-intentioned legislation," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
In the evening, Lu hosted a dinner in honor of her counterparts
from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
Lu is scheduled to hold an informal leadership meeting with
Salvadoran Vice President Ana Vilma de Escobar, Guatemalan Vice
President Eduardo Stein, Honduran Vice President Armida de Lopez and
Nicaraguan Vice President Jose Rizo Friday.
</P>
<P>
The informal summit meeting will take place at the sidelines of a
regional meeting of the Democratic Pacific Union (DPU) in America.
Representatives from six Central American allies and five non-allied
countries in North, Central and South America will attend the
meeting, which will be a warm-up to a DPU regional organization to be
established in Taipei Aug. 14.

TAIWAN, ROC TOP CHOICES FOR U.N. NAME
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan and the Republic of China are "top
priority choices" for the name under which Taiwan should bid for its
re-entry into the United Nations, Premier Frank Hsieh said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the remarks during an interpellation session at the
Legislative Yuan when Legislator Huang Hsih-cho of the
pro-independence opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union asked if it is
possible for the government to make its bid under the name of
"Taiwan" after past bids under the name of the "Republic of China"
have failed for 12 consecutive years.

</P>
<P>
The premier said that both "Taiwan" and the "ROC" are top
priority choices, adding that the name does not necessarily have to
conform with the official name. As long as it "benefits the Taiwan
people, " the name of "Taiwan" can be used to join international
organizations, while other names are equally acceptable if
difficulties are encountered.
</P>
<P>
"Active participation in international organizations is the
goal," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Affairs Minister Tan Sun Chen also said it will be very
difficult for the government to promote a return to the U.N.
under the name of the Republic of China and said it is mulling a new
mindset to promote the bid, although the name issue is yet to be
finalized.

ECONOMIST SUGGESTS CONTINUED CROSS-STRAIT EXCHANGES TO THAW TIES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 18 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government should keep a cool head in
gauging the complications of Beijing's Anti-Secession Law and should
continue trade and economic exchanges to thaw ties between Taiwan and
mainland China, a leading domestic economist said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research President Vincent
Siew made the call in an exclusive interview with the Central News
Agency. Siew, a seasoned technocrat, served as premier in the
previous Kuomintang-led government from 1998 to 2000.
</P>
<P>
Siew agreed that the government should lodge a strong protest
against Beijing's Anti-Secession law targeting Taiwan, but advised it
to maintain sound economic and trade exchanges across the Taiwan
Strait.
</P>
<P>
Siew said that cross-strait economic activities might be affected
in the short term by the Anti-Secession Law, but urged the government
to adopt an opening policy to allow for continued interaction between
the two sides to offset the law's impact on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Citing government statistics to buttress his argument that market
forces always prevail over government rules, he said that Taiwan's
trade reliance on the China market has surged to a historic high of
more then 25 percent at present despite various attempts by the
government to stem bilateral exchanges in the past.
</P>
<P>
In view of the situation, he said, the ratio will keep on growing
amid close and frequent two-way exchanges, and he urged the
government to be aware of the fact that policies that go against
market trends are doomed.
</P>
<P>
As the government still needs to resolve various thorny issues,
such as permitting Taiwan hi-tech investment in China and setting up
direct transport links, he proposed that the government follow market
trends as means of improving the fragile cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
Increased economic interaction should be helpful in improving
bilateral relations, he said, admitting that political dialogue
between Taiwan and China is still far off due to a lack of mutual
trust and understanding. Economic dialogue should be a remedy to this
situation, he said.

<P>
Airline companies and travel agencies are
required by law to report China-bound travelers to the immigration
authorities, Mainland Affairs Council Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chiu noted that the requirement is included in the Statute
Governing the Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the
Mainland Area during an amendment in 2003.
</P>
<P>
According to Chiu, keeping China-bound travelers on file is
necessary in light of the continuing outbreaks of infectious diseases
such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, avian flu and
cerebrospinal meningitis in China.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government needs to get an accurate account of
the number of people traveling to China for reference in its

</P>
<P>
Chiu made the remarks in the wake of a local media report that
the Immigration Office under the National Police Agency has recently
asked airline companies and travel agencies to provide the names,
passport numbers and birthdates of China-bound travelers on a daily

</P>
<P>
According to the report, the airline companies and travel

<P>
The European Union has announced the
lifting of an anti-dumping tax on polyester staple fibers from Taiwan
starting March 18, Bureau of Foreign Trade officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The E.U. decided to lift the tax, which was imposed Dec. 16,
1988, after the dumping margin of Taiwanese exporters dropped below 2
percent, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Taiwan exported polyester
staple fiber products worth US$90 million to E.U. nations in 2004,
accounting for 0.38 percent of Taiwan's total exports.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the lifting of the anti-dumping tax will help
enhance the competitiveness of Taiwan's polyester staple fiber
products in the E.U. market.
</P>
<P>
While sparing Taiwan, the E.U. has decided to continue to impose
anti-dumping taxes of between 5.7 percent and 10.6 percent on
polyester staple fibers from South Korea, between 4.9 percent and
49.7 percent on those from China and 20.9 percent on those from Saudi
Arabia, they added.

<P>
Republic of China Vice President
Annette Lu is scheduled to meet her counterparts from four Central
American countries Friday for an informal leadership summit on
Pacific Rim regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Lu, who is currently on a three-day official visit to Guatemala
at the head of a 152-member Taiwan delegation, is scheduled to meet
with El Salvador Vice President Ana Vilma de Escobar, Guatemalan Vice
President Eduardo Stein, Honduran Vice President Armida de Lopez and
Nicaraguan Vice President Jose Rizo at the summit.
</P>
<P>
Guatemalan President Oscar Berger will deliver a keynote speech
at the meeting, according to Lu.
</P>
<P>
The summit will take place on the sidelines of a regional meeting
of the Democratic Pacific Union (DPU) in America in Guatemala.
Representatives from six Central American allies and five non-allied
countries in North, Central and South America will attend the
meeting, which will be a warm-up to the DPU inauguration slated for
Aug. 14 in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the organization's more than 20 founding
member nations, including vice presidents of countries that maintain
diplomatic relations with Taiwan and senior parliamentarians and
lawmakers from countries that are friendly toward Taiwan, are
expected to attend the inaugural ceremony, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Lu and her 152-member entourage arrived in the El Salvador
capital of San Salvador March 14 for an official visit aimed at
cementing diplomatic relations with the Central American ally and
boosting bilateral trade and economic exchanges.
</P>
<P>
During a dinner with Taiwan expatriates there, Lu said she is
hopeful that Taiwan businessmen at home and in El Salvador can join
forces to build an industrial park in El Salvador to accommodate
Taiwan-funded firms, facilitating bilateral trade and economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"The planned park should meet what she called the 'Three P'
goals, namely, the park should be productive, environmentally
protective and have perspective, " Lu said, adding that the park is
expected to begin operation before the end of President Chen
Shui-bian's presidential term in May 2008.
</P>
<P>
During her visit to El Salvador, Lu met with Salvadoran President
Elias Antonio Saca and Vice President De Escobar. She also delivered
aspeech at the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press Thursday, Lu said that the primary goal of
her visit to El Salvador and Guatemala is to pave the way for Taiwan
business and industrial sectors for their global expansion.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan investors can find their investment niches in Central
America not necessarily from high-technology industries, Lu said,
adding that they can help the Latin American countries develop high
value-added textiles and garments using Taiwan's nanotechnology and
they can also help them produce Taiwanese-style foods and delicacies
for export to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Lu has met with Berger and will also deliver a speech at the
Guatemalan parliament before wrapping up her 12-day tour which will
also include a transit stay in Miami.

Angeles and San Francisco in May.
</P>
<P>
Lin, who is a lawmaker for Taiwan's aborigines, said the United
States set May aside as Asian Month in America in 1998.
Many U.S. cities such as Los Angeles and San

promoted the understanding of Asia and Asian communities in America,
and established a strong bond between the Asian and non-Asian
communities.

Taiwan has been allowed to send a team of performers to the
festival since 1998, and was absent from the activities only in 2003
because of the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, Lin

As the United Nations is going to celebrate its 60th anniversary
this year, Lin said, the organizers of the Asian Festival are

will vote this summer on constitutional reforms that Beijing has said
it considers to be part of a timeline for independence.
</P>
<P>
Goss also said that Washington should be concerned that Beijing's
military modernization and buildup pose new questions for the U.S.
and that these improved capabilities could well threaten U.S. forces
in the region.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in 2004, Beijing increased its ballistic missile
forces deployed across from Taiwan and christened several new
submarines. Also, it continues to develop more robust and
harder-to-intercept nuclear-tipped missiles as well as conventional
weaponry for use in a regional conflict.
</P>
<P>
This is tilting the balance of power in the Taiwan Strait, and
threatens U.S. forces in the region, Goss said.
</P>
<P>
Along with this military buildup, Goss went on, Beijing is
increasingly confident and active on the international stage, trying
to ensure that it has a voice on major international issues and
secure access to natural resources. China also hopes to counter what
it sees as U. S. efforts to contain it.
</P>
<P>
However, Goss said, Beijing's new leadership under President Hu
Jintao will face many challenges in 2005, such as the potential for a
resurgence in inflation, increased dependence on exports, growing
economic inequalities, increased awareness of individual rights, and
popular expectations for the new leadership.

USE WTO FRAMEWORK FOR CROSS-STRAIT PRODUCE TRADE: TAINAN MAGISTRATE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 18 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In light of Beijing's proposal to allow
agricultural imports from Taiwan, Tainan County Magistrate Su
Huan-dji suggested Friday that a framework under the World Trade
Organization (WTO) be used to conduct two-way negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Su said that he backs the idea of applying WTO rules to regulate
agricultural exports between the two sides. The magistrate of the
southern Taiwan county also advocated that Taiwan impose strict
quarantine measures on products from China out of serious concerns
over food safety of Chinese goods.
</P>
<P>
Su made the remarks at a news conference after returning to
Taiwan a day earlier from a trip to France, where he sought to seek
Taiwan's sponsorship for a world orchid exhibition slated for 2011.
Singapore won the sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
A recent offer by Beijing to open its markets to Taiwan's
agricultural imports has worried local farmers, predominantly those
in southern counties that rely heavily on agriculture, that the
mainland side may demand that Taiwan open its markets in return.
</P>
<P>
Pingtung County officials warned a few days ago of an influx of
Chinese farm products into the domestic market and called attention
to possible subsequent complications.
</P>
<P>
They urged the central government to study the issue
comprehensively, particularly at a time when many Taiwan farmers and
fruit growers have relocated to China and are shipping their produce
back to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's Council of Agriculture has come under pressure to accept
shipments by those people, they said, pointing out that domestic
goods will be further harmed should more mainland produce be allowed
to enter the Taiwan market.
</P>
<P>
Mainland Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said on March 14 following
Beijing's adoption of the Anti-Secession Law that China is willing to
open its markets to Taiwan's farm produce, in particular those from
southern Taiwan, in an apparent effort to mitigate the law's
perceived damage to cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has repeatedly said that the law was enacted to prevent
Taiwan independence and is not aimed at the people on Taiwan.

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Friday the
government will do its utmost to bolster the cash-strapped national
health insurance program.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the pledge while addressing the opening of an
international seminar on health insurance issues, which was organized
by the Cabinet-level Department of Health to mark the 10th
anniversary of the country's universal health insurance program.
</P>
<P>
Praising the national health insurance program as "Taiwan's
national treasure," Chen said that over the past decade, the program
has benefited local people, particularly those with serious diseases,
chronic ailments or critical injuries.
</P>
<P>
Noting that sustainable development of the health insurance
program is the government's promise to local people, Chen said his
administration will spare no effort to prevent the system from going
bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the Cabinet is working on a package of measures,
including raising the ceiling on the index insurance premium and
increasing taxes on cigarettes and liquors, to improve the program's
financial status.

"With confidence, creativity and strenuous efforts, I'm confident
that we'll succeed in keeping our health insurance program afloat, "
Chen said.

TAIWAN TO BE ASIA'S DESIGN CENTER IN 10 YEARS: DANISH DESIGNER

<P>
Prestigious Danish designer Frederick
Rickmann said Friday that he expects Taiwan will become Asia's design
center by 2015 because of the continued advancement of investments
and education in the field of design.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive and design director of Denmark's forefront
design company, Designnord, made the comment while calling at Johnsee
Lee, president of the Industrial Technology Research Institute
(ITRI).
</P>
<P>
Rickmann is visiting the island at the invitation of the ITRI to
lecture at a three-day ITRI seminar titled "Methods for Innovated
Design with Modern Thoughts," which will begin March 24.
</P>
<P>
The experienced and well-traveled designer said he thinks China's
design capability and product innovation is weak, while Singapore and
Hong Kong are good at trading, not designing.
</P>
<P>
South Korea was seen as having significant improvement in
industrial design, especially in the manufacture of vehicles, mobile
phones and 3C products -- consumer electronics products, computers
and communications, Rickmann said, adding he found that in Taiwan,
more and more money is being spent on investments and education in
design.
</P>
<P>
Lee noted that he feels that non-technical, cultural abilities
will play an increasingly important role in the nation's development.
Because of this, more and more people skilled in the arts and culture
are working at the ITRI now than in the past, he said.

LEE CHIN-YUNG TO TAKE OVER AS ACTING YUNLIN COUNTY CHIEF
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 18 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Friday he has
decided to name Lee Chin-yung, vice chairman of the Public
Construction Commission (PCC), as acting Yunlin County magistrate.
</P>
<P>
"I already informed Lee of his new assignment, " Hsieh told
reporters after attending a Legislative Yuan interpellation session.
</P>
<P>
Lee, a lawyer-turned-politician, once served as mayor of the
northern port city of Keelung. Lee was quoted as having said that he
has keen interest in serving as acting Yunlin county chief because he
is familiar with local government affairs.
</P>
<P>
Before assuming the PCC post in February, Lee had been vice
minister of the interior. He also once served as deputy
secretary-general of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).
</P>
<P>
Lee, a Yunlin County native, is scheduled to assume his new post
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lee will take over as acting Yunlin County magistrate following
the conviction of the incumbent county chief Cahng Jung-wei's
conviction in an election bribery case.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court handed down its ruling for former county chief
Chang Jung-wei earlier this month, sentencing him to 12 months in
jail for his involvement in the 1994 Yunlin County Council
speakership election bribery case.
</P>
<P>
According to current regulations, the Ministry of the Interior
must relieve a local government chief of his or her duties if he or
she is handed a prison sentence that cannot be suspended or commuted
into a fine.
</P>
<P>
As there are less than two years remaining in Chang's term, no
by-election has to be held to elect a successor. Instead, the Cabinet
is authorized by law to name a replacement to serve out the remainder
of the term.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Chang has already been suspended and detained since last
December for his alleged involvement in the corruption scandal. His
deputy is now acting as Yunlin county magistrate. However, the law
requires Chang's deputy, a political appointee, to be relieved of his
duties along with Chang.

PREMIER ASKS KMT TO CALL OFF PROTEST ON ANNIVERSARY OF 319 SHOOTING
</HEADLINE>

(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh urged the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Friday to call off its planned protest on Saturday,
noting that the administration is sympathetic toward their desire to
know all the facts surrounding the assassination attempt of President
Chen Shui-bian on March 19 last year and is working hard to provide
answers.
</P>
<P>
In an apparently futile effort to dissuade the KMT from leading
their supporters to protest what they consider the government's
foot-dragging in investigating the case, the premier told the
Legislative Yuan that law enforcement is doing everything humanly
possible to get to the bottom of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
"It is not necessary to push them to accelerate their
investigation by holding a public protest," Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to preempt the protest, a group of law enforcement
officials investigating the shooting disclosed on March 7 what they
called a major breakthrough in the case, identifying a man who drown
last March 28 as the suspected shooter.
</P>
<P>
The investigators said the man committed suicide after the
shooting and that his body has been cremated.
</P>
<P>
Instead of dissipating critics' suspicions that the shooting was
staged to help President Chen win re-election, the investigators' new
findings have prompted more questions because no hard evidence has
been found to corroborate investigators' claims.
</P>
<P>
At the Legislative Yuan Friday, the premier stopped short of
affirming that the investigators had found the correct suspect,
saying only that he personally believed the deceased man in question
was involved in the shooting, but being aware that questions still
linger, has asked investigators to continue their probe until the
whole truth is uncovered.
</P>
<P>
In order to bring public pressure to bear on the government, the
KMT is calling on its supporters to take to the street in Taipei
Saturday, one year to the day after the shooting.

<TEXT>
<P>
In order to show Taiwan's resentment
toward Beijing's Anti-Secession Law, President Chen Shui-bian urged
Taiwan people to respond to a call by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party and join the protest march in force on March 26.
</P>
<P>
While receiving members of the Executive Committee of the Council
of Asian Liberals and Democrats (CALD), the president said Beijing is
trying to alter the status quo across the Taiwan Strait by enacting
the Anti-Secession Law, which permits it to attack Taiwan under
certain circumstances.
</P>
<P>
"China's attempts to solve the Taiwan issue through non-peaceful
means runs counter to the international trend of solving disputes
through dialogue and would never be accepted by the international
community," the president told his visitors.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan's future should be determined by the great 23 million
people of Taiwan, rather than the 2,000-odd members of China's
National People's Congress, which enacted this Anti-Secession Law, "
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The people on this island will show the world their common
aspirations for democracy and peace, and their collective resentment
towards hegemony and violence in the March 26 protest, the president
said.
</P>
<P>
The CALD Executive Committee will meet Saturday and Sunday in
Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1993, the CALD consists of Asian political parties
that believe in democracy and freedom.
</P>
<P>
The CALD Executive Committee is expected to pass a resolution in
its meeting condemning China for enacting the law.

TAIWAN'S DEMOCRACY SENDS IMPORTANT MESSAGE: U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE

U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice said Friday that Taiwan's democratic development is an important
message indicating that traditional or political culture should not
hamper further political openness in China.
</P>
<P>
"It's yet further evidence that the notion that was in fashion
somehow back in the 1980s and early 90s that democracy was not an
'Asian value' is simply crumbling across the entire region, " Rice
said.
</P>
<P>
"And in this regard, the further development of an open Chinese
political system clearly should not be a matter of traditional or
political culture as people sometimes want to make it," she added.
</P>
<P>
Rice made the remarks during a flight to Tokyo when asked by
reporters what message she will give Beijing about Taiwan. Rice is
scheduled to arrive in Beijing on Sunday as one of her stops on her
on-going Asian tour.
</P>
<P>
Rice said Washington's message to both China and Taiwan is that
the United States maintains a one China policy and does not expect
either side to try to change the cross-Taiwan Strait status quo
unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
She noted that neither China nor Taiwan will be able to resolve
the cross-strait problem unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
"What we've been encouraging instead is that they engage each
other on ways to reduce cross-strait tensions, not engage in
unilateral actions that actually add to cross-strait tensions, " Rice

<TEXT>
<P>
Visiting Republic of China Vice
President met with her counterparts from four Central American
countries Friday during which they expressed their staunch support
for the ROC and urged that cross-Taiwan Strait differences be solved
by peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
Lu, who is currently on a three-day official visit to Guatemala
at the head of a 152-member Taiwan delegation, attended the regional
meeting of the Democratic Pacific Union (DPU) in America, which was
held Friday.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from 11 countries in the region, including
Salvadoran Vice President Ana Vilma de Escobar, Guatemalan Vice
President Eduardo Stein, Honduran Vice President Armida de Lopez and
Nicaraguan Vice President Jose Rizo, attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The five vice presidents held an informal roundtable meeting
after the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Stein pointed out that the charter of the Organization of the
Central American States stipulates that all governments are committed
to solving disputes by peaceful means. Guatemala supports the ROC
government and people and the notion that all cross-strait disputes
be solved through peaceful means, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Central America suffered from civil wars for many
years and has paid a hefty price for this, adding that these wars
"did not solve any problems, and have only brought more misery to the
people."
</P>
<P>
Rizo also said that Central America has long been a staunch ally
of Taiwan and that his country supports Taiwan's bid to join
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Escobar said that the DPU aims to cement democracy,
adding that before a country can cement its democracy, it must
develop its economy. She said she is appreciative of Taiwan for
stepping up trade exchanges with all countries in the region so that
Central America can develop its economy with the help of Taiwan's
experience.
</P>
<P>
Lopez invited Lu to attend a forum for vice presidents of Central
American countries.

She said that the agricultural and traditional sectors of many
countries in central America have suffered the greatest impact of the

TAIWAN MUST SPEAK OUT AGAINST ANTI-SECESSION LAW: FORMER PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 19 (CNA)

<TEXT>
<P>
The people of Taiwan must bravely voice
their opposition to Beijing's Anti-Secession Law in order to protect
their freedom, former President Lee Teng-hui said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an international academic seminar held at National
Taiwan Normal University, Lee said that the Taiwan people will never
accept the law and that they should stand up against it and make
their voice heard in the international community.
</P>
<P>
Lee also appealed for greater global backing for Taiwan's fight
against Beijing's hegemonic designs and urged the Taiwan people to go
on striving for the country's course based on a Taiwan identity and a
Taiwan-centric concept.
</P>
<P>
As citizens of a democratic nation, the people of Taiwan must be
cognizant of the fact that democracy does not only mean voting, Lee
said, adding that in the face of Beijing's obvious scheme to swallow
Taiwan up, the people of the island must unite regardless of their
ethnicity or region of residence.
</P>
<P>
He praised the recent steps toward reconciliation made by the
ruling and opposition camps for the sake of Taiwan's future, but he
also added that the Taiwan identity must be an indispensable
prerequisite among the parties of different political stances in
their efforts to build a consensus in order to serve the people of
the nation.

DPP SUPPORTS REGISTRATION REQUIREMENT FOR CHINA-BOUND TRAVELERS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  19 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) weighed in the dispute between the
government and air carriers and travel agencies by urging the latter
to abide by the government's regulation and provide to the
Immigration Office under the Ministry of the Interior lists of their
mainland-bound travelers.
</P>
<P>
Legislator William Lai, secretary of the DPP caucus, said the
registration is intended to keep the government informed of local
people's mainland trips and enable it to help Taiwan visitors when
they are involved in accidents on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
This information is also important for the government to
formulate appropriate policy toward mainland China, Lai claimed.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the registration is required under a law revised in
2004, Lai denied that the measure is part of a government plan to
curtail exchanges with the mainland in the wake of Beijing's
enactment of its Anti-Secession Law which authorizes the use of
"non-peaceful means" against Taiwan should the island move toward
independence.
</P>
<P>
Lai said that air carriers, which always keep lists of their
passengers, could easily transfer this information to the Immigration
Office through their computers at little cost. He disputed the tour
industry's claim that this would violate travelers' privacy rights,
arguing that it is permitted by law.
</P>
<P>
Even the current law governing electronic data allows the
government to gather personal information when needed, Lai said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to confirming his caucus' support for the
government's measures, Lai urged the Mainland Affairs Council to help
the tour industry comply with the rules by providing them with a
computer program to allow the easy transfer of the travelers' lists
to the Immigration Office.
</P>
<P>
The dispute arose at the beginning of February when the
Immigration Office asked local travel agencies and air carriers to
provide them with lists on a daily basis of their travelers bound for
the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The office cited as the legal basis for the requirement an
article which had not been used before in the statute governing the
relations between the people of Taiwan and mainland China.
</P>
<P>
The new requirement has caused an uproar among those in the tour
industry. They have questioned the legality, as well as the necessity
of the requirement, not to mention the extra cost it will bring to
them.
</P>
<P>
Hsu Kao-ching, president of the Republic of China Association of
Travel Agents, said Friday that the travel agencies are entrusted by
their customers to arrange their mainland tours and are not supposed
to give out their customers' personal information.
</P>
<P>
If the government wants to have the mainland-bound travelers
registered, the Immigration Office can oblige these travelers to sign
their names at the airport when they leave or arrive in the country,
Hsu argued.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Hsu said, not every travel agency has computers
which are programmed to transfer their information to the Immigration
Office. These agencies will therefore have difficulty complying with
the requirement, he added.
</P>
<P>
For all the trouble it causes, Hsu said, the new regulation
doesn't achieve the government's goal of keeping track of the exact
number of Taiwan people who have traveled to mainland China because
it can't prevent them from visiting the mainland via a third
location.
</P>
<P>
The Board of Airline Representatives in Taiwan joined in the
chorus of criticism Friday, arguing that the Immigration Office
should issue a formal decree to require them to follow this practice
which might infringe on their customers' privacy.
</P>
<P>
Even with such a decree, foreign airlines which operate in Taiwan
claim they will still need the approval of their own countries to
comply with the controversial regulation.
</P>
<P>
An executive of one foreign airline said Friday that he really
doubts that the authorities in his country would ever allow his
airline to give out passengers' personal information.
</P>
<P>
In the worst case scenario, the executive said, the foreign
airlines might be forced to withdraw from the Taiwan market, which he
said would not serve the interests of the country.

CHINA'S ANTI-SECESSION LAW UNTIMELY: TAIWAN OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was untimely and unnecessary for
China to enact the Anti-Secession Law against Taiwan when signs of
cross-Taiwan Strait relations improving were becoming apparent, a
Taiwan official based in the United States said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Andrew L.Y. Hsia, director of the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Office in New York, made the comment on the CNN news show "Diplomatic
License."
</P>
<P>
Hsia pointed out that the launch of special cross-strait charter
flights during this year's Lunar New Year holiday as well as
President Chen Shui-bian's and Premier Frank Hsieh's recent remarks
on cross-strait relations all indicated Taiwan's intention to improve
its relations with China.
</P>
<P>
Hsia said it was unnecessary for Beijing to pass the
Anti-Secession Law to try to change the cross-strait status quo at
this point and he urged the international community, especially the
United Nations, to pay attention to this development.
</P>
<P>
The law enacted by Beijing early this week authorizes the use of
"non-peaceful means" against Taiwan should the island move toward
independence.
</P>
<P>
On Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations, Hsia said the support
voiced by the international community for Taiwan after the passage of
the law indicates that Taiwan has a lot of friends internationally.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that Taiwan will face a lot of difficulties while
trying to gain membership in the United Nations, but he added that
the bid must be continued because the right of the 23 million people
in Taiwan to join the world organization should not be ignored.

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian visited a
Buddhist monastery and an orphanage in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan
Saturday on the first anniversary of the presidential election-eve
assassination attempt against himself and Vice President Annette Lu.
</P>
<P>
The president first paid a visit to Fuoguangshan Temple where he
was warmly greeted by Buddhist masters and followers. The president
burned incense at the major temple of the complex and exchanged gifts
with the new director, Master Hsin Pei, before leaving for Lioukuei
Nursery.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a march launched by the "319 Action Alliance" was held
in Taipei, northern Taiwan to demand the "truth" behind the shooting
on March 19, 2004, in which the president and vice president were
slightly injured.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Presidential Office pointed out that President
Chen has urged the public several times to have faith in the
country's judicial system.
</P>
<P>
The president will mark the day in a warm and peaceful manner, in
contrast to the Kuomintang's (KMT's) approach of taking to the
streets, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
KMT Chairman Lien Chan, as well as Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang
Jin-pyng and Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, both of whom are KMT
vice chairmen, took part in the march.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Annette Lu, who is currently leading a 152-member
delegation on an official visit in Guatemala also spoke about
her feelings regarding last year's shooting.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that she is fully recovered and that she plans to climb
Mount Hsueh (Snow Mountain) on May 20, or the first inauguration of
her second term as the vice president. 
</P>
<P>
Police recently announced a "major breakthrough" in the case,
saying however that the prime suspect had committed suicide 10 days
after the shooting and that the alleged weapon used in the shooting
was not found.
</P>
<P>
The opposition "pan-blue alliance" alleged the shooting was
staged to win sympathy votes in President Chen's bid for re-election.
After Chen won by a razor-thin margin, the alliance filed two
lawsuits to challenge the election and the election result. Both
lawsuits were rejected by the court.

total of 60 full scholarships each year to students from member

</P>
<P>
Lu made the announcement while addressing the opening ceremony of
a DPU American regional meeting in Guatemala. Representatives from
six ROC allies in Central America and five non-allied countries in
the Americas attended the meeting, which was a prelude to the
inauguration of the DPU slated for Aug. 14 in Taipei.

319 MARCH HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH PURSUING 'TRUTH': DPP
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 19 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) and its ally the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) said Saturday
that the "319 March" held by the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) had
nothing to do with pursuing the "truth" behind last year's
presidential election-eve shooting of President Chen Shui-bian and
Vice President Annette Lu.
</P>
<P>
DPP and TSU officials were referring to the march calling for
"truth, democracy and peace" which was held in Taipei Saturday
afternoon to mark the first anniversary of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
William C.T. Lai, DPP caucus whip in the Legislative Yuan, said
that the march had nothing to do with the pursuit of truth, but more
about drumming up support for the KMT.
</P>
<P>
At a critical time when Taiwan should be displaying national
unity in the face of China's recent enactment of the Anti-Secession
Law against Taiwan, the KMT has instead insisted on staging the
march despite all appeals, Lai said.
</P>
<P>
What's more surprising is that Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang
Jin-pyng and Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, both of whom are KMT vice
chairmen, took part in the march, Lai said.
</P>
<P>
The march was an extension of the 2004 presidential election, Lai
claimed, adding that Wang and Ma, both of whom are vying for the KMT
chairmanship, are warming up for their bids to run in the 2008
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Lo Chih-ming, TSU caucus whip in the Legislature, said that the
truth behind the shooting must be left to police investigation,
adding that a march will not solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
Lo also expressed affirmation for People First Party Chairman
(PFP) James Soong's decision not to attend the march.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the march, Premier Frank Hsieh said that it is the right
of the people to express their views, but he urged the participants
in the march to exercise self-restrain and avoid clashes less they
undermine the message they want to drive home.
</P>
<P>
DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang also urged the various parties to set
aside their differences and rally behind the nation to show the
island's unity to the whole world.
</P>
<P>
Su made the remarks in Hsinchu County to solicit support for a
DPP-sponsored march scheduled for March 26 to protest against
mainland China's recent enactment of its Anti-Secession Law.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the PFP alleged the
election-eve shooting was staged to win sympathy votes for President
Chen's bid for re-election. After Chen won by a little more than
25,000 votes out of more than 13 million ballots cast, the alliance
filed two lawsuits to challenge the election and the result of the
election. Both lawsuits were rejected by the court.

foundation chairman Chen Lung-chih said that the issue is of great
significance to the safety and livelihood of the people in Taiwan and
to peace and security in the entire Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The international community must make Beijing realize that its
Anti-Secession Law aimed at Taiwan not only constitutes a violation
of the United Nations' Charter, but also poses a threat to world
peace, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Chen suggested that the government launch a publicity campaign
against the law in Europe and increase the country's international
visibility to relay the strong desire of the Taiwan people for peace
and democracy to the whole world, and to help the E.U. face up to the
serious consequences that a lifting of the arms sales ban would have
in the Taiwan Strait and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Wu Chih-chung, a professor at the Taipei-based Soochow
University, contended that it is just a matter of time before the E.
U. lifts its ban and that Taiwan won't necessarily be a loser if it
does so, pointing out that the lifting of the ban might bring about a
new turning point for Taiwan to step up its strategic partnership
with the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, it is worth noting whether a lifting of the arms
ban will further fan disagreement between what he calls two polarized
geopolitical and strategic blocs that are increasingly taking shape
in East Asia -- one of the United States, Japan and Taiwan, and the
other composed of mainland China, Russia, France and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Chang Yang-pei, a senior researcher at the Taiwan Research
Institute, opined that it is very possible that the E. U. will make a
decision on removing or maintaining the ban this year. He warned of a
serious threat to peace and stability in East Asia and the West
Pacific that may be arising with a better armed China.

'PAN-BLUE ALLIANCE' MARKS 1ST ANNIVERSARY OF 319 SHOOTING WITH MARCH
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 19 (CNA)

<TEXT>
<P>
Supporters of the Kuomintang (KMT) and
People First Party (PFP) took to the streets in Taipei Saturday
afternoon on the first anniversary of the election-eve shooting of
President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu to demand the
"truth" behind the shooting.
</P>
<P>
The protesters, estimated by police at more than 30,000, gathered
at the now-defunct Taipei Tobacco Plant and then marched to the
square in front of the Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
KMT Chairman Lien Chan, as well as Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang
Jin-pyng and Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, both of whom are KMT vice
chairmen, New Party Chairman Yok Mu-ming, lawmakers of the Pan Blue
Alliance formed by the KMT, PFP and New Party, and 319 Truth
Investigation Commission spokeswoman Wang Ching-feng were among the
participants in the march.
</P>
<P>
Notably absent from the march was PFP Chairman James Soong, who
teamed up with Lien to form the "pan-blue alliance" ticket in the
2004 presidential election which they lost to Chen and Lu.
</P>
<P>
Lien, Ma, Wang and Yok took turns in addressing the rally
participants in front of the Presidential Square, lambasting the
government for what they called foot-dragging in probing the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
The election-eve shooting has been alleged by the "pan-blue
alliance" to have been staged in order to gain sympathy votes in
Chen's re-election bid. After Chen won the election, the alliance
filed two lawsuits in an attempt to have the election and the
election result nullified. The two lawsuits were later be rejected by
the courts. Alliance supporters also staged a sit-in in front of the
Presidential Office for several days after the election.
</P>
<P>
Police were out in force to ensure order in Saturday's march,
which turned out to be much more peaceful than the protests
immediately following last year's elections.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Taipei City Mayor Ma Ying-jeou has drawn fire from his
political rivals for taking part in the rally. They claimed that as
the mayor, he should not take part in protest rallies.

Guatemalan President Oscar Berger on
Friday accepted an invitation from visiting Republic of China Vice
President Annette Lu to visit Taiwan in August.
</P>
<P>
Lu, who is currently on a three-day visit in Guatemala, called on
Berger Friday and presented him with a satellite photo of Guatemala
City, capital of the Central American country, taken by the ROC
satellite ROCSAT-II.
</P>
<P>
Lu extended an invitation to Berger to visit Taiwan to attend the

ASIAN GROUP ADOPTS RESOLUTION AGAINST CHINA'S ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  19  (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Council of Asian Liberals and
Democrats (CALD) passed a resolution Saturday to express its regret
at China's enactment of the Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The council urged Beijing to make itself responsible for regional
peace and resume dialogue with Taiwan to resolve their differences.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was adopted during a CALD Executive Committee
meeting held in Taipei and hosted by CALD Secretary-General Hsiao
Bi-khim, who is also a legislator of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party.
</P>
<P>
It was attended by political representatives from the
Philippines, Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar, Malaysia, Singapore and Sri
Lanka.
</P>
<P>
According to the resolution, democracy is a longstanding
principle upheld by the CALD, and the use of non-peaceful means, as
authorized in the Anti-Secession Law, is against the interests and
principles of CALD members.
</P>
<P>
It said the CALD has noticed that the United States, Japan, the
European Union and Australia have expressed their opposition to the
use of force to resolve cross-Taiwan Strait political differences.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
on Friday, Philippine legislator and CALD member Nereus Acosta said
on behalf of the participants of the meeting that the cross-strait
situation is related to the regional security in East Asia and that
no country in Asia wishes to see a war break out across the strait.
</P>
<P>
Acosta said cross-strait differences should be resolved through
peaceful means. He urged Beijing to respect the wish of the Taiwan
people for peace.

TAIWAN SHOULD SET SIGHTS ON 'BRICS': VICE PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 19 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the expected rise of Brazil, Russia,
India and China as the major driving force in the world economy by
mid-century, Taiwan should jockey for position in these "BRIC"
markets in advance through greater investment, Vice Premier Wu Rong-i
said.
</P>
<P>
Wu, who made the call in a speech given at a forum held Friday by
Business Weekly, proposed signing agreements to protect Taiwan
business interests in the four rising economies which have been
forecast to replace the present-day developed countries to become the
engine of global economic growth by 2050 due to their huge
populations and significant industrial and technological skills and
resources.
</P>
<P>
Apart from mainland China, where Taiwan investments accounted for
46 percent of all foreign capital that flowed into the country in
2003, Wu said that Taiwan should further enhance economic ties with
the three other countries and urged efforts to foster foreign trade
personnel with language abilities, particularly the Portuguese and
Russian languages.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Taiwan's annual trade volume with Russia has
grown at a rapid pace of about 16.7 percent per year, he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, Wu was somewhat reserved concerning some of these
countries' determination to advocate a free economy. Pointing to
mainland China as an example, the vice premier claimed that it is
difficult to craft a good policy to couple with an opening market due
to its political system.
</P>
<P>
Yuwa Hedrick-Wong, a leading economic advisor in charge of
Asia-Pacific markets at the MasterCard International, Roopa
Purushothaman, an analyst at the Goldman Sachs investment bank who
first made a report on the "BRICs, " and Paulo A. P. Pinto, director
of the Brazil Business Center in Taipei, also attended the forum.
</P>
<P>
Roopa said that the key to the "BRICs" becoming the major driving
force in the world economy is for them to continue implementing trade
liberalization policies and opening measures.
</P>
<P>
Hedrick-Wong expressed great optimism about the mainland Chinese
economy, saying that a globalized society and economy will push China
to continue opening up, as evidenced by the fact that the country
lowered its customs duties twice over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pinto said Brazil is a lucrative market for Taiwan
businesses, especially in the tourist and motorcycle industries. He
claimed that Brazil is rife with trade and investment opportunities
for Taiwan companies at a time when his country is poised to push for
an integration plan in Latin America.

PRESIDENT SUPPORTS CONSTITUTIONAL COMMISSION TO LOOK INTO 319 SHOOTING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 19 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bain said Saturday
that he supports the formation of a commission that is constitutional
to look into the presidential election-eve shooting of himself and
Vice President Annette Lu last year.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks after he visited Liuokuei Nursery,
an orphanage in Kaohsiung County, southern Taiwan, on the first
anniversary of the shooting incident.
</P>
<P>
Chen earlier visited Fuoguangshan Monastery, also in Kaohsiung,
hoping to use a"warm and peaceful" approach to mark the day,
according to officials from the Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
President Chen said that he supports coordination between the
ruling and opposition parties to form the commission, adding that
Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and People First Party Chairman James
Soong, leaders of the opposition "pan-blue alliance," could serve as
conveners or could nominate a convener.
</P>
<P>
"I will cooperate fully with the investigation work of the
commission, " Chen said, stressing that as he hadn't rigged the
election, he had no fear of the vote-recount demanded by the
"pan-blue alliance." The grueling full recount later confirmed Chen
won the election, but only by a margin of a little more than 25,000
votes, instead of the original figure of 29,518 votes, out of more
than 13 million cast.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that he eagerly wants to know who pulled the trigger on
March 19, 2004, but added that he has no right to tell an ad hoc
investigation team formed to probe the case what to do. He added that
he admired their tenacious work in trying to crack the case in a
situation like "looking for a needle in a haystack."
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his "admiration" for the recent announcement by
the police of a "major breakthrough" in identifying the prime
suspect, although the suspect committed suicide 10 days after the
shooting and the weapon he allegedly used has not been found.
</P>
<P>
On the opposition's promotion of a second commission to look into
the truth of the shooting, the president said that he has never
opposed the forming of such a group, just as he had not opposed or
feared a vote recount after the election.
</P>
<P>
"As long as the commission is formed in line with the
Constitution, I'll give it my full support," he said.
</P>
<P>
A similar "319 truth investigation commission" was formed last
October under a statute passed by the opposition-dominated
Legislative Yuan, but the commission never got anywhere because it
encountered heavy resistance from every government agency that
members visited and couldn't obtain needed information it requested
after the Council of Grand Justices decided that the all-powerful
commission was unconstitutional and wouldn't cooperate.
</P>
<P>
President Chen also made clarification to try to dispel some
persistent doubts and misgivings about the shooting, such as why he
didn't wear a bullet-proof vest while campaigning in the open-topped
jeep.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that he had only worn a bullet-proof vest after being
elected Taipei mayor and after the first time he was elected
president in 2000. He said he never wore the vest while campaigning
for re-election because it never occurred to him that someone might
want to shoot the president.
</P>
<P>
He also said that former President Lee Teng-hui told him that he
had not worn a bullet-proof vest at any time during the presidential
campaign in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing special in the fact that I didn't wear the
bullet-proof vest on March 19, 2004," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Chen also recalled the situation after being shot that day. He
said that before the campaigning in Tainan, southern Taiwan, he
reminded Vice President Annette Lu that the voters in his hometown
were especially passionate and that she should be wary of the
ear-deafening firecrackers in the streets along which they would be
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
Chen recalled that he was in hyped mood with the enthusiastic
supporters lining the streets and that therefore didn't feel any pain
initially when he was shot and insisted on walking into the hospital
himself.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-blue alliance" claimed that the shooting and the ensuing
activation of a national security mechanism which barred many police
and military servicemen, traditionally supporters of the "pan-blue
alliance" parties, from leaving their posts unfairly swayed the
election in Chen's favor. The alliance filed two lawsuits to
challenge the election and the result of the election, but both were
later rejected by the court.

KMT HEAD CALLS FOR SETTING UP 2ND 319 TRUTH INVESTIGATION COMMISSION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 19 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan urged his party's lawmakers Saturday to accelerate legislation
for establishing a special investigation commission to find out the
truth behind the election-eve shooting of President Chen Shui-bian
and Vice President Annette Lu last year.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a rally in front of the Presidential Office to mark
the first anniversary of the shooting, Lien said that there will be
no political reconciliation or peace in Taiwan without an unveiling
of the truth behind the shooting because it is the essence of
Taiwan's new democratic movement and the foundation of democracy to
pursue the truth.
</P>
<P>
"The 'pan-blue alliance' of the KMT and the People First Party
(PFP) can be cheated, " Lien criticized, "but the nation and the
people of Taiwan should not lose."
</P>
<P>
More than 30,000 "pan-blue alliance" supporters took part in
Saturday's march, according to police estimates. The participants
first gathered at the now-defunct Taipei Tobacco Plant and then
marched to the square in front of the Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-blue alliance's" ticket of Lien and PFP Chairman James
Soong narrowly lost last year's presidential election. The alliance
alleges that the election-eve shooting was staged in order to gain
sympathy votes in Chen's re-election bid.
</P>
<P>
After Chen won the election, the alliance filed two lawsuits in
an attempt to have the election and the election result nullified.
The two lawsuits were later rejected by the courts.
</P>
<P>
A commission was formed on Oct. 4, 2004, according to a
controversial statute crafted on the "pan-blue alliance's" terms to
look into the March 19 shooting.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Grand Justices ruled on Dec. 15 that the
commission was partly unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
The commission, however, issued a report Jan. 19 before deciding
to dissolve itself, claiming that the shooting was a campaign scheme
aimed at influencing the outcome of the presidential election and
that the president should be recalled for trampling on the
Constitution and the law.

PREMIER VOWS TO STABILIZE POLITICS TO HELP INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  20 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh vowed Sunday to
stabilize Taiwan's politics to provide a favorable environment for
industrial development.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a ceremony marking the establishment of a sub-group of
the Legislative Yuan, the Legislative Alliance for Science and
Technology, Hsieh noted that stabilizing the domestic political
situation will be the top priority of his administration in the
coming years while accelerating efforts to push for legislation to
facilitate industrial development, particularly that relevant to
high-technology industries.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said that while Taiwan has been ranked exceptionally high
overall by the World Competitiveness Scoreboard published by IMD, a
Switzerland-based business school, as well as the World Economic
Forum Global Competitiveness Report, the country was ranked
relatively poorly in terms of government efficiency and far behind --
below 50th place -- in political stability.
</P>
<P>
He said that an unstable political situation affects not only a
country's global competitiveness ranking but also adversely impacts a
country's overall industrial development.
</P>
<P>
The premier said he attaches great importance to the Legislative
Alliance for Science and Technology and hopes that the group will
become a bridge between the administration and the legislature in
efforts to accelerate legislation to cope the fast-growing and
fast-changing high technology industry.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hsieh said that the Cabinet will cooperate fully with
the investigation work of a proposed new commission to look into the
presidential election-eve shooting of President Chen Shui-bian and
Vice President Annette Lu, so long as the commission is established
legally and constitutionally.
</P>
<P>
"None of the Cabinet members and agencies will resist
investigations to be conducted by the commission should the
commission is constitutional and approved by the Grand Justices, "
Hsieh added.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh was echoing President Chen Shui-bian, who said a day
earlier that he supports the formation of a constitutional commission
to look into the presidential election-eve shootings of March 19,
2004.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he supports coordination between the ruling and
opposition parties to form the commission, adding that Kuomintang
Chairman Lien Chan and People First Party Chairman James Soong,
leaders of the opposition "pan-blue alliance, " could serve as
conveners or could nominate a convener.
</P>
<P>
"I will cooperate fully with the investigation work of the
commission, " Chen said, stressing that as he did not rig the
election, he had no fear of the vote-recount demanded by the
"pan-blue alliance." The grueling full recount later confirmed that
Chen won the election, but only by a margin of a little more than
25,000 votes, instead of the original figure of 29,518 votes, out of
more than 13 million ballots cast.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that he eagerly wants to know who pulled the trigger on
March 19 last year, but added that he has no right to tell an ad hoc
investigation team formed to probe the case what to do. He added that
he admires their tenacious work in trying to crack the case in a
situation that is like looking for a needle in a haystack.
</P>
<P>
"As long as the commission is formed in line with the
Constitution, I'll give it my full support," he said.
</P>
<P>
A similar "319 truth investigation commission" was formed last
October under a statute passed by the opposition-dominated
Legislative Yuan, but the commission got nowhere because it
encountered heavy resistance from every government agency that the
members tried to question and could not obtain information it
requested after the Council of Grand Justices ruled the all-powerful
commission unconstitutional and refused to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-blue alliance" claimed that the shooting and the ensuing
activation of a national security mechanism it claims barred "many"
police and military servicemen -- traditionally supporters of the
"pan-blue alliance" -- from leaving their posts, unfairly swayed the
election in Chen's favor. The alliance filed two lawsuits to
challenge the election and the result of the election, both of which
were thrown out by the courts because the plaintiffs failed to
provide any evidence to support their allegations.

POLICE SEIZE RECORD NUMBER OF GUNS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 20 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police seized a total of 4,354 contraband
guns last year, up a whopping 64.74 percent from the number uncovered
in 2003, according to official tallies released Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) said both the number of
seized factory-made guns and those of home-made or modified guns set
new records. Of the seizures, 2,687 were home-made or modified
pistols and the remainder were standard manufactured rifles or
handguns.
</P>
<P>
Among the 2004 seizures, 276 were powerful rifles, up from 108 in
2001.
</P>
<P>
Over the past four years, CIB officials said the number of seized
illegal firearms has continued to rise, indicating that the gun
smuggling issue has become more serious.
</P>
<P>
As the Cabinet has made crime-fighting a top priority, the
officials said police forces around the nation will step up a
crackdown on firearms smuggling to prevent the issue from further
worsening.

UNILATERAL MEASURES NOT HELPFUL TO RESOLVING CROSS-STRAIT PROBLEMS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  March 19 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taking unilateral measures that can
only escalate tension is not helpful to resolving cross-Taiwan Strait
problems, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
She made the remarks while touching on China's anti-secession law
in an interview with a Japanese TV station during a visit to Tokyo.
The U.S. State Department released the contents of the interview the
same day.
</P>
<P>
Saying that neither side of the Taiwan Strait can resolve the
cross-strait problem on its own, Rice noted that "unilateral measures
that only increase tension rather than reducing them are simply not
helpful."
</P>
<P>
Talking about China's human rights issue and the European Union's
intention to lift its arms sales ban on China, Rice said that despite
the fact that the United States has decided not to seek a human
rights resolution at the U.N. Commission on Human rights this year,
the resolution is "something that comes up every year, " adding,
however, that "the removal of arms embargo doesn't come up every year
and once it's removed, it's removed."
</P>
<P>
"The other thing is that we've made a very clear point that this
is not just human rights, although that's important, but this is also
about the message that it sends about Europe's view of the strategic
balance in the Pacific," she said.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the lifting of the arms embargo has been a
source of concern because of China's rising military strength in the
region, Rice said: "After all, particularly for the United States,
which plays the role of guarantor of stability in that region, it
simply sends the wrong message at a time of rising Chinese military
expenditure to lift the arms embargo."

U.S. STICKS TO OBLIGATION UNDER TRA

<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice reiterated in Tokyo Saturday that Washington will continue to
stick to its obligation under the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA).
</P>
<P>
She also said that the United States will maintain its one-China
policy and oppose any unilateral change to the status quo by either
side of the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Rice, who is visiting Japan, made the comments in an address at
Sophia University in Tokyo. The full text of her speech was released
by the State Department the same day.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the United States has reason to welcome the
rise of China as a confident, peaceful and prosperous country, Rice
said that Washington also wants China as " a global partner, able and
willing to match its growing capabilities to its international
responsibilities."
</P>
<P>
However, she admitted that some issues, particularly Taiwan, have
complicated relations between China and the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Our one-China policy is clear and unchanged. We oppose
unilateral changes to the status quo, whether by word or deed by
either party, " Rice said.
</P>
<P>
Saying that Taipei and Beijing must realize that neither side can
solve the problem alone and should continue to expand recent steps
toward a more productive relationship, Rice reiterated that "in the
interest of peace and stability we stand by our obligations under the
TRA."
</P>
<P>
She also said that the United States can assure basic security as
well as reach out to achieve other goals in the Pacific community
because it knows economic and political openness works.
</P>
<P>
"The ultimate direction of contemporary trends is clear. Openness
is the vanguard of success. Time and again we have seen that economic
and political openness cannot long be separated. Even China must
eventually embrace some form of open, genuinely representative
government if it is to reap the benefits and meet the challenges of a
globalizing world," she said.

ANTI-SECESSION LAW TO INCREASE TENSION IN TAIWAN STRAIT: SCHOLARS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Ottawa,  March 19 (CNA)

<P>
Several scholars from various countries
around the world panned China Saturday for the enactment of its
Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan, saying that it will escalate
tension in the region.
</P>
<P>
The scholars made the criticism at a seminar held by the Canadian
Association for the Studies of International Development to
discuss issues relating to "Taiwan and the International Ccommunity:
Between NGOs, Development Agencies and the United Nations." It was 
presided over by Scott Simon, an associate professor from
Ottawa University.
</P>
<P>
Stephane Corcuff, a professor from Leon University in France, who
served previously as a press officer of the French Institute in
Taipei and has long studied Taiwan issues, said that both China and
the international community have dealt with Taiwan issues unfairly
and that peace should be established on the basis of fairness and
justice.
</P>
<P>
In the conclusion, almost all the participants agreed that China
and Taiwan should engage in peaceful dialogue to reduce tension in
the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Canadian congressmen David Kilgour and Meili Faille, Taiwan's
Representative to Canada Thomas Chen, and other staff of his office
also attended the seminar.

ROC VP LAUNCHES 'CULTURAL DIPLOMACY' IN GUATEMALA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Guatemala City,  March 19 (CNA)
(By Yang Chia-hui and Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Republic of China Vice President
Annette Lu signed a letter of intent with her Guatemalan counterpart
Friday, promising Taiwan aid to help restore and preserve buildings
and historical sites there that have been repeatedly damaged by
earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
Unlike all other economic and technological aid programs that
Taiwan has engaged in with its allied countries, this marks the first
"cultural diplomacy" launched by any political leader from Taiwan to
help preserve historical sites and enhance bilateral cultural ties
with a diplomatic ally, she said.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary plans, Taiwan will help restore and
renovate Museum Pilar de Zaragoza and Monastery Sor Juana located in
Antigua City, a monumental city founded in 1543 with strong Spanish
colonial influence.
</P>
<P>
Restoration and renovation of the two historical sites are
expected to be completed in two years, with a budget of around
US$700,000, said Wu Ching-fa, vice chairman of the Council of
Cultural Affairs, who is among Lu's 152-member entourage.
</P>
<P>
Lu signed the letter of intent with Guatemalan Vice President
Eduardo Stein Friday in a ceremony witnessed by President Oscar
Berger.
</P>
<P>
Lu and her group toured the city of Antigua Saturday with Antigua
Mayor Antonio Siliezar Portillo. At the same time, Lu and Siliezar
jointly announced the restoration and renovation project.
</P>
<P>
Throughout its history, the city now known as Antigua Guatemala,
or La Antigua, has been repeatedly damaged by earthquakes, and always
the Antiguan-style buildings have been rebuilt. But on July 29, 1773,
earthquakes wrought such destruction that officials petitioned the
King of Spain to allow them to move the capital to safer ground,
which led to the founding in 1776 of present-day Guatemala City.
</P>
<P>
Antigua was left to rusticate, largely but never completely
abandoned. Today, its monumental bougainvillea-draped ruins and its
preserved and carefully restored Spanish colonial public buildings
and private mansions form a city of charm and romance unequaled in
the Americas. In 1979, UNESCO recognized Antigua Guatemala as a
Cultural Heritage of Mankind site.
</P>
<P>
Touring the city, Lu said that Guatemala is a country blessed
with rich cultural heritage. She said she was moved deeply by
Guatemala's historical and architectural magnificence the first time
she visited the country nine months ago.
</P>
<P>
The first thing she did after returning to Taiwan was to meet
officials and scholars to work out a plan to help Guatemala preserve
its cultural heritage, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Lu also gave Siliezar a satellite photo of Antigua City taken by
the ROC satellite ROCSAT-II and invited Siliezar to visit Taiwan in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
The vice president also expressed hope that Antigua City will
give seedlings of Guatemala's national flower and national tree to
Taiwan as a gift so that a beautiful Latin garden can be nurtured in
Taipei City.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Siliezar offered his deep gratitude to Taiwan,
saying that Taiwan's unselfish compassion shown to Guatemala is
especially respectable at a time when Taiwan is under military
threat from China.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, the museum and monastery restoration project is
a highly rewarding program, earning the appreciation and respect from
the Guatemalan people on one hand and helping Taiwan further broaden
its support base overseas on the other.
</P>
<P>
Professor Chang Po-shuo from National Cheng Kung University
(NCKU), one of the scholars on the team in charge of the restoration
project, said that the project will be jointly planned and undertaken
by people from NCKU and Guatemala's San Carlos University. The two
schools will also knot sisterhood ties because of the project, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Lu and her entourage are scheduled to wrap up their three-day
visit to Guatemala Sunday and will return to Taiwan, making a transit
stay in Miami.

SUB-GROUP ESTABLISHED TO PUSH FOR LEGISLATION ON SCI-TECH DEVELOPMENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 20 (CNA)

<TEXT>
<P>
A sub-group of the Legislative Yuan, the
Legislative Alliance for Science and Technology (LAST), was formally
established Sunday to push for legislation to cope with the
fast-growing and fast-changing high technology industry.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a ceremony marking the establishment of the LAST,
Premier Frank Hsieh said he attaches great importance to the alliance
and hopes that the group will help bridge differences between the
administration and the legislature in efforts to accelerate
legislation on affairs pertaining to sci-tech industrial development.
</P>
<P>
The LAST was jointly established by 20 lawmakers from across the
political spectrum, with Lee Yung-ping, a legislator from the
opposition People First Party named as the convener and Legislator
Kuo Cheng-liang from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and
legislators Lee Chi-chu and Wu Chih-yang from the opposition
Kuomintang as deputy conveners.
</P>
<P>
The LAST is open to all legislators interested in pushing for
legislation governing sci-tech industrial development and related
affairs, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that government operations and laws and regulations have
always lagged behind the development of high technology, Lee said
that the LAST is committed to filling the gap and helping bolster
interaction and understanding among the government, the legislature
and the industry.
</P>
<P>
To function as a communication platform for the administration,
legislature and industry, the LAST will initially focus its attention
on legislation on affairs pertaining to digitalization of information
and communication industries, the digital-content business,
intellectual property rights, radio frequency ID systems, the
biotechnology industry and the competitiveness of Taiwan's
sci-tech industries, Lee added.

PFP URGED NOT TO BOYCOTT PROPOSED ARMS PROCUREMENT STATUTE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 20 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) legislator called on the legislative caucus of the opposition
People First Party (PFP) Sunday to refrain from boycotting the
inclusion of a statute governing major arms procurements in the
agenda of the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Lai Ching-teh, a whip of the DPP legislative caucus, made the
appeal after the PFP legislative caucus said at a recent news
conference that it will be against the inclusion of the
Cabinet-proposed "statute for major arms procurements" on the agenda
of the legislature.
</P>
<P>
The proposed statute regarding a plan to buy six Patriot PAC-III
anti-missile batteries, eight diesel-electric submarines and a
squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft from the United States
was approved by the Cabinet last Wednesday and presented immediately
to the legislature for discussion.
</P>
<P>
The ceiling for the procurement package was marked down from the
original NT$610.8 billion to NT$480 billion (US$15.48 billion) in the
new proposal because a plan to build the submarines in Taiwan was
dropped, while the new Taiwan dollar has appreciated against the U.S.
currency.
</P>
<P>
Lai said that the DPP legislative caucus will take the initiative
to negotiate the issue with its PFP counterpart in the hope that the
proposed statute can be included on the legislature's agenda for
March 25 and passed on to a legislative committee for review.
</P>
<P>
Terming the draft statute a major indicator of reconciliation and
cooperation between the ruling and opposition parties, Lai said that
both President Chen Shui-bian and PFP Chairman James Soong also
voiced their support for the proposal in a 10-point declaration
issued in the wake of their Feb. 24 meeting.
</P>
<P>
Should the PFP legislative caucus block the draft statute from
being included on the legislative agenda, it will trigger misgivings
among the public about the Chen-Soong meeting, Lai explained, adding
that neither party wants to see this.
</P>
<P>
A similar proposed statute, together with a proposed special
budget for the procurement, was shelved and blocked by the previous
legislature owing to objections from the majority "pan-blue alliance"
of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and PFP, which thought the package
was too expensive.

90% OF TAIWAN PEOPLE OPPOSE CHINA'S ANTI-SECESSION LAW

<P>
Over 90 percent of the people of the
Republic of China are opposed to China's newly enacted Anti-Secession
Law aimed at Taiwan, ROC representative to Malaysia Wu Wen-ya said
Sunday, quoting the results of a recent public opinion survey.
</P>
<P>
As many as 93 percent of the respondents said they do not support
the Anti-Secession Law because it will not only hurt the people of
Taiwan but will also sabotage relations between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, Wu went on, more than 90 percent of
those polled expressed support for maintaining the cross-Taiwan
Strait status quo and using peaceful means to resolve disputes
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks during a meeting with reporters in Malaysia.
Also present at the meeting were Hung Jung-min, a member of the
Cabinet-level Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and Chiu Chi,
director of the Press Division under the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Office in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Hung said that the unification versus independence debate should
be resolved by plebiscite, adding that should cross-strait political
leaders resolve the issue based upon the results of a referendum
exclusively for the people of Taiwan, it would be acceptable for the
Taiwan public.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that the authorities on either side of the Taiwan
Strait set aside the unification versus independence debate and
concentrate on stepping up bilateral economic and cultural exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lee Fang-hsin, chairman of the Malaysia-based
Association of Taiwanese Manufacturers, said amajority of China-based
Taiwanese businessmen are afraid of Beijing's Anti-Secession Law and
that some of them are considering relocating their investments
elsewhere.

 According to Lee, people have the right to be free of terror.

TAIWAN INVESTMENT IN CHINA ON CONTINUOUS RISE: MOEA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 20 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan investment in China has increased
by leaps and bounds over the past five years, officials from the
Investment Commission under the Ministry of Economic Affairs said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Having surged in both scale and scope, the amount of China-bound
investments constituted an alarmingly high 67.24 percent of the
entire investment that Taiwan made overseas in 2004, commission
officials said.
</P>
<P>
According to tallies compiled by the Investment Commission,
Taiwan businessmen channeled some US$41.94 billion into China in
33,314 investment projects between January 1991 and February
2005.
</P>
<P>
However, according to figures released by the Chinese
authorities, Taiwan businessmen had committed some US$77.37 billion
for 63,616 projects in China as of September 2004, although only
US$39.37 billion was actually implemented.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's China-bound investment also soared proportionally in
terms of ratio of investment in China and Taiwan's overall investment
overseas, commission officials said.
</P>
<P>
Investment Commission statistics show that China-bound investment
constituted 33.93 percent of Taiwan's entire investment overseas in
2000, gradually climbing to 38.8 percent in 2001, 53.38 percent in
2002, 53.66 percent in 2003 and 67.24 percent in 2004.
</P>
<P>
China has not only become the top absorber of Taiwan investment,
the proportion has also increased to surpass two-thirds, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
By industry, they added, the electronics industry has remained
the largest investor over the past five years, making up 41 percent
of the entire Taiwan investment in China. In 2000, Taiwan's
electronics industry invested US$1.5 billion in China, a figure that
had shot up to US$3 billion by 2004.
</P>
<P>
The metal industry followed, constituting 9 percent, followed by
the chemical and plastics industries with 7 percent, and non-metal
industries with 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan investment in China's service sector has also grown
considerably to reach 4.04 percent, or US$1.065 billion, of the
entire Taiwan investment in China over the past five years, the
officials added.

<P>
The Department of Health (DOH) will join
forces with the private sector to halve the domestic tuberculosis
(TB) incidence and death rate in 10 years, a senior official said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Lin Ting, deputy director of the DOH's Center for Disease
Control, made the remarks at an award-presentation ceremony honoring
those who have contributed to local TB prevention as part of the
activities to mark the March 24 World Tuberculosis Day.
</P>
<P>
Quoting DOH tallies, Lin said about 15,000 new TB cases are
reported in Taiwan each year and that an average of 1,300 local
people succumb to the disease annually.
</P>
<P>
"Although tuberculosis is an old disease, it is the most serious
statutory communicable disease in Taiwan, " Lin said, adding that the
TB death rate is the highest among all communicable illnesses in
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lin said Taiwan's TB incidence rate is 13 times that of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
"In the United States, the TB incidence rate is 5.1 people out of
every 100,000, compared to 66.67 people in Taiwan and 24.8 people in
Japan," Lin said.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the TB death rate, Lin said, the ratio is 0.3 people
out of every 100,000 in the United States, 1.9 people in Japan and
5.8 people in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan still has ample room to improve TB prevention
and control, Lin said the DOH hopes to join forces with the private
sector to lower the disease's incidence and death rate by 50 percent
in the coming 10 years.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that it will not be easy to realize these goals.
"Strenuous efforts and close coordination between medical and
public health personnel will be necessary to realize our
goals," he added.
</P>
<P>
As far as TB prevention is concerned, Lin said identification of
TB patients is a very important and difficult task.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot just rely on chest X-rays. Examination of sputum is
equally important. The DOH has designated nine sputum examination
centers around the island with a view to identifying TB patients in
the shortest possible period of time," Lin said.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the establishment of a comprehensive negative-pressure
quarantine ward system during the fight against the severe acute
respiratory syndrome epidemic in 2003, Lin said those well-equipped
quarantine wards have become an important resource in the fight
against TB.
</P>
<P>
Lin further said a particular problem in the TB-fighting campaign
lies in the fact that more than half of the patients are over 65
years of age and have often stopped taking medication, hindering the
treatment of the disease and enhancing the risk of spread.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin, TB patients can fully recover so long as they
take prescription drugs regularly for six to nine months.

PRESIDENT CALLS FOR PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR MARCH 26 RALLY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 20 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian called on the
public Sunday to take part in a March 26 rally to protest China's
Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan, claiming that popular force is
the best weapon to safeguard the nation.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while offering his respects to the spirit
of the late Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Huang
Hsin-chieh in front of his tomb at a public cemetery in Taipei
County.
</P>
<P>
In the face of China's newly enacted Anti-Secession Law, the
president said, the people of Taiwan should take courage and
participate in the DPP-initiated demonstration to voice discontent
with the law.
</P>
<P>
Chen spoke highly of Huang and several pro-democracy activists
during Taiwan's martial law era, such as Yin Hai-kuang, Fu
Cheng and Lei Chen, for their courage in challenging the former
Kuomintang government while facing injustice, saying the
pro-democracy seniors used their precious lives to demonstrate that
"as long as we are on the right side of history, we will never feel
lonely."
</P>
<P>
Noting that Beijing has been doing everything possible to annex
Taiwan, Chen said the Taiwan public should join together to
safeguard the nation.
</P>
<P>
He further said that over 200 civic groups have decided to take
part the March 26 demonstration to show their love for Taiwan,
democracy and peace. He did not say whether he will take part in the
demonstration.
</P>
<P>
China's rubber-stamp parliament -- the National People's Congress
-- passed the Anti-Secession Law last Monday to provide the Beijing
authorities with a legal basis for using non-peaceful means against
Taiwan if the island moves toward independence.

LEGISLATURE URGED TO PASS NATIONAL ASSEMBLY BILL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   March  20  (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A private constitutional amendment
supervision group called on the Legislative Yuan Sunday to pass a
draft bill on the exercise of power by the mission-oriented National
Assembly as soon as possible to facilitate its task of reviewing a
package of sweeping constitutional amendment proposals.
</P>
<P>
The Cheng Hsin (Sincere and Credible) Constitutional Amendment
Supervision Alliance, formed by several civic organizations such as
the Judicial Reform Foundation, the Alliance for Parliamentary Reform
Actions (APRA) and the Taipei Society, made the appeal during a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
APRA Convener Lu Hsiu-chu said that members of the constitutional
amendment supervision organization will call on the legislative
caucuses of the ruling and opposition parties and push for them to
support the early passage of the draft bill.
</P>
<P>
The alliance will not rule out adopting radical steps, including
mobilizing its members to surround the legislature and stage hunger
strikes in an attempt to force the legislature to pass the draft bill
as soon as it can, Lu said, adding that the organization will also
consider fielding its candidates for the National Assembly elections
to be held in May.
</P>
<P>
According to Taipei Society President Hung Yu-hung, the alliance
insists that delegates to the mission-oriented National Assembly will
only be responsible for voting on various constitutional amendment
proposals adopted by the legislature at an extraordinary session last
August. Consequently, Hung stressed, the voting procedures should be
simplified and the meeting should have to last for only three days.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the threshold for a second-round vote on the
constitutional amendment proposals should be based upon approval by a
half of the delegates instead of three quarters, adding that the
latter is too high and is against the spirit of a second-round vote
as stated in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Among the constitutional amendment proposals passed by the
legislature are halving of the number of seats in the 225-seat
legislature, the adoption of a "single seat, two votes" electoral
system for the legislature, the abrogation of the National Assembly,
and the inclusion of the right to hold referendums written into the
Constitution.

PRO-DEMOCRACY ACTIVISTS LAUNCH 'QUITTING CCP' CAMPAIGN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  March 19 (CNA)
(By Wennie Chi and Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of exiled mainland Chinese
pro-democracy activists staged a rally on the Capitol Hill in
Washington, D.C. Saturday to call for support for a "quitting the
Chinese Communist Party (CCP)" campaign.
</P>
<P>
Among the demonstrators was Wei Jinsheng, a renowned exiled
mainland political dissident. Wei joined his fellow mainland
pro-democracy activists in singing a Taiwan-originating Mandarin pop
song "Wake Up When Dream Goes By" with adapted lyrics to accentuate
their aversion to the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators carried English posters bearing words "Say
bye-for-good to CCP." Some posters were written in Chinese with words
standing for "CCP is moving toward collapse in an unique way."
</P>
<P>
Organizers said the rally was also aimed at celebrating the warm
response to the "quitting the CCP" campaign. They said since the
campaign was launched last December, more than 377,000 CCP members
around the world have renounced their membership.

U.S. OFFERS CHEAPER PRICE FOR PATRIOT PAC III: MND REPORT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 20 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States has offered a cheaper
price for the Patriot PAC III anti-missile system to be sold to
Taiwan, according to a Ministry of National Defense (MND) report sent
to the Legislative Yuan Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The report said the U.S. military has agreed to deduct the
research and development cost from the Patriot PAC III price to be
offered to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, each Patriot PAC III missile to be sold
to Taiwan carries a price tag of about US$3.01 million, lower than
the US$3.2 million price offered to the Netherlands and Japan.
</P>
<P>
In the face of China's ever mounting missile threat, the MND
report said Taiwan badly needs to purchase the Patriot anti-missile
defense system.
</P>
<P>
"As China has pointed hundreds of tactical missiles at Taiwan, we
urgently need to purchase anti-missile defense system to safeguard
our national security," the report said.
</P>
<P>
At present, the report said, the military's anti-missile system
can only protect northern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Patriot PAC III anti-missile batteries can be
flexibly deployed and fired by a remote-controlled system, the report
said the planned procurement of six Patriot PAC IIIs is aimed at
beefing up the nation's anti-missile defense capabilities.
</P>
<P>
"Once we acquire the new anti-missile defense system, we'll be
able to protect major cities in northern, central and southern parts
of the island as well as major strategic locations from China's
missile attacks," the report said, adding that the new batteries are
expected to offer protection for 70 percent of local population and
more than 60 percent of industrial production facilities.
</P>
<P>
The six Patriot PAC III anti-missile batteries are part of a
package of advanced weapons Taiwan intends to buy from the UNited
States. The package also includes eight diesel-electric submarines
and a squadron of 12 Orion P-3C anti-submarine aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet already approved the MND's proposal to mark down the
budget ceiling for the procurement package from the original NT$610.8
billion to NT$480 billion (US$15.48 billion) after a plan to build
the submarines in Taiwan was dropped and the new Taiwan dollar has
appreciated against the U.S. currency in recent months.
</P>
<P>
The revised procurement proposal will soon be referred to the
opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan for screening and approval.
The MND report about the Patriot PAC III's performance and price tag
was part of the ministry's efforts to seek legislative support for
the bill.
</P>
<P>
The arms procurement package has been stalled for a long time.
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislative caucus
urged the opposition camp Sunday to stop boycotting the package for
the sake of national interests.
</P>
<P>
DPP legislative whip Lai Ching-teh said he keenly hopes the
opposition People First Party (PFP) can agree to include the package
into the March 25 legislative screening agenda to allow for rational
debate on the arms procurement issue.
</P>
<P>
Lai said that the DPP legislative caucus will take the initiative
to negotiate the issue with its PFP counterpart in the hope that the
proposed statute can be included on the legislature's agenda for the
March 25 session and passed on to a legislative committee for further
review.
</P>
<P>
Terming the package as a major measurement of reconciliation and
cooperation between the ruling and opposition parties, Lai said that
both President Chen Shui-bian and PFP Chairman James Soong have
voiced their support for the proposal in a 10-point joint statement
issued at the end of their high-profile Feb. 24 meeting.
</P>
<P>
Should the PFP legislative caucus block the package from being
included on the legislative agenda, it will trigger misgivings among
the public about the significance of the Chen-Soong meeting, Lai
explained, adding that neither party wants to see this.

CHINA'S RISE MEANS BOTH CRISIS AND OPPORTUNITY FOR TAIWAN: PREMIER

(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Sunday China's
rise as a regional military power means both a crisis and an
opportunity for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the remarks while attending an annual meeting of an
association of students who had pursued advanced studies in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh, who once did advanced study in law at Kyoto University in
the Japanese ancient capital of Kyoto, said China's military
expansion and bellicosity pose a threat to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Hsieh said, China's rise a regional military power
has alarmed many free and democratic countries. For instance, the
United States and Japan have for the first time included the Taiwan
Strait security as one of their common strategic objective in their
recent joint defense statement.
</P>
<P>
In his view, Hsieh said, the development offers an opportunity
for Taiwan to strengthen substantive exchanges with Japan.
</P>
<P>
It has not been easy to expand Taiwan-Japan relations, Hsieh
said, adding that Taiwan should grasp the new opportunity to develop
closer ties with Japan.

JAPANESE DELEGATION VISITS KINMEN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Kinmen,   March  20  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Japanese delegation, headed by
Tokuichiro Tamazawa, a member of the lower house of the Japanese
Diet, toured Taiwan's frontline island of Kinmen Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The delegation visited the Shuitou port where a Kinmen ferry boat
was carrying Taiwan passengers back to Kinmen from mainland China's
Xiamen port and a mainland ferry boat was waiting for taking Kinmen
passengers to Xiamen.
</P>
<P>
Tamazawa said he was impressed by such direct shipping services
across the Taiwan Strait, also known as the "mini three links."
</P>
<P>
The "mini three links" refer to direct shipping, mail and trade
links between Taiwan-held Kinmen/Matsu and Xiamen/Mawei in the
southeastern mainland province of Fujian. Direct cross-strait
transportation links have been suspended for more than five decades,
but Taiwan has opened Kinmen and Matsu for direct shipping links with
Fujian as part of its efforts to promote cross-strait rapprochement.
Kinmen and Matsu lie closer to Fujian than to Taiwan. Tamazawa said
he believes that the opening of the "mini three links" will
contribute to cross-strait peace and stability in East Asia.
</P>
<P>
Tamazawa said he hopes Taiwan's government authorities will allow
foreign citizens to travel from Kinmen directly to Xiamen by ship in
the future. "I'm interested in making such a direct voyage, " he
added.
</P>
<P>
The delegation is composed of Japanese Diet members and other
elected representatives and senior executives of several pro-Taiwan
civic groups. Tamazawa and delegation members met with Kinmen County
Magistrate Lee Chu-feng in the morning and also toured major Kinmen
tourist attractions. The delegation arrived in Taiwan Friday for a
goodwill visit.

<TEXT>
<P>
The planned March 26 march in Taipei
against China's anti-secession law is aimed at accentuating Taiwan's
aspirations for peace, democracy and security, a former top mainland
policy planner said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Tsai Ing-wen, who had been Mainland Affairs Council
chairwoman before becoming a lawmaker, said the upcoming march
against China's newly enacted law targeting Taiwan is of great
significance.
</P>
<P>
"The protest march is very important. It will inspire Taiwan
people to reflect on the crisis across the Taiwan Strait as well as
let the world understand local people's resolve to pursue democracy,
peace and security," Tsai said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that brute force or non-peaceful means should never be
an option in maintaining any form of relationship, Tsai said China's
so-called anti-secession law violates this basic principle of a
civilized society.
</P>
<P>
"The March 26 protest march will caution the international
community that China's anti-secession law is a potential threat not
only to Taiwan but also to the whole world, " Tsai said, adding that
the street parade is an expression of Taiwan people's feelings and
aspirations. Tsai made the remarks at a news conference held by the
Democracy, Peace, Protect Taiwan Alliance which is organizing the
March 26 protest march.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of major social groups who will mobilize their
members to join the street parade through major streets in Taipei
also spoke at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
Taipei Society President Hung Yu-hung said the society will for
the first time in more than 10 years join the street parade to tell
the world that no other country can decide on the future of the
people of Taiwan and to show Taiwan people's resolve to protect their
present democratic way of life and their self-determination right.
</P>
<P>
Many ruling Democratic Progressive Party officials and lawmakers
also attended the news conference to introduce the signs, slogans,
commemorative badges to be used in the event.

DECISION ON WHETHER U.S. DEFENDS TAIWAN UP TO PRESIDENT: U.S. GENERAL

<P>
It's up to the U.S. president to
decide whether the United States will defend Taiwan if China attacks
the island, a top U.S. military official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Gen. Richard Myers, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff,
made the comments while responding to questions in an interview on
NBC's "Meet the Press" program.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the United States would defend Taiwan if Beijing
deemed it necessary to use "non-pacific means" against Taiwan as is
authorized in China's recently enacted Anti-Secession Law, Myers
said: "Obviously, the president makes that policy and makes those
decisions, and the military will do what we have to do."
</P>
<P>
Pointing to the fact that President George W. Bush has stated
that there should be no change in the Taiwan Strait status quo by
force by either side, the general said: "Clearly, its not in
anybody's interest to settle this by force."
</P>
<P>
The program also showed a videotape of President Bush's previous
remarks relating to the U.S. stance on defending Taiwan. The
president said in 2001 that the United States has an obligation to
defend Taiwan and that it would do "whatever it took to help Taiwan
defend herself, that's our policy."

BEIJING MUST CLARIFY ANTI-SECESSION LAW TO RICE: MAC VICE CHAIRMAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 21 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Beijing authorities must clarify to
visiting U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice the "non-peaceful
means" clause of China's recently enacted Anti-Secession Law
targeting Taiwan, a top Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) official said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Outgoing MAC Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san also said that Rice is
expected to stress Washington's firm stance to Beijing that the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait should engage in constructive exchanges
and resume peaceful dialogue to resolve their differences.
</P>
<P>
Rice arrived in Beijing Sunday for a two-day visit on the last
leg of her six-nation Asian tour. She met with Chinese President Hu
Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao on her first day and is scheduled to
meet with Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his last press conference as MAC vice chairman, Chiu
said that major nations around the world have expressed their
concerns about the enactment of the law which he said has raised
tensions in the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Chiu, who has resigned to run for the magistrate seat in the
central county of Taichung, also said that Rice is expected to
express the U.S. position that any unilateral moves that increases
tensions are not helpful and that the Anti-Secession Law is not
helpful in reducing cross-strait tensions,
</P>
<P>
Chiu added that Beijing has not clarified to the international
community under what conditions exactly it would be authorized by the
law to use "non-peaceful means" against Taiwan, saying that this has
caused great concern around the globe.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lai Ching-teh, a legislative whip of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), said that the DPP caucus salutes
Rice's determination in maintaining peace and stability in the
Asia-Pacific region and the way she has conveyed U.S. opposition to a
possible lifting of the European Union's arms embargo against China.
</P>
<P>
Lai said that prior to arriving in Beijing, Rice had expressed
her concerns in Japan and South Korea over China's growing defense
budgets and military buildup.
</P>
<P>
Rice also reiterated the U.S. position of opposing any unilateral
moves to change the status quo across the Taiwan Strait, Lai added.

Presidential Office Secretary-General Yu
Shyi-kun said Monday that he believes there will certainly be a
second meeting between President Chen Shui-bian and opposition People
First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Yu said while meeting with reporters that
currently, he and PFP Secretary-General Chin Chin-sheng have no plans
to meet with each other to make preparations for a second Chen-Soong
meeting.
</P>
<P>
In their meeting Feb. 24, Chen and Soong reached consensus on
various issues relating to constitutional reform, cross-strait
relations and other matters.

In response to recent media reports that the president would meet
with Soong again, Yu said it wouldn't be a surprise as the two had

</P>
<P>
Asked when the second Chen-Soong meeting would take place, Yu
said that it's up to the staff of the two camps to work out a plan.

RICE URGES CHINA TO COOL CROSS-STRAIT TENSIONS CAUSED BY NEW LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Beijing,   March  21  (CNA)
(By Liao Chen-yi and Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Visiting U.S. Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice urged Beijing at a news conference Monday to take
steps to cool tensions that have flared across the Taiwan Strait
since the passage of the Anti-Secession Law, describing the law as an
unwelcome piece of legislation.
</P>
<P>
Noting that cross-Taiwan Strait issues should be resolved by the
two sides themselves in a peaceful manner, Rice said that any
unilateral moves that increase tensions are not helpful and that the
Anti-Secession Law is not helpful in reducing cross-strait tensions.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Rice met with Chinese Foreign Minister Li
Zhaoxing for a talk. Rice reportedly said to Li that the United
States' "one China" policy and its commitment to the Three
Communiques remain unchanged, but the obligations under the Taiwan
Relations Act demand that the United States make clear to both
parties that unilateral moves are not helpful.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating Washington's concerns over the development of
cross-strait relations, Rice stressed that cross-strait differences
must be resolved peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Rice focused on the common interest of a more peaceful and secure
Asia-Pacific region. She also pushed China to improve its human
rights while warning that the North Korea nuclear standoff cannot go
on forever.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Li told Rice that the Taiwan issue remains the
biggest challenge in Beijing-Washington relations and whether this
issue can be properly handled will directly affect how U.S.-China
relations unfold.
</P>
<P>
Rice was to leave the Chinese capital later Monday at the end of
her six-nation Asian tour that has also taken her to India,
Afghanistan, Pakistan, Japan and South Korea.

MND DENIES REPORT ABOUT FORMING 400-MEMBER SPECIAL FORCE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 21 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of National Defense Monday
denied the existence of any plan to organize an additional elite unit
for counter-terrorism or to guard against a "decapitation strike"
from China as reported by local media.
</P>
<P>
Fielding questions at a Legislative Yuan Defense Committee
meeting, both Vice Minister of National Defense Huo Shou-yeh and Army
Commander-in-Chief Gen. Chu Kai-sheng said the media report about a
plan to form a "400-member special force" was only speculation.
</P>
<P>
According to the media report, the ROC Army is planning to
organize a 400-member elite unit to cope with possible terrorist
attacks and China's "decapitation attack" against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Decapitation strategies short-circuit command and control
systems, wipe out nationwide nerve centers and leave the opponent
hopelessly immobilized. Many military observers say the mainland is
very likely to use this strategy to invade Taiwan by seizing the
island's center of power, the capital and its top leaders.
</P>
<P>
Under the Cabinet's counter-terrorism action plan, Huo said, the
military is tasked with offering necessary support. Against this
backdrop, Huo said, the military is determined to beef up its special
forces' combat capabilities.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Huo stressed that the military has no plan to
organize a new 400-member elite unit.
</P>
<P>
Huo also denied a media report about the defense ministry having
a plan to spend a large sum of money to open special production lines
to manufacture equipment or weapons needed by the existing special
forces.
</P>
<P>
"The report is not true," Huo said, adding that while some of the
weapons or equipment needed by the special forces are produced at
home, many other items are procured from abroad.
</P>
<P>
As the number of each item needed by the special forces is not
large, Huo said the military has traditionally not needed a special
production line to produce a specific item to meet the demand of
special forces.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Army Commander-in-Chief Chu
Kai-sheng said the Iraq War shows that modern warfare mainly features
combined services attacks.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, special forces will play a critical role in future
warfare. We must beef up our combat capabilities and equipment used
by special forces, " Chu said. But he added that the ROC Army has no
plan to form an elite "counter-terrorism" or special force to counter
an attempted decapitation strike.

UMC CASE WILL BE HANDLED FAIRLY: ECONOMICS MINISTER

<TEXT>
<P>
The court case involving United
Microelectronics Corp. (UMC) will be handled impartially, Minister of
Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh said Monday.
</P>
<P>
UMC, the world's second-largest chip foundry after Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., has been charged with unlawfully
passing on capital and technology to Chinese-based He Jian Technology
Co. in Suzhou. UMC headquarters and factories in Taipei and Hsinchu
were searched by prosecutors Feb. 15 and as of Monday, 25 current and
former UMC employees have been investigated.
</P>
<P>
UMC Chairman Robert Tsao ran an advertisement in major newspapers
Monday - - the second time he has done this -- saying that UMC helped
He Jian, who in turn paid for the assistance with 15 percent of its
stock, worth some US$110 million.
</P>
<P>
Tsao also said UMC wrote a letter to the Investment Commission
under the Ministry of Economic Affairs March 18 to ask for
administrative guidance so that the stocks could be smoothly
transferred to UMC.
</P>
<P>
Noting that all transfers of corporate stocks involve the issue
of investment, Ho said that the UMC case will be dealt with
impartially.
</P>
<P>
Since the UMC-He Jian stock transfer is an investment issue, Ho
said, it should not have been carried out without prior government
approval.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Ho said, UMC's "help" to He Jian involved technical
cooperation, something that also needed government permission. Ho
said that the economics ministry will find out whether UMC's
technical assistance to He Jian occurred before the Statue Governing
the Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland
Area was amended or afterward.
</P>
<P>
Should the "technical cooperation" have occurred before the
statute was amended, then UMC will only be fined up to NT$25 million
(US$800,000) . If it occurred after the statute was amended, UMC
employees involved could face jail terms, Ho said.

HACKING IS NO GAME FOR ACCUSED SOUTH KOREAN CYBER GAME ENGINEER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 21 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An engineer with a South Korean company
that makes cyber games was arrested Monday for allegedly breaking
into the computer system of a Taiwanese competitor and stealing vital
business information, the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean computer engineer, surnamed Lee, was accused by
Taiwan's cyber game company INSREA of penetrating the company's
Internet firewall and stealing business intelligence and deleting
vital corporate uplink data, CIB investigators said.
</P>
<P>
Lee, who was assigned to Taipei by his South Korean company
Webzen, was arrested at his Taipei County home and was handed over to
the Taipei Prosecutors' Office for further questioning.
</P>
<P>
According to CIB investigators, INSREA and Webzen were business
partners until they had a falling out in recent months due to
competition and conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
After examining and cross-comparing computer data provided by
INSREA, CIB investigators concluded that Lee was the one who hacked
into INSREA's system and destroyed information after the two
companies ended their partnership last August.
</P>
<P>
During Monday's questioning, Lee said that INSREA was the sole
agent of Webzen products in the Taiwan area. After it established its
own branch office in Taipei, Webzen wanted to retrieve part of the
operational business rights for some of the games in Taiwan, so he
was assigned to Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Lee denied the hacking accusation, claiming that for the
convenience of data transfer, he was authorized by INSREA to use that
company's Internet protocol (IP) and he changed some relevant
information while INSREA staff looked on.
</P>
<P>
But the INSREA people said, according to the CIB investigators,
that Lee continued to intrude into INSREA's core systems after the
companies ended the relationship last August, resulting in huge
losses for INSREA.

<P>
Outgoing Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san formally announced his candidacy Monday
for magistrate of the central Taiwan county of Taichung.
</P>
<P>
Chiu told a news conference that after careful consideration and
with encouragement from people in his home county, he decided to seek
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) nomination to run
in the year-end magistrate election.
</P>
<P>
As a Taichung County native, Chiu said he aspires to win the
magistrate post to accelerate the county's development in various
fields.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the central government has planned many ambitious
development projects for the county, including the central Taiwan
high-tech industrial park, the Taichung Harbor free trade port zone
and the Chingchuankang International Airport, Chiu said the
realization of these projects requires the close cooperation of the
Taichung County Government.
</P>
<P>
Taichung County has traditionally been a stronghold of the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and the People First
Party. Chiu said he hopes his magistrate candidacy will mark the
beginning of the county's administrative reform.
</P>
<P>
"I'll bring vision and hope to the county, one of the island's
most populous and spacious constituencies," Chiu said.
</P>
<P>
Chiu tendered his resignation from his current MAC post last
Friday. Premier Frank Hsieh has approved his resignation, which will
take effect April 2.

news conference to lend their support for Chiu's bid.
</P>
<P>
Former DPP Legislator Lin Feng-hsi has long made known his
resolve to seek the party's nomination to run for the county's top
administrative post.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said the DPP has a well-designed intra-party primary
mechanism to decide its candidate for the year-end election in each
constituency. "I'll compete with Lin strictly in line with our party
rules. Both of us will engage in a 'gentlemen's race.' Whoever wins
the candidacy will certainly have the best wishes and support from
the loser," Chiu said.
</P>
<P>
Chiu had been a prosecutor and a legislator before assuming his
current MAC post.
</P>
<P>
The post to be vacated by Chiu will be filled by You Ying-lung,
vice president of the Ketagalan Institute, an independent,
non-partisan educational institution founded by President Chen
Shui-bian in March 2003 to promote civic values through education,
policy research and public forums.
</P>
<P>
You, 49, an academic-turned-politician, had been DPP deputy
secretary-general and vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Research,
Development and Evaluation Commission before becoming Ketagalan
Institute vice president.

(FSC) made the remarks when he was reporting to the Finance Committee
at the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) raised

PRESIDENT CALLS FOR REVIEW OF TAX INCENTIVE SYSTEM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 21 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that
the government should establish an efficient incentive system to
encourage technological innovations and upgrade the nation's overall
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks after presiding over a meeting of the
presidential economic advisory group.
</P>
<P>
"The administration should inspire industrial upgrading based on
the principle of encouraging the creation of new values, " Chen said,
adding that by so doing, the nation's overall competitiveness can be
enhanced.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, Chen said, the existing tax incentive
mechanism should be subject to an overall review in order to ensure
that national resources are wisely and efficiently used.
</P>
<P>
"Academic institutes, government-funded research bodies and the
private sector should pool their resources in technological research
and development (R&amp;D) to enhance operational efficiency," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
In response to criticism that the government has offered too many
tax incentives for high-tech industries, Chen said the government may
have to set a timeframe or conditions for ending R&amp;D tax privileges,
commonly known as "sunset clauses, " to prevent abuse of the relevant
tax incentives.
</P>
<P>
Chen further said all new science-based industrial parks now
under construction should give priority to accommodating companies
devoted to production of high-end or high value-added products and
services.
</P>
<P>
"Invention and innovation will be core values for our
technological development, " Chen said, adding that he has directed
the Cabinet to come up with a comprehensive report on relaxation of
restrictions on high-tech development and investment.
</P>
<P>
The report will be unveiled at the presidential economic advisory
group's next meeting, Chen said.

U.S. MAINTAINS STANCE ON ANTI-SECESSION LAW: CABINET SPOKESMAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 21 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States has clearly expressed
its stance on China's Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan, and U.S.
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's visit to China has not moved
away from that position, a spokesman for the Executive Yuan said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Cho Jung-tai made the remarks when he was asked whether Rice
weakened the U.S. position on the newly passed law during her visit
to China.
</P>
<P>
Rice said in a press conference in Beijing earlier that day that
the U.S. hopes that both sides of the Taiwan Strait will not take
unilateral action to change the status quo or raise cross-strait
tension and that China will use peaceful means to resolve
cross-strait disputes.
</P>
<P>
Cho stressed that the U.S. State Department said March 14 that
the passage of the law was "unfortunate" and that "it really does not
serve the cause of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait."
</P>
<P>
Cho said that Rice's remarks in Beijing have not been any more
conservative or stronger that those expressed in the past.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. stance is clear, that Taiwan has also
clearly stated its position and that it now remains to be seen
whether or not the Beijing authorities understand this.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
also said Rice's remarks have not veered away from the basic U.S.
stance.
</P>
<P>
Michel Lu also said that the ministry appreciates Rice's remarks
that the legislation of the new law is "not a welcome development."

43.7% OF FOREIGN SPOUSES IN TAIPEI COUNTY NOWHERE TO CONTACT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 21 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly 44 percent of foreign spouses and
brides from China in Taipei County cannot be traced, Taipei county
government officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Over the past six months, an official said, the county government
has assigned contract staff to interview 47,191 foreign and Chinese
citizens who have been allowed to enter Taiwan and take residence in
the county by marriage.
</P>
<P>
"Much to our dismay, only slightly more than half of them could
be contacted smoothly, while up to 43.7 percent were nowhere to be
found, " the official said, adding that the county government is
worried about the whereabouts of those "missing" spouses.
</P>
<P>
Further probes found that 10,211 of the "missing" spouses did not
reside at their formally stated addresses, 6,933 had left Taiwan and
3,502 were divorced.
</P>
<P>
"We are worried that the missing spouses came to Taiwan through
marriages of convenience," the official said.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the county government has been
cooperating with police authorities in addressing the problem.
</P>
<P>
"It's like looking for a needle in a haystack to locate those
'missing' spouses," the official said.
</P>
<P>
With more and more local men tying the knot with Southeast Asian
women and women from China, about 340,000 foreign and Chinese spouses
have taken up residence in Taiwan. Among all counties and cities
around the island, Taipei County boasts the largest number of such
spouses.
</P>
<P>
Because of language barriers and different cultural backgrounds
and values, the official said, many of the women have had difficulty
adapting to the local lifestyle and need assistance.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey results, the official said, 55 percent of
the spouses interviewed said they most need assistance in landing
jobs, receiving vocational training and securing protection for their
work rights.
</P>
<P>
Many respondents also expressed keen interest in studying
Mandarin and Taiwanese, and some of them said they want to learn
about Taiwan's social welfare service regulations, get motorcycle
licenses and obtain information about the national health insurance
program.
</P>
<P>
The official said the county government has drawn up a
comprehensive educational and guidance program for these women,
including offering language courses at various elementary schools
around the county.

<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh will join the March 26
protest to show Taiwan's anger about Beijing 's enactment of its
Anti-Secession Law, Executive Yuan spokesman Cho Jung-tai said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Cho said the premier wants to express his solidarity with his
countrymen when the country is facing an unprecedented threat from
China.
</P>
<P>
He quoted Hsieh as saying that the protest will demonstrate to
the world Taiwan's determination to pursue peace and to defend
itself, and will show that Beijing's threat only helps the Taiwan
people to close their ranks even tighter.
</P>
<P>
The protest, organized by the so-called Alliance to Defend Taiwan
with Democracy and Peace, will also demonstrate to Beijing the
powerful will of the people, which would be smothered under an
authoritarian regime such as that of China, the premier was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Cho said the premier urges the public to join the protest, noting
that the more of them who show up March 26, the more international
publicity the protest will generate and the more the international
community will understand Beijing's threat to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
As a citizen of Taiwan, Cho quoted the premier as saying, he
cannot be absent from the protest when the world's major powers such
as the United States, Japan and the European Union are speaking out

The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) said Monday that it will lead 100,000 supporters in a March 26
protest called to vent the island's wrath with China's newly enacted
Anti-Secession Law.
</P>
<P>
The party said that in order to ensure a large turnout, its
Central Executive Committee asked party members and party officials
Monday to show up at the protest and to bring their followers with
them.
</P>
<P>
TSU Secretary-General Chen Chien-ming said the party has charted
a train March 26 to ferry its followers in northern Taiwan to the
Taipei City district of Wanhua, from where they will march toward
downtown Taipei.
</P>
<P>
TSU supporters in central and southern Taiwan will be brought to
Taipei on tour buses, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Although the protest is intended to show the people's opposition
to Beijing's Anti-Secession Law, Chen said his party will take
advantage of the event to press its demand to change the official
name of the country from Republic of China to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the TSU's so-called "spiritual leader, " former
President Lee Teng-hui, will deliver a speech to the demonstrators
when they converge in the square in front of the Presidential Office
at the end of the protest but will not join them on the march.

U.S. SENDS CLEAR MESSAGE OF OPPOSITION TO ANTI-SECESSION LAW: DPP
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 21 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States has sent a clear message
of its opposition to China's Anti-Secession Law, a legislative caucus
whip of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
William C.T. Lai was responding to U.S. Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice's remarks in Beijing earlier that day after
concluding her two-day visit there.
</P>
<P>
Rice said the passage of the Anti-Secession law, which authorizes
Beijing to adopt "non-peaceful means" against Taiwan should the
island move toward independence, makes it harder for the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait to engage in dialogue and that in the wake of the
passage of the law, the U.S. hopes China will take measures to
"demonstrate a willingness to reduce tension in the cross-strait
environment."
</P>
<P>
Lai noted that Rice expressed concern about the growth of
Beijing's military expenses and upgrading of its military might
during her visit to Japan and South Korea prior to her visit to
China. She also reaffirmed that the United States opposes either side
of the Taiwan Strait doing anything unilaterally to either try to
change the status quo or anything that increases the tension.
</P>
<P>
Lai also noted that the U.S. House of Representatives recently
passed a resolution 424-four to express grave concern over the
Anti-Secession Law and that U.S. State Department spokesman Richard
Boucher also said that the passage of the law is "unfortunate."
</P>
<P>
He said that as the United States, Japan and the European Union
have expressed concern over the law, the people of Taiwan should take
part in a protest march March 26 to show that the law has not only
affected the rights of the Taiwan people but has also affected the
peace and security of the Asia-Pacific region and that the
international community should intervene to protect regional
security.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chen Chieh, legislative caucus whip of the opposition
Kuomintang, said that Rice's visit will not necessarily solve the
cross-strait differences over the Anti-Secession Law and that an
easing of tension will depend on the wisdom of leaders across the
Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
An opposition People First Party (PFP) legislator said Rice's
remarks about Beijing taking measures to reduce cross-strait tension
are only a reaffirmation of Washington's long-standing position.
</P>
<P>
But Lee Yung-ping, the PFP caucus whip in the legislature, said
that the aspirations of the pro-Taiwan independence activists that
cross-strait tension will be raised and that the United States will
be forced to pressure Beijing "will fall through."
</P>
<P>
Chen Chien-ming, caucus whip of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity
Union in the legislature, said that Rice's remarks are so far the
strongest protest against China and he urged Washington to be more
active and to use a more substantive approach to support Taiwan's
democracy and freedom.

MND ACCENTUATES NEED TO PROCURE PATRIOT PAC III
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 21 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice Minister of National Defense Huo
Shou-yeh accentuated Monday the need for Taiwan to procure the
U.S.-made Patriot PAC III anti-missile system, saying if the
procurement plan is dropped, Taiwan will be unable to defend itself
from China's missile attacks.
</P>
<P>
Huo made the remarks while fielding questions from opposition
lawmakers at a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Defense Committee. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to persuade opposition lawmakers to support the
Ministry of National Defense's (MND's) long-stalled arms
procurement package, Huo said if the plan to purchase six Patriot
PAC III anti-missile batteries is killed, Taiwan will not have any
anti-missile capability in the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
According to an MND written report presented to the legislative
defense committee earlier in the day, Patriot PAC IIIs are the U.S.
military's latest anti-missile system in active service. They are
also the world's only batterfield-tested missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
Quoting data provided by the U.S. miltiary, the report said, the
chances of a Patriot PAC III interceptor hitting its target
reaches 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
During the 2003 Iraq War, the report said, the U.S. military
deployed Patriot PAC II and PAC III anti-missile batteries in the
batterfield. Iraq fired a total of 19 tactical missiles, with 10
falling in areas outside the Patriot's range and nine falling within
the range. All of the nine Iraqi missiles entering the Patriot
range were successfully intercepted, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to a Pentagon report released in September 2004, the
Patriot PAC III has completed batterfield tests and been
deployed. In test-firings conducted in March, September and
November 2004, the Patriot PAC III interceptors all could directly
hit the incoming targets.
</P>
<P>
The MND report further said if its plan to purchase six Patriot
PAC III batteries can clear the legislature smoothly, 70 percent of
Taiwan's population and more than 60 percent of its industrial
production facilities will be under the theater missile defense
system's protection.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report said the United States has offered a
cheaper price for the Patriot PAC III batteries to be sold
to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
As the U.S. military has agreed to deduct the research and
development cost from the Patriot PAC III price to be offered to
Taiwan, the report said, each interceptor will carry a price tag
of about US$3.01 million, lower than the US$3.2 million price offered
to the Netherlands and Japan.
</P>
<P>
In the face of China's ever mounting missile threat, the MND
report said Taiwan badly needs to purchase the Patriot anti-missile
defense system.
</P>
<P>
"As China has pointed hundreds of tactical missiles at Taiwan, we
urgently need to purchase anti-missile defense system to safeguard
our national security," the report said.
</P>
<P>
At present, the report said, the military's anti-missile system
can only protect northern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Patriot PAC III anti-missile batteries can be
flexibly deployed and fired by a remote-controlled system, the report
said the planned procurement of six Patriot PAC IIIs is aimed at
beefing up the nation's anti-missile defense capabilities.
</P>
<P>
"Once we acquire the new anti-missile defense system, we'll be
able to protect major cities in northern, central and southern parts
of the island as well as major strategic locations from China's
missile attacks," the report said, adding that the new batteries are
expected to offer protection for 70 percent of local population and
more than 60 percent of industrial production facilities.
</P>
<P>
The six Patriot PAC III anti-missile batteries are part of a
package of advanced weapons Taiwan intends to buy from the UNited
States. The package also includes eight diesel-electric submarines
and a squadron of 12 Orion P-3C anti-submarine aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet already approved the MND's proposal to mark down the
budget ceiling for the procurement package from the original NT$610.8
billion to NT$480 billion (US$15.48 billion) after a plan to build
the submarines in Taiwan was dropped and the new Taiwan dollar has
appreciated against the U.S. currency in recent months.
</P>
<P>
The revised procurement proposal will soon be referred to the
opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan for screening and approval.
The MND report about the Patriot PAC III's performance and price tag
was part of the ministry's efforts to seek legislative support for
the bill.
</P>
<P>
The arms procurement package has been stalled for a long time.
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislative caucus
urged the opposition camp Sunday to stop boycotting the package for
the sake of national interests.

BEIJING INTENDS TO USE NON-PEACEFUL MEANS AGAINST TAIWAN: MAC
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   March  21  (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The recent enactment of China's
Anti-Secession Law shows that Beijing intends to use non-peaceful
means to solve the cross-Taiwan Strait dispute, the Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a news release, Taiwan's top China policy formulating agency
explained that the law describes abstract and ambiguous situations
under which the Beijing authorities are allowed to resort to
non-peaceful means against Taiwan, which is tantamount to a "blank
check" for attack.
</P>
<P>
The move has triggered serious concern from the international
community because it threatens the peace and stability of the East
Asian region, the council went on.
</P>
<P>
The MAC also expressed appreciation for the United States, Japan,
the European Union, Canada, Australia and many other countries for
their open opposition to the law.
</P>
<P>
According to the People's Daily newspaper in China, Article 8 of
the Anti- Secession Law states: "If the Taiwan independence
secessionist forces should act under any name or by any means to
cause the fact of Taiwan's secession from China, or that major
incidents entailing Taiwan's secession from China should occur, or
that possibilities for a peaceful reunification should be exhausted,
the state shall employ non-peaceful means and other necessary
measures to protect China's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
The State Council and the Central Military Commission shall decide on
and execute the non-peaceful means and other necessary measures and
report to the National People's Congress Standing Committee."

humble in his estimate of himself as compared with other men. Such a
man, whether he be in public life or in private life, will be a
distinguished man."

Manila Bulletin: Holy
Tuesday means repentance

Holy Tuesday is a day in the Holy Week that opens
the high road for repentance, and a return to God.
Today, devotees will find altars in Catholic churches
almost bare, with crosses and sacred images draped in
purple fabric to symbolize the imminent desertion by
two of Jesus' trusted apostles: Simon Peter, out of
fear, and Judas Iscariot, out of greed.

The Philippine Daily Inquirer: SPECIAL SESSION
CALLED, Arroyo rushes VAT approval 

DESPITE warnings that lawmakers are unlikely to
cut short their Easter break, President Gloria
Macapagal-Arroyo has called for a three-day special
session after the Holy Week because every week of
delay in the value-added tax (VAT) reforms is costing
the government P1.25 billion in foregone revenues.

CANADA OPPOSES ANTI-SECESSION LAW

<TEXT>
<P>
Canada has expressed clearly its
opposition to China's recently passed Anti-Secession Law targeting
Taiwan, Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Pierre Pettigrew said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Pettigrew made the remarks while responding to questions by Don
Boudria, a member of the Canadian Parliament who heads the
Canada-Taiwan Parliamentary Friendship Group, during a
question-and-answer session in the House of Commons.
</P>
<P>
Pettigrew reaffirmed that Canada is very concerned about the
passage of the Anti-Secession Law, which authorizes "non-peaceful
means" against Taiwan should the island move toward
formal independence. China's rubber-stamp parliament, the National
People's Congress, passed the law March 14.
</P>
<P>
Canada is especially concerned about the "non-peaceful means"
which it fears will lead to tensions in Taiwan and Southeast Asia,
the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Canada has unequivocally told the Chinese embassy in
Ottawa and Beijing officials that Canada is opposed to the new law,
and is opposed to either side of the Taiwan Strait taking unilateral
actions, including the use of force, to change the status quo in the
strait.

PREMIER TO PLACE FAMILY ASSETS INTO BLIND TRUST
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 22 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Tuesday he will
put his family assets into a blind trust to accentuate the
government's sincerity and resolve in promoting clean politics.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the pledge during a Legislative Yuan interpellation
session where opposition Kuomintang Legislator Wang Yu-ting asked the
premier whether the government is sincere about establishing clean
politics and stamping out official corruption.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
administration has been committed to substantiating clean politics,
Hsieh said he is willing to set an example for other politicians to
follow by putting his family assets into a blind trust.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said he has been discussing his asset trust plan with a
professional accountant.
</P>
<P>
"A final deal on entrusting my family assets to professional
managers can be struck soon," Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
He further said the DPP administration will push for the
establishment of an independent anti-corruption agency in the future
to substantiate the goals of various "sunshine bills, " which have
been enacted in the past few years, such as the Political
Contribution Law, to prevent corruption and promote clean politics
and transparency.
</P>
<P>
The government will also refer to practices adopted by foreign
countries to revise existing laws and legislate new ones to
facilitate probes into cases involving government employees suspected
of acquiring assets illegally during their terms of office.
</P>
<P>
Current Taiwan laws do not require senior officials to put their
assets into a blind trust. But President Chen Shui-bian entrusted his
family assets to professional managers shortly after he won a second
presidential term last May.

TWO KMT CHAIRMAN ASPIRANTS AT LOGGERHEADS OVER MEMBERSHIP FEES ISSUE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 22 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two opposition Kuomintang vice chairmen
who are vying for the party's top post are still at loggerheads over
whether to allow KMT members who have not paid membership fees to
vote in the party chairmanship election, and the issue may have to be
resolved through a vote at a KMT Central Standing Committee meeting
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who is in favor of only allowing those
who have paid their membership fees to vote in the election scheduled
for July 16, said that it is simply "unreasonable" to have two
different sets of rules for elections for party posts and elections
for government posts.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that if those who have not paid their membership fees are
allowed to vote in a party election while only those who have paid
the fees are allowed to vote in elections for government positions,
then the electorate for these two types of elections will be
different and the election results "distorted."
</P>
<P>
A more reasonable approach would be to allow party members to
make up for any unpaid fees, Ma said, adding that the amount can be
discussed further. He said the figure should not exceed NT$900
(about US$28).
</P>
<P>
The other aspirant for the KMT chairmanship, Legislative Yuan
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, also pointed out that the makeup of voters for
party elections and elections for government positions are different
because of the different rules regarding membership fees.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that at present, about 700,000 of the some 1 million
KMT members are unwilling to pay membership fees, which he said
demonstrates that they have "deviated from the party." If these
members are allowed to vote, it will bring them back into the party
fold, he said.
</P>
<P>
On media reports that the other KMT vice chairmen favor only
allowing those who have paid their membership fees to vote in the
chairmanship election, Wang said that they are voicing their "own
opinions" and that the issue will be decided in a vote during the KMT 
Central Standing Committee in its regular meeting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The disagreement on the membership issue, a seemly trivial
question that suddenly props up because of two strong contenders have
entered the race instead of the one-man election in the past, between
Ma and Wang can also be witnessed between their respective
supporters.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Lai Shyh-bao, who supports Ma, said that if those who
have not paid their membership fees are allowed to vote, then the
precedent could be applied to the KMT primaries in the city and
county elections, which he said would have a tremendous impact on the
party system, adding that the KMT must therefore "think about it
carefully."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Legislator Ho Tsai-feng, who supports Wang, said that
the Wang camp is confident that a vote on the issue in the KMT
Central Standing Committee meeting will be in favor of allowing those
who have not paid their membership fees to vote in the party
chairmanship election.

TAIWANESE IN SAN FRANCISCO, CANADA TO RALLY AGAINST BEIJING LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
San Francisco,  March 21 (CNA)
(By Chiang Chun, S.K. Wu and Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An action committee representing
the overseas Taiwanese community in San Francisco urged Taiwan
expatriates Monday to participate in a rally March 26 in front of the
Chinese consulate general to protest Beijing's enactment of its
Anti-Secession Law aimed at Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The action committee called on Republic of China nationals,
regardless of their political affiliations or ethnicity, to take part
in the protest to safeguard Taiwan's security, which it said has come
under greater military threat from China due to the adoption of the
law which provides a legal basis to deal with Taiwan through
"non-peaceful means."
</P>
<P>
It also issued a statement objecting to the law and stressing
that other countries have no right to decide Taiwan's fate. Only the
23 million people of Taiwan are entitled to determine the country's
future course, and Beijing must be cognizant of this fact and respect
the will of the Taiwan people, it said.
</P>
<P>
Accusing Beijing of plotting to deny the ROC's sovereignty and to
unilaterally alter the status quo in the Taiwan Strait with the law,
the action committee said that the scheme has violated the U.N.
Charter, undermined the international order and raised tensions in
the region.
</P>
<P>
The law is tantamount to writing a blank check for Beijing to
launch an attack against Taiwan at any time, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The "ill-intentioned" law not only poses a huge threat to peace
and stability in the Taiwan Strait and the rest of East Asia, it also
abuses the rights and free will of the Taiwan people, the committee
said, adding that a strong protest must be lodged to condemn
Beijing's actions.
</P>
<P>
It called on all overseas ROC nationals and the international
community to back the Taiwan people's democracy and freedom.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, various Taiwanese organizations in eastern Canada are
slated to stage a rally March 24 in Ottawa to protest the
Anti-Secession Law enacted by Beijing March 14. Participants will
gather on Parliament Hill before marching to the People's Republic of
China Embassy to voice their protest. Several members of the Canadian
Parliament are also expected to speak at the rally.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Compatriots Association in Ottawa said that the
People's Republic of China, since its founding in 1949, has never for
one day ruled Taiwan, and that the ROC is an independent and
sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
With its "fabricated" one China policy and more than 700 missiles
targeting Taiwan, Beijing poses a serious threat to the livelihood of
the 23 million people of Taiwan, the association said.

ROC FOREIGN MINISTRY WELCOMES RICE'S COMMENTS ON ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's
recent comments in Beijing about the unhelpfulness of the
Anti-Secession Law was a welcome development, Ministry of Foreign
Affairs spokesman Michel Lu said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lu made the comments at a news conference at the ministry's
headquarters in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
According to Lu, Rice's talks in Beijing fully reflect the
interests and values commonly shared and upheld by Taiwan and the
U.S. Rice also reiterated that the U.S. hopes that democracy, peace
and prosperity in the Taiwan Strait and the rest of the Asia-Pacific
region is maintained.
</P>
<P>
Rice said Monday during her two-day visit to Beijing that
Beijing's adoption of its Anti-Secession Law aimed at Taiwan is not
welcome and unhelpful to delicate cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
"The Anti-Secession Law was not a welcome development because
anything that is unilateral that increases tensions, which clearly,
the Anti-Secession Law did increase tensions, is not good," Rice said
following meetings with mainland Chinese President Hu Jintao, Premier
Wen Jiabao and Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing.
</P>
<P>
"I did talk to my Chinese counterparts about hopefully taking
measures in the wake of this Anti-Secession Law, taking measures that
would demonstrate a willingness to reduce tensions in the
cross-strait environment, " Rice told reporters. "We are not pleased
when either side does anything unilaterally to either try to change
the status quo or that increases tensions."
</P>
<P>
Rice paid her first visit as Secretary of State to Beijing after
mainland China's National People's Congress overwhelmingly approved
the law March 14 to fend off Taiwan independence through non-peaceful
means, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has never denounced the use of force against Taiwan
despite the fact that the two sides of the strait split in the wake
of a civil war in 1949. Taiwan and the mainland have been under
separate governments since that time.

The Times: Camilla will be Queen unless
MPs change law.

Camilla Parker Bowles will become Queen unless Parliament
legislates to strip her of the right to the title, it was confirmed
yesterday. The admission by the Department for Constitutional Affairs
contradicts repeated assertions by Clarence House that she will be
known only as Princess Consort on her husband's succession, and not
Queen. Any change to her status may also have to be approved by the
17 parliaments in countries where the new King will be head of state.
However, that runs the risk that some countries, such as Australia,
Canada and New Zealand, may vote instead to become republics because
they could not accept a"Queen Camilla".

Financial Times: Brown fears new pact could stop UK joining euro.

Gordon Brown indicated yesterday that the UK may face a new
obstacle to euro entry, after EU finance ministers agreed on sweeping
plans to rewrite its Stability and Growth Pact. As governments
digested the implications of a new set of EU fiscal rules agreed at
the weekend, the chancellor said he had ensured that a new
medium-term deficit target would only apply to the 12 states within
the eurozone, not those, like the UK, outside the euro. But speaking
on his return from a Brussels summit of EU finance ministers, Mr
Brown indicated that the new target - under which members must keep
borrowing below 1 percent of national income over the medium term -
would make it even harder for a Labour government to join the euro
whilst retaining key domestic policy objectives.

NATIONAL ASSEMBLY CANDIDACY REGISTRATION TO START MARCH 26
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 22 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Central Election Commission (CEC)
announced Tuesday it will begin to accept candidacy registration for
the May 14 National Assembly election this weekend.
</P>
<P>
Only political parties or private alliances composed of more than
20 members are eligible to register their individual candidates with
the CEC because seats in the nation's first-ever and probably last
mission-oriented National Assembly will be allotted to political
parties or groups in proportion to the ballots they garner in the
upcoming popular vote.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Assembly election rules, political
parties or groups must deposit NT$100,000 in guaranty for each
candidate they intend to nominate while registering their candidacy
with the CEC. The money will not be refunded if the parties or groups
fail to obtain a specified minimum number of votes in the election.
</P>
<P>
The candidacy registration will start at 8 a.m. March 26 and last
through 5: 30 p.m. March 30, CEC Deputy Secretary-General Teng
Tien-you said, adding that the daily work hours are from 8 a.m. to
noon and from 1:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
Candidates for the National Assembly seats must not be younger
than 23. Election staff, military personnel in active service,
conscripts on alternative services and cadets at military academies
are banned from running in the election. But according to the newly
revised Public Officials Election and Recall Law, students at
civilian educational institutions and policemen will be eligible to
vie for the National Assembly seats.
</P>
<P>
Teng said political parties or alliances must fill out candidacy
application forms and produce their lists of individual candidates as
well as other relevant documents and articles, including the
candidates' mug shots and agreements to serve as a specific party's
representatives in the National Assembly, while registering with the
CEC at its headquarters in downtown Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Registration forms can be downloaded from the CEC's Web
site at www.cec.gov.tw, Teng added.
</P>
<P>
The mission-oriented National Assembly will be tasked to screen a
package of constitutional amendments passed by the Legislative Yuan
last August, including changing the legislative electoral system to a
"single seat, two ballots" system and phasing out the National
Assembly to allow for holding a referendum on future constitutional
amemdment proposals.

KMT VICE CHAIRMAN TO VISIT CHINA IN LATE MARCH

<TEXT>
<P>
Kuomintang (KMT) Vice Chairman P. K.
Chiang is slated to visit mainland China later this month in an
effort to help forge rapport in cross-Taiwan Strait ties, a spokesman
for the main opposition party said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chiang will visit China from March 28 to April 1 at the head of a
KMT delegation, but his itinerary has yet to be decided, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
KMT Chairman Lien Chan announced in late February that Chiang
would travel to China this month and pay tribute at the mausoleum of
Republic of China founding father Sun Yat-sen in Nanjing and at the
tomb of the 72 martyrs who sacrificed their lives in a KMT-led
revolution against China's last empire, the Ching Dynasty, in
Guangzhou, southern Guangdong province.
</P>
<P>
The death of the 72 martyrs on March 29, 1911 is designated as
the ROC's national Youth Day.
</P>
<P>
Chiang's trip will come after a large demonstration set for March
26 in Taipei by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party in
conjunction with its pro-Taiwan independence ally, Taiwan Solidarity
Union, to protest the Anti-Secession Law adopted March 14 by Beijing
with an eye to warding off Taiwan independence.

<P>
In the face of a new surge in oil prices
on the global market that are expected to push up consumer prices at
home, Premier Frank Hsieh pledged Tuesday not to "rashly" raise water
and electricity rates during his term.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the promise while fielding questions from opposition
Kuomintang Legislator Wang Yu-ting during a question and answer
session at the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The premier admitted that rate increases have been in the works
for some time, but he pointed out that he favors a proposal to
temporarily freeze any hikes in public utility fares "if bank
interest rates and workers' salary increases do not pick up."
</P>
<P>
However, he claimed that he cannot promise that water and power
rates will stay fixed during his term due to international factors
and added that users' rights and interests will be fully taken into
account before the government makes a final decision.

MILITARY ASKED TO REVIEW NAVY FLEET'S FLOP IN SINGAPORE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 22 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Tuesday there is
still room for the Ministry of National Defense to improve its visit
arrangement for the ROC Navy's "Fleet of Friendship" after the team
was recently barred from making a port call in Singapore due to
pressure from China.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh told lawmakers during a legislative interpellation session
that the ministry should have anticipated the many problems that were
likely to occur when the fleet was to visit a country with no
diplomatic relations with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Without a definite commitment from the destination country, it
would have been better for the fleet to avoid the country in the
first place, Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
A local daily reported Tuesday that because of pressure from
Beijing, Singapore decided without prior notice to prohibit the fleet
from berthing when the vessels arrived at the city-state for
refueling early this month. Singapore is the first stop on the
itinerary of the fleet's round-the-world cruise this year.
</P>
<P>
The fleet was later allowed to anchor offshore, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
Minister of National Defense Lee Jye said Taiwan and Singapore
had a secret agreement to allow a port call by the fleet but a media
leak of the arrangement put Singapore under heavy pressure.
</P>
<P>
Lee promised no similar incidents would occur during the rest of
the fleet's voyage because all the remaining destinations are
diplomatic allies of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen noted that Singapore is
very mindful of China's reaction, which he said is evident in the
remarks made by Singapore's national leaders, including Prime
Minister Lee Hsien Loong.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has relayed the
government's position on the matter to Singapore through diplomatic
means.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, foreign ministry spokesman Michel Lu said the ministry
will continue its efforts to expand the country's participation in
the international community despite Beijing's continued suppression.

STATUTE FOR ARMS PROCUREMENT FAILS TO REACH AGENDA AT LEGISLATURE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 22 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Cabinet-proposed "statute for major arms
procurement" failed to be put on the agenda for review at the
Legislative Yuan Tuesday because of the opposition from the majority 
"pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First
Party (PFP).
</P>
<P>
The KMT and the PFP caucuses of the legislature said that there
are still disputes over the arms procurement proposal, and that the
Cabinet should not list the arms procurement package for six Patriot
PAC-III anti-missile batteries, eight diesel-electric submarines and
a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft from the United States
under a special budget.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time the statute was blocked since the Cabinet
marked down the ceiling price for the procurement package from the
original NT$610.8 billion to NT$480 billion (US$15.38 billion)
because a plan to make the submarines in Taiwan was dropped, and
because the new Taiwan dollar has appreciated against the U.S.
dollar.
</P>
<P>
During the discussions, KMT Legislator Shuai Hua-ming proposed
that the arms procurement proposal be postponed from being put
on the agenda, and his words led to verbal sparring among the ruling
and the opposition legislators.
</P>
<P>
Legislator William C. D. Lai, caucus whip of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party in the legislature, said that as long as
the prepared information is complete, all bills should be put on the
agenda.
</P>
<P>
Lai also took the chance to criticize KMT and PFP legislators for
themselves proposing "money-pit" bills.
</P>
<P>
Lee Yung-ping, PFP caucus whip in the legislature, said that most
of the KMT and the PFP legislators were opposed to the arms
procurement during the legislative elections late last year. Judging
from the fact that the "pan-blue alliance" legislators won over half
the seats in the 225-member legislature, the public is opposed to
paying an exorbitant price for the major arms purchase and opposed to
the listing the purchase under a special budget, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet proposed a similar bill last year, but it,
together with a proposed special budget for the procurement, was
shelved by the legislature owing to objections from the majority
"pan-blue alliance."
</P>
<P>
After the proposed statute and budget were killed at the end of
the last legislative term in January this year, the Cabinet had to
re-submit them in the new legislature that started Feb. 1.

HEALTH PREMIUM TO BE RAISED APRIL 1 FOR SELECT GROUPS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 22 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Health insurance premiums for government
employees, public school teachers, military personnel and those in
high-income brackets will be raised by varying amounts next month,
the Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Starting from April 1, the ceiling on the index health insurance
premium will be raised to NT$131,700 from the current NT$87,600.
</P>
<P>
As a result, each high-income wage earner will have to pay an
additional health insurance premium per month of NT$61 to NT$602.
</P>
<P>
"Some 300,000 high-income wage earners will be affected by this
measure," said Hung Pi-lan, head of the DOH's task force in charge of
health insurance premium adjustments.
</P>
<P>
After the adjustments, the gap between the highest and lowest
index insurance premiums will be widened to 8.3 times, conforming to
the social justice principle of wealthier people paying more to
bolster the universal health insurance program.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hung said, the insured amount of the nation's 760,000
government employees, teachers and military personnel will also be
raised from the current 82.42 percent of their monthly salary to
87.04 percent from April.
</P>
<P>
"The ratio adjustment means that each public functionary, teacher
or military serviceman will pay an additional NT$61 to NT$307 per
month," Hung said.
</P>
<P>
The two adjustments will affect some one million people in the
system while helping increase the health insurance premium revenues
by NT$3.5 billion annually, Hung said.
</P>
<P>
According to Hung, the adjustments are part of the DOH's efforts
to prevent the cash-strapped national health insurance program from
going bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
Hung said the DOH's Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI)
has worked out other proposals aimed at keeping the insurance program
afloat, including raising the taxes on cigarettes and liquors,
funneling air pollution fines into the BNHI coffers and implementing
a number of austerity programs to cut medical and health care costs.

SECOND FINANCIAL REFORM TO BRING TAIWAN IN LINE WITH THE WORLD: CHEN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 22 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan is undergoing a second financial
reform to open the country's financial markets completely to the
outside world, President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Receiving a group of executives from insurance companies from
across Asia, Chen said the second financial reform will bring the
island's insurance practices in line with those of developed
countries and will make it easier for foreign insurance operators to
venture into local markets.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that Taiwan has great potential and is keeping in step
with globalization, pointing to the fact that 17 out of the 57
insurance companies operating in Taiwan are from overseas, and that
the insurance sector's combined assets accounted for 16 percent of
the country's financial industry as a whole in 2004.
</P>
<P>
The president said the insurance sector's total premiums income
accounted for 14 percent of the country's gross national product in
2004, ranking it 15th in the world and fourth in Asia, adding that
this income is growing by 10 percent to 12 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the country has been gradually opening its markets to
international players since its entry into the World Trade
Organization in 2002 and this second financial reform being
engineered by his administration is part of a program to integrate
the island's markets with global markets.

Republic of China Vice President
Annette Lu toured the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Florida
Monday on the second day of her transit stop on her way back to
Taipei after a Central America diplomatic tour that took her to El
Salvador and Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
Lu received a warm welcome from the center's Chinese-descent
director, Dr. Jiann-Gwo Jiing, when she arrived together with her
152-member entourage.

</P>
<P>
Jiing briefed Lu and her entourage on the center's functions and
its various facilities for observing, forecasting and analyzing
hurricanes to facilitate activation of the disaster prevention
mechanism.

</P>
<P>
Later in the day, Lu visited Florida International University,
where she attended a tea part hosted by the school's president, Dr.
Modesto A. Maidique, in her honor. Lu said she hopes the school will
increase exchanges with Taiwan's academic and educational
institutions.
</P>
<P>
She also toured Fort Lauderdale. In the company of Fort
Lauderdale Mayor Jim Naugle, Lu toured the city's new landmark
building River House to see for herself Fort Lauderdale's new urban
development projects. She also took an amusement ride aboard a
Taiwan-made "water taxi" along the city's scenic river.
</P>
<P>
In the evening, Lu dined with Taiwan expatriates living in the
Florida area. Speaking on the occasion, Lu said she hopes Taiwan
people at home and abroad can work hand-in-hand to realize the
nation's bid to join the Organization of American States as an
observer.
</P>
<P>
Touching on China's recent enactment of its Anti-Secession Law
targeting Taiwan, Lu said Beijing's ill-intentioned legislation has
made the international community understand that it is China that is
the troublemaker in the Taiwan Strait, not Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan is by no means a troublemaker. Instead, we are a
peacemaker. We love peace, freedom and democracy. Over the past more
than five decades, we have lived under China' military threat and
diplomatic isolation. But we have not been daunted. We have
successfully developed Taiwan into one of Asia's most prosperous and
vibrant democracies," Lu said, adding that she thinks Taiwan deserves
a Nobel peace prize.
</P>
<P>
Before her departure for home, Lu will visit a Jewish senior
citizens' nursing center, attend a tea party to be hosted by Coral
Gables City Mayor Don Slesnick and visit the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
After her official visits to El Salvador and Guatemala, Lu
arrived in Miami Sunday to a warm welcome from William Brown, acting
chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan, and ROC Representative
to the United States David Ta-wei Lee.

PREMIER STICKS TO CROSS-STRAIT 'CO-EXISTENCE AND RECONCILIATION'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 22 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China has damaged Taiwan's security by
enacting the Anti-Secession Law and Taiwan should respond duly,
although the response should be appropriate lest the two sides become
forever anathematic to each other, Premier Frank Hsieh said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the remarks during a general interpellation
session at the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Hung Hsiu-chu of the opposition Kuomintang asked Hsieh
if he still sticks to his ideas on cross-strait "co-existence and
reconciliation" after China's rubber-stamp parliament, the National
People's Congress, passed an Anti-Secession Law on March 14,
authorizing "non-peaceful means" against Taiwan should the island
move toward formal independence.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that in the long term, both sides have to
"co-exist." Geographically, Taiwan is close to the mainland, and
instead of whining about being near a rogue neighbor, it is better to
think in terms of the advantages of being near the mainland, as
Taiwan will be able to influence its democratization.
</P>
<P>
He also reaffirmed his new mindset for Taiwan, saying that Taiwan
cannot be marginalized as China rises, and that as both sides of the
Taiwan Strait become even closer economically, Taiwan cannot sit on
the sidelines and must grow stronger by riding on the coattails of
the economic boom on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan shouldn't consider itself a pariah, Hsieh said, adding
that both sides must co-exist and prosper together.
</P>
<P>
The premier also reaffirmed that he will take part in a planned
march this Saturday to protest Beijing's newly passed law.
</P>
<P>
The march is being sponsored by a civic group, the Alliance to
Defend Taiwan with Democracy and Peace, which he said is significant
in the sense that it will galvanize the people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said that he took many things into consideration before
deciding to take part in the march, adding that he will also
encourage civil servants to join the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
As for whether President Chen Shui-bian should take part in the
march, he said that he will leave that for the president to decide,
although he said the president will have to take other things into
consideration, such as international relations and the future ties
with China.

FEBRUARY JOBLESS RATE UP TO 4.28 PERCENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 22 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's jobless rate was 4.28 percent in
February, up 0.22 percentage points from the previous month,
according to statistics released Tuesday by the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).
</P>
<P>
DGBAS officials said February's figure represents the first rise
in nearly six months. They attributed the reasons mainly to the
increase of those who quit their jobs to look for new ones after
the Chinese New Year holiday, and the end of temporary jobs offered by
the government's public service expansion program. 
</P>
<P>
The officials said that the number of the employed was 9.87
million in February, while the number of the jobless in the same
month was 441,000, up 22,000 from the previous month. Among the
22,000, the number of those who lost their jobs because of the
closure or the scaling down at the work place and the end of
temporary jobs offered by the government under a job-creation project
increased by 14,000, while the number of those who quit their jobs
because of dissatisfaction with their work increased by 6,000.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the economic growth this year was slower than the
previous year. The number of the jobless in the construction sector
in February increased by 18,000 from the previous month alone,
contributing to the rise in the jobless rate in February.
</P>
<P>
The jobless rate of those between 45 and 64 was 3.22 percent, up
0.32 percentage points from the previous month. Whether this was
related to a new pension system for laborers, which will be put
into practice in July this year and which will affect those laborers
who have worked long years, the officials said that they will still
have to look at the figures in March and April to make a more
accurate assessment.

TAIWAN STUDYING FURTHER ACTION AGAINST ANTI-SECESSION LAW: OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
New York,  March 21 (CNA)
(By Weng Tsui-ping and Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei's representative office in the
United States is consulting with foreign countries about the
possibility of taking further action against Beijing's Anti-Secession
Law targeting Taiwan after the United Nations failed to make any move
on the matter, a Taiwan official based in New York said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Andrew L. Y. Hsia, director of the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Office in New York, said the situation is due to the fact that Taiwan
is not a member of the United Nations, whose decisions, however, can
affect the island.
</P>
<P>
For example, the implementation of the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora and
the Kyoto Protocol aimed at cutting back on greenhouse gas emissions
have subject certain Taiwan exports to international trade sanctions,
Hsia pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Hsia made the remarks while receiving a group of 34
undergraduates from Taiwan, who are scheduled to attend a simulated
U.N. meeting to be held Tuesday in New York.
</P>
<P>
Asserting that it is Taiwan's basic right to join the United
Nations, Hsia said because Taiwan is not a member of the world
organization, the people of Taiwan are not able to be involved in the
international community and the international community also dares
not accept donations from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He said the enactment of the Anti-Secession Law, which authorizes
the use of non-peaceful means against Taiwan should the island move
towards independence, is another example that has highlighted the
island's need to join the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Usually, the U.N. Security Council will meet immediately for a
resolution and ask concerned parties to sit down for peace talks in
the event of a country enacting a law to pave the way for an invasion
of another country, but the United Nations has done nothing in this
case so far, Hsia noted.
</P>
<P>
He said China will create unnecessary regional tensions by
changing the cross-Taiwan Strait status quo unilaterally through the
law.
</P>
<P>
After Japan, the European Union and Canada have stated their
opposition to the enactment of the law, Taiwan will continue to make
its case to the international community to try to win more
international support, he said.

PEOPLE AROUND TAIWAN SUMMONED TO 326 PROTEST MARCH
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 22 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Facing China's reinforced threat with the
passage of its Anti-Secession Law, young people, women and children
around Taiwan were urged Tuesday to attend a protest march slated for
March 26 in Taipei.

</P>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party's department of women's
affairs, along with several private women's organizations, initiated
Tuesday a "Mammies, Babies Loving Peace, Protecting Taiwan" campaign,
while kicking off a recruiting drive for 706 children aged between
three and six who will symbolically bare their buttocks to Beijing
and its Anti-Secession Law in the planned march.
</P>
<P>
The children will have their buttocks pasted with "anti-missile"
posters on March 26, while pregnant women are also wanted for the
campaign aimed at "voicing Taiwan's love for peace with sounds of
tenderness" during the demonstration, Hsu Chia-chin, director of the
department, said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Besides the women's action, taxi drivers were also urged to voice
their support for the "anti-Anti Secession Law" drive organized by
the "Alliance to Protect Taiwan with Democracy and Peace, " which
carried out a publicity stunt Tuesday by arranging hundreds of yellow
cabs to form the word "peace" in front of Taipei County Hall.
</P>
<P>
The alliance chief executive Lee Yi-yang also pasted "326 March"
stickers on the taxis. Lee said the cars are mobile broadcasting
stations that could summon more people to take to the streets March
26.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Taichung City, a group of students and young people
in the central Taiwan area were planning a trip to Taipei for the
March 26 protest by a so-called "magic train of democracy" with the
support of former Government Information Office Director-General Lin
Chia-lung.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference to promote the train trip, Lin, who has been
named to serve as "train master" for the trip, noted that China's
enactment of the Anti-Secession Law is a big threat to Taiwan and
said all the people on the island, regardless of their political
links, should stand out to fight against the attempt to annex Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The train will be painted in colors supposed to show themes
adopted from the popular "Harry Potter" series of novels by J.K.
Rowling, according to the organizers, who did not explain the
significance of this.
</P>
<P>
The "magic train" is scheduled to set off at 9: 40 a.m. March 26
from the Taichung Railway Station for Taipei, and will return later
that day, the organizers said, adding that about 800 people are
expected to board the train.

<P>
The Ministry of Education is scheduled to
hold a conference March 23-24 in central Taiwan to seek measures to
improve the education of children from international marriages,
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Although the learning ability of these students differs little
from that of other children, their learning efficiency may differ
owing to their parents' socio-economic background, according to the
officials.
</P>
<P>
The conference will bring together educators that will share
their teaching experience and discuss problems they face in teaching
children born to a foreign mother or father, they said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will also hold a similar conference in northern
Taiwan in May.
</P>
<P>
According to ministry statistics, a total of 47,196 elementary
and junior high school students around Taiwan were born to a foreign
parent in the 2004-2005 academic year, with 41,591 in elementary
schools and 5,605 in junior high schools.
</P>
<P>
The top three localities where these students are attending
school are Taipei County, Taoyuan County and Taipei City.
</P>
<P>
On the nationalities of the foreign parents, those from China,
Hong Kong and Macau total 16,034, with 11,687 from an Indonesian
mother or father and 5,289 with a Vietnamese parent.

million) in the first two months of this year, with accumulated
profits amounting to NT$72 million.

The company currently has 52 shipbuilding orders in hand, which
is expected to keep its production lines busy up to early 2009, he

CHINA KNOWS BETTER THAN TO BOYCOTT TAIWAN: PREMIER

<TEXT>
<P>
China knows better than to apply economic
sanctions against Taiwan, as it would also hurt itself, Premier Frank
Hsieh claimed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Fielding an opposition lawmaker's question about how his
administration would respond to Beijing's economic sanctions against
Taiwan, which is one of the non-peaceful options threatened by
Beijing after passing its Anti-Secession Law, the premier said that
neither side of the Taiwan Strait will benefit in such a senario,
although he admitted that Taiwan "might suffer more" as it enjoys a
huge trade surplus with China.
</P>
<P>
China and Taiwan will flourish if they can live peacefully
alongside each other and cooperate, Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
In order to prevent China from resorting to sanctions that would
be harmful to both sides, the premier said his administration is
working with major powers to limit China's leeway in using
non-peaceful means against Taiwan. He did not elaborate.

The Ministry of Finance announced Tuesday
that it had lifted an anti-dumping tax on Japanese H-beams with
immediate effect.
</P>
<P>
Tsan Kuang-ruey, deputy director-general of the Department of
Customs Administration under the Ministry of Finance (MOF), said that
the government decided to lift the punitive tax following a series of
investigations by the MOF and the Ministry of Economic Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The investigations found that imports of Japanese H-beams would
not damage the domestic steel industry's development.

ACADEMIA CALLS FOR CONTINUITY OF NATIONAL SCIENCE COUNCIL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 22 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Forty-four members of Academia Sinica, led
by Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh, urged the Executive Yuan
Tuesday to enlarge the National Science Council (NSC) into a full
ministry instead of eliminating it as envisioned in the Executive
Yuan's reorganization plan.
</P>
<P>
In a public letter to the Executive Yuan, the scholars said the
country's intelligentsia has aired its opposition to the proposal to
eliminate the NSC, but has elicited no reply from the Executive Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Expressing regret that their opinions have been overlooked, the
letter says its signatories are uneasy with the government's plan to
do away with the NSC, which has contributed a great deal to the
country's science and technology development and has played a
significant role in producing the "Taiwan miracle, " referring to the
country's amazing economic development.
</P>
<P>
Eliminating the NSC and transferring its business to other
government agencies is certain to damage the country's scientific
research because the absence of an agency exclusively charged with
the development of science will blunt Taiwan's competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Instead of abolishing it, the NSC, which can only coordinate
science-related policies among various government ministries for the
time being, should be enlarged into a ministry with the authority to
map out, execute and supervise the country's science policy, the
letter says.
</P>
<P>
The country's intelligentsia will be disappointed and the
government's goal of sharpening the country's competitiveness will be
hampered if the NSC is abolished, the letter warns.

<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan will not let up on its effort to
join the World Health Assembly despite a Beijing official's assertion
that China will make every attempt to block it, Health Minister Hou
Sheng-mou said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a response to Beijing Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing's statement
that it is impossible for Taiwan to join the WHA as an observer this
year, Hou said it is regrettable that China hurts the feelings of
Taiwan people by subordinating their health to Chinese political
interest.
</P>
<P>
However, Taiwan's efforts to join the WHA will not abate. Rather,
it will aggressively join international rescue operations sponsored
by the World Health Organization, of which the WHA is the assembly,
and scrupulously follow the World Health Regulations crafted by the
WHO.
</P>
<P>
Hou said Taiwan's participation in the international rescue
operation in the wake of the disaster caused by the Dec. 26 tsunami
in South Asia and Southeast Asia last year has won the country an
international reputation for generosity that will be helpful for
Taiwan's WHA bids.

TAIWAN A STRATEGIC PARTNER OF DEMOCRATIC WORLD: ROC ENVOY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
London, March 22 (CNA)
(By N.K. Han and Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan has always been a strategic partner
of the democratic world, the new Republic of China representative to
Britain said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Edgar Lin said that as Taiwan's strategic position is of major
significance in terms of global peace and security, the United States
is determined to defend this part of the world. He added that Japan
also firmly believes that Taiwan's security is inextricably linked to
Japan's security and that of other neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Lin made the remarks while addressing a welcome party held in his
honor by the British-Taiwanese All-Party Parliamentary Group.
</P>
<P>
Lin, who assumed his current post only two months ago, said that
Beijing's recently enacted Anti-Secession Law, which authorizes the
"use of non-peaceful means" against the island in certain situations,
has not only deprived the 23 million people of Taiwan of their
autonomous rights, it also threatens peace and security in East Asia
and will eventually result in a "conflict of civilizations between
the West and the East."
</P>
<P>
This "ill-intentioned" law, if coupled with a lifting of the
European Union ban on arms sales to China, which the union has been
considering for the last several months, will undoubtedly accelerate
China's military expansion, posing a huge threat to many countries in
the world, Lin warned.
</P>
<P>
The new ROC envoy expressed his appreciation to the British
parliamentarians for their support for Taiwan and his admiration for
their far-reaching vision on cross-Taiwan Strait issues.
</P>
<P>
Lin also said that he was extremely pleased to hear British
Secretary of Foreign Affairs Jack Straw on Monday voice his
opposition to a lifting of the European Union's arms embargo against
China.
</P>
<P>
He further said that Taiwan has been a sovereign, independent
country for over the past five decades and that it is not a part of
the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
There is no such thing as the so-called "Taiwan issue, " he
claimed, adding that there is only a "China issue" since China
insists on maintaining the option of force to annex Taiwan, which he
said has caused cross-strait tensions to continue to escalate.
</P>
<P>
Lin added that he has noticed that the British government has
recently reiterated its stance that Taiwan's future should be
resolved peacefully through dialogue, which he said he fully
supports.
</P>
<P>
Formerly chairman of the Cabinet-level Environmental Protection
Administration and a Republic of China ambassador to Gambia, Lin
quoted a Chinese foreign affairs expert as saying recently that if
China were to fail to secure Taiwan, it would never become a great
maritime power. This indicates the Chinese military's ambitions
regarding Taiwan, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the best option to prevent cross-strait conflicts
from erupting is to speed up the democratization of Hong Kong and the
Chinese mainland, with democratic Taiwan working in concert with
Western countries to maintain peace and security in East Asia and the
rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Speaking prior to Lin's speech, Lord Richard Faulkner of
Worcester, vice chairman of the British-Taiwanese All-Party
Parliamentary Group, said at the cocktail party that his group will
continue to strongly voice support for Taiwan's bid to join the World
Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
Faulkner criticized the European Union for considering lifting
its arms embargo against China before Beijing improves its human
rights record, referring to it as "scandalous" and saying no
responsible government should do that sort of thing.

JAPAN'S CONCERN OVER TAIWAN INCREASINGLY EXPLICIT: ROC ENVOY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 23 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Japan's concern over Taiwan in terms of
security as a result of Beijing's enactment of its Anti-Secession Law
has become increasingly explicit, the Republic of China
representative to Japan said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Koh Se-kai said Japan's stance on the cross-Taiwan Strait issue
has become clearer as the country increasingly feels the threat posed
by China in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan Foreign Affairs
Committee, Koh noted that the Japanese government has expressed its
intention to "demonstrate grave concern" and "conduct a possible
intervention" in the event of incidents that may undermine
cross-strait peace.
</P>
<P>
Koh said Japan is not legally allowed to organize its own
military forces prior to its amending of Article 9 of its
Constitution. But if cross-strait conflict erupts after the Japanese
Constitution is amended, it will positively demonstrate its serious
concern toward such conflict, Koh added.
</P>
<P>
Should cross-strait conflict occur prior to the Japanese
constitutional amendment, Koh said, Japan can only throw its support,
such as logistic support, behind the U.S. military in the event that
the United States comes to Taiwan's rescue militarily should a
cross-strait war erupt.
</P>
<P>
Discounting criticism by opposition Kuomintang Legislator Su Chi,
who claimed that Taiwan's diplomacy toward Japan is nothing but
"kowtow, independence and senility" diplomacy, Koh said he has done
his utmost in efforts to maintain Taiwan's dignity while securing
engagement with Japan.
</P>
<P>
Koh promised to look further into the issue that Taiwan's trade
deficit with Japan soared by 50 percent to reach US$56.83 billion
last year, saying that he will see to it that certain measures are
adjusted.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that he is pro-Taiwan independence and that the
establishment of a "Republic of Taiwan" is his personal ideal, Koh
said that as a government functionary, his priority is to fulfill his
governmental obligations.
</P>
<P>
"I know what I'm doing," Koh responded to opposition People First
Party Legislator Sun Ta-chian, adding that he agrees with Sun that
the best common ground for Taiwan for the time being is maintaining
the Republic of China and securing the cross-strait status quo.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Koh said, Japan will continue to support Taiwan in its
bid to participate in the World Health Assembly (WHA) , the
decision-making body of the World Health Organization, this year,
marking the third consecutive year that Japan has openly thrown its
support behind Taiwan in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government has promised that "what has been achieved
will not be degraded," Koh said, adding that his office will continue
to push for Japanese officials to voice support for Taiwan at the
WHA.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, a number of ROC health officials are
scheduled to visit Japan in April to enhance Taiwan's WHA lobby.
</P>
<P>
Also at the Legislative Yuan Foreign Affairs Committee session,
Koh said that Taiwan has been invited to take part in the Japanese
expo, Expo 2005 Aichi.
</P>
<P>
On display at the Aichi Expo will mainly be Taiwan delicacies and
snacks, as well as unique Taiwan agricultural products, Koh added.
</P>
<P>
Sidelining the expo, several Taiwan performance groups, including
the Cloud Gate Theatre and the Lanyang Dance Troupe, will stage five
days of performances and concerts in June and July, he said.

PRESIDENT TO DECIDE WHETHER TO TAKE PART IN MARCH THURSDAY
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March  23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian will decide
Thursday whether to take part in a protest march scheduled for this
Saturday, ruling Democratic Progressive Party Chairman Su Tseng-chang
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Su made the remarks when he unveiled the so-called "spiritual
bastion" of the march -- a white pearl inscribed with the word
"peace" to symbolize Taiwan and a red ovoid spiked ball representing
China -- at the National Taiwan University Alumni Hall.
</P>
<P>
Su said the 20-meter high beacon will be placed on Ketagalan
Boulevard in front of the Presidential Office, which will be the
destination of Saturday's march, to underscore the marchers' anger
over China's Anti-Secession Law.
</P>
<P>
Likening the red ball to a sea urchin, Su said every spike on the
ball represents Chinese missiles that will sabotage peace and makes
other countries uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
He also sent out text massages via computer to party officials
and the media, urging them to mobilize more people to take part in
the protest rally.
</P>
<P>
Su and other officials then deflated balloons representing
Chinese missiles to demonstrate Taiwan's determination to pursue
peace.

P-3C AIRCRAFT TO BOOST MILITARY'S UNDERSEA SURVEILLANCE SCOPE: MND
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 23 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The procurement of 12 P-3C anti-submarine
aircraft from the United States will meet the military's minimum
combat demand and expand its undersea surveillance scope by more than
10-fold, according to a report presented Wednesday to the legislature
by the Ministry of National Defense.
</P>
<P>
While seven of the planes are expected to be delivered to Taiwan
in 2009, the other five will be delivered in 2011, the report says.
</P>
<P>
It says the ministry originally reserved NT$53.04 billion (US$1.7
billion) in a special budget proposal for the 12 aircraft, but the
amount has recently been adjusted to NT$45.04 billion following
changes in the exchange rate and cutbacks in spending and coverage of
some of the amount by the government's regular budget.
</P>
<P>
It points out that the military's existing S-2T anti-submarine
planes, which have been in service for more than 40 years, are no
longer capable of meeting the military's combat demands and that the
military needs to replace the planes to enhance its three-dimensional
anti-submarine capabilities.
</P>
<P>
China has in recent years developed the Song-class submarine and
nuclear-powered submarines and has also purchased Kilo-class
submarines from Russia, the report notes.
</P>
<P>
In the event of a Chinese blockade of Taiwan, the nation's
economy and security will be seriously jeopardized, it says.
</P>
<P>
Lin Chin-ching, head of the ministry's Integrated Assessment
Office, predicted that China will have the ability to build aircraft
carriers in 2008 and to form an aircraft carrier battle group in 2015
to gain sea dominance in the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Also in 2015, the submarines developed by China will be equipped
with the ability to launch an undersea blockade, attack and nuclear
retaliation, Lin added.
</P>
<P>
Lin said the number of new frigates owned by the Chinese navy and
its combat capabilities will significantly surpass those of Taiwan in
2012, which he said will pose a great challenge.
</P>
<P>
The 12 P-3C aircraft are one of the items in the government's
NT$480 billion proposed arms procurement package from the United
States. Also on the shopping list are six Patriot PAC-III
anti-missile batteries and eight diesel-electric submarines.

TAIWAN STUDENTS TAKING PART IN U.N. SIMULATION CONFERENCE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
New York, March 22 (CNA)
(By T.P. Weng and Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A total of 34 Taiwan students are taking
part in the 2005 National Model United Nations (NMUN) Conference that
opened at the U.N. headquarters Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The students, led by Chiang Chia-hsiung, an associate professor
at National Chengchi University, attended the opening ceremony of the
2005 NMUN Conference, marking the second time that Taiwan college
students have entered the U.N. building after the Republic of China
lost its seat in the world body to China more than 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The NMUN Conference, the world's largest university-level
simulation of the United Nations, is being held under the auspices of
the National Collegiate Conference Association.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony, Dr. Michael Ignatieff from
Harvard University quoted U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan as
espousing recently that the U.N. Security Council should be enlarged
in scale to help facilitate U.N. reforms.
</P>
<P>
The inefficient U.N. Human Rights Committee, which has been
dominated by undemocratic, totalitarian countries, should also be
reorganized into a U.N. Human Rights Council to allow reform-minded
and genuine human rights-championing countries to participate,
Ignatieff said.
</P>
<P>
Ignatieff called for the world to help poor countries, saying
that about 2 billion people go to bed hungry every night with a per
capita daily income of less than US$1.
</P>
<P>
It is shameful that Americans spent US$35 billion on pets last
year, an amount larger than the United States spent on aid to poor
countries that year, he added.
</P>
<P>
Ignatieff welcomed the 3,000-odd students from around the world
to the conference, saying that they are bringing new hope to the
United Nations. It is hoped that in some five or 10 years, some of
the students will represent their countries at the United Nations and
achieve the tasks that the current generation has failed to achieve,
tasks that include arms controls and limits on execution of force.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan students will take part in debate sessions with 18 out
of 24 U.N. committees over three days. They are also expected to take
part in the closing ceremony of the conference slated for March 26.

TAIWAN URGED TO ENHANCE INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC RELATIONS

<P>
Former American Institute in Taiwan
(AIT) Chairman Natale Bellocchi said Tuesday that Taiwan's
achievement in democratization is its best vehicle for winning
international support.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a symposium on the impact of Beijing's enactment of
the Anti-Secession Law, Bellocchi said Taiwan should bolster its
public relations work in the international community and should
refrain from what he described as "clinging to the United States for
everything."
</P>
<P>
The United States is too busy to render comprehensive help to
Taiwan, the former AIT chairman and managing director said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's democratization is the most efficient weapon to deter
China's guns and missiles, and also the best bargaining chip in
efforts to win sympathy and support from the world, according to the
former official.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has been doing a good job in terms of lobbying in the
United States, but the problem is that America is too busy with
fighting terrorism at home, the Iraq issue and the new efforts to
push for democracy in the Middle East to enable it to help Taiwan
fully, Bellocchi said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Taiwan should direct its energy from lobbying in
the United States to addressing the international community, in order
to allow more countries to understand Taiwan's democracy, which will
show in sharp contrast to China's totalitarianism.
</P>
<P>
The symposium was organized by the Formosan Association of Public

Premier Frank Hsieh encouraged public
servants Wednesday to take part in a March 26 protest in Taipei
against Beijing's Anti-Secession Law, but stressed that the
government will maintain neutrality in the activity, Executive Yuan
spokesman Cho Jung-tai said after a weekly Cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to Cho, Hsieh urged public functionaries to participate
in the protest but made it clear that the government will not
obligate them to do so.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that public servants are part of Taiwan society
and that everyone in Taiwan should show their solidarity to the world
at a time when the country's peace and democracy are under increased
threats, Cho added.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh himself will take part in the protest.
</P>
<P>
William C. D. Lai, a legislative whip of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), was optimistic about keen public response to
the rally.
</P>
<P>
Basing his optimism on survey results, he estimated that more
than 2 million people will take part in the demonstration, higher
than the DPP's original target of 1 million.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Lin Cho-hsui said high ranking government
officials should not take part.
</P>
<P>
Saying that the government should craft an adequate policy to
deal with the situation rather than take to the streets, Lin said
that the government should not get involved in the demonstration in
order to make sure that it remains an activity purely for the public
to express their anger about the law.
</P>
<P>
He suggested the government set up a task force to study
countermeasures to the law through legal means.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Legislator Su Chi of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT),
said he supports participation by KMT backers, but voiced his
opposition to the DPP's strategy of using public mandate as a pretext
to help break the stalemate facing President Chen Shui-bian after
Beijing enacted the law March 14 with an eye to quelling Taiwan
independence.
</P>
<P>
Su claimed that the real purpose behind the demonstration is to
find a way out of the deadlock for Chen.
</P>
<P>
Su, formerly a chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council in the previous KMT-led government, made the comments while
giving a report at a weekly Central Standing Committee meeting of the

Legislator William Lai estimated Wednesday that more than 2 million
people will join the March 26 protest to show their anger against
Beijing's enactment of the Anti-Secession Law.
</P>
<P>
Lai, who is the secretary of the DPP caucus at the Legislative
Yuan, predicted that Taipei -- the venue for the protest -- will be
bursting at the seams March 26 with so many protesters flocking to
the capital to take part.
</P>
<P>
Citing his own experience as an example, Lai said the DPP asked
him to solicit at least 1,000 protesters from his home city of
Tainan, and promised to provide him with 20 buses to ferry them to
Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Lai said he ran commercials on a Tainan radio station and gave
out leaflets to seek protesters, eliciting a response so overwhelming
that the number of people asking to join the protest surpasses his
1,000 quota by far, so that many of them will have to travel on buses
assigned to other DPP lawmakers in Tainan.
</P>
<P>
According to a poll conducted by the DPP, Lai said, 15 percent of
those interviewed said they will join the protest and 11 percent said
they will not miss it for anything, which means that about 2 million
people can be expected to take to the streets.

The production value of Taiwan's printed
circuit boards (PCBs) amounted to NT$167.8 billion (US$5.36 billion)
in 2004, according to a report released Wednesday by the Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics.
</P>
<P>
The figure represents a rise of 13.8 percent from 2003, a
four-year high, the report says.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan exported PCBs worth NT$133.7 billion in 2004, 44 percent
of which went to China and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
China has replaced the United States to become the major export
market for Taiwan's PCBs since 2002 owing to increased demand in
China and Taiwan's liberalization policy that allows notebook
computer manufacturers to establish operations in China, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Taiwan imported PCBs worth NT$18.6 billion in 2004.

IRRELEVANT WHETHER PRESIDENT TAKES PART IN 326 MARCH: SCHOLAR

<P>
Whether President Chen Shui-bian
should take part in a March 26 protest to express anger over China's
recent enactment of its Anti-Secession Law is beside the point, a
U.S. China expert said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
John Tkacik, a research fellow in China Policy at the Heritage
Foundation, made the remarks in a seminar sponsored by the pro-Taiwan
independence Formosan Association for Public Affairs in Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
According to Tkacik, Beijing has "irrationally" enacted the
Anti-Secession Law and Taiwan has no need to counter it by adopting
an anti-annexation law, making irrational moves to even the score, or
by mobilizing a government-led protest march.
</P>
<P>
But if it were the private sector mobilizing a 1-million protest
march on its own, it would underscore the will of the Taiwan people
to the international community.
</P>
<P>
Bonnie Glaser, another China hand who is currently a senior
associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies,
noted that according to media reports Chen will not march but will
deliver a speech when the participants reach the end at Ketagalan
Boulevard in front of the Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that Chen has been seeking an appropriate way to
respond to Beijing's newly passed law -- which authorizes
"non-peaceful means" against Taiwan should the island move toward
formal independence -- without further raising cross-strait tension.
His speech, should he deliver it, will be a major indication of
whether he will stick to that course, she added.

EXPORT ORDERS DOWN SLIGHTLY TO US$16.19 BILLION IN FEBRUARY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Export orders were down slightly to
US$16.19 billion in February due to decreased working days because of
the weeklong Chinese New Year holiday, the Statistics Department of
the Ministry of the Economic Affairs said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The figure represents an annual increase of 7.68 percent,
officials said. Export orders amounted to US$34.61 billion in the
first two months of this year, or an increase of 19.47 percent from
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Among the major export items, the increase of electronics
products by US$320 million in February from the same month last year
contributed the most to an increase in export orders, mainly because
of continuing strong foreign demand for consumer electronics.
</P>
<P>
Electronics products were followed by export orders for
information and communications products, which increased by US$160
million from the same month last year, and by export orders for
precision instruments, which increased by US$140 million from the
same month last year.
</P>
<P>
The officials estimated that export orders will grow steadily,
and should show an increase of around 10 percent in March.

<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan-based China Airlines (CAL) recently
won an award of excellence from Air Cargo World, a U.S.-based
magazine. It was the first time CAL had won the award.
</P>
<P>
In an Air Cargo World survey, CAL was ranked second best among 50
international carriers in terms of air cargo transportation services,
following Virgin Atlantic Airlines of the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Survey respondents were asked to evaluate each company by rating
four areas: customer service, performance, value and information
technology, according to a CAL official.
</P>
<P>
In the terms of customer service, carriers were graded on their
ability to handle claims with expedience and solve problems in a
prompt and courteous manner. In performance, the ability to fulfill
promises and contractual agreements and to meet scheduled transit
times were considered.
</P>
<P>
Value examined competitive fees, rates commensurate with service
levels required by customers, and value-added programs. Information
technology was defined as the ability to track and trace shipments,
and Internet and electronic commerce abilities, the CAL official
said.
</P>
<P>
CAL owns the world's largest B747-400F all-cargo fleet with 16
planes, according to the company.

ANTI-SECESSION LAW MAY BE HELPFUL TO TAIWAN: U. S. SCHOLAR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington  D.  C.,  March  22  (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing's passage of the
controversial Anti-Secession Law might be a good thing for Taiwan, as
it has explicitly exposed Beijing's plot to swallow Taiwan, a
political analyst said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar sponsored by the Taiwan
independence-leaning Formosan Association for Public Affairs, John J.
Tkacik, Jr., a senior researcher at the Heritage Foundation, claimed
that the law regarding Taiwan has shown Beijing's true colors to the
entire world.
</P>
<P>
Saying that Beijing should feel ashamed because of the limited
backing for the law from just a few countries such as North Korea,
Russia and Zimbabwe, Tkacik pointed out that the decision of the
European Union to postpone lifting its arms exports ban on mainland
China is another side effect of the law.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, a measured response from Taiwan should
help gain greater international support for the island, he contended.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, remarks made recently by U. S. Secretary of
State Condoleezza Rice in Beijing also reflect Washington's
discontentment with the law.
</P>
<P>
Rice said Monday following meetings with Chinese President Hu
Jintao, Premier Wen Jiabao and Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing that the
Anti-Secession Law is neither welcome nor helpful to thawing ties
between Taiwan and China.
</P>
<P>
She urged Beijing to "take measures that would demonstrate a
willingness to reduce tensions in the cross-strait environment, " and
reiterated the position of the U. S. to help defend Taiwan in
compliance with the Taiwan Relations Act.
</P>
<P>
Tkacik called the Anti-Secession Law a "war-mandating bill, "
which he said will accelerate insecurity in East Asia and totally
disqualify Beijing from acquiring advanced weapons under the terms
provided by the E.U.
</P>
<P>
Under E.U. rules, its member states are not allowed to sell
weapons to countries that pose a threat in an adjacent region or
those notorious for their lack of good human rights records, he said,
adding that China fails both tests.
</P>
<P>
The National People's Congress, Beijing's ceremonial parliament,
approved the Anti-Secession Law March 14 to stem moves toward Taiwan
independence through non-peaceful means, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
In response, Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party is
organizing a large protest on March 26 to allow the people in Taiwan
to show Beijing their outrage. More than one million people are
expected to take to the streets in Taipei this Saturday.

HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP URGES BEIJING TO ANNUL ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>

Berlin,  March 23 (CNA)
(By Lin Yu-li and Huang Kwang-chun)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Frankfurt-based International Society
for Human Rights (ISHR) has urged China to unconditionally rescind
its recently enacted Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In an open letter signed by ISHR Chairman Karl Hafen March 21,
the organization described the law as a "war-authorizing bill"
against Taiwan and called on European nations not to overlook
Beijing's military intimidation and threat.
</P>
<P>
Beijing authorities have continuously oppressed dissidents,
minorities and religious believers and have carried out the world's
most executions, it noted, adding that Beijing's claim that the
Anti-Secession Law is aimed at pursuing peaceful reunification of
Taiwan and China is not credible.
</P>
<P>
All countries around the world should ask China in the United
Nations to quash the controversial law, it went on.
</P>
<P>
The open letter also urged the European Union to abandon its plan
to lift its arms embargo against China.
</P>
<P>
It said that whether or not Taiwan and China unite, and if so
when and how, is a matter that must be decided by the people of
Taiwan, who have enjoyed freedom and the protection of human rights.
</P>
<P>
China's rubber-stamp parliament, the National People's Congress,
approved the law March 14, authorizing the Beijing authorities to use
"non-peaceful means" against Taiwan should the island move toward
independence.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1972, the ISHR is an international non-governmental
organization that bases its work on the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights proclaimed by the United Nations on Dec. 10, 1948.
</P>
<P>
It seeks to promote international understanding and tolerance in
all areas of culture and society and acts according to the philosophy
that the realization of human rights and the improvement of social
conditions cannot be pursued by the use of force.

JAPAN COULD SUPPORT U.S. IN FIGHT FOR TAIWAN: REP TO JAPAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 23 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Japan is forbidden by its constitution
from having an army or navy and is thereby incapable of engaging in a
war; however, it could extend logistical support to the United States
should the U.S. go to war over Taiwan, Republic of China's
representative to Japan said in Taipei Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Koh Se-kai told the Legislative Yuan that Japan has been
reluctant to take sides in the confrontation between the United
States and China over the Taiwan issue because it needs Chinese
support in its bid to join the United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
But Tokyo has shed its reluctance since the end of last year by
airing its concerns over Taiwan's security more assertively because
of its realization that China is a potential threat to the region,
Koh said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan was relieved when Japan said in February that the peaceful
solution of the Taiwan issue is a strategic objective shared by it
and the United States, Koh said.
</P>
<P>
Although Japan has extended visa-free privileges to Taiwan
tourists during the period of its Expo 2005 Aichi, Taiwan's five top
leaders, namely the president, vice president, premier, defense
minister and foreign minister have yet to receive approval from Tokyo
to visit Japan, Koh said.
</P>
<P>
Also exempt from the visa-free program are 48 senior government
officials and the first lady, Wu Shu-jen, who will have to give
Japanese authorities 10 days' advance notice before visiting, Koh
explained.
</P>
<P>
Koh said he didn't think there would be any problem for the first
lady to visit Expo 2005 Aichi, if she wishes.
</P>
<P>
He made the comments in response to a recent report that Wu was
interested in visiting Expo 2005 Aichi, but was worried that her
visit might cause embarrassment to the host country.

U.S. WANT TAIWAN TO COMMIT ON ANTI-SUBMARINE AIRCRAFT BY MAY 1
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 23 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States has asked Taiwan to
decide before May whether it intends to buy 12 U.S.-made P-3C
anti-submarine aircraft, an Naval official told the Legislative
Yuan Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Navy General Staff Vice Admiral Lee Hai-tung said the U.S.
might withdraw its offer to sell the planes if Taiwan fails to commit
to the deal before May 1.
</P>
<P>
He said he did not agree with an opposition lawmaker's sarcastic
claim that Taiwan is America's watchdog in the Taiwan Strait, but he
admitted that Taiwan would share with the United States information
gathered by its anti-submarine aircraft.
</P>
<P>
In a briefing to the legislature, Lee said the 12 P-3Cs offered
by the United States are the same model currently in use by the U.S.
and would therefore make exchanging information on the planes with
the U.S. easy.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the 12 P-3Cs are the minimum Taiwan requires to shield
itself from underwater attacks, and after being retrofitted, they
would replace the country's aging anti-submarine fleet of 26 S-2Ts.
They may also be used in combination with forces on and beneath the
water to expand the current area patrolled by a factor of 10.
</P>
<P>
Given the fact that P-3Cs are in service in at least 16 countries
around the world, the U.S. is eager to know whether Taiwan will
accept its offer as orders from other countries are piling up, Lee
claimed.
</P>
<P>
The P-3Cs are part of a proposed arms purchase from the U.S. The
package was originally budgeted at NT$610.8 billion (US$18.23
billion) , but is now being considered at NT$480 billion due to
currency changes and a decision not to build submarines included in
the deal in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The budget for the purchase has been stuck in the legislature
because of opposition parties who think that the weapons are
overpriced and will not approve the deal.

ACCOMPANYING LAWS EXPECTED TO STEP UP CHINA'S THREAT TO TAIWAN: MAC
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 23 (CNA)

<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing is expected to enact ancillary
laws and refine its Anti-Secession Law to intensify its intimidation
of Taiwan, according to a report submitted by the Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) to the legislature Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
MAC Chairman Joseph Wu will outline the report Thursday at the
Legislative Yuan on the government's countermeasures to tackle the
latest development across the Taiwan Strait after Beijing's enactment
of the law last week.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that Beijing has been using a "carrot and stick"
approach to cross-strait affairs while turning a blind eye to
Taiwan's opposition, Wu said in the report that Beijing is likely to
continue promoting interactions in an effort to create a friendly
image and diminish criticisms from the international community.
</P>
<P>
The report goes on to say that the Chinese foreign ministry has
been trying to gain international backing for the Anti-Secession Law
by sending ranking officials for visits abroad and maintaining close
links with Chinese-language media around the world.
</P>
<P>
Beijing is expected to introduce complementary laws, such as
"emergency state decrees" or a "military mobilization law" to further
cement its legal basis to define its "one China" principle and the
status quo in the strait in terms of sovereignty disputes with
Taiwan, the report says.
</P>
<P>
To protect Taiwan's overall interests and national security in
cases of irrational actions by Beijing, the MAC will comprehensively
assess ensuing complications of the Anti-Secession Law as a gauge of
how to conduct cross-strait exchanges, despite the fact that peace
and development remain the two central themes in government policy
regarding China.
</P>
<P>
The People's National Congress, China's parliament, approved the
Anti-Secession Law March 14 in view of a mounting pro-independence
movement in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Although President Chen Shui-bian has repeatedly claimed that he
will not declare Taiwan independence during his term, Beijing remains
highly wary of an independence-minded Chen.

TAIWAN'S INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION DECREASES IN FEBRUARY

Taiwan's industrial production index stood
at 103.41 for February, down 13.26 percent from the previous year's
level and down 17.3 percent month-to-month, according to statistics
released Wednesday by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA).
</P>
<P>
The decrease brought the country's accumulated industrial output
in the first two months to a negative annual growth of 1.45 percent,
Chang Yaw-tzong, director of the MOEA statistics department said.
</P>
<P>
Chang also expressed his concern that industrial production may
suffer another setback in March given that international oil prices
continue to surge and global economic growth is slowing.
</P>
<P>
The appreciation of Taiwan's currency against the U.S. dollar and
the number of working days in February being less than the previous
year due to the weeklong Chinese New Year holiday were other factors
attributing to the decrease, he went on.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's industrial output index posted 124.75 for January, an
annual expansion of 13 percent but a 4.65 percent fall from the
December 2004 level.

TAIWAN MOVES UP TWO NOTCHES IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY REPORT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 23 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan has moved up two notches in the
Global Information Technology Report compiled by the World Economic
Forum and releaded earlier this month in Geneva, an official said in
Taipei Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Minister without Portfolio Lin Ferng-ching said the 2004-2005
report, which assesses the network readiness of 104 economies around
the world, placed Taiwan 15th, comparing to 17th last year.
</P>
<P>
The Networked Readiness Index prepared by the report measures the
degree of preparation of a nation or community to participate in and
benefit from information and communication technology (ICT).
</P>
<P>
The index is composed of three component indexes which assess the
environment for ICT offered by a given country or community; the
readiness of the community's key stakeholders; and the usage of ICT
among these stakeholders.
</P>
<P>
Lin said Taiwan moved up from 17th the previous year to fourth
this year in terms of readiness, from 22nd the previous year to 11th
this year in terms of usage, but dropped from eighth place last year
to 23rd this year in terms of environment.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the drop in the ranking of environment on the poor
scores Taiwan got in the effectiveness of law, the independence of
its judiciary, and the protection of intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
However, Lin said the country's move up in the overall ranking
indicates that the government's programs to promote the development
and use of information technology is beginning to bear fruit.

Today is Thursday, March 24, or the 15th
day of the second month of the Year of the Rooster according to the
lunar calendar. Following is a list of important events that have
occurred on this date in the past:

1401: Tamerlane, or Tamburlaine, the Mongolian ruler who led his
hordes from their capital of Samarkand in central Asia to overrun
vast areas of Persia, Turkey, Russia and India, conquers Damascus.

1603: Elizabeth I, Queen of England and Ireland who succeeded the
Catholic Mary I and reestablished Protestantism in England, dies at
the age of 70. Her reign was marked by the execution of Mary Queen of
Scots, the defeat of the Spanish Armada, and domestic prosperity and
literary achievement.

1783: Spain recognizes the independence of the United States.

1882: Robert Koch, the German bacteriologist who discovered the
cholera bacillus and the bacterial cause of anthrax, announces the
isolation of tuberculosis germs. He later won a 1905 Nobel Prize for
developing tuberculin.

1839: Ching Dynasty Commissioner Lin Tse-hsu closes down 13

President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday
that Taiwan expects China to use rational, democratic and peaceful
methods, not "non-peaceful means," in its rise as a regional power.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks at the annual congress of the Association

Noting that China's quick rise has led to both expectations and
concerns in the international community, Chen said he is worried
about failure by Beijing to recognize that an attempt to use
"non-peaceful means" to deal with relations across the Taiwan Strait
could cause cross-strait tension and regional instability.
</P>

In his view, Chen went on, peace and democracy are the best cure
for autocracy and military force. "We look forward to China's early

PRESIDENT TO JOIN MARCH 26 RALLY AGAINST CHINA'S ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   March  24  (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian announced
Thursday his decision to take part in a large-scale rally set for
March 26 against China's Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
However, Chen said he will not give any speech or play the
leading role in the rally.
</P>
<P>
"I can't and won't be absent on March 26 and will take my whole
family to participate in this sacred moment of history, walking and
standing by the Taiwan people," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
"I'll shout together with everybody to the other side of the
Taiwan Strait that 'we want democracy, we love peace,'" he added.
</P>
<P>
The president made the announcement when meeting representatives
of the Taiwan Democratic Alliance for Peace, a ruling Democratic
Progressive Party-led group that is organizing the rally.
</P>
<P>
The group has set the goal of attracting at least one million
people to participate in the "326 March for Democracy and Peace"
event.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he has heard the outrage and resentment of the people
toward Beijing's wilful decision to enact the Anti-Secession Law,
which authorizes the use of "non-peaceful means" against Taiwan in
certain situations, disregarding the objections of the vast majority
of the people in Taiwan and widespread condemnation from the
international community.
</P>
<P>
The people on this island know very well that Taiwan's
achievements in terms of democratic and economic development are
likely to be destroyed by such undemocratic and non-peaceful means
adopted by China, Chen noted.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that more than two million Taiwan people held their
hands on Feb. 28 last year to form "the Great Wall of Taiwan
democracy" and exhibit to the world the collective resolve of the
Taiwan people against China's missile threat.
</P>
<P>
"Two days from now, one million Taiwan people will take to the
streets in the most rational, democratic and humble manner to again
express the true voice of Taiwan for 'democracy, peace and
security,'" he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, one million people will say in one voice to
China and to the world that the passage of the Anti-Secession Law has
damaged the peaceful status quo across the strait, posed a serious
threat to the universal values of freedom, democracy and human
rights, and marked the regression of human civilization.
</P>
<P>
The president said he is convinced that democracy and peace are
not only the best remedy for dictatorship and force but also the most
powerful asset Taiwan has to win international support.
</P>
<P>
"Eventually, the 1.3 billion people in mainland China will stand
on the side of democracy and peace," Chen predicted.

GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TO KEEP LOW PROFILE IN MARCH 26 RALLY: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>

(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ranking government officials will be
"in the second line" in the large protest Saturday in Taipei against
Beijing's Anti-Secession Law, Premier Frank Hsieh said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said that government officials will not be "in the
frontline" and will not give any speeches. The move is to play down
the government's role in the demonstration initiated by a private
organization, he added.
</P>
<P>
The premier called on government functionaries to actively take
part in the rally and urged the public not to criticize those who
don't participate in it. In a democracy, all sorts of opinions are
acceptable, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh himself will participate in the protest. President Chen
Shui-bian announced earlier the same day that he will take part in
the demonstration along with his family, but will not deliver any
speech on the occasion.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party said it is optimistic
that more than one million people from across Taiwan will take part
in Saturday's rally in Taipei to express their opposition to
Beijing's recent passage of the law, which authorizes the use of
"non-peaceful means" against Taiwan should the island move toward
independence.
</P>
<P>
Despite President Chen's reiteration that he will not change the
official title of the Republic of China and will not declare Taiwan
independence during his term, Beijing remains highly wary of a what
it sees as an independence-minded Chen.

VARIOUS FACTORS USED TO ASSESS RESUMPTION OF CROSS-STRAIT EXCHANGES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 24 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges could return
to normal after several events take place, with the election of the
representatives for the mission-oriented National Assembly on May 14
being just one of them, the nation's top China policy planner said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Wu, chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC), made the remarks while answering questions by Legislator John
Chiang of the opposition Kuomintang at the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Chiang claimed that Wu had said privately that cross-strait
exchanges that have stalled in the wake of China's recent enactment
of an Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan would get back on track
after the election of the representatives to the ad hoc National
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Wu, however, made it clear that the government usually assesses
whether to tighten or relax cross-strait interactions based on a
number of things.
</P>
<P>
The election is only one factor in determining how future
relations will play out, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the election of the ad hoc National Assembly is
significant in that it will highlight the new mandate of the people.
For cross-strait exchanges to get back on a normal footing, however,
the MAC will cautiously weigh domestic political factors as well as
the international situation and the atmosphere across the Strait, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Wu added emphatically that proposed direct cross-strait charter
passenger flights for Tomb-sweeping Day, which falls on April 5,
would "not be feasible, " adding that the government has never said
it wants to promote direct cross-strait charter passenger flights on
holidays, and especially with this upcoming holiday which is only
days away. Moreover, the atmosphere has been soured by the enactment
of Beijing's new law.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, commenting on an article by Richard Bush, a former
chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan, to the China Times, a
major Chinese daily in Taiwan, Wu said that Bush is encouraging
Taiwan to adopt a responsible approach -- as it is now doing -- in
dealing with the law.
</P>
<P>
Bush said in his article that Taiwan can of course protest to
express its opposition to the Anti-Secession Law, but he also urged
Taiwan to protect its own interests and the status quo by not
overreacting.
</P>
<P>
Wu said self-restraint by Taiwan is present government policy.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Chiang urged the government "not to misread the
message sent by the U.S." He interpreted the former AIT chairman as
worrying that President Chen Shui-bian's participation in an upcoming
protest march against Beijing's law will exacerbate cross-strait
tensions.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that he didn't feel that the U.S. was concerned about
whether or not the president takes part in the Saturday protest,
adding that the U.S. "has never said that it is better that President
Chen not take to the streets."

<P>
Former President Lee Teng-hui will join
his successor, Chen Shui-bian, and Premier Frank Hsieh in
participating in a large rally set for March 26 in Taipei against
China's Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan, organizers said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, Lee will only walk part of the way and will not give a
speech, the organizers said.
</P>
<P>
Also on March 26, the pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) will hold a sit-in in Kaohsiung City against what it terms
China's aggressive legislation.
</P>
<P>
According to TSU Legislator Lo Chih-ming and Kaohsiung City
Councilor Chao Tien-lin, participants at the demonstration will be
encouraged to bring along their notebook computers or PDAs to send
out protest letters to the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
To set an example, the two politicians and a group of young
people on Thursday sent e-mails to U.S. President George W. Bush, the
United Nations and China's Taiwan Affairs Office to express the
objections of the people of Taiwan toward the Anti-Secession Law.
</P>
<P>
The letters stressed that Taiwan is an independent, sovereign
state and that any decision concerning Taiwan will have to be
approved by the 23 million people on the island.
</P>
<P>
It said China has no right to determine the fate of Taiwan
unilaterally and it should scrap its Anti-Secession Law immediately.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislators
on Thursday called on people, regardless of their ethnic background,
to come out and take part in the March 26 rally to "protect Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Lai Ching-teh, a whip of the DPP legislative caucus, said Taiwan
should not be fractured by ethnic differences.
</P>
<P>
Regardless where they are from, what language they speak and
whether they are Republic of China nationals, people should reject
China's annexation as long as they identify with Taiwan's
sovereignty, democracy and freedom, Lai said.
</P>
<P>
The "326 March for Democracy and Peace" is being organized by the
DPP-led Taiwan Democratic Alliance for Peace, with a goal of
attracting at least one million participants.

<P>
It is improper for military personnel to
take part in Saturday's protest in Taipei given that the purpose of
the demonstration does not conform to the military's mission,
Minister of National Defense Lee Jye said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lee made the remarks while answering questions from opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers Ting Shou-chung and Lu Shiow-yen in an
interpellation session at the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that a large demonstration is being organized
for this weekend to protest Beijing's Anti-Secession Law aimed at
Taiwan, Lee said he believes that all military members are fully
aware of relevant regulations, and that none of them will participate
in the rally.
</P>
<P>
As for non-military personnel within the Ministry of National
Defense, Lee said that it is up to their own discretion whether or
not to participate.
</P>
<P>
Lee also said that the military has no plan to step up its combat
preparedness that same day, as no abnormal activities of the Chinese
military have been detected in recent days. The defense minister
added that he himself will keep a close tab on military movements on
the other side of the Taiwan Strait Saturday.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian and Premier Frank Hsieh have both
announced that they will take part in the demonstration, which
organizers said is expected to draw at least one million people from
across the country.
</P>
<P>
Beijing enacted the law on March 14 to stem moves toward Taiwan
independence through non-peaceful means under conditions that it

Guatemala was a success.
</P>
<P>
Lu made the remarks after her arrival back at Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
In addition to helping consolidate relations with two of the
Republic of China's diplomatic allies in Central America, Lu said,
her 12-day overseas visit also laid the groundwork for local
entrepreneurs to launch new investment projects in the region.
</P>
<P>
During her visit, Lu said, she and her entourage received a warm
welcome from the top leaders and senior officials of the two host
countries. Lu was also invited to deliver speeches at the Salvadoran
and Guatemalan parliaments and their noted universities.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the presidents and parliamentarians of the two Central
American allies all voiced their opposition to Beijing's
Anti-Secession Law aimed at Taiwan and extended their staunch support
for Taiwan's cause.
</P>
<P>
"The Guatemalan parliamentary speaker has promised to join with
his counterparts in other Central American countries that maintain
diplomatic ties with us in issuing a joint statement against China's
Anti-Secession Law and in support of our national stance after the
Easter holiday, " Lu said, adding that all these moves point to the
success of her visit in cementing bilateral diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
On the promotion of bilateral economic cooperation, Lu said 18
possible cooperative projects have been worked out by the 100-plus
members of the delegation that accompanied her on her two-leg Central
America visit.
</P>
<P>
"The mission members from government agencies, the academic
community and the business circles made field studies and held
numerous rounds of talks with their Salvadoran and Guatemalan
counterparts to flesh out 18 feasible cooperative projects in
agricultural and industrial fields, " Lu said, adding that she will
host a news conference Friday to unveil details of those proposed
cooperative projects.
</P>
<P>
She further said Guatemalan President Oscar Berger Perdomo, and
Salvadoran Vice President Ana Vilma De Escobar, are to visit Taipei
later this year to sign free trade agreements or attend the
inaugural ceremony of the Pacific Democratic Union.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Lu said, Taiwan's decision to finance an historical
relics restoration and renovation project in Guatemala has received
wide acclaim and recognition from the United States.
</P>
<P>
During her stay in Guatemala City, Lu signed a letter of intent
with her Guatemalan counterpart on Taiwan's participation in the
cultural relics restoration project. According to preliminary plans,
Taiwan will help restore and renovate Museum Pilar de Zaragoza and
Monastery Sor Juana located in Antigua City, a monumental city
founded in 1543 with strong Spanish colonial influence.
</P>
<P>
Restoration and renovation of the two historical sites are
expected to be completed in two years, with a budget of around
US$700,000, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Turning to domestic affairs, Lu urged local people to join a huge
protest march in Taipei this weekend to voice their opposition to
Beijing's so-called anti-secession law.
</P>
<P>
"The people of Taiwan should take to the streets to defend our
national dignity and sovereignty in a peaceful and rational manner, "
Lu said, adding she is hopeful that all would-be demonstrators
refrain from irrational or extremist actions.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether she will take part in the protest march, Lu said
she has yet to make a decision. "I'll discuss with President Chen
Shui-bian and then make a decision in terms of the general situation
and my health," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Because of her hectic schedule, Lu developed an acute
inflammation of her left eye. Doctors said her eye will soon get
better.
</P>
<P>
Lu made transit stops in Houston and Miami en route to and from
Central America.

TAIWAN TO RESIST CHINA'S AGGRESSION WITH DEMOCRACY: DPP
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 24 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Chairman Su Tseng-chang Thursday called on people to take an active
part in the March 26 rally against China's Anti-Secession Law, saying
Taiwan must resist the aggressive legislation with democracy.
</P>
<P>
Su said more than 500 civic groups have signed up for the event
and that opinion polls also show that more than 1.4 million people
have decided to participate.
</P>
<P>
Su made the remarks at a news conference hosted by the DPP-led
Taiwan Democratic Alliance for Peace, the organizer of the "326 March
for Democracy and Peace" to be held in Taipei. The group has set a
goal of attracting at least one million participants.
</P>
<P>
According to Su, the 23 million peace-loving people in Taiwan
have never tried to provoke anyone, but China has turned a blind eye
to Taiwan's goodwill and its efforts to maintain cross-Taiwan Strait
peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
While Taiwan has built up an open and democratic society after
decades of hard work, undemocratic China is now using the
Anti-Secession Law that authorizes the use of non-peaceful means
against Taiwan's 23 million people, Su said.
</P>
<P>
He said the parade will be an unprecedented one that was
initiated spontaneously by the private sector, with one million
people demonstrating their firm resolve to protect Taiwan's
sovereignty, democracy and freedom.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian, Premier Frank Hsieh and former
President Lee Teng-hui have all decided to take part in the rally.
</P>
<P>
The protesters will be divided into 10 groups, who will set off
from 10 different places in Taipei and march to the boulevard in
front of the Presidential Office, according to the alliance.

TAIWAN BAR ASSOCIATION MEMBERS TO JOIN 326 MARCH
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 23 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Members of the Taiwan Bar Association will
take part in the "326 March for Democracy and Peace" Saturday to
protest Beijing's enactment of an Anti-Secession Law targeting
Taiwan, an association official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lawyer Su You-chen, secretary-general of the Taiwan Bar
Association, which groups some 4,000 lawyers practicing in Taiwan,
called for all members of the association to participate in the rally
to be held in Taipei to protest the Beijing law, which authorizes
China's People's Liberation Army to take Taiwan by "non-peaceful
means" if it thinks Taiwan is making moves toward independence.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Bar Association will also issue a petition with
signatures of lawyers from the organization Saturday to say "no" to
China's aggression, Su said.
</P>
<P>
Su claimed that the Anti-Secession Law violates the United
Nations charter of protecting "racial autonomy" and people's rights
pledged by the U.N. Declaration of Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
This pre-emptive Anti-Secession Law is changing the cross-strait
status quo unilaterally and bringing the people across the Strait to
the brink of war, Su claimed, adding that the law also infringes on
the Taiwan people's rights to survival and autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Stressing "no to war, aggression and annexation; yes to peace,
freedom and democracy, " the bar association will also seek support
from its counterparts in the international community, as well as
international human rights bodies, Su added.

BUSINESS AS USUAL FOR ECONOMICS MINISTER AFTER PREMIER'S HARSH WORDS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 24 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh
said Thursday that an apparent "dressing down" by Premier Frank Hsieh
the previous day did not bother her and that there was nothing in the
air about her having to change jobs.
</P>
<P>
Ho made the remarks when she was reporting on the budget of the
state-owned Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) for 2005 to the Economics
and Energy Committee in the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Legislators instead were more concerned about how the premier
took her to task in a Cabinet floor meeting the previous day for not
keeping him informed about the price hikes of petroleum products of
the state-owned Chinese Petroleum Corp. and Taiwan Fertilizer's
investment project in mainland China. The premier said that those in
the Ministry of Economic Affairs should think deeply about their
actions.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that sour relations between Ho and Hsieh could be
traced to the time when the former was vice chairman of the Council
for Economic Planning and Development and the latter was former
Kaohsiung mayor. The reports also said that Ho could see her post
change in the second-wave of Cabinet appointments in August.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh's Cabinet retained most of the members from the previous
one with only minor changes when he assumed the premiership on Feb.
1.
</P>
<P>
Ho said that prices for petroleum products are subject to the
free market, and recent surges in oil prices have forced the
adjustment of petroleum prices in Taiwan. The premier is concerned
about changes to the public's lifestyle due to the change in oil and
consumer prices, so he had asked her to inform him prior to price
hikes. She didn't feel that the premier was "scolding her."
</P>
<P>
Ho said that the Executive Yuan had made no such requests before,
and the ministry will from now on follow instructions. "My feelings
are not affected," she added.
</P>
<P>
On the reports that she might be shifted to a different position,
Ho said that the premier had said before that there would be a
accommodation period between himself and Cabinet members, and it
would be reasonable for a Cabinet reshuffle in August, although she
was not aware of any impending changes.

MOST TO PAY LESS IN HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS UNDER DOH'S NEW PROGRAM
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Department of Health (DOH) has
re-engineered the National Health Insurance system so that 74 percent
of those covered will pay less in premiums, DOH Minister Ho Sheng-mao
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ho gave the outline of the "second-generation program, " at the
Legislative Yuan. The health department is banking of the success of
the new system to salvage the cash-strapped program.
</P>
<P>
Ho said a great majority of the people will not necessarily pay
more in health insurance premiums under the new system, but premiums
for high-income people will definitely increase.
</P>
<P>
Six categories of the insured will be scrapped, and the premium
payment will be changed from being based on individual incomes to
household incomes, and the government and employers will also
shoulder the premium payments according to a set formula.
</P>
<P>
Lee Cheng-hua, vice president of the Bureau of National Health
Insurance, said that the revenue of the national health insurance
premium is expected to increase by 1.2 percent under the
second-generation health insurance program.

TAIWAN TO REOPEN IMPORTS OF U.S. BEEF NEXT MONTH: HEALTH DEPARTMENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 24 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan will conditionally allow U.S. beef
back into the local market beginning April 16 following the
suspension of imports in 2003 due to the discovery of a case of mad
cow disease, a Department of Health official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. beef and beef products, that is, beef cattle under 2.5 years
old, clear of specific risk materials, including bones, offal, brain,
trigeminal ganglia, dorsal root ganglia and spinal marrow, and with
certificates issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA),
will be allowed to be imported into Taiwan from April 16, said Chen
Lu-hung, director of the health department's Bureau of Food Safety.
</P>
<P>
The bureau will also ask the USDA to provide Taiwan with a list
of the names of legal, contracted U.S. slaughterhouses to be used as
a reference to make sure that all the beef reintroduced into Taiwan
are from these companies, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The health department will also consult with the Cabinet-level
Council of Agriculture for other details pertaining to the imports,
Chen added.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan suspended beef imports from the United States in December
2003 due to safety concerns over bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE), also known as mad cow disease, after the discovery in the U.S.
state of Washington of a single BSE case at a cattle ranch.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan health and agriculture officials have traveled to the U.S.
to conduct on-site inspections of the implementation of the U.S.
safeguards against mad cow disease and have recently completed the
reviews necessary for resuming the beef trade.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan purchased US$325 million worth of U.S. beef and beef
products in 2003 and was the sixth-largest importer of U.S. beef
before Taiwan imposed the ban in December 2003. Since then,
Australian beef has replaced U.S. beef in the Taiwan market.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 countries, including Japan, the largest importer,
have imposed embargoes against U.S. beef, seriously affecting the
U.S. beef export trade, which is worth at least US$3.8 billion a
year. Big names in the beef export trade, including Tyson Foods, Inc.
and Cargill, Inc., have exerted great pressure on the USDA for the
early resumption of exports to these former importing countries.

JOB-CREATION PROJECT HELPS LOWER 2004 JOBLESS RATE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 24 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The overall unemployment rate for 2004
dropped by 0.55 percent from the previous year's level to 4.44
percent thanks to a government program aimed at creating short-term
jobs for underprivileged groups, a government official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The government began to carry out a project of expanding
employment in the public service sector in 2003 to help curb the
growing jobless rate, said the official with the Cabinet-level
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD).
</P>
<P>
The official pointed out that the job creation program ended
earlier this year, with the total outlay reaching NT$28.5 billion
(US$0.91 billion) , adding that a total of 8,200 job opportunities
were created during the 2003-2004 period. 
</P>
<P>
As for the backgrounds of those hired for public services under
the program, the official said that people aged 50-65 accounted for
50 percent of the total and that those having an education level
lower than junior high school made up 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-six percent of those hired said that the
employment-boosting program was of much help to them while 89 percent
expressed satisfaction with the project, the official went on.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has also implemented a public
construction expansion project since December 2002 to create
employment opportunities for jobless people.
</P>
<P>
The official said that around 100 local construction programs
which require an outlay of NT$57.7 billion, including communications,
flood prevention and living environment improvement, have been
launched, thereby creating 40,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
The budget execution rate for the expanding public construction
project stood at 96 percent, while the project contributed with 0.16
percentage points and 0.23 percentage points to the nation's 2003 and
2004 economic growth rate, respectively.

TAIWANESE GROUPS IN NEW YORK, NEW JERSEY CONDEMN ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
New  York,  March  23  (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leaders of Taiwanese groups and
associations in New York and New Jersey on Wednesday strongly
condemned China's enactment of the Anti-Secession Law targeting
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen Taiwanese associations, including the Taiwan
Compatriot Association in Greater New York, issued a three-point
statement after a meeting in Flushing, New York, Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the law authorizes "non-peaceful means" against
Taiwan should the island move toward formal independence, the leaders
said that the status quo of the Republic of China is its independent
sovereignty, and that Chinese authorities should not invade it by any
means.
</P>
<P>
They also said that peace is the only option to solve
cross-strait issues, and that they oppose Beijing using the pretext
of anti-secession to invade Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, they said the authoritarian system in China is the
greatest threat to stability in Asia and the Pacific, and that China
should engage in democratic reforms as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two dozen Taiwanese associations in northern
California will stage a "326 March for Democracy and Peace" in tandem
with the activity sponsored by the Taiwan Democratic Alliance for
Peace in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 Taiwan expatriates are expected to take part in the
march and protest against the passage of the Anti-Secession Law in
front of China's general consulate in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
An action committee to protest against China's Anti-Secession Law
also said that the ROC is a sovereign, independent country and is
independent to the People's Republic of China, and that Taiwan's
future will hinge on the consent of its 23 million people and no other
countries have the right to decide its fate unilaterally.

PRESIDENT CALLS FOR DEMOCRACY, PEACE TO REPLACE AUTOCRACY, FORCE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday
that Taiwan expects China to use rational, democratic and peaceful
methods, not "non-peaceful means," in its rise as a regional power.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks at the annual congress of the Association
of Asian Election Authorities (AAEA), which is being held in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China's quick rise has led to both expectations and
concerns in the international community, Chen said he is worried
about failure by Beijing to recognize that an attempt to use
"non-peaceful means" to deal with relations across the Taiwan Strait
could cause cross-strait tension and regional instability.
</P>
<P>
In his view, Chen went on, peace and democracy are the best cure
for autocracy and military force. "We look forward to China's early
democratization," Chen added.
</P>
<P>
The AAEA was founded in Manila in 1998 to provide a non-partisan
forum for the exchange of information among election authorities to
discuss and act on ways to promote open and transparent elections
with the objective of supporting good governance and democracy.
Similar associations have also been set up in the Caribbean, Central
and Eastern Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
Chen said one of the toughest challenges facing Asia's democratic
countries lies in pushing and assisting undemocratic countries in the
region to peacefully and smoothly transform themselves into
democracies.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, Chen said, residents in the
authoritarian China-ruled Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
have continued to campaign for democratic reform and an end to
authoritarian rule.
</P>
<P>
Now that Taiwan has emerged as a strong force in the Asian
democratic community, Chen said, he hopes that core democratic
values, such as regular democratic elections, fair inter-party
competition, peaceful power transition and de-linking of the military
from politics, can become realities in China someday.
</P>
<P>
Chen further said 2004 could be described as the "year of
elections in Asia" with many Asian countries, including Taiwan,
holding general elections during the year.
</P>
<P>
"Although the electoral proceedings were not impeccable in
various Asian countries, the elections embodied two precious values
of democracy -- freedom of choice and fair competition," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
As a model of Asia's emerging democracies, Chen said, the
Republic of China held its third direct presidential election last
year. The people of Taiwan used "love" and democratic votes to elect
him to a second term, Chen said, adding that the ROC government made
strenuous efforts to prevent vote-buying and violence in the process.
</P>
<P>
Despite some controversies, Chen went on, Taiwan's judicial
authorities have proved that the 2004 presidential election was open,
fair, just and impartial.
</P>
<P>
Simultaneous with the 2004 presidential election, Chen said,
Taiwan also held its first-ever nationwide referendum to show the
world by a democratic method that only peaceful talks on an equal
footing can forge a stable cross-strait relationship. The referendum
also indicated that Taiwan must beef up its self-defense capability
to protect Taiwan's hard-won democracy from being sabotaged by China
through non-peaceful means.

U.S.  INFORMED OF PRESIDENT'S DECISION TO JOIN 326 RALLY: MOFA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 24 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States maintains close contact
with Taiwan and is undoubtedly aware of President Chen Shui-bian's
decision to take part in the March 26 rally against China's
Anti-Secession Law, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chen announced earlier in the day that he will participate in the
demonstration to be held in Taipei but will not give a speech or play
the leading role.
</P>
<P>
According to MOFA spokesman Michel Lu at a regular news briefing,
Washington has said explicitly that the law, which virtually
authorizes war against Taiwan, is unwelcome and has urged Taiwan to
deal with the situation rationally, but it has not told Taiwan what
not to do.
</P>
<P>
When the international media has paid much attention to the
rally, all people of Taiwan, regardless of their political
affiliations, should unite together against China and make Taiwan's
position known to the international community, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Lu said Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen will also take
part in the rally, while staff of the ministry are free to decide
whether to participate or not.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, National Security Bureau official Liu
Shuo-tzung told the legislature's Judiciary Committee that the bureau
will make full preparations to protect President Chen's security
during the rally to prevent a repeat of last year's presidential
election-eve shooting of the president and Vice President Annette Lu.
</P>
<P>
National Police Agency Deputy Director-General Hung Sheng-kun
said the police will closely monitor the rally to decide how many
policemen will be dispatched to maintain order.
</P>
<P>
Usually, the ratio will be 1,000 policemen to every 100,000
participants, Hung said.
</P>
<P>
The organizer of the "326 March for Democracy and Peace" is
expecting at least one million participants. In addition to President
Chen, Premier Frank Hsieh and former President Lee Teng-hui have also
decided to participate.
</P>
<P>
However, Chen's and Hsieh's decision met with strong challenges
from the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP) ,
which believe it is inappropriate for national leaders to take to the
streets.
</P>
<P>
According to KMT legislative caucus whip Chen Chieh, the
government should deal with cross-Taiwan Strait issues with wisdom,
not emotion.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chieh said the president's move is making the public
confused as to which direction he is leading the country.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the country's economic development, rather than
such political mobilization, is what the people are concerned about.
</P>
<P>
Lee Yung-ping, a leader of the PFP legislative caucus, said
President Chen, by taking part in the demonstration to pacify the
resentment of pro-independence hardliners, will give the
international community the wrong impression that the Republic of
China is subordinate to the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Also expressing his disapproval of Chen's decision, ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Lin Cho-shui said
staging a demonstration against China should be the job of the
people, not government officials.
</P>
<P>
In response to the criticism, Lai Ching-teh, a whip of the DPP
legislative caucus, said although Chen is the head of state, he is
still a member of the 23 million people on Taiwan who are obliged to
come out to express their objections to the Anti-Secession Law.
</P>
<P>
Lai claimed President Chen's participation is not out of
proportion because he will avoid giving a speech in the rally to play
down his role as the president.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chen Chien-ming, secretary-general of the
pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity Union, said his party will respect
the decision of the president.

DEFENSE MINISTER DEFENDS URGENT NEED TO PURCHASE SUBMARINES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  24 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Minister of National Defense Lee Jye
defended Thursday a clear need to acquire submarines to safeguard
Taiwan, warning that China's navy is building a force with a long
range war capability that will pose a serious threat to Taiwan by
2020.
</P>
<P>
Lee made the remarks while giving a keynote report on a proposal
by his ministry on its submarine purchase, part of a major
procurement plan worth billions of dollars of military equipment from
the United States that also includes six PAC III Patriot
anti-missile batteries and 12 P-3C Orion anti-submarine aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Saying that it is urgent and vital to purchase submarines to
protect the country, Lee said that by 2020, the Chinese navy will be
capable of reaching regions including the Taiwan Strait, the South
China Sea and the Strait of Malacca.
</P>
<P>
At that time, it will generate a huge threat to Taiwan's economy
and security, as the country totally relies on shipping to transport
military and daily consumption materials through sea lanes in these
regions, he warned, adding that with more than 80 submarines, the
Chinese navy will be able to enforce a blockade against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
To effectively deter such a possible attack, Taiwan has to own at
least 10 submarines before 2020, which is the reason behind the
ministry's plan to buy advanced diesel-electric subs equipped with
sophisticated missiles from the United States that would help the
Taiwan navy upgrade its surveillance abilities five-fold and
tremendously sharpen its attack capabilities, he said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that his ministry has slashed its budget for
eight subs to NT$297 billion (US$9.42 billion) from the previous
level of NT$412 billion after taking into account a stronger new
Taiwan dollar and a business strategy ruling out constructing the
ships at home due to a lack of expertise.
</P>
<P>
In the face of discontent from various lawmakers of the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) over what they describe "a high
quotation" from the United States, the minister claimed that the high
cost is due to the need for the United States to find a builder in a
third country or reopen its own production lines to build the subs, a
cost that has to be borne by Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, ministry officials said Taiwan
will be entitled to take over the blueprint and manufacturing
facilities for the subs after the eight vessels have been built. They
added that the ministry will seek cooperation opportunities from the
United States in follow-up maintenance and repairs and promised to
continue negotiations on a cheaper price offer.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's budget allocation for the eight submarines is the
most disputed section of the arms procurement plan, which has
triggered a partisan strife at the opposition-controlled Legislative
Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers of the opposition "pan blue alliance" of the KMT, the
People First Party and the New Party are strongly opposed to the arms
procurement deal, calling it no more than pork barrel politics that
will leave Taiwan's younger generations strapped with huge debt.

Taipei,  March  24 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)

<TEXT>
<P>
The 326 March for Democracy and Peace
against Beijing's enactment of its Anti-Secession Law is scheduled to
kick off from 10 locations in Taipei at around 2:30 p.m.
Saturday, the Taipei Municipal Police Department reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Protesters are expected to converge from around noon at the 10
locations, in preparation for walking a variety of routes around the
city from 2: 30 p.m. to the Gongyuan-Ketagalan Plaza in front of the
Presidential Office, according to a spokesman for the police
department.
</P>
<P>
The 10 locations are: the Zhongshan Stadium; Taiping Elementary
School on Chongqing North Road; the Rongxing Garden; Mingsheng East
Road, Sec. 2; Tunhua Elementary School on Tunhua South Road; the
Songshan Tobacco Factory; Taan Forest Park; National Taiwan
University; the Mengjia Boulevard and Wanda Street Intersection; and
the Zhongxing Bridge.
</P>
<P>
The police have no clue yet how long the marchers will take to
reach the plaza, given the uncertainty in the number of people
expected to turn out.
</P>
<P>
The marchers, who will include President Chen Shui-bian, Premier
Frank Hsieh and former President Lee Teng-hui, will meet at the plaza
for a short period before the march ends there, according to the
police.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Taipei police said that some 3,000 tourist buses

TAIWAN TO PUSH FOR TARIFF LOWERING AT WTO NAMA TALKS: OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 24 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's plan to push for lowered customs
tariffs on eight industrial products has received support and
recognition from several World Trade Organization (WTO) member
states, an official with the Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
BOFT Deputy Director-General Wu Hsin-hua said that on the
sidelines of a recent WTO conference on non-agricultural market
access (NAMA) , Taiwan delegates held talks with their counterparts
from the United States, Canada, Japan, South Korea and Switzerland
over a proposal to lower tariffs on garments, hand tools, timepieces,
bicycles, dyestuffs, sporting goods, musical instruments and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from these WTO member countries threw their
support behind the proposal, aimed at boosting development of the
global trade, and pledged to cooperate with Taiwan on relevant issues
during future WTO talks, said Wu, who was also present at the
conference.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, the NAMA talks involved the lowering of tariffs
on industrial, fishery and forest products and is one of the issues
of the WTO Doha Round of trade negotiations that has drawn great
attention from many member states.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from WTO member economies have held five rounds of NAMA
talks since the so-called "July Package" was unveiled last year, but
no real negotiations on tariff lowering formulas and complementary
measures took place until the March 14-18 meeting, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Wu added that formulaic tariff reductions will help reach the
goal of lowering tariffs, but said the measure should target specific
sectors because the tariffs structures of WTO member states are
different.

MOJ REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO TIGHTENING WIRETAPPING AUTHORIZATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   March  24  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Minister of Justice Shih Mao-lin
reaffirmed Thursday the government's resolve to transfer the
authority to order wiretaps from prosecutors to judges.
</P>
<P>
Shih made the reaffirmation at a Legislative Yuan interpellation
session in which lawmakers from across the political spectrum
lambasted what they said is the abuse of wiretap authorization by law
enforcement authorities.
</P>
<P>
Shih said even though police authorities remain opposed to the
proposal to delegate wiretap authorization to judges instead of
prosecutors in the future, the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) is
determined to uphold this new policy line.
</P>
<P>
At present, prosecutors' offices at various levels are tasked
with the job of screening and authorizing wiretap applications.
</P>
<P>
Shih assured the lawmakers that the MOJ will come up with a draft
package of revisions to the existing law as soon as possible to pave
the way for transferring the wiretap authorization.
The draft bill will then be referred to the legislature for approval,
Shih added.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics compiled by the State Public
Prosecutor-General's Office, a total of 19,485 wiretap applications
were approved in 2004, a whopping increase from about 3,000 recorded
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 percent of the authorized wiretaps were related to
drug trafficking and firearm trading investigations, and less than 10
percent were related to corruption probes. The wiretaps in some cases
lasted for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, the number of authorized wiretaps in Taiwan was
almost double the number authorized in the United States in 2004.
Lawmakers said the phenomenon was unreasonable given the population
gap between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"The United States has a population of more than 200 million,
while Taiwan has only 23 million people. It seems to me that the
number of our authorized wiretaps has grown out of proportion to our
population and indicates that our prosecution authorities do not
respect people's privacy and human rights, " Legislator Peng
Shao-chin of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party said.

IMPORT BAN ON U.S. LIVE CATTLE TO REMAIN IN PLACE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An import ban on live cattle from the
United States will remain in place after U.S. beef is allowed to
enter the Taiwan market again next month, the Cabinet-level Council
of Agriculture (COA) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The council made the announcement after the Department of Health
(DOH) declared earlier in the day that the ban on U.S. beef imports
will be conditionally lifted April 16, ending a more-than one-year
import ban over concerns about bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE), also known as mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
COA officials said the lifting of the import ban will be
applicable strictly to items clearly listed by the DOH. The import
ban on live cattle and related products will remain in place in line
with regulations set forth by the World Animal Health Organization,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
According to the DOH announcement, U.S. beef and beef products,
that is beef cattle under 2.5 years old, clear of specific risk
materials, including bones, offal, brain, trigeminal ganglia,
dorsal root ganglia and spinal marrow, and with certificates issued
by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), will be allowed to
enter the Taiwan market from April 16.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan banned imports of U.S. beef, live cattle and all related
products in December 2003 after the discovery in the U.S. state of
Washington of a single BSE case.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan had been the sixth-largest market for U.S. beef before the
import ban was imposed in late 2003. Australia has since then
dominated the Taiwan beef market.

TAIWAN INVESTORS URGED TO DIVERSIFY INVESTMENT LOCATIONS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 24 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's business and industrial sectors
were urged Thursday to diversify their investment locations overseas
to prevent the investments from centering on Asia.
</P>
<P>
Opposition People First Party Legislator Liu Yi-ru, who was in
Vice President Annette Lu's entourage during a recent official visit
to Taiwan's Central American diplomatic allies of El Salvador and
Guatemala, called for Taiwan businessmen to direct their overseas
investment away from Asia, particularly China, to Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Liu, a finance professor-turned-legislator, said that nearly 80
percent of Taiwan's investments abroad are centered in Asia, leading
to great investment risks.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the administration provide Taiwan investors
with useful information on Latin America to help them make decisions
when they plan investments.
</P>
<P>
Bolstering investment in Central and South America will not only
be mutually beneficial economically for Taiwan and the target
countries, it will also help cement bilateral ties diplomatically,
Liu noted.
</P>
<P>
Liu quoted Lu as saying that people in Taiwan should also try to
develop interest in countries on the South American Continent instead
of focusing their interest only on Asian countries such as Japan and
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Legislator Yu Ching of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party, who was also in Lu's 152-member entourage, said
that Beijing passed its Anti-Secession Law exactly during the time
when the Taiwan delegation under Lu's leadership was visiting Central
America.
</P>
<P>
"We spared no efforts to win support in El Salvador, Guatemala
and the United States, where the delegation made transit stays in two
cities, for Taiwan's efforts to oppose the Beijing law, which
authorizes it to use 'non-peaceful means' against Taiwan should it
decide Taiwan is moving toward independence," Yu said.

JAPAN TO EMULATE TAIWAN CUSTOMS' SNIFFER DOG PROGRAM

Taipei,  March 24 (CNA)

<P>
Japan is to send officials to Taiwan to
learn from the country's experiences in using sniffer dogs at customs
offices to prevent illegal animals and plants from being smuggled
into Taiwan, sources from the Council of Agriculture (COA) said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government, which has decided to follow Australia
and the United States in using sniffer dogs as a means of
strengthening quarantine defense at customs and immigration offices,
will make use of Taiwan's experience, given that Taiwan is located
near Japan and the two countries share some common ground in culture
and other matters, according to COA officials.
</P>
<P>
Officials from Japan's Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries are expected to come to Taiwan in early April to learn from
Taiwan's experience in using sniffer dogs, in addition to gaining an
understanding of other affairs pertaining to quarantine work, COA
officials said.
</P>
<P>
According to the COA Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection
and Quarantine, Taiwan began to use three groups of sniffer dogs for
quarantine work at customs and immigration offices in 2002.
</P>
<P>
Today, there are eight groups of such dogs being worked at
international airports and seaports islandwide, bureau officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Altogether, the sniffer dogs searched a total of 12,232 arriving
aircraft and vessels between 2001 and February this year, discovering
7.9 metric tons of illegal animals and animal products, as well as
11.4 metric tons of illegal plants and plant products, the officials
said.

TAITRA TO HELP NARROW TAIWAN'S TRADE IMBALANCE WITH SOUTH KOREA

<TEXT>
<P>
The Taiwan External Trade Development
Council (TAITRA) will continue with a series of sales promotion
activities aimed at helping improve Taiwan's trade imbalance with
South Korea, a TAITRA official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan recorded a deficit of US$6 billion in its trade exchanges
with South Korea last year, so TAITRA and the Ministry of Economic
Affairs will concentrate their efforts on narrowing the island's
trade imbalance this year, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
A Taiwan delegation led by TAITRA officials took part in an
international exposition of automated equipment in Seoul, the
official went on, adding that several delegation members forged
agreements with South Korean agents to promote their products there.
</P>
<P>
During the first quarter of this year, the number of South Korean
buyers that came to Taiwan to visit the Taipei International Cycle
Show and the Taipei International Machine Tools Show at TAITRA's
invitation was higher than in the previous year, the official said.
While in Taipei, they also held trade talks with local manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
The official said that during the second quarter of this year,
several delegations organized by the Korean International Trade
Association (KITA) and the Korean Importers Association (KOIMA) will
arrive in Taiwan to hold trade talks with local manufacturers of
electronic and textile products, machinery and auto parts and
accessories.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, TAITRA will organize three delegations to participate
in consumer goods and food shows to be held in April and May in South
Korea to explore more trade opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The official suggested that Taiwan manufacturers wishing to
display their products in the upcoming Korean expositions should
prepare their catalogs in the Korean language if they want to win
more orders.

ROC LEGISLATIVE DELEGATION TO VISIT U.S. WITHIN TWO WEEKS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Republic of China legislative
delegation will visit the United States within the next two weeks,
ROC Representative to the United States David Ta-wei Lee confirmed
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that now is good time for the delegation to visit the
United States, noting that the international community has turned to
support Taiwan in the wake of China's recent enactment of its
Anti-Secession Law, which authorizes "non-peaceful means" against
Taiwan should the island move toward formal independence.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the United States has talked with the ROC representative
office about Taiwan's arms procurement plan, Lee only said that the
proposed procurement of six Patriot PAC-3 anti-missile batteries,
eight diesel-electric submarines and a squadron of 12 anti-submarine
jetfighters from the United States is major issue, and that he has
exchanged views with U.S. officials regularly since he assumed office
last year.
</P>
<P>
The arms procurement bill recently failed to be put on the
Legislative Yuan's agenda because of objections from the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" which holds a slight majority.

O'SEAS CHINESE, TAIWAN EXPATS IN DENMARK CONDEMN ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seven leading overseas Chinese and
Taiwanese organizations in Denmark issued a joint statement Thursday
condemning China's enactment of its so-called anti-secession law.
</P>
<P>
They said in the statement that since the law provides Beijing
with a legal basis to invade Taiwan by force, the international
community should condemn it.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of enacting such a law is to deprive the Taiwan
people of the right to determine their own future, the statement
said, adding that by doing so, China wants to change the status quo
in the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
It criticized the use of the anti-secession law to deal with the
de facto separation between the island and the mainland over the last
55 years as "unfit and ridiculous."
</P>
<P>
The United States, Japan and the European Union have voiced their
concerns about the law and urged Beijing to engage in dialogue with
Taiwan to solve cross-strait differences, the organizations said in
the statement, adding that they would also request that China use
peaceful means to resolve cross-strait differences.

MORE TAIWAN COMPANIES OPTIMISTIC ABOUT BUSINESS PROSPECTS: SURVEY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   March  25  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More Taiwan companies have become
optimistic about their business prospects for the next half year
mainly as a result of the atmosphere of reconciliation that has
emerged in Taiwan's politics since the beginning of this year, an
economic think-tank reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a survey conducted at the end of February on members of
Taiwan's industrial sector, the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research
(TIER) found that 54.6 percent of the respondents said they believe
that their business prospects will turn for the better in the
following six months, marking a steep rise from 26.9 percent in the
think tank's January survey.
</P>
<P>
In the February survey, 22 percent of the companies surveyed said
their business was "good" in that month, down from 25.8 percent in
January, and 41.3 percent said business was somewhat "unchanged, "
down from 52.8 percent the previous month, while 36.7 percent said
business turned for the worse, compared with only 21.4 percent in
January.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 36.9 percent of the respondents said they see their
business prospects remaining unchanged over the next six months, down
from 54.9 percent in January, while those who believe business will
slide in the next six months dropped to 8.5 percent from January's
18.2 percent, the TIER survey found.
</P>
<P>
Acting TIER President Hung Teh-sheng attributed the industrial
sector's optimism to several factors, including the emerging
atmosphere of reconciliation in Taiwan's politics, as witnessed by
the meeting between President Chen Shui-bian and opposition People
First Party Chairman James Soong on Feb. 24. After the meeting, the
two announced a 10-point consensus on several issues, including
efforts to promote cross-strait peace, national security and ethnic
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Also, Frank Hsieh's comments after being sworn in as the new
premier Feb. 1 that the new Cabinet would make consultations and
coexistence the cornerstone of its policies was another major reason
for the industrial sector's increased optimism, Hung said.
</P>
<P>
Hung added that the better-than-expected performance of the
economies of the United States and mainland China, the two major
markets for Taiwan's exports, also contributed to the Taiwan
industrial sector's increased confidence.

TAIWANESE IN EASTERN CANADA MARCH AGAINST CHINA'S ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Ottawa,  March  24 (CNA)
(By S.K. Wu, Eric Tseng and Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwanese groups and associations in
eastern Canada staged a protest march in the Canadian capital of
Ottawa Thursday against China's recent enactment of its so-called
anti-secession law.
</P>
<P>
More than 250 Taiwanese expatriates first gathered in the square
in front of the Parliament Hill buildings, where Chen Wen-lung,
president of aTaiwanese professors association, delivered a speech.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that the passage of the law provides China with a legal
basis to attack Taiwan. He also said that Beijing has deployed more
than 700 missiles in its southeast coastal provinces against Taiwan
and that the march is aimed at voicing serious protest against
Beijing's passage of the law and its "intentions to annex Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Several Canadian parliamentarians were also on hand to lend their
support for the cause.
</P>
<P>
The participants then marched toward the Chinese Embassy to
deliver a protest letter, which was accepted by a Royal Canadian
Mounted Police officer to hand over to the embassy as the embassy had
shut its doors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Taiwanese associations in the greater New York area
are planning a protest march Saturday in line with the large-scale
"326 March for Democracy and Peace" activity in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
The organizers of the march said that participants would first
gather in front of the U.N. headquarters at 10: 30 a.m. and then
march toward the Chinese general consulate in New York to protest.
</P>
<P>
They said some 500 people are expected to take part in the march,
which will go through Times Square in Manhattan in order to attract
the attention of New Yorkers and tourists there.

CONSENSUS ESSENTIAL ON COUNTERING BEIJING LAW: ROC PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Friday that
public consensus is essential on whether to enact a law to counter
China's Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the remarks during a general interpellation session at
the Legislative Yuan in which Legislator Yeh Yi-jin of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party asked whether the government has any
substantive measures, such as a legislation, to counter Beijing's
Anti-Secession Law which authorizes "non-peaceful means" against
Taiwan should the island move toward formal independence.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said that legislation will require a national consensus,
adding that for now, the Cabinet will call international attention to
the threat posed to Taiwan by the law and try to make China feel the
heat from the international community and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh noted that through the law, China can arbitrarily decide if
Taiwan "has crossed the red line" and take action in response.
However, if the international community applies pressure to Beijing,
the latter will then be more careful in deciding when and if Taiwan
has crossed the line, he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about government employees taking part in Saturday's "326
March for Democracy and Peace, " the premier said that he has urged
all Taiwan people to take part in the march, including government
employees. He added, however, that they are free to decide for
themselves whether they will participate.

AIT WELCOMES TAIWAN DECISION TO REOPEN TO U.S. BEEF IMPORTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Kaohsiung,  March 25 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States welcomes Taiwan's
announcement Thursday that it will reopen its market to U.S. boneless
beef from cattle under 30 months of age starting April 16, the
American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) said in a news bulletin Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Republic of China Department of Health (DOH) announced
Thursday that Taiwan will conditionally allow U.S. beef back into the
local market beginning April 16 following the suspension of imports
in 2003 due to the discovery of a case of mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
U.S. beef and beef products, that is, beef cattle under 2.5 years
old, clear of bones, offal and specific risk materials including
brain, trigeminal ganglia, dorsal root ganglia and spinal marrow, and
with certificates issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture
(USDA), will be allowed to be imported into Taiwan from April 16,
said Chen Lu-hung, director of the health department's Bureau of Food
Safety.
</P>
<P>
Ground beef will not be included in the opening list, Chen added.
</P>
<P>
The AIT is a quasi-official organization authorized by Washington
to handle U.S. exchanges with Taiwan in the absence of formal
diplomatic relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In the news bulletin, the AIT Kaohsiung Office said that the DOH
decision was made after completing a meticulous and long-term
assessment on the U.S. system for deterring any further spread of mad
cow disease.
</P>
<P>
The AIT Kaohsiung Office said that the United States is studying
the details of the DOH announcement about the reopening policy. The
office said it expects the governments of the two countries to work
together to help implement the decision.
</P>
<P>
The DOH Bureau of Food Safety will ask the USDA to provide Taiwan
with a list of the names of legal, contracted U.S. slaughterhouses to
be used as a reference to make sure that all the beef introduced into
Taiwan is from these companies, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The health department will also consult with the Cabinet-level
Council of Agriculture (COA) for other details pertaining to the
imports, Chen added.
</P>
<P>
COA officials said later Thursday that an import ban on live
cattle from the United States will remain in place after U.S. beef is
allowed to enter the Taiwan market again next month.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that the lifting of the import ban will be
applicable strictly to items clearly listed by the DOH. The import
ban on live cattle and related products will remain in place in line
with regulations set forth by the World Animal Health Organization,
they said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan suspended beef imports from the United States in December
2003 due to safety concerns over bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE), also known as mad cow disease, after the discovery of a single
case of mad cow disease on a ranch in the U.S. state of Washington.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan health and agriculture officials have traveled to the U.S.
to conduct on-site inspections of the implementation of the U.S.
safeguards against mad cow disease and have recently completed the
reviews necessary for resuming the beef trade.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan purchased US$325 million worth of U.S. beef and beef
products in 2003 and was the sixth-largest importer of U.S. beef
before Taiwan imposed the ban in December 2003. Since then,
Australian beef has replaced U.S. beef in the Taiwan market.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 countries, including Japan, the largest importer,
have imposed bans on U.S. beef, seriously affecting the U.S. beef
export trade, which is worth at least US$3.8 billion a year. Big
names in the beef export trade, including Tyson Foods Inc. and
Cargill Inc., have exerted great pressure on the USDA for the early
resumption of exports to these countries.
</P>
<P>
The AIT had also been contacting relevant Taiwan officials in an
effort to speed up the paperwork so that U.S. beef can reenter the
Taiwan market at an earlier date.

PRESIDENT TO LEAD ONE MILLION PEOPLE TO SING 'WE SHALL OVERCOME'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian is expected to
lead one million participants to sing the U.S. civil rights movement
key anthem, "We Shall Overcome, " during Saturday's rally against
China's Anti-Secession Law, a ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
DPP spokesman Cheng Wen-tsan pointed out that the song represents
the pursuit of an equal and democratic society, which he said
perfectly matches the theme of the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
In addition to "We Shall Overcome, " Mandarin, Taiwanese, Hakka
and aboriginal songs that represent the four main ethnic groups in
Taiwan have been selected for the participants to sing in chorus at
the rally, Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
The "326 March for Democracy and Peace," organized by the DPP-led
Taiwan Democratic Alliance for Peace, will see at least one million
people set off from 10 different places in Taipei and march toward
the boulevard in front of the Presidential Office for a huge
gathering, the organizers said.
</P>
<P>
President Chen announced a day earlier that he will take part in
the event but will not give a speech or play the leading role.
</P>
<P>
According to Presidential Office Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun,
President Chen's decision is aimed at highlighting his identity as a
member of the 23 million population in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Yu said that the country's diplomatic allies have been informed
of the president's decision and that they have expressed no opinion
on the matter.
</P>
<P>
He said national security authorities have not finalized as to
which route the president and the first family will take because
there are a number of security issues that must be taken into
consideration.
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, legislators from the pro-independence Taiwan
Solidarity Union held a press conference to urge all people of Taiwan
to join the rally to voice their protest to China.
</P>
<P>
The legislators gulped down foods and beverages named after
current and former Chinese leaders in front of the media to express
their anger at the enactment of the Anti-Secession Law, which
authorizes the use of non-peaceful means against Taiwan should the
island move toward independence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, with all legislators from the DPP expected to
participate in the rally, a group of female DPP legislators announced
Friday that they will give away "peace candy" and "happiness cake" to
the participants to wish them peace and happiness.

FISHERY SEMINAR TO EXPLORE DEEP-SEA FISHING MANPOWER PROBLEMS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 25 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A seminar on deep-sea fishing manpower
issues will be held Monday as part of the government's efforts to
formulate new policy and strategies for sustainable fishery industry
development, a Council of Agriculture (COA) official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, to be organized by the COA's Fishery Administration,
will focus on the supply and demand of fishing manpower, upgrading
the quality of the fishery workforce and improvement of the shipboard
working environment, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The one-day seminar will bring together officials from city and
county governments, representatives of local fishing industry
associations, scholars and experts to explore manpower-related
problems faced by local fishing boat owners and feasible measures to
resolve them, the official said.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the seminar will be the first of a
series of forums to be held this year to tackle fishing industry
issues with a view to opening up new opportunities for the local
fishing industry.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the official said, Taiwan's fishing industry has
encountered many problems, including manpower shortages, a coastal
fishery resources drain and increasing global competition in deep-sea
fishing.
</P>
<P>
Besides manpower issues, the official said, other seminars to be
held later this year will tackle issues regarding the sustainable
management of coastal fishery resources, coastal law and offshore
fishing industry development, the most suitable scale and management
of the deep-sea fishing industry and core values of fishermen's
associations.
</P>
<P>
"All the findings and conclusions from the planned series of
seminars will serve as reference for the formulation of our future
fishery development policies and strategies," the official said.

LAWMAKERS DISAGREE ON GOVERNMENT INVESTMENT IN HIGH SPEED RAIL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 25 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legislators reacted along party lines at a
public hearing in the Legislative Yuan Friday on whether the
government should continue to invest in Taiwan's first high speed
rail project.
</P>
<P>
At the hearing sponsored by a sub-group in the legislature to
promote financial bills, legislators from the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) said the high speed rail is a national
infrastructure project in which the government should continue to
invest.
</P>
<P>
Legislators from the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and the People
First Party (PFP), however, said the cost-overrun project should try
other means to secure capital or borrow from the government. They
advised against continued investment in the project lest it create
too much risk for the government.
</P>
<P>
Ho Nuan-hsuan, director-general of the Bureau of Taiwan High
Speed Rail, and Liu Kuo-chi, president of the Taiwan High Speed Rail
Corp. (THSRC), also said in the hearing that the project, which links
Taipei in the north and Kaohsiung in the south, is a major
infrastructure project that the government originally planned to build
itself, but the Legislative Yuan later passed a resolution that it
would be done according to the BOT (build-operate-transfer) model,
they said.
</P>
<P>
The government investment should be seen in the light that the
government supports its own policy, they added.
</P>
<P>
PFP legislators Christina Y. Liu and Chou Hsi-wei said the
government's investment in the project has high "moral" risk and
claimed that the political price has become the priority concern of
the government,
</P>
<P>
In addition, they claimed that the government took on too much
risk when signing the contract with the THSRC in the first place. The
company should have used other means to solicit investment, they
said.
</P>
<P>
But DPP legislators Julian Kuo, Kao Chi-peng and Huang Wei-tze
noted that the project is still under construction and that it is
mere speculation to conclude that it will lose money.
</P>
<P>
The legislature should let state-owned enterprises decide on
their own whether to invest in the project and state-controlled
banks' investment in the project should not be seen as government
subsidies, they said.
</P>
<P>
Ho and Liu expressed the hope that the government will continue
to invest in the project so that the 345-km railway can become
operational this October as scheduled.

U.S. REMAINS SUPPORTIVE OF TAIWAN'S WHO BID: TAIWAN OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  March 24 (CNA)
(By Wennie Chi, Jorge Liu and Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States, which explicitly
expressed its support for Taiwan's bid to join the World Health
Organization (WHO) last year, will remain supportive of the cause
this year, Republic of China representative to the United States
David Ta-wei Lee said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lee made the remarks in response to reports suggesting that
Washington intends to "punish" China for enacting the Anti-Secession
Law targeting Taiwan and to "make up for" Taiwan by supporting its
WHO bid.
</P>
<P>
In a regular news briefing with the Chinese-language media in
Washington, Lee said U.S. government officials have never mentioned
the word "punish" during his consultations with the administration of
President George W. Bush on the Anti-Secession Law.
</P>
<P>
Lee would not disclose details of the consultations but said
Washington is very concerned about the enactment of the law and has
taken a tough and firm stand toward China's move.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the United States will continue to throw its support
behind Taiwan's bid to enter the WHO this year like it did last year.
</P>
<P>
According to Lee, Washington has expressed its approval of
President Chen Shui-bian's 10-point agreement reached with opposition
People First Party Chairman James Soong Feb. 24.
</P>
<P>
In the agreement, Chen reaffirmed his "five-noes" commitment that
during his term he will not declare independence for Taiwan, will not
change the official name of the country, will not include the
"state-to-state" theory in the Constitution, will not promote a
referendum to change the cross-Taiwan Strait status quo and will not
abolish the Guidelines for National Unification and the National
Unification Council.
</P>
<P>
Lee said he has sensed an obvious change in the United States'
attitude toward Taiwan since December last year.
</P>

While Washington is very unhappy with China's wilful move to
enact the Anti-Secession Law to change the cross-strait status quo
unilaterally, it has commended the rational manner that Taiwan has
adopted in dealing with the situation, Lee said.

NOBEL LAUREATE POET TO SPEAK AT COLLOQUIUM IN TAINAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Tainan  City,  southern  Taiwan,   March  25  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
West Indian
dramatist and poet Derek Walcott, winner of the 1992 Nobel Prize in
Literature, is expected to appear at a colloquium to be held in
Tainan City Sunday, the National Museum of Taiwanese Literature
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Walcott, who was born in Castries, St. Lucia in 1930 to a British
father and a West Indian mother, will attend the colloquium titled:
Poetry, Language and Identity, to be sponsored by the National Museum
of Taiwanese Literature with various local poets, academics and
literati also taking part.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that Walcott, who skillfully fuses folk island
culture with the classical and avant-garde in his poems, will be
inspirational to Taiwan's literary circles at a time when Taiwan is
enthusiastically promoting maritime culture, a museum spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Walcott, who from the age of eight envisaged becoming a poet,
published his first poem at 14 and had his first verse collection
printed by the time he was 18.
</P>
<P>
Walcott, who divides his time between the United States and
Trinidad, exalts in the English language with his meticulously honed
poems and evocative dramas, while also using a rich mix of Latin,
French and Trinidadian patois.
</P>
<P>
In addition to poems and verse, Walcott also writes plays and
epic poems. His 1990 epic poem Omeros, which echoes Homer's Iliad and
Odyssey as it examines the Caribbean's colonial past and complex
present, won him the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Often focusing on West Indian folk traditions, Walcott's plays
include Dream on Monkey Mountain (1970), The Joker of Seville (1975),
A Branch of the Blue Nile (1986), while his verse collections include
In a Green Night (1962), the autobiographical Another Life (1973),
Sea Grapes (1976) and Midsummer (1984).
</P>
<P>
Prof. Xi Mi from the University of California in Los Angeles will
be the host of the colloquium, while Taiwan poets Lee Kuei-hsien and
Lee Min-yung, as well as professor Tseng Chen-chen of National Dong
Hwa University and Lin Jui-ming, director of the National Museum of
Taiwanese Literature, will conduct dialogues with Walcott, according
to the museum spokesman.

EVERY MARCHER COUNTS IN 326 PROTEST: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 25 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Friday that every
marcher counts in Saturday's demonstration against China's
Anti-Secession Law.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the remarks as he answered questions during a general
interpellation session at the Legislative Yuan in which Yang Li-huang
of the opposition Kuomintang questioned the approach of Hsieh and
other government officials taking to the streets.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh, who has over the last few days been urging government
employees to take part in the 326 March for Democracy and Peace
sponsored by the Taiwan Democratic Alliance for Peace, said that his
own participation is to be with the people, adding that he has no
intention of leading the march or walking at the front.
</P>
<P>
But he said that as a member of Taiwan society, he believes that
the more people who take part, the more weight will be lent to the
activity, which will translate into additional effect
internationally.
</P>
<P>
He said that a more galvanized people's will will allow foreign
countries to see that the Taiwan people really care about the threat
posed by China and that their resolve to pursue democracy and peace
is a model for the world.
</P>
<P>
Responding to Yang's sarcastic remark that if marching was so
effective, the government might as well appropriate budget to have
marches all year round, the premier said that the world does not pay
attention to Taiwan or listen to what it says all year round.
</P>
<P>
The premier stressed that not all activities should be protests,
saying that government officials should not take to the streets over
such issues as internal problems.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that Taiwan has been talking without people listening
for years, the premier said that "now that the passage of China's
Anti-Session Law has aroused world attention and provides a rare
forum for Taiwan to speak out, the country should seize the
opportunity March 26."

PRESIDENT PINS HIGH HOPES TO TAIWAN'S AGRICULTURE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 25 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian urged Taiwan's
agriculture sector Friday to engage in innovation and sustainable
progress to "help the country reach further into the international
community and bring Taiwan to the world."
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while addressing the opening ceremony of
the 2005 Taiwan International Orchid Exhibition that will run through
April 10 at an orchid bio-tech park in southern Tainan County.
</P>
<P>
Chen expressed the hope that Taiwan's fine quality orchids will
break into more foreign markets and he revealed that the
Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture has reached an agreement with
China Airlines to decorate the cabins of its new passenger planes
with orchid prints as means of presenting the flowers to the rest of
the world.
</P>
<P>
Although many are concerned about future developments in Taiwan's
agriculture since the country entered the World Trade Organization in
January 2002, Chen said there is clear proof that although the
industry has sustained difficulties, it is heading into a brighter
future.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the industry yielded NT$377 billion (about US$12
billion) in production value last year, up by 7 percent over the 2003
level. Export values amounted to US$3.52 billion, an increase of 11.7
percent year on year, he said.
</P>
<P>
More than 20,000 pots of orchids are on display at the
exhibition, with international seminars and a world competition on
the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
Participants from 16 countries and areas, including Australia,
France, Indonesia, Holland, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand and the United States
will vie for the top prize in the competition.

TAIWAN PEOPLE TO DETERMINE THEIR FUTURE: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  March 25 (CNA)
(By Wennie Chi and Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Republic of China Premier Frank Hsieh
said Friday that a large-scale rally scheduled for Saturday in Taiwan
against China's Anti-Secession Law will show the world that "it is
the people of Taiwan who will determine their future, not the
unelected leaders in Beijing."
</P>
<P>
"The demonstrators will mobilize to oppose the idea that China
has a 'right' to use force to subjugate the people of Taiwan -- and
they will protest the notion that some 2,900 unelected and
unaccountable Chinese 'parliamentarians' have the right to determine
the future of the 23 million people of Taiwan, " Hsieh says in an
article titled "Taiwan's Right to Freedom" printed in the Washington
Post.
</P>
<P>
At least 1 million people are expected to turn out for the 326
March for Democracy and Peace to be held Saturday in Taipei.
President Chen Shui-bian and Hsieh have both decided to participate
in the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
According to Hsieh, it is perplexing that China has passed a law
that authorizes the use of force against Taiwan after cross-Taiwan
Strait relations were improving.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Hsieh says, the process by which the Anti-Secession
Law was passed reflects the sharp contrast between China's
dictatorship and Taiwan's vibrant democracy.
</P>
<P>
Beijing was making a "flawed" analogy when it tried to justify
the law by claiming a parallel to the U.S. Civil War and Abraham
Lincoln's effort to forcibly preserve the Union, Hsieh says.
</P>
<P>
"It refers to a Taiwan that has never been a part of, or under
the sovereign control of, the People's Republic of China. And it
ignores the most basic point: Lincoln wanted to preserve the Union in
the name of freedom, not to deny it," he says.
</P>
<P>
While remarkable progress has been seen in the democratic
development in East Asia over the past two decades, the region's two
remaining one-party dictatorships -- China and North Korea -- pose a
serious threat to regional security, he points out.
</P>
<P>
The premier calls the international community's attention to the
fact that China "continues to stifle the democratic aspirations of
its own people and to threaten Taiwan's democracy with military
force."
</P>
<P>
"Unless the great democracies of the world say this behavior is
not tolerable, we will only be inviting Beijing to believe it is," he
concludes.

Around 64 percent of the respondents agreed to the idea that
joining a protest march is a way of expressing public opinion, with
more than half of them viewing a protest march as a display of
"discontent, concern and support" over issues in that order, the poll
found. Some 46 percent of them admitted to having taken part in a

GLOBAL ECONOMY WILL NOT SLOW DOWN DESPITE SURGING OIL PRICES: TIER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 25 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rising oil prices are not expected to
cause a global economic recession because the economic development of
most countries around the world is supported by the service industry,
researchers of the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER)
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, international oil prices, which have been estimated to
stay at a high range of US$45-US$55 per barrel this year, are not
expected to fall much since global oil demand has grown faster than
expected due to increasing economic growth in China and the United
States, as well as global weather changes, according to TIER.
</P>
<P>
The report cites an International Energy Agency decision March 11
to enlarge its assessment of the world's annual crude oil demand by
2.2 percent. It also mentions the fact that oil suppliers will not
dump stockpiles in the market since there are only limited oil
reserves.
</P>
<P>
In the latest trading in New York, the price of light sweet crude
oil for delivery in May soared US$1.03 to US$54.84 per barrel after a
fatal blast at the British Petroleum Company's biggest oil refinery
in the United States, which took lives of at least 15 people and
injured some 100.
</P>
<P>
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
has assessed that if crude oil prices stay at the level of US$50 per
barrel, the global economic growth rate will be lower by 0.5
percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
A similar assessment by the International Monetary Fund also
shows that every US$5-per-barrel growth in international oil prices
will bring down the global economic growth by 0.3 percentage points.

Now that El Salvador and Guatemala have
spoken out against China's Anti-Secession Law, the parliamentary
speakers of Taiwan's other Central American allies are expected to
release a joint statement against the law during their next meeting
in April, Vice President Annette Lu said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lu, who returned a day earlier from an official visit to El
Salvador and Guatemala, said her trip has consolidated the country's
friendship with its two allies, has upheld justice for Taiwan, has
expanded opportunities for Taiwan industries and has highlighted what
she described as the "soft emergence" of Taiwan. She did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Lu noted that China has continued its diplomatic suppression of
Taiwan and has tried to lure away the island's allies in Central
America.
</P>
<P>
The trip successfully "stopped" the financial temptation offered
by Beijing to Taiwan's allies, Lu claimed.
</P>
<P>
In what Lu called the other two achievements of her trip,
Salvadoran Vice President Ana Vilma de Escobar will visit Taiwan in
April to discuss details of setting up a "Taiwan Park" in her
country, while Guatemalan President Oscar Berger will visit in August
to sign a Free Trade Agreement with Taiwan and attend the
inauguration of the Democratic Pacific Union.

SECURITY OFFICIALS DISCIPLINED OVER 319 SHOOTING
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Seven senior security officials, including
Tsai Chao-ming, the former chief of the National Security Bureau
(NSB) and Maj. Gen. Chen Tsai-fu, the former chief-de-camp of
President Chen Shui-bian, were disciplined Friday for failing to
protect him in last year's March 19 shooting.
</P>
<P>
Tsai was given a warning, the lightest kind of discipline, while
Chen was dismissed from his job and prohibited for one year from
serving as government employee, according to a decision of the
Committee on the Discipline of Public Functionaries which metes out
punishment to government employees who fail in their duty.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shen Tsai-tien, former vice chief-de-camp for Chen,
was demoted two ranks, while the police chief of Tainan City where
the shooting took place was demoted by one rank.
</P>
<P>
Three other NSC officials who were in charge of the president's
personal security were reprimanded twice.
</P>
<P>
They were seven of eight security officials referred to the
discipline committee for possible punishment by the Control Yuan in
July 2004 for failing to provide proper security for the president.
Chen was grazed in the attempted assassination on the eve
of the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The only one spared by the committee is a senior police officer
from the National Police Administration.
</P>
<P>
The Control Yuan said the officials failed to ask the president
to wear a bullet-proof vest during a campaign parade before the
shooting took place, and failed to surround the president's motorcade
with bodyguards during the campaign parade, resulting in the
bodyguards being unable to react quickly to the shooting.
</P>
<P>
Tsai Chao-ming, Chen Tsai-fu and Shen Tsai-tien were removed from
their jobs after the shooting, pending the investigation.
</P>
<P>
The shooting has been at the center of a lingering political
dispute between Chen and his political rivals, who claim that it was
staged to help Chen win re-election.

PRESIDENT URGES PUBLIC TO SPEAK OUT AGAINST ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Kaohsiung,  March 25 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Friday
that oppressed people should speak out in a democratic, peaceful
manner to remind the world not to pamper oppressors.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks in a speech delivered at the opening of the
2005 World Poetry Festival in the southern port city of Kaohsiung.
</P>
<P>
His call for "speaking out" came on the eve of a planned massive
rally in Taipei to protest China's recent enactment of its
Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen read a poem written in 1945 by local poet Chi Hsuen that
features relations between sound and existence to accentuate the need
to speak out against Beijing's legislation that codifies the use of
force against Taiwan should the island pursue formal independence.
</P>
<P>
"Just as the poem says that sound proves existence, those who are
oppressed or mistreated should speak out and remind the world of the
perils of coddling oppressors. If we keep silence or sit idly by, the
oppressors will become ever stronger and more aggressive," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the 326 March for Democracy and Peace is aimed at
voicing opposition to the idea that China has a "right" to use force
to subjugate the people of Taiwan and protesting the notion that some
2,900 unelected and unaccountable Chinese "parliamentarians" have the
right to determine the future of the 23 million people of Taiwan,
Chen urged local people to join the parade to make Taiwan's voice
heard around the world.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his gratitude for more than 100 poets from 17
countries on six continents who have made the long journey to
Kaohsiung to take part in the poetry festival and share their
literary achievements with local people.
</P>
<P>
Praising poetry as beautiful sound from the depth of the human
soul, Chen said poetry is a beautiful language shared by all human
beings without the constraints of borders or ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
Chen further said Taiwan has diverse ethnic groups who have
created a myriad of poems and lyrical songs in different styles over
the centuries.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome with great modesty the arrival of noted poets from
around the world to offer their poetic visions, lyrical perspectives
and aesthetic experiences, " Chen said, adding he believes that the
ongoing World Poetry Festival will bring rich inspiration to local
poets and add to the diversity of Taiwan's literary creations.
</P>
<P>
With a theme of "Sea and Land in Harmony, Poetic Minds in
Interflow, " the 2005 World Poetry Festival in Kaohsiung will run
through March 27.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day period, poets from home and abroad will
exchange their insights and creative experiences as well as recite
their own poems and discuss topics related to literary developments.
</P>
<P>
Among the participants is Derek Walcott, a Saint Lucia dramatist
and poet who won the 1992 Nobel Prize in literature. Other
participants come from India, Bangladesh, Mexico, Nigeria, Mongolia,
Romania, the United States and Japan.

MAC CHIEF SEES NO IMMINENT CRISIS OF CROSS-STRAIT MILITARY CONFLICT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Hong Kong,  March 25 (CNA)
(By Lu Chien-hui and Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The possibility of a military conflict
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait breaking out in the near
future is nil, Taiwan's top mainland policy planner said in a recent
interview with a Hong Kong daily published Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu said in the interview
with the Hong Kong Economic Journal that the Republic of China's
armed forces have consistently kept a close watch on military
activities on the other side of the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Since China's ceremonial legislature, the National People's
Congress, passed the Anti-Secession Law March 14, Wu said, the
People's Liberation Army has not conducted any abnormal activities.
Against this backdrop, Wu said, he sees no immediate potential for a
cross-strait military conflict.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Wu said, the possibility continues to grow because
of Beijing's deployment of more than 700 ballistic missiles along its
southeastern coast opposite Taiwan. Worse still, he added, the number
of China's missiles targeting Taiwan will further increase to 800 by
the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
Asked why Taiwan has reacted strongly to Beijing's Anti-Secession
Law that codifies the use of "non-peaceful means" against Taiwan, Wu
said Taiwan's rage lies in China's erroneous premise for using brute
force.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have been
independent of each other since 1949, Wu said the term
"anti-secession" seemingly implies that the two sides are united at
present and, therefore, China could "punish" Taiwan at will.
</P>
<P>
China's ill-intentioned and arbitrary legislation is unacceptable
to democratic and pluralistic Taiwan because it is tantamount to
restricting Taiwan people's freedom of choice.
</P>
<P>
By authorizing its Central Military Commission to use
non-peaceful means to stop Taiwan from declaring independence, Wu
went on, the legislation is actually a war bill that completely runs
against the United Nations charter.
</P>
<P>
As for Taiwan's response measures, Wu said ultimately, national
interests are the top concern and formulating guidelines for counter-
strategies.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, the ROC government will not promote the
legislation of an anti-invasion bill or an anti-aggression bill. The
government will also refrain from launching a "defensive referendum"
to counter Beijing's legislation.
</P>
<P>
"We must exercise self-restraint and be a responsible member of
the international community, " Wu said, adding that world news media
has so far published more than 2,000 articles, editorials and
commentaries in support of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Wu said, more than one million Taiwan people will
take to the streets to voice their strong opposition to the
Anti-Secession Law.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the ROC government will adopt a cautious and prudent
attitude to cope with the situation in the wake of Beijing's new
legislation.

GOVERNMENT WILL CONTINUE TO PROMOTE DIRECT CROSS-STRAIT TRANSPORT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 25 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government will continue to promote
the opening of direct cross-Taiwan Strait transportation links,
Premier Frank Hsieh said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Fielding questions raised by lawmakers at an interpellation
session of the Legislative Yuan, Hsieh said that the government has
completed an assessment on the cross-strait transport links.
</P>
<P>
Basically, he said, it is necessary to hold consultations between
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait on the opening of the direct
cross-strait transport links, which he said should be based on the
cross-strait charter flight services for this past year's lunar new
year holiday.
</P>
<P>
The premier noted, however, that the government should take
Taiwan people's feeling into consideration when dealing with the
cross-strait issue in the wake of China's recent enactment of its
Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
This is the reason why there were no cross-strait talks on the
issue recently, he explained, adding that the government will
continue to promote faster and more convenient cross-strait
transportation in the long run.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh feels that the two sides should hold peaceful talks on
matters of mutual concern and should increase bilateral exchanges,
making China's development positive and beneficial for Taiwan, while
making experiences of Taiwan's democratization part of the Chinese
people's lifestyle and contributive to their progress.
</P>
<P>
Given that the two sides have been becoming more interdependent
economically, Hsieh stressed that Taiwan should not make the other
side of the Strait an enemy, although it has to protest against
China's moves that hurt Taiwan's rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan should use its geographic advantages of being located near
China to participate in regional development and to avoid being
marginalized, he added.

<P>
Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Joseph
Wu said Friday he will take part in the "326" March for Democracy and
Peace in Taipei Saturday to protest China's so-called anti-secession
law against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The nation's top mainland policy planner said he will be present
throughout the whole event. Nevertheless, he will not reveal which
parade route he will take. 
</P>
<P>
"Premier Frank Hsieh said earlier this week that government
employees can join the March 26 street parade against the
anti-secession law, but should keep a low profile. Therefore, I
decide to mingle with ordinary citizens and take part in this
democratic extravaganza at a suitable location," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
He further said the significance of the "326" march lies in the
fact that the event provides the people of Taiwan an opportunity to
show the world their opposition to Beijing's ill-intentioned law that
authorizes the use of non-peaceful means against Taiwan as well as
their aspiration for peace and democracy.
</P>
<P>
"Democracy and peace are the ultimate goal of the march," Wu
said, adding that if the march can really draw the participation of 1
million people, the international community then can fully understand
Taiwan people's true desires.
</P>
<P>
More than 1 million people are expected to march toward the
square in front of the Presidential Office in downtown Taipei from 10
different locations in Taipei City and Taipei County.

TAIPEI BRACES FOR PROTEST WITH EXPECTED RECORD TURNOUT

<P>
With more than one million people expected
to turn out in Taiwan for Saturday's protest against China's
Anti-Secession Law, organizers are taking pains Friday to ensure the
event is a success.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Democratic Alliance for Peace, which is organizing the
protest, is an umbrella group consists of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party, the Taiwan Solidarity Union and others. It said
Friday that more than 5,000 tour buses will pull into Taipei from
around the island Saturday, raising the possibility of traffic jams
and parking problems.
</P>
<P>
The buses will drop off their passengers at 30 different
locations around the city, and then drive to parking lots near the
square in front of the Presidential Office where the marchers will
eventually meet up.
</P>
<P>
In order to minimize air pollution, the city's environmental
protection officials asked the drivers Friday not to keep their buses
running while they are parked.
</P>
<P>
The protesters will march toward the square in front of the
Presidential Office following 10 different routes. The routes have a
combined length of more than 40 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
In order to monitor the speed of the marchers, each route will be
led by a car equipped with a global positioning system.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian and his family will join the march at
some point, ensuring that security details will have their hands
full.
</P>
<P>
News reports Friday said that seven security officials were
disciplined for allowing the president and vice president to be shot
last year the day before the presidential election. Punishments were
said to have been meted out to the former National Security Bureau
chief and the president's former aide-de-camp, among others.
</P>
<P>
Adding to the security headache is the fact that many other
high-ranking government officials will also march Saturday, from
Premier Frank Hsieh on down. With so many routes and so many people
involved, officials say that keeping the high-profile marchers safe
will be a challenge, even for experienced security officials.
</P>
<P>
To keep things running smoothly, the organizers have recruited an
army of volunteers to help ensure that everything proceeds in a
peaceful manner.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen supply stations will be set up along the 10 routes to
provide protestors with bottled water, small flags, and badges.
Twenty thousand bottles of water have been ordered by the organizers
-- one bottle for every five people expected to march.
</P>
<P>
The organizer will also have 1,500 mobile toilets for the
expected one million protesters, or one toilet for every 666 persons.
</P>
<P>
Instead of listening to politicians' speeches as in the past, the
protesters will sing several songs at the square in front of the
Presidential Office, and break up at about 5 p.m. How a million
people will disperse without gridlock is something that organizers
say will work itself out.
</P>
<P>
Organizers will have big posters pointing the way to tour buses,
and they said that they hoped that the last protesters will leave the
square for home an hour and a half after the end of the march.

Democracy, peace and security of Taiwan --
the theme of a protest to be staged on March 26 -- are the
common desires of the people in Taiwan, President Chen Shui-bian said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Receiving South Korean scholar Kim Young-oak, founder of the

Chen said Taiwan is a diversified society with people of
different origins. Except for the aborigines, Taiwanese
immigrated to the island from different places at different times.

No matter when they arrived in Taiwan, no matter whether they
call it the Republic of China or Taiwan, Chen said, they had a common
compassion for the island.

All the differences among them notwithstanding, Chen said
democracy, peace and security is their common desire, which unites
them closely together.

by joining a "flash mob" to demonstrate displeasure over China's
enactment of the Anti-Secession Law.

provides Beijing with a legal basis to use "non-peaceful means"
against Taiwan if it deems the nation to be moving toward
independence.

One of the flash mobbers sent the premier an e-mail Thursday

DPP URGES PARTICIPATION IN MARCH IRRESPECTIVE OF PARTY AFFILIATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 26 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Everyone should come out in support of
Taiwan against China's Anti-Secession Law regardless of party
affiliation, a legislator from the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) urged Saturday.
</P>
<P>
William C. D. Lai, DPP caucus whip in the legislature, said that
different parties can have different views at home, but they should
stand united when representing Taiwan to the foreign community.
</P>
<P>
"With the recent enactment of the Anti-Secession Law in China,
which stipulates that Taiwan is a part of the People's Republic of
China, Beijing could use non-peaceful means against the island if
Taiwan does not agree," Lai said.
</P>
<P>
He regretted that the opposition parties have been unwilling to
take part in the march, especially since it is a critical time to
take concerted action against China.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chieh, KMT caucus whip in the legislature of the largest
opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), said Saturday that the march
falls into China's trap and he knows of no KMT legislators who will
take part in the march.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that Taiwan is a sovereign, independent state, and
China's enactment of any law is irrelevant to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He said that the participation of President Chen Shui-bian and
Premier Frank Hsieh in the march will require thousands of military
and policemen for their protection, which is "a squandering of
national resources." 

</P>
<P>
In response to Chen's remarks, Lai said that it is baffling for
the KMT to use the pretext of China bullying Taiwan to explain their
reasons for not participating.
</P>
<P>
Lai said he never suspected to see the KMT in league with the
Chinese authorities, noting that KMT Chairman Lien Chan said before
that the Anti-Secession Law is targeting a few pro-independent
activists, and now the KMT is saying that it doesn't matter that
Beijing passed the law.
</P>
<P>
The "326 March for Democracy and Peace" was organized by the
Taiwan Democratic Alliance for Peace, an umbrella group consists of
the DPP, the Taiwan Solidarity Union and others.
</P>
<P>
All 89 DPP legislators have pulled out all stops to mobilize the
people, and the party estimates that at least 200,000 people from
around the island will come to Taipei, Lai said.
</P>
<P>
But they will only form the basis of the participants in the
afternoon, Lai said, adding that he is confident that one million
will turn out to speak out for Taiwan and convey their will that they
are vehemently opposed to the Anti-Secession Law.
</P>
<P>
To make the march take on the flair of a peaceful carnival, the
DPP legislators have taken pains to be creative.
</P>
<P>
Lai has prepared a lot of Taiwan fruits, including bananas and
guavas, and will perform skits during the march to satirize China for
taking a two-pronged approach -- approved the Anti-Secession Law on
the one hand and saying that it supports Taiwan fruits for export to
the mainland on the other.
</P>
<P>
Several female DPP legislators will distribute candy and cookies
along the marching routes, while Legislator Tang Pi-er will dress in
a costume printed with slogans in various languages to underscore
their opposition to the Anti-Secession Law.

<P>
The pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU) launched a signature drive in southern Tainan County on
Saturday for a proposal to hold a referendum on China's
Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The party proposed that a referendum be held on May 14 alongside
the elections for the ad hoc National Assembly to let the people vote
on "whether Taiwan agrees or disagrees with the Anti-Secession Law."
</P>
<P>
According to Tseng Hsin-chao, head of the TSU's Tainan County
branch, a lot of people in southern Taiwan are not able to
participate in the large-scale 326 March for Democracy and Peace
being held in Taipei because of transportation problems, and the
signature drive was organized to allow them to voice their protest at
the aggressive legislation.
</P>
<P>
Tseng said more than 1,000 people have signed to endorse the
proposed referendum as of Saturday noon.

Representatives from Taiwan groups and
associations in Japan went to the Chinese Embassy in Tokyo Saturday
to express their indignation at China's recent enactment of an
Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen representatives took part in the protest, with
Lin Yao-nan, who serves as an adviser to Taipei's Overseas
Chinese Affairs Commission, reading a protest letter.
</P>
<P>
Lin said that Taiwan has established a nation through
democratization with its president popularly elected. China's law is
nothing more than an excuse to try to swallow Taiwan, he said, adding
that the law has been met with derision from the people on Taiwan and
has been condemned by the international community.

In addition to the protest, more than 30 Taiwanese-Japanese

<P>
Members of over a dozen Taiwanese
groups in the great Washington, D.C. area will protest in front of
the Chinese Embassy Saturday against Beijing's enactment of the
Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Gaines Ho, president of the Formosan Association for Public
Affairs' D.C. Chapter, said on Friday that Taiwan expatriates in the
United States are expressing their opposition to the passage of the
law, which provides China with a legal basis to use "non- peaceful
means" against Taiwan if it deems the nation to be moving toward
independence.
</P>
<P>
The planned march in Washington, D.C. will take demonstrators
first to Capitol Hill, where they will speak about the rights of the
Taiwanese people and that Taiwan's future should be decided by the
people living in Taiwan, instead of the authoritarians in Beijing, in
a peaceful manner, according to the organizer.
</P>
<P>
Then, the demonstrators will head toward the Chinese Embassy on
Connecticut Avenue to protest against Beijing's attempt to annex
Taiwan, Ho said.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen groups of Taiwan expatriates from the East Coast have
signed up for the march, which coincides with the massive March 26
protest rally in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on the West Coast, more than 800 Taiwan expatriates in
Los Angeles, Orange County, Riverside and San Diego in California
gathered at a square in front of Los Angeles City Hall Friday, where
they began an "anti-Anti-Secession Law" march around the downtown
area.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators waved national flags of the Republic of China
and the United States, as well as flags of Taiwan's ruling Democratic
Progressive Party, raised banners reading "Anti-Secession is a Bad
Law, " "Taiwan, China; One Country, One Side, " and "Anti-Aggression,
Protect Taiwan, " and shouted other slogans. They urged people in the
U.S. to condemn the "war-oriented" law.

326 MARCH NOT TO HAVE LONG-TERM EFFECT ON TAIWAN SHARES: ANALYSTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 26 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The massive march protest Saturday in
Taipei against Beijing's Anti-Secession Law -- the largest in
Taiwan's history -- should not have a negative impact on Taiwan
shares over the long term, market analysts said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Market observers said share prices on the Taiwan Stock Exchange
(TAIEX) should not be too much affected Monday, as the peaceful
protest marks an end of a string of complications to Beijing's
enactment of the law March 14 against Taiwan independence.
</P>
<P>
Rather than political factors, recent oil price surges on the
global market and fluctuating currency exchange rates will create
more effects on the market's performance at a time when the U.S.
again lifted its interest rates Tuesday and when U.S. stocks have
been at relatively low levels in recent days, they pointed out.
</P>
<P>
As foreign hot money has showed signs of flowing to the United
States from Taiwan due to the U.S. Federal Reserve recent rate hikes,
they predicted that Taiwan stocks may come under increased selling
pressure over the short term.
</P>
<P>
Although room will be limited for the TAIEX to perform
extraordinarily for the coming low season in the second quarter, they
are confident that the market will eventually return to look to
economic fundamentals on the grounds that political elements are
usually passing phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
They opined that the Saturday protest will not have a long-term
impact on the domestic bourse and flow-on effects should be fully and
quickly digested in the wake of the event owing to a political
reconciliation atmosphere in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Investors can temporarily sit on the sidelines, but they do not
have to be wholly pessimistic about Taiwan shares, they suggested.
</P>
<P>
However, in the face of rising oil costs, shares of
energy-intensive traditional businesses, such as plastics, synthetic
rubber, steel and metal industries, will be hit harder over the mid-
and long-term, they said, adding that the present situation will be
harder for small businesses to sustain than large companies.
</P>
<P>
Continued soaring oil prices will increase production costs for
businesses and fuel product prices, a development that may force
consumers to cut spending and could drag down economic growth, they
warned.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) , in
conjunction with the Bureau of Foreign Trade and Taiwan External
Trade Development Council, has formed an overseas purchase group to
help minimize operating pressure on Taiwan's small businesses in
light of rising raw-material prices, taking advantage of a stronger
new Taiwan dollar.
</P>
<P>
Initially, the MOEA is planning to send the mission to South
Africa, Brazil, Russia and Ukraine to procure prime raw materials to
meet local demand.

Science-based Industrial Park (HSIP) in northern Taiwan called
Saturday for rapport with mainland China, saying that it is vital for
both sides to upgrade their technologies.
</P>
<P>
Tung Chao-chin, chairman of a federation composed of companies
based in the hi-tech park, said that peace and security across the
Taiwan Strait is a conduit for continued hi-tech development on both
sides.
</P>
<P>
Both sides of the Strait will be hurt if tensions continue to
mount, he said, adding that Taiwan hi-tech businesses long for sound
government policy and goodwill from both sides to maintain peace in
the region.
</P>
<P>
That China has become one of the world's economic powerhouses is
clear and more and more foreign enterprises are seeking to expand
into its market, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen Hsi-meng, chairman of an IC design company operating in the
park, viewed cross-strait peace as the key gauge for Taiwan companies
wishing to draw up their next-step market deployment strategies and
as a major reference for foreign businesses to assess long-term
investment potential in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Should cross-strait stability become uncertain, the pace of
Taiwan companies "going west" will diminish and foreign enterprises
could begin to worry, Chen said. On the other hand, a peaceful
cross-strait relationship will help attract a much greater amount of
foreign capital to Taiwan, he added.
</P>
<P>
Their remarks came shortly before a large demonstration later the
same day in Taipei to protest Beijing's Anti-Secession Law aimed at
curbing Taiwan independence.
</P>
<P>
The HSIP, Taiwan's most representative facility of its kind,
houses only hi-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
Cross-strait ties have remained fragile for some time since late
last year after perceptions that Taiwan was leaning toward
independence by making such moves as wanting to change the official
title of the Republic of China to Taiwan and writing a new
constitution.
</P>
<P>
The situation became even more sensitive recently for the
high-tech sector after United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC) was
charged by prosecutors last month with illegally investing in He Jian
Technology -- a mainland-based wafer plant in Suzhou.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan-based UMC is the world's second-largest chipmaker on a
contract basis.

OVERSEAS CHINESE IN PANAMA OPPOSE CHINA'S ANTI-SECESSION LAW

<TEXT>
<P>
Representatives of overseas Chinese and
Taiwanese groups issued a joint statement Friday in Panama to express
their opposition to China's recently enacted Anti-Secession Law
targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The statement pointed out that China's legislation is trying to
change unilaterally the cross-Taiwan Strait status quo and to provide
Beijing authorities a legal basis for invading Taiwan by force.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have been two
different countries since 1949, it argued, cross-strait issues are
absolutely not China's internal affair.
</P>
<P>
The future of the Republic of China should not be decided by any
individuals or political parties, but all own citizens, it stressed.

<P>
About 200 Hong Kong people marched from
Victoria Park in Causeway Bay to China's joint liaison office in Hong
Kong Friday to protest Beijing's enactment of the Anti-Secession Law.
</P>
<P>
The protest was timed to coincide with a similar protest in
Taipei, Taiwan to show Hong Kong people's solidarity with the Taiwan
people, said an organizer.
</P>
<P>
He said the protesters oppose the Anti-Secession Law because it
threatens to use force against Taiwan, which runs counter to the
international trend of solving disputes by peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
The protestors had no sympathy for Taiwan independence but
believed the opinion of Taiwan people should be respected when it
comes to the unification of the mainland and Taiwan, the organizer
went on.
</P>
<P>
The marchers waved posters and shouted slogans opposing the
Anti-Secession Law along the way to China's liaison office.

DEMONSTRATION ENDS WITH PRAYER FOR PEACE ACROSS THE TAIWAN STRAIT

(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than one million protesters who
gathered in Taipei to show their resentment towards Beijing's
Anti-Secession Law topped their protest off with a prayer for peace.
</P>
<P>
The prayer, which was read out by an emcee through the public
address system at the end of the protest, said the protesters
gathered had one common desire: to safeguard democracy, ensure peace
and protect Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The prayer read, "We treasure democracy and thereby oppose
China's interference with Taiwan's internal affairs, which is the
opposite of democracy. We treasure peace and thereby oppose Chinese
military threats against Taiwan, which is the opposite of peace."
</P>
<P>
"China should learn what democracy and peace are -- universal
values. China should also listen to the voices of the people of
Taiwan"
</P>
<P>
Noting that their ancestors braved dangers to move to the island
for freedom and had forged an epirit de corps through common
suffering and hardships, the prayer said Taiwanese will be helped by
their ancestors in their fight to preserve democracy and peace.
</P>
<P>
"We have just broken free from the shackles of an authoritarian
regime, we will never allow ourselves to be shackled by another
authoritarian regime."
</P>
<P>
"We will never give up the right to determine our own future, it
is a right neither we nor our offspring will give up.
</P>
<P>
"Today we pray for not only peace for Taiwan, but also peace for
the world. We hope the 1.3 billion friendly people of China can enjoy
the same democracy, liberty and freedom from fear as we do. We hate
war, we love peace; this is the 23 million Taiwan people's
enthusiastic desire. We hope people with like minds will join us in
our pray. May God bless Taiwan, both its people and its land, " the
prayer ended.

Opposition People First Party (PFP)
officials Saturday urged the government to put aside emotions and
deal with cross-Taiwan Strait issues in a peaceful, rational and
neutral manner after the large demonstration against China's
Anti-Secession Law was over.

According to the party's spokesman, Hsieh Kung-ping, PFP Chairman

No PFP member was to have taken part in the rally asking for

<P>
Among the protesters were President Chen Shui-bian, Premier Frank
Hsieh and a number of other government officials.

MOST TAIWAN PEOPLE OPPOSED TO ANTI-SECESSION LAW: DPP
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   March  26  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu )
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The large turn out at Saturday's
demonstration showed the common resolve of the people of Taiwan
against China's Anti-Secession Law, an executive member of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said.
</P>
<P>
The law, enacted by Beijing earlier this month, authorizes the
use of "non-peaceful means" against Taiwan under certain
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Chen Wen-chan, director of the DPP department of culture and
information, said that Taiwan is a society with democracy and
freedoms. In the face of the threat inherent in the new law, hundreds
of thousands of Taiwan people took to the streets to voice their
determination to defend their democracy and freedom, adding this is
the mainstream opinion of the public in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, senior advisor to the president Yeh Chu-lan reiterated
that the people of Taiwan will not compromise their stance on
defending their homeland.
</P>
<P>
No threat can force Taiwan to give up the fruits of its efforts
to promote a democratic system and seek freedom, Yeh said in her
address aimed at the four major ethnic groups on the island --
Australoid, Hakka, early settlers from southern China, and indigenous
peoples.
</P>
<P>
During the rally, a Hakka citizen from Hsinchu, Chen Yung-hung,
raised a sign with the characters for "Taiwan is no longer a colony
of any other country; Peace is the only road for Taiwan."

PROTEST UNLIKELY TO HALT ANTI-SECESSION LEGISLATION: OBSERVERS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 26 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite a large protest in Taipei against
China's Anti-Secession Law, Beijing is unlikely to halt its
legislation process to iron out more by-laws to step up its threats
against Taiwan, political observers said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Byron S. J. Weng, a national policy advisor to President Chen
Shui-bian and professor at National Chi Nan University, opined,
however, that Beijing should be more concerned about follow-up
reactions from the United States and European countries in the wake
of the March 26 protest in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Weng told CNA that it is still too early to talk about possible
effects of the march for Beijing, and he contented that it is
unlikely that Beijing will stop its legislation moves to further
oppress Taiwan. But he said that support from the U. S. and the
European Union (E. U.) should push Beijing to review its hegemonic
attitude toward Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lin Chong-pin, a former vice minister of national defense and a
vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council, echoed Weng by saying
that it is hard to judge whether the protest march would exact a
price in bilateral ties and claimed that Beijing would care more
about ensuing responses from the U. S. and the E. U. because Beijing
is dealing with the Taiwan issue through a global strategic
viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
Lin said that he does not think that Beijing would overreact to
the protest march in the near term, as protesters showed restraint.

MILLION-PERSON MARCH ENDS PEACEFULLY WITH CARNIVAL ATMOSPHERE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 26 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A million-person march to protest China's
Anti-Secession Law concluded peacefully in Taipei with the singing of
songs instead of emotionally charged rhetoric by political figures.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian showed up in front of the Presidential
Office at around 5: 15 p.m. as the giant mass of people surrounded
him with air batons banging and shouts of "protect democracy, love
peace and safeguard Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
The president later activated a "peace" ceremony in which a laser
beam that originated from a 20- meter tall balloon representing the
"pearl of democracy," which hit a red "sea urchin" -- another balloon
with numerous spikes representing the approximately 700 missiles
Beijing has deployed along its coastal provinces targeting Taiwan --
to show that the "beam of democracy can crush military might."
</P>
<P>
The president then led the crowd to join arms to symbolize
national solidarity. The laser beam also projected the words
"democracy, peace and safeguard Taiwan" on the Presidential Office
building.
</P>
<P>
The march ended after the president led the participants in
singing "She's Our Baby, " symbolizing that Taiwan is like the child
of all its inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
The "326 March for Democracy and Peace, " attracted the
participation of more than 500 civic groups and hundreds of thousands
of people from around the island.
</P>
<P>
The people, coming from every city and county and even from the
outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu, started to converge on Taipei
in the morning. The march began at around 2: 30 p.m. at 10 different
locations, and ended at a boulevard in front of the Presidential
Office.
</P>
<P>
President Chen, dressed casually, led his family through the
throng at 3:11 p.m. while some people struggled with security
personnel around the first family to try to shake hands with the
president. The president's two-year-old grandson, with demonstration
stickers on his cheeks, was also a big attraction. Chen and his
family arrived at Ketagalan Boulavard at around 3: 30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
Former President Lee Teng-hui led a large contingent from Daan
Forest Park. Accompanying him were such pro-independence activists as
former Presidential Office senior adviser Koo Kuan-min, former
Presidential Office advisers Huang Chao-tang and Kim Mei-lin, and
Huang Chu-wen, former head of the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), of
which Lee serves as its spiritual leader.
</P>
<P>
Several TSU legislators also stamped on pictures of the leaders
in Beijing to vent their anger with the new law.
</P>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh, Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman
Su Tseng-chang, Presidential Office Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun and
other ranking government officials were also on hand.
</P>
<P>
To vent their indignation at China for the passage of the
Anti-Secession Law March 14, some tried to burn the national flag of
the People's Republic of China, but security guards quickly doused
their enthusiasm with fire extinguishers. Protesters had to settle
for jumping up and down on the makeshift paper flags
</P>
<P>
Woman legislators from the DPP distributed "peace candy" and
"happiness cookies" along the march routes to wish the participants
peace and happiness.
</P>
<P>
Some tried more creative ways to underscore the cause by
decorating their dogs with flags and stickers and taking them along
the routes.
</P>
<P>
Another group comprised mostly of women's groups and TV talk show
hosts and hostess commandeered 706 kindergarten children, who were
made to put on paper fake bare buttocks with the words "leave" and
"peace" on them to symbolically moon China.
</P>
<P>
Ketagalan Boulevard took on a carnival-like atmosphere with a
band playing and several local performers singing songs about Taiwan
shortly after the first contingent arrived at around 3: 25 p.m.
Music took the place of political speeches ubiquitous in past
rallies.
</P>
<P>
A representative of the Taiwan Democratic Alliance for Peace, an
umbrella group consisting of the DPP, TSU and others, who sponsored
the march, then read an article on the goal of the march.
</P>
<P>
The sea of people then sang four songs symbolizing the four major
ethnic groups in Taiwan -- "Friends, " "She's Our Baby, " "The Nature
of the Hakka, " and "We're of a Family, " as well as a U.S. civil
rights movement key anthem, "We Shall Overcome."
</P>
<P>
DPP Chairman Su and the convener of Taiwan Democratic Alliance
for Peace then pushed five giant balloons symbolizing "opposition"
into the crowd. Vice President Annette Lu then hung banners
symbolizing prayers for peace on balloons that were then released
into the air.

IF BEIJING STILL CAN'T HEAR TAIWAN, THEN IT'S BEING CALLOUS: TSU

<TEXT>
<P>
If the leaders in Beijing still cannot
hear the voice of the people of Taiwan after Saturday's march, then
they are indeed insensitive to the level of being callous, a
legislator from the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Lo Chi-ming, TSU caucus whip in the Legislative Yuan, made the
remarks after hundreds of thousands from around the island and
outlying islands joined the march in Taipei to vent their anger at
China's passage of the Anti-Secession Law on March 14, which
authorizes the use of "non-peaceful means" against Taiwan under
certain circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Given that Taiwan people have attempted to make their feelings on
the issue known to the international community via the march, and let
the world hear the true voice of Taiwan, if Beijing leaders still
cannot hear this, then they are indeed insensitive, Lo said.
</P>
<P>
The TSU agreed that it was appropriate that President Chen
Shui-bian participate in the march, although it "regretted and felt
it is a pity," that he didn't give a speech.
</P>
<P>
"This is because a lot of people around the island couldn't join
the march, and they wanted to hear the president speak, " Lo
explained.

Answering journalists' questions on the sideline of the March 26

primary programs aimed at encouraging the private sector to chip in

Premier Frank Hsieh asked economic officials to do their utmost to
keep the economy growing at more than 4 percent, and keep the
unemployment rate below 4 percent in 2005.

As these programs have yet to be approved by the Cabinet, Wu said
it is not time to reveal them, but offering soft loans to private

TAIWAN EXPATS DEMONSTRATE AGAINST ANTI-SECESSION LAW IN LONDON
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
London,  March 26 (CNA)
(By N.K. Han and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 200 Taiwanese expatriates in the
United Kingdom gathered Saturday in front of the Chinese Embassy in
London to demonstrate against China's enactment of its Anti-Secession
Law, which threatens to use non-peaceful means to resolve the Taiwan
issue.
</P>
<P>
During the protest, the demonstrators, who came from six local
Taiwanese organizations and various cities, unfurled Republic of
China national flags and banners, and chanted slogans to protest
against China's newly enacted law.
</P>
<P>
They also gave an English-language statement to passers-by that
not only reminds the British government of China's 12 percent
increase in its military budget for this year and the more-than 700
missiles targeting Taiwan, but also notes that Beijing has enacted
the Anti-Secession Law threatening Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The statement also requests that the British people urge their
government not to support the European Union's plan to lift an arms
embargo on China.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is a sovereign and independent state as well as a free and
democratic country, it also says, adding that the future of the
island must be decided by its 23 million people.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that maintaining the current stability and status
quo in the Taiwan Strait is the consensus of the international
community, it further says that the Anti-Secession Law has
unilaterally changed the status quo and will endanger security and
peace in East Asia and the world.

GOVERNMENT URGED TO PREVENT 'AVALANCHE EFFECT'  AMONG TAISHANG
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 27 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government was urged Sunday to hammer
out countermeasures to protect the rights and interests of Taiwan
businessmen operating in China, known locally as "Taishang, " who are
predicted to bear the brunt of Beijing's recently enacted
Anti-Secession Law.
</P>
<P>
Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Trong Chai
called for the government to work out policies to prevent the
Taishang from being pushed to alienate Taiwan in business
considerations under the threat of the Anti-Secession Law.
</P>
<P>
Chai warned that an open letter issued Friday by Hsu Wen-lung,
founder and former chairman of Chi Mei Optoelectronics, saying that
he supports the Anti-Secession Law, might trigger an "avalanche
effect" among the Taishang community in China who will do anything to
protect their money-making in China.
</P>
<P>
In the open letter marking his formal retirement from the Chi Mei
leadership, Hsu expressed his anti-Taiwan independence stance,
claiming that both Taiwan and China are parts of "one China" and that
any move to seek Taiwan independence will lead the nation to war.
</P>
<P>
Hsu's letter represents a dramatic turnabout in his political
attitude, as he was previously regarded as an ally of President Chen
Shui-bian. Because of that, the People's Daily -- the mouthpiece of
the Chinese Communist Party -- named Hsu last June as an example that
Beijing does not welcome Taiwan businessmen who make cash in China
and funnel the money back to the independence movement in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Beijing has incessantly spooked "green businessmen, "
a term referring to DPP supporters in the business world, Chai said
that the enactment of the Anti-Secession Law has enabled Beijing to
exert unlimited pressure on Taishang.
</P>
<P>
Chai quoted intelligence from the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) as indicating that as long as the Taishang are labeled
by Beijing as "pro-independent" or "pro-Taiwan, " they can be sure of
having "irrational" taxes levied by the Chinese authorities or of
having their factories or companies investigated by tax officials
without warning.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese authorities can easily accuse Taishang of violating
the Anti-Secession Law, Chai added.
</P>
<P>
Chai said that if the government fails to craft efficient
solutions soon, the Taishang will face a life-or-death crisis, which
will in turn cause Taiwan's economy to "collapse, " he claimed, given
that Beijing's grip on the Taishang has tightened, making the 1
million-strong Taiwanese businessmen in China scapegoats for China's
so-called "united front."
</P>
<P>
Chi Mei Optoelectronics, one of the leading TFT-LCD flat panel
manufacturers in Taiwan, has several manufacturing operations in
China, although some new investment projects have hit snags as a
result of political implications.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officials from the MAC, the top government agency in
charge of Taiwan's China policy, said Sunday that they are gaining an
understanding of why Hsu wrote his open letter and the motives behind
his publication of the letter on the eve of the largest protest in
Taiwan history Saturday against the Anti-Secession Law.
</P>
<P>
According to Chi Mei spokesman Hsu Chun-hua, Hsu Wen-lung retired
from the Chi Mei chairmanship late last year. His open letter was
aimed at leaving a "blank paper" to his successor, Liao Chin-hsiang,
to allow him a free hand to run the conglomerate, which has
relentlessly sought expansion in China, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Hsu Chun-hua said that all the Chi Mei staff feel comfortable
with the former chairman's open letter, which claims that Chi Mei is
a neutral business group that will stay out of politics.
</P>
<P>
It is also hoped that the Chinese authorities will appreciate the
intent of the letter, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, Liao left for China Sunday, mainly to
inspect progress in the building of a new flat panel plant in Ningpo,
eastern China, and the expansion of a petrochemical plant in
Zhenjiang, also in eastern China.
</P>
<P>
Liao said late last year that he has always believed business
should be kept separate from politics. He added that he would rather
keep aloof from politics for "at least fifty years."
</P>
<P>
Claiming that he visits China one or twice every year and
maintains good connections with the authorities there, Liao said he
does not think his group has been discriminated against since the
People's Daily's lambasting of Hsu.

GUARANTEE BEFORE LIFTING ARMS BAN ON CHINA: GERMAN CONGRESSMAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Berlin,  March 26 (CNA)
(By Y.L. Lin)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The vice chairman of the ruling Social
Democrat Caucus in the German parliament, Gernot Erler, demanded
Saturday that Beijing must give a responsible guarantee in dealing
with the Taiwan issue before the European Union lifts its arms
embargo on China.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroder has insisted on the lifting of
the E.U.'s arms embargo on China since the E.U. leaders held a summit
meeting March 23.
</P>
<P>
The E.U. had planned to lift the embargo before the end of June,
but China's enactment of its Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan has
created a difficult political environment for the E.U. to remove the
ban.
</P>
<P>
The E.U. imposed the embargo in 1989 after the Tiananmen Square
massacre in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
According to Erler, the E.U. cannot give others the impression
that it has approved China's offensive policy toward Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Javier Solana, the E.U.'s foreign policy
representative, said in an interview that the E.U. has reservations
about the Anti-Secession Law.
</P>
<P>
"The threat of the use of non peaceful means to resolve the
Taiwan issue contradicts the European position, which is that the
one-China policy must be pursued only through dialogue," he said.

FAR EAST AIR PILOT DIES AFTER ATTACK IN CHINA
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A pilot from Taiwan's Far East Air
Transport Corp. was reportedly killed after he and another pilot from
the same company were assaulted Saturday at their guest house in
Zhuhai City, in China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Chien Sheng-chang was found dead, while his colleague Hsieh
Cheng-wei suffered serious head injuries. Both were stabbed in their
room in a guest house run by Southern China Air.
</P>
<P>
Chien, in his 30s and Hsieh, 48, were two of three Far East Air
pilots who were sent by the carrier to Zhuhai March 19 for a Boeing
757-200 flight simulator training program.
</P>
<P>
The Guangdong authorities have been silent over the incident,
while workers at the Zhuhai guest house have also kept tight-lipped
about the murder.
</P>
<P>
The official Xinhua news agency reported the incident briefly,
quoting "local police" as saying that "the crime occurred during a
dispute over counterfeit money, " but did not provide details.
</P>
<P>
Another unconfirmed source said that the two pilots were attacked
in their sleep by assailants who sneaked into their room to steal
their belongings.
</P>
<P>
The Far East Air authority in Taipei contacted the intermediary
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) for help after being informed of
the murder and wrote to the SEF's counterpart in Beijing, the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) , as well
as China's public security authorities, demanding that they find the
killer.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Far East Air officials are accompanying relatives of
Chien and Hsieh to Zhuhai.

KMT CHAIRMAN CALLS FOR CROSS-STRAIT DIALOGUE IN WAKE OF PROTEST MARCH
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 27 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan said Sunday that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should
resume dialogue and work together for mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
Lien made the remarks while meeting with members of a KMT
delegation on the eve of their departure for a visit to China. The
delegation will be headed by KMT Vice Chairman P.K. Chiang who is
also a KMT legislator-at large. Chiang's mission will be the KMT's
first official delegation to visit the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the KMT risks being labelled as pro-China
sympathizers -- or even traitors -- as the visit will come just two
days after huge crowds of Taiwan people marched in Taipei against
Beijing's anti-secession law.
</P>
<P>
However, Lien dismissed the allegation that the KMT is trying to
mend fences with an old enemy, saying that the KMT is mainly aimed at
reducing cross-strait tension.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that cross-strait relations are at a critical juncture,
Lien said the KMT, as Taiwan's largest opposition party, cannot sit
idly by and has to instead provide other choices and vision than
those offered by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).
</P>
<P>
Lien said the KMT, which ruled Taiwan for 55 years until May 20,
2000, opposes both the DPP administration's "one country on each
side" of the Taiwan Strait stance and Beijing's "one country, two
systems" unification scheme.
</P>
<P>
"The KMT is committed to defending the Republic of China's
national dignity and constitutional system. We don't think that
Taiwan should declare independence. Nor do we think that the Chinese
mainland should use force against Taiwan," Lien said, adding that "no
Taiwan independence and no mainland attack" is the KMT's ultimate
cross-strait policy.
</P>
<P>
In his view, Lien said, the two sides should shelve their
political disputes and work together for their common interests.
</P>
<P>
"There are many things that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
can do together for mutual benefit, and resumption of the
long-stalled cross-strait dialogue should be the top priority, " he
said.
</P>
<P>
Touching on Chiang's mission, Lien claimed that the delegation's
visit is of "great historical significance."
</P>
<P>
The KMT delegation will visit the cemetery of Dr. Sun Yat-sen --
the ROC's national founding father -- in Nanjing and the cemetery of
the martyrs who died in the Hwanghuagang Uprising in Guangzhou in the
southern mainland province of Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
"This year marks the 80th anniversary of ROC national founding
father Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death and the 94th anniversary of the
Hwanghuagang Uprising. Without the revolution led by Sun and the
Hwanghuagang Uprising, there would not have been the birth of the
ROC. Those events have sacred meanings to the KMT. Therefore, the
delegation's upcoming visit bears profound historical significance, "
Lien said.
</P>
<P>
The KMT, which once ruled all of China, has kept a low profile
because the visit comes at a sensitive time when many Taiwan citizens
are angry at China's so-called anti-secession law which codifies
Beijing's longstanding threat to attack Taiwan if it pursue separate
statehood.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will leave Taipei for the mainland Monday, just
two days after a massive protest march in downtown Taipei against
Beijing's ill-intentioned legislation.
</P>
<P>
Chiang claimed that the visit is aimed at averting escalation of
cross-strait tension in the wake of Beijing's anti-secession law.
</P>
<P>
In addition to visiting Guangzhou and Nanjing, the KMT delegation
will also travel to Beijing, but its itinerary in Beijing has not
been revealed. Political observers said the delegation may help pave
the way for Lien to visit the mainland before he steps down as KMT
chairman in August this year.

EIGHT YOUTHS CITED AS TAIWAN'S 'SELF-STRENGTHENING' HEROES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 27 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eight youths from poor or broken families
were cited Sunday as young "self-strengthening" heroes for their
courage demonstrated in the face of adversity.
</P>
<P>
The non-profit Taiwan Fund for Children and Families (TFCF)
presented "self-strengthening" awards to the eight youths, ranging in
age from 12 to 16, in recognition of their vitality and endurance in
the face of challenges and hardships that their counterparts from
normal families could never imagine.
</P>
<P>
The youths were selected from among 35,000 children and teenagers
nationwide who are on a TFCF list of recipients of some kind of aid.
</P>
<P>
According to TFCF Chairman Peng Ming-tsung, 12-year-old Chang
Teng-chieh from Nantou, central Taiwan, has received nine operations
over the past two years after a car accident, but has never shed a
tear in front of his mother.
</P>
<P>
Sustaining traumatic pain from the operations and walking with
artificial limbs, Chang often cheered up his counterparts many years
his senior who could not face being handicapped.
</P>
<P>
Tsao Huan-chen from the offshore county of Penghu has a broken,
financially constrained family, with a father who ran out when Tsao
was a baby, a mother who suffers depression after sustaining brain
injuries in a car accident and a senile grandmother.
</P>
<P>
Despite all his hardships, Tsao has studied hard and made himself
a scholarship recipient every year, as well as winning various awards
and prizes, including an educational award from President Chen
Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
TFCF -- a Taiwan version of the U.S. Christian Children's Fund
(CCF) -- has been lauded by Chen as "a driving force enabling the
government to try strenuously and undauntedly to administer the
country" for the unconditional care it provides for children from
underprivileged backgrounds.

OIL PRICE HIKES EXPECTED TO HAVE LIMITED IMPACT ON TAIWAN ECONOMY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 27 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice Premier Wu Rong-i said Sunday that
rising international oil prices are not expected to have a
significant impact on Taiwan's economic development because the
nation's dependence on imported oil has been dropping gradually.
</P>
<P>
Wu, who served as president of the Taiwan Institute of Economic
Research (TIER) before assuming his current post, made the remarks
while delivering a speech on the domestic and global economic
situations at an annual meeting of the Rotary International Taiwan
District 3460.
</P>
<P>
The momentum of the global economic growth is expected to slow
down due to continued hikes in international oil prices, a
lower-than-expected growth of the economy of industrialized nations
such as Germany, France and Japan, and a tightened monetary policy to
be adopted by the United States and China, Wu said, quoting the
latest report issued by Global Insight Corp.
</P>
<P>
Global Insight has forecast that the global economic growth will
drop from 2004's 4.1 percent to 3.3 percent in 2005 and that the
growth rate of the international trade volume for the whole of 2005
will slide from 2004's 8.9 percent to 4.2 percent, Wu pointed out
</P>
<P>
As for the domestic economic situation, Wu said that a yellow-red
light has been signalled for Taiwan's economy for five consecutive
months since December 2003, while a red light was recorded in May
2004.

</P>
<P>
The island's economy was rated yellow-red again during the
June-September period and green between October and December 2004 and
in January 2005, meaning that the domestic economy has been growing
steadily, Wu went on. In the government-devised five-color rating
system, a red light signifies an overheated economy, yellow-red
indicates a heating-up economy, green reflects steady growth,
yellow-blue stands for sluggishness and blue represents recession.
</P>
<P>
Despite the surging international oil prices, Wu said the value
of Taiwan's imported oil made up 25 percent of the country's total
import value in 1980 and that the ratio dropped to 8.3 percent in
2003, while the proportion of the total value of imported oil as a
ratio of the gross national product (GNP) fell from 12 percent in
1980 to 3.7 percent in 2003.
</P>
<P>
Wu further said that the production value of industries closely
related to imported oil accounted for 37 percent of the GNP in 1980
and that the figure dropped to 27 percent in 2003.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, continued hikes in international oil prices are
forecast to have a limited impact on Taiwan's overall economy, Wu
added.
</P>
<P>
However, the vice premier stressed that due to Taiwan's limited
national resources, the government will adopt concrete measures to
develop substantive energy and upgrade energy efficiency to face the
challenge from high oil prices.

TSU LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS TO PUSH FOR 'ANTI-INVASION' BILL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 27 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The legislative caucus of the opposition
Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) vowed Sunday to push for the early
passage of an "anti-invasion bill" after the March 26 mass rally
against China's Anti-Secession Law aimed at Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lo Chih-ming, chief convener of the TSU legislative caucus, noted
that the 326 March for Democracy and Peace ended peacefully Saturday
in Taipei, with the people of Taiwan showing their strong
determination to fight against Beijing's hegemony.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that the TSU will continue to push for the
legislation of an "anti-invasion peace law" in the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Calling on the ruling and opposition parties to support the draft
bill, Lo said the legislation will not only highlight the Taiwan
people's stance against Beijing's Anti-Secession Law but will also
provide a legal basis for a cross-Taiwan Strait peace mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Lo further said that the TSU caucus will maintain close contacts
with its counterparts of other parties to strictly supervise the
government's policies toward China.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, TSU Secretary-General Chen Chien-ming called on the
government to adopt concrete and feasible policies aimed at
safeguarding Taiwan's sovereignty and highlighting the nation's
international position.
</P>
<P>
Following the March 26 demonstration, the government should take
concrete action to defend the country's sovereignty in line with
mainstream public opinion, Chen said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the people of Taiwan have shown their firm
determination again and again to fight against Beijing's hegemony
from the "one-million-people-hand-in-hand" human chain rally held
Feb. 28, 2004 to the 326 March for Democracy and Peace, Chen demanded
to know what the government will do for the people in the wake of the
protest.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of Taiwanese marched down 10 major streets
Saturday in Taipei, symbolizing the 10 clauses of China's
Anti-Secession Law, and congregated for a carnival-like rally at the
square in front of the Presidential Office.

OVERSEAS TAIWANESE STUDENTS IN FRANCE OPPOSE ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Paris, March 26 (CNA)
(By Lo Yuan-shao and Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over 100 Taiwanese students pursuing
advanced studies in France gathered at the Paris Human Rights Square
Saturday to express their opposition to China's recently enacted
Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The students, who came from all over France after a week of
online organizing, delivered speeches in French to express their
discontent with the Anti-Secession Law, in which China gives itself
the so-called "legal right" to use non-peaceful means against Taiwan
if it decides the nation is moving toward independence.
</P>
<P>
Accusing the Beijing leadership of sabotaging peace across the
Taiwan Strait, they called on the European Union to refrain from
lifting an arms embargo against China, especially after the enactment
of the law.
</P>
<P>
Another group of Taiwanese students also took to the streets in
Lyon in central France in support of a mass rally held in Taiwan that
same day to defend democracy and peace, while Taiwanese studying in
Strasbourg also staged demonstrations against the law.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, France's main newspaper Le Monde covered Taiwan's 326
March for Democracy and Peace on its front page, claiming that
"nearly 1 million people" took part in the demonstration to show
their love for democracy and peace under the sponsorship of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party and 500 civic groups.
</P>
<P>
The report also quoted the results of a public opinion survey
conducted by the English-language Taipei Times as saying that 40
percent of those polled identified themselves as Taiwanese, not
Chinese.

KMT MISSION TO HEAD FOR CHINA MONDAY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 27 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An opposition Kuomintang (KMT) delegation
to be headed by KMT Vice Chairman P.K. Chiang is scheduled to embark
on a five-day visit to the mainland Monday, marking the party's first
official delegation to visit China, KMT sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Chiang, who is also a KMT legislator-at large, and the 27-member
delegation, are scheduled to first pay tribute at the cemetery of 72
martyrs who sacrificed their lives in the KMT-led Huanghuagang
Uprising against China's last empire, the Ching Dynasty, in
Guangzhou, southern Guangdong Province, Tuesday, or March 29. The
death of the 72 martyrs March 29, 1911 is designated as the Republic
of China's National Youth Day.
</P>
<P>
The group will then pay tribute at the mausoleum of ROC founding
father Sun Yat-sen in Nanjing Wednesday before heading north to
Beijing later in the day.
</P>
<P>
The KMT leadership declined to make known the group's itinerary
in Beijing, but said that meetings with key officials should be
expected.
</P>
<P>
It is widely speculated that Chiang's mission could mark a
stepping stone to a landmark visit by KMT Chairman Lien Chan in the
near future, given that both Ting Yuan-chao, director of Lien's
office and Chang Jung-kung, the KMT spokesman, are among the 27
delegation members.
</P>
<P>
Chang released the results of an opinion poll conducted recently
by the KMT that indicates that about half of the respondents support
the notion that the KMT should organize an influential delegation to
China to forge rapport, while some 30 percent of the respondents said
it is unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
The poll finds that most of the respondents do not want to see
cross-Taiwan Strait relations continue to deteriorate but would be
pleased to see the KMT help resolve the cross-strait stalemate and
help rekindle exchanges, Chang added.
</P>
<P>
Lien said earlier that "this year marks the 80th anniversary of
the death of ROC founding father Dr. Sun Yat-sen and the 94th
anniversary of the Hwanghuagang Uprising. Without the revolution led
by Sun and the uprising, there would not have been the birth of the
ROC. Those events have sacred meaning to the KMT. Therefore, the
delegation's visit bears profound historical significance, " Lien
said.
</P>
<P>
Lien also said Sunday that the KMT, as the dominant opposition
party in Taiwan, should strive to provide the people with other
options and a great vision.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party-led
government is leading Taiwan "nowhere, " Lien said that both sides
should seek to resume the long-stalled cross-strait dialogue for
mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
According to Chiang, the KMT delegation members will also meet
with China-based Taiwan businessmen for talks in Guangzhou, Nanjing
and Beijing to gain a better understanding of their situation
regarding operating in China.
</P>
<P>
Chiang's delegation will include nine KMT officials, 11 elected
KMT representatives and seven pro-KMT business and industrial
leaders.
</P>
<P>
The KMT, which once ruled all of China, has kept a low profile
because the visit comes at a sensitive time when many Taiwan citizens
are angry at China's Anti-Secession Law, which codifies Beijing's
longstanding threat to attack Taiwan if Beijing decides it is
pursuing separate statehood.

<TEXT>
<P>
Vice President Annette Lu said Sunday that
Taiwan businessmen operating in China, known locally as "taishang, "
should review their China-bound investment projects and refrain from
"blindly" expanding their investments there.
</P>
<P>
Lu made the appeal a day after a noted local business tycoon
published an open letter supporting Beijing's "one China" policy and
praising its newly enacted anti-secession law that codifies China's
longstanding threat to attack Taiwan if it decides the democratic
island pushes for separate statehood.
</P>
<P>
Hsu Wen-lung, founder of the Chimei Group, said in his letter
carried in a local newspaper Saturday that he felt "comfortable" with
the anti-secession law because independence will only push Taiwan
toward war and bring disaster to the people.
</P>
<P>
Hsu's statement came as a surprise and an embarrassment for the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration because he was one
of President Chen Shui-bian's big supporters during Chen's
presidential bid in 2000. Hsu's support for Chen made his China
business a target of retaliation by the Beijing authorities. The
publication of Hsu's letter coincided with a "million person" protest
march in downtown Taipei against Beijing's ill-intentioned law.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a television interview, Lu said she believes the
publication of Hsu's letter Saturday was part of a Beijing
countermeasure against Taiwan's unprecedentedly massive protest
march.
</P>
<P>
Lu further said she is convinced that the letter was not
conceived by Hsu himself, but was rather a Beijing-dictated
"deposition" signed by Hsu.
</P>
<P>
Recalling that she was forced to sign a Kuomintang
government-dictated "deposition" when she was imprisoned for the
pro-democracy Kaohsiung Incident during Taiwan's martial law era, Lu
said she was sympathetic to Hsu's plight and would not blame him.
</P>
<P>
Lu said she takes pity on what has happened to Hsu, saying that
Hsu issued the letter at the expense of his own reputation and for
the sake of a large number of people working for him in China because
he "did not have any other choice."
</P>
<P>
The outspoken vice president reminded taishang that among the
190-plus countries around the world, the People's Republic of China
is the only one that is hostile toward Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Since China's rubber-stamp National People's Congress passed its
so-called anti-secession law March 14, Lu said, relations across the
Taiwan Strait have reached a critical juncture.
</P>
<P>
"At this crucial moment, local businessmen should exercise
extreme prudence before venturing into the mainland market. Those who
have already invested in China should also review their future
operations and investment strategies to reduce risks," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
She further said her just-concluded diplomatic tour to El
Salvador and Guatemala was part of her efforts to help local
entrepreneurs adjust their investment strategies and foster new
business opportunities in Central America, Taiwan's major diplomatic
stronghold.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the delegation she headed has worked out several feasible
cooperative projects in El Salvador and Guatemala. Details of those
projects will be unveiled soon, she said.
</P>
<P>
"In the past, our businesses have focused on exploring the China
market and setting up footholds there. In the future, I hope our
entrepreneurs can look eastward for investment opportunities in
Central America, where we have many diplomatic allies and have good
business prospects," Lu added.

TAIWANESE EXPATS IN U.S. OPPOSE CHINA'S ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington, March 26 (CNA)
(By Wennie Chi and Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly 1,000 members from 17 Taiwanese
associations in North America congregated at Capitol Hill in
Washington, D.C. Saturday to protest China's recently enacted
Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was jointly organized by the World Federation
of Taiwanese Associations (WFTA) and the Taiwanese Association of
America in support of a mass rally held in Taiwan that same day to
defend the nation's democracy and peace.
</P>
<P>
WFTA Chief Coordinator Kuo Chung-kuo told the demonstrators that
the Taiwanese Associations in Washington, New York, Houston, Seattle
and Canada had mobilized their members to throw their support behind
the 326 March for Democracy and Peace held in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
During the rally, some of the demonstrators presented a satirical
play on China's enactment of its "bullying and irrational" law, which
gives China the so-called "legal right" to use non-peaceful means
against Taiwan if the country moves toward independence.
</P>
<P>
The protesters, divided into several groups, marched down the
street to the Chinese Embassy to protest the controversial law,
shouting "Democracy, Peace, Defend Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
The rally attracted many reporters, while John J. Tkacik, a U.S.
Heritage Foundation senior researcher familiar with cross-Taiwan
Strait affairs, also expressed his support for Taiwan's protest.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, over 800 Taiwanese expatriates and students gathered
in the square in front of United Nations Headquarters in New York to
voice their opposition to the law.
</P>
<P>
The protesters shouted "Shame on China, " "Peace for Taiwan, "
"China Hands off Taiwan Now, " and "Anti-Secession, China
Aggression."

<TEXT>
<P>
A delegation from the pro-independence
Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) is scheduled to arrive in Tokyo April 2
to attend a ceremony marking the inauguration of the party's chapter
in Japan, political sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 10-member delegation, to be headed by TSU Chairman Su
Chin-chiang, will be composed of TSU incumbent and former lawmakers
and TSU strategists, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Lin Chien-liang, vice president of the World Taiwanese Congress,
will serve as the top representative of the TSU's Japan chapter. Lin
said the TSU Japan chapter will also set up a branch in Osaka.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin, the TSU Japan chapter will focus on promoting
the party's exchanges and cooperation with major Japanese political
parties and boosting substantive Taiwan-Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
Lin said the TSU Japan chapter will also serve as a channel for
contacts between former President Lee Teng-hui, the TSU's spiritual
leader, and Japan's political and academic circles.
</P>
<P>
During its four-day visit, the TSU delegation will also attend an
annual meeting of the Japanese Friends of Lee Teng-hui Association
and meet with influential Japanese politicians, Lin added.
</P>
<P>
In Taiwan's political arena, the TSU is an ally of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party and the two parties are commonly known
as the "pan-green" camp which pursues a Taiwan identity separate from
that of China.

FORMER PRESIDENT CALLS FOR OVERHAUL OF CHINA POLICY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 27 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former President Lee Teng-hui urged the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration Sunday to overhaul
its policy toward China and stop its "active openness" attitude
toward China-bound investment.
</P>
<P>
Lee made the call at a seminar on new thinking for cross-strait
exchanges in the wake of China's enactment of its so-called
anti-secession law that codifies China's longstanding threat to
attack Taiwan if it decides the democratic island pushes for separate
statehood.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the anti-secession law has posed a new challenge to
Taiwan, Lee said that in the future, if China faces internal
instability, its rulers can use the law as a pretext to attack Taiwan
and thus sway Chinese people's attention from their domestic
problems.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Lee acknowledged that the law also offers new
opportunities for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the ill-intentioned law reveals Beijing's ambition to
become a regional power by force. Against this backdrop, Lee said,
the United States and Japan have recently declared that the Taiwan
Strait security is one of their common strategic objectives. In his
view, Lee said the joint U.S.-Japan statement implies a favorable
international climate for Taiwan to break the constraints of the
anti-secession law and pursue its ultimate goal of becoming a normal
country.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Lee went on, the DPP administration has adopted
an "active open" policy toward China-bound investment under pressure
from some people.
</P>
<P>
"They argue that such a policy could ease cross-strait tension.
However, China mainly treats cross-strait economic ties as a 'united
front' tactic with an ultimate goal of annex Taiwan, " Lee said,
adding that the "Hsu Wen-long" incident was the best example.
</P>
<P>
Lee was referring to an open letter published by Hsu Wen-long,
founder of Chimei Group, in a local newspaper Saturday which throws
support behind Beijing's "one China" policy and its anti-secession
law.
</P>
<P>
Hsu's statement came as a surprise and an embarrassment for the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration because he was one
of President Chen Shui-bian's big supporters during Chen's
presidential bid in 2000. Hsu's support for Chen made his China
business a target of retaliation by the Beijing authorities. The
publication of Hsu's letter coincided with a "million person" protest
march in downtown Taipei against Beijing's ill-intentioned law.
</P>
<P>
Lee said Hsu's dramatic about-face embodies the failure of the
DPP administration's "active opening, effective management" policy on
china-bound investment.
</P>
<P>
"While easing restrictions on cross-strait investment, the DPP
administration has failed to effectively manage China-bound
investments. The lax management has resulted in a gradual loss of
Taiwan's economic clout vis-a-vis China," Lee lamented.
</P>
<P>
With the anti-secession law escalating cross-strait tension, Lee
said, now is the time for Taiwan to make a complete overhaul of its
cross-strait economic policy and reinstate the previous "no haste, be
patient" cross-strait policy.
</P>
<P>
The "no haste, be patient" policy was implemented during Lee's
presidency. The policy was aimed at dissuading local businessmen from
blindly venturing into the mainland market or setting up production
facilities there.

'326 MARCH' EMBODIES MATURITY OF TAIWAN'S DEMOCRATIZATION: PREMIER

<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Sunday the smooth
and peaceful conclusion of the unprecedentedly massive march in
downtown Taipei a day earlier clearly manifests maturity of Taiwan's
democratization.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the remarks during an inspection tour of the Taipei
Fine Arts Museum where an exhibition especially organized
for visually impaired people is being held.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 1 million people from around the island took
to the streets in Taipei Saturday to voice their strong
opposition to China's newly enacted anti-secession law
that codifies China's longstanding threat to attack Taiwan if
it decides the democratic island works to make its present de
facto independence permanent.
</P>
<P>
"While the scale of the protest march was unprecedentedly huge,
the event proceeded smoothly in a carnival style to accentuate our
love for peace and democracy," Hsieh said, adding that the event
serves as yet another indicator that democracy has taken root in
Taiwan.

DPP URGES LEGISLATURE TO SCREEN CONTROL YUAN NOMINATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  27 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will ask the opposition-controlled
Legislative Yuan to include confirmation of the Control Yuan
nominations into its work agenda, a party whip said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
DPP whip Lai Ching-teh said the DPP caucus will come up with a
proposal Monday which will ask the legislature's procedures committee
to place the confirmation of the President Chen Shui-bian-initiated
Control Yuan nominations on to the legislature's work agenda at its
Tuesday meeting.
</P>
<P>
The opposition-controlled legislature has been reluctant to
screen the Control Yuan nominations on the excuse that President Chen
had not consulted with the opposition before finalizing the
nomination list.
</P>
<P>
Lai said the legislature can disapprove the nomination list, but
is not entitled to infringe upon the president's power of candidates
nomination authorized by the nation's Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The president referred the list to the legislature late last
year. As the tenure of the previous legislature expired in January
this year, the new legislature, which was inaugurated Feb. 1, has
asked the president to send a new list.
</P>
<P>
As a concession, Lai said, the DPP caucus would not oppose that
the legislature sends a letter to the Presidential Office asking the
president to re-send the list.
</P>
<P>
"The president can respond by informing the legislature that the
nominations will remain same as those named in the previously sent
list, " Lai said, adding that he hopes the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" of the Kuomintang and the People First Party can accept
this proposal to resolve this deadlocked issue.
</P>
<P>
The Control Yuan, the nation's supreme watchdog body that
supervises government operations, has stopped operations since the
tenure of previous Control Yuan members expired Jan. 31 this year.
</P>
<P>
President Chen has presented a list of nominations for new
Control Yuan president, vice president and 27 seats in the watchdog
body for the approval of the legislature in line with the
Constitution. However, the legislature has so far declined to screen
the list and has instead asked the president to come up with a new
list. Chen has rejected such a demand, saying that the request
violates the constitutional provisions.

TAIWAN EXPATS IN BRITAIN DEMONSTRATE AT CHINESE EMBASSY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
London,  March 26 (CNA)
(By N. K. Han and Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 200 Taiwanese expatriates in
Great Britain rallied in front of the Chinese Embassy in London
Saturday to protest China's recent enactment of its so-called
anti-secession law targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, including businessmen, students and individual
Taiwan expatriates residing in Britain, expressed their strong
opposition to China's anti-secession law that codifies the use of
non-peaceful means against Taiwan if it decides the democratic island
pursues separate statehood.
</P>
<P>
Responding to an online notice of the planned peaceful
demonstrations in major European countries, many Taiwan students
traveled from various British cities to London to lend their support
for the event.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, regardless of their party affiliations, waved
the Republic of China's national flags, banners and posters as well
as chanted English slogans to protest China's ill-intentioned
legislation.
</P>
<P>
They distributed leaflets to passers-by. The leaflets remind the
British government that China has raised its military spending by 12
percent this year and has pointed more than 700 ballistic missiles at
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
And now China enacts a so-called anti-secession law to codifies
its longstanding threat to attack Taiwan if it decides Taiwan moves
toward formal independence, the leaflets said, adding that the
British government should not support the proposal that the European
Union lift its arms ban against China.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that Taiwan is an independent sovereign state as well
as a liberal democracy, the leaflets said Taiwan's future should be
decided by its 23 million people, not anybody else.
</P>
<P>
The two-hour demonstration was jointly organized by major
Taiwanese associations in Britain.

MAC URGED TO WORK OUT MEASURES TO PROTECT 'TAISHANG'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 27 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) should worked out new measures to protect Taiwan businessmen
operating in China, locally known as "taishang, " in the wake of
China's enactment of the so-called anti-secession law, a lawmaker
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Lai Ching-teh, who concurrently serves as the legislative whip of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , said the "Hsu
Wen-long" incident indicates that China has stepped up pressuring
"taishang" to change their political stance after the enactment of
its anti-secession law.
</P>
<P>
Lai was referring to an open letter published by Hsu Wen-long,
founder of Chimei Group, in a local newspaper Saturday which throws
support behind Beijing's "one China" policy and its anti-secession
law.

Hsu's statement came as a surprise and an embarrassment for the

The Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) under
the Ministry of Economic Affairs will hold a seminar April 8 to
introduce the World Trade Organization (WTO) Dispute Settlement
Mechanism (DSM) to local industry, a BOFT official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the WTO, the dispute settlement mechanism is the
central pillar of the multilateral trading system and the world trade
body's unique contribution to the stability of the global economy.
</P>
<P>
"A dispute arises when one country adopts a trade policy measure
or takes some actions that one or more fellow-WTO members consider to
be breaking WTO agreements, or to be a failure to live up to
obligations," also according to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
The official said that more and more WTO members are using the
dispute settlement mechanism to protect their rights and interests and
to resolve trade quarrels.
</P>
<P>
BOFT Director-General Huang Chih-peng obtained a good result in
the preliminary stage of an anti-dumping consultation meeting he held
last month with his Indian counterpart in accordance with the WTO's
dispute settlement procedures, the official said.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that several BOFT officials will explain during
the seminar how to appropriately use the WTO dispute
settlement mechanism to expand overseas markets, as well as share
their experiences with the local industrial and trade sectors to
jointly work on the removal of trade barriers against Taiwan
products.

CROSS-STRAIT TASK FORCE SHOULD BE SET UP AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE: WANG

Taipei,  March 28 (CNA)

<TEXT>
<P>
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng on
Monday called for the accelerated establishment of the special task
force to be made up of legislators from across the political spectrum
to address cross-Taiwan Strait issues.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that legislators from the various parties have agreed
to create the task force with the principle of representation
according to the ratio of political parties' presence in the
legislature, adding that members of the group should be chosen
without further delay.
</P>
<P>
The task force will be made up of the legislative speaker, vice
speaker and 23 legislators, according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
The top priority of the task force will be organizing a
cross-party delegation of lawmakers to travel to mainland China to
bolster bilateral exchanges, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is imperative that the legislators visit the
mainland as one of the means to seek breakthroughs in the development
of cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
The legislative speaker said it is hoped that all future
cross-strait activities and relations will be included under the
operations of the legislative cross-strait affairs task force, which
he said he believes will allow Taiwan to get on better terms with the
mainland eventually.
</P>
<P>
However, Lai Chin-teh, caucus whip of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party, cautioned earlier this month that matters relating
to cross-strait ties are the responsibility of the president
according to the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Lai urged respect for the Constitution, adding that if the
cross-strait task force affects the purview of the president, then
this will undermine the Constitution.

Small family doctors' surgeries, a mainstay of the health service since

MOEA SUPPORTS FORMOSA PLASTIC GROUP'S STEEL MILL PLAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
supports Formosa Plastics Group's plan to build an integrated steel
mill in the Yunlin offshore industrial park in southwestern Taiwan, a
senior official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh was responding to a
media report that Formosa Plastics Group (FPG) , one of Taiwan's
largest private business groups, has decided to invest NT$135 billion
in building an integrated steel plant in the Yunlin offshore
industrial zone.
</P>
<P>
According to the media report, the new FPG plant -- the second of
its kind in Taiwan after Kaohsiung-based China Steel Corp.'s -- will
be able to produce 7.5 million tons of crude steel annually.
</P>
<P>
Asked about her views on the FPG's new investment plan, Ho said
the MOEA has consistently supported the FPG's steel mill project
because it is important to the development of Taiwan's steel
industry.
</P>
<P>
Ho said the MOEA welcomes business groups from home and abroad to
launch investment projects in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Under current domestic investment regulations, an environmental
impact assessment must be carried out prior to the construction of a
steel mill. Ho said the MOEA is now preparing for this work for the
FPG project.
</P>
<P>
If all goes smoothly, the media report said, the FPG steel mill
will begin operations by 2008.
</P>
<P>
FPG Chairman Wang Yung-ching reportedly has already informed
senior MOEA officials of his group's decision to launch its steel
mill project in the Yunlin offshore industrial zone and has asked for
the ministry's support for the project, particularly in land
acquisition and environmental impact evaluation.
</P>
<P>
Since the passage earlier this year of the Kyoto Protocol on
limiting greenhouse gas emissions, industries that produce high
levels of emissions, such as the steel and petrochemical industries,
are now subject to stricter environmental impact standards, the MOEA
officials noted, adding that the ministry will do its utmost to
assist FPG in overcoming all difficulties to realize its new
investment project as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
With the assistance of the MOEA, the media report said, FPG has
managed to secure a 600-hectare plot of land in the Yunlin offshore
industrial park for its new steel mill project. The group has already
built a petrochemical complex in the region.

TAIWAN TO CONTINUE TO FORGE AHEAD WITH WHA BID: FOREIGN MINISTER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 28 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Efforts to accelerate Taiwan's bid for
observer status in the World Health Assembly (WHA) , the decision
making body of the World Health Organization, will continue to forge
ahead, Foreign Affairs Minister Tan Sun Chen stressed Monday.
</P>
<P>
Although Taiwan's bid to take part in the WHA as an observer was
blocked again last year for the eighth consecutive year, Taiwan has
gained stronger support from friendly countries, including Japan and
the United States, Chen noted.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan will try again this year, Chen said, adding that all of
Taiwan's diplomatic missions abroad have been instructed to
consolidate ties with governments of their host countries to push
Taiwan's WHA bid ahead.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that Taiwan has a solid economy and mature
democracy, the island's diplomatic "space" in the international
community has continued to restricted due to China's suppression and
containment schemes, Chen lamented.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Chen vowed, Taiwan will not be daunted by Beijing,
which he said has played a "zero sum" game aimed at stealing away all
of Taiwan's diplomatic allies.
</P>
<P>
Although Taiwan, the 15th largest trading country in the world,
has been barred from joining most of the world's organizations and
activities that require statehood because of Beijing's interference,
the island has never been absent from international efforts,
including on the medical, health and humanitarian fronts, Chen added.
</P>
<P>
On news report that President Chen Shui-bian has instructed that
a "Global Fund -- the Friends of Taiwan Association" be established
and that his wife, first lady Wu Shu-chen, be made the chairwoman, to
promote Taiwan's medical and human rights diplomacy, the foreign
minister said he hasn't heard anything about the reported fund or
anything from the president on the matter.

326 PROTEST TURNED INTERNATIONAL TIDE FOR TAIWAN: NSB DIRECTOR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 28 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saturday's protest march against Beijing's
Anti-Secession Law has to some extent helped Taiwan turn the tide in
its favor internationally, National Security Bureau (NSB) Director
Hsueh Shih-ming said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hsueh made the remarks while fielding questions from opposition
People First Party Legislator Lin Yu-feng after giving a key report
on the protest march in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Calling the protest a collective display of the Taiwan people's
resentment of the law, Hsueh claimed that the activity in some ways
helped Taiwan gain an advantage over Beijing in the international
community after Beijing enacted the law March 14, justifying an
attack on Taiwan under certain conditions it sets.
</P>
<P>
According to the NSB head, Beijing will continue keeping a close
tab on Taiwan to see whether the island will resort to legal means,
including adopting an anti-annexation law, to counter its
Anti-Secession Law. Beijing is also expected to keep on seeking
international understanding as a means of lessening mounting pressure
arising from the law on itself, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hsueh said he believes that Saturday's protest has placed Taiwan
above the fray in an international propaganda campaign against
Beijing and that the international community is likely to further
press Beijing to reopen dialogue with Taiwan to settle bilateral
disputes.
</P>
<P>
The 326 March for Democracy and Peace was a successful exhibition
of the Taiwan people's resolve to protect Taiwan's identity and a way
to express their anger about Beijing, he said.
</P>
<P>
An estimated crowd of one million people took to the streets
Saturday in Taipei, including President Chen Shui-bian, Vice
President Annette Lu, Premier Frank Hsieh and former President Lee
Teng-hui, to show their disapproval of the Anti-Secession Law.
</P>
<P>
There were 5,833 armed policemen at the event to maintain order
and ensure the safety of the nation's leaders.

NOBEL LAUREATE POET WALCOTT TO TALK AT COLLOQUIUM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taoyuan,  northern Taiwan,  March 28 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
West Indian dramatist
and poet Derek Walcott, winner of the 1992 Nobel Prize in literature,
is scheduled to appear at a colloquium to be held at Yuan Ze
University in Taoyuan Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Walcott, who is also a painter and a professor at a number of
prestigious universities in the United States, is expected to have a
"transcultural dialogue" with Far East Group Chairman Tony Hsu and
several renowned writers in Taiwan, including Chen Juo-hsi, at the
colloquium.
</P>
<P>
Coming from a multicultural background -- born in Castries, St.
Lucia in 1930 to a British father and a West Indian mother, Walcott's
writings are rich in cultural nuance, employing such topics as racial
issues, identity and alienation of cultures, as well as the position
of languages.
</P>
<P>
Walcott, who skillfully fuses folk island culture with the
classical and avant-garde in his poems, could be an encouragement to
Taiwan's literary circles at a time when Taiwan is enthusiastically
promoting maritime culture, said a spokesman for the Kaohsiung City
Government, which invited Walcott to Taiwan to take part in the 2005
World Poetry Festival in Kaohsiung.
</P>
<P>
In addition to taking part in the world poetry festival last
Friday, Walcott attended a colloquium titled "Poetry, Language and
Identity, " sponsored by the National Museum of Taiwanese Literature
in Tainan City the same day, with various local poets, academics and
literati also taking part.
</P>
<P>
Walcott, who from the age of eight envisaged himself becoming a
poet, published his first poem at 14 and had his first verse
collection printed by the time he was 18.
</P>
<P>
Walcott, who divides his time between the United States and
Trinidad, exalts in the English language with his meticulously honed
poems and evocative dramas, while also using a rich mix of Latin,
French and Trinidadian patois.
</P>
<P>
In addition to poems and verse, Walcott also writes plays and
epic poems. His 1990 epic poem Omeros, which echoes Homer's Iliad and
Odyssey as it examines the Caribbean's colonial past and complex
present, won him the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Often focusing on West Indian folk traditions, Walcott's plays
include Dream on Monkey Mountain (1970), The Joker of Seville (1975),
A Branch of the Blue Nile (1986), while his verse collections include
In a Green Night (1962) , the autobiographical Another Life (1973) ,
Sea Grapes (1976) and Midsummer (1984).

KMT DELEGATION HEADS FOR CHINA FOR 'COMMEMORATIVE' VISIT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  28  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A delegation of the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) left for China Monday for a visit aimed at paying
tribute to the party's founder and martyrs as well as promoting
economic exchanges across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
It marked the first time that the KMT, which once ruled all of
China, has sent an official delegation to visit the mainland since
the party lost a bloody civil war to the Chinese Communists in 1949.
</P>
<P>
The 30-plus-member delegation, headed by KMT Vice Chairman P. K.
Chiang, who is also a legislator-at large, will visit Guangzhou,
Nanjing and Beijing during its five-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Chiang said prior to his departure that his mission will visit
the cemetery in Guangzhou of the 72 martyrs who died in the failed
Huanghuagang Uprising to overthrow China's last dynasty, the Qing, as
well as the tomb in Nanjing of Dr. Sun Yat-sen who founded the KMT
and the first republic in Asia -- the Republic of China (ROC).
</P>
<P>
"This year marks the 80th anniversary of ROC national founding
father Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death and the 94th anniversary of the
Huanghuagang Uprising. Without the revolution led by Sun and the
Huanghuagang Uprising, there would not have been the birth of the
ROC. Those events have sacred meanings to the KMT. Therefore, the
delegation's visit bears profound historical significance, " Chiang
said.
</P>
<P>
During its stay in Guangzhou in the southern Chinese province of
Guangdong and Nanjing in central China, Chiang said, the delegation
will also meet with Taiwan business people operating there, known
locally as "taishang, " to collect first-hand information about their
problems.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will also travel north to Beijing, Chiang said,
adding that the delegation's itinerary there has yet to be finalized.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said Chiang may meet with senior Chinese officials
during his stay in Beijing. But Chiang said no definite appointments
have been made yet.
</P>
<P>
Chiang further said the KMT, as Taiwan's largest opposition
party, is concerned about the 23 million local people's well-being
and is willing to do something to help ease strained relations across
the Taiwan Strait following Beijing's recent enactment of a law
justifying its longstanding threat to attack Taiwan if it thinks the
democratic island is seeking formal statehood.
</P>
<P>
According to Chiang, the KMT, which ruled Taiwan for 55 years
until May 20, 2000, is committed to defending the ROC's national
dignity and constitutional system.
</P>
<P>
"We don't think that Taiwan should declare independence. Nor do
we think that the Chinese mainland should use force against Taiwan.
We believe that 'no Taiwan independence and no mainland attack' is
the best strategy for the development of cross-strait relations and
for Taiwan to maintain its competitiveness and prosperity in the face
of China's rise as a regional economic power," Chiang said.
</P>
<P>
As there are many "taishang" in China, Chiang said the KMT
delegation will take advantage of the visit to discuss with relevant
mainland authorities measures to protect the rights and interests of
"taishang" and help them resolve problems.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether his mission will help arrange for KMT Chairman Lien
Chan to visit China in June as reported by local news media, Chiang
said commemoration of the KMT's revolutionary martyrs and exploration
of cross-strait economic issues are the only two purposes of the
visit.
</P>
<P>
If Lien truly intends to visit China, Chiang said he is not the
one who would be arranging Lien's itinerary.

DPP BEGINS REGISTRATION FOR PRIMARIES FOR YEAR-END ELECTIONS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
potential candidates began registering Monday for primaries for the
year-end city and county chief elections.
</P>
<P>
DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang said the party has the best
democratic mechanism and he is sure the best candidates will be
produced through the primaries.
</P>
<P>
Except for one city and five counties, registration for primaries
in 17 locations began Monday. Among those six, the DPP will adopt a
recruitment approach in Keelung City and Hsinchu County, while the
party's nomination in Hualien, Taitung, Kinmen and Lienchiang
counties will be put off until later.
</P>
<P>
Su said that there are quite a few outstanding aspirants in some
cities and counties, and that he'll have to wait for the end of the
registration on April 1 to see exactly how many people have
registered. If more than one person is vying for the same post, the
party will attempt to field a single candidate through negotiations
with those involved; however, if all the hopefuls insist on staying
the course, the party's candidate will be decided by the primary
system.
</P>
<P>
On whether he has communicated with the party's ally, the Taiwan
Solidarity Union, on the elections, Su said that the two parties
would coordinate if possible, but he added that the local situation
would have to be taken into account.
</P>
<P>
The DPP has set up a coordination team for the year-end
elections. The members of the team include Vice President Annette Lu,
Premier Frank Hsieh, Presidential Office Secretary-General Yu
Shyi-kun, DPP Central Standing Committee member Trong Chai, DPP
Secretary-General Lee Yi-yang, DPP Policy Committee Executive
Director Ker Chien-ming and National Security Council
Secretary-General Chiou I-jen.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an adviser to President Chen Shui-bian has decided to
resign to seek the DPP's nomination to run for Ilan County
magistrate.
</P>
<P>
Lin Te-fu registered at the DPP's Ilan headquarters Monday,
saying that the Presidential Office will understand his decision to
leave as advisor to concentrate on getting the party's nod to run in
the year-end election.
</P>
<P>
Lin said he has been unsure if he should throw his hat into the
ring over the last couple of weeks since he has been aware that
former Minister of Justice Chen Ding-nan announced his resignation
from his post earlier this year to return to his hometown in Ilan to
run for his old post. Chen Ding-nan served for two consecutive terms
as Ilan County magistrate between 1981 and 1989.
</P>
<P>
But more than 5,000 Ilan residents recently signed a petition to
support Lin, and many of them think that a transition of power to the
younger generation would be good for the party's future, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Lo Wen-jia, a former chairman of the Council
of Hakka Affairs registered to run for Taipei County magistrate
Monday. Former DPP Legislator Lin Feng-hsi registered for the
Taichung County magistrate race.
</P>
<P>
Former Legislator Tsao Chi-hung registered his intention to vie
for Pingtung County magistrate.
</P>
<P>
As Presidential Office adviser Chiu Mao-nan has also announced
his bid for the Pingtung County Magistrate nomination, Tsao said he
hoped that the party would find a solution to the conflict of both
wanting to run for the same position; however, if this is not
possible, then he said he will respect the outcome of the primary
vote.

PRESIDENT CHEN OPEN TO SECOND MEETING WITH PFP CHAIRMAN: AIDE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  28 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian is open to
holding a second meeting with opposition People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong, Secretary-General to the President Yu Shyi-kun
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
President Chen is willing to meet Soong for a second time if the
PFP chairman agrees to the idea and the president will fully respect
Soong's opinion in this regard as to how, when and where the meeting
should be arranged, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
The top presidential aide's remarks came after a large protest
against Beijing's Anti-Secession Law ended peacefully Saturday in
Taipei.
</P>
<P>
A large number of Taiwan people, mainly supporters of the
independence-leaning ruling Democratic Progressive Party and its
ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, took to the streets in downtown
Taipei to voice their objections to the law that arbitrates
"non-peaceful means" to handle Taiwan should the island edge toward
independence.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian also participated together with his
family in the rally.
</P>
<P>
Soong met President Chen Feb. 24 in a gesture of reconciliation
between the governing party and the opposition camp in view of
cross-Taiwan Strait tensions, annoying backers of the opposition "pan
blue alliance" of the Kuomintang, the PFP and the New Party.
</P>
<P>
Soong and Chen made public a 10-point joint statement following
the meeting, in principle focusing on Chen's stance not to change the
official designation of the Republic of China and not to declare
Taiwan independence during his term.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, Soong was opposed to Chen's participation
in Saturday's protest.
</P>
<P>
In light of the message released by the Presidential Office about
a second Chen-Soong meeting, Soong pointed out that it would be
better for them to meet again after both have clearly thought
things over and come up with better ideas than the 10-point joint
statement already issued.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that he is in no hurry to meet Chen again, Soong urged
both the ruling and opposition parties to face up to the reality and
engage in rational exchanges to meet public expectations now that
Saturday's protest is over.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the sensitive cross-strait relations, Soong
expressed his belief that the 10-point joint statement offers the
best solutions to cross-strait disputes and that they must be carried
out to serve that end.
</P>
<P>
Confrontation is not the way to settle cross-strait problems and
the people in Taiwan want parity, dignity and peace in its dealings
with mainland China, he said, adding that this is something of which
Beijing must be cognizant.

DPP LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS AGAINST FORMATION OF CROSS-STRAIT PANEL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The time is not right for the Legislative
Yuan to form a special task force to handle cross-Taiwan Strait
affairs or to organize a delegation of lawmakers to visit China, a
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) spokesman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We would be falling into China's trap if the legislature were to
send a delegation to Beijing shortly after the enactment of its
so-called anti-secession law targeting Taiwan, " said Lai Ching-teh,
the DPP's legislative whip.
</P>
<P>
Lai made the remarks after Legislative Yuan President Wang
Jin-pyng, while commenting on a media report that China would welcome
a visit to Beijing by a Taiwan legislative delegation, said earlier
in the day that the legislature will form a cross-party cross-strait
affairs panel as soon as possible to discuss the feasibility of
sending a delegation to China.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China has faced international pressure following its
March 14 enactment of a law justifying its longstanding threat to
attack Taiwan if it thinks the democratic island is seeking formal
statehood, Lai said any Taiwan political party that sends a
delegation to Beijing at present would be tantamount to extending a
helping hand to China.
</P>
<P>
"A visit to China by a party delegation or a cross-party
legislative delegation at the moment could also mislead the
international community into concluding that opposition to China's
law is not Taiwan's mainstream public opinion. Such misinterpretation
would hurt our national interests," Lai argued.
</P>
<P>
As to the formation of a legislative cross-party task force to
handle cross-strait affairs, Lai said the time is also not opportune
for the legislature to discuss such a topic.
</P>
<P>
"We should wait until after the cross-strait situation changes, "
Lai said.
</P>
<P>
The media report about Beijing's welcome of a Taiwan legislative
delegation to visit China coincided with the departure of a
delegation of opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers and party
officials for a five-day visit to China that will take the delegation
to three Chinese cities -- Guangzhou, Nanjing and Beijing.
It marked the first time that the KMT, which one ruled all
of China, has formally sent a delegation to visit China since it lost
a loody civil war to the Chinese Communists in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
According to the media report, Beijing authorities have also
invited Taiwan's another opposition party --the People First Party --
to send a delegation to visit China.

</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  28  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sixty-two percent of those surveyed
recently said that the government should go slow with
the opening of direct cross-strait passenger and cargo flights and
assess the situation cautiously, a poll released Monday showed.
</P>
<P>
The poll, published by Wealth Magazine, also found that only 20
percent said that the sooner the government opens direct cross-strait
transportation the better, while 10 percent said the government
should never open it.
</P>
<P>
The monthly commissioned Focus Survey Research to conduct the
survey by calling on adults over 20 years old between March 7 and 9.
A total of 1,086 effective samples were collected with a margin of
error of 2.97 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether China's enactment of the Anti-Secession Law will
increase the possibility of a cross-strait war, 50.1 percent said it
will not, while 39.1 percent said it probably or definitely a
possibility.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether President Chen Shui-bian will open direct
cross-strait transportation links during his term, which will run
until 2008, around 42 percent said he will, while nearly 37 percent
said he won't.
</P>
<P>
On which political figures are most suitable to serve as
cross-strait negotiators, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou received the
highest rating at 17 percent, followed by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party Legislator and former Mainland Affairs Council
Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen at 16.7 percent, former Premier and Chung-Hua
Institution for Economic Research Chairman Vincent Siew at 14.6

island move toward formal independence, 58.9 percent of those polled
said that direct cross-strait transportation will be positive,
compared with 22.8 percent who responded negatively.
</P>
<P>
Those who think direct cross-strait transportation will add
employment opportunities accounted for 30.3 percent, compared with 54
percent who said it will cut the employment rate. Also, 20.8 percent
said they would consider working in mainland China after direct
cross-strait transportation links were established, compared with
77.3 percent who said they don't consider such a possibility.

PHASING OUT NUKE POWER IN 10 YEARS `IMPOSSIBLE': ECONOMIS MINISTER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 28 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the government's firm resolve to
make Taiwan a nuclear-free country, it will be impossible for it to
phase out nuclear power in the next 10 years, Minister of Economic
Affairs Ho Mei-yueh said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ho made the remarks at the Legislative Yuan after opposition New
Party Legislator Lai Shyh-bao raised questions about the government's
nuclear power policy during an interpellation session.
</P>
<P>
Ho said that no more new nuclear power plants will be licensed to
be built in Taiwan and that the existing four nuclear power plants
will be gradually phased out in line with a quota-based management
system. But she added that phasing out nuclear power altogether will
be impossible in a 10-year period.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out the operating costs of nuclear power plants is
cheaper -- at NT$0.64 per 1000W/Hr -- than the NT$1.5 per 1000W/Hr
cost of thermo power, Lai contended that the government's goal of
making Taiwan nuclear-free will be hard to achieve in the short term
as nuclear energy still accounts for 20 percent of the country's
total power generation.
</P>
<P>
Lai said that the public is deeply concerned about much-discussed
hikes in water and electricity rates, and he asked Taiwan Power
Company officials to elaborate upon the company's policy in the face
of rising running costs due to soaring prices of oil, coal and
liquefied natural gas in the world market.
</P>
<P>
According to Taipower Chairman Lin Ching-chi, the company will
follow government instructions in raising its rates.
</P>
<P>
Buffeted by increased spending on fuel, the state-run company
suffered a deficit of more than NT$9 billion (US$285 million) in
2004.

1ST NEW IMMIGRANT LEARNING CENTER INAUGURATED IN TAOYUAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new immigrant education center, the
first of its kind in Taiwan, was inaugurated Monday in the northern
county of Taoyuan, to help foreign spouses of local citizens adapt to
Taiwan's lifestyle quickly and smoothly.
</P>
<P>
The new facility, located in the Chungchen Elementary School in
Taoyuan's Pingjen City, will offer language and other training
courses for the 37,000-plus foreign spouses residing in the county.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the inaugural ceremony, Vice Minister of Education Fan
Sun-lu said the Ministry of Education selected Chungchen Elementary
School as the site for the center mainly because Taoyuan County has
the island's third-largest population of foreign spouses after Taipei
County and Taipei City.
</P>
<P>
If the future, Fan said, the ministry will set up similar
education centers in central and southern parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Taoyuan County Magistrate Chu
Li-lun said one out of every seven babies in Taoyuan is born into a
family with a foreign spouse.
</P>
<P>
To meet the demand of those families, Chu said, the county
government will spend NT$32 million annually on specially designed
education programs for foreign spouses and their children in order to
upgrade the quality of the local population and help new immigrants
adapt to life in Taiwan.

CANADIAN PARLIAMENT URGED TO PASS RESOLUTION ON CHINA'S NEW LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government will continue to monitor
whether the interests and security of Taiwan businessmen operating in
China have been affected by Beijing's enactment of its Anti-Secession
Law and will urge Canada's Parliament to adopt a resolution opposing
the law, a senior official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu made the remarks
while meeting with a Canadian parliamentary delegation.
</P>
<P>
Wu told his Canadian guests that a noted Taiwan business tycoon
has already fallen victim to China's Anti-Secession Law that codifies
China's longstanding threat to attack Taiwan if it thinks the
democratic country is seeking formal statehood.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Hsu Wen-lung, founder of Taiwan's Chi Mei Group,
published an open letter in a local newspaper apparently throwing his
support behind Beijing's "one China" policy and the Anti-Secession
Law. Hsu's letter came as a surprise and an embarrassment to the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party administration because he was one
of President Chen Shui-bian's big supporters during Chen's
presidential bid in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Hsu's support for Chen made his China business a target of
retaliation by the Beijing authorities and the publication of Hsu's
letter coincided with a "million person" protest march in downtown
Taipei against Beijing's ill-intentioned law.
</P>
<P>
Wu said he believes that Hsu is the first victim of the new law.
</P>
<P>
The nation's top China policy planner expressed his gratitude for
the Canadian government's explicit opposition to China's attempt to
use non-peaceful means to solve disputes across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Wu further said he hopes the Canadian Parliament can adopt a
resolution opposing China's Anti-Secession Law in order to pressure
the Beijing leaders to pay attention to the international community's
common expectation that cross-strait issues be resolved peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that Taiwan is a liberal democracy, Wu said that the
people of Taiwan enjoy freedom of choice and freedom of speech.
</P>
<P>
"The Anti-Secession Law stipulates that unification is the only
option for the development of cross-strait relations. Such a
provision ignores the Taiwan people's freedom of choice, " Wu said,
adding that by dictating "unification" as the Taiwan people's "legal
and sacred obligation, " Beijing has unilaterally altered the
cross-strait status quo.
</P>
<P>
Worse still, Wu said, the new law justifying the use of
non-peaceful means against Taiwan starkly violates the United Nations
charter that requires peaceful solution to all international
disputes.

BEIJING BEGINS TO CARRY OUT 'NON-PEACEFUL MEANS' AGAINST TAIWAN: MAC
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China has already begun to carry out its
"non-peaceful means" against Taiwan under the newly passed
Anti-Secession Law by forcing a noted Taiwan business tycoon to
express support for the law, Mainland Affairs Council Vice Chairman
Chiu Tai-san claimed Monday,
</P>
<P>
Chiu was referring to Hsu Wen-lung, founder of the Chi Mei Group,
who published an open letter Saturday supporting Beijing's "one
China" policy and praising the Anti-Secession Law.
</P>
<P>
Hsu said in the letter that he was "comfortable" with the newly
enacted law because independence will only push Taiwan toward war and
bring disaster to the people, but the Taiwan authorities described
the letter more as a "deposition" crafted by Beijing and signed by
Hsu.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said that the law has seriously hurt cross-Taiwan Strait
relations and the feelings of the Taiwan people, pointing out that
hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets Saturday to
express their opposition to the law.

</P>
<P>
He urged China to address the Taiwan people's will, to stop
immediately its damaging and provocative actions and to take
effective measures to improve cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
On top of the Anti-Secession Law, Chiu went on, China has
continued to push for several measures that have exacerbated
cross-strait relations, including forcing Taiwan businessmen and
Taiwan students in China to take sides politically in an attempt to
stifle Taiwan's democratic development.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Beijing has forced some heads of Taiwan
businessmen's associations in China, as well as Taiwanese students,
to express support for the legislation.
</P>
<P>
Beijing also asked Hsu, who has major investments in China, to
express his support for the Anti-Secession Law on the eve of the
March 26 March for Democracy and Peace in an attempt to embarrass
President Chen Shui-bian, because Hsu was a big supporter of Chen in
his presidential bid in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said that Beijing's crude approach does not change the fact
that the Anti-Secession Law is a war authorization law and will not
change the fact that Beijing is sabotaging cross-strait relations,
Chiu said.
</P>
<P>
He urged Beijing to address the will of the Taiwan people and
adopt measures to redress its "wrong policy."

SHIELD BUSINESSMEN FROM TAIPEI-BEIJING POLITICAL FIGHT: PFP CHIEF
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  28  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is a pity for Taiwan that its
authorities cannot shield its people from being forced by Beijing to
declare their support for "one China," opposition People First Party
Chairman James Soong said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Soong made the statement after reports that Hsu Wen-lung, founder
of the Chi Mei Corp. and a former senior adviser to President Chen
Shui-bian was speaking with tongue in cheek when he declared Friday
that he favors Beijing's premise of "one China."
</P>
<P>
In order to protect Chi Mei's huge investment in China, the
reports said, Hsu had no choice but to parrot the Beijing line.
</P>
<P>
As a long-time supporter of the pro-independence Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) , Hsu sent shockwaves across the Taipei
political landscape with his statement on the eve of a huge
anti-China protest sponsored in part by the DPP.
</P>
<P>
Instead of blaming Hsu for betraying his homeland, DPP
politicians expressed sympathy with the business tycoon and vented
their anger on Beijing for using Taiwan businessmen to sell its "one
China" policy.
</P>
<P>
Soong said the Taiwan authorities should feel shame for local
businessmen's dilema that was crystallized by Hsu's reluctant
pro-China statement.
</P>
<P>
In order to hold their own against foreign competitors, Soong
said, Taiwan businessmen have had to ventured into the China market,
but the government's mishandling of its ties with China has increased
the tension between the two sides, leaving these businessmen on the
horns of a dilemma.
</P>
<P>
Soong said Beijing should stop playing Taiwan businessmen against
the Taiwan authorities and that the DPP should stop stirring up the
tensions across the Taiwan Strait for its own political ends.
</P>
<P>
Both Beijing and Taipei should realize that their closely
interwoven economic ties make it impossible for them to confront each
other in politics. The sooner they wake up to this reality and
formulate their policy accordingly, the better it will be for people
on both sides of the strait, Soong said.

Taiwan will continue medical diplomacy by
selecting five hospitals to have exchanges with their counterparts in
Palau, Kiribati, Tuvalu and Marshall Islands, the Department of
Health (DOH) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chang Wu-hsiu, head of the DOH's bureau of international
cooperation, said Taiwan will provide medical equipment and
technology to these countries.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Taiwan has signed health cooperation agreements
with these countries and plans to present the results in
international conferences.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the exchange project has no time limit and if
the hospitals are willing, they can continue to have exchanges with
those countries, with the government providing a maximum subsidy of
NT$1.5 million (US$47,468) a year.
</P>
<P>
On media reports that President Chen Shui-bian has instructed the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Cabinet-level DOH to establish a

of any such development.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Global Fund is a U.S.-led fund-soliciting group

AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, and countries or organizations can
submit their projects on combating these diseases and ask the fund

Yokohama City Mayor Niroshi Nakada called
on Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou Monday and expressed hope that the two
cities can have more exchanges and work toward Asian development.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese mayor also said that China, Japan and Taiwan have to
develop peaceful dialogue on China's emergence.
</P>
<P>
Ma noted that cross-Taiwan Strait relations entered a new stage
with China's recent enactment of its Anti-Secession Law, but said
that a crisis can also be a turning point and claimed that while tabs
should be kept on China's development, there is no need to panic.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he said that China has miscalculated Taiwan's
situation, and does not know that most Taiwan people want to maintain
the status quo. If one understands this point, the situation in the
Taiwan Strait will not deteriorate to military crisis, according to
Ma.
</P>
<P>
Ma, who concurrently serves as a vice chairman of the opposition
Kuomintang, noted that another KMT vice chairman, P.K. Chiang, is
currently leading a 34-member delegation on a visit to China and is
expected to meet high-ranking officials there with the aim of
lowering cross-strait tension.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that more high-ranking KMT officials will visit
China in the latter half of the year, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
Nakada conveyed the hope of promoting substantial exchanges
between the two cities, including educational and cultural exchanges.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes to begin some programs when he comes to Taipei
again to attend the Taipei International Healthy City Expo 2005 this

LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER MARKS YOUTH DAY, OUTLINES VISION FOR TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 29 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng
marked Youth Day Tuesday by climbing Tatun Mountain in suburban
Taipei with a group of students, where he outlined his vision for
Taiwan, in particular the country's relations with mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Wang appealed for peace between Taiwan and China in light of
recent cross-Taiwan Strait tensions, and he unveiled his intention to
invite Wu Bangguo, chairman of the Standing Committee under the
National People's Congress -- China's parliament -- to visit Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"Now that our people have gone to the mainland for a visit, it is
time for theirs to come to Taiwan, " Wang said, referring to a
Kuomintang (KMT) delegation led by party Vice Chairman P. K. Chiang
that headed to the mainland a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
Chiang's trip to China, on the eve of the March 29 Youth Day, is
widely believed to clear the way for a planned mainland visit by KMT
Chairman Lien Chan in June. Lien is slated to step down from the
party's top post in August.
</P>
<P>
The time is right for the legislature to invite Wu to Taiwan to
help promote sound exchanges and usher in peace across the Taiwan
Strait, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that a legislative task force is also expected to be
set up soon to help the government address the fragile cross-strait
situation, he said that the Legislative Yuan would also consider
sending a mission to visit China.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he himself would be willing to visit China, the
legislative speaker made it clear that he would only do so under the
principles of parity and reciprocity and when the time is ripe and
with the approval of the Taiwan people.
</P>
<P>
He called on the government to step up exchanges among students
across the strait and suggested academic accreditation between the
two sides given that more and more Taiwan students are heading to
China to study.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that Youth Day is a time to remember the young people
that sacrificed their lives to help found the Republic of China in
the party's uprising against the Ching Dynasty, China's last empire,
Wang also urged visionary young people to join the KMT at a time when
it needs new blood for reform and to push the nation ahead.
</P>
<P>
Wang's visit to Tatun Mountain with students was seen by some as
a move to prop up backing for his bid to vie for the KMT
chairmanship, as his staunch rival, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-joeu, has
also kicked off his campaign.
</P>
<P>
Both Wang and Ma are vice chairmen of the main opposition party.
The KMT has five vice chairmen.

NEW CROSS-STRAIT EXCHANGES TO TAKE ANTI-SECESSION LAW INTO ACCOUNT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 29 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government's new measures concerning
cross-strait exchanges will take into consideration China's recent
enactment of the Anti-Secession Law, the vice chairman of the
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Liu Teh-hsun made the remarks in a breakfast meeting with the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) caucus in the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The KMT legislative caucus invited officials from the MAC and the
Council of Agriculture (COA) to report on the future course of
cross-strait relations after hundreds of thousands of Taiwan people
staged a march Saturday to protest against Beijing's newly passed
law.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator Su Chi said that the law, which justifies an
attack on Taiwan under certain conditions it sets, is part of
Beijing's carrot-and-stick approach toward Taiwan. He said that while
enacting the law, Beijing has also tried to lure Taiwan with various
incentives, including offering to allow the island's agricultural
products to be exported to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Su asked what the government will do in addition to staging the
March 26 protest.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the private sector hopes to resume cross-strait talks
and that the MAC said last month that cross-strait talks can be based
on the bilateral talks in Hong Kong in 1992, Su also asked about
Beijing's response.
</P>
<P>
In reply, Liu said, the government will not restrict cross-strait
exchanges that are conducive to lowering cross-strait tensions.
</P>
<P>
Those exchanges will basically continue in a regular manner, but
the government will take Beijing's Anti-Secession Law into account
when considering new measures regarding cross-strait exchanges, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the government wants to forge national
consensus on a resumption of cross-strait dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Another KMT legislator, Kuo Su-chun, said that the Canton Fair in
Guangzhou will be staged in mid-April, with five pavilions featuring
Taiwan agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
In addition to exempting Taiwan agricultural products from a 17
percent value-added tax, Guangzhou will also facilitate customs
clearance, Kuo noted, saying that the government should support the
participation of Taiwan agricultural products in the fair.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chieh, KMT caucus whip, claimed that the COA has not only
not been supportive of this, it has even boycotted such a move.
</P>
<P>
COA Vice Chairman Lee Chien-chuan explained that China imposes
tariffs of up to 16 percent on agricultural products, and that on top
of this, it imposes a 17 percent value-added tax, making it difficult
to export such products to China. In addition, China only allows 12
kinds of agricultural products in after quarantine, and its custom
clearance is too slow, he continued.
</P>
<P>
The private sector on both sides of the Taiwan Strait can consult
and communicate on the long custom clearance period, but the issues
of tariffs and quarantine will have to be left for the governments of
the two sides to discuss, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the government will not take the initiative to
support Taiwan's agricultural products to be exported to the mainland
and that it has not blocked Taiwan agricultural products from taking
part in the Canton Fair. The government just doesn't have the
budget to support the marketing activity, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the custom clearance facilitation will only be
temporary, and that a continuation of such incentives after the fair
is more important, which he said will require talks between the two
governments.

PREMIER RULES OUT REPRISE OF 'NO HASTE' CROSS-STRAIT POLICY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  29 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Tuesday the
government will continue to promote peaceful dialogue across the
Taiwan Strait and will uphold its "active opening, effective
managing" cross-strait investment policy instead of reinstating the
previous "no haste, be patient" strategy.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the remarks at a Legislative Yuan interpellation
session where opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lai Shyi-bao
asked the premier whether the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
administration will revise its cross-strait policy after China's
recent enactment of its so-called anti-secession law and the massive
protest march in Taipei last weekend against Beijing's
"ill-intentioned" legislation.
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging that Beijing's new law has further strained
cross-strait reltions, Hsieh said the DPP administration, after a
comprehensive evaluation, has decided to adopt a peaceful and
rational manner in dealing with the new challenge.
</P>
<P>
"Peace and rationality are the best strategy to forge domestic
unity and counter China's threat. International news media have given
prominent coverage to our 326 March for Democracy and Peace in
protest against the anti-secession law. Major countries around the
world have also denounced the law that codifies China's longstanding
threat to attack Taiwan, " Hsieh said, adding that all these
developments have proved the efficacy of the government's response
strategy.
</P>
<P>
As to the future development of cross-strati relations, Hsieh
said the government will adopt a wait-and-see attitude for the time
being.
</P>
<P>
"In the wake of the anti-secession law, we must watch Beijing's
follow-up moves before we hammer out our new cross-strait policy.
Once we are sure that our national security is not at stake, we will
continue to promote peaceful cross-strait dialogue, " Hsieh said,
adding that in some cases, "silence is golden."
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the government is likely to reinstate the "no
haste, be patient" cross-strait investment policy implemented by the
previous KMT administration headed by former President Lee Teng-hui,
Hsieh said the DPP administration would not reimpose such a policy
because it couldn't resolve practical problems faced by Taiwan
businesspeople.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said Hsu Wen-lung, founder of the Chi Mei Group, one of
Taiwan's largest private petrochemical and optoelectronics groups,
was the first local entrepreneur to fall victim to the anti-secession
law.
</P>
<P>
According to Hsieh, Hsu launched huge investments in China during
the KMT administration when the "no haste, be patient" policy was in
place.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said that although the "no haste" policy set stringent
restrictions on China-bound investments, enforcement had been lax,
resulting in many flaws and problems.
</P>
<P>
"The DPP administration has replaced such an ineffective policy
with an 'active opening, effective managing' one. We would rather
adopt a more relaxed policy toward China-bound investment while
strengthening enforcement. Therefore, we have no plan to drop the
'active opening' policy or to reinstate the 'no haste' policy, "
Hsieh stressed.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Hsu Wen-lung, who retired from the Chi Mei Group
chairmanship a year ago, published an open letter in a local
newspaper apparently throwing his support behind Beijing's "one
China" policy and the anti-secession law.
</P>
<P>
Hsu's letter came as a surprise and an embarrassment to the DPP
administration because he was one of President Chen Shui-bian's big
supporters during Chen's presidential bid in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Hsu's support for Chen has made his China business a target of
retaliation by the Beijing authorities, and the publication of Hsu's
letter coincided with a "one million people" protest march in
downtown Taipei against Beijing's law. Many local people believe that
Hsu was forced to issue the open letter in exchange for Beijing's
favor.

LEGISLATURE MUST ACT ON EXPO 2008 FOR EVENT TO GO FORWARD: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 29 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Legislative Yuan must act in a timely
fashion to push through legislation for the Taiwan Exposition 2008;
otherwise, there is the risk that the event would have to be
canceled, Premier Frank Hsieh said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the comment at the Legislative Yuan, where a group of
lawmakers, magistrates and county council speakers from Taoyuan,
Tainan and Chiayi, the three counties designated to jointly host the
event, had gathered to try and get the ball rolling for needed
legislation so that they can start making concrete plans for the
expo.
</P>
<P>
If the legislation is stalled and cannot be cleared by April, the
premier said, it would be better to just call off the whole thing to
avoid international embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
The premier explained the necessity for a special statute at a
legislative question-and-answer session a few days ago, saying the
bill is designed to give local governments a freer hand in preparing
and raising funds for the expo.
</P>
<P>
Although the expo is three years away, time is actually short as
much needs to be done, including passing the statute and creating a
special budget, he said.
</P>
<P>
Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng said he supports the
project and promised to help coordinate lawmakers and expo officials
when asked to do so.
</P>
<P>
According to the central government's plan for Taiwan Expo 2008,
the exhibition will run from May to September at the three counties
along the High Speed Railway at an estimated cost of NT$19.5 billion
spread over the next four years. The main exposition sites will be in
Taoyuan and Tainan, with a supplementary site in Chiayi.
</P>
<P>
The event is expected to attract about 5.5 million visitors --
five million foreigners and 500,000 locals. It is projected to
generate NT$5 billion in revenues, according to the organizer, the
Ministry of Economic Affairs.

No people from Taiwan were killed or
injured in the earthquake that rocked Indonesia's Nias Island around
midnight, officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Republic of China representative office in
Jakarta, no tourists from Taiwan or ROC nationals living in Indonesia
lost their lives or were hurt in the disaster -- just a few months

The Jakarta representative office has relayed the ROC

Initial reports said that the death toll could reach 2,000 but
more recent assessments carried on wire reports put the dead at
around 300 in the aftermath of the strong quake measuring a
preliminary 8.7 on the Richter scale that jolted Nias Island in
Indonesia at about 15 minutes past midnight. Cities in eastern
Sumatra, including Medan, lost electricity after the quake.

OPPOSITION PARTY'S VISIT TO M'LAND A STEP BACKWARD: PRESIDENT CHEN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 29 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A high-level Kuomintang (KMT) delegation
currently in China to meet with Chinese Communists to discuss
"reconciliation" is an " incredible" situation that turns back the
clock 60 to 80 years, President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
President Chen made the remarks when he was asked about P. K.
Chiang, a vice chairman of the KMT, who is leading a delegation on a
visit to China ostensibly to help lower cross-strait tensions. The
president was at the inauguration of a youth learning institute.
</P>
<P>
Chen pointed out that the biggest differences between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait are not about separate rule; rather, they
are about different living styles and systems, saying that it is a
matter of democracy versus communism, and peace versus threats.
</P>
<P>
If Taiwan continues to fracture along party lines and the ruling
and opposition parties continue to bicker, Taiwan will disintegrate
without any outside force having to intercede, which he said is the
biggest potential crisis facing Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"Only with a unified Taiwan will cross-strait relations be
stable," the president stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said that recently "someone" has traveled to the other side of
the Taiwan Strait to push for "reconciliation between the KMT and
the Chinese Communist Party," a situation that seems out of place in
time and harkens back to the days of 60 to 80 years ago when the two
parties were trying to find some common ground.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan currently promotes democratic and constitutional rule, the
president said, so it is "incredible" to see the KMT and the Chinese
Communists talking. Chen said he wondered what sort of agreement
would they were trying to sign.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Communist Party of China still keeps a firm grip
on the government and the military, but Taiwan is already a
democracy, and no one should put the party above the nation.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Tuesday is Youth Day, the president said that all
young people should think about the fact that the nation is now
entering the 21st century, and that a country can only progress by
moving ahead, not by backpedalling 60, 70 or 80 years.
</P>
<P>
"Believe in the people and 'Taiwan first' will be the correct
option," he said.
</P>
<P>
President Chen also took the chance to explain the significance
of a massive march in which hundreds of thousands of Taiwan people
took to the streets to protest China's recent enactment of the
Anti-Secession Law.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that in the past, large rallies were aimed at
underscoring democratic reforms, or were held to make a statement
about certain figures or policies, which he said were internal
affairs of the nation, but this time "we stood together" against the
outside threat of Beijing's law, which codifies the use of force
against Taiwan should the island move toward formal independence.
</P>
<P>
The march was also significant because the motivational forces
behind the event were the people and not political figures. This
time, political figures, including himself, Premier Frank Hsieh and
many government officials gave no speeches, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The president also said that the 326 March for Democracy and
Peace was a "bona fide international press conference," not "his own,
one-man press conference, " adding that a million people marched to
show the world their opposition to Beijing's law, and the
international media saw, heard and reported this.
</P>
<P>
Chen was responding to earlier remarks by James Soong, who said
before March 26 that if he were president, he would consider many
options, including holding an international news conference, and that
he would not have taken to the streets himself.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that at the march, "silence spoke volumes," and that "
political figures have genuine strength and the most influence when
they are not saying anything."
</P>
<P>
The president said the 326 march was also significant in that the
theme, " democracy, peace and safeguarding Taiwan, " is the common
language of the people of Taiwan, and one on which the ruling and
opposition parties share the most common ground.
</P>
<P>
The march had no radical rhetoric and the participants used a
"rational, peaceful and humble" manner to display their will, he
added.

MND DENIES PERSONNEL STRUGGLE BEHIND KINMEN COMMANDER'S REPLACEMENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 29 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ministry of National Defense officials
denied Tuesday a report suggesting that a personnel struggle was
behind the recent replacement of the chief military officer on the
frontline island of Kinmen.
</P>
<P>
Vice Minister of National Defense Huo Shou-yeh told legislators
that Kinmen Defense Command Commander Cha Tai-chuan, who suffers from
Meniere's syndrome, was transferred from the position so that he
could receive health exams in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Meniere's syndrome is a condition of excess pressure accumulation
in the inner ear.
</P>
<P>
Huo said the ministry will arrange another suitable position for
Cha if he is physically able to resume his duties.
</P>
<P>
The ministry announced a day earlier that Cha's position was to
be assumed by Army Deputy Commander-in-Chief Chia Fu-yi for the time
being because Cha had been recalled to Taiwan for medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
However, a local daily reported Tuesday that a personnel struggle
could have been the true reason behind Cha's replacement.
</P>
<P>
According to military spokesman Liu Chih-chien, Cha returned to
Taiwan last week and is currently undergoing comprehensive
examinations at Tri-Service General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
Liu said the ministry's decision to transfer Cha from his
original position was made out of good intentions, as the position
requires whomever is in charge to remain on standby at all times to
deal with any contingencies.

KMT DELEGATION VISITS HUANGHUAGANG MAUSOLEUM OF 72 MARTYRS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Guangzhou,  March 29 (CNA)
(By Mandy Wong and Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 34-member delegation from Taiwan's
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) made a historic visit to the Huanghuagang
Mausoleum of 72 Martyrs in suburban Guangzhou in the southern Chinese
province of Guangdong Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, headed by KMT Vice Chairman P.K. Chiang, who is
also a legislator-at-large, paid tribute to the 72 revolutionary
martyrs who died trying to overthrow the last Qing dynasty in the
Huanghuagang Uprising prior to the establishment of the first
republic in Asia -- the Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
A large crowd of Chinese citizens lined up to welcome the arrival
of the KMT delegation at the cemetery. Nearly 300 Chinese, Taiwanese
and foreign journalists covered the event.
</P>
<P>
Led by Chiang, all delegation members bowed three times before
the monument commemorating the Huanghuagang martyrs. They also
observed a moment of silence.
</P>
<P>
Later on, the delegation met with Taiwanese businessmen operating
in the Guangdong area. In the afternoon, the delegation flew to
Nanjing.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the delegation is scheduled to visit the cemetery
of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, who founded the KMT and led the revolution to
establish the ROC. The delegation will meet with Nanjing officials
and Taiwan businessmen operating in Jiansu province before departing
for Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The delegation's Beijing itinerary has not been revealed.
According to reports, the delegation is expected to meet with Jia
Qinglin, chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, before concluding its Beijing visit and returning to
Taipei via Hong Kong Friday.
</P>
<P>
The delegation arrived in Guangzhou Monday afternoon. Chiang and
all delegation members then met with Guangdong Provincial Governor
Huang Huahua and presidents of major Taiwanese trade associations in
the province to discuss matters of mutual interest. In the evening,
Huang hosted a dinner in honor of all delegation members.
</P>
<P>
Chiang's mission is the first official KMT delegation ever to
visit China since the party, which once ruled all of China, lost a
bloody civil war to the Chinese Communists and fled to Taiwan in
1949.
</P>
<P>
Chiang said after his arrival in Guangzhou that commemoration of
the KMT's revolutionary martyrs and exploration of cross-strait
economic issues are the only two purposes of the visit.
</P>
<P>
The visit came at a sensitive time when many Taiwan citizens are
angry at China's enactment of a law justifying an attack on Taiwan
under certain conditions it sets. In Taipei, pro-independence Taiwan
Solidarity Union lawmakers labeled the visit as a "trip of kowtowing
to communist foes."

'PAN-BLUES' AGAIN BLOCK U.S. ARMS BILL FROM LEGISLATIVE AGENDA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  29 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once again, the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) , the People First Party (PFP) and
the New Party Tuesday block a bill onto the legislative agenda for
the purchase of a controversial package of weaponry from the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The KMT and the PFP caucuses of the legislatures said that a
special budget for the major arms procurement would increase the
national debt, and so should not be referred to the National Defense
Committee for review.
</P>
<P>
This was the second time the bill has been blocked from being put
on the legislature's agenda since the Cabinet marked down the ceiling
price for the procurement package from the original NT$610.8 billion
to NT$480 billion (US$15.38 billion) because a plan to build
submarines in Taiwan was dropped, and because the new Taiwan dollar
has appreciated against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet first proposed a similar bill for the purchase of six
Patriot PAC-III anti-missile batteries, eight diesel-electric
submarines and a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft from the
United States last year, but it, together with a proposed special
budget for the procurement, was shelved by the legislature owing to
opposition from the majority "pan-blue alliance."
</P>
<P>
After the proposed statutes and budget were killed at the end of
the last legislative term in January this year, the Cabinet had to
re-submit them to the new legislature that started Feb. 1.

ACTIVISTS TO LAUNCH EXPEDITION IN MAY  TO DEFEND TIAOYUTAIS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  May 29 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Hong Kong-based Action Committee for
Defending the Diaoyuislands (ACDD) is scheduled to launch an
expedition to the Tiaoyutai Islands in the East China Sea next month
to assert Chinese sovereignty over the island group, ACDD Chairman
David Ko said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During an telephone interview with CNA, Ko said that his
committee has been planning this for a long time and that raising
money is the major task at the current stage.
</P>
<P>
"Our target is one million Hong Kong dollars, which will be used
to purchase boats to carry activists from all corners of the earth, "
Ko told CNA. Ko said that as far as he knows, many activists from
China, Taiwan, the United States and Canada have decided to take part
in the sovereignty defending trip slated for mid-May.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ACDD is also launching an online signature
campaign among ethnic Chinese to urge the United Nations to reject
Japan's bid for a permanent seat in the U.N. Security Council, Ko
said, adding that over 2,000 signatures have been received so far.
</P>
<P>
Japan first claimed the Tiaoyutai Islands in 1895, but China and
Taiwan insisted that the islands have been Chinese territory for
centuries. The uninhabited island group, known as the Senkaku Islands
to the Japanese and called the Diaoyutais by China, is located some
102 nautical miles northeast of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
China ceded the Tiaoyutai Island group to Japan in 1895 at a time
when the last Chinese imperial dynasty -- the Qing dynasty -- was in
sharp decline and losing territory to aggressive foreign powers.
</P>
<P>
After World War II, the islands were put under U.S. control, at
which time the ROC government demanded their return. In 1972,
however, the United States returned the islands to the Japanese
government -- a decision that governments and patriotic groups on
both sides of the Taiwan Strait continue to protest.

THOSE ON DPP PAYROLL GET THREE PERCENT PAY RAISE

(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials working for the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will get a pay raise of 3 percent,
effective April 1, DPP Secretary-General Lee Yi-yang said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first raise for DPP officials since 2000.
</P>
<P>
Lee noted that government employees got a pay raise in 2001, but
DPP workers have not had one since 2000.
</P>
<P>
DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang discussed the matter with Ker
Chien-ming, head of the party's financial committee, and it was
decided that the party would appropriate an additional budget to pay
for the raises.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Wen-tsang, director of the DPP's Department of Culture and
Information, explained the situation amid reports that the largest
opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT) , is continuing to try to
streamline the party because of financial problems.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said that his party couldn't be compared to the KMT in
terms of the number of party members or the size of their offices,
noting that the DPP has only around 180 officials. The KMT has about 
1,600 on its payroll.
</P>
<P>
The DPP Central Standing Committee passed the additional budget
proposal of NT$20 million (US$62,893) Tuesday. In addition to
funneling around NT$4.7 million into the pay raises, the rest will be
used in celebration of the 10th anniversary of the party's women's
department and the formation of another committee.
</P>
<P>
DPP workers were elated to hear about the pay raise, Cheng said,
adding that they often work for the party without taking off
holidays, and everyone was happy to have some reward.

KMT, PFP SUPPORT INVITING CHINESE PARLIAMENT CHAIR TO VISIT TAIWAN

<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and People
First Party (PFP) lawmakers expressed their support Tuesday for
Legislative Yuan speaker Wang Jin-pyng's proposal to invite his
Chinese counterpart, Wu Bangguo, to visit Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Wang said earlier in the day that with the approval of
legislators from across party lines, the legislature will send a
delegation to visit China and invite Wu, chairman of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress of China, to visit Taiwan
in an effort to enhance cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges.
</P>
<P>
KMT legislative caucus whip Chen Chieh said Wang's proposal will
help temper cross-strait tensions following the enactment of the
Anti-Secession Law by China earlier this month and the massive
demonstration against the law in Taiwan last week.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the legislature has an obligation to promote peace
across the Strait to protect the interests of China-based Taiwanese
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
PFP legislative caucus convener Chen Chih-pin said his party
supports any efforts that are helpful to cross-strait peace.
</P>
<P>
Legislators from the pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) , however, strongly opposed the idea of inviting Wu to visit
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
According to TSU legislative caucus convener Lo Chih-ming, Wu's
visit would stain the Legislative Yuan because the National People's
Congress of China was the "executioner" who passed the Anti-Secession
Law that threatens the use of force against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
If Beijing retracts the law to show its goodwill to Taiwan, the
TSU will support Wu's visit under the principles of equality and
dignity, Lo said.

Tsai made the remarks at the MND recruitment center, where the

PREMIER REAFFIRMS GOVERNMENT'S ROLE IN CROSS-STRAIT ENGAGEMENTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  29 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Tuesday he
supports civilian exchanges across the Taiwan Strait, but he stressed
that any cross-strait engagements involving the exercise of public
authority must be handled by the government.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh was responding to inquiries about his view on an opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) delegation's current visit to China, which has been
labeled by the pro-independence opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union
as a "trip of kowtowing to the KMT's old communist foes."
</P>
<P>
The premier said he is not opposed to political parties or
private groups organizing delegations to visit China to boost mutual
understanding and forge rapprochement.
</P>
<P>
However, he insisted that any cross-strait dialogue,
consultations or agreements involving the exercise of public
authority cannot take effect without the participation of the
government.
</P>
<P>
As to whether the delegation, headed by KMT Vice Chairman P.K.
Chiang, is likely to conspire with the Chinese communists to boycott
Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration, Hsieh
said he believes Chiang will keep in mind Taiwan's overall
national interest while engaging with the Beijing authorities.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what Chiang's purpose is during his China visit.
But as far as I know, he is a decent man. I believe he will take into
account national interests and the Taiwan people's feelings during
his China trip," Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
Traveling at the head of a 34-member KMT delegation, Chiang, also
a legislator-at-large who once served as minister of economic affairs
and Legislative Yuan deputy speaker, departed Taipei Monday for a
five-day visit to China to pay tribute to KMT martyrs and meet with
Taiwan businessmen operating in China, known locally as "taishang."
</P>
<P>
As the visit comes at a sensitive time when many Taiwan citizens
are angry at China's enactment of a law justifying an attack on
Taiwan under certain conditions, local pro-independence activists
have bashed the trip as "surrendering to the old enemy."
</P>
<P>
Fielding questions during a legislative interpellation session,
Hsieh said the KMT, which once ruled all of China, has a historic
feud with the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
"It might not be bad for Chiang to head a delegation to visit the
mainland to seek reconciliation between the two parties, " Hsieh said
sarcastically.
</P>
<P>
After losing a bloody civil war to the Chinese communists in
1949, the KMT fled to Taiwan and ruled the island for 55 years until
May 2000. It lost the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections but still
manages to control a slim majority in the legislature thanks to its
"pan-blue alliance" ally of the People First Party.

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that
health, medical care and disease control know no boundaries and
claimed that "people's diplomacy" is something that cannot be blocked
by political power.
</P>
<P>
Chen urged the international community to pay attention to what
he described as "this trend of world development."
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks during a meeting with Lee W. Graber,
president of the World Federation of Orthodontists.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that Taiwan was excluded when an organization for
orthodontists in the Asia-Pacific region was established in 2000 in
Tokyo, but pointed out that the people of Taiwan are still involved
in various international activities.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, academic exchanges should be benevolent,
disinterested and foresighted. There should not be barriers between
different races and nationalities in the medical field, he added.
</P>
<P>
Chen said ideological and political considerations should not be
allowed to limit academic exchanges or it will go against the spirit
of the global village and hinder the progress of the international
community.

DPP QUESTIONS RATIONALE OF KMT'S 'CHINA RUSH'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 29 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) legislative whip questioned Tuesday the rationale of senior
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) leaders' keen interest in making what he
called "kowtowing" trips to China.
</P>
<P>
"It's outrageous that top KMT leaders are enthusiastic about
visiting China at a time when many Taiwan citizens are angry at
China's enactment of a law justifying an attack on Taiwan under
certain conditions," said Chen Ching-chun, the DPP legislative caucus
secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks after Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang
Jin-pyng, a KMT vice chairman, said earlier in the day that the
opposition-controlled legislature will soon form a special task force
to handle cross-Taiwan Strait affairs that will organize a
cross-party delegation to visit China.
</P>
<P>
With the consent of the ruling and opposition parties, Wang said,
he himself would also be willing to visit China "with dignity."
Moreover, Wang went on, the legislature plans to invite Wu Bangguo,
chairman of the Standing Committee of China's rubber-stamp parliament
-- the National People's Congress -- to visit Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Responding to Wang's statements, Chen noted that a KMT delegation
headed by another of the party's vice chairmen, P.K. Chiang, is
currently on a visit in China.
</P>
<P>
"To the best of my understanding, KMT Chairman Lien Chan is
planning to visit China this summer. And now Wang voices his interest
in traveling across the Taiwan Strait. It's unthinkable that KMT
leaders are crazy about visiting China at this sensitive moment, "
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the cross-strait issue is one of the government's
most important public policies, Chen said forging a domestic
consensus is crucial in dealing with the challenges posed by China's
Anti-Secession Law.
</P>
<P>
"Now is not the right time to visit China. I'm afraid that the
KMT's 'China rush' might be misinterpreted by the international
community as 'Taiwan supporting the Anti-Secession Law.' Should that
be the case, our national interest would be at stake," Chen pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
He further questioned why, if the KMT can reconcile with
communist China, it cannot respond to the DPP's repeated calls for
domestic inter-party reconciliation. " I simply cannot understand why
the KMT chairman would not meet with President Chen Shui-bian while
thinking about meeting with Beijing's leaders," he added.
</P>
<P>
As to Wang's proposal to invite the Chinese parliamentary head to
Taiwan, Chen said the DPP has consistently looked forward to peaceful
cross-strait exchanges. Nevertheless, he said, a domestic consensus
on the issue must be forged before sending out any invitation to
senior Chinese officials.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, DPP Secretary-General Lee Yi-yang said the KMT
delegation's visit to China comes at the wrong time.
</P>
<P>
While the DPP welcomes cross-strait civilian exchanges, Lee said,
the KMT delegation's visit at this crucial moment could have an
adverse impact on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
For one thing, he said, the KMT's move hurts Taiwan's image as a
country with solid internal unity and might even mislead the
international community into thinking that Taiwan has given into
China's Anti-Secession Law.
</P>
<P>
Worse still, Lee said, it could give China the wrong impression
that Taiwan no longer insists on its sovereign status or protests
China's military threat in the wake of the enactment of the
Anti-Secession Law.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the DPP's scathing bash, a KMT spokesman
said the KMT, as Taiwan's largest opposition party, is
obligated to help promote peaceful cross-strait exchanges. The KMT
delegations's current visit is part of the party's efforts to help
forge cross-strait rapprochement for benefits of people on both sides
of the strait, he added.

DEMOCRACY `BECOMES STRATEGIC THINKING OF U.S.': FOREIGN MINISTRY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 29 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recent remarks by U.S. Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice indicate that democracy has "become the strategic
thinking of the United States in dealing with the rise of China, "
according to a report submitted Tuesday to the Legislative Yuan by
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Under these circumstances, Taiwan should continue to promote the
values of democracy and freedom to the international community and
highlight its efforts and goodwill in maintaining cross-Taiwan Strait
peace in order to secure a favorable position in the
Taipei-Washington-Beijing triangular relations, the report suggests.
</P>
<P>
The report, which analyzes relations between Taiwan, the United
States and China after Rice's recent visit to Beijing, is set for
presentation during the legislature's Foreign and Overseas Chinese
Affairs Committee on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It notes that during her Asian trip earlier this month, Rice
repeatedly stressed the values of democracy and freedom and said the
democratic development of Taiwan is a positive message for China's
future political development.
</P>
<P>
Rice also urged China to respect human rights and practice
freedom and democracy as soon as possible, and added that Washington
will enhance its alliances with Japan, South Korea and India, it
points out.
</P>
<P>
The report says that as shown from Rice's remarks, the "one
China" policy, the three communiques between Washington and Beijing
and the Taiwan Relations Act remain the basics of the United States'
cross-strait policy, while the North Korea issue and China's
Anti-Secession Law are the two main reasons for uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
The United States is expected to maintain close consultations
with China to facilitate the reopening of six-party talks on the
nuclear problem in North Korea, and Taiwan will keep close watch of
the situation, the report says.
</P>
<P>
Washington is also deeply concerned about the enactment of the
Anti-Secession Law by China and its continued military buildup, it
adds.

CROSS-STRAIT TRADE RISES 47.3 PERCENT IN JANUARY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 29 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The volume of trade between Taiwan and
China in January grew 47.3 percent from the same period of a year
earlier to US$5.81 billion, the Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) under
the Ministry of Economic Affairs reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The figure accounted for 18.9 percent of the total value of the
island's foreign trade during the same month, up 1.3 percent from the
year-earlier level, according to BOFT-released statistics.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's exports to China in January rose 42.3 percent
year-on-year to US$4.12 billion, the highest single-month level in
history, accounting for 27 percent of the island's total exports, the
statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, imports from China increased 61.1 percent to US$1.68
billion, making up 10.9 percent of the total imports by Taiwan, in
comparison with 8.9 percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Taiwan recorded a trade surplus of US$2.44 billion,
up 31.6 percent from the year-earlier level, according to the
tallies.
</P>
<P>
BOFT Deputy Director-General Wu Hsin-hua said Taiwan's imports
from and exports to China in January posted a growth of higher than
40 percent, mainly due to a lower comparison basis because last
year's Lunar New Year holiday was in January.
</P>
<P>
Wu attributed the highest single-month export level mainly
to a handsome increase in exports of organic chemicals, steel and
related products, and plastics and related products, as well as oil
products triggered by continuing hikes in international oil prices
and great demand from China.
</P>
<P>
Wu said it is worth noting that China's top three import sources
in January were Japan, South Korea and Taiwan in that order, with
South Korea replacing Taiwan as China's second-largest supplier.
</P>
<P>
China's imports from South Korea hit US$5.19 billion, higher than
the US$5.07 billion-worth of imports from Taiwan, according to the
statistics.

MAC PROMISES NO BACKTRACKING ON CROSS-STRAIT ECONOMIC POLICY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 29 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Joseph
Wu said Tuesday that the government's cross-Taiwan Strait economic
policy will not backtrack on the "no haste, be patient" policy,
despite the enactment of the Anti-Secession Law by China.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the European Chamber of Commerce in Taipei, Wu
pledged that the government will carry out the conclusions of the
economic development conference of 2001.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Anti-Secession Law attempts to
unilaterally change the cross-strait status quo in which Taiwan and
China are independent of each other and hurts the interests of the
Taiwan people, who were prompted to voice their protest through a
massive peaceful demonstration last week.
</P>
<P>
Owing to the frequent economic exchanges between Taiwan and
China, a number of issues, such as imports of Chinese commodities,
dual taxation and intellectual property rights protection, are
pending negotiations, Wu noted.
</P>
<P>
Also, the launch of cross-strait charter cargo flights and direct
transportation links are two other major issues that require
negotiations between the two sides, he said.

PRESIDENT WILL MEET LEGISLATURE'S REQUESTS WITHIN LAW: AIDE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 29 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian will yield to
whatever requests the legislature make as far as they are within the
law, the president's chief of staff, Yu Shyi-kun, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In reply to journalists' questions about the president's response
to the legislature's request for him to re-nominate appointees for
members of the Control Yuan, Yu said Chen's staff are studying the
law governing the issue.
</P>
<P>
However, he was reserved about the legality of the legislature's
request, saying that while one of the ways to determine the
constitutionality of the request is to appeal for an interpretation
of the Constitution by the Council of Grand Justices, the method is
too slow to solve the problem facing the country.
</P>
<P>
Another way to break through the impasse between the legislature
and the president would be negotiations, Yu said without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
The issue was caused by the preceding legislature, which turned
down Chen's requests to approve his nominees for members of the
Control Yuan and asked the president to replace en masse the nominees
who, they claimed, fail to live up to public expectations for members
of the Control Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The president refused, putting him at loggerheads with the
legislature over the issue until the term of the legislature expired
in February.
</P>
<P>
Instead of dying down with the end of the preceding legislature,
the issue was rekindled with the swearing-in of the new legislature,
which also refused to act on the president's nomination on the
grounds that it was submitted to the last legislature.
</P>
<P>
In order to have the current legislature affirm the nominees,
they claimed in a letter to the president Monday, Chen has to present
his nominations to the legislature again.
</P>
<P>
Yu said he did not see why the president should re-nominate the
appointees with the election of the new legislature, as the new
legislature is supposed to finish the jobs left by its predecessor.
</P>
<P>
The issue should be solved through negotiations between the
President's Office and the Legislative Yuan in consultation with the
related laws, Yu said.

INVITING CHINA NPC CHAIRMAN TO VISIT TAIWAN NOT VIABLE: DPP LAWMAKER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  29 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A legislator of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) called on Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang
Jin-pyng Tuesday to make careful deliberations before extending an
invitation to Taiwan to the chairman of China's rubber-stamp National
People's Congress (NPC) amid escalating tension between the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
William C.T. Lai, a whip of the DPP legislative caucus, made the
appeal after Wang said earlier in the day that with the approval of
legislators from across the political spectrum, he will lead a
delegation to visit China and invite NPC Chairman Wu Bangguo to visit
Taiwan in an effort to enhance cross-Taiwan Strait interaction.
</P>
<P>
It is inappropriate for the legislature to send a delegation to
China and invite Wu to Taiwan because China has recently enacted the
Anti-Secession Law targeting the island, Lai explained.
</P>
<P>
"If we extend an invitation to Wu at present, " Lai said, "it
would relay an erroneous message to the international community that
Taiwan's legislature does not care about Beijing's enactment of the
controversial law."
</P>
<P>
The Anti-Secession Law passed March 14 provides Beijing with the
so-called "legal right" to use non-peaceful means against Taiwan if
Beijing decides the island is moving toward formal independence.
Officials from the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council have
slammed it as tantamount to a "blank check" authorizing China to use
force against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party
(PFP) lawmakers expressed their support for the proposal made by
Wang, who is also a KMT vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
KMT legislative caucus whip Chen Chieh said Wang's proposal will
help temper cross-strait tensions following the enactment of the
Anti-Secession Law by China earlier this month and the massive
demonstration against the law in Taiwan last week.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the legislature has an obligation to promote peace
across the Strait to protect the interests of China-based Taiwanese
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
PFP legislative caucus convener Chen Chih-pin said his party
supports any efforts that are helpful to cross-strait peace.

CHIP IMPLANTS HELP COMA VICTIMS REGAIN CONSCIOUSNESS

<TEXT>
<P>
Six out of 12 patients in comas regained
consciousness after being implanted with a chip in their central
nervous systems, Liu Jung-dung, a neurologist at the
Chung Shan Medical University Hospital in Taichung City, central
Taiwan said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Liu said at a news conference that the chips, implanted by
him into the patients' spinal cords between skull and neck, were
connected to pulse producers implanted in the patients' chests,
conveying pulses to stimulate and revive their brain cells.
</P>
<P>
Although all of the patients had been in deep comas for four
months to seven years before the treatment, six of them regained
consciousness several months after the implantation, and three of
them who met the press at Tuesday's new conference had regained some
speaking ability.
</P>
<P>
Liu said the experiment, started in February 2004, has found that
the procedure is more effective for patients who went into a coma
because of brain damage and have been in a coma for only a few years.

BEIJING URGED TO ACQUIESCE IN TAIWAN'S WHA BID
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  March 29 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing should acquiesce in Taiwan's
bid for World Health Assembly (WHA) observer status as a means to
mend the new rift in cross-Taiwan Strait relations caused by China's
recent enactment of its Anti-Secession Law, a think-tank China hand
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Alan Romberg, senior associate and director of the East Asian
Program of the Henry Stimson Center, said Tuesday that the new law,
which authorizes the use of "non-peaceful means" against Taiwan
should the island move toward formal independence, has hurt the
feelings of the Taiwan people.
</P>
<P>
If Beijing wants to mend its fences with Taiwan, it should give
up its obstruction of Taiwan's bid to enter the WHA, the decision
making body of the World Health Organization (WHO) , as an observer,
Romberg said.
</P>
<P>
Romberg noted that "the orderly and upbeat nature of the
demonstration on May 26 in Taipei reinforced the impression that the
government has sought to make clear that the Anti-Secession Law is
unacceptable in principle and to give Taiwan's citizens a way to
express their displeasure, and that the government has no desire to
do anything to raise cross-strait tensions."
</P>
<P>
Romberg, who once served as U.S. State Department deputy
spokesman, told the Central News Agency that "one hopes that the next
steps will be efforts from both sides to resume progress on charter
flights and perhaps even to find a way to negotiate the 'three direct
links.'"
</P>
<P>
"If Beijing wants to make a positive impression on the people of
Taiwan, it should acquiesce this year in Taiwan's application for WHA
observer status," Romberg said.

KMT CHAIRMAN EXPECTED TO VISIT CHINA IN JUNE: HONG KONG DAILY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Hong Kong,  March 30 (CNA)
(By Lin Yu-kuo and Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chinese authorities have agreed in
principle to the idea of Lien Chan, chairman of Taiwan's main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT), visiting the mainland in June this year,
a Hong Kong daily on Wednesday quoted "reliable sources" as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Ming Pao reported that it was tacitly agreed last year that
KMT Chairman Lien Chan would visit the mainland prior to his assuming
the presidency in May 2004 if he won the presidential election with
his running mate, People First Party Chairman James Soong, in March
of that year.
</P>
<P>
If Lien had visited the mainland in his capacity as the KMT
chairman and a president-elect according to the plan last year,
Chinese President Hu Jintao would have met with him in person,
marking the first rendezvous of the leaders of the KMT and the
Chinese Communist Party in more than five decades, the Ming Pao
reported.
</P>
<P>
The plan, nevertheless, was dropped after Lien and Soong lost the
election by a tiny margin to President Chen Shui-bian and Vice
President Annette Lu who were re-elected for a second term.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted KMT Vice Chairman P.K. Chiang and KMT Legislator
Chu Feng-chih, who are currently on a five-day groundbreaking visit
in China, as saying that if their current visit proves successful and
the mainland authorities indeed show goodwill, KMT Chairman Lien Chan
may visit Beijing in June this year.

PRESIDENT CHEN COULD SET NEW RECORD FOR OVERSEAS VISITS

Taipei, March 30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday he
hopes to make a state visit to the Republic of China's African ally
of Burkina Faso later this year.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while meeting with Roch Marc Christian
Kabore, speaker of the Burkina Faso parliament, who is currently on
an official visit in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
The president told his guest that if an opportunity presents
itself, he would like to visit Burkina Faso again late this year.
Chen last visited the West African nation in August 2000, making him
the first ROC president ever to do so.
</P>
<P>
If Chen does indeed visit Burkina Faso this year, he will become
the first ROC president ever to make four overseas trips in a single
year.
</P>
<P>
Chen visited two of the ROC's South Pacific allies -- Palau and
the Solomon Islands -- Jan. 27-31 this year. He is scheduled to visit
other South Pacific island nations, including the Marshall Islands,
Kiribati and Tuvalu, between late April and early May.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Chen plans to travel to Latin America in August or
September to attend a summit meeting with the top leaders of the
ROC's Central and South American diplomatic allies.
</P>
<P>
In preparation for Chen's second South Pacific diplomatic tour,
an advance team, to be composed of officials from the Presidential
Office, the Government Information Office and the National Security
Bureau, will depart for the Marshall Islands, Kiribati and Tuvalu
Thursday to look into hotel capacity, airport facilities and proposed
activities to be staged during Chen's visit.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Office staff said the itinerary of Chen's upcoming
South Pacific visit will be fleshed out after the advance team
completes its inspection tour.

LEGISLATIVE TASK FORCE TO HELP CROSS-STRAIT EXCHANGES: SPEAKER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 30 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng
said Wednesday that the special task force on cross-Taiwan Strait
affairs that the legislature is planning to set up will facilitate
direct and effective exchanges between Taiwan and China.
</P>
<P>
As to his proposal to invite Wu Bangguo, chairman of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress of China, to visit
Taiwan, Wang said the proposal will have to be approved by the task
force and the legislature before it can be carried out.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who is also a vice chairman of the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) , put forth the proposal a day earlier and immediately met
opposition from legislators from the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) and Taiwan Solidarity Union.
</P>
<P>
On the controversial, on-going Chinese visit by P.K. Chiang,
another KMT vice chairman, Wang said the trip is aimed at tempering
cross-strait tensions.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the KMT hopes to do something for the country and
should not be mistaken as intending to conduct some kind of peace
talks with the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, the KMT is seeking various means to try to
remove the barriers between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
For example, Wang said, a visit by a KMT delegation earlier this
year helped clear the way for the launch of special cross-strait
Lunar New Year charter flights.
</P>
<P>
He said that the visit to China by KMT members is a kind of civil
exchange and that the KMT does not represent the country without the
government's authorization.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the postponement of the KMT chairmanship
election until July has nothing to do with incumbent Chairman Lien
Chan's plan to visit China.

TAIWAN PROTESTS U.S. NOT TO CONDEMN PRC OVER HUMAN RIGHTS

<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan protests Washington's decision not
to initiate a resolution condemning China at the United Nations Human
Rights Commission in Geneva this year, Vice Minister of Foreign
Affairs Michael Ying-mao Kau said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Washington announced in mid-March that it would not be sponsoring
a resolution condemning China at the U.N. human rights commission in
Geneva, citing "progress" in human rights in China, including the
release of Uighur dissident and human rights fighter Rebiya Kadeer.
</P>
<P>
Fielding questions at a Legislative Yuan Foreign Affairs
Committee meeting, Kau said that his office has exchanged views with
Washington on this concern, but that he is willing to openly lodge a
protest against the U.S. administration's decision not to condemn
China's human rights record this year.
</P>
<P>
"It is very regrettable that the United States has decided to
discontinue grilling China over its human rights record," Kao said.
</P>
<P>
During the interpellation session, opposition Kuomintang
Legislator Lai Shyh-bao said Washington's decision was a "gift" given
to Beijing days prior to U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's
visit to China March 20.
</P>
<P>
Lai ridiculed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for having been
"strangely silent" over the U.S. change in attitude while at the same
time sparing no efforts in condemning China's enactment of its
Anti-Secession Law as depriving the 23 million people of Taiwan of
their human rights.

KMT FORGING ACCORD WITH CCP UNLAWFUL: DPP CAUCUS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  30 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It would be unlawful if an opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) delegation visiting China was to forge any "peace
accord" with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), members of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislative caucus said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Hsu Kuo-yung, a lawyer-turned-legislator, quoted
Article 113 of the criminal law as stipulating that if individuals
forge an agreement with a foreign government -- a move that requires
official permission -- without the authority of the administration,
they will be charged and could face prison terms of up to seven
years.
</P>
<P>
Hsu called for KMT Vice Chairman P.K. Chiang, who is leading the
KMT delegation on a "groundbreaking" visit to Guangzhou, Nanjing and
Beijing, not to break Taiwan law.
</P>
<P>
Hsu made the remarks at a press conference in which the DPP
legislative caucus members continued to lodge a scathing attack on
the KMT and to question the rationale behind the major opposition
party's current "China rush" at a time when the people of Taiwan are
still enraged over Beijing's enactment of its anti-secession law
targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lai Ching-teh, a legislative whip of the DPP, chided the KMT for
engaging in the "third KMT-CCP talks, " which he claimed to feature
"three episodes " -- the other two being a visit by KMT Chairman Lien
Chan to China in person for a summit meeting with the CCP head, and a
KMT/CCP joint establishment of a "unification council, " with both
sides exchanging representative offices and both sides pushing for
"three direct links" across the Taiwan Strait and the signing of a
cross-strait peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Lai asked whether Lien Chan will sign a peace agreement with
Beijing, whether he will sign a peace agreement with the People's
Republic of China or the CCP, and whether an agreement signed by a
party that lost the presidential election in Taiwan would be
legitimate.
</P>
<P>
Chao Yung-ching, another DPP legislative whip, ridiculed the KMT
for acting like a peacock, saying that the KMT has fallen prey
without knowing it to the "United Front" of the CCP, which has
stepped up schemes to annex Taiwan via legitimate means and through
exerting pressure on Taiwan businessmen operating in China

PFP REVERSES SUPPORT OF CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM PACKAGE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 30 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A leading legislator of the opposition
People First Party (PFP) said Wednesday that the party has decided to
reverse its support of a constitutional amendment package passed by
the Legislative Yuan last August.
</P>
<P>
According to Lee Yung-ping, a whip of the PFP's legislative
caucus, the decision was made in light of widespread disapproval of
the package among constitutional experts.
</P>
<P>
The package still requires ratification by the ad hoc National
Assembly, which is set to be elected May 14 for the sole purpose of
considering the amendment package. Formed by representatives of
various political parties in proportion to the number of ballots they
garner in the poll, the National Assembly is expected to convene
within 10 days of the election and complete review and endorsement of
the amendments within a month.
</P>
<P>
Items in the package include reducing the number of legislative
seats from the present 225 to 113 and adopting a "single seat, two
votes" legislative electoral system starting with the seventh
legislature to be elected in 2007, as well as phasing out the
National Assembly to allow for popular referendums on future
constitutional amendments.
</P>
<P>
Lee claimed that cutting the number of legislative seats almost
by half will result in the domination of legislative committees by a
small number of legislators.
</P>
<P>
The PFP prefers cutting the number of legislative seats to
between 150 and 170.
</P>
<P>
According to Lee, most constitutional experts believe a
German-style "single seat, two votes" system is better than a
Japanese-style system adopted by the amendment package and that they
are doubtful whether such a system will help improve the quality of
legislators.
</P>
<P>
Also, Lee said, the PFP will seek to raise the ratification
threshold of the National Assembly to a vote by a three-fourths
majority from a 50-percent majority proposed in the draft of the
National Assembly organic law.
</P>
<P>
In response to the PFP's decision, opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
legislative caucus whip Chen Chieh said the KMT respects the PFP's
opinions but that it will stick to the original constitutional
amendment package.
</P>
<P>
Lai Ching-teh, a whip of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
legislative caucus, expressed his regret over the PFP's flip-flop.
</P>
<P>
Lai said the PFP's opposition to the reform package and its
proposal to set a high ratification threshold for the National
Assembly might make the reform even more difficult to achieve.
</P>
<P>
He reminded the PFP that the reform package was a promise shared
by all political parties during the 2004 presidential election
campaign and that every party is responsible for honoring this
promise.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the PFP, the pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU) , which is promoting a campaign to draft a new
constitution, is also against the constitutional amendment package.
</P>
<P>
Angered by the PFP's and TSU's capricious attitude, members of a
private group promoting a referendum on the fourth nuclear power
plant project accused the two parties of setting a bad example and
betraying their political integrity.
</P>
<P>
The Nuke-4 Referendum Initiative Association will launch its
fifth round-the-island walkathon April 2 to push the concerned
parties to complete the reform.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) is
planning to send lobby missions abroad in mid-April to voice Taiwan's
objections in the international community to the anti-secession law
passed by Beijing aimed at Taiwan, Vice Foreign Minister Kau Ying-mao
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Delegations will be dispatched to directly express Taiwan's
stance to European countries, the United States and Japan on the law
Beijing adopted March 14 that justifies an attack on Taiwan if
Beijing thinks the island is moving toward independence, Kau said.
</P>
<P>
In line with the missions, the ministry has also ordered its
missions overseas to issue position papers to make clear the
government's position at a time when the European Union is weighing
whether to lift an arms embargo on China and when the World Health
Assembly is slated to open in May, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The negative impact of the arms embargo lifting by the E. U. on
security in the Taiwan Strait and the health rights of the Taiwan
people will also be heeded when MOFA officials meet their foreign
counterparts, he said, adding that the lobby missions form part of
the government's strategies to counter Beijing' threat against
Taiwan.

<P>
A 34-member delegation of
Taiwan's opposition Kuomintang (KMT) made a historic visit Wednesday
to the mausoleum of the party's late founder, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, in the
city of Nanjing in the central Chinese province of Jiangsu.
</P>
<P>
It marked the first time that the KMT, which once ruled all of
China, has sent an official mission to pay homage to its founder
since the party lost a bloody civil war and fled to Taiwan in 1949.
</P>
<P>
KMT Vice Chairman P.K. Chiang, also a legislator-at large, who is
leading the delegation, laid a wreath in front of a statute of Sun,
who led the revolution to topple China's last Qing Dynasty and
establish the Republic of China in 1911, on behalf of KMT Chairman
Lien Chan and the rest of the party.
</P>
<P>
Led by Chiang, the delegation members bowed three times and
observed a moment of silence to pay their respects.
</P>
<P>
Chiang's delegation was welcomed by hundreds of cheering and
clapping Chinese tourists.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Nanjing city government and the Jiangsu
provincial government in charge of Taiwan affairs, as well as
representatives of major Taiwanese trade associations in Jiangsu
Province, accompanied Chiang's mission on its "commemorative" visit
to Sun's mausoleum.
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon, the delegation flew to Beijing, where Chen
Yunlin, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of China's State
Council, is expected to host a dinner in honor of the delegation.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, the delegation will discuss with the
Chinese authorities in Beijing a range of trade issues, including
whether China will open its market to Taiwan's agricultural products,
medical and health-care operators, banking and insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
The delegation might also meet with Jia Qinglin, chairman of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, before concluding
its Beijing visit and returning to Taipei via Hong Kong Friday, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Chiang's mission arrived in Guangzhou Monday on its visit, which
Chiang claimed is purely aimed at commemoration of the KMT's
revolutionary forebears and exploration of problems faced by Taiwan
businessmen operating in China, also known as "taishang."
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the delegation visited the Huanghuagang Mausoleum of
72 Martyrs in suburban Guangzhou in the southern province of
Guangdong. The 72 revolutionary martyrs died trying to overthrow the
Qing dynasty in the Huanghuagang Uprising prior to the establishment
of the ROC.
</P>
<P>
The visit comes at a sensitive time when many Taiwan citizens are
enraged at China's enactment of a law justifying an attack on Taiwan
under certain conditions set by Beijing. In Taipei, pro-independence
Taiwan Solidarity Union lawmakers labeled the visit as a "trip of
kowtowing to communist foes."
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said the trip's significance seems to lie in
symbolizing rapprochement between the KMT and the Chinese Communist
Party, whose 1949 revolution forced the KMT to flee from China to
Taiwan. Once fierce enemies, the two parties have found common cause
in their commitment to unifying the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
and dislike for Taiwan's independence-minded President Chen
Shui-bian, analysts said.

DPP OPPOSES PROPOSAL TO INVITE NPC CHAIRMAN TO  TAIWAN

<TEXT>
<P>
Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
lawmakers expressed opposition Wednesday to Legislative Yuan Speaker
Wang Jin-pyng's proposal to invite Wu Bangguo, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) of China,
to visit Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Trong Chai said Wang's proposal is very untimely,
particularly in light of China's March 14 enactment of its
anti-secession law targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chai also called Wang's proposal to recognize Chinese academic
degrees "a very dangerous thing, " warning that "Taiwan could be
subverted" by people who receive education in China if the proposal
is adopted by the government.
</P>
<P>
Tsai Huang-liang said inviting Wu to Taiwan is not something the
country and its people need.
</P>
<P>
He urged Wang to stop using cross-Taiwan Strait issues as a means
of boosting his chances of winning his competition with Taipei Mayor
Ma Ying-jeou for the upcoming KMT chairmanship election.
</P>
<P>
Pan Meng-an, meanwhile, accused Wang of betraying the sovereignty
of Taiwan just to win the support of "pan-blue alliance" hardliners.

ORGANIZERS TOUTS 326 MARCH AS SUCCESSFUL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 30 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Taiwan Democratic Alliance for Peace,
an umbrella group formed exclusively to organize the March 26 protest
march in Taipei, claimed Wednesday that the event was the "largest
and most successful rally" in Taiwan's history.
</P>
<P>
Democratic Progressive Party Chairman Su Tseng-chang, who is one
of the co-leaders of the alliance said the rally was unprecedented in
terms of the huge number of people it attracted.
</P>
<P>
It was also significant in that it showed the world that Taiwan
is different from China, where people's freedom of association is
unheard of, and that the island is doing its utmost to keep the
status quo in terms of its ties with China, while China is going out
of its way to alter it, and might resort to force to do so.
</P>
<P>
He said President Chen Shui-bian called him after the march,
lauding the enthusiastic participation of the public and saying that
people's backing of Taiwan is the most reliable safeguard of the
country's security.
</P>
<P>
Wang Mau-hsiung, a leader of the International Lions Club in
Taiwan and a co-leader of the alliance, said the march successfully
cast the island into the international limelight and drew
international attention to China's military threat against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the government should ride on the people's anger with
China to launch diplomatic offenses, including bids to join
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to rebut the Taipei police department's estimate
that only 275,000 persons marched, the alliance released the results
of a survey that shows that 5.55 percent of those interviewed claimed
they turned up for the event.
</P>
<P>
In view of the fact that the country has 16 million adults, the
organizers claimed that 930,000 people took part, which is very close
to their claim of 1 million participants.
</P>
<P>
Based on this formula, the organizers estimated that 230,000
Taipei City residents and 200,000 Taipei County residents showed up
at the march, which contradicted Vice President Annette Lu's
criticism that the capital city's residents were apathetic about the
rally.
</P>
<P>
The survey, carried out between March 28 and 29, collected 1,293
valid samples among adults with the right to vote. It had an error
margin of 3 percent, said the organizers of the march.

HEALTH INSURANCE FEES WAIVED FOR KIDS UNDER 3 FROM POOR FAMILIES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  30 (CNA)

<TEXT>
<P>
Children under three from impoverished
families will be exempted from national health insurance premiums
from April 4 to coincide with the nation's Women's and Children's
Day, Premier Frank Hsieh said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the new measure will benefit 24,000 children, Hsieh
said it will be adopted in line with President Chen Shui-bian's
earlier directive that the government assist low-income families with
young children by excepting the children from health insurance
payments.
</P>
<P>
The insurance premium exemption for children under three will
help reduce the financial burden for low-income families by an
estimated NT$137 million annually, Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
The government has exempted out-patient and hospitalization fees
for all local children under three since 2002, Hsieh said, adding
that the results of a series of public opinion surveys show that 93
percent of respondents support this measure.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh also announced that the government will offer subsidies for
elementary and junior high schools in aboriginal communities to
purchase flat-panel TVs in connection with the planned launch of an
aboriginal TV channel in July.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hsieh said the Executive Yuan will raise the ratio of
female commissioners in various commissions or councils under its
jurisdiction to accentuate the government's resolve to promote gender
equality in political participation and policy formulation.

FOREIGN SPOUSE COUPLES NEED MORE HELP IN TAIPEI: CITY COUNCILOR

<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 30 (CNA)

<TEXT>
<P>
With more and more foreign brides marrying
Taipei citizens, problems arising from these families are surging, a
situation that the government must improve swiftly, a Taipei City
councilor said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference, Councilwoman Lee Ken Kuei-fang
said that the many problems emerging from mixed marriages have caused
an impact on society as a whole and that the government must address
the growing need to re-allocate the country's resources in its
education and social welfare systems.
</P>
<P>
Citing municipal statistics, Lee said that more than 20 percent
of those couples married last year consisted of a foreign spouse.
Some 40 percent of them are couples composed of an elderly retired
serviceman and a young foreign bride, she said, pointing out that
problems related to the large gap in ages, poor financial situations,
inadequate education and juvenile delinquency arising from such
families have markedly increased.
</P>
<P>
She appealed for adequate government attention to these families
and urged that effective measures be put into place to help them.
</P>
<P>
According a Taipei City Government official, 23,382 spouses from
China had their domicile registered in Taipei City as of the end of
January this year, not to mention those from countries in Southeast
Asia and those from Canada, Japan, South Korea and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the municipal authorities have set up an
ad hoc group in charge of providing assistance to couples of elderly
retired servicemen and foreign wives. Assistance ranges from how to
deal with children who grow up in a household with an elderly father
and an young mother, to jobs and education, he added.

PREMIER EXCHANGES DIALOGUE WITH KOREAN PHILOSOPHER

<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Wednesday that
although globalization is the mainstream value of the world today, it
will result in the loss of cultural distinction if localization is
ignored.
</P>
<P>
Discussing the issue with visiting South Korean philosopher Kim
Young Oak, founder of the Institute of the History of Korean
Thoughts, in a seminar held by the Council for Cultural Affairs,
Hsieh said globalization co-exists with localization and that
co-existence is the principle of all cultures.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh claimed that cultural diversity is a special feature of
Taiwan because of its various languages and ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
It is more difficult to seek co-existence in such a multicultural
environment than in countries like Korea and Japan, which he said are
formed by a single nation.
</P>
<P>
Citing the Taoist thought of ancient Chinese philosopher Lao-tse,
Hsieh said "nature" is the co-existence principle of humans, heaven
and earth and that only by following the co-existence of nature will
eternity, balance and harmony be achieved.
</P>
<P>
Kim agreed that maintaining the identity of a regional culture is
a basic issue in the face of the globalization trend.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that Taiwanese identity is temporary because it is
always changing and cannot erase its connection with Chinese culture.
</P>
<P>
According to Kim, both Taiwan and South Korea have experienced
multicultural exchanges and oppression by another country and have
both developed a democracy after absorbing various cultures, schools
of thought and conflicts.

The launch of direct cross-Taiwan Strait
charter cargo flights is pending an evaluation of the possible
effects of the recent enactment of China's Anti-Secession Law,
according to a statement issued Wednesday by the Cabinet-level
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC).
</P>
<P>
The law, which authorizes the Beijing authorities to use
"non-peaceful means" against Taiwan should the island move toward
formal independence, has impacted cross-strait exchanges in the
short-term, the MAC noted.
</P>
<P>
The top mainland policy planning agency issued the statement to
clarify remarks by MAC Chairman Joseph Wu in his speech to the
European Chamber of Commerce Taipei (ECCT) a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
Wu told the ECCT in his speech that immediately after the two
sides of the Strait reached an agreement on the cross-strait charter
flight services for this year's lunar new year holiday, the
government announced that the launch of cross-strait charter cargo
flights was one of the issues it would actively promote and expected
that there would be one regular cross-strait charter cargo flight a

Wu said that he lamented that Beijing had not responded to the

PREMIER CALLS FOR SIMULTANEOUS HOLDING OF 3 LOCAL-LEVEL ELECTIONS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Wednesday he has
directed the Ministry of the Interior and the Central Election
Commission (CEC) to study the feasibility of having three local
government elections held simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before a weekly Cabinet meeting, Hsieh said he hopes the
elections of city and county government chiefs, city and county
councilors, and township and village chiefs can be held on the same
day to save costs and upgrade administrative efficiency.
</P>
<P>
According to original schedules, four elections should take place
from this May through early next year -- the May 14 mission-oriented
National Assembly election, the city mayor/county magistrate
elections later this year, and the elections for city/county
councilors and township/village chiefs early next year.
</P>
<P>
"Holding four elections in less than a year wastes national
resources and increases social disharmony. I hope relevant government
agencies can overcome various difficulties to realize the goal of
having the three local-level elections take place simultaneously, "
Hsieh said, adding that holding the three elections at the same time
can underscore the government's commitment to administrative reform
and upgrade the overall national competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Responding to comments by some politicians that holding three
local elections at the same time could further fuel vote-buying or
election bribery, Hsieh said the misgivings are unfounded. "Both
administrative reform and crackdowns on vote-buying are the
government's main missions. They are not contradictory. It's not
justifiable to claim that holding the three elections simultaneously
would exacerbate or aggravate vote-buying, " Hsieh said, adding that
stamping out election bribery has been the government's long-term
goal.

<P>
Holding three local-level elections on the
same day was favored by 58 percent of respondents to a survey
released Wednesday by the Research, Development and Evaluation
Commission (RDEC) under the Executive Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-six percent favored rotating national and local elections
every two years.
</P>
<P>
The poll was conducted to gauge the public's response to the
Executive Yuan's plan to synchronize the time of various elections to
save money.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Yuan is weighing holding the elections for
county/city chiefs, county/city councilors and township/rural
township chiefs, or the so-called three local elections, at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
Also, the Executive Yuan is studying the possibility of holding
the elections of president and lawmakers, the so-called national
elections, simultaneously and rotating the national elections with
the local elections every two years.
</P>
<P>
In disclosing the results of the survey, RDEC Vice Chairman Chen
Chun-lin said that those who favor this plan cut across party lines,
administrative boundaries and age groups.
</P>
<P>
Only 16 percent of respondents disapproved of the idea of
synchronizing the three local elections, and 11 percent disapproved
of rotating the national and local elections every two years.

Taiwan's top mainland policy planner urged
the European Union Wednesday not to lift its arms embargo against
China.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with an Italian parliamentary delegation at his office,
Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu told his guests that
lifting the arms ban would be misunderstood by Beijing authorities as
the E. U. ignoring China's military threat to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Wu expressed his hope that the E.U. will convince China to
abandon its option of invading Taiwan and to play a constructive role
in improving cross-Taiwan Strait relations.
</P>
<P>
It was very significant for Taiwan that the European Parliament
adopted a resolution to express its opposition to China's recent
enactment of its Anti-Secession Law, which authorizes the Beijing
authorities to use "non-peaceful means" in dealing with Taiwan under
certain circumstances, Wu noted.
</P>

E.U. RULES WILL PRESSURE TAIWAN ELECTRONICS EQUIPMENT-MAKERS: EXPERT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   March  30  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan makers of electrical and
electronics equipment must make their manufacturing and recycling
processes greener to meet stricter regulations that are to be imposed
by the European Union (E. U.), a researcher said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Yang Chih-hsing, a senior researcher at the Industrial Technology
Research Institute, urged domestic producers to swiftly adopt
manufacturing techniques that will meet the E.U.'s eco-friendly
standards for sustainable growth in view of the expected
implementation of two new sets of rules that will restrict the use of
certain substances and require a high level of recycling.
</P>
<P>
According to Yang, the directive on Waste Electrical and
Electronics Equipment (WEEE) and the directive on the Restriction of
the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic
Equipment (RoHS) are slated to take effect in August 2005 and July
2006.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the WEEE directive, starting from Aug. 13 this
year, each producer is required to be in charge of recycling their
own waste goods, he said.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that this requirement will put strong pressure on
Taiwan manufacturers, in particular those with their own brands, he
said that companies operating on a contract basis will also have to
collaborate with their foreign clients.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the RoHS directive, the E. U. will limit the
use of lead, cadmium and halogens, among other substances, beginning
in July 2006, he explained, adding that products that fail to meet
the set standard will be left on the shelf.
</P>
<P>
Yang claimed that more than 30,000 Taiwan companies will be
affected by the new E.U. rules given that the value of Taiwan's
electrical and electronics goods exports to Europe last year totaled
NT$225.8 billion (US$7.15 billion), involving 34,533 businesses.
</P>
<P>
According to an investigation conducted by the Ministry of
Economic Affairs, only 5 percent and 3 percent of the domestic
manufactures are qualified under the WEEE and RoHS directives,
respectively. Around 37 percent and 13 percent said they have yet to
adjust their manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
Ten categories, including home appliances, vending machines,
daily consumption products, telecommunications and information
industry goods, will be subject to the scrutiny of the WEEE and RoHS
in the future.

U.S. EXPRESSES CONCERN ABOUT KMT DELEGATION'S CHINA VISIT: OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States has expressed concern
about the opposition Kuomintang's (KMT) dispatch of an official
delegation to China, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Michael
Ying-mao Kau said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Fielding questions at a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's foreign
affairs committee, Kau said that although the U.S. government has
publicly said it welcomes peaceful dialogue and interactions across
the Taiwan Strait at both the government and private levels, some
American officials have said in private that Taiwan should forge
internal unity and consensus first to enhance its strength in
negotiating with China.
</P>
<P>
As for the KMT delegation's ongoing visit to China, Kau said U.S.
authorities have express their concern.
</P>
<P>
A 34-member delegation, headed by KMT Vice Chairman P. K. Chiang
is currently on a five-day visit. The delegation departed for the
mainland two days after a million-person-protest-march in Taipei
against Beijing's enactment of a law justifying its longstanding
threat to attack Taiwan in case it thinks the democratic island is
seeking formal independence. The pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity
Union has labeled the visit a "kowtowing trip to communist foes."
</P>
<P>
Kau said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has exchanged views with
U.S. authorities on "matters of mutual concern" about the KMT's China
visit. He didn't elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Kau told lawmakers that the United States does not want
to see any "surprise" in the Taiwan Strait situation.
</P>
<P>
He further said the government is committed to crafting a
"framework of peace and stability" for cross-strait interactions and
resolving disputes through dialogue and consultations.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Kau said after Beijing's enactment of the so-called
Anti-Secession Law, cross-strait relations face new challenges.
</P>
<P>
He said the publication of an open letter by Chi Mei Group
founder Hsu Wen-lung last weekend supporting Beijing's "one China"
policy indicates that the "anti-secession" legislation has taken its
toll on local businessmen with interests in China.
</P>
<P>
"Seeking cross-strait peace requires much more preparatory work.
At the moment, the most crucial task is to forge domestic unity and
consensus. We should stand united to let Beijing know that military
threats are counterproductive and unhelpful to cross-strait
engagements," Kau said.

MAJOR PARTIES LINE UP AGAINST SYNCHRONIZED LOCAL-LEVEL ELECTIONS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  30 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Executive Yuan's plan to hold the
three local-level elections together at the end of this year has
pitted the country's two major parties against the three minor ones
in the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Both the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the
leading opposition of Kuomintang (KMT) spoke against it Wednesday on
the grounds that it would be unfavorable to them.
</P>
<P>
In a rare sign of disagreement between the DPP administration and
the party, DPP Secretary-General Lee Yi-yang said to hold these local
elections abruptly without necessary measures to ensure the
elections' clearness and fairness would only give corrupt candidates
a perfect chance to fix them.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Wen-tsan, director of the DPP's Culture and Communication
Department, said to hold elections together may save the government
some money and is therefore a goal worthy of pursuit in the long
term, but it should not be carried out in haste, or it could help
grouped candidates buy votes on a large scale.

Citing a poll conducted by the Taiwan Provincial Election
Commission among the governments and election commissions of various
cities and counties, Cheng said most of them disapprove of this
change, adding that the Executive Yuan should heed the opinions of
these local governments and put the brakes on its plan.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator Chen Chieh, who is the whip of the KMT caucus at
the Legislative Yuan, said the change was aimed at facilitating the
DPP's plan to woo voters with its "pork barrel" policies in all three
elections.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the three minor parties in the legislature, namely the
People First Party, the Taiwan Solidarity Union and the Non-Partisan
Solidarity Union voiced their support for the plan, saying it would
save money for both the government and society.

688 COULD VIE FOR 300 SEATS IN MAY 14 NATIONAL ASSEMBLY ELECTION
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When the election is held on May 14 to
fill the National Assembly, 12 groups of 688 people could be vying
for the 300 seats of the mission-oriented body, the Central Election
Commission (CEC) said Wednesday after announcing that registration
was closed.
</P>
<P>
The CEC will examine the qualifications of the would-be
candidates endorsed by 12 political groups and arrange a draw on
April 21 to determine in what order the groups will appear on the
ballots.
</P>
<P>
Among the prominent parties, the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) fielded 150 people to run on its ticket, while the
leading opposition Kuomintang (KMT) entered 148, the People First
Party 83, the Taiwan Solidarity Union 50, and the Non-Partisan
Solidarity Union 31.
</P>
<P>
According to the CEC, votes will be cast for political groups
rather than any particular candidate, then the political groups will
share the 300 seats in the National Assembly in proportion to the
ballots they garnered.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly is supposed to vote for or against a set of
draft amendments to the ROC Constitution, notable among them is an
amendment to cut by roughly half the size of the 225-seat Legislative
Yuan, and an amendment to change the electoral system for lawmakers
from a multiple-seat constituency to a single-seat one.
</P>
<P>
Among the 12 political groups that entered the race, the DPP, the
KMT and three other little-known small parties support the changes,
while the other seven groups, including the People First Party, the
Taiwan Solidarity Union, and the Non-partisan Solidarity Union, which
are minor groups in the Legislative Yuan, have vowed to vote against
them, according to the CEC.

The Senate, after waiting for an hour and 52

year.

The Philippine Daily Inquirer: Arroyo popularity

THE STAR of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo

widespread corruption, according to results of a
survey conducted by the private polling firm Pulse
Asia Inc.

KMT TALKS WITH CHINESE COMMUNISTS INAPPROPRIATE: PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   March  31  (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A high-ranking Presidential Office
official criticized the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Thursday as
behaving inappropriately by holding talks with the Chinese Communist
Party immediately after China's enactment of its Anti-Secession Law
targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The official was referring to a meeting between a delegation led
by KMT Vice Chairman P.K. Chiang and officials of China's Taiwan
Affairs Office in Beijing Wednesday, in which both sides reached a
10-point consensus covering a wide range of issues including
cross-Taiwan Strait charter flights, agricultural cooperation,
protection for China-based Taiwanese businesspeople, tourism,
journalistic exchanges and the opening of the Chinese financial
market.
</P>
<P>
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the
KMT move was "inappropriate in terms of capacity, timing and
atmosphere" and that the Presidential Office will continue to watch
related developments.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian on Tuesdday called the Chinese visit by
the KMT "out of place in time, " saying it seems as if the KMT is
trying to seek some kind of reconciliation with the Chinese
Communists like the old days during the civil war in China.
</P>
<P>
National Security Council Secretary-General Chiou I-jen pointed
out that Beijing has defined the visit by the KMT delegation as being
on the civil exchanges level but that the objectives of the 10-point
consensus are not something that can be achieved at the civil level.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Michel Lu said
that the Republic of China is a democratic and open country whose
people are free to express their opinions and that any opinions they
express will be respected.

KMT VICE CHAIR REITERATES PARTY'S RESOLVE TO IMPROVE TAIWAN'S ECONOMY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Beijing,  March 31 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Visiting Kuomintang (KMT) Vice Chairman
P.K. Chiang reiterated in Beijing Thursday his party's resolve to
help better Taiwan's economy and improve the people's livelihood,
stressing this is something that requires efforts from both the
ruling and opposition camps.
</P>
<P>
Chiang made the remarks after paying tribute at a memorial in
suburban Beijing to Republic of China founding father Sun Yat-sen in
the Chinese capital. Sun died in 1925 at the age of 59 in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Chiang said he will make a report on his mainland China trip to
the government after returning to Taiwan because adequate government
policies and legislative cooperation are necessary to carry out any
agreement his delegation has reached with the Chinese side during the
visit.
</P>
<P>
Chiang's remarks came after the KMT mission and officials of the
Chinese Communist Party signed a 10-point consensus late Wednesday to
boost civil exchanges between Taiwan and China, ranging from
agricultural and cross-strait passenger and cargo transport issues to
labor and academic affairs. One of the most noteworthy elements was
China's agreement to ink a Taiwan investment guarantee accord.
</P>
<P>
Traveling at the head of a 34-member delegation, Chiang flew to
Beijing from Nanjing a day earlier on the third leg of a five-day
visit to China -- the first of its kind since the KMT retreated to
Taiwan after losing the Chinese civil war in 1949.
</P>
<P>
KMT spokesman Chang Jung-kung said that the opening of regular
passenger charter flights across the strait and exports of Taiwan
agricultural products to China are the two most urgent issues to the
people in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the KMT vice chairman had lunch together with
officials of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
-- Beijing's semiofficial body dealing with Taiwan in the absence of
government-to-government contacts between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Chiang is scheduled to meet Jia Qinglin, chairman of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference, and Tang Jiaxuan, one of
the five state councilors, later in the same day. He is also slated
to have dinner with Taiwan business people based in the Beijing area.
</P>
<P>
Chiang's China visit comes at a time when cross-strait relations
have turned soured due to Beijing's enactment of its Anti-Secession
Law on March 14, which authorizes the use of "non-peaceful means"
against Taiwan should the island move toward independence.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition KMT has repeatedly vowed since
independence-minded President Chen Shui-bian's election in 2000 to do
its utmost to help thaw relations between Taiwan and China.

KMT VICE CHAIRMAN SERVED AS SECRET ENVOY TO CHINA: DPP LAWMAKER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  31  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A vice chairman of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) served as a secret envoy who held covert talks with
the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in Bangkok in 2003 to pave the way
for his later visit to China, a legislator of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) claimed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chin-chun was referring to P.K. Chiang, who is currently
leading a delegation on a five-day visit in China. The delegation
visited Guangzhou and Nanjing before arriving in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Chiang secured a 10-point list of topics agreed upon with Chen
Yunlin, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office under the State
Council, in Beijing Wednesday covering a wide range of issues,
including cross-strait transportation, agriculture, protection of
Taiwan businessmen in China, mainland fishermen and the further
opening of China's financial market.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Chen said that Chiang, a former chairman of the
Council for Economic Planning and Development, visited Bangkok
between Dec. 28 and Dec. 30 in 2003, ostensibly to deliver a speech
on Taiwan's economic prospects over the next four years and to attend
the inauguration of a support group for the "pan-blue alliance"
ticket for president election in 2004 -- Lien Chan of the KMT and
James Soong of the People First Party (PFP).
</P>
<P>
In fact, with the help of KMT-run enterprises, Chiang met with
two delegations from Beijing, Chen alleged, adding that Chiang and
six others met with Chinese Ambassador Yan Tingai as well as a
ranking official from the Taiwan Affairs Office.
</P>
<P>
Chiang and Chinese officials also met in secret on another
occasion, and the time and place is still being checked, Chen
claimed.
</P>
<P>
He said Bangkok has become the "honeymoon" location of the KMT
and the CCP, and that China's present ambassador maintains good
relations with the KMT.
</P>
<P>
The first meeting was held at the Shangri-La Hotel in Bangkok, a
favorite of Chinese dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that the relations of the KMT and the CCP are "beyond
what could be imagined, " adding that the situation was worrisome for
the people of Taiwan because history has shown that whenever the KMT
deals with the CCP, it is the CCP that comes out on top.
</P>
<P>
"The KMT should explain whether it has sold out Taiwan interests
in its talks with the CCP this time," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Soong was in the dark about the talks between
the KMT and the CCP in 2003, and the KMT should also give him an
explanation.

TSU LASHES OUT AT KMT OVER DEAL WITH BEIJING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 31 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The pro-independence opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) slammed the pro-unification opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Thursday over a 10-point consensus reached between
the KMT and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
"The 10-point statement signed in Beijing Wednesday by KMT Vice
Chairman P. K. Chiang and Chen Yunlin, director of the CCP's Central
Office for Taiwan Affairs was an insult to our country, "said Lo
Chih-ming, convener of the TSU legislative caucus.
</P>
<P>
The KMT-CCP consensus covered a broad range of issues, including
charter flights across the Taiwan Strait, agricultural cooperation,
protection for China-based Taiwanese businessmen, tourism,
journalistic exchanges and the opening of the Chinese financial
market.
</P>
<P>
Lo said the KMT delegation had not received any government
authorization before its departure for the ongoing China visit.
Therefore, he went on, the consensus is not legally binding.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the KMT delegation has dared not mention the nation's
title -- the Republic of China -- since its arrival on Chinese soil
Monday, Lo said Chiang had struck the 10-point deal with the CCP at
the expense of national dignity.
</P>
<P>
"The KMT has always claimed it is committed to defending the ROC.
Why is it that no one in the delegation has dared to mention the
nation's title since they set foot on Chinese soil? They also dare
not display its party flag or the ROC national flag while paying
tribute to the party's revolutionary forefathers in Guangzhou and
Nanjing. It seems to me that the KMT delegation has surrendered
national sovereignty to sign the 10-point consensus on humiliating
terms," Lo said.
</P>
<P>
While Chiang has billed the China visit as a move to promote
cross-strait peace, Lo said it has actually hurt Taiwan's national
interests and has embittered the people.
</P>
<P>
"As the visit comes shortly after Beijing's enactment of a law
justifying its longstanding threat to attack Taiwan, it could mislead
the world into believing that the people of Taiwan do not oppose this
law, " Lo said, adding that the visit was an insult to the
participants of a protest march against the new law in Taipei last
weekend that organizers said drew one million people.
</P>
<P>
Chiang's visit was also a slap in the face of the United States
and Japan who have been doing their utmost to persuade the European
Union to maintain its ban on arms sales to China, Lo said, adding he
is worried that the KMT's reconciliation with China at this critical
moment might lead E.U. members into wondering why the Europe Union
can't lift its arms embargo against Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lo accused the KMT of intending to weaken Taiwan's
defense capabilities by stubbornly stonewalling the passage of the
Democratic Progressive Party administration's arms procurement
package from the United States, including eight diesel-electric
submarines, six Patriot PAC III anti-missile batteries and a squadron
of 12 anti-submarine aircraft.

KMT'S AGREEMENT WITH CHINA COULD VIOLATE STATUTE: MAC
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 31 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) signed
any document with the Chinese Communists in China thinking they were
acting on behalf of the Republic of China government, those involved
would have violated an important section of the statute governing
cross-strait relations, Mainland Affairs Council Vice Chairman Chiu
Tai-san said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A delegation led by KMT Vice Chairman P.K. Chiang held talks with
officials of China's Taiwan Affairs Office in Beijing Wednesday and
reached a 10-point consensus on a wide range of issues including
cross-strait charter flights, agricultural cooperation, protection
for China-based Taiwanese business people, tourism, journalistic
exchanges and the opening of the Chinese financial market.
</P>
<P>
According to Chiu, if the KMT signed any written agreement with
China, it would be in violation of the Statute Governing the
Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland
Area, which prohibits civic organizations from signing any agreement
on issues involving government authorities and politics with China
unless they are authorized by the government.
</P>
<P>
According to the statute, violators can be fined up to NT$2
million (US$63,492), and if the offense is considered very serious, a
jail term of up to five years can be imposed.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said the KMT, as a political organization, is unsuitable to
assume the role of negotiator and that it is even more inappropriate
for the KMT to maintain contact with China at a time when Beijing has
enacted its Anti-Secession Law that threatens the use of force
against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
While more than 90 percent of the people in Taiwan are against
the aggressive legislation, the KMT did not pass on this message to
China during the visit, Chiu noted.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said he suspects the KMT reached the 10-point consensus with
Beijing in exchange for a high-profile reception for KMT Chairman
Lien Chan on a future visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Chiu pointed that since the Anti-Secession Law has triggered
widespread resentment in Taiwan, China is trying to win the support
of the Taiwan people by giving them the false impression that the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait have reconciled.
</P>
<P>
He urged all people in Taiwan to unite to reject what he called
the "sugarcoated tricks of China."
</P>
<P>
He accused the KMT of dancing to China's tune in defiance of the
majority public opinion in Taiwan, saying the party failed to conduct
any careful assessment of the possible impact on Taiwan's security
and economic interests before holding talks with China.
</P>
<P>
He said the government, for the sake of national security, its
people's well-being and Taiwan's development, will continue to take
necessary steps to prevent China from doing further damage to
cross-strait peace and stability.

KMT DELEGATES URGED TO ABIDE BY ROC LAW DURING CHINA VISIT
</HEADLINE>

(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Any agreements inked by private
individuals, civic groups or political parties from Taiwan with
mainland China or other foreign countries are invalid, and the KMT
delegates should watch their step while in China, Executive Yuan
spokesman Cho Jung-tai said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Cho urged a visiting KMT delegation led by KMT Vice Chairman P.
K. Chiang to be extremely careful with what they do in China and
stressed that they must not do anything that might violate any
Republic of China law.
</P>
<P>
Urging the Chinese authorities to talk directly with the ROC
government, he said that the government is willing to conduct
negotiations with Beijing under the principles of parity,
reciprocality and mutual benefits, at any place and time.
</P>
<P>
However, any agreements by any individual or political group made
without the authorization of the ROC government with a foreign
government are not valid in the ROC, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The government spokesman's comments came after the KMT mission
reached a 10-point consensus with officials of the Chinese Communist
Party late Wednesday in Beijing to boost civil exchanges between
Taiwan and China, ranging from agricultural issues and cross-Taiwan
Strait air links to labor, academic affairs and the signing of a
Taiwan investment guarantee pact.
</P>
<P>
Although the KMT has made it clear that the 10-point consensus is
aimed at bolstering private sector exchanges, Chiang's visit to China
has provoked strong criticism from the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party at a time when cross-strait tensions are mounting after Beijing
adopted an Anti-Secession Law against Taiwan on March 14.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition KMT has designated Chiang's China visit an
ice-breaking trip, as it is the first of its kind by a ranking KMT
official since 1949, when the party retreated to Taiwan after losing
a civil war to the Chinese Communists.
</P>
<P>
The 34-member KMT delegation has visited Guangzhou, Nanjing and
Beijing since Monday. It is slated to return to Taiwan Friday.

TAIWAN DONATES MONEY FOR INDONESIAN EARTHQUAKE VICTIMS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  31 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Republic of China government has
extended its sympathy and concern to Indonesia after a powerful
magnitude-8.7 earthquake hit the remote Indonesian island of Nias
earlier this week, a diplomatic official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokesman Michel Lu
said the government has donated US$50,000 for post-earthquake relief
projects in Nias.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the government will decide to offer more financial aid or
other relief assistance when the damage caused by the temblor is
better identified.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the report of the earthquake, Lu said the ROC's
representative office in Indonesia conveyed President Chen
Shui-bian's and the government's regards to Indonesian authorities
through diplomatic channels.
</P>
<P>
In addition to US$50,000 donated by the government, Lu said the
Indonesian chapter of the Buddhist Compassionate Relief Tzu Chi
Foundation -- Taiwan's largest charity -- donated 50 tons of rice to
surviving victims in Nias.
</P>
<P>
As the post-quake situation in Nias remains unclear, Lu said the
government will decide whether to offer further relief aid after the
Indonesian government announces its stance on foreign assistance.
</P>
<P>
Monday's quake struck off Indonesia's Sumatra Island, some 120km
north of Nias. An even-bigger quake that generated the region's
devastating tsunami Dec. 26, 2004 hit an area along the Sumatran
coast. The death toll from Monday's quake was estimated to reach

KMT CONSENSUS WITH CHINA WILL BENEFIT TAIWAN: KMT CAUCUS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 31 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 10-point consensus reached between P. K,
Chiang, a Kuomintang (KMT) vice chairman, and Chen Yunlin, the
director of China's Taiwan Affairs Office, is good for Taiwan, the
legislative caucus of the KMT said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The caucus was responding to the legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , which described the 10-point
consensus as the KMT "dancing to the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP)
tune."
</P>
<P>
The DPP also said Chiang's visit was the result of a covert
meeting between him and the Chinese ambassador in Bangkok in 2003.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator Lee Jih-chu said Chiang's delegation is only
concerned with trade, and the 10-point consensus is beneficial for
Taiwan, inasmuch as it covers a wide range of issues, including
cross-strait transportation, agriculture, the protection of Taiwan
businessmen based in China, Chinese fishermen, and the further
opening of China's financial market.
</P>
<P>
As an opposition party, the KMT can only pave the way and
coordinate policy, and the ruling party should be thanking the KMT
instead of inciting the public to side against the party, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator Justin Chou said that the DPP has said
that in cross-strait exchanges where the government is unable to make
headway, it welcomes the private sector to step in.
</P>
<P>
The KMT, as a private group, is doing just that and is now being
given a bad name for it, Chou said.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jin-pyng, speaker of the Legislative Yuan, also said it is
"unfounded" for the DPP to accuse the KMT and China of having
arranged to sign a secret agreement, saying that is "out of the
question."
</P>
<P>
Chiang's visit to the mainland should be helpful to the nation
and the rights of the people, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a KMT spokesman said Thursday that Chiang used the
principle of "Taiwan first" to reach the 10-point consensus with
China, which he said has produced an amiable atmosphere for
cross-strait exchanges, and the ruling party is angry because it
feels ashamed for not being able to achieve such results itself.
</P>
<P>
Chang Jung-kung was responding to the Cabinet's criticism that
the KMT vice chairman's visit to China was in an "inappropriate
capacity, at an inappropriate time and under an inappropriate
atmosphere."
</P>
<P>
Chang said that unless the DPP says that opposition party
officials are not allowed to visit China and that only DPP officials
can, there ought to be no problem with members of the KMT traveling
to China. If the ruling party announces such an edict, Chang said,
the party would obey it.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the "right time" is something that is created,
unlike President Chen Shui-bian who has had five years since coming
to office in 2000 to make a move, and has done nothing but let
opportunities "go down the drain."
</P>
<P>
He also said that the KMT is hoping that cross-strait relations
can return to a more relaxed atmosphere such as was apparent in the
wake of the cross-strait charter flights for mainland-based Taiwan
businessmen during the Chinese Lunar New Year, adding that a good
atmosphere needs to be nurtured not sabotaged.

IMBALANCE IN TECHNOLOGY IMPORTS-EXPORTS MUST BE ADDRESSED: PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 31 (CNA)
(by Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday
that Taiwan's imbalance between technology imports and exports must
be addressed if the country intends to maintain its international
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Quoting government figures, Chen said that the ratio of Taiwan's
technology imports to its exports stood at 1 to 0.25 between 1997 and
2002, meaning that when Taiwan exported NT$1 worth of technologies,
it imported NT$4 worth of similar products at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Amid fierce competition worldwide in a time of knowledge-based
economies, Taiwan must strive to turn its deficit in technology
imports to surpluses in the way that it turned its overall trade
deficit into a surplus over the past several decades to secure
Taiwan's competitive edge in the new "global race" in the 21st
century, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks during an inspection tour of the Industrial
Technology Research Institute -- one of Taiwan's high-technology
research strongholds -- located in Hsinchu, northern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He said that although high-technology products have taken an
increasingly larger share of Taiwan's export trade, up from 18.8
percent in 1985 to 46 percent in 2003, exports of technologies have
been disproportionately low as compared with imports.
</P>
<P>
Noting that although the ratio of Taiwan's technology exports to
technology imports stood at 0.05 to 1 in 1997, a proportional figure
which increased five-fold to 0.25 by 2002, Chen said that there is
still ample room for the country to catch up in this area.
</P>
<P>
Chen promised the country that the government will continue to
funnel capital as well as resources into science and technology
research and development under the banner of "Creating New Values, "
a drive which will be the direction of Taiwan's industrial upgrading
efforts in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
The government will also accelerate efforts to strengthen
collaboration among the industrial, academic and research sectors,
while reviewing or overhauling relevant laws and regulations to help
improve the development of Taiwan's high technologies, Chen added.

CHINA OFFENSIVE WILL CORNER TAIWAN AGRICULTURE: DPP LAWMAKERS

<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's agriculture will be backed into a
corner by China now that Beijing has kicked off an offensive to deal
with Taiwan with a two-pronged strategy, a group of ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) lawyers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Pan Mong-an, Huang Wei-che, Lin Kuo-ching, Yen Wen-chang and Chen
Hsien-chung, all lawmakers from central and southern Taiwan counties,
issued the warning at a news conference at the Legislative Yuan
following reports that a visiting Kuomintang (KMT) mission inked a
10-point consensus with Chinese Communist Party (CCP) officials late
Wednesday in Beijing to promote civil exchanges, ranging from
agriculture and air links to protection of Taiwan investors in China.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, the Chinese side said that they are
willing to provide preferencial measures to allow Taiwan farm exports
to enter the China market and that they would welcome Taiwan farmers
who wish to settle in five Chinese provinces.
</P>
<P>
Despite the offer made by the CCP officials, the DPP lawmakers
warned of a total defeat of Taiwan's agriculture, arguing that the
opening seems to be beneficial to Taiwan farmers in the short term
but pointing out that it will greatly hurt the domestic industry in
the long run.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that competitive farm products from Taiwan are popular
everywhere in the world and that China is not the only market for
them, they speculated that China might ask Taiwan to open up its
market to cheap Chinese goods, leading to a crushing impact on the
domestic industry.
</P>
<P>
Should Taiwan fail to tackle the development adequately, it will
result in an outflow of Taiwan's expertise and the wiping out of the
country's competitive edge, they said.

<P>
The National Science Council (NSC) will
offer 50 job opportunities for second-generation Taiwanese who were
brought up on the island and then studied and settled oversees so
that they can return to work in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
NSC Chairman Wu Mao-kun said that students at European and
American universities do not always go directly to graduate schools
like in Taiwan, as they prefer to travel around the world to
experience different cultures before returning to school to pursue
advanced degrees.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that when these second-generation overseas Taiwanese
enter this stage, the council wants to do all it can to attract them
to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the program, nicknamed the "migratory bird program, "
will be held this summer, and will initially offer 50 jobs, adding
that such research institutes as Academia Sinica, National
Laboratories, and science-based industrial parks can accept them to
serve as assistant researchers or work in translation.
</P>
<P>
By doing so, the visitors can learn about the way things are done
in Taiwan and about its people, Wu added.
</P>
<P>
Noting that second-generation overseas Taiwanese have begun to
shine in their respective disciplines, if they return to Taiwan, it
will help give Taiwan a higher international profile.
</P>
<P>
Prospective employers have agreed to offer the returning
Taiwanese free room and board but they must pay for their own air
tickets, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the young recruits, Wu said that those Taiwanese
who have retired from big overseas companies or research institutes
will also be targets solicited by the NSC.
</P>
<P>
Under this program, Wu said that Taiwan hopes to introduce their
lifelong wisdom and experience into Taiwan, hoping to have them
observe Taiwan's industries, offer suggestions and introduce the
latest innovative and research directions and marketing models into
Taiwan.

PREMIER STEPS UP EFFORTS TO PUSH FOR SIMULTANEOUS LOCAL ELECTIONS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 31 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh has asked his chief of
staff, Lee Ying-yuan, to seek the support of the various parties,
especially the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , for his
administration's plan to hold three local elections together at the
end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Cho Rong-tai, a spokesman for the Executive Yuan, said Hsieh has
asked Lee to contact the DPP, as well as the main opposition
Kuomintang, both of which have spoken out against the changes, in an
effort to sell the plan.
</P>
<P>
Both parties claim that the plan will make it easier for the
other party to rig the elections and will make it difficult for them
to win.
</P>
<P>
Denying speculation that the plan is designed to oust DPP
Chairman Su Tseng-chang by virtually putting paid to DPP's hope of
expanding its political map in the elections for city and county
chiefs, city and county councilors and town and rural township
chiefs, Cho said the idea of holding the three elections at the same
time is simply aimed at saving money and making the process easier
for the voters.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh would like to see the public becoming involved in the
discussion by offering ideas to improve the reform rather than
misinterpreting it as a political scheme and scuttling it, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
In a rebuttal of the DPP's claims that the Executive Yuan has not
solicited its opinion on the plan, Cho said the idea of cutting the
number of elections by holding them simultaneously was initiated by
President Chen Shui-bian in January 2002, and again in September
2004.

<P>
It was raised by the premier in the Legislative Yuan March 11,
when he said the Central Election Commission (CEC) is drafting a plan
to carry out the change.
</P>
<P>
The next day, Cho said, an Extraordinary DPP Congress relayed a
recommendation by its representatives to the CEC calling for the
synchronization of various elections.
</P>
<P>
As this policy was asked for by the president and rounded out
with the recommendation of the DPP, Cho said, it should come as no
surprise, especially not to the DPP.
</P>
<P>
Cho said the reform is not designed to cater to any specific
party and that it would be ridiculous if all major political parties
claim it will do them harm.

KMT DEAL WITH BEIJING DISPARAGES NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY: DPP CAUCUS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 31 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) lashed out at the opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's) 10-point
consensus with Beijing Thursday, saying the deal undermines Taiwan's
sovereign status and impairs its national interests.
</P>
<P>
Chao Yung-ching, convener of the DPP legislative caucus, said at
a news conference that the 10-point consensus signed in Beijing
Wednesday by KMT Vice Chairman P.K. Chiang and Chen Yunlin, director
of the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP's) Central Office for Taiwan
Affairs, was a"sugar-coated poison" and an embodiment of Beijing's
newly enacted anti-secession law targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The KMT-CCP consensus covers a broad range of issues, including
charter flights across the Taiwan Strait, agricultural cooperation,
protection for China-based Taiwanese businessmen, tourism,
journalistic exchanges and the opening of the Chinese financial
market.
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me that the KMT has fallen into the snare set up by
the Chinese communists, " Chao said, adding that Chiang might also
have violated the Criminal Code that bans individual citizens from
signing a contract or agreement with a foreign government without the
government's authorization.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Lai Ching-teh, secretary-general
of the DPP legislative caucus, said the KMT has apparently put its
own partisan interests above national interests by sending an
official delegation to visit China at this sensitive time and
signing the consensus.
</P>
<P>
Lai said Chiang's visit in the wake of China's enactment of its
anti-secession law justifying its longstanding threat to attack
Taiwan has hurt Taiwan in three ways.
</P>
<P>
"First of all, it could help alleviate international pressure on
Beijing over the anti-secession law. Second, Chiang's visit
downgrades the cross-strait issue to a Chinese internal issue and
enhances the 'legitimacy' of China's sovereignty claim over Taiwan.
Third, the visit is tantamount to showing the world that Taiwan
cannot handle the anti-secession law and is falling apart due to
internal division and partisan infighting," Lai said.
</P>
<P>
He mocked the KMT's timidity in dealing with China, saying that
Chiang's mission has not mentioned the Republic of China's national
title since its arrival in China Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The KMT has always claimed it is committed to defending the ROC.
Why is it that no one in the delegation has dared to mention the
nation's title since they set foot on Chinese soil? They also dared
not display its party flag or the ROC national flag while paying
tribute to the party's revolutionary forefathers in Guangzhou and
Nanjing, " Lai said. By accommodating Beijing's demand for
"party-to-party" talks, Lai said, the KMT has compromised the ROC's
sovereign status by agreeing to the so-called 10-point consensus on
humiliating terms.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the consensus fully embodies the provisions of
China's anti-secession law, Lai said the people of Taiwan should
condemn the KMT for striking a deal with its communist foes at the
expense of Taiwan's overall interests. Lai said he is worried that
KMT-CCP reconciliation could bring disaster to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen Ching-jun, chief secretary of the DPP legislative caucus,
also heaped scorn on the KMT delegation's China visit, saying that
the KMT, which ruled all of China before losing a bloody civil war
and fleeing to Taiwan in 1949, owes the people of Taiwan a public
apology for reconciling with Beijing right after its enactment of the
anti-secession law.
</P>
<P>
"The KMT's 'peace talks' have no doubt sent the wrong message to
the international community -- that is, Taiwan itself is seriously
divided over the anti-secession law," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The world "could misunderstand and think that some people in
Taiwan accept the anti-secession law.... The saddest thing is that
the visit has denigrated Taiwan's sovereignty," Chen added.

KMT HEAD OFFERS `3RD OPTION' IN EFFORTS TO SOLVE CROSS-STRAIT ISSUE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Nagoya,  Japan,  March 31 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) Chairman Lien Chan defended the rationale behind a visit to
China by a KMT delegation led by his deputy, P.K. Chiang, claiming
that his party is trying to bail the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) out of difficulties in addressing the cross-Taiwan Strait
issue.
</P>
<P>
Lien, who is in Nagoya to visit the Expo 2005 Aichi, claimed that
in the face of deteriorating cross-strait relations, the DPP has been
unable to address the problem but has refused to consult with the
opposition parties for better solutions.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, Lien said, continuing to evade the issue and act
like an ostrich is one option, while wrestling to escalate
cross-strait tensions is another.
</P>
<P>
As the major opposition party, the KMT is trying to offer a third
option, Lien said, adding that while the government is unable to
address the pressing issue, it would be the people's good fortune if
the KMT helps the government out with wisdom and patience.
</P>
<P>
On the recently enacted anti-secession law which codifies China's
longstanding threat to attack Taiwan if it thinks Taiwan is seeking
formal independence, Lien said that peace is of ultimate importance
and violence can never be a solution.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, it is ridiculous as well as unjustifiable
that the future of the entire population of Taiwan is put at stake
simply because "a small number of pro-independence radicals" are
steering Taiwan's China policy.
</P>
<P>
Lien is visiting Japan at the invitation of the Aichi Expo
authorities. The pavilions that Lien is scheduled to visit include a
mammoth pavilion, a Shinkansen magnetic suspension railway pavilion,
and an International Red Cross pavilion.
</P>
<P>
Lien is scheduled to proceed to Tokyo Friday, where he is
expected to meet with some Cabinet officials and parliamentarians.

PICKING UP NEW ID CARDS REQUIRES FINGERPRINTS: MOI
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 31 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Picking up new identification (ID) cards
will require fingerprints to be submitted unless the existing
household registration law is revised before July 1, Minister of the
Interior Su Jia-chyuan said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) is scheduled to replace
existing ID cards with a new forgery-proof version from July 1 this
year, valid until June 30, 2006.
</P>
<P>
As the current regulations require fingerprints, Su said, the MOI
has been preparing the replacement work in line with this principle
and has begun formulating rules governing the preservation or storage
of the fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
To ensure smooth proceeding of the ID card replacements, Su said,
the MOI has organized training courses for relevant staff members to
be launched from March 31 through April 15.
</P>
<P>
Starting June 1, MOI officials said, local household registration
offices will notify people to submit one photo to be used on the new
cards.
</P>
<P>
The photo must be clear and in color, must be taken without the
subject wearing a hat or sunglasses and must have been taken within
the last six months, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The name and identification card number of the person in the
photo, as well as the date when the photo was taken, must be written
on the back of the photo, they said.
</P>
<P>
People must pick up their new identification cards in person,
while a home delivery service will be provided for those suffering
from a serious disease or those who are otherwise incapacitated.
</P>
<P>
The new cards will be pale purple and will have 21 forgery-proof
features. Unlike the existing identification cards, which have
vertical print, the writing on the new ones will be horizontal.

DON'T VIEW TAIWAN FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF BEIJING: KMT OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Beijing,  March 31 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Visiting Kuomintang (KMT) Vice Chairman
P.K. Chiang urged the Beijing leadership Thursday not to view Taiwan
from the perspective of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
KMT spokesman Chang Jung-kung quoted Chiang as saying to Beijing
officials while expressing Taiwan's contempt for the recently enacted
anti-secession law that Chinese officials should try harder to
understand the feelings of the Taiwan people and should put
themselves in their shoes when addressing the cross-Taiwan Strait
issue.
</P>
<P>
According to Chang, Chiang told his Beijing hosts that Taiwan
independence is not mainstream opinion in Taiwan, but Beijing's
enactment of the anti-secession law, which authorizes China to use
"non-peaceful means" should it think Taiwan is moving toward
independence, is only backfiring -- sending the wrong message to the
majority of peace-loving Taiwan people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chang went on, the KMT delegation has achieved its
"commemoration" and "business and trade promotion" missions during
its groundbreaking visit to China.
</P>
<P>
The 27-member delegation, led by Chiang, also reached a 10-point
consensus with officials of China's Taiwan Affairs Office in Beijing
Wednesday on a wide range of issues, including cross-strait charter
flights, agricultural cooperation, protection for China-based
Taiwanese business people, tourism, journalistic exchanges and the
opening of the Chinese financial market, Chang recapped.
</P>
<P>
The KMT reached its preliminary consensus with Beijing while
bearing the interests of the 23 million Taiwan people in mind, Chang
claimed.
</P>
<P>
Saying that the 10-point consensus will have a positive and
far-reaching impact on Taiwan, Chang said that it will "have to be
implemented" by the Democratic Progressive Party-ruled administration
with the consent of the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The KMT delegation embarked on its five-day visit Monday, making
it the party's first official delegation to visit China.
</P>
<P>
Members of the delegation first paid tribute at the cemetery of
72 martyrs who sacrificed their lives in the KMT-led Huanghuagang
Uprising against China's last empire, the Ching Dynasty, in
Guangzhou, southern Guangdong Province, Tuesday. The death of the 72
martyrs March 29, 1911 is designated as the Republic of China's
National Youth Day.
</P>
<P>
The group then paid tribute at the mausoleum of ROC founding
father Sun Yat-sen in Nanjing Wednesday before heading north to
Beijing later in the day.
</P>
<P>
It is widely speculated that Chiang's mission could mark a
stepping stone to a landmark visit by KMT Chairman Lien Chan in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
Chiang and his delegation are scheduled to return home Friday
after wrapping up their visit.

PREMIER: CEC TO DECIDE WHETHER TO SYNCHRONIZE ELECTIONS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 31 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Friday that the
Central Election Commission (CEC) will decide whether to hold three
local elections together at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The premier visited Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman
Su Tseng-chang Thursday but failed to sell his administration's plan
to hold three local elections simultaneously at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The two told journalists after a 40-minute closed-door meeting
that more discussion is need to sort out their differences.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said he was asked by President Chen Shui-bian to discuss
the issue with Su after the DPP took issue with the Executive Yuan's
plan to hold the elections of local government chiefs and councilors
at the same time, claiming that it would give corrupt local
politicians a field day with fixing elections.
</P>
<P>
The premier said the general public supports the revamp of the
elections by holding them simultaneously, but the CEC under the
Executive Yuan must decide when they will be held.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Su said, his party has always supported the idea of
cutting down the number of elections, but this change should be
carried out with a well-thought-out plan or it will lead to chaos.
</P>
<P>
Noting that grassroots politicians are worried about abrupt
reform without complementary measures being put in place, Su said he
relayed these opinions to Hsieh for his information and that
hopefully, the premier and the CEC will make the best decision.

JOINING WHA IS RIGHT FOR TAIWAN: EXECUTIVE YUAN SPOKESMAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 31 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joining the World Health Assembly (WHA) is
Taiwan's basic right and China has acknowledged that it has been
wrong in thwarting Taiwan's attempts to join the organization by
saying it can help Taiwan take part in WHA technical events,
Executive Yuan spokesman Cho Rong-tai said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Asked to respond to news reports that Chinese State Councillor
Tang Jiaxuan told visiting opposition Kuomintang Vice Chairman P.K.
Chiang in Beijing earlier that day that China "might help" with
Taiwan's WHA bid, Cho expressed skepticism that China, which has gone
out of its way to quell Taiwan's WHA bid for the last eight years,
will change its mind. He added that even if Tang did make the
statement, it would not be worth celebrating. He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
As a member of the international community, Cho said, Taiwan is
entitled to participate in the WHA and the WHA needs Taiwan to close
the loopholes in its desease-prevention network.

NATIONAL SCIENCE COUNCIL TO INCREASE INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The National Science Council (NSC) will
increase its international cooperation, focusing on more than 20
major programs that will link every corner of the world, the
council's head said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
NSC Chairman Wu Mao-kun said that in addition to traditional
technologically advanced nations, the United States military, Russia
and East European countries are new grounds that the NSC is trying to
explore.
</P>
<P>
The NSC and the Russian Foundation for Basic Research will
jointly set up a technology research cooperation fund in June, Wu
revealed, adding that the amount of the fund will be increased
gradually to US$2.4 million in three years.
</P>
<P>
Besides, he went on, the NSC has already had two cooperation
projects with the Russian Joint Institute for Nuclear Research and is
negotiating with the institute to sign a cooperation accord.
</P>
<P>
The NSC has also increased its cooperation with Latvia and
Lithuania by incrementing a tripartite cooperation fund from
US$200,000 to US$300,000, Wu continued.
</P>
<P>
The NSC has also cooperated with French research entities and
will launch research programs in Taipei this summer for French
graduate students.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it will cooperate with the French Institute of
Research and Exploitation of the Sea to organize an international
seminar in Taiwan and one in France this year.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that at the invitation of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, he will attend an international
conference in May in Serbia in which he will give a speech on the
development of Taiwan's information technology and its science-based
parks.
</P>
<P>
The western Balkan peninsula, Central Asia and the Caucasus
region, which are interested in Taiwan's information technology
industry, are other potential areas for Taiwan to explore in the
future, Wu added.

<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian stayed out of a
dispute Thursday between the Executive Yuan and the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) over whether to hold three local elections
simultaneously at the end of this year, saying through an aide that
the matter should be settled by the relevant government agencies.
</P>
<P>
The president's chief of staff, Yu Shyi-kun, said Chen supports
the idea of holding the local elections simultaneously, but said the
details should be determined by the relevant agencies.
</P>
<P>
He said the president's job is to lay down the direction of
policy, while the administration's task is to work out detailed plans
to carry it out.
</P>
<P>
The issue has pitted the Executive Yuan against the DPP, with
Premier Frank Hsieh announcing earlier this week that the
three-in-one election will be held at the end of the year, while DPP
chief Su Tseng-chang warned it is doomed to fail because it will open
the door to massive vote-buying in the absence of complementary
measures.
